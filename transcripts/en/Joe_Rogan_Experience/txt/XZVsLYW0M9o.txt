Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hello. Hey everybody. The Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by [inaudible] dot com that's o, n n I t, makers of Alpha brain, which I'm on now. Brian, are you on it? I'm on new mid on it, bitch. Get on it. I ran out. You bet you take the new mood because you liked to party. You're 34.

Speaker 2:          00:00:20       No, it's just helps me at night. Serotonin

Speaker 1:          00:00:24       son. That's, that's what it is. It really doesn't it? When you do all that crazy shit you oh yeah. Yeah. I didn't do it all the time. It's like a junkie on the street. You, I did it once the other day. Oh, okay. Once the other day. Keep it together, son. Um, yeah. What new mood is, is a, it's five HTP and l trip to fan and apparently the way the body breaks down certain, it's all described on, on a.com. But before I do my butcher job of scientifically hacking through my limited inflammation, um, five HTP is something that it allows your brain to produce more serotonin and l trip to fan converts to five HTP. You're doing it with whiskey. This is a perfect chase. Right? It is the perfect that is, that is it. You might imagine if that would make you so drunk, happy Madge.

Speaker 1:          00:01:14       If it turned out that was like a happy drunk and I'm fine with that. I love happy drunks. Happy drunks are really rare. I'm finding out. So knowing. Yeah, it's super rare. So knowing people that don't know how to handle their shit, dirty freaks anyway on it.com oh and n I t shroom tech sport. That's what you needed to get on Sun man. You need to start working out, get your body in order kid, get your heart pumping and I want you to die. Yeah. You get, you listen, you need to make it work or it's going to give out quick.

Speaker 2:          00:01:47       Yeah. I mean I I consider like I do workouts but the disguised as work, like, like going through the airport with a studio the other day. Like I still a workout. Yeah. I had a boss who is kind, Kinda, yeah. I had a box that weighed probably 50 pounds. I had a book bag that weighed probably 80 pounds and then I had a sore the next day. I'm so sore right now. I have my whole body feels fun. But that was kind of like, let's see, I disguise workouts like that or

Speaker 1:          00:02:12       take shroom tech sport before you go to the airport. Then yeah, you should do it. Help you for rails to cordyceps mushrooms and beat 12. And it's a, if anybody, do you ever exercise? Occasionally. Yeah. I've got to get you on some true shroom tech sport. It's quarter steps, mushrooms, it's fascinating stuff. And on a.com also has kettle bells and battle ropes in Joe. What does a Kettlebell and what's a battle rope? Some manly shit, son battle. So this manly shit, it's um, battle ropes are fascinating. They're giant long ropes, like 40 feet long and you whip them through the air and as you, uh, you're whipping them through the air there. It's like incredible endurance exercise. Incredible for your grandpa. It's great for like muscular endurance. It's a really crazy exercise. Very hard to do. And kettle bells of probably the single piece of athletic equipment as the meow in the background goes off.

Speaker 1:          00:03:05       Yeah. That, that I know of. I think for functional strength, that's probably the one of the best things you can do. It forces you to use your whole body as one unit. There's a fuck load of exercises that are all available online. You can, like, there's a lot of youtube videos and shit and this is a lot of different programs that people have up for free. But if you want something that's gonna increase your, your athletic performance and functional strength, I could think of nothing better than kettlebells. It's like, it's, for me, it's like the best exercise I've ever done for just for, for getting strong, physically strong. So go check it out. Uh, these, these kettlebells are as cheap as we can fucking sell them. It's really hard to do this because you're essentially sending cannon balls through the mail and that's what they are, the giant cannon balls with handles on it.

Speaker 1:          00:03:50       So, uh, they like an old timey exercise. Super Old Timey, black snakes. Well, those old strong men dudes, they that that was, that's like real functional strength when those got, you see those guys in those giant clubs, you know, they would like carry like a mace. It was like a giant pole and at the end of it was like a huge cannon ball and they'd be wielding this and you know this unwieldy object. It's like great for strength and all that old stuff. Like it's like that's way better than like a universal machine. You know those machines, it just kind of like just, hey, you don't find yourself doing that very well. Even if you do, it doesn't really work that way the way you're is. You're not balancing anything. You're just pushing a machine. It can be, you could be pushing more with the right than the left and barely can tell.

Speaker 1:          00:04:32       It's not, you know what I mean? It's not the same thing when you're, when you have to do, like if you're going to do a bench press, you just do bench press. With a freeway like this, there's a lot of athletic benefit in having to balance things out. That's negated when you have like the super mechanical thing that doesn't vary at all. Brandon Miguel Roy's dinner, that savage, so this is a, there's a bunch of different, this is a on on its website we have a bunch of uh, have we talked to an exercises that show, uh, just basics of kettlebells, how to carry out, how to do it safely. And, and the most important thing is to understand that this is not like any other exercise. Everything is usually about, you know, like, like controlled movements like curls or shoulder presses. Like that's how people think of exercising.

Speaker 1:          00:05:19       But with kettlebells you go through like long series of motions and you do basically with your whole body, things like Turkish getups, you lie on your back with his big fucking cannon ball and then you straighten your arm up and then you slowly get up and he stand up like that and then you go back down, back to the same thing, lie on your back and push up this giant cannonball. Oh yeah, it's awesome. Me Put them in a bowling bag or ball bag. That sounds dangerous. It seems like they would probably think you're suspicious when you're dealing with a cannonball, sir. Oh Man. This is a Kettlebell when I, it's an ancient Russian form of athletic enhancement. Did we talk about how there's gut, you're making a bunch of ups drivers workout

Speaker 3:          00:06:02       without knowing for ups drivers, calves. I'm sorry, which I've noticed these fucking things though. I'm telling you,

Speaker 1:          00:06:10       look, if you order these kettlebells are the best quality kettlebells we could find the perfect. They're exactly what you want and were heavy as shit and they will never break. These fucking things will be there when they, when they find the American civilization, 5,000 years from now, some future scientists on hovercrafts, they'll find these crazy fucking cannon balls with handles on. I'm like, what the fuck? What are these crazy bitches up to? That's how long those kettle bells of you're working it out. Yeah. It's proof that pick but big foot existed too. Don't get squashy.

Speaker 3:          00:06:41       All right ladies, gentlemen, honey, honey is here. Oh, you use the code named Rogan.

Um, I don't think it puts you street mountain, but they think Melatonin puts you sleep. I think that's actually a myth. It's a myth that trip to fan put you asleep. I believe that most people, it's just overeating and we associate it with the Turkey because thanksgiving, it's the one day like you purposely ovary like everyone. Delicious smell of the year.

Speaker 4:          00:08:06       [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:08:09       my friends, my friend. Good to see you guys. It's fucking

Speaker 1:          00:08:14       supersite for this. I was, I'm very much looking forward to it. I really enjoyed a senior guys on stage and Coachella from, I've watched it online.

Speaker 3:          00:08:23       You did? Yeah. That's awesome. It was awesome

Speaker 1:          00:08:27       line. It was fucking cool. First of all, that's a really cool feature. They had all the different stages, like everything you could watch it all go down online and I was like, wow, that's uh, that's amazing. I think it's the first year they did that to this. They're, they're changing their sit up like crazy. It's amazing. But when you said that you used to work there selling hot will selling

Speaker 3:          00:08:46       I W I was working there. I'm southern Barbecue Selling Barbara Baby Blues barbeque. Yeah, it was crazy. I went just to go to the festival. Um, but I, I

Speaker 5:          00:08:56       got 100 bucks for the weekend to work and then, you know, I stopped by Muranga on the way to double it, triple it, and then I hung out at the festival and sold, you know, beef brisket. Wow.

Speaker 1:          00:09:08       That's hilarious. It was cool. And then here you were on stage. That was like a scene in a movie that's like finding, that's like a cool scene in a movie. Like when things start to really boom for your career, you get to say something like that on stage.

Speaker 5:          00:09:21       It, you know, it was, it was intense. It was definitely like incredibly overwhelming in a, in a positive and exciting way because you get there and it's just fucking huge. Like, like the, and one of the coolest parts I think about Coachella was that the backstage area where all the artists hang out, like the artist's camp, um, was open to everybody. It wasn't, you know, it's like the sort of like newer bands such as ourselves over here. It was like everybody was walking around like Holy Shit, there's Radiohead and there's, there's Dr Dre and a shit load of weed and everybody, everybody. It was so, that was really cool to just be like, er amongst these people and feel like you belong there. You know it was, it was rad.

Speaker 1:          00:10:02       It was cool. I met ice cube once he knew my name.

Speaker 5:          00:10:05       Of course he did. He knows my, it's like what up Joe? Oh today was a very good day. Yeah. Every time I think of ice cube and ice tea, I think about that youtube or that, that photograph, you know of like the pop machine or soda machine if you will, that has like Coca Cola. Right. And there's a picture of ice teas face over the ice tea and then ice cube over the ice cream. It's so great. Sorry. Just so literal. Yeah. How much

Speaker 1:          00:10:32       she's still trip out, like running into like really famous people like that. And you're like, you will work working with them. What does it, is it, is it a mind fuck? Like what's what's cause it's just starting to happen for you guys. You guys are on tour with Sheryl Crow right now. Right.

Speaker 5:          00:10:46       Ben quit like the fact that she knows our band's name right. The mind blowing apart and then she uses her time on stage. She's been talking about us for like, she'll give like these honey honey speeches. Oh, it was amazing. I teared up, I swear to God. Holy Shit. She's a, you know, she's one of the first people we've toured with that like, I, I mean I used to listen to her when I was a kid and I kind of worship her a little bit. I mean, she's, she's a bad ass and she's, she, first of all, she plays for like two hours in every song is a hit. Yeah. Every song. Jesus Christ and, and um, to be, you know, so amazingly generous to us.

Speaker 1:          00:11:24       Really humbling and just like, it's, it's pretty crazy. I had a, uh, a friend of mine's girlfriend question whether or not I was joking that I was really low like that. It was a CD in my car and I was offended. [inaudible] it's like, how could you not like Sheryl Crow? She's fucking awesome. She's fucking incredible lyrics. Like all the, you don't really have that CD by it. Then you were like, no, seriously get out. How are you fart in my space up, dare you.

Speaker 6:          00:11:54       Oh my God, you guys, that's going to be so trippy. You're in like that really cool stage of the movie. That's really cool stage honestly to be honest with you. Like seriously, like we've toured for years now and like, and no disrespect to the other people we've toured with because they've been incredible. But like from my childhood, like listening to her, I remember like lists like driving in the car with my mother and like making her harmonize with me for the show crow songs. I'm like, no mom, you, I take the top, you take the bottom. Then we, we've come on and I'm just like, do it again and do it again. And just to watch her perform like right in front of me and then to say to say like, Oh, you know, you guys really need to, we need to talk about honey honey.

Speaker 6:          00:12:35       And she really gave us the time up there. Like I fucking freaked out. I was, I was emotional about it. It was really cool. And you see it as a real person too. I mean, I don't, she's very tiny, small or in your pocket, but it's not like this, this product or anything like that. You have the CD in your car, you have a download or a video and it's all these like representations. But then she's right there, you know? And she just saw her once at a Baja fresh. Really? She was in line at the Baja for awesome. I was like, Oh shit. That's Sheryl Crow Burritos. I didn't say anything though. Most of us kept on paying attention to what she ordered.

Speaker 6:          00:13:13       I remember to this day, how many people would do that? Me? Just kidding. Sort of money, creepy people and would steal her food. Ooh, just wrap it up. Pull it out of the trash. Zip Lock it. Yeah. Well that's like, not, not to be disgusting, but you know, they talk about like the seventies stories where like, you know, groupies like steel condoms from like Mick Jagger Zam and tries disgusting. Brought that up. There's, you know, I think it's not as rock and roll anymore as it used to be. The Rock and roll life is not as rock and roll to Twitter. Ruin it. No, I mean, I think there's just like safety issues. It's like, you know, don't go in the trash fishing for use condoms. It's probably not a good move that we've have all teacher, you know, we figured out the fire. I'm really sorry I don't do that.

Speaker 6:          00:14:09       Yeah, don't, don't go doing that. No, but seriously, I think that like you can't, you know, back in the day it was like, you know, I don't know Metallica or somebody, whoever, you know, rage against the machine. I shouldn't name names cause I don't want to misquote anyone. But like, you know, bigger bands would just trash a hotel room or like the 80s it was end of the job. You're not really saying those get bands cause I don't know if any of those, no, I don't. And I love those man. So I shut my mouth. I was just looking. I know I've done that. You've trusted for example, and you go, uh, but, but nowadays, if you disrespect establishments in venues like that, people don't want to have you back.

Speaker 5:          00:14:52       Even if you sell it out, it's like you're, you know, you're the, there's like a sort of a new wave of, of sort of, you know, everybody went to Rehab and then they came back and they realize that you need to be respectful and you know, people are working. That's why Joshua Volta can't get massages at some jewelry. That's why. That's exactly why they were like, dude, stop trying to fuck my staff. Oh Man. Well that's what happens to me. No, I'm just kidding. We'll fucking your staff. No, they don't let me end to get a massage. Yeah, you can't be trash. And People's hotel rooms, right. That's fucking rude is shit. I don't know. Drew to everyone else's stay in the hotel too. They're all going to hear that on the table, but that's about it. That's one of the different one. It's like a motel six. That's true. Like what are we going to do?

Speaker 5:          00:15:48       Motel six by by default. How'd you do that? Well, um, we had a Gig for the 4th of July in Pagosa Springs, Colorado, which was incredibly, you know, just a great time. Is that near? It's like four hours south of Denver. Wow. Yeah, a relaxing spa town. So it smells everywhere. Solferino like, yes, very much so. It's very stinky, but apparently it's like minerals, but it's like, it's so good for you. Yeah, it's, it's pretty, it's funny. I, my, my buddies, I'm staying with my friend Dave. I was Dave, if you're watching this is hey Dave, um, he, his toilet had this like backup thing last night and it smelled horrible, but I was like, oh, that's, that also smells like the hot springs from is healing, healing. And then I, I made, I'm just kidding. Um, but anyway, on our way back from this 4th of July Gig, um, we were, uh, we were somewhere and actually we were in a town called Mexican waters, Arizona and we were at this gas station.

Speaker 5:          00:16:51       Yes. And the Navajo nation. And in the middle of number work, do you have to go through there? Do you have to show id to go through the Navajo nation? Just drive through and you're good to go. They want you to move there though. That's what I was figuring out. How does that work? Look on reservations. You know, can you just, you could just drive in. We just went straight through. Yeah. Hmm. Bought some jewelry, kept growing and they were allowed to have totally different laws there, right? I believe so. Yes. On reservoir. All I know as far as my, um, my experience with, with that sort of thing, it has to do with casinos and yes, they have their own law. They have their own drone law as far as that. Right. If someone calls the cops on you and you're within the reservation of, or that territory, they have their own, their own law or their own police force. Yeah. That's kind of a fascinating trip, isn't it? Yeah. It's interesting. Dover remanence of genocide essentially. But I think that if there's, if there's, if there's a, um, there's some sort of situation that needs to go to a higher level, then it's a federal

Speaker 6:          00:17:50       case and then it's so intense. That's why I just try to mind my p's and q's when I'm going through a Indian reservations. It's fascinating though, isn't it? I mean, it's almost like the radar that it was all stolen, so I can't, we'll just give you so obvious that it was,

Speaker 7:          00:18:05       yeah, so obviously it was, but there's like, is there anything, any greater way to admit it then to have this, you know, areas where you'd like to have a country inside of country side, so they're allowed to, you know, gambling is cool. We like gambling. Come on in.

Speaker 6:          00:18:19       Federal aid works with that though. That's a different thing because you have all these other places that are getting by from federal aid, but then you say, hey, you do your own thing. I, you know, like it would federal aid can't fuck with gambling money. Gambling money is way more than federal aid. If you had to choose between getting federal aid or the fucking Kazillions that casinos Raykin yeah. You know, when you look at casinos, there's a reason why they're so big. Yeah. Ran Places. But it's, it's such a change. There is such a huge gap from the top and the bottom. Yeah. You know, the people that actually own the casinos, a lot of tribes are actually by birth. Right? You're part of the casino. Some very, very small tribes. Um, like there's a tribe, but he gets a check. Yes. That's sweet. Shockapy if you're shockapy Indian your hours, just really, yeah. I tried, I tried to prove it was me. I was like, come on, don't you see them? Nothing. No one, no DNA test. What if, I mean, can they prove it? How can they prove it? Um, and so just like you have to have some sort of a family tree. Yeah. There's gotta be some sort of registration, no proof. I actually have no idea to be honest. I mean, yeah. I, I don't, I haven't figured it out. It is a trip.

Speaker 7:          00:19:32       So when you think about the fact that there's nations within a nation, there's Indian reservations. It's like, it's a really weird, it is interesting. A lot of fights there. When a California, when marrow, when mixed martial arts was illegal, they used to have these fights in the, any casinos. Really the only places that all men, yeah, the Indian casinos would let them come and we would do like three of the key ones that I guess it was the 90s Oh, it was illegal in the 90s I didn't know that. Yeah, like the late nineties the UFC came about in [inaudible] 93 and it was illegal here. After that. It was like you could go and then they got sanctioned and when they got sanctioned that now like we have fights here all the time. I was going to be one next weekend actually. A or August, uh, August 3rd or fourth on Fox. So I'm like, they have him here all the time, but not back then you used to have to go to these casinos were like in the middle of nowhere. You would drive like way deep down these weird fucking roads in the middle of nowhere and you'd find this casino and that's what they'd have king of the cage and it would be in a parking lot. And they fought out, right?

Speaker 6:          00:20:38       Oh Man. Fight Club style. They fun outside rock, which is what we're organizing illegally. And one time these were fighting in

Speaker 7:          00:20:48       a Sydney cause you know, in the rain on this slippery surface. So they're like throwing punches and flying through the air and slipping and sliding all over the place. Companies fracturing, pouring rain. It sounds horrible. Ridiculous, ridiculous. But I mean that was the kind of shit that was going on, you know? And they were, they were allowed to do that only because it was Indian reservations. Really nuts. Stop and think about it. They would do, the Indians were like, come on, it will take your money. Come on in. And Dude, they had no problem with it. You know, like, why are you guys paying such pussies? And meanwhile, they were right.

Speaker 5:          00:21:19       Man, there's, it's a, it's such an interesting subject because like, you know, I'm really into the show deadwood. Oh, the HBO show. Yeah. I'm obsessed with it. I, I fixed myself a whiskey and I watch it for maybe more than a whisky. Um, and it's, you know, it's beautifully shot and um, you know, but it's about deadwood. The town, um, was in Montana. It's Montana or Wyoming, Wyoming Shit. I should know this as a diehard fan. What an idiot. Um, but anyway, it, uh, one of those old west, yes at the time, but, you know, it was one of the last sort of re one of the last towns. Um, that was sort of its own law, which is why, you know, it's so wild and there's all these crazy, you know, there's real cowboys, right? Real cowboys on TV. Um, but you know, that when they're also, you know, in contention with, with, you know, local tribes and things, and there's, there's these gnarly fights and, you know, it's, it's a, it's fictitious as a television show, but it's also, you know, real in a sense that that was, that actually happened at one point.

Speaker 5:          00:22:22       It's, it's a really interesting sentiment to sort of really let sink in. And it makes me really sad, you know, because they were, they were just outcast and, you know, then, then they were on these reservations. And, you know, when you drive through there, it's a really interesting, interesting thing because there's casinos and, and then there's, there's these beautiful historical, um, you know, uh, monuments and things, and like, there's art, there's music, there's, there's traditional elements. Um, and I, it's really, it's like this, like you're, you're sort of juxtapose next to the traditional historic part and then the casinos and then like, what's happening now, which is a lot of poverty. Um, and so it's, it's really, it's really a weird paradox to be in, you know, when you're going through there. And we travel all the time. Um, but you know, not to, not to go back to where I started, but, um, the, the story was when we were talking about, um, messing up a motel six hotel room, um, when we were going through a Navajo Indian country, we stopped at this gas station and, um, I picked up a dog.

Speaker 5:          00:23:27       Um, she's, she's this new little part of my life. Um, somebody left her there for a week and, um, it was really, yeah, yeah, she's, she's amazing. Um, and she just ran up to me and like Kinda gave me like a, like a little dog hug and I was like, oh, whoa, whoa, Whoa, what are you doing? And you know, the, the people of the, the gas station, we're like, yeah, she's been here a week, you know, people drop their dogs all the time. And I was like, oh, people can suck it. I'm taking the dog. But our first night with her, she, I think she was freaked out because she was outside for a week and, you know, eating out of dumpsters. And then, um, you know, we brought her in the hotel room and I had her outside for like 20 minutes. I was trying to get her to go to the bathroom.

Speaker 5:          00:24:09       It wasn't happy. She wasn't going all day, all day. We, we thought we thought she was pregnant and I was like, oh no, this is going to be really bad. Um, and then when we stopped at this, this Walmart to get the necessary accoutrements for dogs, like, you know, treats, leashes, I'm in the parking lot of the Walmart. She took the biggest dog shit I've ever seen take. And I needed two bags and it was like five pounds disgusting. But then she didn't look pregnant. I was like, she looks starving, but you know, we, we took her around and, you know, we basically, um, we're, we're trying to get her to go. And she, she sort of went a little bit and I think she was freaked out. But uh, to make a long story short, in the middle of the night, she hopped up, not even, we all went to bed. She, she hopped in bed with our tour manager. And just peed like, like in like gallons. And this was after we'd, you know, we'd wash just as clumps of hair washed or who was, he was a big deal. She's a wild dog essentially. I don't think she's, she definitely, she is now. She is. That was the only time I've seen her just be an asshole. And I was like, her name is Louise and I was like, what the Fuck Louise, you have some manners to the Shell gas station?

Speaker 3:          00:25:22       No Way. No Way. No Way. I mean, who hasn't peed the bed at some point, right? You probably, you probably need to live a little more sun. We should really challenge ourselves, Ben, and you know, really just drink ourselves calls. Do you get though? We think about peeing in a dream and you're like, you motherfucker. And then you wake up that I felt that in my adulthood. I'm not going to lie. It creeps, creeps, creeps right up to the door. It's like, man, maybe we just go into this breath real quick and P and I'll walk in and zip. I go, I'm not in a bathroom while I'm sleeping. Mother fucker get angry. Do you have an enlarged? No, it seems pretty normal, but it's, you know, there you go.

Speaker 5:          00:26:15       I talk in my sleep. That's as far as it goes. You know, I full on discussions. I could have a full on conversation with someone and not know it and it was truthful, which is, you know, when I should stop.

Speaker 3:          00:26:29       Here's kind of fascinating though that you can have, I mean I think most of us have had that happen in some time in your life where you thought you were at a bathroom and your dream and you peed. I haven't done that. Never when you were a little kid thing. So I actually peed in like where I woke up and I'm like, I'm peeing right now. This is crazy. I mean I do that like you know, once a week. But where are you in bed when this is how many going you imagine if like Brian just came out and told us he pisses the bed once a week. That's so funny. It's like totally normal. I'm driving right now. He has a little, have you ever had a pee in the car? Never had a piano car. I peed out of my door while dries into a bottle. God, that's impressive. And you just hadn't cracked peed in a Gatorade bottle. You just got to. Exactly. I think it's like, you know, if you're, if you're stuck in the car

Speaker 7:          00:27:29       and you and you don't do that, your options are pissed all over yourself.

Speaker 3:          00:27:33       [inaudible] break something internally. Right. It's hard to know where that line, right. Where is, are you being a pussy? A little bit of pampering? Oh yeah, for sure. We have a nozzle. I'm definitely, I've definitely had some got to run over and actually when we were, we played Sasquatch. I went and peed behind a haystack and I felt really good about it. I felt like it was really authentic for the festival that we were playing and I was really in a bad spot. I had to go,

Speaker 7:          00:28:02       one of my favorite moments of travel and meeting random people that has to do with a Girl Ping in front of a hotel. There were, I was with mark the Hammer Coleman. He's just a UFC heavyweight champion dude. And me and him, there was a, we were at this weird little strip club place in uh, Augusta, Georgia and this is like,

Speaker 3:          00:28:22       we've been there. The pink pony that's in Atlanta is like 96, maybe somewhere around then

Speaker 7:          00:28:31       the sex. And um, there's this girl that's working there and she's got really stinky breath and she keeps trying to,

Speaker 3:          00:28:37       Oh that's me. It was terrible. It was what? She was really good

Speaker 7:          00:28:40       aggressive and she was one of those girls. It was like a white girl, but she talks like a black girl and she's like, oh you don't even know what the fuck y'all missing. You know, you don't even know what the fuck you. So she winds up, mark winds up leaving, we wind up, this girl is friends with a girl that is with mark. So

Speaker 3:          00:28:59       this girl stuck with her in the car. She's wearing wrestling pants or wrestling, wrestling shoes and sweat pants and shit. The whole time we're in the car. You don't know what the fuck y'all missing. You don't know what that was the beef sandwich you had for lunch? Cause I can smell it. It was the most ridiculous thing ever. We get to the hotel

Speaker 7:          00:29:17       and mark grabs his friend and bails

Speaker 3:          00:29:21       leaves this like literally, literally grabs her and runs with her and this one is stuck outside, so she's like, I need to know where mark the mother fucking hammer Kallman's room is. She's like yell in the lobby. They kicked her out of the hotel. She pulls down her pants and pulls down her periods. She's p right. And like the foyer area. She got me out passing in

Speaker 6:          00:29:42       the street like I'm some kind of fucking animal. Oh my God. I hope you videotape that knows there was no videos back in 1996 wow. To have a fucking camera with you back then. You'll be carrying some with phs. Yeah. Big Ass. Big Ass taping it. Wow. I'll never forget her. I'll never forget her. She was sober, right? Yeah, they should. They kicked her out when they were trying to kick her out. You wanted to use the bathroom, which is one of the things that people will do to try to regain control. Like if you getting kicked out of a bar. Okay, okay, I'll leave. Let me use the bathroom first. I'll leave. So it's like you get to leave sort of on your terms. You get a little dignity, get a little power back.

Speaker 6:          00:30:23       That's what she was going to tip. She's like, she's like, well they were kicking her out. I need to know where I marked a mother fucking Hammer Coleman's rooms. They're like, ma'am, you have to leave. You have to leave in. The security came over. So I lead but I need to use a bathroom. I need to use the bathroom. And like she really did have to leave it after she did. She squatted down and pushed her sweat pants for us so she wouldn't be on him. I'll never forget the, the, the river of pis. I'll never forget standing there shaking my head. That sounds adorable. It was fantastic. I wish I knew her name cause I could follow her on Facebook cause I know she says some awesome shit. Oh, you know y'all got me out of here passing in the street block on some kind of fucking animal. Never forget that. Like, like follow. Yeah, yeah, please.

Speaker 5:          00:31:13       Yeah. And those are fun. Road stories are the best. There's so many, you know, you meet the most interesting people and only for a second, you know. Um, and uh, yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:31:23       Do you find it weird how different the vibe is from city to city that the cities are so it's very, it's so interesting isn't it? You're like regionally, it's, yeah, it's really bizarre when you try to absorb the whole United States as a whole and try to just wrap your head around how many different communities and entails how huge it really is and how, and how

Speaker 5:          00:31:46       different it really is in different parts. It's, it's amazing. I, I have, uh, I prefer those. No. You know, the sort of like peeing in the middle of the, the foyer or a lobby area moments, which is usually some of, you know, you're in the deep south and that's, there's some fun happening. Hopefully nobody gets shot. Hmm. I feel like not, you know, I love the South Africa and obviously I'm not, you know, calling out, um, you know, public urinating. But like, I find that I'm in this southern style, you find a lot more sort of a candid kind of person that, you know, there's, there's all these puns and things that are so brilliant yet so simple, you know, like, like, you know, sweating like a whore in church. That's my favorite of swing. No horns. Like, yeah, that really is a southern thing. That's another thing. And there's still, I mean, they're infinite. There's so many of them. And I just, I want to go down there and your puns, you know, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna learn the, the southern vernacular and it's like an arsenal of all these amazing things and yeah.

Speaker 8:          00:32:47       You know, there's, we have a good one. I card broken down in the parking lot of this place because, uh, we were just waiting for AAA or something to come and then we roll into this sandwich spot. It was a subway, possibly. So it might've been a Blimpie or something like that. Doesn't matter. The point is, and uh, the, these two people, once we had ordered the, the woman who was making the sandwiches in the sky, I'd walked in the door, just started bringing up the Lorena Bobbitt story or something.

Speaker 5:          00:33:14       Lisa, I think the, Lorena Bobbitt had been released from prison or something or something had happened or, or a Bobbitt uh, the, the man had done a porno or something. Like there was something that he had done, something that had happened in the media that the name was relevant. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          00:33:30       But yeah, and there's just conversing and then you know, it gets, this poem is woman. She's sitting there cutting a roast beef and she goes, yeah, she just,

Speaker 5:          00:33:36       through that Dick in the middle of the highway, how often do you hear that? Do that dig in the middle of the highway and almost it on his bitch. I like, do you want extra meanings? Yeah. And some chipotle sauce.

Speaker 8:          00:33:50       That's the south certainly has a lot of flavor. I love it. I love it. Yeah. I'm a big fan of Texas. Favorite places to perform. It's great. And I did my last special in Atlanta. Did you land with the shit? That's probably been the place we spend the most time it struck great. I'm a strip cause with this place called the pink pony, Costco Strip clubs. There was like the Walmart, Costco,

Speaker 5:          00:34:14       there's every, every flower and just everything you want. It was our first, it was our first strip club experience. We, yeah. W for me. Was He not you? It was mine. We, we're just, we are with our first record company. Um, and there, um, are you familiar with the band jackal? I've heard the name. So you know it was a, with 80s, 90s, 80s, 80s and 90s. 80s, 90s. Yeah. I think he cock rock his cock cock rock. Yeah, he would call it that. Okay. Well there's a member of the band is, he's the lead singer. Yeah, Jesse James Dupree. How many people are right now? Dude, you don't know who? Jacqueline Jackal. Well, Jesse James Dupree is, is it an unbelievable, amazing human being in it and a good friend of ours. And He, um, he actually was affiliated with our record company. Um, and um, by the way, he plays the chainsaw. Huh? He plays a chainsaw on stage. He had created a guitar out of a chainsaw. There's not too much of a, of a two notes that's harmonious, um, you know, addition to the music. But it's more of like it's a real chainsaw and he, he will play it and then he'll usually like shred things like a wooden chair on the stage. We were opening for our friend Rocco Deluca and Jesse James came out on shredded things and it's fucking terrifying cause please, please don't cut your leg off. Oh my, Oh my God. He just,

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       how is that legal? I don't know. Yeah, it just kind of happened, but they're playing this like dirty blues rock down to the I am damn damn to contain and he just goes wrong. Dual apart. That is so crazy. Yeah. What does the audience go? Bananas. You have skin. It's insane. How can you not that must go ape shit. But the, but afterwards they took us in a like a banana, yellow limousine

Speaker 5:          00:36:03       from like the night like eighties or nineties, like a old limo, like, like stretch, limo. We get picked up, um, by Jesse and there they are. There he is. Oh my God.

Speaker 9:          00:36:19       Oh my God. I'm on with the, so I can hear it. Oh, there it is beyond awesome. Jesse j. That man

Speaker 5:          00:36:29       took us to our first, my first strip club experience,

Speaker 9:          00:36:37       man. He can really belt it.

Speaker 3:          00:36:41       He's very a AC dcs. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:36:43       Yes, yes. They have a huge following. I mean they, I think they tore every summer for like a month or so. Um, but he, he's incredible. And so we, we did like a, we were in Atlanta for like 10 days, like four years ago, um, five years, probably longer than that. But five or six years ago we were brand spanking new. Like we hadn't even done our first record yet. We're just trying to figure out how to, you know, we're like, okay, I guess this is what bands do. And we get picked up by Jesse James Dupree in a yellow taxi stretch limo. But, uh, you know, from the 1991. So it's a real old looking vehicle and there's, there's a case of Miller lite and he's like, you know, we're going to the Strip club. And I just like, I remember being like, is this, it's like I think this is what we're supposed to do. We're supposed to fucking get down and like, and then like, you know, flash cut to like these fucking huge tits in my face and I'm getting my first lap dance okay for by another record exec. And you know, she kind of bit my neck and that was fine, you know. But it was just like, he was really weird and she and I smelled like her later.

Speaker 5:          00:37:43       You like wow. Okay. But um,

Speaker 3:          00:37:46       it's a weird thing. Yeah, it's a weird thing. It was like 21 years old. Their bakery, strange light, Gray area, you know, cause it's not prostitution. No, but an intimate moment, they're intimate with you for money. Like they want to get close to you. I mean, it's nothing wrong with it. There's nothing wrong with it. And it like, I don't think there's anything wrong with prostitution. I think if you want to do it, I don't, I don't recommend it. But I would say that there shouldn't be laws against it. Legalize it. Yeah. If there's not laws against fucking people, why should they be laws against fucking people for money? That's crazy. That doesn't make any sense. It's like just, it should be legal. I mean, I'm not saying you should do it. You definitely shouldn't do it. Don't do the freedom. I don't know how I feel about it to be honest with you. I'm just kind of like, you know, just uh, I just think the last care of everybody took

Speaker 6:          00:38:35       care of yourself. But I think the last like laws like that, like why you most says, cause it doesn't restrict anything. It just still happens. Then this happens the league and he just happened to illegally and then people are doing things in a risky, isn't it legal troubles in Nevada? No, it's not. It's legal. It's legal in certain parts of Nevada. Very small area. We did a thing for it and the man shows like, it's like a one county, I think it's really okay. That's really interesting. Do whatever the fuck you want. It's really interesting because that particular brothel, if he willing to be to throw back, um, is, is very, you know, it looks like they have a nice system, you know, as far as being clean and, and safe, you know, the clients that come in, you know, it's not like how's it getting, you know, cut.

Speaker 6:          00:39:24       Yeah. I mean look, you should be able to, if that's what you want to work, you should be able to work there. It seems to me that you're not hurting anybody. It's the music thing does, if our Kickstarter account doesn't take off guys, I will be in the check book and find me in that one county in Nevada and um, don't tease with Keven you, he's like, that's all there is a little baby steps. I don't want to be a clerk in a seven 11, although actually I, but before we do that, I would love to work at trader Joe's, trader Joe's, they all think very happy that everybody's so happy. They're healthy food. Probably get a discount. If they didn't hire me, I would definitely end up in that brothel.

Speaker 6:          00:40:05       Definitely there's not a lot of options here were pretty obvious. That's where it'd be weird when you watch those movies, the old west and they always had a brothel and it was always like every fucking street was exactly the same. It was a dirt road and there was a bunch of buildings real close to each other on one side and a bunch. And that was the whole fucking town. I mean it was like the most unoriginal architecture set up ever. And it was like the dumbest engineering one straight town. There was your breath holders you're building right now. It's fun. Entertainment has no bounds. You know what I mean? Like there's so many different flavors now. Must've sucked. So hard to be stuck in the wild west. Could you imagine how bad or very little laws? I mean it's just people were killing each other.

Speaker 6:          00:40:48       We had to get used to body odor cause I'm sure people smelled fucking terrible all the time. And they were all three where it was an actual reality that people would have draws. They would draw each other and see who could pull their gun out the quickest. And shoot you, that was an actual reality that there were guns by a lot of town. You get killed by bandits or something or the Indian tribe that you stole the land from, he's going to kill Ya. Yeah, and there's a lot of those towns, they did a make it, they just, they were there for a little while and then the mine dried up or whatever the fuck was dragging people. They're dried up and that's it. And then you could go through a whole town and see, oh, real ghosts. It's fascinating. Ooh, you can feel the energy.

Speaker 6:          00:41:35       It's, it's pretty wild at sounds so hippy dippy. But there's a guy that named Rupert Sheldrake and I think he believes that there's some type of memory in everything and he is in the eye. The idea is that like, like even objects like the, the actually do contain some sort of memory. That's why people get creeped out in a house where someone was murdered. You don't want, even though I happened a long time ago, you don't want to be in that house. You don't want to be in that spot. It was like New York City. I feel like there's such a powerful energy there because there's so much residual memory there. You know what I mean? It's like there's definitely that. There's an energy to it. Right. Where were we? We were there, uh, like a couple months ago we were on tour and um, you, we were stopping to get some lunch and in the middle of, um, I'm not sure, like mid town area.

Speaker 6:          00:42:25       It wasn't there. There's this like cemetery literally in the middle of tiny little cemetery in the middle of the block. And it was so interesting because I think it was sanctioned off. Like you couldn't build anything there. It was, it was legitimately protected and he was so like, it was from like, was it like the 18 hundreds? Yeah. Well then you realize all these towns like New York used to be a city like that town. I mean it was, it wasn't just one member gangs in New York. That was pretty awesome. Awesome. Cameron Diaz redhead. Yeah. What? Yeah. Daniel Day Lewis got us killing mother fuckers. God Damn, that dude's a bad motherfucker. That movie. Jesus Christ, would it build the butchers? I went, his name was, that was what New York was really likely. You think of New York. It's always being like, hey, beep Hong Kong. No, no, no, no. They were on the fucking horses band. They started out on horsepowers. Yeah. With cleavers jacking each other. They're on the streets. Have you read any Caleb car books? No. There's a book called the elitist. Um, and then, um, yeah, Angel of darkness, darkness is the other one. Um, but he, he's an incredible author and had written these amazing stories about New York in a very dark, um, but, uh, circa

Speaker 8:          00:43:35       crime novels or historical crime novels. They're amazing. And it's like this, it puts you in this world, the late 18 hundreds in New York City. Um, and, and it bases around this figure who using psychology to solve these serial killings for the first time. You know, like the first time the psychology and psychiatry is used to analyze these crimes. Um,

Speaker 6:          00:43:58       anyway. But yeah, but like the visual of the town is pretty wild because it's, he uses actual, um, like actual places that were relevant to the time and it's, you know, it's pretty, pretty interesting. You know, there's a lot of gangs like things in New York and things like that. Cocaine and prostitution and you know, all the great things that are happening now forcibly less, right. They were, they were crazy back then. There's a lot, I mean the idea of living in sort of a semi lawless place like that, we just had to kind of count the sheriff to right a

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       wrong and go get this poor guy and he's ready to retire and he's got a stupid gold star on like in the movies. And that's what life on the road is like. Wait, looking out for the sheriff, who is the sheriff and honey honey? Oh God. I don't know. Maybe you guys having a power struggle right in front of me. Definitely not to play tennis. This morning I was up three games. It was up three nothing and I was fucking killing it. And then I got cocky and it's my fault, but you know what I can you say it's your fault if he says, well, I got cocky and then my niece and I couldn't get those far right shots and it was, I lost six, three and I felt like a chump. It seems like you're to get really mad at it. Didn't talk to Ben for like an hour.

Speaker 3:          00:45:19       You getting mad when you lost. I was really compounders of the above. That was a big moment for me because I know some people have to learn how to not be angry at people when they play games with them. I Games is when I was a little kid. I used to have that. Yeah, would be angry if I played a game with someone and they beat me and be hungry. You know what's funny? I only do, I only do that with Ben. I swear to God though. You weren't really upset at him for an hour. We know I was upset with myself and I was like kind of a game. No, not really. She's entitled to beating me real like, but she's not beating me something. And you say why new moods working? Yeah, it's already kicking off the whiskey.

Speaker 3:          00:46:11       Um, how long have you been playing tennis? Um, I don't know. I mean I didn't play well when I retired as a professional, dammit. Probably like six or seven years, you know. But like recreationally speaking, something that always looked really fun to me. It's really great. It's great. It's great workout. I played it once. Total body kind of thing. My friend rich syslog is a really good tennis player. I played with him once. That's it. I don't know to be honest with you. It's really fun. We actually started playing as a band because both our bass player and drummer play and you know when you're on the road you have very few opportunities to get physical exercise. I mean those should be a good way to get it out. Yeah, we have a really good time. So the whole competitive thing is harmless. It's just kind of funny. There's like you have these little championships within yourself where I'm like, I am going to beat Ben because I, I need this. I'm going to play the solo tonight. Not Allowed to talk into the mic. Guys have negotiations. That's kind of cool. Have like rock, paper, scissors to what songs do it onstage all the time. It's really, you guys seem to get along really well

Speaker 5:          00:47:36       for a guy and a girl in a band together. I mean that's, we were just talking about that actually because it's, it's really difficult right now. There's, there's a lot of, um, I've been a real asshole. No, you haven't. You're fucking great. I've been the assholes. I was such a Dick on the way over here. I was so, so basically we're dealing, we really did. I was, I was like, I wanted to kick my dashboard. I was, because I haven't slept for like three days. We, we'd been on the road and you know where you draw sometimes you drive after a show and then you get to a hotel. And like, in my mind, I'm like, you have to sleep. If you don't sleep, you're gonna be fucked tomorrow. And then I'm thinking about sleeping, I don't sleep. And then you get exhausted. And with exhaustion comes like a slight bout of depression.

Speaker 5:          00:48:22       And I'm, I'm not a really, I'm not a depressed depressive person when I am, I have to like really tackle it. Right. Cause I want to, I want to rise above. Um, but it, it's definitely, um, another element that you really have to contend with on the road because you're constantly in these uncomfortable positions. You're not eating well, you're not sleeping, you're, you're playing every night and you're traveling and you're like in a van for eight hours, sometimes 10, 12 hours depending on the drive, which is part of where we're at. And part of why we should talk about our Kickstarter campaign, um, because it's, it's, you know, where we're at basically. But I, I was kind of a monster on the way over here. We were in bumper to bumper traffic and I was not to you, it was mainly mainly about myself. I was, I don't attack you or your person, but, but we were talking about how, how funny it is that after being a band for like seven years, we're pretty resilient. Like we don't, you know, at the end of the day, like Ben's my best friend and I love him and I don't want to make him feel bad or hurt him ever.

Speaker 3:          00:49:25       Well, I feel like that's why we've been able to be a band for seven years because we'd just been fighting the whole God damn time. That's how it works. You're stupid. You're stupid. You're figuring out how to make up every time. You know what I mean? It's like what are the biggest thing? What are the fights usually about?

Speaker 5:          00:49:39       The lives is a very well, both. The first thing that comes to mind is driving. Um, I usually I get mad at you. You

Speaker 3:          00:49:48       fine with it. Yeah. We fight a lot in the car when it's like turn left, you know, that kind of shit. That's loud, fun, know. That's always really fun. It's like the stupid shit. It's stupid. It's, you know. Did you guys watch our video? No, not yet. Oh, what is this? That's our Kickstarter video. I should go to the bathroom now. What is the Kickstarter thing about? What's it about? Well, you should watch it and then I guess we'll talk about will this bit because some of these people are, listen, ready. We need money for our next tour. I love you too and

Speaker 10:         00:50:28       so brave. So brave. No, we're sorry we didn't tell you. This is for folks. They have a chicken and the roots. Lipstick on their face. Donkey Guru.

Speaker 11:         00:50:52       They're about to have sex with a donkey. Travel hundreds of miles to see you. We are on a dark path and you seek your counsel

Speaker 8:          00:51:01       in exchange for your advice. We offer you the body of Suzanne, my band mate and friend. She is a young woman. New Bile, great

Speaker 5:          00:51:10       flexible, a donkey guru. We're actually on offering the body of Suzanne and I think who my associate meant to say is he's offering his own body to you. I'm positive. That's what he meant. She talked about it. Absolutely.

Speaker 10:         00:51:25       You know, we didn't talk about this at all, but I didn't figure it out. I know. I don't think, I think that's a terrible idea of whether the chicken, it's a rooster. Whenever

Speaker 5:          00:51:34       in exchange for your pearls of wisdom nuggets, we would like to offer a very warm and loving companion, violet von Rooster. Stein a violet has been with us for the past 47 days. We found him in New Mexico. We hope you humbly accept this is off right?

Speaker 10:         00:51:56       That'd be cool. Flowing with the roasters

Speaker 11:         00:52:02       going towards the donkey and they were on their knees. Now the donkey is having sex with the rooster for your audio.

Speaker 10:         00:52:13       He liked it. Take your time. Donkey. He's still having sex with it. He's slow. First thing I love, how high were you guys when you made those high points? I mean, it really showcases Ben's acting skills. This is one of the weirdest fucking thing I've ever seen in my life. That doesn't give the one last thing. We can offer you our most prized possession. Oh, we took a little, but that's fine. We share it with you this way. Take this piece of our heart and we're just looking for answers. Guys gives the Jack Daniels dunking. Be The fucking Jack. Dan, how do we get back to the raw?

Speaker 8:          00:53:02       Ooh, stocky. We're sorry if we've wasted your time, but this isn't for us. You don't have the answers we're looking for. We're going to go now. Thank you and good.

Speaker 10:         00:53:17       No, you know what? Fuck you. You guys, you guys play not,

Speaker 3:          00:53:27       you guys might be crazy. There's a purpose to this.

Speaker 8:          00:53:33       If you've made it this far, you are either a die honey honey or you're just really into donkeys, which is understandable because the donkey is a magnificent beasts. We created this Kickstarter project to fund are rigorous and also vigorous touring schedule, which as emotionally priceless as it is, which is the truth, has left a gaping black hole where the money should be. Um, life's hard. You gotta roll with it. You've got to roll with it. Um, our goal is to raise $17,000. This will cover our van rental. Our tour manager are stalwart bandmates Patrick Taylor, also known as [inaudible] jazz and Jerry Porter, uncle Jaggedy, Jay eggs, also gas and merchandise. Yes. We're so thankful for all the support we've gotten this far. We just want to keep making this music, uh, performing it all over the country. He may be the why and whether you donate money or just send your happiness and good vibes and love. We are overjoyed to be reaching him. Touching you, touching you touched by you. You've definitely touched us. Record guy

Speaker 3:          00:54:53       guys. Really a doctor. There's something going on. I'm going to refresh it now because this hasn't been refreshed. Oh my God, that's fantastic. I'm on to make a deal. No, that's good. That's really good were but honestly it's just what people are doing now.

Speaker 2:          00:55:14       Oh yeah. Is this the new thing? Yeah. We've been like one of it's creating like the last six months. I feel like all of these people are coming out with these kickstarters and so how does it work? It's like you just, you tell them like say like you want a pizza and like do you want to order a large piece? You don't have any money put in Kickstarter saying like, Hey, I helped me buy this pizza people and if I can make $15, I'll let you have a bite. If you're anywhere near me and then they give you $15 and then you go by.

Speaker 5:          00:55:43       We actually have an incredible reward system. Um, it's really fun. I swear to God you were talking about workouts earlier. Um, I mean the top, the top reward for, I feel like I should go from the bottom and start, but the biggest reward is if someone donates $1,000, which is incredible, you know, donation unless you a player. What I mean?

Speaker 3:          00:56:06       Damn well there you go up and drop it. K One cane on honey, honey man. What up? Other than all the rewards beneath the thousand dollars, which are really fun workout video specifically to you as warriors of the road, we have effective

Speaker 10:         00:56:24       and innovative measures to stay in a quasi peak physical condition. Employing tactics like sarcasm, cloying, temptation and yelling.

Speaker 2:          00:56:33       Let us see your Billy blanks. You guys are ridiculous. What is wrong with you guys? Times different. I have a question that what it is or is it just your silly $500 one? It says you get a half hour Skype with whiskey and with hangout with Suzanne and Ben's. Eat your, your, you get to Cam with you now. Ben, do you have to be there? I do actually. What is the over under stop too? What's the over under on Dick Pics? I don't know. How many are you gonna get in return? Hello? Can you see them as they see you sweat? That could waste, cause I didn't see a lot of ducks. I haven't camped in a while, but half hour with whiskey. I think I might get a little weird. Have you heard this

Speaker 10:         00:57:22       Facebook push? They're uh, they're, they're trying to get people to log in the youtube comments through Facebook. So you use your own identity now it's kind of interesting. I like that idea. Yeah, that would stop a lot of cons. Yeah. Stop a lot of Cantinas. Yeah. What if you found out the conti has comments where by someone, you know, you're like Q sata had the worst news of a patch. Cool comments can really, really get under your skin, but you really need to be the better man and walk away. You do. But it's a fascinating thing that the people can just reach out to you. What did we find out? It's all just one person, like the chocolate rain dude or something like that. I met him, Brian, we did this. I'm one of those things. Weird things for Twitter was for Twitter, right? It wasn't a tweet. The Twitter fest or some of fast, yeah. Who made the chocolate rain guy? You gotta Pee Rocket Chocolate Rain Guy and we haven't talk about you by the way. FYI. If Brian gives you a chocolate bar, how was it? And it says only eat half. I would say only eat a quarter.

Speaker 10:         00:58:34       It's, you know, it's like, it's like you're trying to do a bear, run up an icy mountain. That's what it's like. Your eyes were his life. Oh my God. It's probably as high as I've ever been on earth doing a, yeah. Making your own bars. No, he just needed some. We were, we were talking about how ridiculous these things are because you never know what the actual dosages as part of the problem with a peanut illegal.

Speaker 2:          00:59:04       Well you do regulate it either. This is like the La speed weed and on the back it says 17% THC and it tells you that the amount that's in it, but you have no idea what that means. It's like, oh yeah, it's 17%

Speaker 10:         00:59:16       THC. Well, we live literally in the wild west of weed. I mean, this is a crazy time. There's never a

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       timeline that we can go to a store and there's hundreds of them and you just buy the weed like that. That's it. That should even exist. Look at it that it says, actually it says right here, it says pat package contains a 1.5 grams of Skywalker Oji. So these gummy bears, I'll give you an idea. One point. Yeah. We eat all of them. Yeah. If you need all these sort of [inaudible], what does a normal winter, what's your Candy Bar State? How many grams is that? Oops, sorry. Uh, this contains, uh, where's it say, did they actually have to do that? Is that like a new thing? No, I think that they just do it. The Elliot speed, we'd people. Oh, okay. So there's some people who have like a system. Yeah. So you just got to get to use to their system. Right. Because you never really know. It's the weirdest thing. Like you can buy from someplace, the first of all, the people that work there, daycare. But if you work at a weed store, chances are you go deep, you know, chances are you go really deep. So they go, well I would say eat a half. Don't listen to them. Don't listen too much. This is a one ounce. Oh man,

Speaker 5:          01:00:28       no, just kidding. How are you guys taking edibles? I just got back. What's happening? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:00:31       Yeah. Unfortunately I think we took a little too much. Oh, do you want

Speaker 5:          01:00:36       chocolate? No, I, I recently had a very troubling experience with that. With an edible. Yeah. No, I don't really smoke weed that often. Like I'll, I'll hang sometimes, but I kind of just turned into it an idiot. Right. And when we were at Coachella, my buddy gave me a jolly rancher and, um, I, you know, never, I've rarely, like maybe like every once in a while, you know, smoke a little bit. Yeah. And they were like, take half. And I was like, well, I can't really fucking bite it, so I'll just take the whole thing. I was so fucking high. I was so excited to see Radiohead for the first time. And I was, I was, I was upfront, like thank God. Like they, they did this incredible thing where they gave you an artist viewing area and it was right up front. And I literally felt like I was floating above them and I was freaking out. Wow. It was amazing. Actually. You know what? I'll be honest with you. I'll, I'll totally out myself as a girl. Um, how dare you. The, the super fucking foxy dude from true blood was standing next to me. The the, which Werewolf? The Werewolf. His name's Joe mentioned Leonoda Leo.

Speaker 5:          01:01:44       He's a beautiful man. And you know, you could tell he probably uses a kettle ball bell, kettle bell. So let's talk about his, his incredible, um, and muscles. No, I didn't meet him. I was just high as a kite and I was by myself, which was probably stupid on my part. And I looked to my right and he's standing next to me. I went, oh my God. And then he looked at me and I, no, you did. Yes, I did. And then he kind of slowly started. I started to like drift through the crowd and I was like, oh my God. Like I've dreamed about this moment. This is not how it's supposed to go. It's supposed to involve a lot of other things that are really exciting and incredible and it didn't happen and I was just mortified and how it, yeah. What a fucked up time to meet. I hope that there are second chances out there. Let me tell you, but I found Ben and I was like, Ben, you can meet me. I can't feel my face.

Speaker 7:          01:02:40       Yeah, you don't. If you don't get high a lot, if you don't smoke a lot of pot, you really shouldn't be fucking around with those edibles. I'm just a boozer, especially around like 100,000 people with cigarettes. I think that's exactly very tricky. It's very tricky.

Speaker 5:          01:02:53       Well, you know, you learn your lesson and yeah, I consider myself humbled by my experiences at this past 2000 years and

Speaker 7:          01:03:01       12 Coachella. I've said this a hundred times on the podcast, but just in the interest of information, when you eat it, it's a totally different thing. When you eat marijuana, it's processed by your liver and it produces something called 11 hydroxy metabolite. This is like four to five times more psychoactive den THC. So that's what's going on. So when you take it and you're like, you don't feel high, you feel like, like you're gone. I felt like I was hallucinating. I really did. Well it is, it is. It looks like a dog. Shit was happening. I was floating. Well, if you closed your eyes too, you would see amazing things behind your eyelids. I mean, you see, um, I, I've, I've taken in Gunton on planes before and you, you have these, these shows where it'll do this show under your eyelids. Like you close your eyes and you watched like neon cartoon things, fuck each other and it's incredible.

Speaker 7:          01:03:53       Super Potent Shit. And it's, you know, it's not the same thing as the smoking it. It's a totally different experience and it's not something you should just play around with. That's why those, do you remember that I'm thing where the cops stole some pot from some kids they stole like in that pot round. No, no real, it wasn't in the movie. Super troopers in a real life situation. When they called nine one one they thought they were dying. Yeah. They thought they had been poisoned. They thought they were dying. They thought they might be already dead. Wait, I'm sorry. The cops, the cops did. The cops took these kids. We'd, and then they ate it and then they called nine one one. The cops actually called nine one one because they thought they were dying. They were, they were freaking out so bad. They look, you got to call nine one one call them.

Speaker 7:          01:04:33       I'll call fuck it. I'm going to call. It was just regular. No, they thought they were poison or something. Brownies. But I mean, do they eat them because they're like, oh, those look tasty. No, they, they were, they stole the kids pot and made pot brownies and these fucking dummies didn't know how to handle it. They didn't know how to like, didn't know what the dosage was. So then they freak out and then they'd call it, they call nine one one and they have to fucking explain where they got all the weed from. And what happened. You crazy assholes. They thought they were dead and you can't get that high. You can get, apparently eating hash is like the nuttiest thing ever. And there's, there's like ancient texts of like these incredible psychedelic experience that people experienced while they were eating Hash, you know? And so it was like who the, the of a lot of their, you know, the I, the idea of a, about the mystical world, you know, was based on this, this consumption of hash and these crazy wild fucking trips.

Speaker 7:          01:05:27       They would go on these, it's really similar to mushrooms, animals when you hit, when you eat a lot. Yeah. It gets really similar. When you eat a lot, it gets really similar, gets it, gets really self examine a Tori, you know, it's, it's like great for clearing out psychic baggage and you know, exposing parts of your brain, like think like people call it insecure or they call it paranoid, but really it's probably just being aware, you know? I mean do, you should kind of be freaking out a little bit. You know, we live in a crazy world.

Speaker 5:          01:05:58       It's kind of like after you have like a really good cry and then after that you're totally like, everything's cool. You can handle whatever cause you're just, he got it all out, you know, you're too exhausted to bullshit. Yeah. So you just have to be at, at your truth.

Speaker 7:          01:06:12       Whoa. Yeah. Yeah. Dude. You know, some of your best ideas come when you're fucking exhausted.

Speaker 5:          01:06:20       Maybe that's what's good about how we feel right now, Ben, because we're, I feel like I, I might spontaneously combust sometimes. Yep.

Speaker 7:          01:06:30       Fucking businessman. Yeah. You guys are super talented in a tough business. You're in a weird spot. Thank you. If you came along. No you are, you're in a weird spot because if you guys had come along like just a decade earlier, it would have been a real simple path to record sales. A little bit of simple path to, you know, your own personal financial independence just based on your art maybe, you know, it's tough. I everyone is it like there was some easy time. It never was. I don't know if there was, you know, but I'm saying what I'm saying is that at least you could sell records then. Yeah, that's true. You can't sell records anymore. You can, but the, the, the amount that it's been chewed down because of a, I mean it's probably pretty good with iTunes, you know, but it's no where near what it used to be. Not even close. What is the debt, the damage, like how much has the music industry record sales and stuff you think been damaged by the Internet?

Speaker 8:          01:07:23       Well, I mean cds at basically killed cds and that's what most of the structure has been based around, you know, all these distribution methods. All these companies have built themselves up around physical products, but that doesn't really exist. Right. So now they're trying to adjust to these digital sales methods and there isn't like the framework,

Speaker 7:          01:07:42       right? So they have to invent it on the fly and some companies fail

Speaker 8:          01:07:45       or they just do, they have to listen to what iTunes tells him, you know? Whereas before they were kind of making up the rules.

Speaker 7:          01:07:50       Wow. That's crazy. How quickly it changed, isn't it? You should talk about that. Spotify thing was perfect. Oh yeah, I heard they screw people. What I heard Spotify has been screwing artists.

Speaker 5:          01:08:00       Oh hell yeah. We've got 9,400 on our, what? We got another 300 out of five on our, sometimes somebody told me, somebody told me recently that Spotify doesn't pay the artist for sure.

Speaker 8:          01:08:12       Don't barely at all at all. It's like pennies on the dollar. And that's like

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       most internet things because it's trying to figure out how you could possibly offer this huge library of stuff to somebody for like 10 bucks a month. You know? Cause that's what people want to pay. Right. Well, how could they do that? Right. The idea is like that that becomes like a, like a, like a free trade radio sort of a situation. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hmm.

Speaker 5:          01:08:37       But I mean, here's the thing, it's like I don't, I don't feel like, um, uh, agro were malicious or angry towards that mentality because, you know, as long as people are listening, that's great. Right. You know, but, um, we're alive band at the core. So when we're touring is when we're, we're actually generating some sort of income, which is great. Um, and you know, but at this point it's like you have to find these clever ways to try and make a living. And I don't think we're, I don't think we're far, but like the reason we're doing this Kickstarter account is cause we just want that like that, just a little bit of a leg up so we can support the people that are around us that are working very hard. You know, it almost just as hard as we are and, and then, you know, keep, keep the sort of windfall ball rolling, you know, that that can, you know, get to that place where you're really sustained, you know, and you're really, you're really going. And um, you know, at the end of the day we were talking about how hard it is here and there and like we're, we're tired and um, but like we made this choice and we know that and I'm, I wouldn't do anything else, you know, unless I, if I'm doing this for 10 years, but I don't, I don't think that's going to happen, you know, hopefully. But um, you know,

Speaker 1:          01:09:47       you don't think what exactly is going to happen in 10 years. I'll have to find another job. You don't ever have to find another job. Right. I mean, isn't it all just about more people seeing your stuff, more people hearing your stuff. It's never really about finding another job. Yeah. You guys are slow build man. Yeah. That's what it, it's a slow bill. That's, I think that was the point. I kind of don't ever really talk about, you don't ever really think about stopping this and finding another job. Do you know it's all fucking cry? No. Don't you cry Joe Rogan. Derrick, have you guys thought, but is it frustrating? Is that, yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:10:20       Yeah. I mean we're, we're both, um, you know, crashing with friends and stuff like that. Like we, but that's okay. Like that's part of being a musician. It's like you don't get rich, you know, quickly and you don't, you know, sometimes you never get rich and that it's not about getting rich. We're, we're trying to do what we love for a living and, um, it's hard right now, but, and you need a lot of help from your friends. Like

Speaker 1:          01:10:41       in this day and age, artists make the majority of their money touring. So majority, either that or there's like publishing channels, it's still exist. If you get your stuff on a TV show TV, there's actual money there. But that's such a tiny window, you know? So, and what we're trying to do is just get to a point where we can have the people who support us really. Um, get to a point where we can support ourselves. You know what I mean? So it's a really interesting concept. The uh, the idea of like forming little communities like that on the Internet,

Speaker 7:          01:11:14       you know, cause you know, you're really, you're going to, you reaching out to the people that really enjoy your stuff and they want to hear more of your stuff. Like you can go right to them. Yeah. It's just you, your voice, your little Kickstarter video, right to them. No filter, no nothing.

Speaker 10:         01:11:29       Yeah, that was fun. So it was, it was, have you really tested this patient? What are you trying to do here? In the end, it was really funny. I really came together well, but I was like, you guys are you guys, you're on drugs not telling me the truth. Oh, that's amazing. I want to sit in front of a camera and be like, this is what we want to do. Right. Well, you know, you guys, you guys are silly, but it's good to be solid. You know,

Speaker 7:          01:12:00       keep too many people are trying too hard to be cool. You know, you're way better off being silly.

Speaker 10:         01:12:06       Substitute Chili's fun so he's fun. Serious is annoying. That was a important moment. I think when we realized as Joe was watching it, it's like, oh wait, we made a movie with a dunk. Feels like what the fuck is with the lipstick on the cheeks and it's a rooster. Are you guys doing your chicken Brewster thing? Hey Brian, we're never going to

Speaker 7:          01:12:29       put oil on that door. You know why? Because people are complaining about it.

Speaker 10:         01:12:33       Are they really a myth? So can you please put some Debbie d 40 on that door. It's a fucking door man. Do you trip? And we are in your house and you have a conversation and somebody opens up the door. Do you trip? Do you go, what the fuck mom? Grow Up. You little baby. So the door squeaks. Who Cares?

Speaker 7:          01:12:52       So many people can be so negative assholes experiencing a lot of love on the road though I got up, I saw a lot of positive tweets about people they went to see you. I saw a lot of that.

Speaker 10:         01:13:03       We've got so much Rogan love, honestly, like every single place we went and that, this is no joke. It's like there'd be at least if there were, if it was a small night, there'd be like five or 10 people that came from this, but like in every city, awesome. 40 to 50% of fans from, from you, which was really cool. Cincinnati, it was a huge, yeah. That's so awesome to hear those Ohio people are great. The fan base in Ohio is huge. That's why we need to go back to [inaudible] after the show. They need to go to Cleveland to, yeah, it's a good town. I did Cleveland with Charlie Murphy. Oh, nice venue. I forget. It was one of the comedy

Speaker 7:          01:13:39       clubs. It was, um, man, I don't remember which one it was. It might've been the Improv if there's an Improv there, right? No, it was the hilarity. It's or something. I don't remember. Sorry. I did a, I did a tour with Charlie Murphy and we did like 22 cities. Yeah. And it was a month. So it was like constant. You never knew where you were. So

Speaker 10:         01:14:01       that's crazy. Yeah. I did grog shop with Joey is, what is that? It's grog shop. That's where me and Joey Diaz went uh, last month or two ago or whatever. That's

Speaker 6:          01:14:12       the club you went? Yeah. And is that Columbus or Cleveland? I was in Cleveland, but yeah. So you guys went to like a rock club or something like that? It was like a, I think they do both, but I think it's mostly music. But it was cool. It was a nice little place. Next set up dude. I penises on the walls every time we played there and my family's there. I'm just Kinda like Ah, cause he's turning penis isn't that? It's great. Yeah. And yeah, it's like, it used to be a real grunge kind of punk bar, you know, rock and let me get in there and we play. Or like folk rock, blues music and it's fine. You make it work. Did you ever run into like a stumbling block where people didn't want to hear that kind of music? Do you ever in a situation where like nobody knows who you are and you want to go and do your stuff and for whatever reason people like heckle or act negatively.

Speaker 6:          01:14:58       We've been so lucky man. I feel like we played in all these situations where we're completely different that we've opened for a lot of headliners that we don't sound anything like and no one's ever really put us down and I've got this arsenal of comebacks that I'm ready for it to be like to throw out at that one guy who's being a dick and I can't use them. Guess where you guys, it's pretty nice to you guys. You guys are creepy. I'm not inviting anyone to be a jerk. Please love us. You guys are creepy talented. You guys are really good. You guys are, you know when we went to see you live I was like, this is like, it's crazy that you can watch someone like that close, like singing, like it's such a different experience when you're in a club. I guess it's probably the same as a, as a comic too.

Speaker 6:          01:15:44       Like when you're, you're in front of like a tight group of a few hundred people just jammed into a place that really is like the best scenario, like the best kind of show. It was so powerful. It was like, wow, this is wild. I am fascinated by music cause I can't do it at all. So I'm like, I'm watching you guys do magic. You're putting together songs and you're playing instruments to me. I'm like, you're, you're doing magic. Like I can't do that. I can't do anything with it. So it's uh, it's amazing. It's so fascinating. It's a, it's really just to throw it back, it's like we have a set list and we have this like, you know, rarely do you have to go off book, quote unquote like every once in a while you get a heckler. But we like people, we like to hang, you know what's fine hackleback and then you do your thing.

Speaker 6:          01:16:31       But like, you know, with comedy, I feel like when you get, you also have a sort of set list, you know, so to speak or your material that you have planned. But the off the cuff kind of stuff and it's kind of terrifying because you can't have a low in your comedic set like you can when you're tuning your guitar in a musical set. Yeah. Nobody wants to win while you get your shit together. Exactly. Don't exactly what the joke there. They need to be stimulated like almost to the second. Yeah. But it's still way easier then when you guys do, I don't have to work this

Speaker 3:          01:17:12       video because you have, I'm pretty sure there's a Joe Rogan and Brian Redman is for parents in there. It was great. It turned out so great. Thank you. We're so excited and it was awesome. Really Weird. Sing a lot of it. Yeah. And then seeing them because I think we need to see their scene. Oh, you did. Oh, that's awesome. Yeah, so it was really cool to see like if these people that I talk to all day,

Speaker 5:          01:17:38       not to be totally graphic, but he said, I'm going to, I'm going to come.

Speaker 3:          01:17:42       Doesn't that, that's what he said. He did that on purpose. He was like, I'm just going to explore what they're good for. You Martin. And then the pastor dude was really cool. Yeah, I guess he, he just does it like, oh, there's a Jason Ritter who was awesome.

Speaker 5:          01:17:57       Do you hang out with him that day? He's a sweet dude. Why did you kill him? I don't know. Because he, he, he wasn't, uh, he didn't love me enough. That was funny when he did the zipper part. That was, that was perfect, man. He thought he was going to get some and then that's how bitches,

Speaker 3:          01:18:19       oh, so you've been getting a lot of road booty. I mean, are you a, do you have a lot of guy fans that are right at the point? Brian? Brian, let's talk about your girlfriends and then I'll talk about my boyfriends. No, don't talk about his girl. It's not clearly one of them had a tail. Like a literal tails. No, no, no. Please, please.

Speaker 5:          01:18:44       Just kidding. I'm sure they're beautiful and lovely and very smart. I, uh, I'm single. Are you really? Yeah.

Speaker 7:          01:18:53       Shizam son. That was a message.

Speaker 3:          01:18:55       Sure. Well, what do you do? Radio Kurt? Green Light. Do you want to hang out with queen honey? Yes, I do. [inaudible] rumble, honey, honey and Jack. Then just six kids to pass the bottle and the ice. Let's get shit.

Speaker 7:          01:19:11       Oh my God. How many days when you guys go on the road, how many days do you go for like what's a, what's a long two months? As long as we've got two months. I think

Speaker 8:          01:19:20       we did a couple of those, but yeah, man, it's been like for the past year and a half, we haven't taken more than like three, four maybe we've taken four weeks off at one point. But since then it's just been constant, which has been, I mean it's, it's amazing like she said, but it's disorienting too, you know?

Speaker 7:          01:19:39       Well, so fascinating because you guys are so talented and you know, it's, I'm, I'm, I'm getting to watch like this whole, uh, emergence of you. Like, you know, you're going on this tour, getting all your shit on the internet and it's growing. It's, it's, it's fascinating to watch. It really is. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          01:19:56       Cool. Yeah. It's you cool to see. Yeah, you can see numbers built. That's the different, is kind of where it used to be. Like when my space came out, all of a sudden you had these numbers, that's signs of things.

Speaker 5:          01:20:08       Right? But you sure right and didn't it, you guys do it by youtube is like your youtube numbers, is that what it is? Um, Facebook and Twitter, he's spoken Twitter, you know, the, the angel of death video. We're kind of waiting for this to hit some sort of swing cause it's, it really is such a great video. And um, but essentially it is, it is Twitter and Facebook, but you know, um, we're trying to try and make as many videos as we can. Farm animals still a death video is still you guys on that roof. That's how I found out about you. This, this, this dude on my message board named balls. Yeah.

Speaker 10:         01:20:42       Yeah. Balls of steel. Where as long as he's out there somewhere, he was super psyched when we were talking about him on the podcast. He sent me a message. Um, Gosh, well yeah, that one where you guys were on the roof. That is a fucking, I love that one. That's my favorite. That was like, this is so interesting. This guy sent me a message. He goes, this is your new favorite band. Wow, man. What a guy. We're going to find you balls of steel. How Bob Dylan do you look right there and son, you look, you look mad. Bob Dylan, their kid right there. I got hugs. Yeah, that's it. I'm done. Oh Man. Sorry. I remember that. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          01:21:29       no, no. Now we're now that we're buddies, you know, the first time, you know when we found out that you liked art music, we had this weird day where all of a sudden I was like, I didn't really know how to use Twitter. And actually because of of y'all, we kind of really hopped on board to, you know, really work in the Twitter circuit. But all of a sudden our Twitter accounts kind of going crazy. And then someone's like, Joe Rogan tweeted at you. I was like, really? I was like the guy from Mexico.

Speaker 10:         01:21:57       Sure. That's awesome. And,

Speaker 5:          01:22:00       and then I, I really did my research, my research and I, I listened to your podcast that you did. And it was so funny because it was like, he said the nicest things and is, it was so flattering. And he said, you know, listen to this girl's voice and you're just like, God talking about these really beautiful things. And then you're like, do Rogan experience sponsored by the flesh.

Speaker 10:         01:22:19       Right. I was like, I was amazing.

Speaker 5:          01:22:23       It was so cool because this was our first podcast we've ever done. And, and since then we've done a couple more, which has been really cool. Um, but you're, you're a podcast champion.

Speaker 10:         01:22:35       You guys cool. You did. Dunkin's Oh my God. Don't give them, wasn't in the shit. Yeah. And he's become one of our friends too, and he's special. We love him. I love the fuck out of that dude. Him and Brian are feuding though. Oh No, I love the fuck out here. The roof. Oh, I love the fuck out of both of them separately. I have two right now. Nobody's taken sides. Will get in the middle of that. No, no, no, no. Split of the rift. Please. You hear like, you're either like shitty things are you like, hey, how dare you? How dare you. How

Speaker 3:          01:23:06       dare you? Oh, apparently I like both. I don't know who is who should. We have an intervention now, so that'll be, that'll be fine. It's really minor detail. I'm only reminded of it when Joe brings it up. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to, I just had to because we were talking about how awesome Dunkin as I feel like I have to staff to say we can't talk too nice about him because Brian and hammer feuding sort of metaphysical way. They're going to get over it eventually. We're going to do ecstasy together and then they'll be fine. They'll hug it out.

Speaker 3:          01:23:40       I'll pass that. So weird sandwich blacked out. I don't even know what like whip cream and hot sauce. I don't know if you know what you want to put those together. That sounds like you could get an infection of cream and hot sauce and I told her you shouldn't put get something chocolate up there. No, you shouldn't keep it natural. No, I have had friends who have done, I think shit gets really messed up from like from like beauty magazines like cosmo. It's like, how to please your man, you know, with all this bullshit of like skirting from what just feels right and you know, being in a relationship or not, or just being sexually confident, but like, you know people that bust out the food part and then rub it on things. You gotta be careful with that. I don't know. Oh, like with sex, if I was getting on some dude and he's like, hold on, I'm going to put some whipped cream on her twinkle. Zam it sounds like really uncomfortable and stickies try it looks a problem. It would just cause problems. You know what I mean? Maybe not though. Maybe. Awesome. Want to just give me a massage, but better yet. Let's just, let's just go to chick fil a and call it a day. Wow. It's either that or the highway. I guess you've made your, you stay in your claim. They'll cream. Put Food on my special place.

Speaker 3:          01:25:13       Yeah. No, no, no chick-fil-a, no food at all. She's baked. That's the, that's the abandonment movies. Go to chick fil a. Let's forget the whole thing. This is plan B. Now. Maybe I'm just a traditional girl. I just like to get down the regular way without food. I agree with you. No need to bring in cherries. Mickey Rourke. You remember that movie? Was it? And what was it? Nine and a half weeks. What was the movie with Mickey Rourke and Kim? Basically one and a half weeks. Is that what it was one of the first movies ever master. Okay. Am I that? I know the name of that. Um, pretty good. Um, yeah, it was a, it's like a real sexual movie and they did a lot of like food stuff and there was like some when Kim based your Wa oh it's hot as fuck. She was so hot back then. It was stupid. And you know, and when her and man one works well, he's

Speaker 6:          01:26:04       like kissing her and their, he's feeding her grapes and shit. Or after he reconstructed his face way before. Well he, you know what happened with him? He started a box. That's right. My bad. I stand corrected. Well, no, he did have some like face work done, but I think some of it really, some of it was a little bit of reconstructive stuff. He got, he got like, he had like real problems apparently. I read in some interview with his get like neurological tests, like the chats on them. They was like, you have to stop boxing like you're, you're having like brain issues. So he had to stop. But I mean the guy went from crazy, went from being a fucking huge movie star to being a boxer to back to being a movie star yet. Like that's a weird bond and professionally and fighting the deal guys.

Speaker 6:          01:26:48       He was a boxing real people. I mean they weren't, they didn't set them up with like some of the best guys in the world, but they set them up with some good fighters. Like he fought some boxers. That's another backup of honey. Honey doesn't work out. It's either the brothel in Nevada or boxing. People are always like, because foot soak like Wilson, he's a fucking actor. He's a goddamn movie star. He fought real people. It was a real food. You also wanted a box. It's not like he's out there fighting sugar ray Leonard or something. Okay. It's like what a crazy Guy Mickey Rourke was. That's a wild ass mood. Did he win any bounce or anything? Yeah. Yeah I did. Well I think you won so many law. I don't really remember his record. I mean I remember watching him box wants them so it was a real fight.

Speaker 6:          01:27:28       You know, he's really fucking boxing. Some guy went from being a movie star to being a fucking boxer. He's getting punched in the face and shit. You little whoa. This is legit. I mean again, it wasn't fighting. The best guys they do really was fighting. Yeah. He must have been like a heavyweight. Yeah, I met him at a, one of the UFC. He's a, he's probably a pretty big guy. He looks like he's in really good shape. He got, he got really big for that. Um, that wrestler movie. He did. Remember that movie? What do you guys got in there? They are looking for getting crazy. I'm feeling a little warm. Do you want a water? I'm good. I'm good. I'm sticking with my eco vessel. What does that well too to sort of reduce on the plastic pollution. Right, but it's got a little filter in it and we take, I take it on the road with me so I could drink river water out of this thing.

Speaker 6:          01:28:17       I know I'm, wow. I think we're going to go full circle and then we'll come back to deer skins. I'm down. You going to be glad. When I get my food with a bow and Arrow ladder, I watched those shows. I watch those shows on like the outdoorsman channel. It's a shoot pigs of the bone deadwood. It's like this is, that's, that's where we, that's those are our ancestors. Well, it's weird when you shit went down. That was how everybody had to live just a couple of hundred years ago. There's no other options. This is what, this is the way it was. That's it. Go out and kill animals. Have you ever gone hunting Joe? No. I'm going soon though. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. I used to go fishing a lot. What type of delicate form of going hunting for deer. Really check this out. This is kind of fucked up. Uh, Los Angeles just banned

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       all marijuana dispensaries. Shit. So true. How did they just posted this? How has that Po, is that, wait, where are you reading that? It says the Los Angeles City Council. It has just voted to ban all medical marijuana dispensaries. Council member Paul Cortez was the only person to vote against the ban. Um, this exemptions will allow patients to continue growing marijuana for their own use and primary caregivers may continue to distribute the drug. So don't worry about the cancer patients. They'll be fine as cities, physicians to find a dealer.

Speaker 7:          01:29:39       Um, so this is just within the city of Los Angeles. I, I'm not 100% sure right now, but that's Kinda Kinda fucked. That's pretty crazy. I wonder if like that, like the, the, the, the people that like la speed weed that aren't a dispensary, but they can deliver it. It's pointless. Like why, why, why, why is this happening? You know, it's like, give me the logic, show me the numbers. Show me where somebody is getting hurt. Why are any resources being spent in this way so, so silly? Well, I wonder if, um, that's so cray one, is there much government regulation on the dispensary's because you know, as far as like taxation purposes like isn't, I mean California is broke. They could certainly use the money. Perhaps they want to come back with their own spin on things. That's, I don't think that's what's going on. I think, uh, it's, it's one business pushing on another business.

Speaker 7:          01:30:32       There's no, there's no logical reason for them to be trying to go after these people. It doesn't make any sense. It's not like you're trying to protect society, excuse me, protect society from marijuana. I mean there's no, there's no science or numbers to back that up. It doesn't make any sense. Especially while you're selling liquor at the liquor store and the drugs at cvs, it's like to say that you're going to spend any resources to stop marijuana at all those, it's crazy. It's like I don't care if that's been there already. You're showing me something that exists right now and then in a liquor store that's far more dangerous than some marijuana, and you're saying that's okay. Fuck yet is more dangerous to your body. More destructive, more dangerous for social behavior, more dangerous for driving, more dangerous for almost the buzz right now. Don't ruin this for me. I like, I'd like booze, but it's just we, it's nonsense that we would allow them to use any resources to stop pot. It doesn't make any sense. There's no reason why you would go after that when you haven't fixed all the streets. You haven't solved all the murders. You haven't stopped all the crimes. He, why are you raising wasting any resources on this silly issue? This is dumb. We're going to get an interest that have money.

Speaker 7:          01:31:46       Tennessee honey. Oh my goodness. What is that? What did you just put down? Is that Jack Daniels? Jack Daniels. Honey, I think we have chips here, but that'll sound awesome on the microphone. Great. I guess is how we make friends on the Internet.

Speaker 6:          01:32:01       Whoa. What's she? Oh Damn. What is, what is that name again? Test. Is it a Burrito? The rice and you go, I want to eat that and then saying or you want us to say? Probably same first. I should probably say how the recipe you'll be spraying all over this mother fucker. What a lady. Um, I'm supposed to have dinner with my parents. Actually my parents are in town. They came out to see us for Sheryl Crow, which is really, really cool. Awesome. Yeah, they're, they're fine. So, uh, you've been living in this crazy little dream life now. Does it feel like it? Um, it's, uh, it's interesting, you know, like right now I'm like, I'm really tired, really working hard. Like you're constantly drawing, constantly performing. I'm at that point where I'm just like, fuck, like I just want a little bit of slack something.

Speaker 6:          01:32:47       Right. Um, and I think we're close, you know, I think this Kickstarter things going to help us a lot. Um, and Sheryl crow has been amazing. And um, actually Ben and I need to finish writing our third record and we're going to actually spend some time in Nashville, which is a very reasonable, reasonably priced place to live. I've been drinking, but it's a, it's a nice area. Nashville, it's beautiful. It's great. You know what it has, it has all this space. And now I've got Louise, the dog, Ralphie may lives in Nashville. Do you know Ralphie's comedian? I don't. He shares that. He's got a house there in a house here. I thought, oh cool, we should talk to him. We're doing some shows there and stuff like that. But um, you know, everything's been great. I, at the end of the day, I'll be honest with you that, you know, because all these like uncomfortable places we're in, because I'll to speak candidly, Ben and I are without places of our own right to live.

Speaker 6:          01:33:38       So we like crashed with friends and that gets hard after a while because you just feel like an asshole all the time. But it's so old school rock and roll. No. Well, yes and no, but, but you know, I am. Yes. You need that chapter in the movie. You're right. You're absolutely right. Um, and I, I do have appreciation for it and I, I feel really good, you know, even when I'm tired and all that stuff. But the coolest part is that I, I feel really good about the tunes are writing and, and just the, the shows we've been playing because there, there is this like element of like that's like the place where I am the happiest. Do you know what I mean? Like to be right now as far as this is when you're creative, why don't we, yeah. When I'm, when we're playing, you know, when we're on the stage, cause it's like, it's this great experience and there's a lot of things happening, um, up there that like make it, it's like, oh yeah, that's why we're sleeping on couches. It amazing. That was really good. You know,

Speaker 8:          01:34:28       your life narrowed down to such a focus, you know what I mean? Right. Because everything is going into this, these like this 45 minutes every day on stage were out for two months, for 45 minutes, you know, like five times a week. So it'd be, it becomes this like focal point of everything, which is like, I don't know, that's an exciting feeling I guess.

Speaker 6:          01:34:47       Oh yeah. Yeah. I share it with a standup comedy. It's a very similar sort of a intense moment that you prepare for all the time. Yeah. You know?

Speaker 7:          01:34:58       Yeah. It's, it's so, so weird. Things performing. You know, I've always just tried to describe it, like, just be step outside of civilization and look at what's really going on. What is really going on when you're performing well at some weird energy exchange. It's like you're, you're giving them these things that you thought up, this creativity that you've worked on and honed and you're showing them this and it's entertaining and they feel good. They feel good when they listen to your song, they feel good. When you play a great song and you hit a note, literally the person's body feels different. Yeah. And that's what happens when you do comedy as well. When you, when someone's on stage and they're killing, and I'm, I'm watching it on my holding my sides laughing. My body's feels different. My body's like tingling with laughter. Like if Joey Diaz, she starts still even don't even know Joey Diaz. You gotta meet Joey Dance. I know the name. I know you guys talk about him. Funniest human being. I've ever met in my life. You'll just, you'll be in the role. He just to break things down for you cock sucker. It'll just tell you he's, he's just crazy old Cuban dude. He's the baddest motherfucker ever. But he makes me laugh so hard that my body feels different.

Speaker 7:          01:36:05       Bodies like tingling, hilarity, you know, that's, that's uh, that's why we're so addicted to it. We're so addicted to this weird energy exchange, you know? No,

Speaker 5:          01:36:14       I really want to talk about this thing that happened for our first Sheryl crow show. You know, in relation to what you're saying. And like, um, we played in this theater in Santa Rosa, California and it, it was sold out. There's like about 1500 people and it was indoors. Um, and a lot of times when you play theaters, you know, everybody sits for the opening band. So there's, it's, it's kind of an awkward, like, you feel like, oh fuck. Like nobody's getting up when there's like a more sort of upbeat song and you're just like, it's quiet. You could hear a pin drop, which is good, but it's like totally nerve wracking. But we had this thing, this really great show. Um, and at the, at the end of the show, um, you know, everybody, and this was the second time this has happened and we've been a band for a long time and the second time we, we felt this way in a theater and it was sort of somebody else's show, you know, were the opening band.

Speaker 5:          01:37:04       It's not our show there. They're there to see Sheryl crow. Right? And we're fortunately, you know, fortunate enough to be there to get some attention. And we had this incredible standing ovation and they put the lights on the people and you could see just this, all these people like, and they were glowing and it just like, it was like this, like it was like a wave crashing over you. But like it like a good way of just like people being like, yeah, all right, we like you, we accept you. And it was so intense that like my, I was, I, you know, my, my eyes were kind of crying and I was so embarrassed because I didn't want to like look like an idiot, but it was so like physically my body was like accepting all this warmth from all these strangers and it was, it was amazing. It was so great. Yeah, it's a trippy feeling. It really is. A similar thing happened at Coachella. I felt like there was people so excited to

Speaker 8:          01:37:56       be there at Coachella. It's this crazy experience and then you're in this place in the middle of the desert and everyone's just so pumped up to see whatever happens in the first moment in our set where like a big beat dropped. Like in the, the second song, which is Gosh, there was this like eruption from the crowd and everyone just gave you this huge burst of energy and I felt less self, you know, you have to like

Speaker 6:          01:38:19       mom's breath for real. It's the weirdest thing. When I was a kid, I remember I would listen to like kiss live and when you listen to a live album, it was always like a little off. They were like a little faster. Like the song was like a little faster. It's like something I'm not always, but sometimes and I was like, I wonder what that is. Why it sounds well it's because they're fucking jazzed up with adrenaline. I mean, what, what's, what's it been like to be kissed? You imagine just standing on stage being an ace freely in 1975 fireworks are going off in your guitars. It's the fucking places going Shit House. 28,000 people screaming at the top of their lungs and they're painted. Yeah, I mean we should start painting your face. I was a kid during the, the, the first big wave of, of kiss and then I, I couldn't imagine what it would be like to play music like that in front of that many people.

Speaker 6:          01:39:09       Of course he'd be playing a fast. Yeah, that was a fanatical following the kiss army. I still have a kiss army tee shirt. Oh, it's a, it's a weird thing playing for a large volume of people. Most of you guys have played for 10,000 people. We were in, we were in Chicago. This is a duo to, as a duo, is it just the two of us? And actually at one point within our set, the power went out in the middle of a song and it's like, that would be like, Oh God, I just peed myself on stage and everyone can see it. Well then you just go step that. No, it's way better though to do that then the P or cell phones too. Right? You're absolutely right. You're totally right yourself on stage. Just like, dude, you're fucking, you are on your own now. Nobody wants to hear anything you have to say now. No one's going to take any of these days. Seriously. He just pissed your parents dude. And it's so rude. Really, because we bought, knocks the wind out of you, you know, to be in front all those people. But anyway, not to get off of the stage pants paying thing cause that's fun. But, um, yeah, that was the most we'd ever played for and that was a real people. Holy Shit. That's a lot of people. Whew.

Speaker 8:          01:40:16       For sure. We're opening for Sheryl Crow. This is the thing called the Chicago folk roots festival. This is just this festival we played a couple of summers ago and there's just this huge field and we'd get up there. It's just the two of us kind of thing. That's beautiful man. Yeah. Oh cool. Is that, that must be such a trip. What does that feel like? Well, when you get the energy back, when there's this surge of anyone telling you, it's just like, I felt it all through my body and I had to like slow down literally within the song from just like,

Speaker 6:          01:40:45       oop. You know? You know what though? I see myself with that energy. It's like you have this incredible experience, um, when you're, you know, you're in point a and the audiences in point B and then you kind of have to like, you have to leave it there once you leave the stage because if you take all that energy with you, like that's how you want to go, like stick a needle in your arm sometimes or like do something crazy. Like I'd be like, I feel like that energy is his not mine. You know what I mean? Like I have to leave it on the stage. I really appreciate it when I'm there, but I had this, I had a real moment of, of revelation, um, from one of our first or second tours I can, I'm getting a little crazy, but I, I met like, I had like my, my palm read this, like this woman told me that she's like, you, you need to, you need to protect yourself and when you leave the stage you need to leave the stage and then have yourself as a separate entity because otherwise it'll like swallow you up.

Speaker 6:          01:41:45       And I believe that to be true. I think that if I were to take all the attention that I got on the stage as a personal definition, I think that's, that's a, that's troublesome for my person because I, you know, I'm there if I, if I just live my life, like I do my job and I have, you know, my musical abilities and gifts and that's, that's one thing. And then that's my job and then my passion and then then these other parts of myself, like my family and my friends and my dog and my new dog. So I know what you're saying. Like, look, that's just very apartment. Ally's it's very wise to try to separate yourself and hence your ego. Yeah. Cause it's dangerous. It can be come self indulgent and that's what everyone's terrified of. Everyone's terrified of becoming that a really ridiculous, like a overbearing star singer person.

Speaker 6:          01:42:35       You know what I mean? Like someone is just completely out of control. A diva, someone's screaming and yelling at people, someone who's nuts. It doesn't appreciate like every, every minute of the ride. Right. You realize how fortunate they are. I mean that's, that's what any artist is terrified it becoming that person, that disillusioned dis dis disconnected person. That's the worst thing that could be, you know, you cannot be creative. People who are in that position have, it's, it's not, uh, out of maliciousness. Is that a lack of awareness? You just losing touch. It's, it's been really great to see Sheryl Crow because she is truly an amazing woman and, and is humbled and so successful yet so grounded. And she's got, she's got her kids with her on the road and the like this incredible crew around her of people that they've been helping us, which is, you know, sometimes it's the opening band. You're not, you're, you're the freshmen, so no one's gonna like help the freshmen. But, but that's a great example. You know what I mean? It's like a bitch with all due respect to totally respectful. But it is, it is, as you said, you know, your ego can, could just be like this atom bomb within such a great thing and you don't want that. That's how the avoid that when you, I really firmly believe that when you get really crazy like that, it hinders you creativity. It's like you're not gonna have anything

Speaker 7:          01:43:52       else to say. You're not going to have any other places to go to because you're in like some words sort of a psychic prison. I know you'd trapped herself in this weird world of not looking at things realistically or I or idealistically, you've trapped yourself in this world of negative, you know, in your, your, your country

Speaker 10:         01:44:06       and the universe doesn't like tough love that word. Beautiful Man. I'm so glad we didn't make a drinking game out of it cause I'd be more drunk than I already am and I'm really thinking about it. I'm pretty hamster right now. You know, I got this one

Speaker 7:          01:44:19       writing program that I use on my computer and it won't learn con

Speaker 10:         01:44:23       awesome. You can make up a word you get. It'll learn everything else and learn shadow. Correct. Every learn. Fuck it. It gets to con want go for the right click and it's like, nope, I won't even let you fucking, I'm like you little bitch. But it'll let you add conti. Ah, Jesus, this is good. This pot thing is freaking me out. 764 tax stream revenue streams are just being cut. Here's the news. If you want to look at what happens, here's The p after you. That's how it grows. Like medical marijuana license dog shit, go on. Welcome back. The medical marijuana is legal in California, but some say the dispensary's bring crime and a nuisance to their neighborhoods. Let's go live to Doug coke in downtown La were boisterous, appalled with these robots. Supporters of the bad robot. People that robot ladies go to the robot guy who and Jessica has, you know it's a very heated topic and it doesn't look like a decision. May come time and come down anytime soon. City Council right now behind closed doors in a closed session discussing the legalities surrounding the possibility of closing hundreds of medical marijuana facilities around the Los Angeles.

Speaker 12:         01:45:32       We are out of control with it. At this point. We need to come up with something that's going to work some of the police department could live with the committee can live with because we get continuing complaints. If only it were that easy. City Council set to vote Tuesday on whether to make la pop dispensary's illegal before members make that decision. They hear public comment from both sides. Those who depend on medicinal marijuana for health is that tool shit pot dispensaries or getting out of control. It's even LAPD stance. Pop clinics attract crime counsel trying to find a solution for both the crime as part whether that means tighter enforcement, limiting the number of dispensaries or allowing a certain amount of caregivers to grow marijuana under their own conditions. Whatever decision is made today, it won't be made without heavy debate. I believe in the medicinal value of marijuana. What we want to do is ban dispensaries that are not allowed under state law. I have friends that are still alive today because of medical marijuana and that's why this is so important to me.

Speaker 4:          01:46:37       Okay, let's keep it down. Pause down

Speaker 10:         01:46:47       now. Before they went into that close, I had the chance to speak

Speaker 12:         01:46:50       with district five member Paul Koretz and he tells me he has no clue, uh, when a decision will come down today, if in fact a decision does come down today, he also tells me he has no clue which way it's going to go. As matter of fact, you've been telling me it could end in a seven, it's seven vote in which then they'll have to figure out what's going to happen. Reporting live from City Hall. Doug Coke Ktlk five news.

Speaker 2:          01:47:10       Well unfortunately it did happen. Fortina Oban Wow. So I it really sucks because I don't know if, I wonder if you'll be able to still deliver it cause if, if you can get it delivered that, that'd be different. If they, if they just want to close it down to have stores cause the neighborhoods and crime, that's one thing. But if you could have it delivered like pizza, cause that's still, I believe legal. So it would just ban a storefront. Yeah, the store front. So I, I believe like, you know, we, uh, were friends with this company called La speed weed, which you, it's a delivery service and it's, I think the Las largest one. And I wonder if now if that's the next thing, like you're going to see these delivery like pizza delivery trucks going down the street everywhere, making more traffic, stoner traffic. Uh, it's kind of like what New York is like, isn't it? Yeah. I don't think there's much more uh, delivery. Yeah. Delivery based because they don't have this master. Is that yeah. Do that. They don't, they don't. They don't. I think so. I'm wondering, well, if it's just la county like it, that means I wonder if that means if the valley, like, you know, like

Speaker 6:          01:48:24       these people aren't even potheads Brian, they don't care. Look at the both of them. They don't care. They get go dispensary. You wouldn't even panic. No Way. If someone said no more whiskey for you, I'd be like, Ha, I dead body. But that's not what they're saying. They're saying no more pie. Like, I'm cool with that. Like I already went down a dark road once accidentally, Daniels distillery and stuck up for the rest of eternity. I don't know what to do with that pot. Especially for writing. I really don't know what I do. You be real productive. Favorite Shit. Yeah. Well can we? Yeah, I'm super productive. See it's funny. Everything affects everybody differently. I bitch when I am high. I bet it's the rock a bit. You get in the wrong shit. I, you know, I don't know. I've tried all the different things the best.

Speaker 6:          01:49:10       I think, you know, vessel has been a spliff for me because it's just a little bit and I like, I like tobacco, like cigarettes. So you know, you could smoke a cigarette if you want one. I'm good. Actually I haven't smoked it a couple of weeks cause when I'm touring I try to fucking keep worrying. Worry about that with your voice thing. Yeah, absolutely. So I don't smoke like I used to, but I, when I do like I really fucking enjoy a cigarette but I don't smoke all the time. That's an Internet meme right there. What you just said is going to be an Internet meme. So me, a photo of you saying I don't smoke, but if I do it's going to be a cigarette.

Speaker 6:          01:49:44       Is that what I said? Oh, what a winner. Oh Great. Don't encourage you rarely smoke. Like I really enjoy it when I do. It's like, you know, cause like I'm a singer. That's stupid. What I'm saying. I mean you have that crazy gift. Well thank you. But I mean, I, you know, I used to smoke a lot and then I became aware of how much of a hazard that was to my, my career, my moneymaker pleasure you can produce by making noise with your mouth. Think about that. That's really, that's what your career, not really, man. My mouth is very important. Yeah, but that's just the response. It's no, no, no, no. You, when you do it, it's totally different because when you're singing, it's a completely different experience. The actual harmony of the words of the sound you're making with your mouth. Why don't harmonize with themselves, whatever the fuck it is.

Speaker 6:          01:50:41       W the harmony of it. Is it just about, am I saying the right thing? Whatever it is, the whole awesome miss of it. Okay. I cranium with your mouth. You're creating with your mouth. That's amazing. You know like when, when the, the, the part of that video that I loved when you guys were on the roof, it was like just the first, the first verse, like when the first few words of your mouth, he's like, he'd go, Whoa, that's a crazy noise she can make with our mouth. It sounds bad ass, you know, because it's like I have a weird laugh. Whatever it is, it's, it's, it's the sound of it and then it's more than that. It's the idea expressed in the words and then even crazier your energy and interpretation. It could be whatever fucking pent up shit you have. It doesn't even have to have anything to do with the lyrics, but it goes through those lyrics and comes out in the song.

Speaker 6:          01:51:31       And when someone sings with like real emotion and real passion, it's like a creepy feeling. It's like you almost feel like you shouldn't be allowed to be watching this. It's like they really, you really like, especially you two guys on that rooftop because or wherever the fuck you were because there was a tap was a rooftop, but because there was no one else, it wasn't, it wasn't like it was a crowd. It wasn't like there was, you know, synthesizers are in it. You know what I'm saying? It's just you guys on the rooftop there. So God damn sweet Joe. I'm just being really nice and we appreciate it. Well listen, you guys are the shit. Play some music. Can I a question? I hope so. Can I request La River? Fuck. Can't do it. Give us a sec. You've got to have to, can we start off with something else? A warmer? Yeah, yeah, sure, sure, sure, sure. I just love that song. Oh, that's so funny. I'm sorry. I should have a rude, I forget. I'm an idiot. Like I told you, I don't know anything about music. I mean, you would have to actually have the right stuff and I'm like, make the noise that make that song sound so good. Come on and make that noise with your mouth. Mechanical devices. How do you know when on

Speaker 1:          01:52:46       when you're tuning it, you just know about your hearing it we use machines, these machines to tune things. Was it old school and the old school way? Was it? Um, was it, I think they still buy electronic tuners eighties. Oh really? Yeah. And it, and it changed things a lot man, because all of a sudden you have this precision. That's right. Which is good. And also, I mean it's like kind of analog to digital. Who's your favorite guitarist ever? And this guy named Django Reinhardt. Oh, you're one of those obscure indie dude's. I see what you're doing there. Also, Jimi Hendrix. Awesome. I loved it. That's why I named this teacher Rogan experience. I totally jacked Jimmy. Jimmy, I have no less than 15 Jimi Hendrix tee shirts.

Speaker 1:          01:53:32       Brian Bohm. Gary Gary Clark Jr. Yeah. Why don't I know that name? Yeah, he's a musician in New York. Uh, Austin. Austin. You got to check him. Yeah, he's, he uh, is a black gentleman and he says like this bluesy rock. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Somebody recommended him. I radically enough. I don't think it's ironically but recommended. Sorry. Sorry, please. They recommended a him on a thread about you guys, which is even more fascinating. And my message boards, I think they brought it up last time they were on the farm. Did you? I don't remember. That's what Brian's here. God point mother fucker. So he's um, what does his, what does his, um, his, his CD or as record or release or whatever you would call it. Not as digital release.

Speaker 1:          01:54:22       Is that what you call them? What do you call them? Like when you guys put d, Say, hey, we put out a new Erp, recode. Recode. You still say yes, they'll say record, right? No fucking excuses. Push House honey, honey. And I'm from Cleveland. I hope they can keep that whole English accent thing going. I hope the world in this age of information and distribution of information doesn't match nice. I hope they don't become Americanized. Like send them too many movies and break their will. They'll just going to realize, but it's a better way to talk. The Americans have a better way to talk. Let's be honest. Fucking might just join them. We'll just lead with the ego. Lead with ego. We're America and we're not content. That's my a new logo for what everyone in 2016 it's a we're America and we're not convinced. That's our philosophy. So anything that we do as Americans that would make us look like cuts we automatically can't do. Cause we've said we're not cutting. So now he can't be starting any wars. If you're, if you're not a client, you know he can't be robbing anybody. Can't be spying on you citizens unless you're a should be. We're America and we're not

Speaker 10:         01:55:44       tons. I like that 2016 that's going to make it work. [inaudible] vice president assassination proof. That's right. Nobody wants to kill me. Let Brian be president. Get your helmets on. Yeah, right. We'll turn the White House and into a mother fucking strip club. Imagine if you could like make Molly legal, like if you became the even making weed legal and you're just like, I'm really bummed out Angeles too. I can't believe that happened. So is this a happy song? You should really know Brian. You're right. You should be bummed out. It's really disgusting. It's disgusting. I mean it's just, it's nonsense. What did we do here? It's not, I would sort of happen recorded, but this is called [inaudible]. [inaudible]. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. You want it? Okay. Hold on.

Speaker 4:          01:56:55       Ah, no. Bushmaster from it. I can't take it

Speaker 9:          01:57:27       to make me change my mind. Then you got to show me. You Good Sam. Ooh, you got on him? He get mad.

Speaker 4:          01:57:52       Oh, ah. Oh wait.

Speaker 9:          01:58:24       I seen that door should deep in your, when you always cut me down on the kitchen. Oh.

Speaker 3:          01:58:42       Oh. Is that how you get

Speaker 9:          01:58:49       ma'am? Maybe. I don't know of,

Speaker 13:         01:59:41       Oh,

Speaker 3:          02:00:29       Holy Shit. You guys are awesome string. I might be the only one we can play. Daddy's got some more history to my this. That was amazing. That was incredible. That's the water. It's a great, great, guys are so fucking talented. It's stupid. Oh, you back? You guys are really fucking good. It's Kinda creepy. Kind of creep me out, man. I'm not sure like it is that how, how did that song that you guys have, that sucks. What was the name of that song again? It's called numb. Numb it. And what, how did that come about? It came about from, um, let's see. Um, probably something to do about deck. [inaudible] in a tough place and you just don't want to, if I can look the other way. He liked our whiskey. Young lady. Don't you know I do dare you. Nothing. Nothing at all. It's a gift to the universe. Just like your beloved devil's

Speaker 5:          02:01:39       lettuce.

Speaker 10:         02:01:40       Awesome. It was marijuana like the whiskey too. I think I'm to become an alcoholic now that I can't go to the store. We should all just start drinking more. Yeah. Well that's what they want.

Speaker 1:          02:01:51       Yeah. It's the whole thing is just so fucking stupid that they're trying to suppress it in any way, shape or form. That's not to serve or protect. Cut Shit. It's stupid. It's dumb. Making no sense. Leave us alone.

Speaker 5:          02:02:03       Is that official? I wasn't paying attention

Speaker 10:         02:02:05       laws. Too many laws set. Don't need to have that many. 700 plus a dispensary is all at, where did he just shut down immediately? So fucking stupid. And these, some of these places, these are like mom and pop places. Like I know there's one place and they make their living like how the hell we're getting suppressed, ladies and gentlemen, the streets are going to fire. You know what? She should be filled with smoke. Maybe six and beanbag. Ooh, I'm saying,

Speaker 1:          02:02:41       um, often. Do you guys want to, I wanted to ask you earlier, how often do you guys sit down together and try to write like, it seems like you're so hectic, you're constantly going from town.

Speaker 5:          02:02:49       No, late lately it's been, um, we probably have written once in the past week, but you know, after, after the Sheryl crow dates, we were going to be on a schedule where we're writing every day just to get the next record out. So

Speaker 1:          02:03:02       yeah, it's super hard for me if I'm on the road just for like a weekend, I couldn't imagine doing it for like five and 600 constantly going from town to town and they're trying to squeeze in some writing. It's got to be really hard to put yourself in a place. I mean, I don't know how you guys, right. How do you, do you, um, do you have like a, an idea first or do you jam, do you, how do you guys, right.

Speaker 5:          02:03:21       Everything, we don't really have look up, I'm chewing on ice cubes.

Speaker 10:         02:03:26       Oh, that's very cool. Like Carmen idea, someone comes in with part of the song and then if that, so like art isn't good enough, you know, for the other person to be excited, then we just try to finish it.

Speaker 1:          02:03:36       So, um, you know, like you'll like be driving in your car or something and you'll just have an idea and you write it down and put it in your iPhone or something. And then you guys,

Speaker 5:          02:03:43       every once in a while you'll get this like whitening of the, you'll write a whole song in a day be like this, you know, waterfall of words. And they were like, fuck yeah. And then sometimes you really got to chip away at songs and some of our better songs, I feel like we've really been, we've chipped away at and they've started as one thing and then bend this completely different, you know, product by the end. Right. You know that like the best part, I mean not the best part but I just, I guess you just have to like let it be what it is and we try to be diligent about it to write consistently. Even if it sucks. It's like let's just do it. You know, you have to exercise this muscle. Um, but you know, the more you do that, the more you kind of get to that place. You want to be out and writing with Ben, we've been writing partners for years now and never have any other writers. We have, we have, but it's, it's so different. It's like we, he and I have the shorthand, you know what I mean? Like we of your stuff written by

Speaker 7:          02:04:38       Youtube. Yes. It's a very interesting collaborative process cause you know, you're both very unique and yet you're both, you know, very good and you got to figure out how to do it together and like this weird sort of a spiral that works your ideas and his ideas. And that's fascinating to me cause like a lot of people, they don't do it that way. Right. Like one guy will be the one who writes it or make the music or something. Yeah, you guys do it all together. That's bad ass. Yeah. That's a cool relationship. You guys are like, like almost like brothers and sisters, like tied together for life, you know, brothers and sisters on earth. In music. We're a Siamese twins by the fingernail. Yup. Something crazy. It says John Hodge. Fascinating. It's a fascinating relationship. You know that you and and it works so well.

Speaker 10:         02:09:47       Yeah. Boy, that was a beautiful song. That was a beautiful song. I love that song. It's so creepy to, Oh, you got skinned knees, you're looking for bodies. The water's black. There's a lot creepy shit. Jumping fences. Los Angeles. Fuck yeah, it is, but it's cool. You know, I love the, I love new, my new home park. It was on his TV, so really cool. Yeah, it's called brothers and sisters is on this. Okay. And there's like this wedding weddings and then these beautiful romance, these people holding hands and then he thought it's how body in the weeds coming up. They just like, they weren't listening to him. Well, maybe they were trying to be ironic. Maybe they were like fake hipsters. It didn't really understand it, so they're trying to use your music in a fucking nefarious

Speaker 1:          02:10:34       way. Yeah, that's what it was. That word in the Ferris wheel, it's almost as good as a foot, a foot like that. Serious. You can use it in there. There may be some fuckery of foot. That's a very, also a good word is as good as it gets. Yeah. I happened, I stopped using that one and it was restarted by my friend Steve Maxwell, who was talking about like fake martial arts guys. It's like, Hey, there's a lot of fuckery involved. Oh, I love this guy, but that's it. The word, I fucking lost it for a long time. Now it's back fine. You can keep buying it with a foot. You know something you could bring up almost every day if something's wrong. He's just saying, I believe there's some fuckery afoot. Right? I like that. The whole, the whole thing better. How do we, how do we move you guys to the next level of, uh, of, of showbusiness stardom, whatever it is to get your shit out there so you don't have all these financial issues because this shit is annoying me.

Speaker 5:          02:11:28       Well, and it's annoying me that you guys can be good and have any money problems. We reach our Kickstarter goal. That'll help a lot because it'll get us through this next tour. We're going out in October. Let's be totally clear. We're not just asking for money to like sit here and play songs. We have, we have a tour in October with a band called trampled by turtles and they're incredible. They're there. This, uh, uh, their, uh, um, a bluegrass band from Duluth, Minnesota. And um, in order for us to go out with them, we need help. We need financial assistance because we were like, we're at zero. Right? And it doesn't pay enough to even pay for your expenses. No. And to get the merchandise and all that stuff and to pay for a tour manager and a van and gas alone. You know it's really fucking hard.

Speaker 1:          02:12:12       Yeah, it's, you're in a weird situation. It's like you guys are like superstar artists. You like super talented, like your, your music is amazing. But I'm like, how the fuck are you bitches broke? That doesn't make any sense. Really irresponsible areas. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:12:27       Betty spends a lot of money on mod products. Fuck fuck. I love a nice pair of Chinos. Open the sports page. Fuck. He goes into j crew and he spends thousands of dollars

Speaker 1:          02:12:37       do goes off on that. But like I can and smelly bath places at those at the ball. Do I? Yeah. You know, let's put together some people just buy a bunch of shit I'll never use.

Speaker 5:          02:12:49       Oh a bad thought. I'm going to take it. I'll be honest with you, when I was younger and I had it, like when I, when I had a steady job actually when I worked at Baby Blues Selling Barbecue, I made more money selling barbecue than I did with a record deal. I had like sweet cash all the time and I would just buy whatever I wanted. Like I was like, I'd go to nice restaurants all the time with my friends and I by myself, whatever clothing I wanted and, and it's funny, this point in my life, like, you know, Shit's pretty tight, so you got, you got to really like, like unless I need it, you need a sugar daddy? No, I'm not. I'm not that kind of girl. Listen, I that kind of girl. Joe. I know you're not, but let's pretend you were. Don't you pressure me? Let's come up with a fake sugar

Speaker 3:          02:13:32       daddy. Some perfect scenario type like a podcast empire guys. Did you like guys with a Werewolf facial hair? Very here. You need to be able to physically pick me up. That's true. There should be to tire throw football and you're in the desert with a hurt ankle in the desert. The man's got to be able to carry you. You dead. Mm. Yeah, because otherwise you're just going to lay there and die. I hurt my ankle all the time, so I can't carry you. Yeah. What the fuck, you know? Oh Man. Should be able to carry as a woman. [inaudible] surely carrier through the desert and these over the shoulder. Actually I'm style. I really have no idea what I want and we'll find out as time goes on. Oh, we talking for real? You play Oh, red band. Multiyear Ohio. That's my favorite. Yeah, that's a great song.

Speaker 3:          02:14:17       I messed up the lyrics the other night. Oh No, I felt like, what did you, did I fucking freestyle when you saw, um, what's her name? Fuck up the national anthem. What's her name? Christina Aguilera. When you saw that, did you wince like when you like am I see a comedian bomb? I can't even watch. You know what? No, it's, it happens. It's like, well that, that's d no disrespect. I don't want to, I don't want to fucking dog on anybody, but like, but what, like here's the thing, like we hadn't, again, we hadn't slept for a couple of days, like Ben, like exhausted and sometimes sometimes like you get comfortable and then you zone out and then you're like, fuck, fuck, fuck. And then you just, and I did, I freestyle then it made sense and I was like, maybe those lyrics would have been better than the original ones we'd written.

Speaker 3:          02:14:57       It could be any number of things though, right? Cause it was like I'm a get you Sucka Mama said knock you out Ohio today. Was it? We good cause that what you did now what did you do that was like judging me. Go for it. Um, no. I, I literally just started saying worth. No, you didn't say oh no. That's hilarious. You think tough enough. I was just like, Oh God. Oh God. Laughs stuff, stuff, stuff, stuff. Tab Click. Thank God I can screw up on the guitar now and I get terrible. No one notice. Yeah. When you're talking about it in front of a million people, but they don't know. They don't even know who we are. They're like, there's a girl with, with hair and on her head and she's got a banjo. That's all they saw.

Speaker 8:          02:15:45       Okay. This is a crazy thing about show crow though too, is that she goes up there and she, she has this brain tumor. She's a brain tumor right now. Is it a city have to be operated? It's benign, but she's, she forgets stuff so she has um, what it's true. She owns up to it. That's the thing. She goes up there and she's like, if she forgets a word, she says I got a brain tumor. But the fact that she goes up on stage, um, with the knowledge that she could forget the lyrics are not knowing. I think that takes a huge amount of lady balls. Lady lady balls hitting. Yes, it definitely does. Yeah. It's just an amazing thing. 80 bucks does turn you on, Brian.

Speaker 6:          02:16:30       Let's talk about that. What else are you feeling ladies? Triangles. Nags, nags, cut off. I started drinking. Awesome. You did good for you. Did you have some of the hunting JD? No, I had a fake captain. Morgan's staff. That, is that the stuff that you said you were going to drink? Oh, that's what I was talking about. I didn't know what that means. I've never heard of this. Delicious hammered the last time we were on your show. It was a great time. We had a great time too. Okay, good. A manager just emailed us. I thought he's going to be like step acting like idiots. Why would you ever listen to anybody? Don't ever listen to anybody tells you. Definitely can't get it right you guys, you know what you're doing. Just trust your instincts. Go with the flow and use the force. Luke, we're gonna finish this bottle of booze and go streaking down Pasadena.

Speaker 6:          02:17:36       That's who you really want to do. But if you do it, it means that you really wanted to do it. And then she just fucking do it. I don't think I've ever gone streaking good then. Don't do it. If it doesn't feel like that's what you should be doing. There's some crazy bitch and wants to take off her clothes and run down the street. What's wrong with that? I say nothing. Keep my boots on. You know, as long as you're not hurt, I don't know. That's a good mood and you should probably just one screen. So naked with that sounds so dangerous. Hey Joe, can I hit that joint? Um, I don't know where it is. Oh, you think we should be higher for listening to his songs? I want to talk about the crazy dude. A crazy dude. What are you talking about? I really, I can I read an email?

Speaker 6:          02:18:21       Yes, please. Wait a minute. Are you sure you want to do this? I am. No, you were talking about crazy encounters with people. This is fun to me. This is really funny. The other day when we had our epic show I was telling you about in, um, in Santa Rosa, California, there was a gentleman that was front and center and he was really enthusiastic to say the least and was so, so very complimentary and genuine at the end of the show. And he had said, hey, I would love it if you guys came and played a show at my house one day. And originally we were like, it's kind of weird, you know, people say that you're like, you know, okay, well that's, that's a nice sentiment, but we want to be careful with situations like that. And then, then the guy's like, I can, you know, you'd be playing after Steve Miller, Steve Miller band. And he's like, he's like, you know, I can, I can afford to pay you. And basically saying, let them that he's got, you know, some, some muon and he can, he can pay us. Right. So then, so then he gets a little weird. Oh and

Speaker 5:          02:19:29       Oh God, where is it? I kind of got to blow up this guy's spot. No, no, I'm not naming any names, but um, it, it got really, Ben, do you have it? There it is. Oh No. Did he respond? Okay. So, so he, he was a little Kooky, like he was dancing around the front of the stage and um, um, then he sends, he talked to our management and our manager was like, this could be really great for you guys. And then he sent an email to our manager and it goes like this, Jeff, about honey honey and the lead singer. She really needs some help with the tire starting with her boots. She can be one really knocked out gal if she dressed right as she might have noticed. I'm covered with women. So that is not my interest. Her talent is about the lead guitars. That would be been his humility on stage is a great plus about the drummer. He should be shown new licks from some of the greats as he has the potential to be one himself about eight for the date that he wanted us to play the bubble if you have any. Anyway, so he had this big fucking spiel about my boots being a problem and I think my boots are fine.

Speaker 6:          02:20:33       Really. Are you really addressing those? I mean they smell a little more problems. More problems [inaudible] right. Thank you for calling us out about your shoes. It's our fault we let him in. We were hopeful. I was literally planning on playing a show by myself cause Ben couldn't make it and then he told me that I wasn't cool because I'm going to it better crazy people antenna and I said, you're not cool because it's pretty obvious with this dude. This guy was great. He writes in the front row. Well then you should said totally hold though. He owed us. Well it sounds like a rich douche bag. There's a lot of those out there. It's normal. You calling us out cause you're right. We should, we should move on from anyone that hates so silly. What does he give a fuck? What you're dressed like? That's what you'd like to dress. I think that's what pisses me off. It's like you're an idiot. You can't, you can't influence. Like you can't say, oh you know you should be in stilettos and with your fucking toes.

Speaker 6:          02:21:33       Just to prove a point where only boots should wear what you want to wear. Red Lizard suit, non creative people always feel like they can fix things. Like they could step in and fix like little, you just see me and he needs a fucking haircut. This car because it's like your problem is the problem isn't the just distribution of music. This young man with his crazy hair girl needs to lose weight. No one needs anything. Look at that. A Dell check. I mean it's just all you need is a sound. You need the amazing sound from your voice. People fucking love you. Look at Amy Winehouse cracked out to the end. All fucked up. Missing teeth. Amazing voice. Everybody loved her. She didn't look good. She looked crazy. She looks a lot better now. Shut. Cut. Shut up. Right for at least 15 minutes. You asshole. You son of a bitch. Um, at least like three to four years off your life from Karma. She was so interesting because it was like retro but not, you know, like that Rehab Song. What a beautiful song man. She had an incredible voice

Speaker 8:          02:22:44       but that seems, sorry, I was just going to say I was, I was watching her live last night. It was just thinking about how, you know, you see a lot of groups that are successful kind of redoing an old sound and even if they do a great, it's, it's, you know, it can be great, but she kinda contemporize it. She did something completely different. Yeah. That's amazing.

Speaker 6:          02:23:03       So much like we were talking about earlier about like emotions, like traveling through the lyrics and it doesn't even matter what you're singing about if like that the, the emotion in your mind, you know, comes through the words. There's like this weird effect that a song has and with her, like she totally nailed that man that I remember seeing that Rehab video where she's sort of swaying on that microphone while she's saying it. You're like, God damn, that bitch has got some talent. You know, she just had this weird new thing, new thing, next level. Oh Yeah, look at this new thing. Crazy voice talking about she's not going to go to rehab. She's thinking about not going to rehab. Yeah. By that I mean that was the truthful, you know, what's kind of sort of like heartbreaking and beautiful about it at the same time as that, that was like, that wasn't somebody being like, Hey, let me write a pop song that everybody's going to want to buy and listen to and sounds really trendy right now.

Speaker 6:          02:23:55       That wasn't some sort of generic kind of regurgitation of what's already been done. That was, that was somebody being honest in, you know, it's, uh, it's very interesting and powerful because that woman, um, if I think if, if you were to look really closely, didn't, didn't really care too much about the other side of like the attention. I think she just really wanted to be loved and she was an artist, you know, and cause, you know, she, she talks a lot about heartbreak or talked and, um, there, there's a really interesting thing that, um, I think about a lot. I saw this really sad youtube video of, um, when she kind of got carried off stage, she was playing in Serbia, and this is about a week before she died. She'd started a tour and she came out and was like, hello, Athens. And she's in Serbia. And, um, it's like clearly inebriated on, you know, beyond belief and falling over, can't, can't sing. And um, you know, it's an interesting thing to think about the fact that no one put her into some sort of facility immediately upon that circumstance alone. But you know, when you think about all of her art, it was like, people were like, yeah, I love the song as a club hit. It was a radio hit, single number one billboard, everything. And then if you really don't look closely, it's like that was, is that the Ah, Shit,

Speaker 3:          02:25:24       you know? Um, it's like that was real. Um, and you know not to, to bring it down low. Yeah. I think that's a show. Um, yeah, she starts taking her shoes off and shit. Oh yeah, I saw this. And you know, it's just like some, somebody just take her home. She's got a rob bad mixture. Yeah. Give her a cup of coffee, get it back out. So Redman, say something funny, little slap on the ass, you know, look, um, do you, do you see that shit and then you see it as like, well, you know, there's the pitfalls of a fame. Avoid these roadblocks or do you ever think that that could ever happen to you? You could become Super Amy Winehouse style famous, really solid family. I got a really great foundation from Ohio stock or Italian. They're actually here. I'm actually late for dinner, but yeah, there's my folks and my, I've got three sisters and some really incredible friends and, and Ben, you know, and you guys are going to keep it together no matter what.

Speaker 3:          02:26:22       Even if you get Jz type famous, don't you become a crack head on my watch? If you guys have a giant all like yacht and dancing girls on the yacht and I come visit you and I'll be, I'll be meditating time, we'll have all the fucking naked chicks and all the booze, but we'll be like zen and meditating on our juice cleanses and shit. Don't think the girl supposed to be naked. That makes it a little classless. They're free to do whatever they want though. We're not going to stop. We won't stop them from going topless if they don't want 10 lines. Translucent, undergarments, translucent undergo. Let's not fucking discriminate here. Do you remember when that Tan Lines Brian, remember that she member Tan lines when Tan lines were hot? Huh? 10 lines are still hot under the playboy bunny.

Speaker 3:          02:27:15       Never did that. Never do that. Good for you. But a lot of girls in high school, I did good for them to expressing them. You know what sucks about burned yesterday cause I was walking outside without Brian. What sucks about spray tanning? Because your bed looks like Garfield died in it. It's like an orange streak in your, what do you think's going to happen once they have the ability to actually physically altered the way you look? Because they're working on that now. Like they're working on all sorts of different, no, no. Genetic engineering change. People's genomes change. Whatever that is. The DNA change, whatever the fuck they gonna be able to change. But they're gonna be able to do something where they could turn black like a gorilla. That'd be cool to be black like a every Friday, like black Friday wouldn't be the, you keep changing back and forth.

Speaker 3:          02:28:22       Imagine if he tried to keep changing it back and forth. Your Dna just kept going more and more fucked up. You like, I want to try to be an old man for one day just to see what it's going to be like. Oh Benjamin button on their asses. Yeah, I do that. It's called October. Twice. What? Justin October. Moving on. Yeah, we've lost ourselves there. I know. Where are you going to take mommy? You're going to go to the olive garden. Oh, let me tell you something. Even know what just happened. Come on. They don't got trolled. This is, he does it. He mentions all of garden, a verbal trial. He even mentions the olive garden banks. It's cute. He sneaks on my family. My family owns an Italian restaurant. Did it's like son of a bitch. 40 years. Yeah, my grandparents started so they rate the off garden.

Speaker 3:          02:29:10       Well they don't hate the olive garden, but it's like, that's like saying um hey guys, thanks for coming to California. Let's go to, let's go to Mcdonald's. Yeah, but they can appreciate the value. You know, you're saving their daughter some money cause I'm going to have endless breadsticks there. Red Van, red van. Once again, you're put back in timeout. Okay. Fellow Ohio stock. I know, that's why I'm saying let's stick with the local businesses. Oh, he's a camel. He's from a different part of my castle.

Speaker 1:          02:38:04       They're fucking savages.

Speaker 1:          02:38:09       So the crowd was so crazy to 20 dudes got kicked out for being hammered and heckling. And at the end of the show I get a standing ovation and when everybody stands up, one guy pulls his dick out and starts a on the people in front of them. Yes. And there's a video of people punching him in the face. This is a video of that guy getting punched in the face. It's on my Twitter feed from a couple of, couple of days ago. It was awesome. Calgary, you people with a shit even just look 20 Douche bags out of a crowd to crowds of 2000 people. It's fucking great numbers. People are going, I'm sorry. Those people ruined your time at Calgary. Nobody ruined anything. I had a great fucking time. It was amazing. Calgary was the shit and the guys who got kicked out, you know, they just got too drunk. The intermission was a terrible idea to, there's an information. Anyway, so it was over. We'll see you guys smile. You're not your calling.

Speaker 4:          02:39:10       Okay. Yeah.
