Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Jamie,

Speaker 2:          00:00:02       you.

Speaker 1:          00:00:11       Oh Philip the Franco. Alright, I'm good man. It's cracking. I'm good. Although all the conversation we had right before to be the good stuff and then all of this could be two hours of bad. Yeah. We shit on some movies and got, got mad about Republicans and talking and then we gotten mad about Democrats. And you're putting. You're putting away in an I statement. Yep. That was us. I was just, I was just being your therapist man. Thanks dude. Sweet. So sweet of you. Isn't that what a podcast is? Just like, let me, let me hear what you're saying, but then let me, let me talk about the world in a way. Yeah. Is that a phone? That's a tiny little tiny one man. But you get the little tiny iphone. Yeah. This is. This is for my daily example of why I need to be patient.

Speaker 1:          00:00:51       I had an iphone six plus the biggest storage I was. I was really happy with it and I was like, man, I need to get that iphone seven. And the only one they had was the small one with the smallest storage and it's, it's a piece of garbage, you know? I know. Well just because I'm like, you know, I don't need that much storage, I'll use the cloud, but I don't because I don't trust the cloud. So I cared of all those Dick Pics, getting all the Dick pics kegs of them. I think that's the good thing about not being extraordinary in any way. I'm not doing that. Like you don't have to worry about your dirt. No one needs to see it. So you just ran out of, what is it like a 32 gigabyte or something? Yeah. No, it's like I have to. I'm like, which memory will I delete before I make.

Speaker 1:          00:01:31       It makes me be a little bit selective, but I don't know. In this day and age of stupid, does it bother you that it's small? Not as much, but you get used to it, right? What do you have? Yeah, I have the seven plus man. Do you use that? When you look at websites in particular where you don't have to expand the screen to get the entire thing, you don't have to go back and forth to get the entire article and there's little tricks that people don't know where it's like you just double tap, not pushing, but double tap and like all that shit that's on the top of the screen that comes down for you [inaudible]. They just use it for people with tiny hands. Oh yeah, that's right. Yeah. The if you double tap the home button, right. This stuff, that stuff they made for people that just aren't.

Speaker 1:          00:02:10       They don't fit like the standard and you just, you just use them and then fucking buzzfeed calls it life hacks. Then like 10 things you didn't know, like let's go, let's get 7 million people's office. Some basic shit there. There was that one phone that they had. I guess it was the iphone four that had the sharper edges on the side. It was very narrow. That's the perfect size phone for texting. You think so? Yeah. It just fits in your hand. Perfect. Like it locks in place. Like I can text with one hand with this thing, but

Speaker 1:          00:02:39       not that easy. It's a little slippery. You just got to switch to get like that swipey keyboard. Oh No, no, no, no. I've seen people do that. Bryan county that did it makes you angry? No, it doesn't make me angry, but my friend Brian Cowen was trying to show me how good it was. Like, look, look, look, I right. I just go from here to here and he fucked it up a few times. I'm like, go fuck off. Just to just from this five minutes of before and after. It's like I hate swipey keyboards and movies where kids have cancer to things I won't stand for. They're pulling on your heartstrings and if they show you cancer and a kid has cancer, like right away, like, look, you could have made me sad in a less brutal way. So are you okay? If in the trailer they let you know the kid has cancer, fucking stupid.

Speaker 1:          00:03:23       I see what they're doing. It's like kid out of here and you were talking about arrival. I didn't even watch the movie. I watched the movie for three minutes, the girl had cancer and I'm like, fuck you, and I hung it up. I'm going to sleep. I'm not going to watch this. He's going to want to go on this depressing journey right before bed. It's going to get me fucked up. Dreams, so uninterested in depressing movies. I know. I've read the news. I watch television. I pay attention to internet videos from all over the world of depressing shit. I know it's real. I think the moment I had my first kid, I was like, okay, this is. This is my realization that at any point I could have the most damaging pain in the world, so I get that I don't need. I don't need to be depressed and reminded of that at every moment. [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          00:04:08       That's what I'm constantly thinking about when I'm not having a happy moment. I'm like, how? How could the world completely fuck up my whole being? Yeah. I'm more interested in funny things these days or really stupid horror movies. Is that just escapism from the insanity that we're dealing with? Yeah, that's all it is. It's all escapism. I mean, even game of thrones or House of cards, which is like about politics. So total escapism. These are not real people. Yeah. But I, that's what I ended up finding is I end up rooting for people that normally wouldn't root for it. Right. So in house of cards, I'm totally rooting for them and breaking bad. Even the final season when he's doing all that fucked up stuff, I'm like, yeah, well too white. I'm with you man. I didn't watch the final season. I didn't get that far. But uh, I'm in the middle of a season three right now of house of cards and yeah, Kevin Spacey's goddamned murderer.

Speaker 1:          00:05:02       I'm trying to remember if third, if the third season is kind of like the man season before, because last season the last season was amazing. What is it like how they have five out for is for? So three I think was kind of just felt like a setup season. I'm and through them, man. I'm fucking cooking through them. Watching a four or five a week. Yeah. I mean, if you, if you haven't started that episode one of season two, that's where I was like, okay, I'm in this is because I feel like you always have to have that one episode where you don't know what's gonna happen where you're like, okay, I'm on, I'm on fucking shaky ground. This isn't something that I'm going to watch while I'm cooking dinner and not really paying attention and not miss anything out. Right. That's like, that's like scandal. You're like, okay, they're going to go on some like fucking eight minute monologue where it's like you can't do blah, blah blah, blah, blah. And then he was like, what happened? Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever bullshit. Well, escapism is. I mean it's fun. It's. But after awhile you just run it. It runs its course. I think just absorbing media, just taking

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       in too much. After a while you just get extremely jaded. You know, like I've seen people that are tweeting about things online and you go, God, that guy's fucking jaded man. Like people are so jaded. And they realized like the amount of information, the amount of data that people are getting on a daily basis, it's just you're not designed for this. Yeah, no one's designed have unlimited options for entertainment viewing at your disposal on demand all the time.

Speaker 1:          00:06:25       If you ever want to like a quick reminder of how add and how true that is. Just look at your fucking not you specifically, but your own twitter history. I'll go from talking about something like that.

Speaker 3:          00:06:36       Deeply political and I'm like this fucking craziness to like did you see tonight's episode? And there's like a difference of five minutes. Exactly. Everything's always

Speaker 1:          00:06:44       happening and I just, I don't get it. I'm critical of it, but

Speaker 3:          00:06:49       I'm part of it, you know, well we're, we're, we're definitely changing in our attention span is changing and probably not for the better. And we're, we're, we're accustomed to things being quick and rapid. Like here's a perfect example. The way you guys edit your videos. You don't have any pauses. You're not human in your video. That is because I got like a c minus in public speaking. Everybody does it. Everybody on Youtube does it. They all do that thing where they take out all the ums and pauses and they go from one thing to level a little bit, a little bit, a little, a little, a little, a little bit because it is, it is

Speaker 1:          00:07:22       battle of attention and battle of eyes. But I think that I think people are seeing more and more, especially even the youtube, the Youtube Algorithm podcast, I think that there is 100 percent always going to be an audience for longer form things. Uh, my video is started out as it was even in the little intro sequence. It started out as three to four minutes. Let me talk about the world for three or four minutes. My videos now are 10 to 18 minutes every day. Granted a lot more is happening every day and they're like this, this new new presidency and, and stuff like that. But there is an audience that wants more. And so you had the vine guys, but even, I mean finds dead now. But those guys have now launched into longer form pieces where some of it is three to four and then some are daily, 10 to 18 minute pieces, so I think there's always going to be an audience. People are tuning in longer, more than ever because the Internet was tuned in for for six seconds, 15 seconds, one minute, three to four, and it's just getting longer and longer,

Speaker 3:          00:08:19       but it's not even just the longer longer. Even if you do a three minute thing, you're still going to edit out all those little tiny gaps in between sentences. Yeah. What's that about?

Speaker 1:          00:08:27       It's just getting out as much. If I didn't, if I. If I stopped cutting out my pause, my video is five minutes longer. It'd be. It'd be a nightmare. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Because my video is I don't, I don't script. I'm not reading from everyone else or from something. Someone else wrote A. I do all my own research. It's me taking all the information and then just going on this, this word soup rambly thing for for five minutes to make a three minute piece. Do you like you take in too much data because you're doing all this, you have, you have to have to have the main difference between, I think the last time I came on here, which was about two years ago and now is back then I was, I was Kinda scared to share my opinion, right? So I would just, I would kind of reputation of reddit stories that popped up and things that popped up on websites of like distinct happened.

Speaker 1:          00:09:19       Anyway, here's the next thing that happened. So you're more of an aggregator of things that have happened like I was then and now it's more of because no one trusts anything, right? Where we talk about right wing or left wing people being in their own bubbles and you know, we go in like I know I know the truth, but you might not because you're just sticking to the stuff that, that, that you believe in. And then you see something from an outside source and go, well that's bullshit. That's not buzzfeed. Right. Well and, and that's, and that's the problem. I mean, buzzfeed really, in my opinion, fuck themselves with the way that they released those documents. I couldn't be completely confirmed right with the whole, like trump and the, uh, the prostitutes peeing on the bed stuff and they're like, we can't, we can't confirm it and neither can any of the other places that have gotten this information can't confirm it.

Speaker 1:          00:10:05       But there is this piece of paper that says that it may have happened. What's even worse is all of these mainstream news sources. We're doing it. We're all releasing this story, the salacious details on the story of Donald Trump and the Russian prostitutes, water sports. Like, what the Fuck Outta here. Just a way it read. I immediately called bullshit. I'm like, do you really think that he has people pee on him? People pee on the bed and he wants them to pee on the bed and he watches like, fuck off. So that's the problem, right? Is that's not even the actual thing that the story was, but that's what it turned into the whole story. And ended up being. Or like we're supposed to be that Barack Obama and Michelle Obama stayed in a hotel room. Right. He hated them so much that he hired to come and pee on the bed, not on him.

Speaker 1:          00:10:51       Right. And so that. But yeah, but then everyone made it like, Oh, he likes pee on his face. And it was like. And it became this example of, as long as it's hilarious enough, I forget who said it, as long as it's hilarious and enough people will just roll with it. But it's so hack. It's not even hilarious. And it's like, that's like what a hack premise writer would write. Like if you want to write a hack story, a hack scene in a movie, but a crazy person. He hires all these ogres baby. Come on, pee on Daddy. You know, it's like, it's so stupid. I feel like if you, if you heard that though and you were like, oh, it's like a coke fueled businessman from the eighties. He be like, yeah, that probably happened, but not in today's world. Well, not only that, you don't think Donald Trump would check his hotel room for cameras.

Speaker 1:          00:11:32       Oh really? Do you don't think that a multibillionaire who's kind of a freak would go into that thing and have someone scrubbed the room and may have some expert? Yeah, man, he's probably super paranoid. He's fucked over so many people. Maybe that's why we don't see the tax returns. He's paying all these people off. Exactly. The tax return thing is real. Does that bother you? So yes, I know that bothers a lot of people. Well, it should. I think, you know what? I think it's, it's, it's easy to argue that, you know, well, people aren't going to be able to understand it, but I also know so where people are going to go, well it's going to be misconstrued, but it's, it's, it's a, it's a, it's an honest question. You heard that argument? Yes. That's going to be. Taxes are going to be misconstrued.

Speaker 1:          00:12:13       Yeah. They're gonna. They're gonna take the smallest things and they're going to on TV and the media does at times and they're gonna. They're gonna. Expand on it and make it this crazy thing. The same example with the urination story. All of a sudden I looked at facebook, all my real story, right? But it started out as a core thing. Right? But he plays for this and then it turned into Donald trump likes getting peed on. I understand what you're saying, but the problem is the taxes are an actual real thing. 100 tax returns. It's very clear and concise, right? I mean, so they're going to say, well look at this money. It could have been all these things and then it's not. It could be. It is, right? That's an argument. It's not one that I agree with, but I would prefer to actually see because I am a big fan of like get as much information out as possible so that we can actually break shit down.

Speaker 1:          00:12:58       Well, every single president has done it, right. That's what's so unprecedented about it. And he has multiple business ties apparently with Russia and he owes a shitload of money to China. Like those things are massive factors and he has these business ventures that he has an all these countries all over the world. What's really crazy is his son's running his business now. Right? So his sons are getting flown around with secret service details all on the country's dime. He spending more money on travel in seven months and Obama did in eight years. That's the projection. If things go really? Yes. Okay. I'd have to. I'd have to look at the numbers so you can find it, Jamie, because that's for me, that's like New York Times. I'm pretty sure because that's. For me, that's, that's the whole premise of my show now is you're making that argument of why we should.

Speaker 1:          00:13:47       I then on my show mentioned that argument. I then go into the argument of how it could be misconstrued and then I separately give my opinion, which I personally believe that we should get the tax, but it's not even an opinion thing. It's law. He supposed to release his tax returns. That's what your supposed to do, but don't you remember there's the whole audit audit which will go on to the end of time and none of it makes any sense. I mean how long does the audit last year? Who's auditing it? Right. And then the hard thing is the story. There's like eight stories every day. Um, I feel like because I haven't seen Kellyanne Conway on TV as much lately, it's, it's less of the case and there was even, it felt like two days were Donald Trump didn't tweet, which was unprecedented. Uh, but it's, it's overloading your [inaudible] there.

Speaker 1:          00:14:31       There are a lot of people that will ask me why didn't you cover a certain story? And it's just, I am one guy making at that time a 16 minute show that I'm trying to explain things properly. So how am I going to, how am I going to get a point? Get across all the points? Yeah. Look at this in Forbes, trump's family cost his trips to costco taxpayers nearly as much in a month as Obama's in a whole year. Yeah, it's, it's the whole thing is very bizarre. And what's really crazy is he was very critical of Obama President Barack Obama's vacation. It's costing tax payers millions of dollars. Unbelievable. What about you? Hey man, but he's going to be. You have to think about the net. You're going to save all that money from all the fewer regulations. Right? Something, something we're not saving any money from, fewer regulations, we're going to have to clean all those ducks that get covered in oil.

Speaker 1:          00:15:21       The whole thing is so fucked, fucked. It's hard. I mean, but even like you're throwing out your opinions now and I think that it's important to have those people, but I think it's also then important to take the time to look into where the Fox News, the Breitbarts, the Donald, the, all those places where they're coming from as far as where their opinions come from because I don't think so. Salon.com. Rolfing didn't post. I mean we've got to echo chambers on the left and on the right and it's the sound of the both of them is definitely to the point where you can't make out what the fuck is going on. Right. And I think that's why it's important to look at both so you can kind of fucking like Shimmy it through a filter and see where these sources are coming from. Gold looking for gold man.

Speaker 1:          00:16:02       Looking for the fucking truth. Because who knows what the fuck it is. It doesn't, it doesn't. It doesn't exist for people, right? It's reality. I mean, it's been a conversation of like reality doesn't matter, right? It's all about perception. That is, that is more true than ever today, right? Because people believe people believe in their right or left wing thing like they believe in God, right? It's, it's, it's not just a fact to them, it's not just opinion, it is ingrained belief and it's. And it's just me trying not to close the door on anyone so that I can always try and have someone's ear. Right. So people can think that. What do you mean by that? So depending on the video. Right. So yesterday I talked about it personally, is that you're saying, okay, yes, yes. So yesterday I talked about, uh, the police officer or the off duty cop and Anaheim.

Speaker 1:          00:16:50       Oh, I saw that. I was crazy. It was crazy. And my whole thing was playing it for people that don't know what we're talking about. Okay. So there's some stuff that we don't see. There's two arguments. Uh, there is one that, uh, the off duty cop will, we'll go through his story first. He said that these kids were walking on his, uh, his property walk through his property. Maybe they're cutting through. Um, he said something to the girl. The boy says that you called her a contract. I said, that's not appropriate. Um, and he says, uh, the child's didn't say that. He said that he was willing to shoot the off duty cop. He said, I'm going to shoot you. The boy says no. I said, I'm going to sue you, but the cop says he's going to detain the kid until the police arrive because you threatened an off duty police officer.

Speaker 1:          00:17:33       Right? That then turns into this. This kid he like pushes the police officer, another kid, a different cable. So that happens at first. Uh, the kid that's being detained pushes the police. Uh, the off duty cop into a bush. Then two minutes past, uh, they slowly get closer to this hedge. Um, another, another kid puts hands on the off duty cop, another kid. Then shoulder checks the cop over the hedge. Then the kid who originally did that touch them. God, it'd be so much easier to have the video. Then one of the other kids who would put hands on him, punched the cop, another kid jumped over the hedge and they kind of surrounded him. And at that point, uh, the cop pulled out a gun, um, and everyone kind of ran away and then it looks like the cops trying to pull the kid over the hedge while holding the gun, it goes off.

Speaker 1:          00:18:20       And then two kids arrested. He's not right. And it's a crazy video. And so we're talking about a story like that that, that becomes a little different than just talking about politics because it's seeing something not knowing fully how it started. Right? So you're having to take the word of to people without having the evidence and trying to get across the point. My pain, my main points in the video, um, I don't like that. The cop didn't seem to deescalate the situation, didn't continually announced that he was a police officer, didn't announce that he was denouncing it at all. So there's this point in the video where a kid I believe says, I don't believe you're a cop or how do I know you're a cop or something like that. Um, there's two different videos, so it seems like maybe he announced it, but if I was him, right, this is hindsight, of course I'd be constantly announcing that I am an off duty police officer and I'm detaining this kid until the police show up rather than potentially just some stranger grabbing a child and also, um, I don't agree. Or I, if I was in his position and all of a sudden I started being attacked, I would 100 percent have pulled the gun out, but I wouldn't have fired it because they were already running away. And I think that is

Speaker 4:          00:19:25       attacking him because the way he was handling the situation.

Speaker 1:          00:19:28       Totally. And that's, that's a hard thing of I have my personal opinion in these segmented areas. I think he could have done way more to deescalate the situation. Um, I think that when he pulled out the gun, he had a choice to either fix his hands so that he didn't accidentally shoot a gun around children. Why does he have a round chambered? Right? Why is the safety not on? Those are important questions, right? So you have to, especially someone that has a concealed weapon, someone that's an off duty cop, you have to hold them to a higher standard. My argument there though is if I was in that same position, I would have 100 percent as I was being attacked, especially if I have a weapon on me that all of a sudden I'm going to get worried that maybe it could be used against me as these kids are already attacked me. I would pull it out, but then he takes it to a different right level

Speaker 4:          00:20:11       where even the way he pulled it out, he pulled it out slow and sloppy, right? Like if I saw someone reaching under their shirt like that for a gun, if I was a crazy person, I would totally attacked him, tackle them 100 percent. If they don't get ahold of that gun, then they're not armed. As soon as they get ahold of that gun, there aren't. Right. I mean, if he's doing all this jazz and reaching in and it's taken so much time, that's all the time you can punch him in the face like this. He's not going to stop you from punching in. The face of it is reaching and grabbing his guns slow and sloppy. It took a long time because he was doing it with one hand, lifting up his shirt was trying to get the gun. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       I think he was posturing a lot of ways to like letting the. Oh Yeah, oh yeah, look at this. Look at ditch dare has been garden. Now what the the press conference afterwards. It feels very much like they're. They're getting their, their ducks in a row before they really come down on them of course, but a cop is just a person so there's going to be great cops and there's going to be morons and there's going to be people that just didn't realize the situation was going to get to where it got to and they just didn't handle all the steps along the way and that's probably what happened with him. He probably thought he was going to say, Hey, stop coming through my lawn and making noise. You will fucks, you know, and the kids like, fuck you, I'll shoot you. And he's like, Oh really?

Speaker 1:          00:21:26       Motherfuck Aroma Cup, you don't believe me? God dammit, look at this. This is my fucking. But so like talking about that story, it's trying to take in both sides of the argument and then separately giving my opinion and I did an event last night and a kid said, you know, what do you, what do you say to people that disagree with you there? Especially from the Latino community, right? Where things like how a cop is going to treat me is going to be different than how they treat us, and I said, I think it's 100 percent fine for you to have a disagreement. Tell me. Talk to me. Don't, don't look at my opinion and go, this is a fucking asshole. I hate this fucking guy. Michael trade talks about in the special where he had he went through like a weird thing to try and educate me.

Speaker 1:          00:22:05       Give me your point of view and that's why it's okay for people to go like he. He tried to give both both sides. He gave his opinion. Who? Who is he though? Were you saying? Just people. People out. People that watch my show, right? Because I have far left far right. People that watch, they don't always agree, but they know that I'm always going into it with the best of intentions and I'm not going to hide facts and I'm not gonna Hide my opinion and I think that's important. Yeah. Well, when you're seeing a video like that, you're not seeing what had transpired before. It got to the point where he's holding onto that kid. Right? So who knows who was a dick. He didn't handle it well, but you don't expect the kids to him well because your fucking kids. No kid handles anything.

Speaker 1:          00:22:46       Well, what name me a 10 year old kid who deals with things. Well, you know, they didn't. They're just trying things out there, experimenting. They really don't know how to communicate properly. I think the number one thing people in their 20 to says I was such a stupid kid and then then, then you go to the thirties and I was uh, when I was 20, I was such a fucking idiot. Yeah. And it just keeps going. You hope that you're growing. Yeah. When I was 30 I was retarded GRANDPA. No, I'm telling you. Didn't you see that Salon Dot com article? You can say that. You can definitely still say it. I remember we talked about that last time I called. I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't try and take back that word. I just want to be able to say I just wanna be able to say kill yourself.

Speaker 1:          00:23:24       Just get you definitely saw that. Yeah, and because we say, well, what about mental health? And I'm like, I'm not talking about it in that avenue. I'm just saying that guy that cut me off, you should kill himself. Dictating should kill himself. Oh, set it. There you go. That's it. That's the only clip they're going to use from this entire podcast. Dick Cheney should kill himself. There's a few people that just like, man, come on. What have you done? What have you done? What have you done? That's ridiculous. Some monsters out there for sure. Just jump off bridges. Wait, what? Oh, that should jump off. Then you think there's too many people I'm sure. And child molesters. Jump off the bridge. There's a lot of priests out there that could definitely run into traffic, but don't. Don't do that because you fuck up somebody's car. Oh my God. Jump off the bridge. Right? Not the worst thing to say, look, just this. This game didn't go so well. Just pull the plug on the console and replug this pitch in and see what happens is. Then you drive it. Flip the board. Just it's over. The game's over. Knock the chess pieces down. Just walk away.

Speaker 1:          00:24:25       There's definitely too many taboo words today, that's for sure. I've been talking about this in my act quite a bit lately because it's just, where's this supposed to convey tent? They're not. They're not supposed to be magic taboo words and half of it is not even about trying to get people to be more considerate or more kind. It's about calling people out on doing something wrong and stopping them. Do you think the intent matters more than the word hundred percent? Because I feel like we saw that a lot with um, there's a, there's two big youtubers that were in the, it was a or one was in the news, there was a cutie pie. Talk about that because I saw his response video and I kinda got sickened. Oh really? By what's happening to him. Oh, by what's happening. I thought you were saying you know his words.

Speaker 1:          00:25:11       Well, he was, he was crazy. It was crazy. The whole thing's insane. They're making it out like he's a Nazi and he's not at all. No. He had made some, some videos where he had told people to not be Nazis and not until like to too. Don't you know, what was his exact words? I don't, I don't want them to this ripping. It originally started with this whole fiverr video that he did. Um, and then fiverr. Yeah. So it's like a website where you can get people to do thing for things originally for $5 now for more money. And so he went through the site. It all started from this one video that got him attention. He went to fiverr and try to get people to do ridiculous, outrageous things. Okay. Good guy dressed as Jesus to say something weird. He got these, uh, the main thing that blew up were these two guys, they're like, they're in like a jungle setting of some sort.

Speaker 1:          00:26:04       They dance, they laugh, they'll hold up a sign, they'll say something. And so he was like, it's going to be hilarious because they're not going to do it right. They're going to be like, thank you. But no. But they actually made a video where the guys were laughing and dancing, held up a sign that said a death to all Jews and then said to subscribe to a youtube channel. Right. The whole of, uh, of, uh, of someone else asked them to say death to all Jews. So he, he wrote in as like a cause in the same video. He gets all these people that are like, I'm not going to do the stupid ridiculous thing that you said. But then they actually did it. The big reason I feel like they did it as they didn't understand what the words they were writing in the words that we're saying, oh, they're from another country. What country

Speaker 4:          00:26:44       were they from? I don't know. I'd have to, I'd have to double check. Okay. So they just essentially wrote down the symbols. They didn't really know how to even say the word. And so there it is. So there it is. Oh yeah. And they're laughing.

Speaker 1:          00:26:54       And so I think this might be from his explanation video, but in the first one he's like, why the fuck did they do it? How do I, can I even include this? And so then that sent, that, got that, got a little traction and then people started going through his other videos and they're like, he's, he's dressed up, he's watching Hitler in this one taken completely out of context of him saying that the Youtube Heroes Program, which was a program where people can highlight videos, are not highlight them but mark them down for deletion because they're offensive. Right? And so people were like, oh, that censorship that's you're talking about like obviously hyperbole. It's like those are Nazis. So he made that joke in that relation. And then there was one, if I want to say if it was on the verge or wired, but then they go even further and they're like, he was Leslie Jones. Picture on Harambie taken completely out of context because he was using, there was this Microsoft Ai Bot, this chat Bot, and you'd say, uh, let me see Harambie as Jesus. And uh, either the AI was messed up or people had manipulated it where it was putting Leslie Jones his face on it. And he was horrified by it. And that was a whole joke, but they were saying that he, he was doing it.

Speaker 4:          00:28:02       So this is clear, like he, you saw him use the software and saw the error.

Speaker 1:          00:28:07       You try and use the bot today. A picture won't come up because now they are aware that that's what was happening. Right. And so they took all these things and it was this like this crusade of, look guys, we're looking at this bad guy. He's the biggest guy on youtube, he's the bad guy. We're going to take them down. So much taken out of context. Some things are not defensible where I can't, I can't say it in the sense of like you say that words don't have power based on intent. And I think there's a, there's a lot of truth in that.

Speaker 4:          00:28:32       Not saying words don't have power based on intent. I'm saying that words should just convey intent. Right? And there are times where a word, there's times where like you see a friend, Nico, what's up bitch, and you know, you in there and you're both laughing and being silly. And then there's times where you call someone a bitch because you think they're being mean. Yeah, I mean those two words exactly the same. But one conveys a completely different intent.

Speaker 1:          00:28:57       Right. But out of this it was, it was very obvious that they were trying to do this takedown thing and it blew up entirely in their face I think

Speaker 4:          00:29:06       because I don't think most people are aware. I mean there was a Wall Street Journal article. All right. Which was where it got really weird because three people worked on this and they combed through hundreds of hours and they found like instances of him holding his arm out like this. And they used that picture. Like there's A. I mean that's, that's weird.

Speaker 1:          00:29:27       Very weird. And then, and then once all that came out that they were like, well, here's the thing about the context. He's just like Donald Trump. And it was, it was an immediate jump to. He's using the same tactic tactics as Donald Trump, but it was just insane. Now

Speaker 4:          00:29:41       he's very reasonable. He did a video response video about it and the way he handled it was very reasonable. And he explained what he was doing and what's going on and you know, he's doing hundreds of hours of him playing video games and talking and being silly and if you comb through those and take these things again out of context and try to make it look like he's a Nazi, that's a hit piece. One hundred percent. And it's deceptive. It's not indicative of his overall. It's hard to call it a body of work, but let's call it a body of work, right? His overall body of performance that's online, whatever you want to call it, right? His talking, it's not who he is. So for them to call him a Nazi and say that pooty pie has seven videos where he's done something about Nazis, like people when they're doing these long form spit ball, improvisation, videos like that, and you're interacting with people, you're going to say all kinds of shit that in the moment is legitimate. But if you chop it up and edit it and splice them all together and then make a five minute montage of him saying Nazi, like he's obsessed with Nazis

Speaker 1:          00:30:47       and what, what kind of sucked from it was a lot of people think that, oh, they're there articles about the downfall of Pewdiepie. I think he's gone up half a million if not more than a million subscribers since all of this happened. Right. So he's gotten all this new support. He's a temporary phase for a, for free speech, free speech and persecution for mainstream media. Didn't even lose some, some get matter for him though. He. So, I mean, it sucks more for the people that we're working on that project. What was the project? So it was scare Pewdie pie season two. It was a youtube red series. Um, so they were, I think there were about to go into production. Um, and, and so then that got canceled. So Youtube didn't want to fund that. And I said it, he said it. He understands why they would have to separate because then it becomes a story of youtube and or Youtube and Disney support an anti Semite. Right, but that's.

Speaker 4:          00:31:33       He's not an anti Semite, so why would they back away?

Speaker 1:          00:31:36       I think because they were scared that the Wall Street Journal was like, did you see all of this? We're going to write this article,

Speaker 4:          00:31:41       Wall Street Journal at that slip through. That seems to me very response.

Speaker 1:          00:31:46       Many of them are standing by it though. Many people, yes. One hundred percent and many are touting it as this victory because he lost a google preferred ads on Youtube, which I will say I don't know how he was still seen as family friendly because I'm not family friendly on my show his past two years at the very least not family friendly and then dropped by maker. He doesn't, he doesn't need his. Uh, his MTN has his company around him and the youtube red series is nothing. He's still gonna make millions of dollars. He's grown. It's a good thing. I feel like now if you, if you have mainstream media, try and take a swing at you. It's some of the best promotion in the world.

Speaker 4:          00:32:21       Why did they take a swing at him and why is anyone saying that they took down a bad guy? I think

Speaker 1:          00:32:26       that it's a big thing of them trying to label and it's, once again, it's a problem with a lot of media is there. They're overextending, right? They all of a sudden start talking about this narrative about outright and the rise of white again in this country. And then they look at this big guy and they're like, we can use him as an example. We can be the heroes that expose this, that do the take down piece. Um, and they're not and they're not. And they're like so driven for that, that they then just, they go, oh, well maybe that doesn't add up there. It's an argument, but we have the power. We have the size of the audience were good and it just blew up in their face.

Speaker 4:          00:33:00       So they were thinking they could get away with it even though it wasn't kosher. I believe so too. What is their response so far? Do, do you know? Have you read anything about it?

Speaker 1:          00:33:10       Right as far as like fans or Wall Street Journal posts, posts, digging their heels in, and then a lot of people started trying to find as always turned on like the authors in the past one was like a joke from 2015 because and, and while part of me would go, well that's petty. If the argument is that context doesn't matter, then fine then then look at these guys, what they said a year ago, look at what they are saying now look, the writers who have the article like I think Ben Fritz was one of the art. The writer is where you made A. I can't, I didn't, I never knew that Jews were so good at frying joke from way back. And then he made another joke about, it was like a back and forth with someone where he said, these racial jokes are so stupid. And then someone said, Eh, you know, they hit everyone. And he said, well, at least the black jokes are funny. Those ones, those ones are funny. Um, and so people were like, well, if, if, if context doesn't matter, are you a scumbag? And then people just dismissed it as are a lot of mainstream people dismissed it as like, oh, that's not the same thing.

Speaker 4:          00:34:10       How could anyone say context doesn't matter. That's insane. That is an insane thing to say. Is that literally what they said, that context does not matter.

Speaker 1:          00:34:18       What was it? It was one of the. One of the people I'm going to get the problem is so many people have written about it. There was one article that was promoted and it said all these are articles or all these people defending Felix with, but context. That's a bullshit argument and that's insane if you think that that's. So everything exists in a, in a, in a highly edited bubble,

Speaker 4:          00:34:38       dope, ruined everyone's career. If you're talking about a mathematician discussing algorithms, yes, context doesn't really mean that much because he's talking about numbers, but we're not talking about numbers, talking about words. We're talking about the way people express themselves and we're talking about someone who is generally considered to be humorous. I mean pooty Pie, a lot of his stuff is playful and humorous, so if your humerus and you're playing around and you say something that might be, I don't even want to use the appropriate, it might be the thing for him to say in that moment to try to be entertaining. Right. That does not mean he's a Nazi and two to label him like that is incredibly irresponsible and it's. It's really bad. I mean, I'm not a lawyer, but I would sue the fuck out of him if I was him. I would sue the fuck out of them for sure. Yeah. Because what they're doing is misrepresenting who he is as a human being and even if it's beneficial in the long run, it's super dangerous to set that precedent.

Speaker 1:          00:35:35       Well, especially in this climate where you say, this is what he supports and it 100 percent isn't. How do you know someone doesn't just see those articles, doesn't see as defense and tries to kill the guy, but why

Speaker 4:          00:35:46       Wall Street Journal do something like this? Now, this is where the conspiratorially minded start thinking, this pooty pie kid is this youtube sensation, much like this Philip Defranco guy. Oh, I mean I have 5 million subscribers. This guy has like $53, million, whatever. That's still a lot. It's a lot. But do you feel, and you're, you know, you have a legitimate viewpoint on this. Do you feel like there is some sort of resentment or anger or. I'm so people that are working against the folks that are, have become these new media stars because I mean, you essentially mean, correct me if I'm wrong, but you kind of run your own thing, right?

Speaker 1:          00:36:29       For the most part, I am part of a company right now. Yeah. That was a financial decision that you made along the way once you became successful doing it in a year. I'll be back on my own and uh, and we're going to get threats. This is where I start the negotiations. No, and in a year because if I, because I want to start my own larger news organization of people that are from the left and from the Ryan can debate like one of my favorite play, a character. I want to wear a fake nose and a mustache. Just talk shit and make things up and lie. I want to lie. I want to be like a line news guy. At first I thought muddied the water for. At first I thought you were talking about Gavin, but then you said the life that I was like, man, he's a character man. I funny motherfucker because I originally knew him as a comedian and then I found all the new stuff with or maybe it's not that new, but uh, all his political stuff. I like listening to the [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          00:37:18       not very new at all. He was great the other day. Was it yesterday? How many days ago was that? Yesterday was dominick Cruz two days ago. I do too many podcasts. I know. I was like, I was like, how the fuck is he had on this? Yeah. Neil Tyson. Dominic

Speaker 1:          00:37:33       cruise. My name should not be on any list. Neil degrasse Tyson. I fucking love that. Fuck is mind on.

Speaker 4:          00:37:39       It doesn't make any sense either. He was awesome. That was the Neil degrasse Tyson show. It's basically like I threw a couple of questions, Adam and he just went on these epic mind bending rants in your brain. Oh, I turned it inside out and then just fucking hosed it down with bleach. My brain will never be the same. We can. It was awesome. Scotty. So interesting. He's one of the most fascinating people I've ever talked to him because of his passion for things like the way he described space and astrophysics. It's not just that he's so knowledgeable. It's the intense passionate in which it delivers that information. It's so infectious.

Speaker 1:          00:38:13       Well, that's what separates people is the passion relating everything to to art that way and the lease. It's relatable to everyone.

Speaker 4:          00:38:20       Everyone will. It really is, and there's an art form to the way he does it. I mean, there's so many people. I mean, I'm sure you probably experienced at some point in your life, a boring science teacher, right? We all have. Where you just like, oh my God, it's so boring. I would have thought that as an adult I would be fascinated by sirens so that will be constantly looking at science blogs and reading all these scientific papers and paying attention to every single news release by NASA of new exoplanets that they've discovered.

Speaker 1:          00:38:50       Passionate makes a difference. I was in school, I was way better at math, but I was. I was fascinated with storytelling because I had a really passionate English teacher really, and I sucked at it initially, but really got me into storytelling and, and, and, and the journey and the beauty of a story and I feel like that we need more people like that. People that care rather than just chasing the dollar. Which, hey, no, no, no disrespect for making money. I, I do feel like some people villainize that, but you have to have the passion.

Speaker 4:          00:39:20       Well for sure, but it's the role of the school teacher is such an underappreciated and undervalued and also it's not just undervalued under appreciated, but when done incorrectly, it's so fucking potentially damaging. I mean, you could really screw a kid's head up. I mean, I don't know if anybody. Did any teacher ever say mean shit to you when you were a kid that stung you and stayed with you for years and years afterwards?

Speaker 1:          00:39:48       Um. Oh shoot. Well, I had some, some rough, uh, some, some rough, a Catholic school teachers, but that was like, that was early day, so that was elementary. That was, that was stuff that maybe pushed me more away from the religion. I think later on it was probably my Spanish teacher who was just so disappointed. Anytime I got anything wrong that it just made me scared and made me a. I didn't have any enthusiasm to all of a sudden learn a new language. And so now I'm this. I'm one of these dumb fucks. It only knows one language me to it. Was it a man or a woman? Woman. Did she yell at you? Yes. Maybe she just wanted to fuck down, Bro. You know, I was just trying to just get you vulnerable. The next thing you know, come over my house. I'm going to teach you Spanish.

Speaker 1:          00:40:30       I'm into children that are 170 pounds and five foot tall. You need to roll. Oh, I still can't do that. I'm like, wow, wow, whoa role now. I got a dumb fat tongue. Doesn't work. Really. You can't do it. I'm like, Rah, I sound like a fucking car trying to start up. God Damn White people I know. So just ruining everything now. Wait, so to jump back to, to what you were saying about mainstream, do they have any real bad guy? Yeah. I get scared when everyone talks about stuff in generalities right when I talk about. And I'm guilty of it too, when I talked about like all mainstream media. It's not everyone you know. Um, but there are. I stopped doing interviews with a mainstream outlets several years ago because they made everything about like I would talk about all the really cool ventures that we're going into, how our space is changing things up and it would always be turned into a one comment that maybe was somewhat critical of, let's say like a studio all become about that or if all become about the money.

Speaker 1:          00:41:31       And, and I was like, you just fucking manipulating what I'm saying with this. And so the point is become a. When the Wall Street Journal knocks on Felix's door after they didn't apparently approach him for the original story, and they're like, hey, we want to give you a platform to tell your story. It's like, fuck you. Is that what they're doing now? Yeah. The after the story broke and there were all these people that came to his defense, they came to him. Now I'm not gonna. I think that's what a journalist should do. Talk to the fucking. May Not be different journalists. Well, so I think from what Felix wrote, it was the Wall Street Journal. They left their cards and that's how we knew it was 100 percent of them.

Speaker 3:          00:42:09       But why does someone. I mean what I mean is it different journalists from the Wall Street Journal not the same age to hit. I don't know if it was the same ones. He didn't seek out, hey, we're super sorry. We called you a Nazi in front of millions of people. And we were totally lying. Yeah. But the argument all of a sudden is a why, why should he do an interview with the Wall Street Journal? Maybe because they have a different audience, but he has his own larger platform where he controls the narrative. He's not going to be selectively, but he's not speaking to the people that the Wall Street Journal risperidone him in front of it, but I would assume that they are also covering their ass by going to him and reaching out and giving him a platform. They can say, well, we gave him a chance to respond and the facts remain. He did say those things and they are valid.

Speaker 1:          00:42:50       I think if he was confident enough, you should probably do what I've seen Milo Yiannopoulos during the past where he had someone film at the same time. So

Speaker 3:          00:42:57       did ms dot represent him in some manner? It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter because they've already done it. They've already misrepresented him in the article. If they. If he has someone film his response to that. I don't know. I mean, I mean just if he did something with them, right. If I did film something, I understood what the entire thing just so you can show, but I'm saying it doesn't matter because they've already done the damage, that damaging thing, like how many people who read the first thing or even going to read the second thing, right? It might even be 30 percent. That's 70 percent people and how many people just read the Wall Street Journal and maybe a local paper and our online and aren't hearing all these responses. And they go, oh, you know, they catch their son. Oh, I'm watching pooty pie. Oh, you watched that Nazi, that a Nazi? No, he's not dead. You hate everything I liked

Speaker 1:          00:43:42       and now that kid's doing meth, but the rest of his life. No, I, uh, I, I think that it is sad, right? That's, that's a huge problem with, with a lot of the fake news or just news that's false is the crazy salacious shit. If you then look at the correction, half the time that gets like 20 times the shares, you know why? Because it's fucking insane. It's like, did you see this? Did you see this thing? And it's something that I've been critical of people I like in the industry, a critical level out of the mainstream guys. I don't like it. And it sucks because there's not, there's not a clear answer. Do you delete the false thing? And then it looks like you're hiding that information. Um, do you do, you should definitely delete the false thing. But. So that's my argument. But then there's, there's an argument that you leave it up because you show that you were wrong. If it's on twitter, you quote tweet it, but that's still, that's still doesn't fix it because

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       as much as we talk about bubbles and separation, that tweet, that promotion of a thing is separate from everything else in the world. Tweets are problematic anyway because it's 140 characters and it's very difficult to adequately explained some subjects in hundred 40 characters. But if you put out some information that's not true, like this pooty pie thing, right? You, you absolutely should print a retraction and you absolutely, if you have it still up on your website, the first thing you should say is this is all taken out of context and it's incorrect and it's not. It does not represent who this guy is and you should absolutely not have those writers do that again. Right? I mean, whether you fire them or whether you assignment, who knows what they were asked to do. This is another part of the problem. Was this an independent thing that they decided to pursue on their own?

Speaker 4:          00:45:17       Did someone ask them to do it? Was there someone who decided that this guy was a Nazi because maybe they tuned in at the very moment he was doing something and they're like, make. Some people obviously are very, very sensitive to that kind of stuff, so I think that's why it's important, especially on an editorial team of some sort to have people with with mixed opinions because it's very easy to all of a sudden get railroaded behind an idea of just like, yeah, look at these. Look at these seven specific things. We're not gonna say that it's out of context, but look at this information. We got this guy we got, we got this guy dead to rights, but it's. It's all flimsy. Well, again, context, right? As soon as you have. That is part of the problem with doing something like you do and it's certainly part of the problem with a podcast is if you're talking for three hours and you take these little snippets of those three hours out of context, it paints a completely distorted perception of who the person is, but that's also a problem with language in general.

Speaker 4:          00:46:12       It really is a problem with and it's certainly a problem with words and that's one of the problems with these magic words like that. You're not supposed to say anymore. Whatever those words are there, you, you, you give the weight gives so much weight to these words that just taken a loan on their own. They can get you in trouble. Just saying, uttering the phrase as if it was a magic. Abracadabra. I think it get you in trouble. I think it's important that we stopped trying to got it rhymes and it's not on purpose. We have to stop just blindly hating and we try and educate. Right. I think that don't blindly hate educate an afterschool special star. Oh God. That sounds like straight up. Something from the navy's skateboard. You pull up. Don't hate hate.

Speaker 1:          00:47:01       Educate. Yeah, but I mean if you want to talk about allies, you want to talk about people meeting you. Right. There was. If you turn it into the Trans issue, right. For the longest time I didn't want it ever touch the issue because if I use the wrong pronoun, I was the fucking devil. I was the devil and I was like, just educate me at that time. And this is years ago when at that time I had never met anyone that was trends. I was just a completely new concept to me and, and all of a sudden it was just like I said, he. When I, when I should have said she and it was like I was the worst person in the world and people want it to ruin me and ends, but it's again, what we're talking about before, it's not really what they're doing. What they're doing is trying to find a way to control you and call you a bad person and be angry at you.

Speaker 1:          00:47:49       They could see that it was a mistake or if it wasn't a mistake, you just look. If someone was a heat for 30 fucking years and they became a sheet for a year and you still call him a he, I don't think you're a monster. Okay. I just don't. We knew Bruce Jenner for his entire leg even saying Bruce Jenner. Now you're not supposed to say it anymore. When you go and look at the records for the fucking Olympics, it says Caitlyn Jenner now. Yeah. Well, is that true? Is that real? I'm pretty sure that's true. He's like, wait, one second. I'm go then. I'm pretty sure it's true. Um, but so, so, so, right. So, so I think that's what pushed so many people away. And then the way that I try, because I try and make, I try to make it so no one's the villain in my head so that I can see where they're coming from.

Speaker 1:          00:48:30       I go, well, maybe that person, maybe they're not. Because there are definitely professional victims and cry bullies out there. Maybe there's someone that in their day to day life, someone says, you fucking tranny. Maybe they say all this hateful stuff. No, I know. But then they take it out on the wrong person. Right. I try and see if is this person being attacked so much that then they become this, this accidental monster, which is what has pushed me more towards the center. I went before I came to California. I was an ultra liberal. I, I hope the most liberal ideas of like, yeah, if I. If I'm a doctor and I'm making $3,000,000 a year, I should give 70 percent. Like fucking crazy. Yeah. You were thinking that because you weren't a doctor because I had no fucking money. Fucking money. Poor people always think like that.

Speaker 1:          00:49:11       You want to. You want to slowly come to the center and fucking start a business. Um, but, but so and then being around people everyday, that's 100 percent because you see the problems with many of the arguments. Um, it was, I think also part of the reason I was ultra liberal is there's definitely as you're going up a counterculture thing, and I grew up in the south so it was just like everyone's wrong. And I'm in North Carolina for a while, Florida for a bit. What part of North Carolina? Asheville. Oh, that's like the hip hop part that's is left is a gas. Yeah. But then you go, you go, you go around, you start going out and like, oh yeah, just walk straight and you're eventually going to run into a burning cross. It's like, it's like people in hacky sack and then hate the writer of the quarter.

Speaker 1:          00:49:55       It's an awesome city. That's great. I guess you'd call it town. It's really too small for a city, but I played Asheville a few years back to get back there. That's amazing. There you can go to the fuck was at the biltmore house. They go really small chairs. What does that? It's just like this giant, giant comp. I don't know the history of it, but when I went there I was just like, oh. So people used to be like really short. That's really interesting. They really tiny chairs because that's how people were back then. They were just smaller, shorter people didn't have any food. Man Nourished. If you go back there and give those fuckers some God damn American brief. I forget

Speaker 3:          00:50:27       who I was

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       listening. I was blown away. I also had the same belief that people just died when they were 30.

Speaker 3:          00:50:33       Yeah, it was Chris Ryan, wasn't it? I was looking. Infant mortality fucks up the numbers and that's the thing. It's got to make sure people know that no one's infallible. You know? Everyone can be wrong. Like the. It's one of those numbers that gets incorrectly used. Like the gender wage gap. It's sort of another similar number that gets incorrectly used. People say like women make eighty cents to every dollar a man makes. Not really. They do overall, but it's not the same jobs. It's not like the woman is a doctor and Amanda doctor man makes a dollar. The woman who makes eighty cents. Now it's like the woman is a nurse and the man is a fucking coal miner. It's one of those things. Yeah. See, that's one thing I'd have to dive deep and educate myself on because I'm just like, yes, that sounds legit, but I have to check myself.

Speaker 3:          00:51:18       That's a weird one too. What is this? US Olympic Committee will update Bruce Jenner's hall of fame plaque to say, Caitlin, I saw a headline this morning once I saw a headline this morning that said like, Caitlyn. Caitlyn said something that like this presidencies ridiculous. And I was like, why do we care? We care more on. She's a fucking moron. Why do we care what celebrities? But how about this? Caitlyn Jenner doesn't believe in fucking gay marriage issue. Yes. Gay Marriage. I'm more of a traditional worst. That's what she said. Or more of a traditional last. Uh, you definitely not. Okay. I don't know what, what traditions you're talking about, but anytime any of these places get any of these celebrities, celebrities that have an opinion, I'm like, no, I think the election proof, no one fucking cares. No one cares what these bucket people said. Especially Caitlyn Jenner, like at the end of the day, you don't get a free pass just because you change your gender.

Speaker 3:          00:52:12       You're still judged based on the quality of your thoughts and how you express yourself and if you are a fucking grown adult and you are against gay marriage, but you're also transgender. Your crazy and I know she's buck buckled down for because of some of the pressure that people put on it like Ellen and she kind of like soft into her stance on it, but the bottom line is you're in your fucking sixties and you don't think that men should be able to get married. If they're in love with each other. You're out of your mind or women or anybody just fuck off. It's your stupid. See, I feel like

Speaker 1:          00:52:42       I feel like more and more people when I started hearing about like this, this new kind of Republican I thought it was, and I've seen a lot of people will know. So a lot of people have then talked about, well it's, there's this weird thing where it's like all of a sudden you say new kind of Republican. And they go, oh, so you're talking about white supremacist under a whole different banner. I'm talking about when I was talking about where people that Republicans, I don't give a fuck about gay people getting married and they're like, I'm about, I'm Republican because, you know, small government, right? And, and, and, and jobs. But not like if gay people get married, that's fine. If it's, if it's a moral issue like that, I find myself more liberal and I was, I all of a sudden became kind of excited about all these, these new people that didn't give a fuck.

Speaker 1:          00:53:25       And that was interesting to me. But then when you really see a lot of other stuff that I don't know how to feel about a lot of other stuff that you don't know how I feel about. What do you mean after? I think I had to say it. Don't beat around the bush. No, no. I'm trying to think how to say it because there's these all these fucking different avenues. There's some people that um, they, they'll maybe consider themselves all right because they just love fucking trolling people. Like how do I, how do I trigger someone with some crazy outrageous thing? Right. And it's like I get it. But then there are people then that you can take it a whole different avenue where it's known that, that, that thing, it is now white supremacy that pepe the frog. It is. And to the point where it fucking. Hillary Clinton puts a thing on our website where she's like, this is a white supremacist symbol. That's insane. But what is the frog? Remember? Pepe the frog get there. Like it is 100 percent of whites

Speaker 4:          00:54:11       premise. She put that on her website. Yes. This was because Donald trump people were using that frog to troll online, overextend. You look like an idiot. Okay, but here's. Here's part of the problem when you're talking about people who troll online, go back to when you were a young liberal and you thought that if I was a doctor and I was making $3,000,000 a year, of course I should be given 70 percent in taxes. You don't have that, so you're looking at the people who do and it's part of you is like, give it away, man. You shouldn't. You don't deserve it. Give it away. That same mentality exists with trolls. They don't have anything going on. They're fucking losers for the most part. So what do they want to do? They want to burn it all down. They want the whole thing burned down.

Speaker 4:          00:54:51       Go trump, go try. I want the reason why they want to say go tropos because they want this clearly maniacal person to just throw a fucking monkey wrench into the gears and watched the whole system explode. That's half of what they're doing. They don't have a vested interest in it. They're not. They're not successful. They're not happy, they're not doing well. I think their role is, if you're talking about all trump supporters, I think part of that is true. I'm not talking about all. Okay, okay. Because I was talking about all trump supporters. I'm talking about trolls. Those people with the green frog fucking with the crazy hair on their twitter profile. I mean there's a lot of them that if you go over their twitter feed, their online 13 hours a day, shitting on people. I mean that's some people do. I've gone. I looked at this, a few people that I follow and I don't follow them either.

Speaker 4:          00:55:38       I just go to their pay to have them bookmarked and I'll go to their page like, look at this crazy asshole. What's he been up to today and what they've been up to. Just trolling liberals. Just going crazy and shitting on that. Jake Tapper Guy, boy fucking guy's twitter feed is a mess. Why? Because he, he fucking summon the ire of the trolls. There's a lot of people out there that are disenfranchised and very upset and unhappy and, and just can't wait to burn it down. They just want to burn it all down. They don't have any fucking stake in the game. They want it to burn, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:56:14       but then where, where do we go from that? I need

Speaker 4:          00:56:17       love. Okay, so it's too late. It's too late. They get shitty parents. They live in a shitty neighborhood. Their job sucks. They probably have poor genetics. They're fucked. They got to shit handle life and they're looking at Kate Upton. He's handsome man. He is. He's a closet troll. You don't even know the opposite of a troll. They're looking at Kate Upton and her beautiful tits and they're like, fuck her. Fuck everybody burned down. Why can't I have this? Oh conor Mcgregor's got a limousine. Light them on fire. That's what they're doing. They're mad. They're not happy, they're not successful, and they get to talk. That's a big part of what you have in a society where people are being incredibly mean at every opportunity. When people have the opportunity to troll people are like, did you see like some of the shit that people wrote to patent Oswald after his wife died? No, I didn't see anything crazy vicious mean evil shit. And why do they do that? Because they want to burn it down.

Speaker 1:          00:57:12       The one thing I think it's part of it, part part is going to be that they want to burn it down, but I think it's just also there are a lot of people that don't have the concept of shit that we do online having potentially horrible ramifications in the real world. I think that slowly we're getting closer to that where it's all the fucking same thing and if you do some crazy, outlandish shit, you should know that a ton of people might see it. It's why it's one of my favorite things to screenshot and and, and talk back to a few people that say stupid shit to me online just because it's like you think that you're saying it in this tiny room, but the Internet's fucking everybody in a room. Everyone like what you say has ramifications. Well, not only that, you shouldn't want to say it, so you have to get to the root of the problem.

Speaker 1:          00:57:52       Like, what? Why would someone want to be so evil? Why would someone want to hurt someone's feelings so badly that you're mocking his. I think there are a lot of people that fit just died. So that's, that's a fucking horrible emotional example. But when and why? Right. So what I would say separately from that, if you're talking about trolling liberals or something like that, um, I think that there are people that want to burn the whole thing down. And then I think there are some people that literally they have the mindset that it's just for laughs, right? Well, it's, that's not him. Yeah. And so, and so it's one of those things where I don't know, I don't think was people are inherently evil. I think that especially if you're talking about like a Patton Oswald thing that's incredibly wrong and horrible, but it's like, Mike, my question becomes like, how do I, how do I talk to that person?

Speaker 1:          00:58:38       Right? How do I not a, how do you talk to who? Patton Oswald with trolls, the trolls when you got to go back in time to when the mother was raising them and take them away from the Mama and bring them to a happy person and give them love and lots of hugs. I think people, as long as, as long as you don't automatically call someone the villain, I think that you can get some people, not all of them because some people, like you said, they want to call them the villain when they're a troll, when they're evil. So is that what you mean? Yes. When they're maybe saying something they would see as evil and things when I'm not talking about the patent Oswald situation, because if you go after someone grieving over their wife, you're a fucking horrible monster and hopefully you. You do understand that that has a real world ramifications or not. If you're just an, you might be able to get

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       away with it. He just a little egg, you know, fuck face 69 on twitter and you can get away with it. They'll ban your account, whatever. Ha Ha. Yeah, I got them. I mean, that's what you're doing and trying to get a reaction. It's like you're playing a game. You're right, you're playing operation and when that tweezer hits the sides and like, hi, I saw it. It happened.

Speaker 1:          00:59:43       It was a thing. Yeah, it was a thing, right? Yeah. I don't know. I just, I'm not gonna do it myself. Of course, you know, but I want to, I want to try and talk. I want to talk to people, man. You do. Why don't you like that? You have a show, reach out show like A. it'll be hell for two weeks and then it'll just be. I'll get, I'll end up on one of those fucking Howard stern things where they just have those people that get trolled the entire time. It's like we have another caller. God Damn.

Speaker 4:          01:00:08       It could be windy city heat. You could have a whole movie about it. Yeah. They don't need to know about it. Yeah, I, I just, it's, it's a, a new thing. It's a new thing for human beings. This unbridled communication ability.

Speaker 1:          01:00:21       Yeah, and there's going to. Here's the thing, there's going to be the whole like, let's destroy each other war. I'm just going to try and be the asshole that's in the middle with with leanings here and there that tries to go like, hey, maybe we fucking calm down. That's not the best thing for my career because I would have a far larger audience if I, if I pandered to just one side because I alienated people daily by having left views and then right views.

Speaker 4:          01:00:44       Wait, that's so crazy. You will, you really think that your audience would be bigger if you just picked a side.

Speaker 1:          01:00:50       Yes. Are you kidding me? Like, who? I think that crowd is very favor. Crowder is fantastic. He's very, he's one of the fair guys. Um, but I think he does a great job. You have a bigger audience in, you know, oh, bigger than me.

Speaker 4:          01:01:05       You're crazy. Your audience is way bigger than his. You have five fucking million youtube.

Speaker 1:          01:01:11       I mean, daily active as like a million. So. Right. That's a lot. Right? But I'm talking Tomi Lahren is a fantastic example. Okay. Tomi Lahren hits tens of billions on facebook. Example, hot girl and the conservative Jews out there, grease in their guns, the decanter lefthand that are super excited about that. They love

Speaker 4:          01:01:29       a hot conservative Va. She's mean she don't like mexicans,

Speaker 1:          01:01:36       but she is very one side, right? Yes. It can be under the veil of. I hate Snowflakes, but there's, there's hypocrisy in that a little bit in the sense of every time she's screaming, she does seem like a snowflake on some of the topics, but putting things, don't you think that's for effect though for dramatic effect because half of it is performance. All right, but that's the thing, right? But it's aimed at one group of people and you've seen the massive rise where it started as this kind of small thing. It blew up. Now you see her on fox news, but she doesn't even need that because she has a giant platforM. It's definitely a good move for her to be on fox news. Right? It's a different audience, but it is playing to one side. I still don't think she's as big as you. I think so. Nothing. So go to her. Her,

Speaker 4:          01:02:18       um, her twitter feed. Find out what

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       our twitter feed is, how many she has, and then go. How many twitter feed people you got? 800,000. I'm not huge on a bet shit. I'm actually as the last. What about her? Did she have to look at the engagement though? Because she mentioned you're one of those guys. You paying attention. I don't pay attention to.

Speaker 1:          01:02:36       No, that's no. You don't care about the engagement. if you're a sales guy and you're like, he has 5 million.

Speaker 3:          01:02:41       What did she got here at 6:40. Oh, you've got a beat or engagements or engagements? A little low. how weird. Oh, she's got her. Hashtag final thoughts. Fuck off tommy. Oh fuck. Off of your final thoughts. Get outta here.

Speaker 1:          01:02:56       She, like you were saying whether you consider it, whether you consider it performance art, whether you consider it anything and it plays one side and it has been a very massive successful rise. I think that, but what I want to do for the longterm.

Speaker 3:          01:03:09       Okay. He is not taking that into account. Like you're saying that if you went one way, show me another guy who's gone one way who looks like you have reasonable, normal looking fella. You're not a thing. Some super buff, a pro athlete or some, uh, androgynous weirdo that people can't take their eyes away from your, just a regular guy

Speaker 1:          01:03:30       king if you're looking at maybe like monthly views on owned and operated sites, youtube, all the other places. Uh, the young turks who I'm not really a like, I know them, but I'm not a fan of the messaging a lot of the time. They're massive. I think they get more,

Speaker 3:          01:03:46       been around a long time doing that stuff though. They get a lot of monthly views, but they also get a lot of hate, man. There's a lot of people that hate watch jank comments. Woo. They go after him. He should have. He should watch youtube for like a binder. We could only look at the video shit on. We can't read the comments at all. Hire someone that only reads the comments, don't read them at all. Don't even engaged. Stay away.

Speaker 1:          01:04:20       That I liked. I liked the conversations on mine though. I mean you have people that are, that are really passionate, but then there are a lot of threads where it's like people having conversations that didn't work normally

Speaker 3:          01:04:28       agree with each other. While I'm saying this, the whole reason why I said in the first place is more of a compliment than anything. I think it's a great thing that you're very. Like, here's a perfect example. The way you handled the milo yiannopoulos thing. I think you're very fair and I think. I think it's great that you're neither left nor right, but rather reasonable. You know, you're reasonable and considered and I think that's one of your strengths. I don't think you would have a bigger audience if you just went all right. I think you'd be a big old phony and less less. You became felina and then then you, you, you got some tits and put on a nice little dress and then you could wear like a sleeveless shirts, you know, because right now if you wear sleeveless shirts, you're a douche bag because you're a male, right? If You're a man and you show your arms, you're a piece of shit,

Speaker 1:          01:05:15       so I got to start going to the gym because I no one wants to see that. Now

Speaker 4:          01:05:18       they would. Maybe they'd be lIke lena dunham type thing, even bigger. So if you're going to go and become a woman, you either become a hot woman or a fucking sloppy one. A really sloppy one who celebrates food and this is who I am. Love it. Or leave it. Fuck off. I find that finally

Speaker 1:          01:05:33       the lena dunham's end up doing more damage to their cars then then good.

Speaker 4:          01:05:37       Or she has 100 million twitter followers and she's got food stuck in our teeth and no one gives a shit. Big old fuck. Fucking sloppy arms like a, like a 300 pound man's legs. This is nothing wrong with it.

Speaker 1:          01:05:50       I, uh, I remember like a few days before the election, she put out this fucking animated video where she was talking with her dad and was the, it was the death of the white male. And I was like, oh, that's awesome. Women empowerment by destruction of another dope.

Speaker 4:          01:06:05       Amazing. She's doing it all on a platform invented by white males. How bizarre. True, true gel. It's called the internet. Actually. I know al gore and he invented his movie so white. Well, the death of the white male, but whether it be like, well, those people don't want to fuck me. Death.

Speaker 1:          01:06:28       Oh god. When it was the odell beckham jr thing, did you see that? This was a while ago. She sat at the same table and she wrote this whole post about how he looked at her like she was a piece of garbage and he was like, what? What are you talking about? I was just trying to be humorous. Did you say the humorous thing? I dunno. It's because I think she, because she wrote this. Then apology where she was like, it was all in my head. It's like, ah,

Speaker 4:          01:06:50       got it. Did you try to not mention her as much as possible, but it happens so often. You know, the weirdest thing was how she was giving a free pass for sexually assaulting her young

Speaker 1:          01:07:01       cisco. The weird like shoving things up her vagina when she was little. Like, what will. So that's where, that's where when you say like, I'm reasonable with the milo thing, well, because you have to take into context other other people, right? Is it, is it a hit job, but also what you said earlier where people are human beings and like let's talk it out. So milo said some, some things that even he said he apologized for others, he said was misconstrued but. But it's. And then there's the george decay thing which is different but still the same

Speaker 4:          01:07:31       two k thing you have to explain to people because most people have no idea what you're talking about. So sorry. Yeah. So this is a problem for me. I have conversations in my head that then I, other words here are just so entrenched with media. So much shit coming into your head everyday. The assume everybody else is watching the same video. So they're, they're actually living their lives. so they went on, they did a hit piece on george decay essentially to sort of show that george takei. Well, he was talking about his own personal experiences when he was very young with a camp counselor who did some sexually inappropriate things to him, but he was talking about them in a very positive way that he enjoyed it and people are saying george decay is promoting sex amongst 13 year olds as being okay. No, he's talking about his own personal experience and being honest about it.

Speaker 1:          01:08:12       Well, and then the way that ends up becoming a comparison is the. Because it ends up being this weird argument of numbers of lines in the sand where he said, I said 13 because that's when I had my first experience. Then we talked about the the age of. Oh god, I'm trying to remember. He talked about the age of 14, which was a, I think when you were. So that was a conversation he had with you with the situation. Right. And then people were pointing out that it's his. His mindset changed and my argument there was what you're talking about. To me, even if he at the end, at any point before, before he acknowledged it, it to me it sounded like he was a victim and, but then that creates the argument too of if someone's a victim early in life, what does that excuse later on?

Speaker 1:          01:08:55       Now I'm not making the argument that milo then went on to do and became a sandusky, right? He, he was having a conversation and it's words, but at what point do we excuse things? And that's just like, that's a conversation I'd like to have where it's, it's not damning. I don't want to go in on a victim, but also at the same time I'm going, it's fucking weird to me and I think it's completely wrong if you have an adult, let's try and fuck a 13 year old. I think that's completely wrong. Like just when you feel like you always have to put people in, in your, uh, in, in their shoes. Where if I was a parent and I'm dropping my kid off the fucking middle school and I find out some 25 year old is fucking my son that's going to. I'm going to go to jail, but that's gonna be a fucking dead person. A dead person. One hundred percent that someone's molesting my child. No. Done.

Speaker 4:          01:09:43       Yeah, I mean, I completely feel you and I understand what you're saying. I think with the milo situation is very bizarre because I think there is irreparable damage done to people when they're molested as children and I think milo has been really clear about the fact that he was molested and he's tried to paint it in a positive light, but he tries to paint a lot of fucked up things in a positive light and it could easily be his rationalizing and trying to figure out. No one wants to be a victim in their own life. Made it a positive thing.

Speaker 1:          01:10:13       Control it was him. Yeah. So that's why I say like, let's, let's think of it in that way. Rather than going, he's against me. Let's just destroy him. Well, I think the besides outlandish thing

Speaker 4:          01:10:23       that milo does that. I mean, he's a merchant of outrage. That's his business and when people get outraged back at him and if somehow another sticks like this pedophile stuff, you can't be upset. This is the game that you just started to play. If you get knocked the fuck out, you know if your bike tyson and all of a sudden you get knocked out, are we supposed to feel bad for you? You've been knocking people out your whole career. This, he's a merchant of outrage. If it's valid, if the outrage is valid and I think it's valid. I think that what they're saying about what he was saying is absolutely valid. If he says that there can be incredibly positive relationships between very young men and our young boys rather an older gay men and that this could keep men from suicide, hit the brakes, stop. No, it's fucking illegal for a reason and you could potentially be encouraging someone whose fence sitting right now thinking about fucking kids to hop right over to the other side and start doing it because it was positive for my low. It does because it was beneficial. It is the conversation

Speaker 1:          01:11:25       also to that extent. There might be someone that is 13 that's being abused that all of a sudden it feels like that's normal. Right. So, but let's, let's talk about it. I 100 percent, don't agree with the words. It is a tricky situation because you are talking about someone that was a victim of a heinous crime and then just talking about talking about it and going from there.

Speaker 4:          01:11:44       But it's also he said that he was gay at the time. He knew he was gay and he was. The sexual predator in every situation has its own variables. Right. And in his look, he's clearly a damaged guy. OkAy. And I liked him. He's clearly a damaged guy, but the way he lashes out and the way he gets attention, I don't like the left's reaction to him. I like that far less than. I like what he's saying. I feel like with a guy like milo, he's not doing any real violent things. He's not doing any real damage. And what you should do is confront him with words, bait him, pick apart his arguments about feminism, about transgender people, about gay rights, because he's got some crazy writes about, he's got some crazy thoughts about gay people and he's gay. He thinks that it's a choice and he thinks that it's a, it's offensive. And if he could have a pill to not be gay, you would take it in a heartbeat. And like he said, all kinds of crazy shit.

Speaker 1:          01:12:38       What do you have someone like milo or anyone else? The number one thing shouldn't be, let me silence that person. Right? Because that's just going to one, bolster them, validate them, let them talk. Right? So when, when you see situations like, like berkeley, where I did see, I had people that sent me videos and there was like, there was a protest in the beginning that it was just people being outspoken and there's a fucking crazy chaos. People I know that you've talked about before, of like the people getting sprayed in the face with fucking pepper spray people beaten in the streets. Obviously. I hate those people. What? What I really, really hate is the people that aren't doing that, they're like, yeah, that's what we should be doing that aren't doing like, are you fucking crazy? You think this is a positive. You think this bolsters your argument that that we're going to go against what we don't agree them that they're saying with fucking violence. You think that makes you the winter. That's insane. It straight up and saying,

Speaker 4:          01:13:30       well, it's also the. They put these blanket labels. He's a nazi. He promotes genocide. He, they say all these things and they say these things so that they can attack.

Speaker 1:          01:13:40       Well, there was a whole. Yeah, that whole. He's a fascist nazi movement. After Richard Spencer got punched in the face, which once again, who's Richard Spencer or. Wait, wait, wait. Am I getting the name wrong now? The guy that will double check. Go ahead. You've. You've made me doubt myself. Now he's part of a two, two, two, two, two, two. You might be right. I mean I'm definitely. I just don't know who it is. Yeah, you always. You always see his face. He just got booted out of c pack for my understanding, so he's. He talks

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       about just look them up. You're not going to. I imagine you aren't going to be a fan, but people were like, he's a literal nazi. We got to punch these people that people like overjoyed, so he really is a nazi people just happy supremacist. This guy, I don't want to. I don't want to label this guy on it. I think that you would call himself a white nationalist or anything like that on the website. Oh, he's neo nazi nazi everywhere. I don't know if he calls himself that. I'll double check. Yeah, that's the thing. I don't want to. I don't want to slam a label on someone and then do that thing. Right. So it's hard, but. So he got punched in the face. Everyone fucking cheered for it, but the problem is then then they move. Then you move. The goalposts have, who's a fucking nazi.

Speaker 3:          01:14:51       All of a sudden cutie pies. A fucking nazi ever. Ever. Everyone's a nazi and we can just be violent. Punch nazis. Yeah. The punch nazi thing. And so the whole. The whole thing is just debate these people, right? So like just just let them be their own undoing if they are actually that wrong. Well, I think there's a. Does a giant problem with groups humans when groups of humans get together. I mean that phrase mob mentality exists for a reason. It's not, you don't say mob mentality. People go, why? Whatever. Do you mean philly date? What? What is a mob mentality? No, people know it happens. Giant groups of people face something called diffusion of responsibility and that means when chaotic events are going on, they don't take responsibility for their own actions because they're a part of this gigantic, chaotic movement and I personally, and this is just totally unfounded.

Speaker 3:          01:15:35       I'm definitely not a scientist. I think he came from war and I think people are used to large scale tribal war and I think it's been going on for so long and the atrocities that are required for you to survive and war, like battle axes and shit, braveheart style. I think once that breaks out, you'd lock into this massive mind sync with all the people around you and you use. Except this violent chaos and I think that happens on campuses when people burn it down, burn it down, that is the same mindset. EveryoNe is involved in this, this hurricane of chaos and you just get swept up in this mob mentality and it's a really dangerous thing. You know, like I'm sure you saw the girl that got maced in the Face that had the matan bitcoin great again hat and he hit her over the head with a stick.

Speaker 3:          01:16:22       Like, what in the fuck are you doing? Yeah. If you think that's okay, I think you're in the wrong 100 percent. It's just a girl. Just a girl nonviolent non non non motion. She was, she was stationary. She's not threatening whatsoever. I think if you listen to the audio before all of it happens outside of that clip, she's, she's literally saying, I'm actually surprised things are pretty calm here because sometimes things go out of hand and then 20 seconds later pepper spray to the face, they just decided that her hat was a trump hat and so they just blasted her. It wasn't even a trump hat. I mean, it's just, it had the right font so she had to get punished and that's so I feel like that's the big thing of understanding whether it'd be a 60 year old maN that did it to her too, or she don't know that something insane, don't know that. Find out that because someone, someone told me that, that it was a 60 year old man that

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       a pepper sprayed her in the face. So, I mean obviously we're talking about different kinds of severity, but there are people on both sides and it's, it's important to acknowledge that, that want to burn the whole fucking thing down. Whether it be a person or an argument for your 60 year old man, you're still a fucking loser and there's a pretty girl in front of you and you're like, fuck you. And I was young. Uh, yeah. Nazis. It's ridiculous, man. I, I'm a very much of the belief that we have rather than more and more people are putting in talking about generalities where it's the left versus the right. I feel like a lot of the conversation, a lot of the stories end up being about these, these far left and far right. People that are like fucking pack manning their way to the middle and just slowly absorbing more and more people into, into their opinion.

Speaker 1:          01:17:56       And what's scary is if they ever do get to the center, right. If it does become all of us in a, an us versus them on facebook, it's a lot closer to that in real life. so how, so after the. After the election, I don't know about your personal like family and friend group, but how many people like cut off contact with each other for awhile because on mine, holy fuck. It was like war. It was war ending of relationships that had, had, had been longer than a decade. And sally, your family, family members, some of most of it, a lot of its extended, extended family. What happened? Just just people just saying like, well one there was, there was a, I come from a family that they're, they're fine with like independence. So there was rIght after the election, there was that whole like all independence did this.

Speaker 1:          01:18:43       Even in California, if you voted for fucking anybody, you voted for jill stein, you took away from client. Do you know how the electoral college works? You fucking idiot. Oh, California is going to go to someone else. But yeah, just people going to each other because they're like, if you voted for trump, you're a racist, sexist, a monster. And if you voted for hillary, you wanted people to not have healthcare and she's a fucking crook and should be in jail and just train the swamp. Yeah, I went to, I went to like, I love the people I work with, but I went like emotions were high. People at the, at my office were like, we have a team of like 40 outside of my group of people were crying like it was chaos. I know dude who was in the cia and he was telling me about his office where he works at.

Speaker 1:          01:19:29       One of the women at the office was openly weeping. Oh wow. And he's like a, hey, that's a. Can't do that here. This is a place for that. This is a week free zone who can't weep over democracy. Not going your way. I mean for a lot of. For a lot of liberals I knew it was like a national day of mourning. Yeah. And then for, for everyone else that voted for him though, it was the day that will always remember, oh, there's a lot of people that were super happy, that's for sure. Yeah. I feel like everyone was was either like burning bridges or coming out to their Friends in a way of like friends and family as trump supporters because there are a lot of people that were scared. Yeah. Well I think

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       that he represents a lot of very dangerous things and he in a lot of people's eyes, this is the death of responsibility. He can get away with more things and then also these all the different business ties and different entanglements and all the different things and and also just the way he communicates that like people don't feel like it's statesmen lee and it's not. It's not representative of what they would like to think of as someone who is the president of the United States. They want to think about someone who's incredibly noble and well spoken and the best representative that we can have, you know, like, forget about obama's policies. Okay. Just forget just him as a human being, standing in front of that podium, talking as the president was a joy in that. He was very measured and very calm and I think that he is also very articulate and very well educated in that thing that he represented when he was up there at that thing. The president don, that figurehead that he represented, he did such an amazing job of representing that because he was exceptioNal. He's an exceptional man. He's exceptionally smart. He's exceptionally well read. He's, the way he communicates is smooth and even the way he's responded to criticism was very well measured, you know. So I, I though he did fuck up when he was joking aRound about trump back in the day, you know, like he was like, we was joking about trump's criticism of him. But uh, you know what, I'm one thing that you'll never be the president.

Speaker 1:          01:21:38       Dope. So I agree. I agree with what you said about like, I think he's going to be one of the most well spoken presidents of my lifetime. Yeah. Well received. But after the fact, there's going to be a lot of people that look at that and go, yes. But it was all phony. It was all, it was all an act from trump. Trump may speak six syllables at a time and break and then go on tangents. Thanks. Hey, it's in the bubble bad thing. It's in the bubble of that arm brace. But, uh, I feel like there are people that go, you know, he's not the best speaker in the world, but he's more real. Right? So there's gonna be that argument. I 100 percent agree with you about obama as far as like the, the office and the nobility. But they're going to be people that say it's just, it's just bullshit. That's why we needed something different.

Speaker 4:          01:22:23       Maybe. But you know, there's other, there's other people that look at the whole thing and they say this is a well needed break from the system that, you know, there's things, a big test. It's a test of our system that have been controlling the system. People that were deeply entrenched in the left and deeply entrenched in the ride for so long that he's the first businessmen that has been. He's been a participant in our system. He's been essentially paying these guys off for years and years and now here he is like, like he talked pretty openly, which I thought was hilarious about hillary and bill coming to his wedding and

Speaker 3:          01:23:05       that the reason why they did is because he paid them, you know? I mean, he paid them, I think it was more than $100,000 for them to come to his wedding. Oh wow. yeah. That's just how they do things. Do you mean like, do you think he literally paid them where he gave them a donation and then there were like donation. I mean, let's be real about what the clinton foundation is. Whether or not it did good work. It's a goddamn pay to play operation and one of the things they got besides the donations, which I'm sure did go to charitable causes, they got paid to speak and they didn't just get paid to speak a little. They got paid to speak hundreds of thousands of dollars and they did it over and over and over again. Both bill and hillary and there's a reason why, just for the same reason why trump release his taxes, hillary won't release the transcripts of those speeches that she gave to the banks because they would be horrific.

Speaker 3:          01:23:51       If they weren't horrific, she would release them. It'd be really simple. No, I said some great things about income equality and how we all need to, you know, support the impoverished communities. Fuck you. You dId because did you had released that and everybody would go, oh, even though hillary is worth millions dollars, she's super fair. She's reasonable. No, there was none of that. The reason there's a reason, it's a corrupt system, man. It's a system that they figured out how to find loopholes and they've created legislation over the years that have allowed them to skirt through these weird sort of fucking avenues of, of legality, and they get to this point where they're making insane amounts of money as a public servant. I meaN, bill clinton and hillary clinton have earned hundreds of fucking of millions of dollars and doing what? Do you have a business? Are you selling laptops?

Speaker 3:          01:24:40       What are you doing? You, you have a new car to you're selling. Where are you making all thiS fucking money? Oh, just talking how weird. You're making hundreds of millions of dollars talking when you used to be the president who's paying you? Oh, this is weird. THe people that are paying you are the people that benefited from you being in those. Wait a minute, did they pay you off? Are you stiff? Right. But that's the argument and that's what it is. And that's the drain. The swamp shit. I mean, that's where it came from. So donald trump's not guilty of that. So that sort of thing, that thing that he's not guilty of getting paid hundreds of millions of dollars to talk and to give his influence as a, as a person who's serving, whether it's the senate or someone who's a president that's not while he's. While he's getting that money. So he's.

Speaker 3:          01:25:28       He's corrupt in a totally different way. Yeah. He's a, he's a, he's a special one because it's special one. I don't know. I get it. I get it. I get exhausted about it and I hate even talking about it. People were mad at right now. Are they, are they hitting you? I'm sure they are just imagining rogan. No. IF you don't know anything about politics, which the right. I should probably shut the fuck up by learning more and then get more upset and then talk more. I used to joke about. I mean I still do it from time to time that I would want to be president, but when you see these dudes become president, they look, they look like they like one month in, they look like they're in a race they didn't train for. Somebody should have a picture of trump now. I know he talked to at seapak this morning and he was on the prompter is, but I was just like, I don't know if it's the white balance on this video, but.

Speaker 3:          01:26:12       Oh wait, what's this? My friend cameron hanes. Keep hammering five k, the only race I've ever run. I ran a five k asked me many times. I ran a train for it. Seven zero. I thought it would be zero, but I thought we're going to fuck with. I ran the rate. I didn't trade at all, so that's the same thing. She caught me at the end of that race. I was like, whoa, that's hard to do if you'd like to here in shape. So a lot longer than. I thought it was more difficult to run five k than it seems. It seems like I've worked out all the time. This is for pussies, so I'll just go run it now. I think if you think that you could be the prentice, the president, like I have amazing stamina. I have a winning mentality, a winning temperament, you know, like once you get in there, man, that guy looks bewildered.

Speaker 3:          01:26:54       THat press conference that he did the other day where he's just going on and on about everything. Holy shit. That was terrifying to me, but I had friends that are conservatives at texted me afterwards go, he looks unstable. This is making me nervous. Like, wow, there you go. Well, because you're making America great again. You fucks. Kellyanne conway hasn't been on tv for awhile, but what? Like some of the last one, she was just looked like she was wrecked. They got her in a bunker somewhere. They're feeding her adderall and the tone of what to say. She's just like, I don't know if I could do this. I would. I would. I would probably collapse under it all for sure. I would call out. I would. I would decide everything on fucking internet polls. Like you fucking run this thing too. I first of all, I'd be drunk on tv all the time.

Speaker 3:          01:27:30       I'd be smoking weed, but like we got to do is burn down. The whole system broke down. It would be like when they found marlin brando and apocalypse now and the desert, he's talking about the snail going across the razor blade, razor blade. I feel like it's really right now with everyone that's involved in it. It's a. It's a test of endurance. Oh yeah. Right. It's who is going to last the longest. Who's gonna? Who's gonna? KEep on fighting. It's shaking. You know, we're having an earthquake and the earthquake is going to fuck up. All those shitty buildings. All the ones without the strong foundation. They're gonna. They're gonna be brecht, and we're going to have to condemn them and tear them down and start fresh and see. I don't like it. I don't like how this has gone. I would have hoped that we got a savior.

Speaker 3:          01:28:19       I would've hoped that someone stepped in that was a really reasonable person, but I don't think a reasonable person even could get traction. I think our system is so fucked up that we almost might benefit from some crazy ass hole coming in here and doing what he's doing. I don't think you'd get a normal person who one wants to be president and then gets propped up by all the people that are already in empower. You don't get that. That person couldn't agree more. Right? It's like, oh, this person has baggage. Everyone at that fucking point has to have baggage, which is one of the things about obama is that he was so measured and you know, wasn't vindictive and what I mean, maybe behind the scenes you killed a few people. I mean, when you say few people, people will go, well, what about drones though?

Speaker 3:          01:28:59       Oh yeah, I was exactly thinking that. Yeah, I mean he certainly is responsible for that. They killed something like 80 percent civilians. Was it 10 percent of entire populations? I was like, what? I think that was the most recent statistic finding innocent deaths by drone, by percentage. I really think it was. It's super high. Scary high. Even you saying that sentence, it's horrifying, but that statistic exists, right? It's like, hey, can we just google a horror? Google, google horrific things happening right now, just weDding parties, just hellfire missiles on wedding. That's the internet right now. It's us, everyone yelling about politics and cats. What do you got, jamie? Would you say the top one that popped up with nearly 90 percent of people killed in recent drone strikes were not the target. Fuck jesus. But guys, they fixed it. They fixed it from them. My fucking head hurts and on the huffington post put this article out and everyone was like, you know what, let's chill. And then the world was happy. My fucking head hurts when you read things like that.

Speaker 1:          01:30:00       Yeah. I mean we live in, I mean things are a bit chaotic or are chaotic now, but we live in disneyland compared to

Speaker 3:          01:30:07       world and I think that's important for people to remember for sure. But the problem is those people that are over there in non disney land, they're just like you or are they just kinda shitty? Roll the dice. That's what's fucked and that's what's fucked up about this whole refugee thing. This idea that somehow or another, if someone's a muslim, you can keep them from coming into this country. Like, man, I know a lot of muslims and they're nice people. Like you can't, like just because someone believes wacky shit. okay. Whether they're mooneys or whether they're mormons with. I know some really nice mormons. They're fucking great people. If you said, should you get rid of them? I said, no, you don't listen to them. You don't really get a planet when you die. You don't have to wear the magic underwear, But they're nice folks.

Speaker 3:          01:30:47       I know people that believe nutty shit. One of my best friends believes that the the fucking government is spraying things out of the back of planes. When you see those contracts in the sky, he thinks it's like, what does he call this strategic aerosol injection leads? It's an ssi program. Like, no, it's not. you know, it's, it's, there's a lot of people that believe some ridiculous shit and they need the opportunity just like all of us do, to have peace and prosperity and to have the opportunities you take in more information that may make you reconsider your beliefs.

Speaker 1:          01:31:17       Yeah. I feel like when it comes to the immigration thing, there's people on two fronts, right? There's one as far as general immigration people coming through legally from countries and then there's also the refugee program, right? And so what I've seen is a lot of arguments of, okay, so you're saying that you know, these people are displaced, they're having to go through all these horrible things. People are saYing, why is that my problem is because America is the land of dreams and we should offer that because we're great. Why should that? And then once again, not my argument, but why is that taking precedent over me? Who's, who's, you know, I went to college, things haven't worked out. My life's fucking in shambles. I have yelling that I have white privilege all the time and the fucking seems like the world's more and more against me every day. Why? If, if and in their heads like all these people are at risk.

Speaker 4:          01:32:09       Let me stop right there for that guy. I got three words. What's a fuck yourself? And then form words, suck it up. Pussy jesus christ you. Oh, you can be. We'll call you have white privilege. You freaking out, you're in America, bitch. If if things aren't going well, work harder, figuring it out, you're a white guy in America, you're so lucky you finding shit to complain about, but so everybody has their own hand that they're dealt, right, and some people are in impoverished fucking coal miner communities in West Virginia and some people are born in marin county with a silver spoon in their mouth. GraNted we are. We're all aware of that, but if you don't think that your opportunities are far greater because you live in american and are. If you're a syrian refugee coming over here, wrapped up in a fucking tent, you're crazy.

Speaker 4:          01:33:02       You're crazy. And one of the things that makes this place so fucking special is that it's the land of opportunity. As soon as you stop having it be the land of opportunity, you stopped taking in those new people. You stopped giving those people that opportunity and then you make this place a different thing. You make this place. This is this secluded, isolated. You know, put the fence up, put the wall up. Everybody in is in. Everybody else could go fuck themselves. that's not what it is, that you're changing what it is. This is the land of opportunity. This is a country that was founded entirely by immigrants who killed the natives, but that that's. That's what we are.

Speaker 4:          01:33:43       You know, there's. There's certainly good and bad to all forms of immigration and there's certainly good and bad to cultural integration. Cultural integration is where things get really problematic, especially for women, for women and women that have dealt with all the horrific situations that have happened in all these european countries where muslims have come in and the radical ones have wanted to enforce their ideas, the sharia law ideas on the women in the area and they see women walking around me, skirts and all that stuff is a real problem. The Integration of cultural norms and values into a western society that has just a completely different idea of what's acceptable and not acceptable. That's going to take some time and if I was in that area, I get the fuck out of dodge. I would not want to be around. If there's a culture war going on, what people are fighting and arguing over ideas that may or may not include your wife, your daughter, your mother, that's too dangerous.

Speaker 1:          01:34:37       Then you'd have a lot of those same people that I talk about saying, well, why the fuck should I have to move because we're this thing.

Speaker 4:          01:34:43       you can't let that happen in America. That's a different thing, but that's the problem. You cannot let that happen in America. If you get people that are coming, you have to have a no tolerance policy to anyone that's giving anyone a hard time over accepted values in America. Like the way women are allowed to dress or driving cars. What if you come over from Saudi Arabia and you want to kill all the women that are driving cars? You know like what if you would, if you want to impart sharia law and on women that are committing adultery or doing any of the things that are just really. There's no law against a girl decided to fuck 100 guys in America. If a girl decides to rent out a warehouse and go, hey, you know, first a hundred guys get the fuck man, come on in. Like in another country, like you can be put to death for that and that there are women that are arrested that are sexually assaulted.

Speaker 4:          01:35:29       Yes. Like when you look at what sucks is it's not like that was one story. There's so many stories over the years and it's fucking. It's horrifying, but so that's why I then argued because even to the point that you're saying there are people that are scared of that, but there has to be some sort of a zero tolerance policy for subjecting other people to your ideas and beliefs in that way, but it also, every culture evolves. Mean christians used to be a part of the inquisition. I mean that Was, they were torturing people and they were there getting people to confess to horrific crimes and they never really did. They did all sorts of things to people that were nonbelievers and that was a normal part of life in some parts of the world a long time ago. Right. We have to assume that that kind of progress is not just isolated to christians.

Speaker 4:          01:36:16       It's not just something that one belief system can, can sort of embodied that sort of evolution, that this can be something that we experienced in a lot of different mindsets, a lot of different ideologies, and then the opportunity to educate those people in a place where they're free might be the only way that's ever going to change when the echo chamber of the middle east where these people are growing up in these and obviously you're talking about places with very few resources, really dangerous environments for everyone. YOu know, if you're living in these incredibly impoverished middle eastern places where these people were freeing. I mean if you are fleeing, I mean you've seen the videos of aleppo, you've seen the stuff of the news. I mean it's. Anything's better than that. Anything's better than being in a a bombs zone where things are just going off left and right and suicide bombings and missiles and chaos and death and isis throwing people off the roof for being gay.

Speaker 4:          01:37:09       I mean, it's just horrific. So those people that are living in that, it's almost like their life. It can't get any worse. Right? They are in hell. They literally in an apocalypse right now. If you look at a mel gibson movie look, get any kind of crazy mad max movie. How is that any different than Syria right now? I mean it's really not. It's just we know that one of the reasons why we don't consider this the apocalypse right now because it's not the apocalypse here in woodland hills, right? You know, but it's the apocalypse in Syria, it's the apocalypse and there's pockets of the world where things are absolutely horrific and those areas were scared. Those areas going to come here and make us the apocalypse to. Yeah. But I mean it goes back to the disneyland thing where it is it disneyland and where

Speaker 1:          01:37:55       were really pissed that some of the rides are closed than where we're in line and we feel like other people are getting ahead, but it's not. It's not that it is not, it doesn't compare. But I have, I have a bleeding heart in, in, in some capacity is when, when you see those things and you're like, we have to help whoever we have to help, but my goal is to always understand the guy that doesn't want to have to fucking move out of his neighborhood because all these, all these people came in and the culture changed, right? It's just tAking into account his mindset where you're. I mean even you said, all of a sudden you're worried about your daughter, your wife, that there are people that have that mindset. And, and I mean, and we're human beings. It's the easiest thing in the world to create an us versus them argument, especially if there's fear onto my family. I mean, if you're anyone that's a, you have, you have fear for yourself, but anytime all of a sudden you have a family,

Speaker 3:          01:38:45       it's next level will also. I tHink people were worried about people coming over here and not integrating and then coming over here and then they start these communities where they all use the same language and they all use the same. YOu know, the same written language on their signs and then they develop these like chinatown titan neighborhoods. Not disparaging chinatown in any way, but that just as an example of ethnic communities, it's sort of stay isolated, right? Like there's places in chinatown where you go and no one's speaking english, they'll just running around speaking chinese and they can't speak english, but they figured out a way to integrate. THere's, there's also latino communities in this country that are like, that's similarly as well and I think people are worried about that, like that spreading and they say that that has actually happened in parts of paris and it's happened in parts of Germany where these people have come over from other countries as refugees and they've established communities and then they enforce their laws and that was something that my low was going to do.

Speaker 3:          01:39:38       He was going to do some sort oF a march and he was going to do like some, a gay march through, I think it was Sweden. I think it was going to go through like the worst muslim neighborhoods and Sweden, but they just decided it was far too sweet and trips so much promo on a sweetened promo. They're in denial. They're like, no, we're fine. Hey, we haven't done anything. And then right afTer they said that some horrific outbreak took place by the way, it's got a little violence going on there and now that you didn't use to have. Right? Right. But this is growing pains. Like if you take people from a violent place and then you let them loose and like there was this one horrific story about this guy from Iraq that came over some, some refugee and he raped some boy in Germany and his response where they asked him why he did it was like I hadn't seen my wife and six months and I was having a sexual emergency. Yeah. SO it'll be like what? Like there's things. Actually, I don't think it was from Iraq, I think it was from Afghanistan, but there's, there's things that go on in other parts of the world that become. I don't want to say the norm, but they do happen there. Well that they don't happen.

Speaker 1:          01:40:50       That's where I think it's important that in general, people don't have the time where it's important to, to be as educated as possible because if we're, if we're basing things off of the way things are generally becoming or it seems like more and more. Yes. But if yOu're basing stuff off of outliers, um, I think that's where, that's where things are crazy. Were you here? Um, you know, someone that was here illegally, they keep talking about the same story over and over. It was like, it was a someone who are illegally. There was a murder. Right. And it's like the same story and I want to see, I want to see the bigger picture because yes, that's fucking horrifying and a bubble. But what's the, what's the big thing? If it leans more towards, holy shit, this is scary then. Yeah. But if you base something off of like with guns, right? If you base something off of one specific shooting, that is like if you look at the body count, the guns involved specifically if it's an outlier, if it's. If it's representative of a biGger problem, then if you really go after the bigger problem, if you actually want to have an effect, it's not just superficial or that's not just a big stance,

Speaker 3:          01:41:51       well, we all want to be safe and we all want our loved ones safe and so do they mean that's what I think is really important and when they don't anymore, when, when when people don't want to be safe or they don't want their loved one safe, then we have to figure out why. Like what? What'S going on that you're willing to strap your kid full of dynamite and have him walk into a mall and blow people up like and now you think he's a holy martyr. I remember watching some documentary on suicide bombings and they were raising these children to be suicide bombings and they had these pictures of these kids, these holy images of these children with suicide vests on, on the wall that had already committed suicide. And there was a sign in islamic that said, uh, today's actually islamic's not a language.

Speaker 3:          01:42:33       When I talked to her mom, I was like, oh yeah, go with it. Yeah. Well in arabic, excuse me. But it said today's children are tomorrow's holy martyrs. And that was on the wall and they were interviewing these people and trying to wrap their head around this and make sense of it. You know, when you've got situations like that, everyone should be scared because then people embrace their ideology to the point where they're willing to let their own babies blow themselves up in k so you've got a real problem there and that, that is as much of a problem as any kind of cult, any kind of mind control, any kind of. And if, if that's happening over here, yeah, yeah, yeah. That needs to be taken into consideration. But how many people are doing that? What is the percentage? how many people aren't doing that? How many people are productive, kind, reasonable people that are stuck in a really shitty place. And isn't that supposed to be what America is about? So you can't just say there's a small percentage of people that are doing horrific shit, so now we can't let anybody that looks like them in as that gets crazy and that isolates us from the whole rest of the world too. But it ain't easy man and it's not an easy problem to solve and I'm certainly not the fucking guy to do it.

Speaker 1:          01:43:39       right. Ditto. Yeah. Because because the argument automatically becomes, but what if my family right and then

Speaker 3:          01:43:45       secure people. How do you make things secure? I don't know. Good question.

Speaker 1:          01:43:48       Well, there's a screen. That thing is saying no, there's no such thing as safety before they were safety. Right. But you can make things more safe. You can make things somewhat safe. But I mean it, it's a dark thing to think about. But before there were even more of these shootings that happened. you look at why do you have to. Why do you have to blow up a plane or why do you have to crash a plane if you can just get the people in line, right? If you go to a mall, why? There are people that are just, they're all soft targets everywhere. no one's ever going to be fully safe unless it's under some crazy, crazy, crazy like big brother control and I don't want that either because there'll be consequences for going against big brother. So for me, when I, when I talk about these things, it's just it's a we're fucked, but in what way are we going to be fucked situation and I know that can be a dark. I know, but it is dark. It's just, it's disappointing there. There's no such thing as ultimate safety, right? I think I understand the argument of gun free zones, great targets. Their targets everywhere. Well, here's the real question.

Speaker 4:          01:44:48       How do you make the rest of the world? Like if you, if you were some sort of a really benevolent person who is just looking to do the best, the best job of managing this world and making all the places that are in disarray and these horrific war zones and bring them up. How do you. How do you ever do that? Like how do you ever even the world out? No, it's ever

Speaker 1:          01:45:17       we need. We need aliens to come to, to come and get it. That's the only time humanity works out is when we have a common enemy. But the problem is we're always our own common enemy,

Speaker 4:          01:45:25       but I will. But is that inevitable? I mean, at one point in time, people were way worse, right? At one point in time there was like, one of the things that really freaked me out was when they started finding all these scraping marks on the inside of a neanderthal heads that indicated that people were eating the neanderthal brains. And I was like, oh, jesus. Like, and then there was an article recently about cannibalism, about how frequent cannibalism occurred back in the day. And it was, uh, you know, I mean, obviously that's not going on anymore. Right? Okay. Is that the bar far less cannibalism than ever before?

Speaker 1:          01:46:00       That's the bar. We're fucked. We're like, we're not eating each other. I mean, say what you will. We're not eating each other. Well,

Speaker 4:          01:46:05       it used to be that you couldn't just show up in a new town, right? You couldn't just pull your boat up in, into, uh, some doc somewhere. And get out and do some tourists shopping because if you pulled your boat up, that meant you were probably a bunch of rapists and murderers from some other place. You're comIng over with swords and bows and arrows and shooting everybody and killing them. Taking all the gold. Well, that's not the case anymore, so things are much more reasonable in terms of foreign travel, in terms of international relations. Things are much more reasonable to think that if it continues to go in that direction, we'll we'll have a better world for our grandchIldren and our great grandchildren, but what steps have to be taken to make sure that the rest of the world's horrific conditions

Speaker 3:          01:46:50       don't spill over to America? Well isn't one of the best ways to take those people out of those horrific conditions and introduce them to this beautiful free concept is concept of self, government. This, this, this unique place where there isn't a caste system where you can. If yOu play your cards right and you, you're fortunate and you get the right brakes and putting the right amount of work, you literally can go from being a poor person to being a very wealthy person. You can go from being unsuccessful witH no, no job and no hope to being very successful and happy. It's. It's possible here and it's one of the few places in the world when you can build yourself up like that and I think that is an amazing opportunity that probably didn't exist in history.

Speaker 1:          01:47:37       I, I think I'm too much of a cynic to think that the idea of all of us coming together on a positive idea will bring us altogether. I 100 percent think it has to be a bad thing that unites us meteor impact or some shit. Meteor impact fake fake that aLiens are coming. So we all have to come together to make everyone fake them. Well, aliens, I want to kill us in like the next 10 years rather than at some point in the eventual time. I don't think

Speaker 3:          01:48:02       the word 10 years is not good because people are good. We'll deal with it. None at all. They'll just go fucking crazy though. The bottom line is, bro, when the aliens get here, they're going to fucking kill us all. you're raping while you can.

Speaker 1:          01:48:18       I think. I think they're going to be on my side. They're going to call you an alien apologist. They'd be like, oh, he's an alien apologist. He doesn't get joe rogan disconnected from the people.

Speaker 3:          01:48:26       Yeah, man. He's up there and his fucking house with a tv and he doesn't know. He doesn't give a shit about those aliens. He said he did qa drive where he wants to go to duke. Who is jealous of the internet connection because it was in africa. Live in a grass hut. Don't worry. Zuckerberg is fixing it. Has he? Supposedly right? Didn't one of those statement. Bill gates. It blew up right there where they're spending a ton of money on a satellite. It was one of the space that really. That blew up. Yeah. There was supposed to be an nc that the one big one that recently blew up was to provide satellite internet access to impoverished parts of africa.

Speaker 1:          01:49:03       Yeah, man, I don't know. I think, I think the more connected that it is, it's a good thing, but yeah, it has to be a bad thing. That has to be a bad thing that unites us of where we become the we or the us versus them, the other cars, but the problem is there is whether it be nationalism or religion or fucking anything, there's so many things that within our own creative creating us an easy us versus them mentality and I mean I'm a personal believer in that eventually we're just gonna kill it, kill ourselves. That's what you think. Yeah. God damn philly, I think it's just going to happen. I don't want it to happen.

Speaker 3:          01:49:37       Let's, let's, let's hurry things up. It's safer now than it's ever been before. Statistically speaking, today's the safest time ever to be alive.

Speaker 1:          01:49:45       I'm talking about on a grand scale. I'm not talking as a grand scale. when you talk about statistically speaking, that's the grand scale. I'm talking about like the next big thing to happen as far as whether it be all out war, not, not. The things that are happening are happening in our streets right now. God damn doom and gloom. I'm planning for 20, 24. It's going to be make birth rate again. That's going to be mega new. Um, how old are you? I'm 31. So you were young when nine slash 11 happened? Yes, I was in. I was in my classroom and they like wheeled in the tv. Oh wow. What, what grade were, do you remember? I want to say I was in middle. No, I think it might have been my first year of high school. I, I moved around. I'm trying to think.

Speaker 1:          01:50:25       I'm having a hard time placing it, but I remember I was in class. I for my memory at the product's problem with memory is like, I feel like you've made me slightly change it 100 percent, but from my understanding or my memory, uh, they wield the tv and um, it was after the first tower got hit and then I'm pretty sure we watched the second tower get hit live. I think that's what happened. Wow. And that was just in my head. It was a mix of horror a to then also them because they cut to a certain shots because they're the shots that you remember if people running away from the debris, but then there was also shots with people just looking at it and then some people just like walking at a steady pace before the second one hit. And I was like, wow, like nothing for a second.

Speaker 1:          01:51:08       When I looked at the people that were there before the, You saw like the people running in to help people. I thought nothing can destroy us. Like that was, that was kind of my mindset of this horrible thing just happened and it was before the second one hit. So it was like, what's, what's happening? Um, but I mean, I think that's a good example too. I don't want that to ever happen again. Uh, in a, in a smaller, a big scale. But do you remember how united everyone was? that's why I brought it up. Yeah, it was, it was. The problem is we became, we somehow took that situation and then made everything horrible. Um, but, but it waS an us, like we, there was a, there was a united us, it was, it was american, but it wasn't just the united us, it was also the rest of the world was sympathetic to our plight.

Speaker 4:          01:51:53       And there was a headline and some paper in paris that said, we're all americans today that would never happen now. Not in a million years. Have the same exact thing happened. Would it be they would be like, you deserve it. Why are you in, why you in Afghanistan? It wouldn't, it wouldn't be. We're all americans because back then we had invaded Iraq. We hadn't invaded Afghanistan and it was, there was so much more sympathy just 16 years ago.

Speaker 1:          01:52:22       Well, even closer to. I mean, when charlie hebdo, right, they got hit. It was just sweet charlie. Now when something happens, it's like, well, look at what's happening there. We want more, we want that here. Right? so it's, there's, there's definitely a death metal thing where they've gone down all those people that concert or some paris, leon France, the, uh, the truck driver that drove over. Everybody pull. Yeah. And

Speaker 3:          01:52:45       I mean, there's a lot less of. We are right, it's more of look what's happening and it's more, it's definitely more fear based rather than if we're just united and we stand against this, there still is that. It's just not as big. Well, I was in New York right after September 11th. It wasn't very long afterwards. And I remember it was amazing how friendly everybody was. It was just a different feel. People Were shook and their response in recovery to that was people were smarter and smarter, kinder and they were smiling more and it's just, it was a different. It was a different feel. There was more comradery and massive, massive respect to first responders. Yes, massive respect to police and fire department. They had just, there was a different feeling and how the people felt about them instead of being the oppressors, they became the saviors and it not fireman.

Speaker 3:          01:53:32       I mean, nobody ever thinks of the firemen is the oppressors. Firemen. Well, there's was a thing in the riots after the riots in la where they were attacking fireman like they were. Yeah. it was horrible. There was shooting at him. It was, um, a thing where people just decided that the man, whoever the man is needed to go down, whether it was fire department or police and they were shooting at cops and that's insanity. They were burning buildings down that had nothing to do with the riots. And I'm sure you saw there was a, um, a piece on these korean business owners in Korea town. They were invaded during the riots because, you know, they're not the best, uh, the proximity to where all the south central shit was going down post rodney king and these people were on the rooftops just trying to defend their stores and trying to, you know, stop looters from taking away everything they earned and everything they worked for their whole lives.

Speaker 3:          01:54:20       And you know, those moments when things get chaotic, they do open up the door for people to reconsider how fortunate we are when things aren't chaotic. Right? It's, I think that's a very unfortunate thing that we only open up our, our, our, our open ourselves up after something horrible. Um, and because I think that we see horrible thing after a horrible thing, we slowly get further and further away from being able to unite just because it's at least in our 24 slash seven news cycle it seems like if that's just the world we live in, right? It's just like they're scary shit man. Hopefully we can keep that away from us. And again, it goes back to what we're talking about really early on. I just honestly think we're taking in too much data, like your life in my life should really revolve around the people that were in contact with the people that we communicate with and our immediate surroundings and our immediate surroundings. We both work in the same area. It's really pleasant. It's really fine. And the folks we run into for the most part, like 99 point nine percent of them are very pleasant and hi, how you doing? What's up? How are you? Everything's good, you know? And that's really how we're supposed to be thinking about the world. This is, this is our world. But now our world is extended to include Pakistan and North Korea. And what is happening here and what's happening there? Did you hear that? King john owns half brother was with some toxic

Speaker 4:          01:55:44       painters. Like fuck man, why don't have to think about that guy. I don't know. That guy is too many people. There's too much. And that can really give you this really bizarre, twisted sense of the state of the world that the. If you just go out now and look at like bill hicks used to have a joke about that, about watching cnn and it was all about. Because a jane fonda wouldn't fuck ted turner. This is back when you'd go outside and uh, you know, they'd be like today on the news aids, death, murder, pitbulls, guns, stabbings, and you go outside hear birds chirping or where the fuck is all this happening? I forget

Speaker 1:          01:56:20       what I was listening to, but it was, it was, it was a comparison to when people are thinking about the world, when they're thinking about the country, all of that is usually far, far different when they talk about their local community. Because our local community were like, oh, things are for them. A lot of people think things are good. Obviously there are places where bad shit's happening, but when we look at our own community, we're like, that's great and I do think that's a place where we start, right? Make me for sure. May make the local good and try and expand from there because yeah, when, when when you look out and you, you look at it specifically like chicago as the state of the United States, that's not what it is. It's scary. They're sitting side of chicago was actually really nice. Yeah. Right. Well, so yeah, once again you have to look at specific places, but like when trump is saying when donald trump's talking about chicago, this is stuff that I've been talking to my show like two years.

Speaker 1:          01:57:11       I had segments almost every monday where it was like this is how many people died in chicago and it's crazy numbers, but then you look, you look close and you're just like, oh, things are good. And I think that's where everyone needs to start, start locally and then kind of expand from there to get that local to somehow or another make its way into chicago. Yeah. Because most people, you just, you have your, your small little group. You're, you're in a great position where I get to talk to hundreds of thousands, millions of people. Same for me. Um, and, and we're in this exceptional, amazing position that of I feel like I'm so scared to do the wrong thing, but how were you scared to do the wrong? I don't want to mislead people. That's what I mean in the sense of like when I do my show, it's just like I have a whole team for full production and stuff like that.

Speaker 1:          01:57:56       But I'm, I'm researching it because it's my name on the line and I want to really in the past year and a half just focusing like how do we get to the truth? I'm not infallible. They're going to be mistakes and stuff along the way. But how can I try and I guess I got 10 minutes to 20 minutes of someone's life. Right? And that's, that's hUge, especially with how much information people are getting and people hold on to shit that they see in a fucking two second glimmer of a tweet. So I want to make sure that I'm trying in that way to make my community, which happens to be a little larger than your everyday joe. Good. Like a good, good, smart place where we don't have to agree, but we're working on iT. Great.

Speaker 4:          01:58:33       You're doing the right thing, man. It's very admirable. I, you know, I think what we're talking about with chicago, Syria and all these other things too, just when you're dealIng with the data from 7 billion people and that is unfathomable. It's impossible. It's impossible to handle. And so that's why take a look then look like you're saying around you and start from there. Yeah. Because otherwise you're going to at some point and just be completely wrong and I think it's probably a good idea for all of us. You and I included to filter out some of the data that we're taking in. There's just too much at this point in time. You can just be inundated with horrific news all day long if you so choose to. Oh yeah. You know, and there those rabbIt holes you can. Sometimes it's just there, Alex Jones, until your fucking head explodes.

Speaker 4:          01:59:18       I mean you really could. You can go down to all the dark pizza gate rabbit holes until you can't take it anymore. It's just you. You can find the worst parts of the world, the worst pockets of terrorism, the worst, and you just absorb yourself in that data and then you wIll be convinced that's the life that is the world, but I think that's why people have to fight a good fight right now to be like, oh, we're heroes. But I think that's why you have to have people that throw themselves out there that are going to get steamrolled by people that oppose on that specific day, that viewpoint, but you have to have those people because otherwise the just the people that have that time that want to see the world just fucking implode. Right? They're the people that have a lot of people that have that time, so we have to, I think be dedicated to have a conversation and this is the last thing I want to ask you about, and this might come off as being silly, but I think there might be some validity to it.

Speaker 4:          02:00:08       Do you think that this ability that you have and and I have and all the people that come on this podcast or any podcast have this new ability to express ideas and communicate. Do you think that that is having an effect on the way people view the world and that this open form of communication where you know, you and I with I, I've never been trained in the media. Have you Trained as an emt but he told you how to do this right now, but you and I to normal people, we can communicate to millions of people having this conversation and then millions of people will talk to their friends and express their own opinions. Whether they agree, disagree, or maybe have some other things to add to it. They express that to their friends at work and their friends you know at home and these dialogues take on a life of their own and they they they these ideas that we're expressing and that other people expressing at work or at play there, they're more potent now and they spread faster now than they ever have before and I think there's an evolution of ideas that's taking place now.

Speaker 4:          02:01:19       Good and bad. That's where all the whIte privilege shit comes from and all the, all the gender politics and all the weirdness, all of it comes from these turbo charged ideas, these nuclear ideas now where ideas spread to the point where words become taboo and use the wrong gender pronoun when you're talking about a trans person and you're the worst human ever and all these new things that are existing and I think these new things are because dialogue and information is just. It has a different weight to it now. It's almost like the gravity has shifted on it.

Speaker 1:          02:01:56       I think a lot of the reason why we have our positions and other people do it is because it is that it is a, it is a dialogue. It is in a weird way and extended friend, group friends talking about things. That's where people have, I think, the best conversations as far as where we grow, right? If mean they constantly come out with numbers of the trust in media, right? Just like they have an agenda, but if it's just people talking, right, this guy's talking, um, that you don't feel like joe's got this agenda that he wants to just shoved down everyone's throat or they're gonna be people that say that. But I think that's good. It is. There's always going to be shit that then becomes this like confirmation bias. I only deal with the friends that confirm what I think, but I think, I think it's a very good thing. It's where it's the more human way to, to take in information and, and form an opinion and, and grow from it. I think

Speaker 4:          02:02:54       that opinion's going to shift to and move around.

Speaker 1:          02:02:56       It does. Because when people look back and they're like, this person flip flop, that person fucking grew. hopefully. I mean, iT could be completely calculated it on pandora and blah blah

Speaker 4:          02:03:04       data or change who they are. I mean, you, you

Speaker 1:          02:03:07       know, flip flopping things so silly. It's like, oh, this person has a yes, hopefully, hopefully you can have a different opinion that you're not locked into something. And so that's, I think that everyone needs to focus on it with like the not the, not ever going to school for this sort of thing. I've never taken a journalism class. I've talked about it in a video. Uh, I focus on, I call like the liquor method, right? I listened, I questioned, I research and I refute right. So I take in as many sources as I can, whether it be the huffington post and cnn or fox news, breitbart, the donald, anything I want to see where everyone's coming from, right? Then I start throwing out questions, you know, where, where, where does this come from? What do they say? Go down that rabbit hole with research and then I'm armed with information.

Speaker 1:          02:03:52       That's why I think whether you have a milo or you have fucking anybody let people talk so you can learn because information's ammo, right? Information, something that you can take in, understand, but if it's a flawed argument, even if it's opinion based, if it's a flawed argument, then you can use it and then, and maybe it's not a flawed argument, you fucking learn something, right? Maybe. Maybe you thought you were right, you were wrong. That's cool. That's fine. Like, flip flop, have a different opinion. Uh, so I'm, I'm for it all day. I think you got to grow. I think there are people that wake up in the morning, a fucking burn the world, but I don't, I refuse to believe that that's the majority. And, and I'm going to start trying to deal with people I think that are sensible that at the very least think they're sensible. Weed ouT. The ones really aren't once

Speaker 3:          02:04:38       tested and just fucking go. I'm a hundred percent with you. And I really liked what you're doing because I think you're a very reasonable guy. I think you're very well thought out and when you consider things like the most recent milo video you're being, you're being very fair and I think the world needs more of that reasonable and fair. Thank you phil. Thank you sir. Thank you for being here. Thank you for being reasonable and fair. That's it for the week. You motherfuckers. Thanks for tuning in. I love you guys. See you next week. Bye.
