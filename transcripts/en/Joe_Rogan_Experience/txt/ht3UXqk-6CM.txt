Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Vacation with your family? Yeah, we're going to Lanai. Oh, that'd be fun. Yeah. Boom. And we're alive. Speaking of vacations, tell me about Guyana. Yeah, that's a good segue. He'd been there a bunch, you know, I thought it was three. No, why was in. No, I've been to Guyana twice, but between there I went to Bolivia and did like very similar, very similar kind of trip, like doing a river trip with Amerindians. Are those people weirded out by Americans? Because the Jonestown massacre thing. It's so funny you bring up jealous town because there's a couple things that been like,

Speaker 2:          00:00:39       uh,

Speaker 1:          00:00:41       [inaudible]. So the, the, the main group I was with in Guyana, um, isn't the, and I'll surprise one day when I was a, they make a dish, they make a dish with cassava, which is a route like maniac. Um, they make a dish with that. They make a flower from it and make a dish. And I was one day saying that, hey, that's a little. It looks like pizza, right? No, right, right. No comprehension. But like, no thought of what pizza is. I remember thinking like, wow man, like something, you take such a, you know, you just consider such a part of everyday life. It's good to know what it was. Yeah. And they don't know about Georgetown. Whoa. Even though was in their own country, they don't know about it at all. No, it's just not. But yet like what, we'll get into this, but you got to like realize sort of how insular, you know, at the Amerindian communities are who live in the, in the jungle in Guyana, the, they have communication on any new yet more and more now.

Speaker 1:          00:01:41       And there's a lot, a lot changed. The two times I went there with five or six years apart, they discovered sunglasses and I've ever. The first time I was down there trying to turn them on because uh, you know, they, they, they bow hunt for fish, right? Which one of the main ways they get phished bow hunting for fish. And when you're looking into the water, polarized lenses are invaluable. I feel lost without fish underwater. And I kept saying, man, you got to get on board with polarized sunglasses. Not Hand in to. And he, he didn't like it, this guy wrote and he didn't like anything about having them on his face, he just couldn't do it. But then I go down to five years later and um, everyone of those boys is rocket polarized glasses. So you see changes. But yeah, that's the thing.

Speaker 1:          00:02:24       Like I've brought up Jonestown a number of times because in the US, if you say, Hey, I'm going to Guyana, all anybody says don't drink the Koolaid. Right? Really cool aid. It was some like who late? No, it was a Koolaid type. No, no. So when people look at when we had this conversation, because there's a couple of things that are important here. What the poison was, right? So we had a conversation, I looked back up the route, I mentioned. Sure. That they make a sava. Yeah. So there's a root cassava and stuff. So it's the route that gives all life. They eat, they call it. No, but I mean they eat fish and game. Okay. River fish and wild game. And then that's like a staple the data everyday. And the other thing, the everyday is a half dozen things all produced from cassava, which is kind of like a Yam and it's cultivated with slash and burn agriculture and they cultivate these yams and from it they make a flower.

Speaker 1:          00:03:24       Um, they make a type of grain. It's like cous cous. They make a syrup that's used as a coloring agent in a flavoring agent. They make a non alcoholic drink, they make a somewhat alcoholic drink that would be like an equivalent to beer. And then they make a much more alcoholic drink, which would be an equivalent like fortified wine. Wow. They make all this stuff from this, this route that they grow in its raw form. When you shred the root in squeeze the shredding. So it'd be like, imagine you took a Yam and shredded a yam and then squeeze the amd between your hands and tripped out of liquid. That liquid is deadly poisonous. Okay. Dogs, chickens, people, anything that drinks that liquid dies. Jesus. And it's cyanide. So the Jonestown massacre, uh, it was a cocktail of the best. People think that it was koolaid flavor, aid volume and potassium.

Speaker 1:          00:04:30       Cyanide, my question coming home from Ghana was like, did they, was the cyanide from the route where they like doing homemade cyanide, but, and so when I got home I looked into this and it's the, and it seems as though that commune, Jonestown commune had been ordering actual potassium cyanide, which is used in a number of mining practices and other stuff. So it's, it's an available, it's an available compound and dance. They laced the Koolaid width. I'd heard about this cassava stuff. And what, do they know what the process is like? Did they know, like how people figured out how to make it non poisonous and help. Wow. It's just been done so long. Yeah. And the same stuff with like different poisons they use to poison the that people use to poison fish. What strikes me about it is how in the village, like the, the, the, the Macusa village I was in, um, is mostly Macusa, but there's also like Wapa Shoshana, which is another tribe.

Speaker 1:          00:05:32       Carob is no our tribe, but it's predominantly a Macusa village and there's about 300 people with the live in this village and how careless they are with the liquid. Like if you nowadays like picture, like you're like the type of person to like you and me are married to and raise kids with. Right. If you had that type of mom and you had a big bowl of liquid that would kill you if you drank a bit. How that bowl would be monitored in your household? Jesus Christ, that'd be like barbed wire around it. Electrical fence and how do they sit? Just Lazy. They just lay it out and I said I was asked. This guy wrote them at him and I kept returning to this. There's certain things I can always ask and it just like things that he struggled to understand my fixation on it, but I kept saying to this Macusa Guy Rove, who I should back up too.

Speaker 1:          00:06:29       I got communication. So guy out is. It's the only English speaking country in South America. Everyone's got. No, no. The, the, the government functions or English. So if you, if you picture yourself America, it's northeast corner opening out onto the southern Caribbean. That's guy on, it's bordered on the east by [inaudible]. I'm on the West by Venezuela to the south by Brazil. It's 90 percent virgin rain forest and within that 90 percent of virgin rainforest is only 10 percent of the population. So the coastal people's are like creole cultures. People mostly descended from slave trade. Europeans in the interior are the Amerindian groups and um, the government functions sort of the power in, in Guyana is that as the coastal peoples and there's not a ton of interest and it used to be barely any interplay between the Amerindian communities in the government, the government's English speaking. So in, you'll find that there's a lot of English mixed in, in the Amerindian communities in some people like this Guy Rovan because he's sort of a upping.

Speaker 1:          00:07:41       He, he's like a, he has a leadership role in his community and he's learned just standard English very well. He's had a fascinating life. Just how much stuff has changed for him. Uh, so I, you can just converse. Okay. In a way that you can converse in like an a type of the type of English we're talking right now almost, which creates this weird tension between the things that you're discussing and how you're discussing them. Like for instance, to have a guy just in conversational English talking about problems they're having with neighboring shamans in their own shaman, putting curses on each other and it like creates like there's like a strange tension between like how it's being conveyed to you, you know, like how so like, okay, if you're talking conversational English, I guess like a life. It's almost like you'd want it to be when he's telling you this, you'd almost want to be reading it in like closed caption and he'd be saying it in the indigenous language because it sounds weird to have to, to have an idea that's so foreign to us, which would be like a battle of shamans battling over access to wild animals.

Speaker 1:          00:08:55       Okay. Um, to have that delivered in conversational English just struck me as unusual because usually when you're traveling, you're getting all of your information like traveling and Bolivia. A guy would tell a story and he'd tell a story in, um, Tsimshian no one was saying that Shan Chimani. Okay. He tells story in Chimani to a person who spoke Spanish. The person who speaks Spanish would tell it to a person. No, no, no, no. Chimani guy telling someone who speaks Spanish. Then that person telling it

Speaker 1:          00:09:34       to a person who speaks Spanish and English and then that person giving you the information. When you get it through that it takes on a mythical quality. Like you're crossing some space time thing. Right. We're seeing like these ideas discussed in their ancestral tongue. Okay. Yeah. Do you remember I sent you a video of a guy talking about killing a Jaguar? Yes. Right. The language you've never. Like when he's speaking, you're like, I've never in all my travels, I'd never heard of language. It sounds anything like that is a video online. Can we play that? It's online. What was, do you know the title of it? It's a, I think if you type in like, um, Chimani t, s I Chimani Jaguar, seatac. See if Jamie can you pull it up? It's very cool. The language is really amazing. Seem so ancient. Yes. It's not like has nothing to do with like the Latin languages.

Speaker 1:          00:10:27       Just sound. So it's very unique. So I guess what I'm getting at is to hear someone talking about something in conversational English that seems so far removed from just our understanding of things. It takes on a weird quality. But what's nice about it is you can go to a place where life is so vastly different than anything we understand and, and just get like the straight dope right from the source is why I love is Kinda like what's so cool about Guyana because you can go and converse with people who are very much a hunter gatherer culture today, but just shoot the shit with them without ever feeling like you're missing something. It's like the. Everything's not lost in translation and all weird and garbled and in like painstaking to wade through. But you can just ask like, hey, what's up with the local shyman? I'll give you the dope on the Lord. And so they trade spells. Yeah. Well yeah, we'll talk about that. But I, I feel like I was laying the groundwork for a, the Jim Jones poison. You find the video? I thought I lost the word that you were spelling. T S I m a n e

Speaker 1:          00:11:38       t s I m a n e. What does that mean? Chimani. That's how they spell it out. Or they're being screwed up. Yeah. You spell a lot worse when you're not actually writing it out. Yeah, I'm terrible. I don't know how anybody wins a spelling bee ever. Toumani Tsi.

Speaker 3:          00:11:55       Yeah. So if you type in Chimani Jaguar, t s I m a n e Jaguar.

Speaker 4:          00:12:01       Wow.

Speaker 3:          00:12:02       The whole thing is an Amerindian hunter remembers his best dog lost to a Jaguar in the jungles of Bolivia. Okay, here we go. Let's play this because it's fucking awesome.

Speaker 4:          00:12:12       Here we go.

Speaker 5:          00:12:16       Following is an interview with a member of the tribe of Bolivia. Do their inherent difficulties of translating indigenous languages. Subtitles are at times approximate income. So he's explaining where he's saying he hunts for food. I always share that with my family. I'm a good provider of me cutting up the meat in this video. I also enjoyed the adventure. I love trekking through the jungle. Once I was hunting with my favorite dog and a couple of the dogs that ran ahead, barking, they were going after something you meet kit you. All of a sudden my favorite dog just went completely silent. There were about 50 meters ahead of me and I got to the other dogs had gone ahead after something to hear. Can You keep saying my favorite dogs laying there dead. There was a big homeless right side. Almost looked like it had been arrowed if we didn't get, the first thing I did was pick up my dog and said them where the ants wouldn't get those body. That dog was the bravest one I had. I'm not going to translate information

Speaker 3:          00:13:41       that's just watching the video if you're interested, but you get a sense of how cool it is. So the recover. Do we fully cover the poison things? No, not really. So I got home it yet, so it wasn't the same poison, but Jim Jones, uh, he grew up in like, uh, he, he was involved in a pentecostal church. He's involved in the methodist church. Then he kind of became a healer and started his own cult. It was funny. I was reading about him when I was trying to figure out the poison. I was reading about how he was kind of ahead of his time because the Jim Jones massacre in 1979 and a 78 or 79 and one thing to guide them sideways, but with his church was that he wanted to have an interracial service. Wow. And that caused friction in his church at the time earlier in his career and he moved out to the bay area and started this church and then he got like kind of paranoid and thought that his congregants shouldn't be engaging in sexual activities, but he had, he was syring illegitimate children left and right. They go down to Guyana, go out to the jungle, you know, a thousand of them down there. People in the US from the bay area kind kinda like wondering what happened to their loved.

Speaker 1:          00:14:51       They send a congressman down there to try to figure out what's going on. He shows up with a bunch of cameras. The congressman says, you know, he's like, I'm going to help anyone who wants to go back to the bay area, go back to the bay area. He goes to the airstrip. It was a shootout. The congress, the US congressmen gets killed in the shootout and then data all start killing themselves with the poison and firearms and other shit. Two hundred and 70 some kids over 900 people. Yeah, I remember. It's like the defining thing, but then yeah, when you talk to these boys, I'm like, you know, Georgetown, like the Jonestown, you know, the Jim Jones, Jonestown massacre and never drink the Koolaid to like, no. See, I had heard it was budget koolaid. No, that's the summit. It was an I. and that's a debate and in trying to find like trying to like dig around and find the source of the cyanide, which became very important to me to learn for some reason.

Speaker 1:          00:15:47       Um, no, I think Koolaid even tried to distance himself from it was. But they, there's some archival stuff and I guess in this archival stuff, images like footage taken around and photographs around, people have found out that they had both flavor aid and Koolaid on hand. That's hilarious. What it was. Koolaid propaganda that's trying to pass the buck on the flavor aid. So yeah, no, no thing there. And if you could. So if you go up the main river that drains the main river, that drains guy on his elbow and if you go way up the ESC, Weebo and um, you know, you'll get to in a stream that comes in from there called the roup annuity and you go up the roof annuity and then you get to the reward and at the mouth of the [inaudible] in Rupa Nuni is real village. And in [inaudible] village you're a isolated enough where you don't know about 900 Americans and in some other people from other areas night, you know, dying in a mass suicide.

Speaker 1:          00:16:49       Wow. That's around the time you were born. That's fascinating that it's why it makes sense though, that they're just so removed from it. Know. Do they, um, do they use agriculture, like how are they getting this esop day grow peppers and then they grow the cassava and the cassava, like it's kind of amazing. Um, you know, we always hear about slash and burn agriculture so they'll, they'll go in and do a slash and burn in the spot out in the jungle. Um, but it's like, it's like a recycled sort of slash and burn agriculture and I'll break down what that means. So they'll go into an area and slash everything and burden just to clear the, just so sunlight can make it through to the ground. So they chopped the jungle down and burn everything. Then the cassava, like I said, it looks like big yams when you grow it, you just take a stock of an existing plant and just bury that stock in the ground.

Speaker 1:          00:17:45       It will sprout up a new crop and so you know, you're close to the equator so you don't have seasons as much. There's some seasonal variation. They do have times that they do have like they are wet season and dry season, but it's like you always get about the same amount of darkness as daylight and they don't have the wild fluctuations that we have in the temperate zone so they can grow year round and they stage it. So you know you have a crop that's coming in, you have a crop that will become an in three months. You have a crop that will be coming in six months. You have a crop that becoming a nine months and once you get a certain number of cycles, I can't remember how many cycles you get off a piece of ground. You let the ground go feral, give it a few years and then come in and burn it again.

Speaker 1:          00:18:27       Also intermittently, every time you plant cassava, you before you replant, you make a little fire and burn some debris in that same spot. No irrigation. You're not watering it at all. Um, and that's the only fertilize you're giving it as you're burning some of the surrounding just detritus scraped up from the jungle floor that you burned there and grow it. And it is a staple of life that in river fish and game, it's just such a wild thing that it's such a poisonous plant. I don't get it. I don't get it. There's all this stuff that there's other poisons that are extracted. I'm like people that, people, that people in South America and the jungles, people that use blow darts so people to hunt with blowguns is generally understood. Like even talking to even talking to them Macusa who hunt with bows and arrows. I asked them like, why don't you guys hunt with blow darts?

Speaker 1:          00:19:21       Blowguns? And he explained me, we don't need to because we have aeroplan, which gives arrows. Now if you were in this other area, you know, more up in the mountains and there's no Arrow plant, then you'd hunt with a blow dart. So is aeroplan just to plant that makes like a shaft, like makes the Arrow what it, what is it? What is the type? It's like a cane. Well you know what it looks, it looks, it looks like a, it looks like a palm. And the palm leaf puts out these long pieces in one. One of those is ready you, you caught it green and then they can make an Arrow no time. So you go out of the jungle, find this piece and you're like, like, like you know, like one of the theories on how we domesticated plants species would be that it was a very gradual, unintentional domestication where you would go out, I'm going to just take something simple like let's say a lot of raspberries.

Speaker 1:          00:20:15       Okay. You go out and you gather raspberries and you bring them home and you eat them near home and then people are eating these seeds and shitting these seeds out and pretty soon there's a lot more grass berries growing around your home village just for the simple fact that you always bring the seeds home and discarding them around in, in creating it so they have it except for maniac, which people don't even really. I don't think it's really well understood what it came from. It's been domesticated for long time. All the plants they use are widely available in the jungle, but tend to also have some around home to that they've brought home and plant in nearby or they just grow up there now because they've been bringing this stuff into their village for so long. So aero plant is readily available. Um, they cut the Arrow shaft green and it looks like just a green dial, but it has some curvature to it.

Speaker 1:          00:21:13       Then no come home and they start a fire and they heat the green thing just by twirling it over. The, over the embers are over the flame twirling it and getting it hot and it'll let off a little steam. And then you bend it in a neutral and get a hot and bend it. And you'll eventually make it, well arrow straight. Then the they make for different kinds of arrows depending on what they're hunting for. So let's say you were making a arrow to a, it gives you more. Let's say you're making a big game arrow. All right? I'm in the big game they hoped would be red brocket deer, white lip packery, which is a favorite, um, collared Peccary, which we call have Alina and sometimes tape here. The, the, the air they use for that, so they would take that. So let's say they're going to build one of those, so they take that green shaft and straighten it.

Speaker 1:          00:22:11       The next step is they find a wood called bullet wood and they cut what would be like a, what's going to form the base of your tip, the base, your spear and that bullet would, they fit into the end of the green shaft, which is almost like a picture to having the consistency of bamboo and they shoved that bullet would nair and it causes, it forms like a base into that. They take an old machete blade, did they cut out and file down to be about a four inch steel knife? And that goes in to the bullet would to, to the forms the junction between the Arrow shaft and the steel piece. That's the only man made material they use in their arrows. Then they take a plant that looks like Jaco and they make their own string and they got little bits of rubber from rubber trees that they wax the string with and they put a bullet would knock in the part that that you're, that you're bolstering actually pushes on and that gets tied in to the Arrow shaft and then they fletched Arrow with feathers, some Guan or black Curacao or crustless Curacao and that's what they fletch their arrows with because they have, they're very water resistant.

Speaker 1:          00:23:28       So they're broad heads are made at a machete. Bleeds. Yeah. And this is a recent innovation for use to use wood. And how long have they been doing it with machete bleeds in his lifetime, it's always been. They don't call them, they come cutlasses enrollments, lifetime robbins, 32. He's a kind of my main friend down there that hung out with both times. I was down there in his lifetime. He remembers people using. He remembers people using blades, which is made from like a bamboo, like material. So it'd be like a convex spearpoint cut out of bamboo and sharpened. He remembers people using those, but he had always used cutlass blades. Wow. Now in Bolivia, you'd see people who have, who are just using the the old form. There are other arrows when they make arrows for hunting birds and they make arrows for hunting fish.

Speaker 1:          00:24:19       The only man made material on those arrows is hog wire fencing, so basically wire fencing. They snip out the hunks of wire, smash it down till it's flat, and then they can cut barbs and there to hunt birds and hunt fish or the bowl is this not a laminate boat, so they make a bowl by just cutting a tree, single piece, a single stem tree, shaving it down to what they're after and then take that same Yucca plant, pull out the fibers out of the Yucca strands and make bold strings. That goes very quickly as well, like we made a bolstering one day. Wow. Yeah. You just, they, they, they, you take the strands and twisted like imagine like you're rubbing your hands to warm them up. You got all those strands in your hands and you roll them and it makes singles and it makes strands that are comprised of, you know, a dozen fibers. Then you start braiding up from there until you braid up a big long bow string and that's how you string your boat. So when they're shooting their bow, like what's a long shot for them, like 15, 20 yards, long shot, long shot and the length of shot you're going to take sort of depends on um, kind of depends on. Well, they don't really think like

Speaker 1:          00:25:33       the idea of the like that you're going to wound it and it's going to get away. Doesn't weigh on them very heavily. Right? Like in our culture and our hunting culture here, we've come to like really a,

Speaker 1:          00:25:46       the wound loss is something we do a lot to avoid. Okay. There's a lot of talk where I don't, you know, you shouldn't be surprised to get a good hit. You should know what's going to happen. Don't take shots that are too far away, right? We really put a strong value on, um, when you let the air or go, or when you let the bullet go, you damn sure know the, you're going to have a quick clean kill. At least we, we put a lot of value on that in practice. Sometimes that stuff goes out the window, but anyone would say that that's your goal. I'm not on their mind. You see them take some hail Mary's right, and they can shoot. Like if you're, if you're trying to shoot a bird, all they're trying to do is get a warrior point. So one of those arrows I described fitted with a long wire on the end, cut out of a piece of steel fence with a barb with a couple of barb's filed into it and that head is joined by string to the Arrow shaft so that once the head makes contact, the Arrow shaft can fall away.

Speaker 1:          00:26:47       But there's a string connecting the arrowhead, the wire barb to the Arrow shaft and that allows the tangle up up in the trees. So when they shoot, all they really need to do is pick that thing with that wire. Barb know that the bird or the hunt for a large aquatic rodents, knowing that the bird is going to get tangled up in the trees overhead and that they can then climb up to go get it. Even then, I think even shooting like that kind of thing where you're just trying to pick the thing. Thirty yards, be very long. Shoot and fish. You're not shooting. I mean shooting fish. You're not really like bow fishing, which I've done a lot of in my life. A 10 yard boat. Fishing shot is very far. Yeah. You're right above them, right? Yeah. Because you're shooting down into the water.

Speaker 1:          00:27:33       Now, do they have, do you have to judge when you're shooting into the water, you have to judge differently, right? The way diffraction. Unless that thing, unless that fishes sunning um, unless that fish is stunning and it's back at the surface of breaking the surface, uh, you need to account for refraction. So you're aiming way low. Now if you've got a fish that's a fish two feet below, the water surface is extremely hard to hit because it's so deep. Your aim and like you're aiming at your boot. Well, I mean it feels like that, you know, your aim and so there's a, there's an equation so low you're aiming way below the fish because refraction, like anyone's ever taken a fishing pole and stuck in the water. Right, right. You see the hooks. So that's like, that's like the trick of both fishing. But were they both fish for some of the stuff?

Speaker 1:          00:28:20       My favorite thing that both fish down there is also you also dealing with current and they're, again, they're shooting a hollow arrow. That doesn't weigh shit. It doesn't cut through the water at all. So they're holding way low for refraction and holding way upstream because their Arrow is so buoyant. Oh Wow. Now, uh, an American, both fish and reg, which I shoot has a fiberglass Arrow, so the current isn't as much of an issue because that arrows so heavy that it can cut through the water. But refraction is the same. So that's why, uh, a point blank shot both phishing is still very difficult and then you've got to factor that. You still need to hit the thing pretty good in a place where the arrows is not going to pop out. There's a fish. They bowhunt hunt for that they used the bowl hunt for for salted fish called the era [inaudible] and airplane was the biggest freshwater fish in the world.

Speaker 1:          00:29:16       They say they're going to. Sturgeon. Yeah, the largest freshwater fish. The largest. Okay. The largest scaled. An [inaudible] is the largest scaled freshwater fish. How big is it? I mean, they'll get him up into the hundreds of pounds. I've never even heard of it. It looks like it. It's, it's a r a p A. I am a. yeah, that's an Arab hyman. She says, Christ that looks completely prehistoric. They have a bizarre relationship with these fish in the Macusa do in Guyana, so that's amazing. They used to hunt them looking creditor. They used to hunt them to export the salted meat based 100 to sell. Assaulted me to markets. Okay. Now, uh, one of those is worth $7,000 to them alive. Holy Shit. Because that's how much. That's how much a white guy will pay to catch one. And let it go. Oh my God. Yeah. Oh, so it's a guy like a guy will pay more to Macusa, will make more to take a guy out to catch an error.

Speaker 1:          00:30:21       Piman let it go. Then what you'd pay to hunt for elk in the US on a guided trip. Holy Shit. They get seven grand to catch an error, paella. And when Rovan was a kid, they would go on to week hunting trips where they're gone for two weeks with their father. They would go for two weeks to hunt salt fish. So they were. They were operating at a dug out canoes that they would have to paddle and they would paddle a duck that would make a dug out canoe themselves, paddle the Dugout, can you up river for a week to get to the good hunting and fishing grounds. Then they would hunt and fish for one week until they would get 100 pounds of salted fish. Then you'd go back down river, which would take a day or two days and then get to the mouth of the Rupa Nuni River and paddle up the Reuben Nuni river for two days to another town and then they would haul the salt fish, including era of flesh and sell that 100 pounds of salted fish for 75 US dollars.

Speaker 1:          00:31:29       So two weeks plus work for a family for $75. And now they will not touch those fish because they make a handful of people every year go down and give them seven grand to catch one, let it go. So seven grand to them must be just an enormous. It's changed everything. When I was talking about like that, they discovered sunglasses and shit. There's been a lot like they were already onto this air pilot thing. The first thing I went down and it's, it's changed everything about it. It's changed that village, the air pilot fishery, the way they used the arrows on them out of trees, they would. So you're familiar like when, when a river, a river flows in asp pattern, like repeating s's now. And then, um, during high water, a river will jump one of the assets. You've picked it up saying yes. So the river jumps and ass in it, abandoned in the main channel abandons the curves of the S. okay.

Speaker 1:          00:32:24       Those curves become what's called oxbow lakes were during high water during a flood. Those oxbow lakes are connected to the main river system. When the water goes low, the oxbow lakes become a isolated air pimas living those oxbow lakes and they on peacock bass and other stuff. So when the water got low and the era pimas, we're all kind of restricted to very small little spots in the river. They would climb up in trees overlooking these places and wait for the air pilot to come up near the surface and shoot it with an arrow. There was a detachable, basically Harpoon head Arrow and shoot it with the Arrow. The Harpoon had, would detach from the Arrow and the Arrow would float on the surface connected by string to the Arrow shaft. You would then go take a hand line with a hook and file that fish in your dugout, canoe until you could cast your hook out and catch your Arrow and then you're connected by your fishing line to your Arrow and your arrows connected by the tether to the Harpoon head and you would hand line in and slaughter the Arab Ima, Jesus, and then drive the era.

Speaker 1:          00:33:41       Pama was salt and they and they still have salt fish day, like when we're out fishing, they're salt and fish all the time. They would salt that fish and then sell it and then that became an endangered like that became like a, a very threatened species under the thing and the I thing that they would hunt for is would hunt for giant river turtles and sell the meat and I'm greatly depleted because their whole lives occur on this one river in. Once those market influences came in and they had moved beyond subsistence hunting and fishing and they moved into market hunting and fishing. They did the same thing that we did to our own country in the late 18 hundreds, early 19 hundreds is eight. We're on course to entirely deplete the resource through market demands because their village gets more and more people all time. It grew considerably in the five or six years between my two visits and their environment just couldn't support that level of market hunting. So this era pimas thing, chi is giving gives them a way to make money to, to buy staples and run a school and stuff like that. It gives them kind of an out. And it's funny because like a,

Speaker 1:          00:34:56       I'm a lot more interested. Like personally I'm a lot more interested in a guy shooting fish, arbitrary and salt in the meat than I am a dude like me going down to catch an error [inaudible] and let it go. So in some ways it's sad. Yeah, it's sad just because like it's not sad. It's great that they're saving the fishery, but you see like just, it's just sad to see shit changed man. And why do they let it go? Why don't they give it to the people that live there so they could use it for the meat. They let it go so they can catch it again because they want to make sure that the population stays laughing. So Robin, what, here's the thing, the reason that one of those oxbow lakes, uh, got lower and lower and lower and someone, one of their guys, one of these Macusa guys realize there's 26 era piman stranded, an oxbow lake and the pimas are running out of water and when the water goes down, the air pine will excavate.

Speaker 1:          00:35:48       He'll keep excavating in the bottom to even just save a little spot for himself. Okay? And a guy found them in. They're all in there, but there's not enough water to, to cover them up. They can sip air is the thing that makes them cooler. So you can always find era [inaudible] because they come up the gold bear, Jesus, the role air and very loud noise they make when they come up to gold bear. So they can live in low oxygen environments. Like if you took most fish and threw them in a stagnant oxbow that's got six inches of water in it, I mean they're dead. His Shit right? Is there a pimas they can just keep excavating a little spot in the bottom and just wait, praying or their equivalent of praying that the water level comes back up and liberate them from the oxbow?

Speaker 1:          00:36:31       There still needs a huge fish. Yeah, giants. So they found 26 that were out of the water in their backs were all messed up from birds and other predators grab in the air trying to grab the era pimas and then they went and spent four days. These are 26 air time is between 50 inches in upper eighties in length. They spent four days moving these 26 Arab pimas into the river in a canoe full of water. Jesus Christ. That's all valuable. Those fish are to him now. In the old days it had been dead. His Shit. Right? Like you just sold them. Yeah. So they just like a fine night. They have like on the river, the river that they call home the river, they kind of control. There's like a finite resource. But the thing is other groups, so they're mostly [inaudible]. And my friend Roman's Macusa. Um, his wife is Wapa Shauna.

Speaker 1:          00:37:27       And there are other Wapa Shauna's and other places who will come down to hunt their area and they have very different like these other groups that come in have different hunting practices. Like Robin was telling me one time that he was going up. So the largest snake in the worlds of Green Anaconda, their river has the largest thing in the alligator family, which is the black Caiman. Some people say, oh, it's not a true alligator, but the largest member of that. How big is Emilia? Black Caiman. Yeah. They get big. They get bigger, like American alligator big like yeah, they get giants. Some black came and stayed. There used to be a market for those. They use the market hunt those for the heights for bags, boots and shit. So they have the giant River Otter, which is a river out or like way to go up river otters go to 100 pounds.

Speaker 1:          00:38:17       They had the biggest snake, the Green Anaconda. They had the largest aquatic roden in the world, the largest freshwater scaled fish by some definitions. The largest eagle, which is the Harpy Eagle. The Philippine Eagle has a bigger wing span, but some like when you measured by weight, the Harpy from and then there's another harpy that's a giant, like the Papillon, the Papa New Guinea heartbeat. The heartbeat is that one that eats sloths and monkeys. Monkeys and shit. Yeah. Was amongst some bad. We saw one really. So I'd been down in Harpy country three times. I finally saw my first heartbeat. Wow. Yeah. Just like suggestic, just piercing, kind of unforgettable. I'm just the face on it to the male, the male face. You're looking at it. It just is like a. So it remind me the first time I saw links or are you just looking at it and it just. So freakishly different than anything you'd looked at like that harpies face. So they had that. Um.

Speaker 1:          00:39:21       Oh. So he's going up the river. He's telling me this story, how the whopper, Shawna will come down and hunting and hunting different than the Macusa. Like the Macoun aren't that big on killing Tay peers. But the WAPA Shawna will come down in their area and he says they come down with arrows and got 12 inch steel tips on him and he's like, you know, those boys are Hunton tape tapirs. But he said one time he was going up river and he sees a Green Anaconda and he goes to look in. It's got a arrowhead stuck into it and he said, and I told my companion, the whopper, Sean are here, and they go up the river low mit. Of course they come to a whopper, shawn at Camp [inaudible]. The walk was shot. He said he's like talking about this particular watershed as a lawyer, but he's like this particular group of Wapa Sean is it travel ahead of Christmas?

Speaker 1:          00:40:09       Because he's there. They're like, they have animist, you know, mystical systems. But they also. It's also infused with a certain level of Christianity. So ahead of Christmas, the Wapa Sean and will go on a couple month long hunting trip to get food for Christmas celebrations and they'll travel overland and by river to come down and hunt them Macusa river. And when they come down, they're there. They're playing for keeps, so they come down there hunting Arab. Hi Emma. Which these, which the Rebbe Macusa do not, uh, they're hunting anacondas. They own everything. They eat the Anaconda. Yeah. They dry all that shit and the fat, they like to render the fat down because they feel that it is helpful for, um, they feel that it's helpful for arthritis. We pulled up on, uh, on, uh, we pulled up on an Anaconda one time that was 13 or 14 feet long just sitting on the bank.

Speaker 1:          00:41:06       You can walk up, you can walk right up to it. Robin was telling me, um, again, a type like mysticism and when we have our own beliefs that would seem absurd, right? To an outside perspective. But he was telling me if I were to touch that Anaconda with my boat, it would die a very painful death if I just laid my bowl him on it. And about how long he says he thought about it at about 45 minutes. Just the belief they have. If you touch it with a hunting bow, it will die in 45 minutes. But it's painful. How bizarre. No experts, I asked about that a thousand times and never got any more clarity on it. Net. I say, can you touch it with a stick? It doesn't matter. Go ahead. Touch it with a bolt will die. So. But yeah, they don't eat it, but he was telling me if you're really hard up and have really bad arthritis, you can take the fat from Anaconda and help cure the arthritis.

Speaker 1:          00:42:07       How much fat is an Anaconda? I don't know. I never. I never cut into one. I've seen a rattlesnake skinned. They seem like they don't have any fat. You gotta understand how big these things are though. They're so big. I mean way bigger than your leg. Yeah. Was 14 feet long. Fourteen feet long was probably weighs hundreds of pounds, right? Oh yeah. No, hundreds of pounds if you eaten rattlesnake. Yeah, it's not bad, right? It's not really. Says that sucker. Yeah, there's, there's a good one. Jesus. Yeah, that's a heavy fucker. Yeah, those guys struggling for dudes struggling. Oh, that's out a guy on.

Speaker 1:          00:42:42       Did you ever see that movie with Jennifer Lopez? Nope. Anaconda. So giant one like. Yeah. So that's the biggest snake. And uh, they'll eat cayman's anacondas well, yeah. Yeah. And it came as lead them when they're younger. Yeah. Know it's a vicious amount of everything you eat and everything. Um, so these, these gentlemen, the Macoun, she came down the Wapa shop, Ashana have different hunting practices and different things that are acceptable to eat and they have. And this is a group of Wapa Shauna. So the hunting and fishing socks are going after each other. No, that was a different story. Now it's different pissing match with someone else. So, um, so there was that. They're hunting area sucks that this group of Wapa Shannon that come down to rape and pillage on the Rebbe A. Yeah. Robin, explain to me their hunting areas of Piss, poor hunting area. So why do they stay there?

Speaker 1:          00:43:43       I don't know. I don't know why they stay there. Hmm. Um, and I asked him to like, does it go, does it make you guys mad today? Come down because now the, like the people in the predominantly Macusa reba village, um, is onto a, they're on like a pretty progressive conservation program. Like they can just dig through their market hunting practices. They got a glimpse into the future and didn't like what they saw and they were on a pretty aggressive program about sustainability. I'm their eyes toward the future. The WAPA Shawna are this group of Robuchon or not. And when I asked them, does it piss you off to the whopper? Shauna come down here and oh, they also the whopper, Sean offish with poison Macusa. Don't fish the poison. Do they use the poison from the cassava? No, they a poison. They use a, uh, there's a root and the leaf that are both poisons the root.

Speaker 1:          00:44:39       It's an thing use here in the United States when they have to do a fish kill. Like if you get a big population of invasive fish in a waterway and you just need to like wipe the whole thing, clean Ed's shit like that when you're trying to do a fish kill. We in the US use a thing called [inaudible] and it's derived from a South American plant. And then there's another plant called Barbato. Well, some people, some, you know, it's like different people in different areas. And the Amazon drainage as a thing they call Barb Bosco, and that is a leaf that you just pull up and it would look like you're just like taken. If you just imagine if you took a bunch of time or rosemary and put it in a mortar and pestle and pulped it, and then you take and spread that in the water. That'll kill fish.

Speaker 1:          00:45:19       Both of, I think they kind of, they act in two separate ways. There's two types of fish, poise and one inhibits the fishes ability to pull oxygen from the water. So I watched them apply this poison and you need to get area. There's not much current because it'll just wash the poison away. So you get into one of these oxbow lakes, apply the poison kickback 20 minutes and pretty soon all the Fisher up gulping at the surface and then you shoot them with bows and arrows. Wow. Um, what's the other way of doing it? And wrote none. And I can't remember which category wrote downfalls and, but there's another one that has some kind of like some kind of neuro effect that it has some kind of brain in somehow impairs some other aspect of their body. But these fish poisons are classed in two categories.

Speaker 1:          00:46:03       I'm sorry, I'm not more clear on what the two are, but I know that the ones that just prevent it from be able to get air and the other one keeps the police in them. The ones that don't suffocate them, does that come up when they eat it? No, but they were telling me that, that um, if you need to watch your, if you're poisoning a pond, you need to watch it and make sure dogs or any livestock don't come down. It doesn't last long. And they were telling me usually the fish you don't shoot will recover if there's some amount of water flowing through it. So they might go in and build a temporary dam to block whatever inlet. Let's just say it's a, it's a isolated channel off to the side of river. They'll go in and pretty carefully with rocks and logs, block the flow, coming into it, poison it, and then once they've gotten whatever they want, they unblock it and let the clean water come in and they'll resuscitate the fish.

Speaker 1:          00:47:00       Whoa. But yeah, if, if they said of livestock dogs, people drink that water can kill that. It can kill that company. Do they lose people? Every unit that Kusamba water man and talking to me, you realize they lose this like a handful of things that people get lost too. Um, they had mentioned people dying from anacondas. They'd mentioned people dying from Black Cayman's. Um, I know that injuries from puranas are common snake bite. The snakes are everywhere. Like in one of these, I remember sitting in Robin's friend's house, his outdoor, like a Palapa kind of house, you know, with hammock strung in it and they're just being a giant tranche. Low like a two and a half inch diameter transla. And I'm not even doing anything to it. Which randall is, they just hurt. Yeah, they hurt. They don't really fuck you up like a black widow or something along those lines before we found a kid who had been hit by a scorpion young kid and um, some scorpions can be fatal.

Speaker 1:          00:47:56       He was vomiting, he was very sick, but just the fact of life. So when they get bit by snakes, they getting bit by poisonous snakes. Yeah. There's one, I think the most debt, the deadliest snake in the western hemisphere, the coral they have. Yeah. They have all the ones he mentioned, their chief getting hit by a, by a venomous snake and them having to call a medevac which is not in the air for I think the air force came in with a helicopter and got them out of there and he was fine. Wow. Just the fact that law, that shit's everywhere man, but they got an eye for it and you don't like, like you're like, you guys, you know the, the non locals eyes, the one getting stung and bit and shit. Yeah. I can only imagine like the first time I was down there I got hit by an electric eel a couple times.

Speaker 1:          00:48:41       Right. That scared the shit out of me, but it's like you don't even know what's happening. You're in the water and Austin, you're kind of getting electrocuted. There was more in tune with all that stuff. That's a strong blast. Yeah, it hurts. We have those on fear factor or grab them. It's like grab a barbell. It's like grabbing a hot wire. It's amazing that an animal, a living thing and generate that kind of. Did it voluntarily for a joke just to see what it's like. Yeah. It's not fun. No, I was shocked. That sounds like it's probably just annoying. But I reached in and grabbed it. I was like, whoa. Yeah, that's legit. And it's like, it's like grabbing a, a hot wire fence with cattle in it. Yeah. I watched, um, there was some sort of a nature documentary where something tried to eat it and uh, the electrical eel zapped it and you see this animal just lock up and fall over sideways.

Speaker 1:          00:49:29       Oh really? Yeah, just pedaled. Yeah, just, just completely electrocuted it got it to the point where it just couldn't stand up. Have you. I know you'd like a. you'll pull up some stuff. Have you seen the video of the Jaguar killing the Cayman? Yes, I've seen a bunch of fat solid shit. Right, because you just. Since he's done that, a thousand dollars. There's A. There's quite a few of them online. And here's what's. What's fascinating. What does this cayman with electric eel and alligator and electric eels. Oh, wow. Frying. Yeah, it's just cooking. Oh Wow. No, that's the. Oh, you asked about eating snakes. Electric eel meat is not good. That's one of the many things that the. That's one of the many things that Macusa like do not eat. Look at his body. Just twitching. God, that's amazing. And obviously that's a little alligator, but still.

Speaker 1:          00:50:18       Boy, what a crazy animal. Yeah. Was brutal. I never saw anything about Jaguars killing Cayman's until about three or four years ago. And then there's like a whole slew of these videos coming out. It makes you wonder, I guess maybe the advent of Gopros and all these different video cameras. People take down there and finally started catching it on film. Yup. We missed the cycling bike. We miss the sighting, narrowly missed the siding. We were down there, tracks are everywhere, so particularly because the time was just down there. Now the giant river turtles are nesting, so they just like how we have, you know, just how you picked your sea turtles, crawl up onto a sandy beach and dig a hole that night later eggs and then retreat back into the ocean. Giant river turtles lay like that. But so the sandbars are covered in Boston turtle shells and there are vultures.

Speaker 1:          00:51:12       So like black vultures and king vultures and Cara Cara's around the sandbars feeding on turtle eggs and Jaguar tracks all over because the jaguars come down to wait for the turtles to come up. Wow. So you've seen a lot of that and one of the more surreal, that's a perspective shot, but, but they're pretty big, right? Big with. That's, that's the oceanic. That's not a judgment to look at that sucker. So how old is that fucker? But I have no idea. God does. They live hundreds of years, right? Yeah, they're, they're ancient thing. Might've been around when Columbus was around the, you know, the, the. Are you familiar with the [inaudible] treaty? So, uh, things that band international wildlife traffic, they have. There's a couple of turtles at the MACUSA eat 'em. They traditionally eight giant river turtles and many people still do, but they call that one the site.

Speaker 1:          00:52:05       He's turtle. Oh Wow. Because they now know they can't traffic and there's certainly more so they got like the eating turtle and the turtle. But an image it will be forever burned in my mind. There's two things that this to like sites that'll ever forever be stuck in my mind. And one of them is a, a Wapa, a woman in a Dka, Dka n y t shirt up to her armpit and a riverbank digging out. One hundred and 50 turtle eggs. Giant river turtle turtle eggs, putting them in a handmade woven basket. Wow. Because you know, like Khloe, like donated clothes, like cast off, close wind up, you know, getting bundled. So you see people with like crazy American tee shirts and stuff on where like I have like a Bob's pizza, Santa Cruz, California or whatever, you know, and it's just like something sent down there through goodwill, donation centers, whatever. So they'll have like um, like brands, you know, like, like famous brands that you see like people, you know, in our, in our culture wearing, but there'll be like hunting monkeys in them and like the laggers thing, it creates that kind of tension, you know. So do they recognize the city's like regulations?

Speaker 6:          00:53:25       Do they, did they not eat those turtles? Yeah. So

Speaker 1:          00:53:29       you gathered is kind of loose. They don't traffic in them but they will eat them, but they will eat them. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:53:36       So they will collect the eggs but they won't kill the turtles to sell. So as they become more aware of conservation, like with this giant fish was the fish again, the Arrow piman as they become more aware of conservation to do. Do you see them, like recognizing like, hey, there's some stuff that we have to leave alone. We got to let it recover. I mean, they, they obviously, they're aware of the cycle of life when it comes to their slash and burn agriculture and leaving spots alone, like are they becoming more aware of like what animals they've kind of pushed to the brink of extinction. Yeah. And it's like I don't even know how,

Speaker 1:          00:54:07       which is coming from the younger generation because talking to guys, to our new guy who's I'm 43, this guy just a couple of years older than I am and talking to him. Um, and he was a market hunter. He's glad to see what's happened because he in his own lifetime saw how much they had depleted everything. So he and his lifetime salt, like from market hunting, not just from subsistence stuff, but as that village because the village was a handful of families right then and now it's 305 people. As that village grew, he watched, um, the giant river otters. They were hunting giant river otters to sell the hides into Brazil and they would smoke them out of their dens. So he watched their numbers go down as a 100 pound otter. Yeah. Wow. For convenience. Just as the name would let you know, and very vocal, a large vocabulary of crazy sounds. The giant river otters make they get when they see you, they're pissed and they start making crazy noises. See them. Oh yeah. You see them all the time. They're squawking at you. Like, what does it sound like? It's like a

Speaker 7:          00:55:13       like,

Speaker 1:          00:55:14       wow. But a lot better now. Look at that soccer. Oh, they're easy. And some kind of snake or eel. Wow. Yeah. They make, they have an alarm noise in a number of barks and crazy sounds. Uh, so he watched those get depleted from Hyde hunting, giant river turtles from hunting eggs. He said he could see that the era pimas were disappearing. And so he was really glad this guy was really glad that they'd gotten onto some other way to bring some cash into the village. Wow.

Speaker 6:          00:55:45       And the air uptime of fishing, how do they find out about this? Like people from the United States are like, where are they coming from? You know, I'm not sure.

Speaker 1:          00:55:52       You know, I know that there's been a number of companies, um, coasta sunglasses, company Kosta invested pretty heavily through a conservation program. They have coasta sunglasses invested pretty heavily in helping them establish a guiding system down there to take people out to fish Arab. So these people that come down, trained some of the Macugen how does deal with Westerners, like for instance, um, in the time and we were out, we were out. When I'm with them on the river, we're out. I'm with them participating in the hunting and fishing activities that they do year round on the things that they identify to be sustainable resources because they still, like, they still hunt several days a week, right? Rovan that they live off fishing game. Everyone in that village, all their protein is hunting and fishing protein and some chickens that they raise, but that's all their protein.

Speaker 1:          00:56:57       So they're engaged in, in a daily sense. Like Robin says, he spends about two days a week farming. He spent two or three days a week hunting and fishing. And then he has other obligations yet is to take care of, but he hunts and fishes constantly year round and it's just, if he kills a white lip packery he says, that's good for a week. Did you bring your bow? Yeah, I brought my bowl fish and boat and I brought a regular bowl. Now when they saw your bow, where they're like, Jesus, can you get us some of these, you know, surprisingly not that excited about it because they, I think that they know they would run up against sourcing problems with the arrowverse got a, at one point in time, robin had a recurve, um, but he lost his house burnt down and he lost his recurve anyways.

Speaker 1:          00:57:38       So just for the simple fact that you can make them and make arrows very quickly. They don't need to worry about how you ever sourced parts. But, but they have all this other stuff like machete blades and all these different things. It seems like they would. I mean, if you get a good compound boat, Jesus Christ, I think if you brought one down and left it there, I think if you brought one down and left there, I would get a lot of use will under. Absolutely. Would it be too effective? Like would they run into problems with, you know, like they have kind of a sustainability issue, right? I'll say. Yeah, I think that if you went down, um, this is speculation. I would think if you went down and gave it, if you had down with a dozen of these things and left them there, I think that along that river corridor you would see a diminishment of a handful of bird species for sure.

Speaker 1:          00:58:31       Yeah. I would think because the birds. But here's the thing, here's why it's a little bit tricky because I think that you would also be reducing demand because one of the things about the birds, the Guano and curtis owls is that they want them to fletch arrows, but they're hard to get. So they really want them because they liked the, they classify them under this broad category that you hear in other places called police and basically it's like a term, some people say Paul always refers to a specific career, but some people use pulleys like, like, uh, like Turkey, like bird, like a Turkey being a good edible birds. So the birds that they fletch arrows with are also coveted food items. All right. I would, I feel that, yeah, if you were to bring conventional archery tackle in, you would see that diminished. Now other people will have shotguns, but the limiting factor there is how expensive the ammunition is.

Speaker 1:          00:59:30       So they'll have like the shotgun shell or they might have a handful of shotgun shells that would last them a long time because it would own use when absolutely necessary. Like the Villa David, they've been having a Jaguar problem when we were there. They had over the previous two months, last 24 dogs including a dog while we were there to a Jaguar who comes in at night and kills dogs and chickens. He was speculating that at some point in time they will probably have to get rid of that Jaguar and that it would be a firearm issue there would have to like figure out a solution for with a firearm. So even people that might have a firearm, I'm have limited ammunition and it's sort of a, a, a league, a tricky spot and the legal situation for them to have a firearm. But Bose I think that they would knock the shit out of carousels and Guano if they had good bose but then might not want them as heavily because it didn't need the fletching for fishing. I think they're tackle superior close to superior for bow fishing. Why is that?

Speaker 1:          01:00:36       Because the shots are so close, it just isn't really necessary. Like it's like it's not, it's just not necessary to have that kind of investment and you just tend to lose arrows, bow fishing. So it wouldn't make sense to have very expensive fiberglass arrows when you can make an Arrow and 15 minutes, 20 minutes. Yeah, that makes sense. And then you're still limited to very close range shots. Um, the, like when I was in Bolivia where they hunt for a bigger variety of stuff, including monkeys, a bose would be a gay, like, like compound bows be a real game changer on monkey hunting. So they're not monkey hunting and they won't touch them really that. Here's the couple. There's a couple of things that are really hard to talk. Earlier I was saying like, you have this luxury of being able to have good conversations in English and get your aunts, your questions answered, right? Some things you really, uh, you hit a wall. Okay. Now, one of the things you hit a wall on is if you say to someone like, how many days out of the year would you guess you do x? It just like you never get there. You never get there. Did they not understand years now? They do, but it's just like,

Speaker 1:          01:01:46       because we speak in that way, it's hard for me to understand why that's such a hard question. But you, it would be very hard to get satisfactory answers about how often do you do something. Another thing is like, how much do you like? Like do you like hunting or fishing more isn't something that's thought about because it'd be like, I'll be like, do you like to hunt more, are far more? You have to do both. So it's not like the luxury that we have. But what do you like? But I don't have to do both. You can't do one, but he was telling you he hunts two days a week. He farms two days a week. So we meet like asking the same question a thousand times and finally kind of getting finally kind of getting to a spot because they couched it because one time I pushed him and pushed and pushed him.

Speaker 1:          01:02:36       How many days a year do you hunt and fish and we've talked about this for forever and he came up with the figure maybe 200 or 250. Then later I'm like, how many days a week do you hunt and fish. And I asked them that a thousand times and got to know if you do the math. One of those numbers is wrong. It's just not. And it also like what you like most. Do you like this most like that? Most. Another thing is why don't you eat x? Right? But if I think about it, if imagine if someone came from another country to here and you're driving them around and every single thing they see that's alive. If they said to you, why don't you eat that? Right? Why don't you eat that spider? Right? I don't know Bro. We just don't eat those spiders. Why don't you eat that cat?

Speaker 1:          01:03:22       That's a really complicated question. Like, uh, we don't eat house cats. Let me count the reasons why we don't eat house cats, you know, so, and I'm like, why don't you eat monkeys? He's not like, oh, silly. We don't eat monkeys because it's just like we just don't eat monkeys, but they don't have any weird relationship with monkeys, right? No, none. The more I press them on it, it wound up being he would say, because we have so many fish and they're so easy to get a bite. You hunt white lip peccary now white lip peccary for folks who don't know. And He. Does that look like a Havalina as well? Yeah. So it's a little bigger than handling the main difference from, from a human, a human perspective. Looking on the to what you would. What you would jump at is the gregarious nature of the white lip peccary.

Speaker 1:          01:04:11       So there's three peccaries, there's like the Cohen, I think the Chaco and Peccary, which I've never laid eyes on, White Lipson and collared and the collared peccary a dozen is a giant group of colored pack. That's like a big ass group of collared peccary. And that's what we have in this sucker. Yeah. And that's what we have in west Texas, Arizona, parts of New Mexico, right. So it's essentially the same thing as a humbling. The collared peccary is the havoline. Same exact thing. The white lip peccary November, I said like a dozen is a bunch of collards. Have Lean. I've hunted those in the US and 700 those in Mexico. White Pack. We'll run in a group of 100 to 200 whoa. And white lipped peccaries when I was mentioning in cassava, white lipped peccaries are hell on cassava. Patches. They eat them. They come and meet the stalks, not the route.

Speaker 1:          01:05:07       They'll destroy the cassava patch and they'll dig, but they particularly liked eat this. They'll come in and they like to eat. The young shoots growing up. Now, can they eat the cassava the route or is it poisonous to them? Don't know. I don't know. Huh? That's a good question. I'll wish I would've asked that. I would. If I had a week, I would get a satisfactory answer out of that. So the white lipped peccaries will come into the village and raise holy hell. Everyone running grabs their bows and then they start shooting in the nail, chase them into the jungle and maybe even track them for a day trying to whittle away at them because it's a great meat. It's like the favorite game meat is white lip packery. They like it better than collared peccary because they're bigger, but is it like a pork or something like that where they had like scent glands, so they're very.

Speaker 1:          01:05:53       Yeah, looks like pork has a very strong off putting. The animal has a very strong offputting smell, but the meat doesn't know if you handle it properly and keep it clean. It's never. It would never be regarded like as as good as pork to the American palate, but to the Macusa Palette, it's the best, so their whole thing that we don't want all these animals, various animals, because you have so many fish, flies out the window with white lip peccary, but a lot of the white lipped peccary hunting is also related to the protecting of crops. Now as long as Rovan can remember, real village has had a group of white lipped peccaries that would come through the area trying to raid the gardens and when it came to the area raiding the gardens, they would kill some number of them and then they would track them into the jungle and stick with them and kill a handful.

Speaker 1:          01:06:51       And it was when that happened was a very good thing. They liked the peccaries. There's been a number of years where no packer, where something happened to this group of one or 200 peccaries they haven't for years. They have not been through the village. It's not attrition because he was saying at the most when we get, when they come through and get us, he would say on average we would get actually kill between one and four when they come in and hit the crops if we stick with them and a group of guys goes after me, white killed between one and four and there's 200 of them. So it's like, it's not like that. Like slowly whittle away at them. Right. It just would never account for that. But they vanished. Robin never wanted to explain to me why they vanished, but if I kept pestering him about it and eventually he told me, here's the deal. Since [inaudible] villages now so wealthy and we have so much food, other groups and other villages have grown very jealous of us

Speaker 1:          01:08:01       and he told me that a shaman in another village got so insanely jealous of [inaudible] prosperity through fishing for [inaudible] and through all the good hunting and fishing that they have there, that he got so jealous that he. I'm locked up, that this shaman locked up there peccaries. He doesn't know where perhaps in the mountains they're locked up. Now getting them out is getting them unlocked is difficult because at the time that this shaman locked up there peccaries, they happened to be without a good showman in their village that they have a bad shot when they have a shaman in training his, his. He is a young sham and in training and his powers are slow to develop. So what happened to the old guy, Donald? This guy's powers have been slow to develop. He's getting there and soon he will hopefully be in a position to unlock the packer.

Speaker 1:          01:09:11       Now what's a young showman? Is it like a young president? Like I didn't mean. Oh, does it really? Like we brought up wanting to go talk to him. I got the sense that that wasn't the best idea to go visit with him. Really? Yeah, to like 300 people in the village. Three hundred and five. Wow. Got It. Got It. And I brought up a number of times. Just got the sense that it wasn't the greatest idea to go talk to. So is there, theatrical involves this guy like living on the outskirts of town and he was in town but no claims mystery. So here's a handful of things that was like, Roman was telling me and in it, and I want to say, man, I do not like if I'm here. Okay. If you told me something that I thought was outlandish, I would fucking jump on you.

Speaker 1:          01:09:59       Right. And I'd be like, that's ridiculous right now. That desire to like be right and to dispel a wrongness like I don't have a lick of that shit when I'm talking to these guys. Right, right. I've never like, wow, I don't buy that. Right. It's just like it's so inappropriate. Right. Feeling. Right. And it's so interesting to me and also give such an interesting glimpse into how most cultures and societies were structured long time in pre Christian Times. Right. That it's just like, it's just educational. So I'm not in any way. I'm never saying like, wow, I don't buy that. I'm just saying like, oh, okay. Right. That's great. Thanks for sharing. So magic. Yeah. So I'm not in any way I, I've never like, here's some things that were explained to me. If you're having a problem or you're, your archery skills go downhill, like you have a few misses the way to correct that would be to go up and take the hand, hold the bowstring and punch a beehive and then hold your hand up to that hive because they don't miss and you will find you will. They will demonstrate their accuracy when they bombard you. And Robin was saying that most of them even know to hit you between your fingers where it really hurts. You will then absorb

Speaker 1:          01:11:28       that accuracy in your hand and you will do a lot better shooting. Huh? And the more you can do this throughout your life, the strong group will make you. It's also helpful just even with kids is also helpful to beat him by like a bullet ant for instance. Um, I had the hat and before, and it's awful, but to get hit by a bullet ant to absorb some of the ant strength, but this sharman that fucked up there. Peccaries could also just be jealous of you. And, and strip your ability to shoot accurately.

Speaker 6:          01:12:06       And what I want to point out that robin has an email address. Right? Wow. Yeah. You can email. I email with them. Wow. And he's firm in his beliefs but also also. Yeah. But there's also a rational. It's, he seems fairly rational outside of this.

Speaker 1:          01:12:26       Listen, it's like I'm torn even talking about it because like I don't want it. I'm sort of talking about it because, because I have such a love for him as a person, uh, that I wouldn't want to say that would make, that would like dispel that idea of like did, did, did he did. He's not like that. He's not perfectly rational. Like I would go anywhere with this guy extremely capable. But you're talking about

Speaker 6:          01:12:53       just like some, some long held beliefs. So it's their cultural belief systems are just deeply ingrained and there's probably some sort of a placebo effect attached to all this. They've seen it in effect, someone has cast what is a, there's a, some point in time those, those packers are going to come back into town. Yeah. And then what were credit fall? They'll probably say the Shaman has relaxed grip. Awesome. The new sholman yeah. Or if someone wants credit, it's just a way of explaining the volatility. Here's the other thing. Here's the other thing,

Speaker 1:          01:13:24       like, you know, you could go, well, let me give you example. I'm going to make a point about the way, um, to sort of see a culture in transition, right? Because it's always so relative. But, uh, the, there's a writer as a staff writer at the New Yorker or one of my favorite journalists of all time. John Lee Anderson. You might be familiar this book, Jay, like he wrote sort of the definitive Che Guevara Book, Che. Um, he's a war correspondent rights troubled spots around the country around the world. John Lee Anderson, he wrote a piece not long ago in the New Yorker about a group of people that were, had just made that we're, we're making first contact with the outside world. Just recently, 2015. They had been. They were regard. They were initially regarded as an uncontacted group that lived in the border between Peru and Brazil in the jungle. And for whatever reason, they started coming out to a main river where they were having some contact with other groups and they killed a couple people, bose.

Speaker 1:          01:14:32       So the government was in a situation of when dealing with a first contact group, you can't go in and just start putting people on trial and shit. Like it only leads to more problems. So they were trying to. It's an article about the difficulties of leading, of introducing a first contact people's into sort of a constructive engagement with the outside world. I'm a trick there is some people look and they have some countries have a policy of isolation for uncontacted people and try to enforce isolation. Other theorists on this or other anthropologists think that's completely unfair. That is the most human of tendencies is to find other humans and swap ideas with them. Right. It's like it's you. It would be laughable that I would come to you and say, Joe, I'd like to prevent you from meeting the French. Less. Some aspects of Frenchness rub off on, you know, they're worried about other things too, but they're worried about like disease and stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:15:37       But also a tendency to to the alcohol can be destructive, being lured into prostitution, all forms of exploitation, trying to protect people from this. Then there are also the romance of running into these uncontacted tribes as such that some people. Yeah, so some people say those photos that they took from the helicopter where they see these people are covered in war paint. They're pointing arrows at the helicopter. Yeah. It's amazing. And that's the shit that I'm guilty of, right? Because even though that's what I was going to lead up, this thing where this battle I have in my own mind, right. That even though, I mean they are far, far away there, you know, far, far removed from a first contact people. They're not even, like I said, the guy's got an email address. I'm not trying to paint this as something is not right.

Speaker 1:          01:16:19       But at the same time they made their bows from raw material out in the jungle and hunt and fish for all their protein. I love that shit so much and I like laying in bed. If you told me you can never go back. I want to lay in bed thinking about that occurring, right? I want to lay in bed thinking about a guy having a problem with this shaman because it's just so refreshing and like, like, like mentally exhilarating. So does know that that's going on. So you get caught in this kind of a, you get caught in this kind of. It's almost like the opposite. It's like the opposite of colonialism or something where you get caught this thing of wine to be like, oh these precious cute people. If I could just keep them like how I like them, where they stirred my imagination. Yeah. You know, I just want them to stay like how they are because that's how I like them. Like when I come down to visit, I like to know that they're all doing the shit that's interesting to me, but they're in no way are they perceiving their experience

Speaker 1:          01:17:25       in that way, but you go down and see like in the handful of years as much they change all the time. Right. And the handful of years to see that, just like practices are different, dress is different.

Speaker 1:          01:17:40       Clothing. Very different. So you're just seeing it happen, you're seeing in real time, it happened in a fast way. Now you might come up and be like, oh, and I was in the US and the pre internet days and I came to the US and the post Internet days and um, it man is that place different, but you're watching it like wherever you live, you're also seeing that happen too. So you're living that transition. But to go to there and then come back five years later, uh, and see things different. It really, um, yeah man, it fucking, as much as I hate to admit it and is a wrong is it is. But just to be like absolutely up, but like a kind of bummed me out. So when you talk about, when you saw it from a hunting perspective, because I tend to view the world through a hunting and fishing perspective. When you talk about bringing bows down, my first thought is, oh, that's no fun. They shouldn't do that because I like watching them a lot with the homemade boats right now it's, it's totally rational and it completely makes sense. Yeah. It's just, it's

Speaker 6:          01:18:42       furness Dahlia, and then you find it, you find it as it's changing, you know, as much as you know about the American West as much as you told me about the history of the American west and the native Americans to see these people that are essentially like in some ways like the native Americans before the colonial people arrive.

Speaker 1:          01:19:03       Yeah. Or like a, I guess it would be, this is a bold statement. If there's an anthropologist or a historian listening, they're going to pull their hair out, but it would, maybe it would be like I'm so hesitant to even throw this out. Just it's extremely approximate and full of holes and full of contradictions, but some kind of post contact scenario and I don't know, like let's say it was the 18 nineties or something right here. The firearm was very much a part of stuff, you know. But yeah. Um, but you know, it's, it's makes, it's complicated in the Internet age, but at that time you definitely, we definitely established a form of terrorism in the American West right there by the, you know, I mean, well, before the Francis Parkman France department was this figure, he wrote the definitive history of the French and Indian war. But in 18, 42, he was a historian. He had health problems in 18, 42, he did a tourism trip out on to the great plains. He met some fur trappers, some mountain men. He traveled with the Oglala Sioux,

Speaker 1:          01:20:15       a crazy horse who probably wasn't crazy horse yet. He was his name curly as a kid. Crazy horse. He was in crazy or like the three stooges, I think that, I think that was like a name for mount, you know, and have no idea what it meant before he adopted the name crazy horse. Um, he would have been 13 years old and Francis partment traveled with them as a tourist and they went into the black hills of South Dakota. They went in there to get lodge poles because there was a time you were in there, go in and fit out their lodge poles for their teepees to replace broken lodgepoles. They went up in the black hills, killed some big horn sheep by throwing rocks down on him, off a cliff, went and shot a bunch of buffalo and he was out there like as a tourist, so tourism in the American West.

Speaker 1:          01:21:01       Now you got to remember the last, the last free roaming, the last like non confined plains Indians didn't get rounded up until, depending on your definition of 18, 76, 18, 77, so he was out there way before that. There were still like what they described at the time as hostile wild Indians were running around and he was traveling with them as a tourist. So I just bring that up to bring this idea that here's this group of people who are very much engaged in terrorism. Like I was down there. I was down at because I wanted to go on a river trip. I walk in and it's something I've done a handful of times. I wanted to go on a river trip and and w w and participate in their hunting and fishing and food gathering activities as they engage in them in the same way they might engage in it if I wasn't there. That's why we weren't fishing. That's why we weren't catching air them is letting them go. So there's that in the Internet era, but it's like there's that thing always returned to. It's like you're still, you're still

Speaker 1:          01:22:05       hunting and fishing all your own food or growing in your yard now. When you guys went down there, did you participate in the hunting and fishing or did you just observe? No. Participate in it. You participated with their traditional tackle or did you use your own stuff? Done? Both. I've hunted fish with my own and I've hunted fish with their bow and in the end I wound up the first time I went down I hunted fish the second time too, I hunted for fish. So both fished with um, their gear. But then it always felt like somehow funny too because like there's the thing that happens when you're watching like goofy, you know, watched like goofy survival shows and shit. Desire is the part where the host, you know, grapples with how difficult it is to master ancient technologies. But you're trying to just pick it up and do it from scratch.

Speaker 1:          01:23:01       Okay. Rovan has been shooting that bow at four. He's 32 years old. He's been shooting that boat at fish for let's say 27 years. It is not an unusual thing to him. Alright. So when you go pick it up and be like, man, you got to give props to, these guys should be able to kill a fish. This bowl. It's like, well kind of in kind of not. Because if you spent 27 years doing something, you're damn sure going to be good at it. The same way is if you took someone like one of these first contact people's from between Peru and Brazil and handed them my laptop and said, hey, pull up my g mail contacts from scratch. He might be like, man, I gotta give props to you guys. Had no idea. Right. It's just like, yeah. So I was having this conversation with someone the other day where, you know, the first time Daniel Boone in 17, 60, Daniel Boone went to the cumberland gap for the first time and dropped down into what's now Tennessee and Kentucky and he stayed there hunting hides.

Speaker 1:          01:24:03       He was a hide hunters. They, they're hunting heights for two years, ran out of gunpowder, made his own gunpowder and made it out of a bat. Guano your own piss pot ash, right? You can cook this shit up. Right. And make your own gunpowder. And I was looking at as being the epitome of woodsmanship and the fact that he could do it makes him seem other worldly. How do they, what kind of formula do they have for how much piss? How much bat? Guano, which just something they knew. Do you know the bat? Guano used to be something that was so cherished. People would go to war for it. Yeah, for explosive. Fucking incredible. Not just for explosive, but also for fertilizer. Oh, no. Yeah, that's what the term batshit crazy like the freezer bash. People would fight for bat shit. Yeah. They would go nuts like it was so valuable.

Speaker 1:          01:24:51       That's where all the buffalo bones went after the near extermination of the buffalo really. But the really good shit was bone China, China, tableware and everything else is fertilizer. Wow. Yeah. You could make the same. Some of the same characters that were involved in the slaughter involved in picking out the bones are called bone pickers. Picked up fertilizer. But no, I didn't know that about Baghwan have no idea that bone China. Yeah, there's still bone China. No kidding. Yeah, I thought China was always some sort of ceramic. There's a place in Detroit on the, on the Rogue River in Detroit that have the rouge river, rogue river, depending on what Dude Michigan you're talking to. Um, there's a place there called the Detroit carbon works that used to. So when you're watching movies, including the revenue, you know, that giant pyramid pile of buffalo skulls that turns up in everywhere, every book, every movie.

Speaker 1:          01:25:46       That photo was taken at the Detroit carbon works and what they are producing was bone fertilizer. Wow. Is there more than one of those photos everywhere? Wow. You can't escape that picture. That's an incredible picture. That's. That's taken in Detroit, Michigan, where I'll point out was one of a handful of states that never had buffalo in the history in the history. There's no buffalo, Michigan, so they're extra paid it out of Michigan. They just knows where those bones are picked up in the American west ship by rail to Minneapolis, Chicago, Detroit turned into bone fertilizer and then shipped back out for people tilling up the great plains. Go back to that photo again. The photo. So disturbing. Wow. How many skulls is that? In my book about Buffalo, I'm describing that picture and I say that the man standing on top is like an exclamation point at the end of a long sentence about death and destruction

Speaker 6:          01:26:44       because I can look at them. It's like he somehow realizes the weirdness of what he's involved in, but that was post extermination. There's a crazy, um, podcasts from Dan Carlin on the wrath of the cons on the GIG economy. They describe how the charisma and Shaw sends a, a group to a checkout Gin, China, and they got there like about a year after getting, his con had killed everyone in the entire city, over a million people and they thought what they saw in the distance they thought was a snow cap mountain. As they got closer, they realized it was a pile of human bones. Really. Those guys are hardcore shit. Yeah. Jonestown, what do you. But then nothing but be like, oh, minor. I was like, it'd be like a car crash. He changed the carbon footprint of the human race. Him during his time, they don't know how many people they have the population through deep population cooking fires. They, they believe they killed more than 10 percent of the population, like Gingiss Khan and his people through his orders killed more than 10 percent of the population of the world. And wasn't he the number one

Speaker 1:          01:27:54       land conquer, but just never held on anything. Well, conquered more in like conquered more than Napoleon. Conquered more than Hitler, but just didn't hold it.

Speaker 6:          01:28:04       I'm not sure about that. I don't know about that, but I know that they always lived in tents and they despised people that lived in homes. They thought they were pussies the breath out after their life. They brought out their vulnerable to probably. Right. Yeah. I mean, is anybody listening a wrath of the cons? It's a five part series and I think Dan Carlin, he charges for them. You can buy it on Itunes, but I think it's only a dollar per and is the best value over sees the World War One. Yes. Yeah, and not sure what else he's done. He's done a lot of. I mean his podcast is just absolutely amazing. He's incredible and super humble. Guy Won't call himself a historian, but meanwhile has the best history educational series you can get. It's a buck, a buck a piece and they were like an hour and a half long and they're fucking incredible.

Speaker 6:          01:28:52       Yeah, he's a. he's a real treasure. That guy doesn't call himself in his story because he doesn't use like primary source material or something just reads popular works. I don't know why, I mean, I know he who owns the name, who owns the definition, he's just really humble, but his main focus of study, his entire life has been history, you know, and when he does these things where it's like, well, if he calls what he does at podcast, I need to change. What I do is I what I call a podcast. It's just pales in comparison because we're just sitting here talking. Right? Yeah. Well he does as he prepares for these things for months and sites, different sources and different lunches and then essentially does an educational entertainment piece. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:29:37       Maybe that's why he doesn't like the term his star and his because he's not, um, he's not contributing. He's not contributing to the body of knowledge. He's interpreting the body. Right,

Speaker 6:          01:29:49       right. Maybe. Yeah, that's a good point. Yeah. Maybe. I think he's just super humbled to. He just wouldn't, wouldn't say that no matter what, but somehow, I don't know why more disturbing to see a pile of human bodies than it is to see a pile of the buffalo bones.

Speaker 1:          01:30:04       Yeah. I think I told you I'm not talking about a thousand times what after the custer massacre, the guys that that were following the other soldiers who were coming in after the massacre and they didn't know what had happened. You know they hadn't got word yet, that custer and his entire command had been wiped out by the Sioux and northern Cheyenne and they're riding up the valley and they're looking off in the distance and they're in there see all these sort of white bloody ish things and all these dark brown things and one of the guys wrote that. Their initial impression looking at it was that cost or must have caught the Indians in the middle of a buffalo hunt and what they were seeing was it was summertime and they were seeing fatty buffalo carcasses that had been skinned and that the brown things where the buffalo hides laid out next to the carcass. But when on closer inspection it was. The brown things were horses, cavalry, horses and the white things were stripped and mutilated soldiers.

Speaker 6:          01:31:14       A good image wasn't one of the guys, one of the native Americans. That was in the little big horn water, whatever event. Wasn't he? One of the guys who toured with wild bill? Many of them. So they were. They had killed American soldiers and then they went on this

Speaker 1:          01:31:31       entertainment tour. Yeah. It will be as though it would be like, this is a fucking risky comparison. Now I'm not even gonna say Nazi. No, no, no, I definitely was going to say that x is way different. It would be like a

Speaker 4:          01:31:48       shit.

Speaker 1:          01:31:51       I'm not going to say I don't want to make the comparison. It will come back to haunt me. Um, I'm trying to think of something that would work. It will be like, uh, uh, people that we fought against later

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       became a media celebrity. Yeah. Oh, I guess they're kind of dealing with it right now in Columbia where the Farc right now that Columbia has struck a peace accord with the FARC and the FARC are entering into politics, entering into media. FARC commanders who spent their entire life fighting against the Colombia government. Many atrocities were traded back and forth. They now come on the Columbia or equivalent of 60 minutes to do interviews. Wow, okay. So it's like where you have an adversary that, that hostilities end in the reconciliation is so complete and so quick that you can come, you can become a media personality. And this guy was a touring media personalities. Dol Rule Guy, right? Yeah. Girl, who um, the hospital's name, the historian, evanesce, Connell, Jesus, Ge, all. And there's some photos of this guy, right? Yeah. There are photos of him. See if you can find that. Evanesce O'connell he was, he was huge. And um, the, the novelist who wrote my favorite Costa History, uh, he says that a girl went through custer's men like a wolf through sheep and um, yeah. So it's a hard look, man. He, someone asked him how long it took, how long that fight lasted. He said it lasted about as long as it takes a hungry man to eat his dinner.

Speaker 3:          01:33:31       Wow. That is a hard look and gentlemen right there. Yeah. That face, man. So he toured all over the country. People would pay to see them pay to get their photos taken with them. Wow. He did selfies. Selfies with people. Wow. What a crazy thing. That must've been quite a while. Had some mock war that they would do. They would come out and reenact the battle.

Speaker 8:          01:33:55       Wow.

Speaker 3:          01:33:57       Yeah, so you could go down and this would have been in your own lifetime that people who, the families of the men killed at the battle of little big horn could have gone down and got their photo taken with and paid to watch and interacted with the gentleman who likely clover to their father's head and with a Tomahawk. Jesus Christ. We're not as like we are thinking about how much worse we are now. Right. Is that buffalo bill up there? I don't know if that's him. That's him, but that's from his show.

Speaker 8:          01:34:32       Wow.

Speaker 3:          01:34:34       Pumps. Are we going to say we're not that far removed? Oh No. I was just saying like, we now think we've gotten to such a weird spot, but yeah. You want to point out that people must have been a tad more forgiving at the time. Well, there must have been much more used to death and murder. Yeah, because it was so common and it's just, it was so personal because you know, you're doing it with hatchets axes and guns that don't fire very well. So you do it at close range shooting people with muskets from and there was so much more violence then. Yeah. So much more depth. The fact that you grow up and be so old now and never see a dead person is just a new idea. It is pretty crazy. You know, I got people my age have never seen a dead guy. Yeah. Well it's a real eyeopener when you see one. There's a lot of people that haven't even seen a dead animal. Dude, I could sit, rattle off the dead people. I've seen so many in my mind. How many dead people have I seen? Yeah. Not 10.

Speaker 3:          01:35:35       What have you seen dead people from all? I saw two people that were not just dead, but in bits after a plane crash I saw where was that? Fine. Not even a mile from my house. I was a little kid. Yeah. And then um, and then a commercial plane or like one of those little private, sorry, 57 year old man and a 13 year old kid. I try. I tried recently briefly to find time to go back and find the article. But the way I, here's how the story went down is uh, the way I remember a detail that I remember very clearly is that this guy, it was his neighbor kid and they, he had told this kid's parents, they were going down the wash the airplane and look at the airplane and he decided to take the kid up for a flight. I don't know if that's true or not.

Speaker 3:          01:36:22       I was trying to find that article to confirm that aspect of it. But I lived on a lake called Middle Lake and everybody remembers for whatever reason, this guy balls our lake a couple times really low. There was a guy down on the east end of the lake named Mr Rupert. And I remember what was unusual about Mr Rupert was he would eat freshwater clams, which we were forbidden from doing by her dad. But you know, it's just not as, people don't regard it as a good practice at all, the freshwater clams because the toxins, you know, that's another thing I haven't really looked into why that doesn't happen. People just generally don't eat fresh water clans. But we would go get them and cleaned them. And I remember we cleaned a whole shitload once. So my dad's like, no, but Mr Rupert would eat these freshwater clams.

Speaker 3:          01:37:06       And um, what do you go raw already cook him. I'm sure he would cook them. He said, man, I saw that plane when a dove down over the lake, it went up, but then dove down again and never came back up. And he even told some neighbors this. The next day when we wake up, uh, the sheriff's possy the mounted like our area had a, mounted like a bunch of volunteers who had horses and they were like the mounted sheriff's Possy, right? Like deputized individuals during emergencies such as this. They were all loading up their horses to head out into the woods to look for some plain and another detail that was told to me that I wanted to verify that would I need to do. I just need to go back and go through the microfiche where I grew up in find the article because it was something.

Speaker 3:          01:37:55       It had a signal on it and the signal was picked up by some other country even, but they knew that a plane had gone down and that was a matter of fact. Everyone at this point knew that this plane had gone down and we were riding around on our bikes out in the woods. Just kind of following the sheriff's Posse guys. Is there a sort of combing through the woods and eventually a news helicopter was hovering over a spot like right at where a right. We're at the end of white lake drive and there was a news helicopter hovered over there and my two brothers went directly there on their bikes now as the younger and if for some reason couldn't get my mom and then we drove over and we got to the end of White Lake Road. We had to walk into the woods and there was a guy there tried to block my mom and me from going in there and always married.

Speaker 3:          01:38:45       He said, um, uh, if you could go in there, you better have a strong stomach. And she's like, well, my kids are in there and so we go in there and Matt and Dan here to stand at the edge of the hole there. And they're trying to sort out the trend to sort out who was who inside this plane into bags. I'm not shitting you, man. Like, and yeah, I have some visual details I remember from that are just like, uh, yeah. And then it's kind of a cop. But yeah, I would like, like, and then that was, you know, that. And then I remember we were at our neighbor, Mrs Musselman, um, I remember we were at her birthday party. The cater just fell over dead in front of everybody. So like very non war related things. Right. That's what's interesting is saying like, but you can, you can see that these are just happen chance things. But yeah, you can go through life. We just have sort of set up now or you can be hidden from it. But then you talked to previous generations. Just the, like, just, it was just a part of stuff. Yeah. You know, my old man talked about walking and he grew up in Chicago. He talked about walking out of a party one time. There's a dead guy at the bottom of the stairs that had been beaten to death,

Speaker 3:          01:40:05       just like Dave, just like, then went off to world war two and saw who knows what.

Speaker 3:          01:40:10       So yeah, when people talk about how now were so violent shit, there's nothing to support that. Nothing. No. It's this safe. The safest time to live ever used to be able to hang people from trees and not get in trouble for it. If they're the right color. Yeah. Not that long ago. No, that's what's crazy about this wild bill Hickok Shit. We're talking about what? 18, 70 1880. When was it? And what's funny is he was one of the combatants. So some of those guys like wild bill coding, Wild Bill Hickok Hickock actually had like a dispute over who got to have the name, you know, Bill Buffalo, Bill cody, wild bill Hickok. There was some other wild bill's I guess, and it was like, it was a popular name, right? But they were combatants tube. So they engaged in these wars and the fact that you would later get both sides of the war.

Speaker 3:          01:40:58       It'd be like if you went and got a bunch of Germans who were defending the Normandy beach, Omaha Beach, and you've got a bunch of the, um, Americans who are starving Omaha beach and you had a traveling road show in which they would pretend to inflict mass casualties on one another for paying adoring crowds. How bizarre. Who came up with the idea for that had been done ever in history before? I don't know. My guess would be, you know, there's a guy that was the thing that I've told people bunch of times no one ever believes me to distribute. It's fucking true. It's true. There was a guy one time, you know Niagara Falls, right? You've been to Niagara Falls. No big damn waterfall. Uh, you know, the St Louis, St Lawrence drains the Great Lakes and on its way out to the Atlanta, it was a big ass waterfall. Niagara Falls. I'm a guy one time bought it. There was like a zoo was liquidating its holdings in a man. Bought the zoo and bought a barge and put all of the zoo animals on the barge and charged a dollar to watch him send his barge full of animals over the falls.

Speaker 8:          01:42:22       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:42:24       Wow. So, right. Yeah. Not that long ago. Now I have no js nowadays. Nowadays they'll put you in a cage. Yeah. So it's just. Yeah. We've traveled. What is this, Jamie?

Speaker 9:          01:42:41       From the, when the, when the show started in the world's fair, he got denied from uh, doing the show outside of the world is fairly not talking to Weymouth, cody. So I don't know which one is which, but uh, he found a 14 acre, a swath of land where you set up stands for 18,000 people to watch each show and over 2 million people saw it during like that, whatever, during the world's fair that year was the first one. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:43:09       And there weren't even, uh, there, there were 2 million salt, but there were less, well under probably way less than $75. Million people in the country. Wow. Wow. What year was it in World War Two? There were $150 million. That's incredible. 18,000 spectators. Seventy four Indians from the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota. Wow. 18,000 spectators must have been amazing back then. Yeah. Now. But here. But think about the numbers at that battle that they. Historians feel that at that battle, that was the largest gathering of plains Indians to have ever occurred. An encampment of maybe 10,000. And

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       how many people were there from? What's his face? Costa Costa. He wrote in to one end of the camp. That's why it's not well understood. Like there were other engagements going on at the same time once when you say like coster his command was annihilated. There were other prongs to the attack that were repelled and beaten, but it was only like one prong of the attack that had cost her and that was an isolated and how many people do you have when you rode in with about 200 people and ran into a, an encampment of 10,000 individuals and later some of these individuals like gall and others in interviews said that even at the time, our understanding is that these people were all hopelessly drunk. Oh my God. Because it did not make sense what they were doing.

Speaker 1:          01:44:40       Wow. They just didn't know. It's no one understood that. That's why custard, that's why there's still all these costs are people who just debate and argue and is like, uh, some of his crow scouts. Okay. He had some cree or re scouts and cro scouts who came and told him do not. You cannot go down there in the morning there's, we were playing was attack at daybreak and they said, you cannot do that. That makes no sense. He said we're going, they did their death songs, some of the, some of his scout sang their death songs because they knew what they would be dying in the morning. And um, it's debated. So today, to what extent did he, like,

Speaker 1:          01:45:23       did he believe what his scouts are telling them? Okay. So was it suicide or was it huge? No one thinks that was suicidal. It was either that he just didn't really comprehend what they were telling him or he was so, you know, he was a decorated civil war figure and probably was a very ardent believer in the superiority like of his army. And they were trained soldiers with discipline that there was just one prong of a three year, you know, a three prong attack or two pronged attack. He was riding in the one end of the village, but he does a road into the village and they were just killed. Right. And in independent, in popular depictions, they always show cost her, like his, the last guy standing like there's a mountain of his dead guys around them, you know, and he's still firing his revolver a with long hair and when in fact he had short hair at the time.

Speaker 1:          01:46:14       But uh, some people think that in looking at it, he probably. Yeah. The great one is here. Fell coster. Oh, great image. Yeah. Jamie just pulled up a crazy picture. So here fell costs and contemporary picture did say what? No, no. That's the old classic. There's one that was on the anheuser busch to the time. Yeah. Here fell was a little bit later. But then I'm the one that was the. Anheuser Busch won was by a German guy, I think that was the one you had pulled up that was like desert Bush had. It was like their poster. Oh my God, that's your fail coster wow. Which is

Speaker 3:          01:46:50       considered to be a very accurate. Was considered to be a pretty accurate depiction of what was going on. Now the custer died early. I think he died earlier in the skirt, but she wasn't like the movies. He's got the flowing blonde hair. Everyone's dead and he's still firing away. Of course he was. He was probably killed earlier rather than later in the skirmish. It's so funny because you're right there like he's like, you know,

Speaker 6:          01:47:16       in a different position. It's so funny that, that we've done that, you know, that people have taken what they know most likely we're a storage really inaccurate accounts and they pass them down generation to generation. And it makes you wonder like, this is what we know now because this is only a hundred or so years ago. Like what, what are we getting when we're getting some version of something that happened a thousand years ago or thousand years ago? You know, how distorted

Speaker 3:          01:47:44       insanely. Yeah. But the problem we have as a culture I think is when someone goes to fix, when someone goes to challenge our popular perceptions, um, it's, it's branded as revisionist and somehow like loses, right? It becomes almost like a, it's credentials or tarnished. Do. Remember the guy, I can't remember what politician, Jamie, we'll pull it up. There was a politician who said, um, he famously said, you know, her, we realized that Paul revere the, the, the ride of Paul revere was, didn't really happen like fabricated from whole cloth. Right? Right. There was a politician said, I love Paul Revere. Whether he wrote or not.

Speaker 6:          01:48:30       Well, I mean, when we were kids, we were taught Columbus, discovered the United States. Yeah. I mean, we didn't figure that out until. It's still amazing that it wasn't like the West indies. And to this day it's still amazing that they celebrate that guy when you find out that he was a fucking monster. I mean, the, what was it? Uh, I believe it was a, I'm a minister or someone who has some religious person who came with them at the time, uh, left a journal about the atrocities committed directly by Columbus and his men when they hacked off arms for people, couldn't bring them back. Gold. And I mean, just horrific shit. Smash babies on rocks did it right in front of them. And this guy was a firsthand account of what we're supposed to believe. I mean, who knows how much of what he's saying is accurate, but if any of it is accurate, Columbus was a fucking monster. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:49:17       I think there, what it stems from is that from the perspective in Europe at the time he had,

Speaker 3:          01:49:27       he had solidified and put some shit together that people had been kind of pecking around the edges of. Right. Whether it's continental existed. Yeah. And, and, and, and yeah, just had, it was like a leap forward at the time. Yeah. How crazy is that? But the fact that it becomes that, right? Did he like, you know that in some people's minds, like somehow established America. Yeah. And that we take a day off of school because of it. It's really crazy. It's bizarre. Columbus Day. I mean we still to this day it's 2017 kids get Columbus Day off, don't they? But now it's like, here's the thing, now that no one, now that now that sort of the consensus, right, the popular consensus is that, um, he was a one of many players involved in sort of putting together what was here and sort of outlining where it was and how to get here. Um, he was one of a bunch of players, you know, almost certainly not the first, uh, no one cares about that. Meaning what they mean is you're like saying like, I uphold the idea of western civilizations, annexation of the new world as being a good thing.

Speaker 3:          01:50:51       So when someone says, when someone gets pissed at the revisionists for questioning the legitimacy of Columbus, they're not actually talking about what he specifically did. It's become, it's become a proxy for the cultural annexation of the new world and to say, oh, I hate Columbus. He's an asshole. They take it to me and you're saying that, um, that, uh, you're questioning our claim on the western hemisphere and that it was a bad thing. I think that's why people are annoyed by it. I don't think people were too much annoyed by it anymore because the thing that's pretty much been established there. Columbus is a really bad, but no one's gone in and undid the day have. Have they. Is there any. Is there any kind of change them around, don't they? Well, they should probably come up with another name for it. You know, a Api a. it's still a day, right? I think so. Pretty sure. Yeah. It is kinda crazy though. I'm not, I'm not here to defend the day, but I do understand that kind of how that shit came to beat. Yeah, I understand it. It just seems pretty incredible that just 500 years ago here it goes to war against Columbus Day and the Washington Post. Yes. It's waged by the same people who were waging a war against Christmas. His is really.

Speaker 3:          01:52:06       That's crazy. Indigenous People's Day in favor of indigenous peoples. Yeah. No, it makes sense. Give us a day off. We'll take it. I'm generally like little movements, like little cultural movements like that. I'm generally not a receptive. I don't know. I don't try to read too much into them. If I woke up tomorrow and telling me that we had decided, you know, that people got together and decided against Columbus Day, I wouldn't like do a lot of soul searching on that. Well, you know, you don't work a traditional job anywhere or go to school where you take that day. Oh yeah. I think people that lost the day, they're like too. That's my day, man. Yeah. It's just hard to imagine as I hit walleyes my buddy doug every year. Yeah, you'd be bumped.

Speaker 6:          01:52:48       It's just hard to imagine that, you know, 500 plus years ago they really didn't know in Europe about the continental United States. I, that's, that's amazing.

Speaker 3:          01:53:00       Yeah. We were talking about earlier talking about violence or violent, more violent than I think that we're so tripped up by the upheaval caused by the digital age. Right. And everything. Like, you know, I just changed our sleep practices and just everything. You know, it's a major upheaval. Yeah. But picture that picture that in your lifetime, they all like, you become aware

Speaker 10:         01:53:31       that

Speaker 6:          01:53:33       the, the, the earth did see that there are,

Speaker 3:          01:53:37       you know, three times as many or whatever as many civilizations on earth is that you thought there were. Yeah. I mean that's a huge thing to grapple with

Speaker 6:          01:53:49       a huge thing to grapple with. People that had history, people that had boats, they were seafaring had more history than you. Yeah. It's crazy.

Speaker 3:          01:53:57       Or to think that one day, and this is not too long ago, so you know, some of our grandparents remember this, to think that one day we had devised the contraption that was capable of ending life on earth and that these contraptions could be initiated by the distant actions of a handful of people

Speaker 10:         01:54:19       that

Speaker 6:          01:54:20       that's a change, right? Yeah. The nuclear era. Here's the craziest change in the nuclear era, from the invention of an airplane to someone dropping a nuclear bomb from an airplane is less than 50 years now. I think Wright brothers 19. Oh, three, right? Nineteen, six, 93, early 1900. [inaudible] sustained a flight with a heavier than air vehicle. And then in 1945 they dropped an atomic bomb. That's crazy. That's inside my life. Someone was like, I knew this airplane shit was going to take off, but that is probably one of the biggest changes ever in terms of like the amount of in 50 years in the world to go from no air travel at all to dropping a nuclear bomb out of an airplane in less than 50 years. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:55:07       And to then have it be that it's a staple of, uh, of, of, of American life, they did not just with other people like space travel. You're like, okay, it's this flood of information, but it's not affect me. But with that, it's like that's now how you get around. Yeah. You know, that you like at a time when you wanted to cross the country, you would lose a large percentage of your party to death. Right. You had to plan ahead who would take many, many months to being just a thing. You just do on a whim. Now I do believe like I accept that we are a state of upheaval right now and I think there were probably impacting ourselves in ways we don't fully understand how so digital devices. Oh, for sure. Yeah. Just how you run your day. Yeah, no doubt. How you spend your time, how you run your day will ever go to a restaurant and you see a whole group of people just staring at their phone. Yeah. Yeah. We're laughing with their day. If you're staying at the baggage claim, not looking at your phone, people will think you're nuts.

Speaker 6:          01:56:05       It's true. My friend is looking around trying to make conversation with people.

Speaker 3:          01:56:09       My friend, a conversation. His life has happened with some over. So I was in starbucks drink and a coffee just sitting there and staring at the wall like a fucking lunatic. What, what are they out to you? They're going to start killing people. They're not doing anything with their phone. Um, it, it's a big thing. But what are the helpful thing? I guess one of the help it just bring it full circle. One of the helpful things

Speaker 3:          01:56:38       you know about traveling or about like just reading about history is you stop, you lose some of that sense of specialness about thinking that the life you're living in, the moment you're living it as this great test of humanity or some like super peculiar thing going out when you realize that people have always been involved with and struggle with cataclysmic upheaval, you know, and then to go in to indigo witness some other people in some version of that transition is pretty healthy man. Maybe in the long term, let's just traveling, going to see how other people do stuff. It's unsettling, but probably ultimately pretty. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:57:16       Good for you. Yeah, I think it's very good for you. Just anything that enhances perspective, it gives you like another layer that you could consider when you think about life on earth. We're so used to our own environment, our own ways. It's like you were talking about talking to these people and asking them like, why don't you eat monkeys and now we're stony monkeys have. Has He ever been to a supermarket?

Speaker 3:          01:57:40       That's a good question. A couple of years ago when I was mentioning that I had mentioned to you that, that the, the, the, that a couple of American companies who have a to have like some conservation spending, they do, they were training some guys from real village. They were training some of them to, uh, just how to interface with Westerners. And as part of that, he went up to, he might have even gone up to the Bahamas to go for a couple days to a fly fishing lodge. So I'm getting. So yeah, he flew on a commercial aircraft. Oh Wow. Yeah. I'm just so pleased to see. But he's peculiar in that way now I've brought up to him. I'm trying to talk him into coming up and going. I want to take them on ice fishing trip so I'll take loads your Alaska fish to the ice because what I want him to understand is, um, I'm so uncomfortable with him physically uncomfortable with the, with

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       everything biting me all the time, just everything. It's just extremely uncomfortable. And to him at standard, yeah, it's comfortable, but he's never like if he hadn't done that trip or you know, or just all of his siblings and most other people's village, they never experienced, you know, they never experienced 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Now what is it like to them when it comes to bugs so they have any sort of resistance to mosquitoes or anything along those lines. They don't care about it nearly as much as we care about it. Do they get the same amount of bytes though too? They get chewed up like we do. They complain about tick bites and stuff, but generally it doesn't seem to bother me like we do because it's just a part of everyday life. But you got to get used to, you know, and like and like hanging out in Bolivia.

Speaker 1:          01:59:20       You get bit by bees and wasps at about the same rate that you'd get bit by mosquitoes if you rat like some fourth of July thing out at your uncle's pond, you know, shooting fireworks off at night on the edge of a cat tail. Marsh was like your skin a bit just like wake up and you start getting bit by bees and wasps so they just get, just kind of used to it and then you'd say like, I remember when I got stung by a bullet and asking like, Hey, how many times you been stung by a bullet dance and love them and be like, I couldn't even begin to guess how many times I've been stung by a bullet dance, but it's like, but they just suffer different. So what I want to do is I want him to experience suffering while watching me not suffer.

Speaker 1:          02:00:02       So like I want him to look at me with all. Okay. And so to do this I want them to come up and ice fish wrong and take them up. And I got A. I got a friend who likes to go on. He likes to get on snow machines in February or March out of fair banks. And they go overnight camping on snow machines, fishing through the ice for Bourbon Bourbon. Oh, for a cold. Freshwater links are low. You know, why they call lawyers is when you got a bourbon, his Ah, his heart sway back next to his asshole. So they call them lawyers or vent, you know, fish have a, like a, like a color awake and they have a uni whole, you know, we have like a bird. Yeah. We have a couple outlets and they have a single outlet for waste and sexual exchange. Um, so yeah, lawyer, Bourbon, fresh water, laying.

Speaker 1:          02:00:57       Poor man's lobster is another word for it. So northern fish, it looks like if you combined a snake and a bull frog kind of A. Yeah, I want to take them out to camp in a tent in 40 degree below weather right there. Wow. What a cool looking fish are very good to eat. Yeah. Very good. Wow. Now they commonly caught through the ice or did people catch them on the street? That looks. That's a northern peasant. Dorothy? Yeah. Oh yeah. No, it's kind of a bourbon or not. But in the Great Lakes there. Alaska. Yeah. There's bourbon everywhere. So does it tastes like lobster? Is that why they call it a poor milk? The reason they call it poor man's lobster, he doesn't really tastes like lobster, but it's suitable for boiling it and dipping it in butter and cocktail sauce and eating. Really? Yeah. But y'all should make fish sandwiches with it.

Speaker 1:          02:01:41       Huh? They even sell that shit commercially. Bourbon guys that have like guys that like a native American. So in the northern Great Lakes you have a Jibo to Jibo. I Indians still carry on White Lake. They fish for great lakes, white fish. They trap net, great legs, White Fish. They're able to sell a bycatch of Bourbon and they have restaurants and like in the cup I got some friends that do it and they got restaurants in the ups that they sell their bourbon into and they make burgers. Sandwiches. Huh? Freshwater link to take them on ice fishing trip. And um, but for him to leave, like he doesn't go into Georgetown, which is the capital of this country. He'd have to go into Georgetown and start like trying to figure out some kind of a visa situation and a passport. Does he have a birth certificate? I don't know what he has.

Speaker 1:          02:02:35       I told him that I would try to help him with all that, but he said it's like a very daunting idea that you would like go and leave the country for that. You'd go in and stay in Georgetown, but he has been on a commercial flight. He did that trip. Yeah. So he has done it yet. He has done it. So he had to get a passport in order to do it. His passport didn't last long and now he has no passport anymore is what he's telling me when I was asking him about the feasibility of this and then you don't need a visa for there, but he needed a visa to come here, but I'm going to figure it out. I want to have them up so bad. Wow. Him and his brother Dennis. One of the things that surprised, like one of the things you get is um,

Speaker 1:          02:03:16       you know, you're from what state were you born in? New Jersey. Yeah. See, it's like you've been all over the place, right? Imagine that. Imagine that you hunted and fished and farm and that's all you did. So you're always on the land. Yeah, and you've done it all within a 25 mile, a 20 mile radius of your home, so you're outside hunting and fishing or farming or gathering in the jungle every day and you're in your thirties or forties and you've done it in a radius of 20 miles to what level you understand your spot and without the distractions of the digital shit and without the distractions of an occupation. Oh, he doesn't work at all. Not, I mean, now he did. He guides a little bit every year for the fish. He guides a little bit, but typically not like most days he's not engaged in that activity. So the spatial awareness as the thing that's most striking to me in spending time with, with these individuals is, um, everything I'm interested in, what they noticed and what they never miss

Speaker 1:          02:04:31       it. It's like you realize that all of the bits of information that you're able to contain your head to allow you to function and carry on, right? You're like a comedian and you do shit with mma and you have a very successful podcast and you have a family and you're digitally very astute. And you have opinions about fucking coffee, write all this shit you're widely read, right? That's like all your sort of fill up your brain with as much as it can hold. But for them it's like it seems to be from my perspective is like all of that breadth of knowledge but crammed into the natural world to where every plant, every tree, water its use as what are the other things and it's like they know as much like they know as much as we know, but it's just focused in a way that our breadth of knowledge, which, which would probably be astounding to them if they realize all the shit we knew about, but they're all that, all those bits of information or just applied in a different way down to like a granular understanding of the jungle.

Speaker 1:          02:05:37       It would probably be very bizarre for them to see us. Like walk out to this parking lot, these, a little patches of like plants. We don't have a fucking clue what they are. We pass through them like they, they, they're just peripheral. There is no like, I don't know what that is. Yeah. Wow. No, they know everything and there's toxicity. How many thousands and thousands of different varieties of plants. There's no at various times there's 1500 species of birds. Listen, I like, there was never a moment when I heard a bird call. There was a. I'd never said, hey, what's that bird that everyone there? It didn't say what the bird was. Bird sounds just from sounds like, like in the shit that, like it, it, it's almost something you have to go see is um, the ability to just like move through the jungle and notice everything now.

Speaker 1:          02:06:34       Are they like the people in Bolivia where they're barefoot most of the time? Yeah. But you know, that's another bummer is getting more into shoes, man. A row has still likes to take his shoes off when he goes into the jungle. We went into the jungle after some curse out and uh, and he, he pulled his shoes off to be extra quiet. But yeah. So he'll now and then put flip flops on now and before it is. No Way. Wow. Do they still have the weird feet that are all this catalyst and tozer spread laid out? It's very strange the way their feet look real strange. I wasn't, you know, and I was in the Philippines one time in the highlands where people are just hiking mountain trails, you know, severe topography on rocky ground and the feet there, I've never seen anything like it barefoot. It's almost unrecognizable as a human foot really from your perspective of human foot, what it look like. Have uh, have, have your inner man. He was their photos, their feet out Luzon island, hot, Luzon island, highlands,

Speaker 3:          02:07:36       Coalinga, k a l I n g a feet. I don't know, try that. There's probably some high resolution national geographic's if this, if he's any good at his job, you will be seeing some crazy feat in a moment. You don't. Another thing I wanted to share as you had mentioned, a sort of a surreal image is uh, you know, watching a woman in a decay in why shirt like digging turtle eggs for food, um, through there's, there's flowers or you know, everything's in bloom, right? Um, it was just the beginning of the rainy season, sort of some rain, like everything is in bloom and he's flowers just all fall flowers of all variety, hang out over the river and sometimes you'll pass through. It just has this like warm floral smell that just, it's astounding. I'm it remind me of, you know, and in the end of apocalypse now when Kurt's, when Captain Willard finally catches up with Kurtz and Kurtz, ask them where he's from and he mentions Ohio and Kurt's tells him about a river trip he took with his father on the Ohio river when the guardian he wearing in bloom, you know, he talks about the smell in the end of apocalypse now, but these flowers and smell like that.

Speaker 3:          02:08:55       But when the rain would come, it's going to. I can't even see what you got some feet. Oh, you'll find some feet, boy. One trying to find something better. Here's a. So it would rain. It would knock the all the flowers into the river and you know, like the way. Yeah. I love talking well so. Well from grasping. Wow. They're like almost like a gorilla's feed. Yeah, from like from wrapping your, like wrapping your feet around thing rocks and stuff like that. That one in the middle's I saw, I saw, I saw like a number, like not yet quite a few people that had faith resembled that from, from, from, from [inaudible], like you know, down in the Amazon and other areas. You're just walking on soft ground, you know, but imagine if you're just like walking on slippery rocks and you're using your feet in a way that's not even uncommon.

Speaker 3:          02:09:53       So we're, we're looking at for people that are just listening to this, it's like at the middle of their foot, especially that one foot in the middle to the right. It's like he's tea. It's taking a turn, like a hard turn, like a 15 degree plus turn. Why do those seem like disembodied feet? Because there's just photograph in the feet. I guess real old. This is like a big article about people from the Philippines at thing from the same area. Oh Huh. So wow, go back to it for a second, Jamie, because what we're seeing in this is um, this massive spacing between the big toe and then the first toe to the point where it's like an opposable.

Speaker 6:          02:10:34       That's an opposable toe. Yeah, it's crazy. It seems like almost like an opposable toe. Yeah. Almost like a thumb now. I'm sure. What's at play there too? Really fucked. I could make you wonder like at one point in time was it like that, that

Speaker 3:          02:10:47       that's the thing is you wonder is and, and I don't know the answer to this, but my guess would be that over time you know that they're not starting out with your foot. Like over time, that that's been something that's been selected for. Right? In a population? Yes.

Speaker 6:          02:11:06       People like height or like he did just like this guy's feet. Yeah. Holy Shit. Holy Shit. We're what we're looking at what looks like frog,

Speaker 3:          02:11:19       but that's not even, that's not even crazy shoe. That's, isn't that a,

Speaker 6:          02:11:23       that's North America people feet and this guy were h u a o r a n I. How do you pronounce that? Harani. I'd have to check where that is. It's bizarre, but it really does show you from fucking wearing shoes your whole life and given the different environment like that. That's insane. Like what we're looking at here, they literally look like thumbs, like they're sticking out of the side, but it's the same structure as a human foot, meaning that it's the same length of toes and just you see that from using it that way. They've just developed this incredible. You know what's really crazy? What is one of the hallmarks of civilization that shows like a really poor choice and footwear when your feet go the other way, when they go in an ineffective direction, they they get, they get that hammertoe and they climb over each other. These is, these people have functional feet to the point where you know they could probably hold something with their feet.

Speaker 3:          02:12:23       Yeah. When I look at a. When I look at my wife's feet, I feel like she's got a foot disease very much shaped by a lifetime of office footwear.

Speaker 6:          02:12:34       It's awful. Especially with women. They get that Hammertoe, that Bunyan thing where their, their toes are kind of crossed over to the center of that thing. Well, it's so weird. It's a weird choice that someone is decided that women should shove their toes into these pointy things.

Speaker 3:          02:12:51       But, but uh, just like with the, that I saw the, a group of individuals lock onto polarized sunglasses as being the shit. Um, I, if you went back in five years, I'm telling you, instead of bringing beaten, being barefoot was gonna be wearing shoes.

Speaker 6:          02:13:12       What if you got those women high heel shoes and said, this is what all the women in the stretch. Of course you could take awhile, but you get. Oh, that's disgusting though. That's foot banding is fucked up right there. That's just insane. Can you tell them, looking at your toes from binding your feet, foot binding in China? Yeah. Well you soft tissue. It's very flexible. So go, uh, go to Cirque du Solei. Look at those people could do their bodies. The human body is pretty bizarre and its ability to adapt, but it,

Speaker 3:          02:13:41       yeah. You know, those groups that used to bind their children's head to that back to flag in your head out,

Speaker 6:          02:13:46       well, how about those people and what part of the world was it a where they have that in the incas, the where they have those lines, the Nazca lines, you know, and they found all these skulls from people back then were they, it stretched their heads out, almost made their heads look like aliens. Yeah, there you go. But, uh, see if you find the Inca Inca skulls, it's so much so that a lot of the really loony people said, look, they're trying to be like the aliens that have come down and given them knowledge and. Oh yeah, yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:14:22       Have you ever been down to, um, do you remember those? They're, they're, they're held in Salta, Argentina. I went to see him one time. But those children, did they found that were in tombed at the top of a mountain and they were basically freeze dried? No, it's perfectly preserved. Children. What would happen to them? Well, they were taken up and given as the offering. So first it seems based on the stuff they had with them that they were prayed through the incan empire and people lavish them with gifts and when they look at the isotopes and their bodies, it's like their diet, their whole lives, they had just had potatoes, but then you can see the, toward the end of their lives, they're very well fed with meat and fish and all kinds of stuff. And they had just innumerable treasures, a gold pieces carved pieces. So they were taking it seems as though they were taken throughout the empire.

Speaker 3:          02:15:15       And what, what's really funny about this, speaking of Columbus earlier is it was like, yeah, so it's like as best they haven't dated exactly. But it seems like, I mean it seems like we're talking about, you know, Columbus 1492. It's like we're talking about 1491. Wow. So the height of this empire at, at the, the height of the empire butting up against it's dramatic and sudden collapse with European contact. But they took a. yeah, I went to see. And um, she was the only, they made a deal with indigenous people where they only put one on display at a time, but she was on display when I was there and what do they have their encapsuled. So they took them, well, I'll tell you how they came to be first. So they were finally dressed, had a lot of ornaments and things with them had been very well fed and the, the older group and they took them out to the high peak, I can't remember how they might've been 14 or 15,000 feet above sea level.

Speaker 3:          02:16:12       And they built a little tune for him and sat him in the tomb. They were drunk, they had a lot of rice wine in their bodies when they died. Uh, the oldest one mostly putting up some kind of struggle because she was hitting the head with a hammer and acts and they were just laid out in this thing and then kept over with rocks and it's very stable environment. So they froze. And then, you know, we use now like backpacking food is freeze dried food. Yeah. They used to have, they used to do a very similar thing with by just taking potatoes and storing them at high elevations were what? Freeze drying is your liquid. It's like you freeze something and then expel the liquid. Where liquid goes from a gaseous [inaudible] goes from a solid to a gas without passing through its liquid state. So when you freeze dry food, you like freeze dry, you put it in a freezer and get super cold and then you start.

Speaker 3:          02:17:09       Then you start putting it under a vacuum to point where all the water goes immediately to a gash state doesn't pass through a liquid state, so it holds its form, but all the water's gone. If it goes to a liquid state, then it collapses, but just hold it's form in the non water. Parts of the cells just stay bound in their natural shape. So they were in this position and eventually just like expelled tons of water without ever thrown out. And when they found them, you can even see the that they had been chewing cocoa leaves because the high elevation, the kids still have dried coca leaves on their lips. Dude, it's wild. Yeah. Me and my wife went there to look at them. Where does it now? It's in Salta, Argentina. Wow. Near the border was very near the border of Bolivia.

Speaker 6:          02:17:55       I wanted to ask you something totally unrelated, but it came up because you've talked about freeze dried foods. I know you cook a lot, but have you ever. I know you eat those mountain house things, but have you ever tried to make your own. Have you ever tried to dehydrate some of your wild game? Oh yeah. I'm dehydrated. I mean anytime you make jerky or dehydrate and stuff, but have you ever made chili and things like that where you could rehydrated in the field trial they've ever made dehydrated?

Speaker 3:          02:18:18       No. I've assembled a lot of dehydrated things, but I've never d like at what point, how many ingredients need to be in something before it becomes like a recipe? [inaudible] couple chemical. That's a recipe. It pemmican that's got two things. Pemmican pulverize meet with liquid fat poured over the top of it. Did you know what that is? No. People. Fuck that up all the time. What feminine is? I've never heard of it before, I don't think so. It'd be like the original road food. You dry meat into Jerky, air-dry a Jerky, then you pull it into what looks like Sawdust and then you take in stirred and liquified fat. I made some from a buffalo kill and I wrote my buffalo book. I made Pemmican from that and I was. And I had it in my fridge. This as an experiment. I kept it for seven years.

Speaker 3:          02:19:07       Survival food that can last 50 years. But that's not pemmican. It's not, it doesn't look like it looks like jerky sticks because it's not pulverized. People just now started all of a sudden call. And like, I'm not saying everybody missed, hardly everybody messes up, but it's like a thing that gets messed up. So, um, what was I getting at? What are asking about? No, I asking you to hydrate or dehydrate a bunch of different things and combined it into a recipe that I then bring with me. The reason I like the reason I used the hydrated food and a lot of backpack hunters use dehydrated food is because I'm. If you have a a, a dish made up of dehydrated ingredients. They have different hydration times. Okay. So if you do beans like, like a piece of meat is going to be digestible to you. My piece of dehydrated meat that's then hydrated is going to be digestible to you. A dehydrated being,

Speaker 4:          02:20:09       yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:20:09       Might take 30 or 40 minutes before it's going to be in a condition and it doesn't rip you apart. If you fuck yourself up, eat straight dried beans. What happens? Just, it's just you're off. Yeah. You don't know. You're someone doesn't know what to do with it, man. Well knows what to do with. It starts producing voluminous amounts of gas, right? It's off, it's horrible. But with, with, if you could, if you take food and cook it to a ready to eat steak

Speaker 3:          02:20:40       and then freeze dry it, it, it, uh, you can rehydrate it Kinda like simultaneously if you do everything right now. One word were like a hamburger, right? If you're hydrated a hamburger and then you add water to it, you're going to wind up with a soggy ass been. So the trick is like finding things that are gonna in a hot water bath are going to all come back to life kind of at the same time. But places that make backpack food out of just dehydrated but not freeze dried ingredients is a recipe for disaster. Really. Some people liked that shit. But for day in, day out consumption, um, I'm a freeze dry man and it's freeze dried. Something you can do at home, you'd have to buy a sublimation chamber. So No. What does the sublimation chamber, what does that look? It's a chamber in which sublimation, you know what it looks like.

Speaker 3:          02:21:28       It looks like the, it looks like a submarine, really small, but it's very heavy duty because we are doing is you're taking, you're taking food, you take ready foods and freeze it. Right? And then you put it into a sublimation chamber and pull a very strong vacuum on it. And the air pressure gets to a point where the liquid cellmates and goes directly to a gas state and you condense it on another surface inside the chamber, but it's out of the food. Then you take the food out and it's like glass. You can shatter it. That's freeze dried food. But it rehydrates in a real nice way. I have heard we a lot of it because we do a lot of back country trips. I've heard everyone's complaints about it, but it's like from my perspective, which I will argue is a well informed perspective.

Speaker 3:          02:22:18       It's like it's the lesser of two evils. It's not that bad for day in, day out consumption. I think that the companies that are do freeze dry it just better in my opinion now when I say that these children are freeze dried, I think some people, you know, people are going to challenge that because it's not technically freeze dried, but like a similar thing going on where they're keeping their form but shedding their water and be shedding water, keeping their form of being frozen and preserved for a long time. So yeah, it's a trip because I was reading a podcast or reading a podcast, listening to a podcast rather with this guy was talking about how he's doing that with his own food, for backpacking trips, dehydrating it. Oh Man. Why not? Things like Chili or things along those lines. It's busy cooking Chili and then dehydrate or just dehydrating the components.

Speaker 3:          02:23:04       Think dehydrated. The components. I think he was talking about dehydrating the meat and dehydrating pasta. Like like something, you know, like taking some meat with sauce and putting it together with the pasta. Now my brother one time, he's a very, a frugal man. He didn't realize is that the right word? He just hates a to see food, go to waste. He one time had a bunch of roommates and they all moved out and left a ton of rice and you got sick of cooking rice because it takes too long. He cooked all the rice and then spread it out on sheets and dehydrated it and is a hydrator and, and, and, and reverse engineered instant rice.

Speaker 3:          02:23:45       That's insane. Does it take that long? What does rice tastes like? Twenty minutes? It seems like it takes more time to do that talk to him. So this is the same guy. Is this the same guy that found the hobos underwear and stole it? Yup. And the same guy that, um, one time our, our dear, late friend was getting married and uh, his bride, his bride at the wedding was at his bride to b's House and a neighbor was away on vacation and the neighborhood was away on vacation, said, you know, since we're out of town, if you guys want to use our home for some of your wedding guests, go ahead. And so all the groomsmen were lodged up in this house of this man. We didn't know who was a neighbor of his wife's parents. And uh, I don't know why, but my brother got the snooping around and this guy freezer and found that he had, had.

Speaker 3:          02:24:40       He had a bull elk in there that had been in there for seven years and he had like this crisis, this moral crisis where he's trying to figure out, is it morally worse to steal or morally worse to allow this man to waste this meet? How long was it built? We'll book stay. Good. If you freeze it, you were fucking pushing it. A seven years. Seven years. Like what is what is commonly agreed upon? It depends who you ask. If you asked me the way I treat trim, the way I cut trim and rap, I don't even blink at two years. Two years is fine. Yeah. The way I cut trim and rap. But when you start seeing for years, you get a little weird. Well, a thing that I don't let it go. I, I've never done it. I would have to think it's going to start to go [inaudible] the texture, the texture will change.

Speaker 3:          02:25:27       The texture will change. Um, seven years. There's two things going on. One, you're borderline until you're starting to get the idea that this guy isn't gonna eat that thing, right? Yeah. So he waited out in his head and when he left he had a bunch of that meet with them and took them home and aid because he just hated to see, uh, oh. Outgoing waste. How did it tastes? Seven years old. I remember we did the ask them. Wow. But his standard of good is different than your standard, his standard of good as acceptable in cases like that. So here's a weird crisis though. It makes sense. But he, throughout his whole life, he always is running into these situations like where he cannot, he cannot let food go to waste. So he's like, if I talk to him right now, there's probably 10 more things like that that have happened to them since I talked to him last where he's like, when he found like he found in his alleyway one time and he living in Montana and still lives in my town living in Bozeman founder and his alleyway, like a discarded a discarded cash from a homeless man and ate all that guys food.

Speaker 3:          02:26:29       And he was a phd candidate at the university.

Speaker 3:          02:26:35       You grew up with them. So I've ever understand him. The first time he, here's where he kind of like, we're not where it came from, but he drew a bear tag when we were in Michigan and it was hard to get a bear take at the time. And he drew a bear tag. And the only way to hunt bears and the ups is like, you know, you're not, you're not going to spot stock him because it's flat ground and you can't see shit. Right? Oh, you use dogs. Are you gonna use bait. There's. You never see a bear. So he started to bait pound way. He was feeding his bait pile ahead of the season was just dumpster diving. So as he's dumpster diving, it's like he's living off. Not only is he baiting the bear with the dumpster food, but he's like living off the dumpster dive and food that he found to because he liked, discovered this great richmond November him.

Speaker 3:          02:27:21       He found on that shit. He found this big box of boxes of expired bugles. You know those little crackers? Yeah. The people like put cheese with shoot Cheez whiz into the open ended that bugle. And I've got a picture of him. He just walking the walk through the woods with boxes of bugles under his arm and get out. And he'd be like dumping them out for the bear and just eating the vehicles to. And then he'll walk back with a handful of bugles, just hate to see wasted food. His old girlfriend had a job cooking like the brown food and the Albertson's, you know, like the display case where they fry all it was like burritos and shit. And um, they were, she was bringing all that home and they were living off the food that was going to the garbage and they came to her and said, you can't steal this food. And then she started stealing it quietly. Wow. He can't stand to see food go to waste. Well that's probably noble, you know, it's extra nice is he works for the Usta. So it's good to know that a person like that is involved and um, you know,

Speaker 6:          02:28:22       is at least in the room with people who are thinking about food systems. Is it good? Because it seems like you'll fucking anything dude. He will. He's on a different level, on a different level of toughness and shit. He's the guy who was arm and shrinking because morale is trying to hook you up with. Yes. Yeah. He's got a gun. Did he do anything about that? Nope. Oh Jesus, that's not good. No. Once you get that atrophy, it's a very tough to get it back. The ways nerves regenerate takes a long time. It's like a half an inch a year. He chronicles. It's decay by taking a. he's got a 30 pound a kettle bell and he, he was chronicling his decay by watching how many just tricep. So County Hmi, tricep curls. He could do it. That kettlebell with one arm, one with the other. And I think last time we were talking to him it was 30 or something like 30 on one side and 10 on the other side.

Speaker 6:          02:29:21       Oh Jesus, that's bad. So, uh, that's a neck issue then he's like a c, three or c four or something like that. He's gone, he's gone. He hasn't, I shouldn't say he hasn't done anything about it. He's probably, if he's listening to this, he's probably cringing because he would feel that he has. But I'm tell him if he's listening this a couple things you need to do. If it's, it seems to me like it's a neck issue because, uh, when, when you start getting elbows and things where your arm starts atrophying, usually it's a cervical disc which is somewhere up in here. Um, what, what he should do is get a neck decompression device. They're very, they're inexpensive. They hook over a door, you put it on with Velcro, you strap it, and I have one, uh, it, it hangs on a thing. It's like you're hanging yourself by your Chin may get some room in there for all those nerves.

Speaker 6:          02:30:10       Exactly. And well, same principles, these toes spreading out. And then other also toasts, smashing up. You can kind of soft tissue, stretch out your neck and decompress all those areas. A lot of people have it from bad posture. A lot of people have from athletics. I got it from Jujitsu, from all this, you know, getting your neck yanked on. See that thing right there, that lady has. Yeah, that's a shitty one because that one's working on a bag of water that doesn't work with a neck like mine. You need, you need to be able to hang on, hang on rhino on the other. I had a, I have a thing where I go like, just click, click, click, click, click, click, click, and then I let myself hang from my neck. And um, it's just like that, just like that. See how that guy's just sitting there reading a magazine and you can adjust that.

Speaker 6:          02:30:56       So there's a little, a cord. It's tough to see in this photo, but there's a cord you pull sorta like a plunger on. When I was old school toilets, he pulled that click, click, click, click, click, click, click CEO. He's pulling it right there. Yep. And then you just relax and you just gotta learn how to go with it and sort of relaxed. And it feels weird at first because a lot of pressure but it's pulling your neck literally pulling your neck. You can feel. Sometimes when I'm really relaxed I feel like pop. I feel like something pop little tissue separation's in there. Does it have, do you feel that it's gotten better longterm? Oh yeah, for sure. And it feels like really relaxing, like after it's over I feel like, oh, I feel like it just takes a weight off of, you know, I think there's a tremendous amount.

Speaker 6:          02:31:36       I think sitting is terrible. These, these seats that we're in right now are exceptional because they're ergonomic chairs. You use them right if you use them. Right. I'm pretty cautious about sitting up straight. But from back injuries I've been very, very cautious about working out all the muscles around my back, which I didn't really. I just worked out and figure those things to take care of themselves. Now are treat them as like a, just like brushing my teeth, like my spinal column and all those supporting muscles in the spine. Those are huge. They need, they need to be exercised. And especially if you do anything, like you guys pack out a lot of weight. Yeah. That's a big one. And that's where he feels that he had SCIATICA. Right? That's lower. That's a yard. That was a different thing. But he, he, he knows he liked traces that to a specific animal that he's packing out.

Speaker 6:          02:32:32       Make sense? Because Sciatica is, what's Attica is, is a disc that's bulging, meaning the disc, the soft tissue in between the two hard bones is pushing out and it's pressing up against the nerve and causes pain that shoots down your ass and your lower legs and a lot of people don't even recognize it as a lower back issue because maybe their back is not really that painful, but the last leg in the ass as painful, what the fuck is going on here? I had a similar issue with my neck where it was pushing on my older nerve and I was getting this elbow pain and I was like, fuck, this really hurts, like down my arm and in the back of my tricep. And then I started getting numbness in my fingers and that's when I started figuring out what was going on. Then I went to a doctor, I went to a chiropractor first, which is a fucking giant mistake.

Speaker 6:          02:33:19       I spent a year, but do not believe in chiropractors. I don't believe in chiropractors at all. I think it's 98 percent horseshit. That's what I think. And um, I don't know, but I think chiropractors that are smart, they incorporate things that I think are beneficial, cold, laser massage, a lot of different things. But I think that manipulation that they do, unless you have like some sort of significant scoliosis or something, they're attempting to slowly put back into position. I think most of the time it's just popping your neck and it just feels good. But I just like in an immediate sense, I went to a guy that's a very nice guy and he was trying to tell me that I didn't have a bulging disc because he was pushing down on the top of my head and it didn't hurt. I'm like, okay. So I was listening to him.

Speaker 6:          02:34:02       I listened to this guy for like a fucking year. I had treatment with him and I still have these neck problems and back problems. And then finally I got an MRI and they're like, yeah, you got a bulging disc. And I remember being angry. I remember being angry because I was angry that I was being treated by who is a professional that really didn't know what the fuck they were talking about and they were treating something that was a significant issue that I was experiencing a real deterioration of my function, pain. I wasn't able to do Jujitsu correctly. There was a lot of a lot of problems that I was dealing with. I was like, well, what the fuck is this? Like how to? And then I started talking to doctors about it and when you have a bulging disc man, they want to cut you open like like European, Jada, and you got to golden silence.

Speaker 6:          02:34:44       That's a thing that my bros talking about is the procedure. He's very nervous about a procedure that he could or could not do well for some people it's not a bad move depending on whether or not your brother's willing to do all the different things that can, but he's got a lot of atrophy already, which is a real bad thing is noticeable. Yeah. That's not good because that shit doesn't grow back. Yeah. Bas rutten has it real bad boss route and former UFC heavyweight champion. He fucked his neck up and went through a bunch of different treatments and then eventually wound up getting fused. He's got a, uh, I believe two discs in, maybe more in his neck fused together where he doesn't have any disc tissue. They just screw the bones and together and remove the disc tissue and stabilize the area, but his right arm is significantly smaller than his left arm to the point where he calls it baby arm and this is a former UFC heavyweight champion of the world.

Speaker 6:          02:35:37       And what's ironic is that Sullivan came from fighting, but the last thing came from doing a stunt on sons of anarchy. He was a, in some sort of a fight believer, sons of anarchy, some sort of a fight scene where they were doing some things and some guy was supposed to like throw them on the ground. He landed on his head. So all of that actual flight. And then you get fucked up, pretend fight. And it's bad man. I mean, he's slowly starting to come back, but I've known boss to have this issue for a we. We worked together on a movie before my seven year old daughter was born and he had the issue then and so for seven years and still now does. It still does. It's coming back slowly. But when I'm talking about is like, I think there's some that like the way that your nerves regenerate is extremely slow.

Speaker 6:          02:36:29       They can deteriorate quickly. Like the attribute can happen pretty quick, but the way it regenerates is extremely slow. So they say once you have atrophy, you're fucked. Like you gotta act on it right away. That's the thing they told me when I had lyme disease. Is that a thing that fucks you up as the nerve damage? Yeah, and then people peep. Allow people to think that they always have it. Put the like you had a thing. It's treated, it's gone, but it will live with you for so long because of the damage to your nerves. It's just so slow to recuperate. I talked to a doctor about lyme disease and he said, it's not just a lyme disease you're dealing with said lyme disease is this overall term. He said, you can get a tick that has 100 pathogens in it. When you look at that list of Shit, it gets scary.

Speaker 6:          02:37:14       It's scary as fuck, and they connected it to more jealous. Do you know what more gentleman's is? No challenge challenges a disease that a lot of times they think of psychosomatic because there is some sort of a neuro toxicity involved in lyme disease and all these people that have more jealous, a almost without a doubt have lyme disease as well and wouldn't. More gallons is is they have they start itching it themselves and they think they have fibers growing out of their body and they start hallucinating. Well, most most of the time it's treated as a psychosomatic disorder. Like they'll get carpet fibers in their body and they'll claim these carpet fibers are coming out of their body and growing others jail. But I talked to this doctor who was the only loose, had person that's sort of explained it to me because he's a doctor and he has more jealous and he was saying, and he also has lyme disease and he says to a person, they all have lyme disease, uh, that he's encountered at least, but he was saying that he was looking at himself in the mirror and he saw something moving across the surface of his eye and he knew it was a hallucination and he realized it was a hallucination as a doctor, as an educated man and medicine and still was seeing it and was freaking out.

Speaker 6:          02:38:18       And then that. And then he realized, oh, there's some sort of an extreme neurotoxic effect that this stuff has, you know. And then he started doing like some pretty deep investigation into what constitutes lyme disease. And he's like, well, it's not like, you know, you know, you have herpes, you know. No, it's not like that. Because like you get bit by something, you got a bunch of shit in that cocktail of whatever that disgusting tickets carrying around. And it's variable. You know, you might get it from one part of the east coast and it has, you know, 50 things, you might get it from another as 13 things and, but he's saying with the people that have more gentleman's what he believes is they're suffering from hallucinations brought on by lyme disease.

Speaker 3:          02:38:56       That's, that's the thing about lying that I found was, um, about medicine and about people and about mysterious diseases. Like I quit doing it now, but I would get in arguments with people were like, I was trying to deal with it and finding out about it. And people were telling me like, here's what's happening to me. I'm like, well no, I was told that's not how it works because there's so much a scent that you bring up earlier about a doctor or chiropractor telling you the wrong thing. There's so much, um, subject, subjectivity in the fucking medical world that it's like on one hand all these people were sort of going through this, uh, this regimen, this educational regimen, which is, you know, it's like there's like government oversight. There's certain criteria you need to meet, right? Things needed to pass. And you think you already sort of like have this unifying effect, but people come out on the other end who have gone through kind of the same educational system telling you fuck with wildly different shit. Yeah, wildly different shit about the problems where one guy like you could walk in, one guy's going to do a surgery and the next day I was like, oh, no way.

Speaker 6:          02:40:06       Yeah. Who was been in his balls? Who was it wasn't Steevo right? Who the fuck was it? Said that San Antonio. I think Andrew Santina. He was telling me that he went to. He had assistant his balls and he thought he had bowel cancer, went to a doctor and one doctor told him that he has excess come stored up in his balls, sperm that stored up in his balls and that's what's causing this not. He went home to his wife and said he went to another doctor now he wasn't married at the time. He was young man that went head. And the second doctor said, who the fuck was that doctor? That guy should lose his ability to practice like you don't get calm stored up in your balls and it makes some sort of a not like he's saying, who told you this? A fucking real practicing doctor told him that.

Speaker 3:          02:40:57       Yeah. I used to go into it when I was younger. I'd go into it thinking it was like going to those like going to get an oil change, right? You could have 20 people in there. All good. Change your oil like the same way. What we do is we drain it and put new shit in. I'm like, great, now I realize that Mr. fucking roll the dice man. Roll the dice and here's what you're going to try to mitigate that by doing some research, but it really is like, I'll have the guys going to tell him he's not gonna. Tell me the same thing there guys. Gonna tell me. The big thing

Speaker 6:          02:41:24       comes to health and this is one of the things that I have a big problem with when it comes to anything dealing with the back is preventative maintenance is like one of the most important things for back health. We're sitting in desks all day and most people are not sitting up straight. They're not sitting a book. Good thing. It's like one of those balls, those Jim balls was big balance balls. Those are great to sit on because they forced you to kind of stabilize yourself and use your core muscles or some sort of an ergonomic chair forcing you to stabilize, but doctor's not telling you, hey man, you got to take a yoga class a couple days a week. You got to do something to straighten out your posture. You got to do something to make sure that your spine is strong enough to be caring about. You can't slump forward because you're putting undue pressure on these different portions of your back.

Speaker 6:          02:42:07       Is that a significant amount of doctors are just not fucking telling you that. They were like, Oh yeah, your disc is bulging. We're going to have to do a disectomy. No worries. It's outpatient is outpatient procedure, but then not telling you is they're. They're chopping off of a chunk of this finite material. There's a small amount of material that separates your discs and when they talk about, oh, I have disc degenerative disorder, it's a disease, my disc, no stop. It's not a disease. What's going on is you're compressing your body through weightlifting through extreme exercise. Your body is slowly getting smushed down. You're not allowing it to recover. You're not stretching it out. You're not strengthening all those core muscles. You're not giving it some time off. You're probably engaging the same damaging activity over and over again and toughing it out. If there's one thing you should never fucking tough out, it's a back issue. Anytime there's something going on with your back, don't tough it out. Don't try to work through it, just don't because you're going to fuck it up worse, and then it's going to get to a point where it just does not recover it and then you're going to have to get surgery.

Speaker 3:          02:43:07       This is all. This is making me super self conscious about how I like Larry King, man

Speaker 6:          02:43:12       so bad, a chair and I used to much more. I do try to sit up as much as I can now, but these chairs have been here. I went away for a couple of days trying to sit straighter, staring at you, sitting all nice for three hours. I try, man. I didn't always used to be good at it. I used to slump quite a bit before I had back issues. I got to catch up. These chairs are called a capisce co chairs there from Ergo depot. Um, you can get an Ergo depot.com and get these fucking things. So the shit they're, they're comfortable enough to sit in to. I've been on, some of them were your knees slide in and there's a pad against your Shin? Those are kind of gross. These seem much more like an actual chair, but they're super comfortable. What's it called? It's called a cup hisco.

Speaker 6:          02:43:55       So that's a good drink. I know. Ergo depot.com. No, they didn't pay me to say that, but these things are the shit backs. Man's vacs or the one thing like when people have these heavy packouts and everybody likes to pride themselves on 150 pounds. Seven miles. You don't. I'm telling. I'm prone to saying those kinds of things. I tell everybody packed, take 75 and do it twice. Police and even, that's a lot, man. I have this new thing that I go. Why do people, why do they like to talk about? Because you want to be bad asses. Yeah. But you'd never be like, yeah man. I jumped out from the truck and just joke the way right in time will tell their friends to, you know Mike, he packed out to elk quarters on his back. Dude, Dude's a fucking savage and I got [inaudible] probably going to have no legs.

Speaker 6:          02:44:40       Dude's a fucking dumb ass. Fucking legs are gonna stop working. Probably like got a massive bulge in his back. No, I, I'm guilty because I, uh, I traffic in those stories and when I hear those stories I'm like, right on, Bro. Well, you know how hard it is. That's why when you've done a pack out, a real packout, you know, uh, hardest, I remember when we shot that mule deer right there in Montana and we only walked like, what was it, two miles maybe, and we had the meat split up between like three of us, so it was probably only like 50 pounds on everybody's back. And I was like, Holy Shit. Once he finally got to camp two miles pretty, pretty flat. It wasn't that hilly. Yeah. If you're not accustomed to this exhausting. Yeah. So if you're not accustomed to getting bit by bs six times a day, it's overwhelming.

Speaker 6:          02:45:27       So I should tell people that, uh, the outdoorsman, I know a company that you liked their products as well. They make an atlas trainer now it's a salary. You were messing with that fucking grind. You gotta wait, you put out? Yeah. It's like an Olympic late slides in post and it clamps down. I thought maybe you rig that up yourself. No, no, they're selling it now. It's their thing. I saw that. Yeah, that I thought it was like you. I thought you'd gone down to the hardware store. I knew I knew the frame, but I didn't recognize the. I know guys do it, but usually they use sand bags, put sand bags in their backpack and get used to. It makes a big difference and it's an incredible work and it doesn't shift. Doesn't shift at all and you really lock it in place. You don't have the risk of like tweaking, right?

Speaker 6:          02:46:08       Like it's strength, but it's not. Because when you shits wiggling around, then it like, I don't know if it doesn't really make you stronger, it makes you more inclined to like, fuck something up and yeah. To twist funny. Yeah. No, I agree. You know, but I just think poor people just please just, just exercise your back, treat it like it's like brushing your teeth just to take yoga. You don't have to take anything. Just get some youtube videos. They're free, they're available everywhere. Just do something to strengthen your back. You will prevent. Most people don't want to listen to this and they're not going to do it because people are lazy as fuck. But you will prevent a host of issues that people have just by exercising your back. Simple stuff there. There's the atlas trainer right there. Yeah. You could do chin ups on if you're a fucking savage.

Speaker 6:          02:46:48       Like this guy is an animal. But um, yeah, you could carry up to 90 pounds that thing. So it will take to a pedophile, take 100 pound plates to under just don't know if the plates designed for it. If the pack or others designed for it, that's a good idea to do. Pull up that sumbitch on. Yeah. I use a weight belt, put like a belt and a hang a kettle bell in between my legs. I put a 50 pound Kettlebell on a chain and I do chin ups like that. Really? That's hanging where it's right between my legs, like it's a big leather straps fall across your legs in between the straps on my back or my hip like this. And then there's like a chain in between my legs and the Kettlebell hangs in which we might legs. But it's not getting your scroll at all.

Speaker 6:          02:47:28       No, no, no, no. Swinging low swing. It got gotta, make sure your legs are separated so it's not cracking against your knees, but you know when you're doing chin ups, it's just hanging there. No Shit. Yeah, they say that that's the best way to get more reps in with your chin ups is not to try like 1920. The actually the best way is do less, but with heavy weights do like a, you know, put a weight vest on or hang a 70 pound kettle bell in between your legs. Just that three or four. But again, you run the risk of injury because it's your. Maybe that's why I've never done it. Yeah, you're putting a lot. You've got to build yourself up to it, you know, that's what also one of the big things that happens to people when they start to exercise and they just try to go too hard too.

Speaker 6:          02:48:09       They go to full balls is a, as I remember, uh, uh, various times not running for long time and they'd be like, yeah, I'm going to start running and growing a five mile run. I've been running now for just a little over a month. I got a friend who's a runner and I'm like, he, he's a hobbyist but runs marathons and he never did before, but he was saying he was talking, he wrote, he's a writer, so he's been writing about that a little bit and he was saying he just wrote a piece about you don't run to get in shape. You gotta get shaped. Then start running. Yeah, that's a good idea to smart. We say there's some steps. There's some. If you're just like a Slob, right? There's some things you need to get taken care of before you embark on that smart ground. There's groundwork that needs to be done to get ready for the run.

Speaker 6:          02:49:02       I talked to. I don't like to ever discourage people from doing Jujitsu, but I talked to a buddy of mine who just did Jujitsu from. He's 43 years of slaving behavior, no exercise whatsoever other than the occasional pickup basketball game for like seven years, and then he started doing Jujitsu and immediately his body's falling apart. I'm like, okay, I know this is going to be hard for you to do, but if you really want to do it, you got to get in shape first. Just start out with grassland and got into our Rathlin. Steven Rinella. You got to get out of here at 3:15. Listen man, you got one of the best podcasts in the world. It's fucking awesome. I love listening to it. I'm so happy you do it and I think you've got the best hunting show ever, so I owe the podcast, all of you, Joe Rogan.

Speaker 6:          02:49:47       Well, listen, man, hanging out with you. Look so easy for you. You, you have so many great stories and you such a good talker. I was like, how the fuck does this guy not have a podcast? I'm glad you steered me in that direction. Thanks for the plug. I'm glad you're still doing it. It's called a mediator podcast. It's available everywhere and a mediator is available on Netflix and uh, right now it's only. How many seasons do you get? Five and six seasons. Five and six. Five there will will have more. We've got more. We got a dozen episodes that are new that we're going to be released, so just stay tuned and then I, you know, months ago, back in a couple months ago, if you go to my instagram, Steven Rinella, you'll scroll back and find a bunch of pictures from. You'll find a bunch of Guyana photos. Yeah, amazing stuff from Guyana, but we never even talked about. We did talk about that. You'll find the pictures. Good Times. Thanks for doing this, man.
