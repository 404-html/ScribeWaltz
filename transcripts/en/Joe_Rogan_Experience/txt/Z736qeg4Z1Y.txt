Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Five, four, three, two.

Speaker 2:          00:00:07       Yes.

Speaker 3:          00:00:10       Hello Hannibal. What's up man? How are you sir? I'm good. Good to see you. Good to see you too. You have notes? Yeah. I don't know. So I just wanted to be prepared. I had, I've had notes other times but I just didn't have them written down. You know what all you had to like get in your head. I had him in my head but I'm an older man now.

Speaker 2:          00:00:28       Do you mind starting to slip away? Mine started to slip away so I had some notes and drink it. Alpha brain. And you've got notes. Yeah. Dude, you're ready. What's her notes? What do you want to talk about? What's going on? Oh, we don't have to get right into it.

Speaker 3:          00:00:45       Naturally. It was just more for like, you know, sometimes if stuff leg or something or if I feel like I don't have something right. And then a peak at it real quick. Oh, okay. Right now we fresh. Oh, we're fresh. Good to see you too, man. Yeah. Sorry about Monday. Oh no worries man. Shit happens. I just did not. I was still in New York. I just had booked my flight in the morning and I just could not go. You just couldn't do. It was just too tired. I was, it wasn't just a tidy, was just more of a. just didn't feel like going. He was just a like to to. It was the five hour thing and I did it today. Actually. I flew in today, but it was just that sometimes you just don't want to do it. It was just that flight. I was like, oh, I don't know if that's the beautiful thing about being a young, successful single man. You can do whatever the fuck you want to do. It was A. Yeah. Yeah. But I'm uh, excited to be back where it got weird last time.

Speaker 2:          00:01:48       Oh, here. Yeah. Last time. Was the Sam Harris One, right? That's, that's been a year. Oh yeah, that's right. Yeah. That did get a little weird alcohol. Alcohol is a motherfucker. It's amazing. It's legal.

Speaker 3:          00:02:00       It is, it's amazing. It's like, what else? It was just A. Yeah, I should have. I should've went to the comedy store

Speaker 2:          00:02:09       was. I still did do, yeah. Did a terrible set dj. Well, we got trouble set. We did a podcast. I got drunk. And then you hung around for the second podcast. Yeah. You said sit in, sit in. It was Sam Harrison. Who else was it?

Speaker 3:          00:02:27       It was, uh, the guy whose podcast it is.

Speaker 2:          00:02:31       Oh, Josh Zap. Zap, Zap. He fucking loved it. Of course it got crazy. But yeah, he loved the controversy, but you could see it was kind of gross even though I love Josh. You could see it while I was going on. They loved it. Yes, yes, yes, yes. He was. Yeah. He enjoyed it when you were teasing it out too, because I started getting messages. What is this crazy Hannibal? Sam Harris.

Speaker 3:          00:02:53       So I'm like, what the fuck is going on? Because I knew once I left I was like, yeah, that's going to be some weird shit in. And I was fine it. But then

Speaker 2:          00:02:59       I kept on getting messages, like, what is this? When is that coming out? And everybody saw it live, didn't they? No, they didn't. It was not a. right, because it was Josh Zaps podcast wasn't mine. Oh, that's right. Yeah, Fun Times. Fun Time. Last time steps was here. He was talking about killing babies. Remember that? Yeah. It was talking about like maybe she'll be able to board a baby six months after it's born. I was like, what the fuck are you talking about man? You. Did he have notes? No, no, no. See that's what he hasn't prepared. You don't have no notes. She was like, yeah, let's kill alive babies. Let's talk about it. Gay dudes feel very differently about babies. Like they can't make them as long as they're doing only gay things. There's no babies being made. So like, so detached from the idea of a baby.

Speaker 2:          00:03:46       Did you think that Taylor? I don't know. I'm just telling you that shit. Did he have strong points? No. Straight up. Killed a baby who's just being controversial. Okay. No, he, I think he enjoys controversy. Yeah. Yeah. Click Bait. Hey, if you're not a comedian, that's a good way to get attention. Clickbait. What else do you have? You know, I mean, everybody can have a good point, right? You know, like can you yell about it? Well, if. Yeah, can you make a meme about it? I mean we're, we're our whole society, like our news runs on click bait now. It's getting more and more slippery. You know, me and my friends would call everything fake news now. Call each other fake news like, yeah, I'm going back and forth with the Ra and Bert and Thompson girl because they wrote some article about Bert Kreischer and Bert is gonna swear off of Booze for 90 days?

Speaker 2:          00:04:40       Yeah, this is the new bed. He's going to run a marathon and swear off booze for 90 days with. Okay. I don't believe it. Where's he at now? Has He started yet? He gets drunk every day. That's what the point. You're going to die like amy winehouse. That's how amy winehouse died. Yeah, that's what I said, man, that's rough. You can't. You gotta be like, no, you got to be honest with your friends. Like going to die. Like amy winehouse can just go cold Turkey. I told them to lay off. I go, you've got to wean off the booze. No. Heroine, heroin. You die like that. No, no, no, no, no, no. You just get the shakes and you feel like shit, but heroin, you could live. Booze is one of the rare drugs that will kill you if you drop it cold Turkey if you're an alcoholic.

Speaker 2:          00:05:23       But do you think. I think there's a difference between heavy drinker. Oh yeah. Alcohol. Oh, well, yeah. Casual Boozer, you know, like if you booze, like maybe if you have like two or three drinks at night and then quit cold Turkey will be fine. But if you're one of those all day drinkers. Yeah. And then you quit cold Turkey, you will die. It's very common. It's a, it's one of the more common drugs that you die. I think there's, um, there's a like Benzos, those, those will kill you from withdrawal. There's a few different pharmaceuticals. It'll kill you from withdrawal,

Speaker 4:          00:05:58       but I don't believe heroines on that list. I think it's very rare that people die from heroin withdrawal or they get really sick.

Speaker 3:          00:06:06       You know, Carl Hart is Dr Carl Hart, the famous doctor who is trust all doctors with just two syllables in it. Full name.

Speaker 4:          00:06:14       Well, he's got dreadlocks. He trusted me more. It's cool. Um, but he, uh, he's a very, very interesting doctor because he talks about like drug use and drug with. He's like, for first of all, one of the things that he points out, it was like, oh, let's talk about a drug free society. It's like there's never been one. He goes, there's never been one. There's never been a drug for you and you don't normally want it. He goes when it comes to whether it's caffeine or alcohol and then pharmaceutical drugs, things that help people. He's like, we have this. We decided to demonize certain drugs and he's like, the drugs you've got to be worried about like alcohol's ones carries once because if you quit cold Turkey, if you're a hardcore drinker and you drink and all the time

Speaker 3:          00:06:52       you'll fucking die. Look baby cough syrup to wean yourself off or something like that. I don't think it helps. I don't think it activates the same part of your brain. You know, I was talking to a photographer, I was at this festival this weekend and she had a, uh, a film camera, you know, do you develop your fifth? She's, oh no, you can only develop black and white because if you develop your color pitches, the fumes, well it'll knock you right out. And so I said, so just a little bit of that would be a great time. It's a small, so just get a little bit of that and you can just huffing paint. Yeah, you can do a Goddamn job interview it. Maybe just a little bit of touch, just like crack a vial in front of Mike, grow dose of a little bit of that.

Speaker 3:          00:07:46       Have you ever tried poppers? Poppers are those little things where if they crack and they sniff it. Emile nitrate to thing it's called. No, I did whip us in college. Oh yeah, I did that when I worked at a creamery. I worked at Newport creamery. It was like a ice cream place and they had a there. The ice cream was a big vats that what is the gas? Nitrous oxide oxide, right? Yeah, that's what it is. Yeah. And we would, uh, we would do like socks off of it. That kills a lot of brands. That kills a lot of brands. I remember I did one weekend in college and then I think I did it on a Friday night and on the Sunday I was just walking on. I don't know if I was forced into Yale just because I was trying to justify how I felt or if it was a natural yell, but yelling was happening. Wow. Yeah, and you couldn't help it. I don't know, something you ever just tweak out by yourself. Just you ever. You never did. You absolutely do. After like a crazy workout after work, I'm usually spent a week out do Carter at the

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       way in. Was just tweaking out, but it was for show. So tell you, put a show for yourself. Change your state of mind just by yourself. Yeah. Like people say, if you smile, change your mind. Right? It will change the way your brain actually feels. Well, if you freak out, it probably does that too, right? Yeah, yeah, definitely. There's ways to do it. I mean why wildwood Indians, native Americans, when they would do those, those battle cries.

Speaker 3:          00:09:20       Why else are they doing that? Getting fired up? You get hyped up by yelling or singing a song. Viking. Is that a New Zealand New Zealand, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. Where they, uh, they will play this video of them playing the USA team. Oh yeah. And they're doing this elaborate thing they're doing. It's very elaborate and just energetic and they cut to the USA team and they're kind of looking back, Kinda just con. Not Confused, but just what's going on. And they went through this whole thing. Is this right here? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:09:57       And they didn't a basketball game. Basketball, some volume. This is ridiculous.

Speaker 5:          00:10:01       Basketball and dusted by 45 points. You're playing NBA superstars. You fucked the dummies, but it's just for the culture. That's what they do all the time. But it's. But it's just, it seems so stupid. It seems stupid if you. Have you played basketball and stupid? No, I think if you. It's a performance art,

Speaker 2:          00:10:32       like the, the other players clapped. Clapped like good, good job. Children. And then that game. What was the final score that game? One hundred million to zero. Is that what it was weird. If you do all of that and then you're asking kit kid, that's, that is one of the most unfair things every day like nba superstars play in the Olympics. That is so fucked up. It was in our country country, but it's so fucked up. It's so fucked up. It's like, look, Andre Ward was an Olympic gold medalist, but if you let him boxing the Olympics right now, it will be so fucked up. It's just wrong.

Speaker 3:          00:11:09       Well, because, uh, just way better than the box in the Olympics. They don't let the professionals. Is it an age cap? It

Speaker 2:          00:11:17       was, it just. No, it's just, I don't think they allow professionals where, although that whole professional nonprofessional things very, very weird now, especially now that they let nba players play, you know, because like there was always talk of that. Like when they were talking about doing that, like it was back when Mike Tyson was a champion. Then we're like, well, what the fuck? What have you let Mike Tyson box the Olympics. Good luck.

Speaker 3:          00:11:38       Well, the, the players from the other teams I pros to. Yeah, I mean the, the uh, whenever that other countries, well, Spain had some solid plans and some of them are NBA players. Paula, all marcus saw a rudy guns [inaudible], a couple of other players that played in the NBA.

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       Australia actually put up a, a decent team. They got bogut. Maybe Patty Mills, I might be fucking out, but they have a handful of, a handful of pros from other countries and in those pro leagues that have been competitive against but not those guys, which there's pros and then there's American pros when it comes to basketball, there's no competition. It's kind of a joke, isn't it? It's getting close for a second for a little bit. Skinny Spain and Spain has some guys and spans a bunch of guys in the league. So it's within Spain plays a USA. It's basically like some NBA players playing against other nba players, you know what I mean? Versus random dudes. It instead of it being random dudes from Spain, it's actually, you know, they might be playing, one of the guys on USA might be playing against one of their real NBA teammates.

Speaker 2:          00:12:49       Interesting. Yeah. The rules are a little different to a international basketball. What's the, what's the difference? For instance, you can go 10, but once the ball hits the rim, you can swat it off and an MBA and an all American basketball pretty much. You can't even touch the ball if it's anywhere close to the rim or above it. It's like a. that's a whole act like that's a whole extra rule if you're like, if you're a seven foot tall, right. You can just snatch the ball every time I get to near the room. Basically. It's a couple of other little small ones like bumping into. It's interesting how other countries used to used to be a noncompetitive in certain sport. Like boxing is a perfect example. For the longest time, like the American boxers were head and shoulders above the rest of the world. Then?

Speaker 2:          00:13:27       Yeah, like especially like in the heavyweight division, it wasn't even close there. Like there was Henry Cooper who hurt Muhammad Ali real bad. That was an interesting story. This is back on. Muhammad Ali was still cassius clay before he became a home and wait, and Henry Cooper was like the big English heavyweight and he rocked Mohammed Ali with a left hook and you know what Angelo Dundee did. He cut Muhammad Ali's gloves. He went back to the corner and he sliced his gloves and he's like, Hey, we got to change these gloves. These gloves are fucked up. So they bought them all this time. They had an oh shit. Yeah, they had an undo the tape, get another pair of gloves, like the cut his fucking gloves because that's the type of tricks you can do in the sixties. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah. That's what they did. But he, if you ever see the fight, he got cracked like more than he ever got cracked in his entire career.

Speaker 2:          00:14:18       But Google Henry Cooper a rocks Mohammed Ali. And so Mohammed Ali, it wasn't Muhammad Ali was Cassius clay back then, so he drops him with like the perfect left hook that was his big punch to and Ali just crashes down to his ass and he's like out and they, they gave them all sorts of time. He went back to the corner, they cut the gloves, they took the gloves off, then he went back and got new gloves. They had to, they sliced slices, gloves open with a razor blade, sliced him about 10 minutes. This whole lot of time. Anytime. A lot of time because they had to get gloves, you know, they don't have gloves is waiting.

Speaker 3:          00:14:57       What was a. I Wonder what the commentators stall game was. See it right here. What are these guys used to stolen right

Speaker 2:          00:15:03       here. Boom. Oh yeah. Like he is fucking out. Got His rock and it's end of the round. The very end of the rounds. Boom. I mean as a perfect left hook. It just got sat down. He's in deep trouble. So there's two things happen. One is the end of the round. See? He's like really out of it here. Like Shit. Yeah, they're throwing water on him and then when they go back they're like, oh, you know, oh, so they cut it out of this. They don't show. They changed the gloves. So he's super fresh year and he wound up to be stopping Henry Cooper by cut. See if there's a clip of the glove changing. That's funny. It's like, this is a Mike Tyson's old train. Not old trainer, but old manager. Goddammit. I forget his name, but he was a boxing historian and he put together all of these videos and he used to do the voiceover for a lot of these videos to like right when custom Otto died.

Speaker 2:          00:16:06       Him and Shelly Finkel took over. God Damn it. What the fuck is his name? Mike Tyson's old manager. What do you got there? Pulling it up, bobby? Nope. Nope. There's an old Jewish guy. I forget his name, but he was a. He had a tremendous library of films. Yeah, that's one of the things that uh, Mike Tyson used to go and watch, you know, obviously we're talking about the early eighties, so this is before vhs tapes or raw. I mean, those things weren't on vhs tapes, so he would watch them like on 16 millimeter film. Yeah, yeah, yeah. God Damn. I'm struggling to remember his fucking name. It's driving me crazy. Something with a J. Anyway, point being, he probably edited that out, who didn't want to show the controversy because it was plain straight cheating. They just cheated.

Speaker 3:          00:17:06       I want to hear the, what the commentators did during that stall point. Oh, we don't know what's going on. Or did they just veer off into other Ta sometimes how baseball commentators just start talking about some weird random shit about their family is downside, you know, went out fishing in lake is great, man. The mosquitoes get to you, but. Okay. Yeah. Hi. In a way, baseball players. It's an art to that, right? Because there's so much downtime. Yeah, it's A. Oh absolutely. It's so much downtime. I was watching one clip, I forget what Teva was, but it was a, just of the, it was

Speaker 5:          00:17:50       somebody at bat and then one of his teammates was just exactly Mike and his, his, uh, just imitating his batting style and ritual. Just each from like every little nuance to just what he would do with his left foot and just. And He, and then he was doing that for all his teammates because you got so much downside that you, him and you around them a 162 games and plus practice. So you're like, yeah, I know exactly all of your moves or your mannerisms. Exactly. Every one of your mannerisms down to the eye. Twitch, my high school wrestling coach refused to call baseball sport. He's like, it's not a sport skill, skills, game, skills game. But you do have to run, you have to run. This is not my favorite sport, but I respect it a lot. Um, I don't, I, you know, heavy biases from the cups.

Speaker 5:          00:18:46       I don't know anybody was playing baseball once they get arrested, that's a lot of you got to be arrested or you gonna fuck j Lo. That's how a lot of people found out. Hobby Baez is one of the best defenders and elite makes incredible plays. And where you like, that's, that's athletics. If somebody. Oh for sure. But it's, it's a lot of skill involved, but it's definitely it. Definitely athletes. I think. Yeah, they are, but it's like there's a big gap between dad and say like basketball, like you have to be in some extreme cardio, right? Basketball, you're running back and forth and back and forth and you know, those guys are always sore after games and you know, they got fucking plantar fasciitis and shoulder issues. Constant activity is no, you know, you can be in left field a couple of minutes and not do anything.

Speaker 5:          00:19:35       Just chilling out there with your own thoughts. Talking to the fans and shit. Yeah, it's none of that in basketball just standing around except for during free throws or downtime. But baseball players might go, especially if the pitcher is killing it. Yeah. You just, you just get into your fucking stands halfheartedly and. But you know, it might not be coming out there. That's the other thing about baseball fans will torture you if you're sitting out there. Oh yeah, that's a long time to be out there on a away game plus the drinking. There's 18 minutes of action. Your average major league baseball game, that's like less than one fight. Eighteen minutes actually, that's like one championship fight or less than less than one championship fight or basically one slash three round fight, which is 15 minutes of action. That's crazy. We acted like we made a big discovery in shit. Yo. Baseball borrowing. Yeah, we did it. Well. Baseball is one of those games, like if you tried to invent it today, they'd be like, get the fuck away from there with DNA. That shit is definitely old school. But the other thing about that 18 minutes of action, that's not even action of

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       everybody that's in that. Everybody moving at once, like a football game or basketball. That's maybe three or four people moving around. Yeah, depends. Usually if you turned on the double play then you know it was a handful of people involved in. But yeah, it's pretty boring. Shit, I ain't get paid a lot. A lot of games. I guess it's crazy how much money is involved in it. People I get mad, but it's gone to like Japan. Where else? What other countries adopted baseball adopted it took it a super popular in Japan. I know Cuba. Cuba, right. I take it maybe Mexico, Mexico on a career. I'm just saying stuff. Yeah. I don't know. Just guessing. It's amazing how little interest people here have for soccer. That's what's really amazing. When you say a soccer worldwide and see how little we give a fuck about it here, except those annoying white dudes that like to get really hyped up about it. When the World Cup comes around and they scream and yell at bars like they really give a fuck. This reportedly growing belief that Bryce Harper's next contract could be worth over $400,000,000.

Speaker 3:          00:22:06       I couldn't imagine Jesus just a that type of a serious scrutiny and attention on my finances like that. Brian has expectation. This is not even. Not The contract is set yet, but when people are talking about what you might make so much money, it's a lot of money. It's too much money, too much money to be resting over your head, sink full of hundreds to well say. It's about. I don't know. I mean it depends on what state he lives in, how much money it actually is. Well, it becomes a thing like with floyd mayweather, you know, like a big thing about floyd mayweather is how much money he makes is not just that he's a great boxer, it's that he's going to make $300,000,000. Apparently it's going to be even more than that. And you see the paper view numbers, they're talking about six point $5, million pay per view buys, so it's more than 2 million more than the manny Pacquiao fight.

Speaker 3:          00:23:05       That's insane. Does that include the potential refunds today? That's a good question. Well to be fair, he did nickname himself money mayweather. Well he did after he was pretty boy floyd. He changed it, but yeah. Then he built the persona around. I spend money. Yes. He doesn't have to do. I mean it is. It's cool and good for him, but he did make a big thing about spending money that one time he showed up like $100, million dollar check. Stupid. Like, wait, why is that? Unlike a regular ass check on a regular chase bank check. It wasn't even a big cardboard one night even net or print out

Speaker 2:          00:23:45       or print it out on a or even a wire or something. I will get that wired. Yeah. Laminate that thing is real. He's really holding onto a $100,000,000 check. But it was just a regular as check that you would buy groceries on in the eighties. Yeah. Yeah. That $100 million. Yeah. I guess he wrote it to himself. So it's made with it promotions general for. Yeah. Yeah. You got 100 million and a bank of America I guess. So it seems like he just holds onto it too. Hey, he doesn't catch it. That's a weird. Out of his book bag at one of the uh, yeah, but I mean why is he hanging on onto that? Why did you should probably catch that was his other account anyways. It's mainly where the promotions account. Who Cares? So the bay where the personal account, the checking. So he's probably gonna make more than $300. Million Dollars from this last fight. Sure. Yeah. Amazing. I can't imagine that they won't do that again. That him and connor won't do it again with a wet finger. Konica figure out how to not get tired.

Speaker 2:          00:24:51       If he could convince people like say if he fights Paulie Malignaggi he's beats the shit out of Paulie Malignaggi and then says Freud, let's do it one more fucking time. And I think Florida. Nah Man. Come on. We did that. Know, I know he starts thinking about that money could. If you could figure out a way to get people excited about it. Connor could get somehow somehow or another get more people to pay attention because it was an interesting fight for the first three or four rounds. It's made it. He made it look interesting, but it really wasn't interested. I thought it was interesting. But then when I thought back it wasn't interested. Well he caught clean. You know, he caught him with an upper cut in the first round. Nobody hits fully clean like that. Lloyd underestimated in my thoughts. So wasn't. He wasn't doing that shoulder roll?

Speaker 2:          00:25:38       No, he was. Because he wanted to. He didn't believe in Conexpo. So floyd usually boxes anything. That's what it is when you always see them boxing that like he blocked Canelo and he does that and and he goes off of that counter. I don't think that's what it was. I think he knew that conner was going to get tired if he was backing up. He knows that connor has a endurance problems and as long as he wasn't throwing a lot of punches, which floyd wasn't, and he's constantly faking and moving. He's got connor backing up. He could be. It's way easier to be defensive if you're not being authentic. So if you're not thinking about hitting the guy, if you're constantly like fainting and you've got your hands up, you're moving forward, but really what you're thinking about is what he's throwing. You can get away with a lot and you could press for it a lot more because you're going to see the punches coming because you're not really thinking too much about throwing your own punches unless he's like a clear wide opening.

Speaker 2:          00:26:29       So for the first couple of rounds he was mostly like putting pressure on them, sizing him up. When I watched it after the fight, it became way more obvious, like while you're watching it, you're like, what's gonna Happen? What's gonna happen once you already know what's what's happened then. Then I watched it and I said, oh, I could see exactly what he's doing. He's fainting, putting a lot of pressure on conor and he's making kind of backup a lot, which exists is exhausting. And then also connor's not very efficient. He's not a boxer. So like there's a lot of energy being wasted. Like he's going to get tired more easily and then he doesn't run so he doesn't have the same kind of endurance of floyd has. It's a lot. A lot of factors in there.

Speaker 3:          00:27:04       Yeah, it was 111 punches, but some of them were like, yeah, all the ones that connor landed. You mean there was a few of them. They were like little [inaudible] yeah. Yeah. There were also like weird ones like Patty Patty, patty punches to the side of the head in the back of the head. This is one main it kind of this and it just is this box and shit. Well, you know, you get used to that in mma, you know, you get used to hammer fists. Well I think that's what I saw. I was talking about the and a lot of other people were just wondering if muscle memory is going to just kick in and he was going to do some weird information and it did kick it a little bit, but not to the extreme.

Speaker 2:          00:27:46       Yeah, I think there was some massive penalties for any. So if he had any sort of a point deduction or anything that they did something illegal. I think he had a massive penalty more than a million dollars for each thing. He fucked up 10

Speaker 3:          00:28:00       mil. 10 Mil makes them for each one. That makes sense. At that 10 mil makes you get your shit together.

Speaker 2:          00:28:07       As long as he's not, doesn't get disqualified. It might be worth it like 10 million for one fucking needed of the body.

Speaker 3:          00:28:16       You know, I, I didn't know you used to fight until after the last time I did the podcast. I just thought you have got to work out a lot and just really liked mixed martial arts and combat. But I never fought in mixed martial arts because he wasn't around. But a kickboxing. Yeah, I did that. Yeah. Because I remember just seeing something. Somebody said, Oh, you talking about rogen like that. He'll kick you in your shit. And I'm like, what? And then I looked up Rogan. Kickboxing. Huh? What the fuck? This whole time she was kicking the shit out of her back. Yeah. Yeah. How'd that feel, man, to hit somebody feels weird. The bag. Oh, bags. Easy. Yeah. Bags don't hit back. When's the last time you hit somebody

Speaker 2:          00:29:00       in? In anger or in a competition? It's been a long fucking time. It was anger. Neither one. Neither one's in longer. Anger and anger is probably a highschool hold. Competitions when I was 22 or something like that, that was a taekwondo tournament. I was 19 then.

Speaker 3:          00:29:17       Oh, and that was you. The walk off those. Meet with the Walker.

Speaker 2:          00:29:24       Have you kicked so of the body like that? A spinning back kick to the body. So much bulletproof. Doesn't matter that thing. That's just moral protection.

Speaker 3:          00:29:31       Oh Man. So what was your at that moment when you saw him laying down and he's dead? I knew he was gone, but I'm not dead. And you know, taken Tam. He's not getting up.

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       Was it like. Yeah, you have to walk away and make it look like it's no big deal. That was how my thought process was. Don't get excited. Make lives like this is what I'm going to do to everybody. Just relax. Just walk off and have everybody so nervous. So you don't even care. Like this is just a normal thing for you. You kick people to go unconscious, they fall down, they can't get up that you gotta have that people because you're in a tournament. So you're going to be fighting a bunch of people and then watch it. Yeah. You might have to fight three or four times in a day. Who was there rooting for you to see my teammates because of the train with no, it doesn't even seem like even more I watch. That doesn't really feel like me so long ago. Just a hair.

Speaker 2:          00:30:21       Well, not only that, I mean I also have a head protector on the back of my hand. They would wear these a head protectors. Either you could wear a full one that covers your whole head, like over your ears or you were one that's just the back of your head, which is really just there. So when you get knocked out, your head doesn't need fucking bounce off the ground. Yeah, because we were fighting on a basketball court. You look at that, that's just a wood floor shit. Yeah, there's a lot of that fun on the hockey rink once where they put a plastic sheet down on a hockey rink. So it was a, not the ice but the cement underneath the hockey rink. So we were basically fighting on cement. So the eighties with terrible is fucking awful bad for brain damage, that's for sure. A lot of people who got fucked up, knocked out and bounce their head off the ground.

Speaker 2:          00:31:05       Jesus, I saw a lot of that. Oh not good. And for no money, that's the thing. There's no future, no future and no money for the love of the game. Well, I guess it prepares you for life and also you wanted to find out. I wanted to find out how I would. Do you know, I wanted to find out what it would be like to compete under high stress situations. Like worrying about someone kicking you in the face. Yeah. I'm glad that most people can't kick somebody in the face, so I'm glad that's whatever I go to UFC fight or even made the ad just whenever somebody gets kicked in the face and if I got kicked in the face. Have you sold disappointed? It's not good. It's not. It looks. It looks crazy. Yeah. It's terrible for you. The thing is more people can kick people in the face now than I think at any other time in human history.

Speaker 2:          00:31:57       I think there's a lot of fucking people that can kick people in the face now because of watching MMA and internet and classes training. I think more people training now than. Than ever before for sure. There's way more people that could strangle people than ever. Oh yeah. One hundred percent because the choke is easier to learn now. It's just more people doing Jujitsu than any other time in history. Like before, like in my early martial arts days, there was no one that was doing grappling really. Like I wrestled in high school and then there was no like Jujitsu classes. There was like you could take judo, like there was judo, but there was very few like actual submission grappling schools or anything like that. Even nationwide there was a small

Speaker 4:          00:32:40       handful. Nobody knew what the fuck they were doing. Now everywhere you look, there's a Jujitsu school. Like I was down in San Diego, just San Diego alone, which is not a big city. They must have 100 Jujitsu schools

Speaker 3:          00:32:51       just in San Diego. Shit. Crazy. I'm going to start sponsoring more fighters. Yeah. Are you remember? I sponsored a and she. Ms Dot wait. Yeah. And INVICTA, right? Yeah. She's going to do more. I am. Some other people reached out. I got to just get some new designs for the club. That's what's been holding me back. I gotta get some new designs that will. That was an okay design, but I had a mix up like your face on her ass or something like that. Is that the whole body? It wasn't just last day. It was, it was just in case, you know, just in case she got knocked out and fell on her face. Did Hannibal buress I come, yeah. Yeah. You could do it in some organizations still. There it is. Oh yeah. All over it. She didn't make weight. That didn't make weight. I think it's harder for girls to make weight.

Speaker 3:          00:33:40       Well she. Well she's. She's fighting next week at. I think she was trying to fight at 1:15 and she's fighting at 1:25 now or she was trying to fight. I think she's trying to fight at one. Oh, five and now fight. They want either. Was she cutting much weight? She's cutting this weight this time. That was the other thought about the conor fight. A lot of people thought that connor cut too much weight. That's one of the reasons why I burned out. Yeah, it's part of it. I think it was a factor. He does cut a lot of weight and that does drain your body and it's not like when he's training, he's cutting that Wayne because he's not, you know, like you only do it once, you do it right before the weigh ins

Speaker 4:          00:34:18       you weigh in and then you put the weight back on. So all that endurance training, all this hard rounds that you did, that's not after you're dehydrated

Speaker 3:          00:34:26       yourself severely. So your body's not used to operating exactly that level with this situation. Yeah, well he's used to it

Speaker 4:          00:34:35       because he fights in mma like that, but mma, you get more chances to take a break. You get. It's, it's different. You know, it's more exhausting, like it could potentially be more exhausting because there's grappling and there's kicks and there's just a lot more going on and you're fighting five minute rounds, like you have more of a chance to get tired in that five minute rounds, but when you clench with someone, you could actually hold onto them, like referee's not going to break it. You can take them to the ground and get on top of them. You couldn't hold your position and catch your breath. There's there's more opportunities to recover.

Speaker 3:          00:35:06       Right? At weight cutting is the worst part of fighting. One hundred percent seems. It was even the fighter that a judge was opposed to fight that day. She took a picture of herself and she made weight, but it looks terrible. It was definitely one. Oh, five. Not at our member [inaudible]. One 15 wouldn't look crazy, like, well it could if you were fine. It was just like, she's like, I waiting. I was like, Oh, you okay? It was just a. She put it phone on. I. I'm like, you know what, that she tried. She tried to make wait shit. Who Cares? A few pounds, but I guess those few pounds matter. Obviously somebody is overweight and didn't go through the strenuous process that you went to today.

Speaker 4:          00:35:58       Minute advantage. Yeah. You have an advantage if you're not dehydrating yourself as much, but that advantage is crazy. Like they should stop doing that. They really should figure out a way to stop fighters from cutting weight like that. What's the alternative? The alternative is to weigh them like randomly the same way they catch people that drugs like when like random drug tests do random weight tests, like they show up and they go, oh Hannah, but look, you're 175 pounds. You're supposed to be fighting at 1:55. What the fuck is that? Like, okay. And then they catch you again. Okay, well you're 176 pounds today. All you're definitely not fighting at 1:55. And they'll, they'll give you a way parameter. Like it says it's healthy for you to cut 10 pounds. You've got to fight at one 66. That's your weight class. So it'll force fighters to be more disciplined about their actual weight.

Speaker 4:          00:36:42       Like you can't balloon up in between rounds or in between competition. And you're also, you know, you have to think about how much weight you could actually dehydrate out of your body. Healthy California has some new Ra laws, like they only let you cut a certain amount of weight. Like they'll, uh, they, they periodically measure people like during their camp and give them an opportunity and they measure them during the camp. And those was one of the reasons I hadn't Barao who was the bantamweight champion. He fought aljamain sterling, but they wouldn't let him fight at 1:35. They made them fight at 1:40 [inaudible] like he cut too much weight

Speaker 3:          00:37:16       catch weight. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, I think that should be the option for the crazy fired is just to whatever weight you want to be class, that'd be one like foot fires that might not be active on that on the bill. And we got the spot like guest but the guest, but guest by on the comedy. So you know, somebody just pops up, hey pop up fight. No matter what the way it is, these two fighters, they whatever the fuck wait, they want to be, they've agreed to fight. We got this guy coming in and one 65, this other guy coming in at 2:15. They agreed to fight each other. You're cool with that. Like old school? UFC One? Yeah, like the old school, but not crazy, you know that sumo wrestler versus you know, 100 pound dude. But

Speaker 4:          00:38:01       how much weight? Thirty pounds difference like that cat was the cap.

Speaker 3:          00:38:05       I think it's up to late. Leave it up to the person. A guest is the guest spot. Well, lot of

Speaker 4:          00:38:13       people do that in a grappling tournaments and grappling tournaments. They have the absolute division and the absolute division. Sometimes the lighter guys when the whole thing. Yeah, but there's no hitting. That's the thing about grappling, you know, it's like you can, you can get by and skill and technique and an understanding your positioning where like know you're fighting a guy like, like Francis

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       in Ghana or something like that. It's just a giant 265 pound dude. If you're 150 pound guy, you're fucked. You're just fucked. That guy. He's what? Eight something or he's 10 and 1:10 and one. Yeah, I think he lost one of his early fights. The commission. Okay. Look that they have a 10 point plan to curb the weight. Cutting a while. Protecting fighters now normalized in the commission's rules are steeper, fine for missing. Wait a 10 percent cap on the way to fighter is allowed to gain between the time the weigh ins. Oh, that's interesting. And an event, uh, and the weight class restrictions for those who miss weight more than once, they also recognized for new weight classes. I think that's huge. Have a bunch of weight class. They should have weight classes every 10 pounds. That Guy Andy Foster, he's the California State Athletic Commission Executive Director. He's the shit.

Speaker 2:          00:39:24       That guy's awesome. He really is the most proactive at of all of the athletic commission guys. So that's it. They'll figure it out. They banned the use of [inaudible], which is interesting too because ivs help you considerably to rehydrate. Sure. Yeah. They banned him. Yeah, they banned them. They don't want people relying on that because thirsty punched fight. Just all these articles about a Kevin Doran about talking shit about under armour. Dude, that crushed their stock yesterday. It's easy. It's the trump of basketball shoe stocks. No. You know what he did? He's just like casually commenting about like how kids will pick schools based on what, what, um, what, what, uh, sneakers. They're going to have to wear it. True. Yeah. Oh, started to rent. Takes a shot at under armor. But he just said it and like in a matter of fact, sort of a way, it's like kids don't want to play an under underarmour.

Speaker 2:          00:40:21       So you look at this. Nobody wants to play in under armour. I'm sorry. The top kids don't because they all play Nike on a podcast. Podcast interview dropped the stock. Is that what it was? A podcast, a ringer podcast. It dropped the stock three percent. Much money. That must be for a giant company like under armour. Three percent. That's a billion dollar plus company. Three percent is probably tens of millions of dollars. Right? Get a bounce back though. How much is the, the actual difference? Uh Oh, it's slow. It's down 44 percent assessed to start a year. Oh, that's not good if it's already been slight. Yeah. There's a lot of issues with under armour and hunting too. A lot of people think that under armour is a, they're, they're worried about their hunting division because like anti hunters, they, they're like the only gigantic company that has the stones to support something that's controversial as hunting. I haven't been around very long though either. Right? Under armour 15 years. Maybe. That's a good question. Like I read that then I think they're from the nineties. I read some. Adidas started back long, long

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       time ago and then two brothers and that's where Puma started as the two brothers started due to some boom or something like that. Or

Speaker 4:          00:41:39       didas is from run DMC. My Adidas, that's like 1980 something. They're just now rebounding from the problems. That nice juicy that quick. You're a wizard. You listen, man, she's got a hatch up. Pour it out. I be professional. That's The craziest, fastest pee of you've down three waters since you've been here, man. You lift all this. Talk about these fighters, dehydrating yourself. You know,

Speaker 3:          00:42:03       fuck that. I don't have to live by those rules. Nope, not in. Not In this game

Speaker 4:          00:42:08       we were talking about under armour. They, they, uh, have a hunting division. And they take a ton of shit because I know there's a, there's a bunch of like crowdfunding thing, not crowd funds. What are those things? So it wasn't a fun thing. It was a crowd something or another that we're going after. Cameron Hanes, because they were calling him a trophy hunter and they were trying to get under armour to drop him. But then you look at like how many people like their, their hunting divisions is tiny division and then under armour itself, the company is just gigantic. It's very interesting. There's not a lot of companies that would be that big that would support hunting. Takes a lot of balls.

Speaker 3:          00:42:48       Yeah. That means the CEO is definitely into hunting and he's like, this is my buddies. Yeah, well yeah, the owners. And it's like you imagine Nike got into hunting. No Way. He was in golf with Tiger Woods and obviously he was a gigantic athlete for them, but now that he's not out there even playing golf, the golf division, I think they just closed it this year. Like they don't even make anything anymore. They'll make some clothes for and some shoes, like they're putting golf spikes on the bottom of Jordan's, but like they don't make clubs or anything anymore I think because what the Huh. They just put in golf spikes on the bottom of just get some of those extra charges out there from the recalls section and just talk some spikes on there and just get them out to the US Open.

Speaker 4:          00:43:33       Well we were talking last night about rappers that get sponsored by shoe companies at the store. Like I didn't know that rappers had contracts with shoe companies. Nike announces it will no longer make golf clubs balls and bags.

Speaker 3:          00:43:45       You said this and I run DMC. They probably for sure how to contrast. Yeah. 50 slash fifty cent and Jay Z had a commercial wrapping back and forth at each other. Who else? Kanye has his own shoe. He has his own. He. Yeah, but he had it with Nike originally and then went to adidas. Uh, that's the only rappers or could you imagine if a comic. Kevin Hart, Kevin Hart, Kevin will. You have to go to the next absolute level. Stratosphere as a comic or I mean, unless you really want to do it and do it on a, on a small artisanal level, then you could. You could do whatever you want to do. Yeah. I guess that's a. it's a weird thing though, that rappers get sponsored by companies

Speaker 5:          00:44:32       like. Well, like Kendrick Lamar, he's got a. Some sort of a shoe company thing. Popular Person. Huge. Yeah, right, but does that guy work out? I think Ken's would probably works out probably because you know what? It's certain rappers I could tell that they work out based on this show. Really? Oh, because they have energy. Well not even just energy, but if you look, especially if your songs and your lyrics are very dense, where your betterment and you wrap it up, that takes a lot of breath control and cardio. Especially if you're not doing it. If you don't have a hype man on stage. If you a hype man, the hype man is someone just isn't it? Just the energy is so you can catch a breath and so he'll take those last couple of words on a line and then you catch your breath and then you come back because a lot of people don't have the breath control.

Speaker 5:          00:45:23       So a lot of times even if somebody is not ripped, they're in shape, they're lungs are in shape. If they can do a whole a whole show of just, you know, kind of rapid fire songs and shit. I never thought about that. A hype man, Huh? Yeah. That's what the hype man. I mean as far as it's definitely they bring the energy up, but a lot of times if you see a rapper and at their show and they don't have a hype man, they're like, you know, I could spit my own shit all the way. I don't need a hype man. Yeah, yeah. Especially if they're fast with their lyrics. Right? Yeah. And Kendrick does it, you know, he doesn't wrap over his own beats. That's a pet peeve of mine, a lot of big rappers and they will just wrap over the song, the actual song.

Speaker 5:          00:46:07       Oh, own lip sync. And almost pretty much just wrap it over the shit at their own concert. Now get sometimes if a, say you pop up as somebody show to do a guest spot as a rapper and you do your biggest song. This person's Dj doesn't have your instrumental. He only has the regular track, the rap over that. But it's just show. I don't want to hear you rap over that because he was just rapping over as well produced song. I'd rather just hear this shit. Chris being a club, right? Yeah. Yeah. Just otherwise you're just seeing their presence. That's just it. I mean it's still, you know, it's still fun, but it's just not when you, when you know what the alternative is, which is you being a good polished performance, then you're like, come on man. Just don't wrap up your shit. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:46:54       That's a weird pop thing. Right? Pop singers are kind of allowed to do that. We know they do it, but when they get busted, it's a huge deal. Like what was the girl Ashley? What the fuck? Nationally, Samsung. That was a big disaster, right? She kind of vanished after that for that too bad timing. Yeah. She had a show. They're trying to ramp her up on on TV. Like the diary of it. Oh yeah. They pulled up. Pulled the plug on that fucker. That's it for her. Yeah. I ever heard about her again. Not really. Not really round. Sorry. The party. That was like 15 years ago, right? At least

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       15. I think it might've been like easy to easy to where I worked in 2009, so the couple years before the Atacama guest. Oh six for my mom looking at what is it? Oh Wow. Yeah. Damn. Thirteen fucking years time and we'll fly. He does not wait for you. You got to be. Yeah. If you're going to be a person who sings on stage and moves around on stage and you're not going to be going over your track, you have to be in some serious shape yet. It's a to put on a solid show. Thomas is no music and you just fucking rebroke breaking our music now, but nobody know where to find out. Yeah, but this is December 14th. Two thousand 16 this shit out yet. She said 45. Now look at her. She's got kids and had a whole yoga. She found she found value in other things besides show business. He got to go for probably a good move for some people, you know, just get out now. We were looking at um, what the fuck's his name? Mick Jagger's routine. Like Mick Jagger's, 185 years old. And that dude works out twice a day. Yeah. Like he does yoga, he lifts weights. He has trainers. I kid, he's just doing everything to try to keep his body together. Like Bang. And then might want to keep fucking supermodels.

Speaker 2:          00:48:59       Is this girl like 27? Yeah, he's got like a 18 year old girl. I trained five, six days a week, but I don't go crazy. I alternate between gym work and dancing. Then I do sprints, things like that. I'm training for stamina. He shredded though. They had a picture of like Mick Jagger, like his body eight miles a day. Damn. He runs eight miles a day. Swimming, kickboxing and cycling. How old is he? He's got to be like 72. Right. Let's. Let's take a guess. How old do you think Mick Jagger is? He's. Yeah, he's 77 I think. Seventy two. Good. Yeah. Seventy two. Seventy three. I remember seeing something when we were kids. Seventy two year olds were dead. Absolutely. There was nothing left and like you, you had, you were on empty. Your body was 74. He's almost 80. Was almost 100. Then how long is he gonna live a hambrick. How does melon otherwise girlfriend look at her hot as fuck.

Speaker 2:          00:50:02       She's Mickey Dirty Dick. She's just turned 30 and he knocked her up, right? Didn't he shoot a live one in there? Yeah. What are the odds that kid's going to come out and not have super powers? All this stuff that he's taken this to stay young. Wow, that's crazy. Thirty years old. Here's what I want. Mick Jagger, because of the baby. Giant head look. The kid can read minds. The kids heads filled with vitamins and anti aging serum. Look at her. She's like, Yo, Daddy's 70 foot. Yeah, Daddy's older. Didn't the president. We have to find you a positive role model because your daddy probably won't be around very much longer. Have you heard of Maroon five at all when you're 74 and you're having a kid that is super ambitious, like you're optimistic as fuck to be 74 and have a kid? Yeah. I'm, I'm 34 and I'm like, oh, I need to get.

Speaker 2:          00:51:03       If I'm going to have kids I need to get it in next. Something happened in the next couple of years. Yeah, that's a good move. But I would never. Seventy four of brand new one. Yeah. That's super bold. I guess it's just, you know, you know, he's got a great story by that. You know Theo Vaughn, do you know thea? Hilarious dude. He's fucking hilarious. Uh, his dad was like in his seventies when he had him and he's got hilarious stories about going to school and like telling people that's his grandpa and being embarrassed. It's his dad. His Dad was fair falling asleep everywhere. It sounds like fair behavior for a kid who's j dot jaggers. This girl is first kids 45. Jesus Christ. Man. This first kid could be, his girlfriend's mom might have an older one too. Oh Man. Is He married to the girl? The new girl?

Speaker 2:          00:51:52       It says spouse. So he's probably like, why not? I'll get married. We don't give a fuck. Take my partner partner even better. That's how it needs to give him my money to my kids. Partner means fool me twice. Shame on me three times. I'm senile. Oh, move in and collect on my estate. His lover. Lover. Isn't that funny that we have like distinctions like did you or did you not scribble on the paper? It's just did you or did you not agree to some stupid shit that doesn't make any sense financially. Juha digital. Is your estate at stake with this relationship or not? Can you just shoot it

Speaker 4:          00:52:34       loads in her random or willy nilly or does she have access to half of your money? Let me know what. Nope, she doesn't let me know what's going on. What's the deal? What kind of deal would you guys make that's, uh, that, that deal? It's just so weird. I have a friend that is a super rich dude and he was getting married, his wife did not want a prenuptial and he was like, well this is crazy. Like why wouldn't I get a prenuptial? Like if we stay together, like we don't have to worry about anything because you know, you'll, you'll be fine, you'll have plenty of money. But if we break up, why would I be in a situation where you could get half my money? She goes, you don't think this relationship is going to last. That's why it was. No, I think it's going to last. That's why I want a prenuptial [inaudible] it's not going matter. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:53:14       And if, if, if it doesn't last, let's work out a side deal that isn't, that have. Yeah. You can't just hold that over me. Like, well his ex wife held it over like

Speaker 4:          00:53:26       they, he didn't have a prenup and when they got divorced it was a disaster. And so then he was going into a second marriage and this lady was like, I don't want a prenup. And he was like, what? I've already done this like the fuck out of here. So tough Combo works out. It works out.

Speaker 3:          00:53:44       Yeah, that's a heavy. I've had some heavy combos in my life, but that's one of the ones where were kicking it for a couple years. But uh, yeah, I don't want you to just in case this goes poorly, let's just get this out of the way real quick. Careful. Like what stage of the relationship

Speaker 4:          00:54:00       chip you do this too because in the beginning, like if you decide to get married after like six months, you're like, you're on drugs, right? You're blessed, you're blessed out. He can't believe the relationships working so well. It's amazing. She's incredible. She's my life. She's my partner, she's my soul. She's my partner. She's everything to me. Then you just get sick of each other. About two, three years in and then with the seven year itch, you know, that seven year itch starts talking to a lawyer and she goes, okay, listen, let's just. If we, if I get divorced now and then the lawyer goes, well, how much money is he making now? Does he have any other financial opportunities that are on the table that could perhaps increases walt over the next few years because you might want to hang in there for a few start thinking about it. Mercenary, like, like if I just get to 11 years, if I get to 11 years, then he gets the CEO position and starts making x amount of money. Terrible.

Speaker 3:          00:54:55       I did have living in a house with a woman and then she starts hating you or resenting you at some point and then starts plotting, leaving. We're all just still says living in the house, hey honey, blah blah blah, and then just just going through the motions of what a marriage is supposed to be. Secretly gonna end it and she kinda knows exactly what she's going to end it. That sounds terrifying. It's terrifying, but it's also adorable. It makes me laugh. Makes me laugh because it's so silly

Speaker 4:          00:55:29       because it's such a human thing like it's not. It's. It's such a cultural and a human thing and it's this weird lottery like this. The reason why men are attractive to women at all, when they're really wealthy, if they're gross, gross dude, like, who's that guy? Rupert Murdoch, the guy who owns Fox. Yeah. He's like, he's old as fuck. He doesn't take care of his body's kind of like. But he's got this hot wife, right? There's something. There's something adorable about that because this, this is this weird human folly

Speaker 3:          00:56:01       thing we got going on. Security and all that shit. It's a little bit of that lower empower, blah blah blah. But it's also us scam.

Speaker 4:          00:56:10       And what's interesting is a guy like that becomes attractive because he's wealthy and the woman's not wealthy, right? You got assume if she's worth a billion dollars, he wouldn't be attracted. She just start fucking her personal trainer and I'm buying a Ferrari, honey, eat mommy's Pissy, you know, like that kind of shit. But if you get to a situation where you find this old dude and you know, well, he's just really kind to me and other young guys, they just wanted to have sex and leave me and he just takes care of me. And then what does that does that Rupert Murdoch, secretary of the Treasury, Munch and. Oh yeah, he's got a banging hot wife. Yeah, that's the lady that got in trouble because she was tweeting about all the different clothes and things she had on a, on a government trip. She's on a government jet and she's like tagging all the bag. She wears the shoes. She wears it and she's smoking and he

Speaker 5:          00:57:00       like. He looks like her dad easily. Right. Doesn't mean for sure he's gross switch. When you think about how many people have lost every jobs and money because of twitter is really fascinating. I've had a situation happened because of it, but nothing. I haven't done any. I haven't had a stupid as social media blow up when you're thinking about how insane it is with that, with this is a media where you can literally control every single word you say and you still say some wild shit that costs you millions of dollars, will cost you relationships

Speaker 4:          00:57:44       around your friends you don't think twice about. And he said it online. What I was going to say about these rich women though, is that like when you're a wealthy man and the woman's not wealthy, the fact that you're wealthy is attractive, but then if she marries you, oh,

Speaker 5:          00:57:59       she's rich to now, now you're just a dude and now you're gross, and now she wants to stay rich. So she has just kind of hang in there and are you talking to me out of getting married, trying to. I always tell people it's one day won't be around one day. Marriage won't be a thing. It's going to take time. You know, I spend my money on, I do random, which I was, uh, I was caught in a weird Internet wormhole last week. I was a little high and on some adderall and I clicked on it. And on adderall or high on adderall, high on weed and all that. Jesus, what's that like? It's great because it's a, you have to focus that energy of adderall, but the creativity of week, Ooh, that's a good Combo, right? Like that. Is that how you write? I was planning to write, but I just took some different times on the internet than I would normally take. I should have written, but it's just when you, when you take adderall, which is supposed to do is when you take it, you're supposed to get settled with what you want to work on right away and then when it kicks in, you focus in on it versus you know, I think when my shit kicked in, I was just on the Internet so I just really dug deep into the Internet. And so, uh, there was this article, this guy

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       on this, this comedian that has all these funny tweets. And so I started looking at his tweets. Yeah. Good tweets. And then when his tweet said, uh, I'm a, uh, helped my friend go to wrestling school and it was just this young woman that wants to go to restless. She wants to go to pro wrestling the scope. And I went to wwe smackdown a couple of days prior. So wrestling was Kinda on my brain. So she got a go fund me and I just paid for her wrestling school.

Speaker 5:          00:59:50       Never met him. I ain't got no cars, Joe Hall and we'd just adderall weed and income and just pay for some random restless school though. You just uber everywhere?

Speaker 3:          01:00:05       Uh, yeah. Well I rent cars some places, but yeah, when I'm in La, a uber or lyft around where you live in Chicago, I'll get a, I'll get a rental, but I'm not there that much. Even though I, my residence in Chicago now, I'm still not going to read a lot. And so for my own frugality I can't justify having a car yet. I am wondering that's an interest in going to get one. So I'm a breakout of it. My Dad is super cheap and so that's just kinda his brother still. I'm lightly extravagant and cheap and practical at the same second extravagant watch. What is that? This is a, I don't know the name for Berrera. It's beautiful. I bought it because I was hyped before I was a shopping before I did some shows at radio city with Chappelle and so I was right before sound check. I was, I need to buy a shirt. I bought a nice shirt and then I'm like, fuck it. I'm gonna. Get a nice watch. And it wasn't. It's that, that crazy. It was like 700 bucks or some shit. Yes. Mr. Bull. Yeah, it's a reasonable. It's too much for a watch, but not yet

Speaker 5:          01:01:10       stupid without. See. That's the one thing that fucks me up about watches. Like if you told me that watch was 10 grand, I'd be like, okay. Like it's the same thing. Yeah, it looks like it could be a 10 grand watch. Right. Watches are weird. Like that was a weird, but it just kinda pop on stage a little bit and it's, you know, it's a bracelet with the time. Yeah. Did you see that floyd mayweather watched? We were talking about the La Ferrari. That's all crystal. 600. Looks like some futuristic shit. It looks 600 grand on a lot. 600. See I could never, never. Yeah. Still even still now when I have this, I'd be like 700 bucks on this. Jesus Christ. Guess what? You had a book that Gig and Boise to cover this shit can be doing this gun ended up on 30 for 30. Broke that what? What kind of car are you going to get? I think I like the Tesla. Oh, okay. Yeah. To go electric. Yeah. Like just if you have to get out of town quick and there's, you have to hope that there's electricity out of town quick. Yeah. Like what if some shit goes down like within some sort of an earthquake or something? Uh, I'll guess I'll just get somebody else's car. I mean I've got friends and shit and I'm sure that'd be leaving. So

Speaker 4:          01:02:20       hop a ride. Yeah. The thing about Tesla's, it gets me, I love them. I think they're great, but you really can only drive them 250 miles. Yeah. I don't give a fuck what they say. And even that, you better be driving slow because if you're driving fast or if you drive it in traffic. Like my business manager came out to Anaheim for the UFC and he drove from a Hollywood to Anaheim and his shit was dead by the time we got to Anaheim. Oh, because there's traffic. Yeah. So he, uh, he was stuck in traffic and it was no like shit on the, off the road he had to find a super station. So you got to go sit there for a half an hour at the super station and when you do that it's fills up to like 75 percent or something like that. Oh yeah. That part's a little bit while

Speaker 3:          01:03:03       drive it. No, maybe I'll get a used car that's practical for the apocalypse.

Speaker 4:          01:03:10       Why don't you get like a hybrid, a lexus hybrid. Hybrid. Yeah. Those are the shit. And then you can operate. I think they have a switch where you could operate. I know they have that for the Acura Nsx, that new NSX. They have an all electric mode where you could drive a totally electric call. You hit all the switches and it's warmer. Yeah. Then it's super fast. Looks fresh. You know what A. Yeah. There you go. Lexus, Lexus. Hybrid, that's a bad ass car to that coop because it's um, it's sporty, but it's just understated enough where you're not driving a Ferrari or a porsche or something like that. But it's bad ass car. That one right there. That. What does that, the ls. Lch. Yeah. It's a bad ass car. Yeah, baby. That's what you need to get yourself one of those. Look at that thing.

Speaker 4:          01:04:02       That's slick. That's pretty slick. Good looking car. And you know what I like about lexuses, man, they just never break. I'm, this is my second lexis that I have right now and I've never had a single fucking problem with them. Those things just never break. You just drive them. They never go wrong. Customer service is fantastic. They have the best customer service in any car I've ever had and they're like deer flashy, but they're not impressing a rapper, you know what I mean? You don't know what type of rapper though. Yeah, that's true, right? It was like A. Yeah, like de la soul. They'd probably be impressed young jeezy by looking at the books.

Speaker 3:          01:04:43       You know, I did this week, I, uh, I donated some money to Red Cross for the Houston thing. People get mad at you for that and then I remembered right away about the Red Cross shit. It was like a knee jerk donation and donate to the Houston food bank also. But then I remembered about the shit with how they handled the Haiti funds and Katrina and then I emailed because it was through Amazon payments. I was like, Hey, uh, can I get that money back please? I want to just give it to some other source. Oh, did you really asked? I haven't got a response, but it was just a, it was one of the weirdest. Now a top 10 weird emails I've sent. Well, I asked for a donation back. Yeah, that's slippery. Right. I wanted back though, because I don't because they, uh, I think it'd be better for some, uh, some, uh, organizations on the ground is one Texas the Texas diaper because everybody need diapers and they're based in San Antonio.

Speaker 3:          01:05:49       So you can just sit and I just went on Amazon and just sent a grand worth of diapers just because that made me feel good because it's super specific and you can't really get to fraudulent with diapers. That's what I mean. That's a good way of looking at it. Like with product you just send the product. I mean maybe somebody worst case scenario somebody steals it, but for the most part if you send in a healthful product, that money, that shit is getting broken up. Some of that should go on to the morgue and some of that shit go to like ink.

Speaker 4:          01:06:19       Yeah. It's weird because I guess affective charities have operating costs. There's no way to. People got to get back to. People have to get paid, you have to pay for logistics and planning and and the Red Cross obviously does a lot of good. There's no, no doubt. They do a lot of good and people just get mad at the accounting thing. Like how much of the money goes, like know on it. We donated money to the Red Cross for Harvey, for Hurricane Harvey and people were like, Yo, the fucking Red Cross a terrible place to donate money and you want to say that, right? People want to say that? Yeah. What is the best thing to donate my. I'd like to know what the best thing to donate for. Like Harvey,

Speaker 3:          01:06:59       I guess. Um, I didn't. Houston food bank at Texas diaper thing. Houston food bank sounds like a good a j. j. j watt has one. The guy he plays for the Houston, Texas is a few other ones that are on the ground and in Houston or in the area where red crosses, you know, I mean there obviously I know they have people on the ground, but it's pretty general.

Speaker 4:          01:07:29       So yeah, they, they handle a lot of different things, but they do a lot of good to like, there's no denying that the Red Cross does a lot of good, but it's, it's that whole accounting thing when people get mad. It's funny man, because there's a lot of people just waiting to get mad at something. Even get mad at where you're donating your money.

Speaker 3:          01:07:46       Well I think it's just. I think the issue is that from the little research I did on it, that Red Cross hasn't had full transparency with how I think people want to know if you give a dollar to Red Cross, what percentage goes to this weapon centers goes to this episode, this goes to this and I don't think they offer that and that makes people feel like they're getting shysters.

Speaker 4:          01:08:14       Do you think that's because they've been around so long to like Red Cross has been around for like how many years ago? One hundred years. Probably something. Right. And it wasn't until the Internet came along that these questions even came up, but that people demanded transparency probably want to.

Speaker 3:          01:08:27       I think it's just because they haven't been that many results from the Haiti earthquake where people don't see tangible results. And I know I donated a bunch on the phone texting to, to uh, you know, I don't know why clef was doing Red Cross thing if he was doing something separate, but I texted a lot just donate when that happened. And so I think it's just when people don't see results for the money, it's just like, you know, they want to, especially if you just try to help something in that, I think that's what makes it worse for people where if you try to help and you donated money to help and you don't really see the results of it, then you're like, what the fuck?

Speaker 4:          01:09:09       Yeah, the Haiti things, it's almost like the infrastructure was so fucked up and there was so much damage done down there that you would need untold billions of dollars to fix everything. It's like when you donate millions, it's like barely even going to see any results. Like I wonder how much, how much damage was actually done to hate. You've got to wonder about Houston. I mean you're talking about Houston being just catastrophic to the point where some places are never going to recover

Speaker 3:          01:09:36       is uh, is pretty messed up. Man. It's raining right now. Still raining. And they were saying how about how the constant development that they've been doing there was part of the reason why the flood, it hit harder because they developed on prairie grass, so certain land where this land might have soaked up some of that. I mean we probably would have still flooded but it might have been less severe if there wasn't needs because the next is a new development.

Speaker 4:          01:10:13       Yeah, I saw that where they're saying that by paving over these areas, those, those areas can no longer absorb the water. But it seems like you're talking about the. Did you ever see the graphic that shows the difference between the amount of water that rained down on Hurricane Katrina versus the amount of water that rained down so far on harvey? Not even including today. And it's going to rain apparently tomorrow too. I think shit, it's, it's so much more water than. Could you look at the difference for 10 to 15 trillion gallons as of August 28th. And what is today? The 29th, the 30th. Today's the 30th. So that's two days ago of rain. And then Katrina is only six point 5 trillion gallons. I mean, that's amazing.

Speaker 3:          01:10:54       I mean that's A. I mean I'm sure there's people that dedicate their lives to this, but how do you count that they're out there with scoops? Measuring is in cubic. Come on man. Come on man. Beyond, beyond like oil drums. You really? Yeah. Come on. How many really know? It definitely looks like a lot and I hope it seems like a of water is all right.

Speaker 4:          01:11:20       Yeah. Well you know, one of the things that I love about tragedies is when people come together and help each other out and one of the things is liver is a line of fishing boats of dudes pulling fishing boats to go and rescue people. It was like a whole line on the highway of dudes with trucks pulling fishing boats and they were dropping them off and they were driving their boat rather ride in their boat down these flooded roads and rescuing people and bringing them to safety. That kind of shit makes me so happy. That's one of the fucked up things about people's. Like sometimes a bad thing makes people see the good in people. It makes people do good things,

Speaker 3:          01:11:57       definitely. But how, how insane. Just the juxtaposition. Does that have to be to like you and your crib as watching a show on Sunday, relaxing, you know, frat and then a few days later you have to be saved by boat from this, from this, from this place where you usually just walk out and get the mail. You have to. Somebody has to pull up with a boat. That's insane. They said it's okay

Speaker 4:          01:12:30       once every 500 year storm too. But how the fuck do they known that 500 years ago people wrote shit down. Park, you know, they, they, they showed like raindrops and skulls.

Speaker 3:          01:12:43       What is that? People House saved her with a jet ski. Wow. Um, that's is

Speaker 4:          01:12:50       my friend's grandmother being jet skied out of her living room in Houston. What about y'all though? What A. Wow. That house is fucked. There's a lot of fucked houses. You other thing about Houston too, is Houston so damp like Houston in the summertime, it's so moist. That means they're going to have crazy mold growth there. Mold is going to be off the charts and that shit makes people sick as fuck. Like A. I've had a friend in Austin, his whole, his house had to be gutted because he was getting sick and they couldn't figure out what was wrong and they came in and did some sort of a test of the air and they're like, dude, you're house is infested. And so they broke down his walls and apparently there was some pipe leakage or something inside the wall and then just the general moisture of the air. The entire walls were filled with this black mold and it was getting everybody sick.

Speaker 3:          01:13:38       Shit, that shit is girls.

Speaker 4:          01:13:40       Yeah, mold is no, no joke, man. That black mold stuff can really fuck you up if you're feeling shitty and your house has mold in it. You got to do something about that because there's something going on there that's a, you're. You're literally being poisoned by house. Damn. But Tom Lucas, dude had that going on too in La. He had to get his house gutted. He, uh, he was feeling sick for like a year and then finally did something about it, found out his house is filled with mold. They tear it down to the, to the raw frame of the house and have to spray everything with this antifungal

Speaker 5:          01:14:12       shit and Redo the whole house again. Shit. How long was he out of the house? Like over a year. I want to just says I'm reading a little article on it says it's a black mold. Yeah. Yeah. It just said it really had his voice hard, fucked up his health. It's no joke, man. I mean, you're, you're breathing in these little organisms mean spores are these little. When you're thinking about mold, that's a, like a fungus, right? Those wouldn't you consider mold fungus? Is that what it is? Yeah, that shit is in the air and it's poisoned. So you're, you're basically breathing in toxic poisoned all the time. Yeah. That shit is just. I couldn't imagine this shit man too. You live in Chicago, you don't, you don't care about winners. It doesn't bother you. I, uh, anywhere I work around it, work around it. So a time you like, yeah, animals not in town. Where the. Well doing gigs in Florida. So about. Yeah, I do, I book, I book myself like that during the winter and in Cali and Arizona, Texas, Florida, etc. And then if I do a run and I'm scheduled to come back, but I don't have any actual thing to do in chicago that I need to be that foot. I check the weAther at that shit's like under 25. Didn't I just chill where I'm at?

Speaker 5:          01:15:38       I just that look like that's crazy that I call down to the front desk and say extended for two days please. Oh that's a good. Just hang out wherever you're at. Just hang out wherever my oh, go to uh, some other warm place for a couple of. That's how, I mean this is my fIrst time being back for full winter. So that was, that's how I handled it this time where I would just stay up in the life. It's nice man. He lived in a nice loud clap. I rent my place out. It's an apartment buildIng. I read it out when I'm not there. Oh, you do? You're really. Oh, you are frugal. And if people live in your house, do you know these people know? Wow. Airbnb stuff. Stuff there. I'm pretty bare bones when I travel and shit. Just few t shirts. Jeans a couple of days.

Speaker 5:          01:16:21       So your, your apartment in chicago, you don't keep a lot of shit there. I keep just the basic stuff. Tv and the whatever you need. If you're a traveling person, if you be there and then I stayed. When I get back, it's three of them I stayed with in whichever one is open. I block out a couple of days. Oh, you rent, you have three apartments? Yeah. Isn't one building? Yeah, that's weird. Three apartments in one building. Why did you decide to do that? Because it was a. It was. I mean I got it as an investment property. I plan on getting a separate place to stay yet, but that's where I stay now is when I'm there because I'm not that much. That's just like move. Do I sound like a weird, crazy cheap person right now? You sound. I wouldn't say cheap because you do have a $700 watch. I would say frugal. Frugal is the

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       right way to approach this. Yeah. Why not? Why not? Why not?

Speaker 5:          01:17:15       I mean, having them sitting around not generating any income doesn't do anybody any good.

Speaker 3:          01:17:21       Absolutely not. I think it was driving me crazy. Yeah. So you're doing the right thing is a man. I was at a festival called afro punk, a music festival, uh, and it's, uh, it's just a beautiful vessel. Was a all black artists and it's great and people dress up in the wildest outfit. It was a fun time and met the people that put it on. I met them a few years back. they used to come to my show at knitting factory in brooklyn. Jaseline in matthew dope people is so backstage a cello. And I was there with a friend. Somebody introduced me to this lady. She says, oh, I uh, she asked a industry job, oh, I work here and blah blah blah. We love to have you in. And I say, sure, you know, that sounds, that sounds good. I'd like to do. it sounded like an interesting thing to do and so she hands me her phone and I put in my email and my assistant's email and then give her the phone baCk and she was like, you gotta go give your number though. I'll take that as a sign of disrespect. I'm an oji in this game. And I was, I was super high at this point and I was like, what Is happening right now?

Speaker 5:          01:18:44       She took it as a sign of disrespect that you didn't give her your number because I guess he deals with lots of famous people or some shit. So the fact that I just gave her emails, she just,

Speaker 3:          01:18:53       I'd never met them. I met this woman a 90 seconds prior to this part of the inner. It was so

Speaker 5:          01:19:01       yeah, I was so high to where is this really happening right now? I really wanted to work with you and I just gave you

Speaker 3:          01:19:09       the info to get in touch with me. Yeah. Why do we have to talk on the phone? That's less effect. It was suit. And so I'm like, what is that? And then, so, uh, and it's so

Speaker 5:          01:19:19       goes on about that, but with the antibiotic for how long that long, but then she tried to continue the conversation after. It's obvious that her vibe haS changed. When I was in, she went from, hey, was that enough today to a very dry. Oh, so, oh, she continued the conversation. That's not good in this kind of drive. Weird, wet what she said, oh, so you're about to go on this tour with nas and lauryn hill, how do you approach the shows differently? But it's obvious that she just kind of asking them so that you, you. And so I was. So I didn't,

Speaker 3:          01:19:53       I answered it and then she pulls out her phone and she was like, oh my friends over there. And then, uh, she, uh, she, she like goes like this, him. And then I'll just said, all right, I'm outta here. I just walked off somewhere else. But then it was such a weird experience that the comedian in me was hoping she was doing some weird andy kaufman bit because that intense, it was just super weird because everybody was. EveryboDy else was really chill. I, I wasn't even having any network and discussions with people like that there and everybody else was really chill. I don't lIke talking to other people that did that really happen. And so I saw her later, like a couple of hours later I said was well you doing a bit. Was that again? And then she tried to play it like she will, but I could tell she was like, I had to check, you check me for what? And so, but she was really into collecting people. That's what she's really also, she was a interacted with me based on who else she's dealt with in her past versus just interacted with me as an individual. So she was just super salty and I was just so ironic that at this beautiful black festival, the only person beIng weird backstage is a white woman in her forties.

Speaker 4:          01:21:25       Taking that as a sign of disrespect. It was crazy and you must've felt like as soon as she said that like, oh, this, this definitely was the right move. Not to give you my number because you're fucking crazy.

Speaker 3:          01:21:35       Yeah. It was just more like I was wondering now then after I was like, it was mine because sometimes I give, I give random people my number out, have like random I've given, but I don't know what. I don't know. Maybe something that instinct, he knew it just gave it to her, but I've given people in my email before too, but it was just, it was just. Especially since I was super high, I was like,

Speaker 4:          01:21:59       well see the thing is for business though, email's the best way to contact people because you can 100 percent or you can email somebody at three in the morning. It's nothing. Well, yeah. Not only that you can like if you say, hey, we're trying to work out the logistics for this thing in february between February 2nd and fourth, tell us your availabilities so then you can sit in front of a computer and look at my calendar first. My birthday. Happy birthday. Thanks. Look at that shit and you can go, oh, okay, well here's what I've got and you could we. It's, it's clear. It's more having a conversation over the phone that I got to remember. I've got to write it down. Hold on. Let me get a piece of paper or let me dictate it into my phone. Like that's less effective. Especially. It was fucking bitch, but it's a crazy man. It's crazy people out there, man. I've, I've met men and women that do that. They want your number. Then if you don't want to give him your number, they get upset. Well, the reason why you're getting upset is the very reason why I don't want to get my number. I don't want as we live. Yeah. You too excited about getting my number. Someone's got excited about getting your number. You shouldn't give them your number. Yeah, she started name dropping and shit. Fuck that. As soon

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       as they start. Name dropping out a second time. I've done stuff. I'm putting on events for obama. Yes. Call obama right now. Wake him up. That's cool. That's really great. Did you did that? But donald pence for obama, dId obama give you his number? Crazy asshole like obama's given out. Hey, text me anytime. No matter what's going on with the 7 billion people in the world that I'm handling.

Speaker 3:          01:23:30       Yeah. Well maybe she's a troll and she knew that she was becoming a podcast story. Is she that I like to make people. Sometimes I like to make people more calculated than they are. That's like some illuminati shit that's like. I don't think so. I don't think so. I think she's just crazy lady. Just a weird show. Business lady, you know, just a crazy lady. Have you completely.

Speaker 2:          01:23:57       We moved past all the cosby shit or do you still take grief for that?

Speaker 3:          01:24:03       That grief? No, I've uh. Well now you're vindicated. I was sort of a grief. It was just where I would, uh, before to talk about it in situations I, they want to. And also it came out the joke, uh, and that video came out right before we were starting the rollout for my comedy central tv show. And we actually people on, we pushed back my announcement because they're looking opportunist. That news was that crazy that we pushed It back by. Maybe he pushed it back, the premier announced by a month or two because it was that and so, so even though I had my comedy central deal in place this since 2012, I had an all around comedy central deal is. So then when that came out and then I got my show with, well then my show was scheduled to go on the air.

Speaker 3:          01:25:05       It looked like, oh, he did the cosmic joke and then he got a tv show. It's like, no man, this is like my fourth development deal and this is finally to show that I got. Isn't that funny how things work here? But. So that was, that was the thing where instead of, uh, instead of just having this show that I was able to, it was this energy around it, you know, and 2005 july or early 2005. It was this energy around it where if I was going to do press around that time, they were definitely gonna. What year was it? This was 2015. Two years ago. Two thousand five. Sorry. Yeah, 2015, uh, and uh, that show in philly was October, 2014, so yeah, it just kind of really affected the energy around it and as far and, and my m one and an eagerness to do a lot of press just because I knew it was going to come up and I was just like, I was so uh, that was that.

Speaker 3:          01:26:12       I'm not saying that that's the reason my show's not on anymore at all. Excuse me, for people like your show sucks. that's why I like doing the show. I did, I did like aspects of it. I liked the activity part of it was always something to do, you know what I mean? If you like, if you, you face up to show you gotta write, you gotta edit, you got to get the writers to do stuff. You got to um, you know, deal with costumes and it's always a task to do. So. I like just the, that I know for that whatever, what, four months, three, four month period. I was never bored during that time doing. When I do movies, I'm hellebore yeah, I was like movie just because it's no use. Just sit arOund and you go say some stuff. It's like baseball. It's baseball.

Speaker 3:          01:27:06       It's absolutely baseball. If you talk about a 12 hour day that you spend on a movie, shoot is actually for me, 45 minutes, an hour of actual acting and shit and I mean with me maybe 10 minutes of actual acting because I'm not a good actor at all. I'm just saying words, but yeah, it's just shit. It's just mind numbingly boring. But the finished product, the finished product is, it's cool to see and it's dope to be a product, but we're doing it. The director has a lot to, you know, he's moving around and he got a lot of shit to do and so he might yet. But uh, yeah, doing that shit. It's boring. It's very boring. There's no other way to do it though. It seems like it's always that way. Uh, I think it depends on the budget of it. When they got money to burn, then they got time to burn also doing an indie movie, then they ain't going to keep it going.

Speaker 3:          01:28:05       Gonna keep that shit moving. But then yeah, if you're doing a at this one movie band of robbers that's on netflix and it was Just, you know, we were active. What is that? It's a uh, it's time sawyer and huckleberry finn, but in real, in real time, like in current time. Uh, yeah. So I did that and that was, it played a few scenes in that, but it was quick. It was no wasted days. You know, sometimes you go to a movie set. They were like, yeah, get here at 9:00 in the morning. You get there, go through the whole shit, get your hair, make up, get your clothes on and sit around and just sit for a full. I sat for four days full days and then do like, what was the, what the fuck was the plan? They want you there in case they get through a scene, we move onto the next one. Not even anything. When you were like, no, we're not gonna you not know. Do you good for the day? For the whole, for the whole day. Who planned this out

Speaker 2:          01:29:10       now when you were doing a tv show? How many months ago? You said it for like four months. Uh,

Speaker 3:          01:29:16       eight episodes. So it's two months of shooting and then a month or a couple months of pre. Pro? Yeah. And do you, you enjoyed it? I did enjoy. I Just, yeah, I enjoy it. I want to do a. I'll probably do something on tv next year again to a show once I get the idea right and figure out exactly.

Speaker 2:          01:29:34       You think you'd do comedy central comedy central needs to show a. They need something.

Speaker 3:          01:29:39       I do somewhere I'm going to. Do you know what the best choices. I had a good relationship over there still. Um, but we'll see. We'll see what it is.

Speaker 2:          01:29:48       It's so hard to do those things because you got to deal with so many other people. Get so many different cooks in the kitchen. Executives, all these different people hanging out.

Speaker 3:          01:29:58       Well part. I mean they will, they will pretty chill. They were, they would, it was, it will be weird aspects and just weird things that you think you care about this. It'll be a weird line, like why don't you give a shit about this line so much, but they'll let other shit go, but he'll sometimes give notes on something that a st pretty insignificant to me.

Speaker 2:          01:30:27       Yeah, I think a lot of times they just want to justify their existence. They want to justify their paycheck and have some sort of point of view. Even if it doesn't make any sense, they just want to add to it. Yeah, tweak it a little bit. That was my idea when I guess he took his hat off and made it a little nod. That was my idea. Yeah. conference calls is because everybody feels the need to chime in on the call. I've been on conference and I'm like, why am I

Speaker 3:          01:30:51       on this? This? I don't know if I've had a. I don't know if I had a conference call where it just felt really good.

Speaker 2:          01:30:58       F, like website. That was a good conference call. I'm glad I did that shit. Never had a conference call one time I canceled the show. I was supposed to do a, um, a comedy central standup special under the old regime and um, we had a conference call and they went, they had like a transcript of my set and they were going over the material and they're like, well, you definitely can't talk about this in you. You can'T say this. and you can say we got like five minutes into the conversation. I go, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. I'm out. Go am I doing this? And they went, what? I go and I'm not doing this. I don't want to do this. Like there's no way I go, you guys are butcher and everythIng. I go, this is my ass. You know what my act is? You want to cut things out and change things and you like, there's no way this is not happening. Yeah. So thank you though. Appreciate it. And they did. They did. They were stunned. There was a, it was one of those stun conversations. Like what? I was like, yeah, I'm not doing this. Did they? Did they flip though? No, no, it was just a straight up. Well, I, yeah, I was like,

Speaker 4:          01:32:00       we'll go on somewhere else. I'm like, this is crazy. Because one of those conversations were there. It'd been, there were super resistant to controversial shit. This is a, this is what, a few years back. Like I wish I could remember late nineties. No, no, 2005 ish. Six ish. I winded up doing actually a series a. I'm a, I'm a special on netflix that went to showtime. That was 2005, so that's where I wound up doing it. but the conversation on the phone was just like, what they were going over the material. No. Okay. We're gonna have issue with this. You can't say that. He definitely can't say this. I'm sorry. This is just those doing those specials on tv. It's such a bad idea anyway because they're always all broken up.

Speaker 3:          01:32:44       Yeah, yeah. It's, yeah, it's especially for stories. I did my first two with comedy central and they were, they break up your store and you broke up a story. longest story and my second one, if I'm not mistaken, but they all netflix now and they're full, but yeah, they would. I mean they got a. That's how they paid me is that they fucking cell bodies pray. I got to take another piSs real quick. Too much water to drink. Four bottles of water. You might be the new water champ. I'm not going to sit outside to austin. It is 110. Yeah, it's crazy hot here too.

Speaker 4:          01:33:18       It's so hot that I went running and it was burning the bottom of my feet through those five finger shoes. You know? I wear those really thin trail running shoes. Those vibrams that everybody tells me he's gonna. Kill me. People hack like you're gonna die. If you were. Those things look way I tell people, I'm like, dude, you a class action lawsuit. Eastern studies are terrible for you bro. They're not. It's just your body is used to wearing a cast on your feet. Listen to everybody that's worried about those things. I swear If you just use those things and walk for awhile and then like where I'm a little bit and then eventually build up to running with them, you'll be fine, but you have to strengthen your feet. I'm neil brennan said he got plantar fasciitis from running on a treadmill. what those things on those vibram fivefIngers shoes.

Speaker 3:          01:34:09       Yeah. Those are the ones that really stick to your feet. Toe shoes.

Speaker 4:          01:34:14       Yeah. I run with those and they're better for your feet. It's like your. Your foot has to be strong because most of the time when you're running, you're running with running shoes on like have you seen the average pair of running shoes? They have a thick heel and what happened is nike. I think in the seventies whenever they came out with these things, they literally changed the way people run because people started running in, landing with their heel because that's where the big cushion is changed the gate, the natural human gate and to put way more pressure on your knees and people started developing all these issues because of that. The real way to run. It's supposed to. You're supposed to run on the forefoot like landing on the ball of the foot and let the natural structure of your foot decelerate your stride. That's what you're supposed to do, but most people's feet are not conditioned for that because we wear these thick ass sneakers everywhere and those things act as it's like wearing a cast everywhere.

Speaker 4:          01:35:05       That's how it's been described to me. So over the last four or five months I've been running with what they call minimal issues, so there's almost no cushioning. It all. It's very thin and I was saying that it's so hot out that it was running in these things and the bottom of my feet got hot from the just from running on the ground. The ground was so hot. It was it starting to melt or something. Today I could feel that I could feel the heat through the bottom of my feet was hurting. It is actually like burning the bottom of my foot, which by the way, people, if you have dogs, be super fucking careful. Your dogs outside because you're walking your dog on concrete. You could easily burn the shit out of your dog's paws.

Speaker 5:          01:35:41       Just the other day. I just had looked a little bit into it. Uh, the painting, different sections of a asphalt I guess here with, I don't know if it's like white.

Speaker 4:          01:35:50       Yeah. So It's a heat absorbing color instead of black asphalt. Black asphalt apparently just absorbs the heat and reflects the heat. Radiates it around. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:36:02       This is, was dropping like 10 to 15 degrees almost immediately. I was her here. You got 12 degrees just after one coat. YeaH, I've seen that. That's amazing. That's great. And all that as hard as I saw in one article, but it's like 120 degrees. It was getting some places like off sunset boulevard and la, like just in the middle of the day when it's like 85 outside, 90 degrees outside. Makes sense. Really, really extra hot. Yeah, it totally makes sense. Yeah. In all of la is asphalt basically to paint that shit stupid. Yeah. This would change maybe maybe a little bit on your feet. Oh yeah. But you run it on

Speaker 4:          01:36:34       running on dirt. So I'm running up hills, but uh, it was so hot. It was the first time it's ever like, burned the bottom of my feet. Like I could feel it. It was hot. I was like, jesus, I'm not a uh, I don't really jog, but I'm a good judge of form. Are you? I just like a running coach now know if I could coach, but I could just, I could definitely tell you when you're wrong because I see some people like to heavy footed, heavy footage, bad when most people are running on their heels. I see people running and I'm like, wow. It's crazy. When you look around to you look around how many people are wearing shoes with elevated heels? You're like, wow, that's kinda nuts. It's kind of not telling me people just got accustomed to wearing those kinds of sneakers and running

Speaker 5:          01:37:19       people are running basketball shoes or something too. That's lIke, you probably shouldn't be doing that.

Speaker 4:          01:37:23       I think you'd be better off with that. Then you are with running shoes. Just don't land that way. Just to land on your heel. If you went to the ball of your feet basketball shoes, I think she'd be fine, but what the fuck do I know? But you know, I'm running with some really. I run all knee with those. A five finger shoes now or with um, I wear these morels too. They're called vapor or something or like the real thin, too minimalist. Do people ever try to read it? But people probably still will attempt to stop you while you jog, right? Yeah. But I don't do, you can't.

Speaker 4:          01:37:57       That's so crazy. Like I'm in the middle. You're literally going to interrupt a workout. Looks like I've had people come up to me while I'm on the treadmill before, like, hey man, can I get you? I get a photo with you. like definitely not. Now people do it. If you can have a mouthful of food, you could be eating food. I was cutting food up for my daughter and this lady asked me for a picture. I was like, are you crazy? I'm feeding my kid. Like, this is just. People just don't give a fuck. They want to adorn their facebook with something that they saw on tv once. It's weird.

Speaker 5:          01:38:29       Not even printing it up. They don't care. Not even really pregnant usually.

Speaker 4:          01:38:34       Well, they don't even want it that much. It's just like they have a phone and like. It's like if you have a gun, you want to pull the trigger. YOu have a phone and you want to take a picture like how many people do you see at the 4th of July? Taking videos of fireworks. You are never going to watch that fucking video. Who the hell is going to watch a fireworks video like how sad is your life? Have to get where you all have anything better to do than be sitting there watching little lights go off on your foreign screen.

Speaker 5:          01:39:02       Hey man, airport layoffs are real dog. Is that what you do when you're sitting there? LaYover. You know the person that did it. You know when you like. Say you got to lay over in salt lake city. You delayed by five hours to go through your videos and delete all the fireworks once that's clean up. Yeah. You're eating up a lot of gigabytes. You are. When you look at it, you realize how much bullshit as you put shit in the cloud. Yeah. DO you do? I shouldn't know. I know even when I do it, but it's nothing too, too risque. There's a couple risks, but my face isn't in there. That's one thing that's just, you know, face. Would you, uh, I think I asked a friend this yesterday. What would you like, let's say amazon started a g-mail competitor. Would you just like, not just jump over, but like wouldn't it be a good thing maybe to just start fresh with all your email and be like, eh, what do I need that's 20 years old in my emr, 15 years old? Oh yeah, for sure. I don't want it. I want to see it.

Speaker 4:          01:40:06       Definitely. If I look at my email on a daily basis, nine out of 10 things, I get her bullshit. Nine out of 10, one out of 10 I need. and those people, I would just give my new email address anyway, like already did that pretty recently are just changed his email. I'm like, it's good. Move, uh, chAnge your phone. I changed my phone. That's a good move to having more than one phone is a good move to having a phone for people like that fucking lady at that thing was your number. Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:40:33       I don't know that number by heart.

Speaker 4:          01:40:39       I just remembered my number right now by heart and I'm about to change it again. Yeah. Yeah. Just I liked not knowing until I don't care as you know, what else I'd like to. I liked that my vision is going so I can't read things. So like when, uh, when I, if I get like an email or something like that, like I can go. What does it say? Uh, okay. I don't feel held to like read the whole. I don't feel compelled to put my reading glasses and go into depth. I just look at it too. Quick glance. Don't need to pay attention to this as some bullshit. Yeah. Think about some important things.

Speaker 3:          01:41:12       That's, that's a, that's like old man and flaky. See that shit. What's that fucking newspaper? Damn game on? yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:41:24       I don't give a fuck. I'm practicing not giving a fuck. I've always been good at it, but I'm like actively working on it harder and harder more now than ever.

Speaker 3:          01:41:33       It's tough, especially if you're in you're thinking about is tough nuts to not give a fuck, but also be very aware of thinking about the audit time where you have to you if you saying you don't give a fuck, you do give a fuck. [inaudible] you making the choice to be like, I don't give a fuck, but you still do give a fuck. You just like, I'm not going to react in a way as somebody who gives a fuck, but I give a fuck.

Speaker 4:          01:41:56       Yeah. Making a choice though. You know what it's like. It's like I'm pretending I don't give a fuck by saying I don't give a fuck. Yeah. I'm like putting that out there. I'm like making a conscious decision to not give a fuck, but in doing so I'm giving a fuck about not giving a fuck. Yes means you give a fuck.

Speaker 3:          01:42:12       You know who don't give a fuck who locksmiths wise that they don't get locksmith confidence stop. Why don't think of it? Because they can open any door. Because they can open any door and you called them about the laW. I mean, I guess they have to eyeball it and see what it is, but I call it like I've had. I wAs locked out of my In new yoRk and I'll say, uh, come through and tell them that I'll Be there iN five minutes. Once the price, I'll let you know when I'm there. Like, that's confidence, right? I'm gonna tell you when I'm there Because you need to get into your place. That's true. And yeah. And so I've, I've, uh, I've sent locksmiths away just as an actor, too much money, just as an act of aggression. Yeah. When he was like, it's this much. And I was like trying to talk him down and he wasn't having it and he was like, so and I was like, it's fine. It'S all good. And I just sat in my hallway foot. I think I went to the bar a couple of doors down just called another locksmith. How much did you save? Not worth that time. It was good for my spirit. Now

Speaker 4:          01:43:20       did you get a vibe off that dude? Like you sort of, you had a vibe off that lady didn't want to give her your number.

Speaker 3:          01:43:24       There's lIke a five. I just, I think it's just a, cause I've, I just see how quick they can do it and I'm like, I could do that in, you know, like they, they do it in maybe 20, 30 seconds sometimes and I'm like I can learn how to do it in the five minute version of that, how fast they do it and so it makes me, when I see how they do it and it pisses me off to know that he can just break in my shit at anytime and that he's just charging

Speaker 4:          01:43:52       me an arbitrary price because this market is kinda, you know, all over the place. Yeah. Well I guess they have a skill and should get paid for that. Absolutely. Right. So like what, do you remember how much money? It was a hundred 50, let's say a hundred 50. Oh, how to just give him the money. I don't. I'm probably. Yeah, but you like, like you, you, you gotta enjoyment out of saying no.

Speaker 5:          01:44:20       Yeah, because I think he, yeah, I think he's used to mfa would be like short and I'm like, you, well, you know what, you got this skill, you can break into people's houses and shit. I've seen people do this shit fast and I don't, I'm not having it live on a block. I didn't want a black widow, but I'm not in a suburban area. My block in, uh, in brooklyn and williamsburg, I got one of the most lit blocks in this shit to do. It's Just, yeah, it's like four bars just on my very block. Oh, I got time to kill. went down to my local and a play some skeeball hung out. Yeah. Well now how much did you offer to take off? I don't remember the specifics of the negotiation, but it was a very nominal amount. He bought me nothing. Yeah. And he wasn't really budget and shit. Yeah, it was Just, yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:45:08       insight into the mind of hannibal burress. That's how my dad was. Three apartments, rent them out with the airbnb, $700 watch. Big spend. No car, no car won't pay for a locksmith, will pay for a locksmith. Did pay for a lot, but not that one. Not that one. Yeah. How much do you think you saved on the second locksmith?

Speaker 5:          01:45:29       Macho man, but drake money and had some drinks at that bar. Twenty to 30 bucks.

Speaker 4:          01:45:36       Yeah. I kicked in my door once, didn't have my lock, did not my key. Will you with the family? It was just, you know, I was by myself when I was a was pre cell phone days. oh, okay. I thought front kick the shit out of that door and call the dude. yeah. It was like, what happened? I was like, yeah, I didn't have my key. I had to fix the door jam the whole day. That, that little metal thing, that. The thing that waS all bent and fucked up. It's amazing how easy it is to kick open the door. Like when you see those dudes banging their shoulder against the door. If you've got a solid front kick, there's no way that door survives. They just open you. Unless it's a pull for you door. If it's a pull forward toward here, fucked like you got to be able to kick through the door or you have a hard kick butt at a push open door. Super easy. They just open up,

Speaker 5:          01:46:27       you know, you said she was solo solo when you did it, but the, I just still have a locked image of your family with you while you pick up to the door. And the kids like,

Speaker 4:          01:46:39       well if they were crying, they were Crying. I would. I kicked open the door once on a set of news radio and we blamed on the band anthrax. Oh, it wasn't, it wasn't part of a scene. It was just, it was a door to the break room. We were drunk and uh, I was with uh, maura maura tierney and she was like, god, I'm fucking hungry. I want to get in that break room. And I'm like, I can get in that door. And she's like, how are you getting in the door? I go, I'd have to kick it open. She goes, you can kick open that door. I go, yeah. And she goes into it like, all right, here we go. Boom. I just kicked the shit out of that door and it bent the fucking all the shit that like works inside the door. Yeah. And then. But it was so worth it. Is this very shady though to blame it on? That band was wrong. They weren't. They were working on the set that week. They were on the episode with us

Speaker 5:          01:47:27       to this day. Is this an nbc universal? I think we're on sunset gower at the time, I think.

Speaker 4:          01:47:33       Yeah, I just stopped the whole net door. It was a big old metal door to. Did you use to add those guys? Sometimes you need to do some scenes drunk. No, no. This was after the episode. It had been done. So pixilated is that? Yeah, that's them on the derrick. Cool guys though. I hope a production didn't call them because we just were like, who? They were like, who fucked up the door. LIke who knows? And they're like probably that fucking band. Like hm.

Speaker 5:          01:47:59       Probably

Speaker 4:          01:48:00       I would guess it was that band fucked up a door for like $10 in potato chips.

Speaker 5:          01:48:07       Yeah. I was wondering what the, what the take was just not much. Just some chips, snack foods, whatever was available. Good in the moment. Oh, did this. To be able to do that? Feels amazing. Yeah. To be able to kick a door open. My buddy as our gave me this tip about, uh, like when he goes to the movies, he's ordered as a kid's ticket and because the people taking the tickets, they don't look really. They just look at the theater number and a movie. Right. And what I did it the first time it was two tickets, are you saving for bucks or whatever for some change. BuT it felt amazing. It felt like it felt like I'm in any heist, you know, it felt really good. It's like, yeah. It's like don't look, don't look. Yeah. The girl didn't want to do that shit.

Speaker 5:          01:48:59       She was like, why are you doing that? So you're with a girl, you can't do that with a girl. Yes. You can just show them who you are. This is me, I am unreasonably cheap. This is who I am seeing a moVie together, setting the stage two. So like when that prenup come, she understands she's not going to go. I can't believe you brought a prenup. Yeah. She was like, of course, you know me, I cheated them. Any theater to pretend to be a kid for four bucks. Exactly. But that four bucks that sending you, you know, since your brain into a great place, a lot of women really get upset by it. But cheapness, yo, I, uh, I was actually, I was out with this girl in and

Speaker 3:          01:49:47       we, uh, we went to this club, she was driving and we parked in this parking lot. It's like one of those situations where you park in a parking lot. It was a dentist office, but now somebody is charging for it. And so my Immediate question, like five bucks for the parking spot. Right. But my immediate question is, does he, is it, do they have a deal with this dentist office or do they just charge at night for people to park in his dentist off? Because you're not the dentist. Why can you come up? And I was telling him, I'm like, yo, I told her that I was going to say that before we got out the car. I was like, I'm gonna. I'm gonna. Ask him if he's a dentist. I'm not gone. And she was like, and then we'd get out. You're not the dentist. She was like, what the fuck is calling? She was upset that you actually did it. Yeah. And so I was really about, it'd be like, what? Like what's the chances of it getting told like I was really not because of the, I think the cheapest was a part of it, but it was genuinely I wanted to know the reality of the situation. Right. And did they explain to, you know, I just, she was getting upset and I just paid the $5.

Speaker 3:          01:50:56       She got real upset. Not upset, but enough where she wasn't. We didn't have the same sense of humor and a frugality, whereas she, we weren't on the same wavelength as far as that interaction. So she wasn't rolling with me. That trumps a lot of women crazy. Find out that you cheap. Yeah. It was supposed to be bold, like that's one thing that women like that I feel like when dudes make it rain, right. You throw in a bunch of money in the air, you don't give a fuck. There's something about that that like, it's exciting coming up out that strippers like that, but the average women won't like that. Right. That's true. It's, but it's a male move. Talk to make it rain as trip couples a total mail move. Right. It's a saying that you don't give a fuck about money. It's chuck it up in the air.

Speaker 3:          01:51:41       I mean, there's a lot behInd that. I haven't bought out in the strip club like that, but I think the most I've spent in the night in the strip club is maybe 800, something like that. Uh, Which in atlanta is. I spent two months In atlanta this summer. That's pretty low. You know, there's some guys that go and just have 10, 10 grants such and such. This rapper spent 20 grand in the strip club, which is, it's shocking and frightening to me. Uh, yeah. Lana is famous for that, right? Yeah. It's great. Strip clubs in atlanta. I was just there. I was there friday. I was at the tabernacle. Yeah. It's a fun time, man. City man. It's a city. It's a, it's a, it's a good night life. And, but yet the strip club where it says it's a spectacle, you know what I mean? So you just. I mean it's fun, but I went there a few times. Who's throwing money? Who's at a 21? Savage. It's 21 savage, young thug. They are on a stage. Maybe they did a song or something, but it's just

Speaker 5:          01:52:46       a throw money on everybody. See it says. But that is a thing like the flamboyance of not worrying at all about grinding to the point where you just throw it up in the air. Yeah, it was a boxing girl with that. mIght be, that might be king of diamonds. You don't want them. Me on paper. I said atlanta because atlanta up around. Uh, yeah. It's some of the strip clubs. They have girls boxing and king of diamonds in miami. I went there once on a monday. They have girls boxing. It's a huge strip club. I don't like my strip clubs used it over with, I like my strip clubs, kinda like dive bars, like a certain strip clubs. If you walk in and you throw up a couple hundred dollars, like you can kind of take over the energy of the place. Uh, like all the strippers and started coming to you and shit had a small point at a smaller place.

Speaker 5:          01:53:43       King of diamonds. That's where rIck ross hangs out like that. Yeah. Mayweather through something. Then I can see that chemo, diamonds and it has a basketball court. I think we talked about strip clubs last time we were here doing happened. Uh, when they have a basketball court in there. and a barber shop in the strip club. Yeah, a barbershop and a basketball court. Why they have a basketball court? Because sometimes before you want to just get your endorphins going before you throw out of money, I guess. Or maybe the strippers like to play basketball. I don't know. Weird. Interesting. But it's a. The music is great. That's a weird strip cup too because the girls were close. What's going on? I think this is the preamble. This is the youtube version. To get them warmed up. You want to go to vimeo? You can see the, uh, the real deal.

Speaker 4:          01:54:40       Oh, does vimeo show nudity? Yeah. No, it's interesting. What's the rules with twitter? Because I follow some porn stars. Yeah, they, they show full on fucking,

Speaker 5:          01:54:51       uh, I think that's it. You could do it. That's amazing. Sometimes I forget that I followed pornhub on twitter and then I'll be scrolling through and it's just a gift of some, just some part, but. Oh yeah. Well, it's a real

Speaker 4:          01:55:06       problem. If yOu leave your phone around, your kids grab it when they scroll through your feed, like, hey, throw, scroll through the home, feed

Speaker 5:          01:55:13       it. Got it. I mean they to see it somehow.

Speaker 4:          01:55:20       Just one of those animated gif files, 15 seconds of acid deck.

Speaker 5:          01:55:23       Woo.

Speaker 4:          01:55:25       It's amazing that they can have that on twitter with the millions and millions and millions of like, that doesn't bother them.

Speaker 5:          01:55:31       I mean there's worse things on twitter. president. What

Speaker 4:          01:55:36       did you see that, that woman, valerie, I don't know how you say her name is valerie plam or plume. Something like that. she's the cia operative that was outed by, I guess it was dick cheney, I think. Um, it was a big deal, like a because he had said something or husband had said some things that dick cheney out at her and it like compromised her position and compromise the mission she was working on. Anyway, she's working now on buying twitter to kick Donald Trump off. Valerie p l a m e n I do not know how to say no. She's crowdfunding to buy twitter to kickoff Donald Trump. She wants to buy twitter just so they could kick billion dollar goal. She made 85 grand so far by the law. I got news for you, honey. Twitter is not for sale for a billion dollars at twitter for a billion dollar. That's nice. Come back when you've got about $7 billion out of him. Valerie, give that money to houston. Fuck outta here. That'll make it. How much money do you think? Like how much moneY is twitter worth? Like if twitter was going to be for sale, it had to be for sale first. He would have to be lIke $15 billion. Right. Insane potential. But yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:56:46       this is the thing with twitter from the little bit that I know is that it in comparison to the other social medias, they've had travel. Monetize. Yeah. In, uh, in the same way. So like instagram is making money. Facebook obviously making money and his whole body up. Snapchat is doing what twitter hasn't figured out how to get real revenue, like people use twitter and, and are active on it and live tweet events. But as far as the money, it hasn't been. It's been lagging

Speaker 4:          01:57:21       in comparison. Do you understand that? It doesn't make sense to me. Like, like instagram has sponsored tweets with that saY, what are you putting up there? The market value of 15 point 7 billion for twitter a year ago. Yeah. So why is that? Chick thinks she can get it for a billion bucks. She's tripping. She's just trying to get attention, right? Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:57:40       actually smoke. Well, you think it's just, that's just pure, just anger to come up with anger because anger at not just to have the initial weirdo wackadoodle not going to happen. I did, buT because I've had a lot of those didn't calm down. Yeah. So to go through somebody like fucking do a crowdfunding twitter that's so stupid. and then to actually like go onto the site and then write it up. Yeah, put your picture up there. Yeah. And then look at it proofread and go through all that shit and still be like, yeah, still crowdfund for twitter. Still be on board with the idea and post just,

Speaker 4:          01:58:26       it's so stupid because there's 350 million people in this country. if every single person what's mesh? She just wants to become the largest shareholder so she can make the decision. Oh. Which is why the fuck would anybody give her that money? You're giving her that money. like if you gave her 100 grand, how do you. Does she give you an accounting form of what she's doing with that 100 grand? That's so stupid. No one's going to die. I can't believe she got 85 grand. That's amazing in and of itself.

Speaker 3:          01:58:52       Well, the final number at the end, the end of that number is seven, which means somebody gave like $2 or one. Somebody gave a weird off. Now I don't have much, but good luck. yeah. Who's going to give more than five bucks? Let's look at it. Eight because sometimes they show the names of people that, that gave stuff and like what they, uh, what they said. And so let's just see victoria needs. Let's do this now. And what else? Uh, no. the way he tweets, like get this out of office and put them weight can cause damage. $5. Look at that

Speaker 4:          01:59:28       tweet that he made. Look at the tweets. Crawled back up jamie to where it was before. So you could see trump's tweet. We'll get that military solutions and now fully in place. No po, no pay space between comma and locked. So typos galore. Locked and loaded. No comma, no space again. Should North Korea act unwisely? And then douBle space the fuck that's about hopefully kim jong un. We'll find another path. Exclamation point. It's just like, it's like you took some housewife from middle of nowhere and allowed her to be president. I mean, that's literally like the mindset of that tweet. It's just silly tweet. Hopefully he'll find another path.

Speaker 3:          02:00:12       I mean, hopefully he's a is. Are you dIsturbed? I don't know if I'm even disturbed anymore If I'm kinda like, oh, if I'm numb in a. Yeah, in a kind of a. I dunno, like domestic situation where I was just like, yeah, domestic violence. So yeah, yeah, yeah. Like your wife. That's what he said. Yeah. He went to Texas and, and like to see the flood damage and was like, yeah, good crowd. Big crowd. that's what it is. It's kind of crowd.

Speaker 4:          02:00:46       What a crowd here to see me right now? Everybody. Yay.

Speaker 3:          02:00:50       no, I don't think. I don't think I'm disturbed. I just don't think it was. I knew it would be bad. I don't think it would be this, get this bad, this court this quick and yeah, it's really, it's fascinating.

Speaker 4:          02:01:06       The thing that fascinates me the most, it's not just him, but how many people still support him? How many pieces of any problem with it?

Speaker 3:          02:01:13       Yeah, I try to. I can't understand it really with a. They still are behind you behind all of this or is it just where they have a similar. Just the people that are really into him. Are they the same type of just egomaniac or a narcissist is where they can't admit wrong or they know that it's wrong, but that I can't. I'm locked in now.

Speaker 4:          02:01:41       They're locked in. I think they're finding a way to justify whatever he does no matter what it is. Like I had a cow bell yesterday on the podcast. I didn't read. I don't read comments on youtube, but I did look at the thumbs up, thumbs down and it's like he had as many thumbs down as thumbs up. That's super rare and I think a lot of it was because he was talking a lot of shit about trump. We were both were. We were talking about how ridiculous this is and I saw a couple of comments on twitter, people that got mad because we were talking about his response to charlottesville and they were saying he was saying on all sides because there was violence on all sides, like people showed up with torches. They showed up wIth torches for white folks. They were like, we're here for white folks only we have torches like you don't. You don't think that's an issue. You don't think people showing up a line of crazy white supremacists with torches and the people that were opposing them, the people that are opposing them. Yeah, they fucked up too, but the only reason why we're there we're there is because there was people with torches. The whole thing is insane

Speaker 3:          02:02:46       is a and he doesn't have the. I mean he doesn't know how to handle it and I was like, he can't say that publicly. He can say, hey guys,

Speaker 4:          02:02:59       I'm panicking right now. No, he never said that, but he can't say it explicitly, but he kinda says it through his ax. I don't think he's healthy. Also too. I think when you're 70 years old, like you were talking about, like your brain gets older, you're 34, right? I'm 50 now. My brain's getting older for sure. What's it gonna be like in 22, 23 years. So what does he took? Third, 71, 72, something like that. What's that going to be like? Not good. I don't think you should be working all day. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:03:28       That dude, uh, he's too old and he's a, he's a crazy person. And he used to host the apprentice and he was on comedy central roast amongst other things to watch. That's not to say that those things, uh, I mean you can't be solid at a being president, but this guy,

Speaker 4:          02:03:51       you say he still watches five hours of tv a day. That's what I read yesterday. Who reported that? Routers, If I find a bunch of fake news, how could anybody have time to watch five hours of tv a day if you have a real job? Wasn't brand new particle, but trump's session is a first look at that hair. Hilarious. Like that they can just take a photo of his hair. Only black, everything out. That is the most bizarre image of a president. That crazy helmet of hair got mixed it up. when you have a photo editor, it's a good move actually because no president has consumed as much hold on. Nope. Presidents confused as much television in the current one or reacted as quickly or directly to what they're seeing. He loves fox and frIends. Six 24:00 AM monday. Trump gushed over twitter about the amazing reporting and quotes on the morning talk show a week earlier.

Speaker 4:          02:04:47       He instructed the nation to in parenths in quotes, watch fox and friends now for their exemplary really Russia coverage. Exemplary. Really laurie exemplary Russia coverage. He tweeted about the program hosted by steve dewey dokey duty. How do you say that? Juicy, juicy dukie dukie like poo a aynsley. What are these people's names? Ainslie earnhardt and brian kilmeade seven times in march alone. And uh, recently brought up, brought it up in an interview with fox news' tucker carlson, telling him cheerfully. I liked that group of three people even after becoming president. Trump reportedly manages to fIll his days with plenty of television in quotes and from his tweets. It's often possible to discern when and what he's watching, and january, axios broke down the president's media diet. Most mornings, trump flicks on the tv and watch his morning joe, but he hates that guy now. Not anymore. Now he hates that guy.

Speaker 4:          02:05:51       He talk shit about his wife's plastic surgery often for long periods of time, sometimes interrupted with text to the host or panelists. He Texts them after the 6:00 AM hour of joe. He's often onto fox and friends. Wow. What a little cnn before or after, just to fucking get the blood pressure up. He also catches the sunday show, especially meet the press, the shows, as he calls them, often provoke his tweets. The day of our interview with him, all of his tweet topics were discussed and we've discussed during the first two hours of morning, joe, wow. Five hours of television every Day says, yes, I got fIve a day, but too much. And also he is weird that the president is easily debatable on twitter. More so to me, you see when stephen colbert got them and then colby said, you know, mr, president, as much as I think you're terrible, it'd be the president.

Speaker 4:          02:06:51       I thought the very least you understood show business and goes, you responded to me because that means I won. I got you. Yeah. That was when he called, when he called trump's mouth at cock holster for putin. Oh, it as a great job. It was a great joke, but it's crazy like seeing that on a late night talk show, a late night talk show on cbs. The hosts calls the president's mouth. Believe caught. I don't know what they did. They probably it. But you knew what it was. Yeah, a coc. He's saying that he know what he's saying, but the fact that that was in the monologue that cbs is like, yeah, go for it. I mean, no other president do. You would never have that. Not in a million years. The elect, the minimal amount of respect. No fcc fined for stephen colbert. Late night. Donald trump cock holster crack.

Speaker 4:          02:07:46       Wow. Yeah. They believed it was trump trying to go after it for the fcc. Do you remember when the fcc went after howard stern? People forget about that shit. He got fined and he didn't even swear he got fined hundreds of thousands of dollars. Shit. Yeah. How do you think how you think it is his guy? You think he ends his term? You think he dies in office? You think he, uh, uh, he gets impeached. You think what happens with trump? That's a good question. I don't think he gets a second term, but you think he makes it wrong. I think he makes it to the end of the term. Yeah. I think it's just how long wheels on a giant disaster and it gets worse and worse. And I think. Here's the thing that howard stern had a really good point about trump. He said he wants to be loved.

Speaker 4:          02:08:42       He wants people to love him. This is a terrible job if you want people to love you because even the people that supported you, once you get in there, you're trying to do this impossible job there. Really. No one's been able to do totally. People forget that obama had like a very low approval rating too at one point in time in his presidency. I think he was in the low forties, like 44 percent or something like that. Approval rating. Like it's not a job that anybody does. Well, even if you're the best at ever, you still people a giant percentage of the population. Millions and millions of people are going to fucking hate you. That's not, I don't think that's in that guy psyche. Especially if you check twitter like that. Yeah, you can. Yeah, you can block himself from it a when he broke, he blocks regular people when regular people black himself from that.

Speaker 4:          02:09:29       Yes. But just like by delete that off his phone, he can kinda get away from it, but I don't think he could just take that attention away from him. So no, I don't think so either. I just don't think it's healthy for them, especially at this late stage of his life, you know, seventies taking this kind of heat because before he was president, that guy, whether people, some people didn't like, um, some people loved them, no big deal. He was genuinely generally able to like walk around everywhere and not be hated. Like he'd go to restaurant. People go, oh look, there's Donald Trump. There's no, no. People were like hating him. His face kind of a douche bag maybe. I like how you said that. Maybe goes back, whatever. That was tough over there. Nobody was better. Yeah. They might laugh or by try to get a selfie with them and asked him a question, but now the amount of hate he experiences is probably like four or 500 percent more, more even ramped up through the roof. It's a five digit weird number or something crazy quantifiable. Hey

Speaker 2:          02:10:34       man. With the weird hair from the apprentice. Yeah. everybody just wants to take a free shot at them too. Like everywhere he goes, poor bastard. people are building goddamn careers off of hate. The trump, the president's show on comedy central. That's true. God damn cold bear has been founded in the radiance lately because he's been ripping on him because I making that goddamn legacy off of this being an asshole. People mad at fallon because found too nice to him when he was running for president. The hair thing. I mean it was already a done deal. Then you think fallon was gone run? No, but it was that fallon didn't grill him. He didn't. It didn't pressure him. That's when people are mad at that. He didn't treat him like a dangerous person. ProbablY had no idea that he was going to win too. Yeah, it was jokey at that point. Had had play one of those weird games and then cheated. Fuck you with her face. Big smile muscles. His hair up. Uh hm. Very weird. Yeah. It's very weird.

Speaker 2:          02:11:43       It's just so strange that that's our president. It's hard to believe sometimes. LIke sometimes I'll stare at the news and I just have to look at it for like seconds, like 10, 15 seconds. Just go, okay, this is real. This is real. This is the really. Is the president Donald Trump, have you traveled abroad yet? Wouldn't ms. President? Yeah. Italy. Italy to with the fam. Yeah. How was it? Just normal. Nobody gives a shit is normal. There's no. They don't give a fuck. They're over there doing Italy shit. But you were doing a. So use this vacation. No shows. No shows. Yeah. I'm sure if you go some. I've been to Canada to do shows, but I'm sure if you go and do shit. Have I wait a minute? No, I haven't. The first. My shirt first shows with trump as president will be next weekend. Edmonton.

Speaker 2:          02:12:31       Yeah. No, I haven't. I haven't been anywhere while he's actually been the president. It's going to be a trip man. Yeah, they just kinda blamed it on. you would have in the few conversations I've had when I've been out of the country. That was. What are you guys doing over there? Yeah. Well they have a situation that's the exact opposite. They have a super liberal president that was letting in any immigrants and now he's apparently cooled off on that too because doctor having it. Yeah. Trudeau also, they're having issues with free speech, you know, people are getting fined for saying things, they're setting up these weird laws where you can get in deep shit for ms dot gendering. People not using the correct gender pronouns, one of 78 different gender pronouns that people use now. LIke they're super ultra left wing, like his cabinet and his ideas. He's a real like legitimate social justice

Speaker 4:          02:13:32       warrior president. So it's interesting. It's like, yeah, both schools, right? Right next to each other desk. Both of them are kind of fucked.

Speaker 3:          02:13:42       yeah. Yeah. Wait, we did it.

Speaker 4:          02:13:46       They did it to Russia. Did it. Nobody should fucking be president meant nobody shouldn't be president. Oh, heartache. We need more. We need a group of humans as a group of 12. Yeah. Caligiuri. Yeah. Yeah. Something like that. Yeah. And uh, a group oF intelligent people that are qualified, like with like a great education, excellent ethics, great morals. You can't have just a popularity contest to see who gets to control the nukes. It's fucking crazy. I hope we get at. I hope we get past it, but I don't think we're going to. I think once we have things written on paper, once we have like a way that we operate, once we have some sort of a plan that we follow, it's very difficult to get to people to shake that too, to have some sort of a new reasonable plan to run the country without representative government, you know, like senators and congressmen and people that you have to like it mean they had all that shit back when they couldn't get ahold of people.

Speaker 4:          02:14:47       I mean, theY had all the, all that stuff was. And I'm not saying that there shouldn't be some representatives. I'm saying that the system that's in place right noW was really in place right now because you had a representative every state and they had to travel to dc and they did their business. Then they come back to their constituents. Will, the constituents can all communicate in real time. Now. I mean, we have this, uh, uh, unique ability now to share your opinions and even to vote online. That also should be an option 100 percent. We should be voting online.

Speaker 3:          02:15:13       Uh, I don't know about that. That could be,

Speaker 4:          02:15:17       that could be easily. I mean if the picks on the cloud, he's worried about people voting online.

Speaker 5:          02:15:21       Listen, who knows? That's just a dark dick. The bad guy be anybody's hasn't played a voice, a voice that's saying anything that is fake neWs. Fake news, ruder photo shopped

Speaker 4:          02:15:42       better. System is possible. This is not the best system. I feel like this is like trying to patch up windows 95 over and over again. Just come up with a new yes,

Speaker 5:          02:15:51       a couple of years old. Come up, mix it up, mix it up. But you know, that's gonna take a lot of time. A lot of time to do what's in the notes, man. We gotta do it. All right. Everything a pretty. We got to it organically. Yeah, I mean, yeah, I didn't try it. I didn't. I'm not a, you know, I'm not a hammer it in type. You know what I did the morning radio type of unit. That's the worst. Oh, so what do you want to talk about those still do, do morning radio shows? Uh, no I haven't done them in aWhile. I, I'll, uh, no, and

Speaker 3:          02:16:30       I don't even those call in and I understand that you were at a baseball game or a baseball game. Baseball. Super boring. No, we got through everything except for weirdly the one. Uh, you know, congratulations on a thousand episodes. Thanks. By the way, I started a podcast last year. Oh, that's right. Yeah. Handsome rambler. Who? It's really nice. It was a high name. I'm locked into it now. Consider changing it. It's fun. No, it's been good. Do you have guests have guests on do it? We do it all over. We do it like we, it's me and my dj tony trimm. Uh, so we do a lot of them in chicago, but we travel and yeah, it's uh, we, we have comedians and we have a lot of musicians on. We one for you to do it. I do. We put them out every week, but we block record them just because I'm usually traveling a lot.

Speaker 3:          02:17:24       So we just, we have a chairman and we got, we do make goofy songs. We set, that's a, that's tony's crypt and chicago. Oh, that's nice setup there. Yeah. So we, we played some songs and shit and goof off and do some interview stuff. It's a fun time though. It's been good. Nice. It's kinda, it's kinda changed, you know, uh, how I, I feel like I'm a. When I talked to people I feel like a better person, not because I have a podcast, but I feel like I'm more in tune with what a person is saying. Yeah. We're like, am I ended up accidentally interviewing people when you talk to them in real life, but like asking good, quite weird like nat and a practicing way where I ended up talking to people but asking better questions then the where you from. So the, the getting beyond the surface level. So I think that's happened because of that.

Speaker 2:          02:18:23       Well I, I feel like the same thing with me. I've learned how to be a better conversation with you evolve for sure. You also learn what's annoying about your speech patterns. Oh, you say a lot of years. Yeah, that's what I say. Like a lot. Like it's like there's like, you know, you know, and like those are big ones. yeah. You know, like, and yeah, because I just say three years, five seconds. We, you also learned how bad, like a lot of regular people are at having actual conversations. A lot of people just waiting for you to stop talking so they can talk like they're barely paying attention to what you're saying. Yeah. Yeah. Being a good conversationalist. It's huge. Is

Speaker 3:          02:19:07       A lot of tools.

Speaker 2:          02:19:09       Yeah. Did you, did you read books and shit when you first started or did you just go into it or did you, did you study certain people when you, as you went along or when you first started? No, no, no. Total trial and error. Just doing it a lot. you know, in a thousand episodes we've done a thousand episodes

Speaker 4:          02:19:28       plus another 40 that were like fight companions, podcasts on a plane, podcasts on a hike. There's a bunch of dIfferent ones. Fight breakdowns.

Speaker 3:          02:19:38       How often do you listen to it? What do you watch?

Speaker 4:          02:19:40       I listened to occasionally I listened to one if I think it sucks. If I think I was bad or if I think, uh, the person said something super interesting, like there was one the other day with Sean Carroll. He's an astrophysicist and a, he's a, an expert and quantum theory and it's just shit. He was saying it's so hard to grab a hold of. I had to listen to it several times then. Yeah. But it's mostly just me asking questions and hear him talk and. But it's just the stuff that he's saying is so intense, you got to kind of listen to it over and over again with my feeble little brain just to try to store it, you know, like, okay, what is he saying? And there's another one, this woman that she's on all the time, rhonda, patrick, dr rhonda, patrick specialty, um, nutritional absorption and just, uh, how nutrients affect the body.

Speaker 4:          02:20:30       That's the big thing with her. And she's, she's one of the smartest people I've ever talked to him. He's freaky smart, like, like almost like an alien, like you talking to and you realize how dumb you are because you can ask her a question about something and not only can she tell you what it is, she'll recite the studies that were done and what percentages? The studies and it's just pulling this right out of it in between our ears. She's not. Nope. Nope, pewter into. She has notes but she rarelY uses them when she comes on the podcast. She'll like, have something that she wants to talk about some new study on, like, you know, like broccoli sprouts was one that she went over the last time because she's been experimenting with broccoli sprouts and she's a clinical researcher as well, so she does actual scientific research. So she's one of them that I listened to like several times to try to remember what the fuck she was saying.

Speaker 3:          02:21:17       So does she hit you up the same way? I actually, joe got this broccoli sprouts shit I need to get off sometimes. Yeah. Sometimes

Speaker 4:          02:21:27       say I'll hit her up too because she's a researcher too, because she's always like a, for lack of a better word, balls deep in research and she, she's like, sometimes she doesn't have time to do podcasts. He's in the middle of so many different things that she's working on. Actual science, you know, that's the interesting thing about having real scientists on as you realize like what a different world they live in.

Speaker 3:          02:21:49       Absolutely. I would never have a scientist. You might enjoy it maybe down the line, but right now I keep it to five pula. Yeah. Keep It fun and people I know and I think it may be down in line as I grow at it. Then I be able to carry that kind of conversation with confidence or at least lead them into what they want to say and, and, and asking engaging questions during it. But for right now, keeping it, rappers, comedians, musicians,

Speaker 4:          02:22:19       is fun. Some of my favorite podcasts that I do, or like comedians, like yourself or my friends or um, one thing I cAn tell you though, looking at that image of you guys, this is what a mistake that we did when we first started out. We did it on couches. Problem with couches is you got to like sit forward where the microphone is not that comfortable. Like I realized after awhile, I see how you guys are like, everybody's leaning forward looking at that. See like on this show, you're sitting in these ergonomic office chairs. You're sitting in the back and, but you're sitting up and you could sit here for hours and hours at a time. If you do three hours, sit the way byron powers is right there. That shit's gonna hurt your back.

Speaker 5:          02:22:58       Oh, well we, we, we keep about an hour and a half or so

Speaker 4:          02:23:02       hour and a half's good. Yeah, that's right when it starts swing. But like office chairs are the way to go. There's a reason why they make these things like, especially these ergonomic ones, these are from a ergo depot. They're called capisce [inaudible]. For people that ask and they're, um, they're not a sponsor or anything, they just, they're bad ass chairs and they force you to sit up straight so you can sit in these for hours and it doesn't fuck with your back. Solid tip, joe rogan. Solid tip. I appreciate it. I made those mistakes. I had a couch and ari shaffir took that couch. He sold it. I gave it to him and he did something with it. I think he evaded or something that everybody knows the couch. look at this. Go on here.

Speaker 5:          02:23:41       Oh, it's happening here. That's uh, we went, uh, mogue fest. What does that mogue fest. Moga is the company they make synthesizes. So a lot of bands you'll see they use milk products. And so, um, that there are many that we use on a podcast, you know, that there are many is the instrument that you can operate with waves, like just you move your hands around it. They make that. And so tony, my, he said, oh, we should go to mogue fest. And so I could be. That's a good idea. That had festivals in durham. So I reached out to them and they, uh, they said she'll come to the fast and we did a couple of podcasts there and then also they have a, a, a, a, a workshop where you can build your own drum synthesizer. So it's a two day workshop where you built it, they give you all the parts and you build it from scratch and you do all the solder it and school. So I built this a drum at the size of it. It may.

Speaker 4:          02:24:41       Is that what you're doing there? Is that what's in your hand? That's a, at that point you have soldering right there. Yeah. So that's like a. What is that? What are those boards called?

Speaker 5:          02:24:53       Circuit boards. Circuit board. Yeah. So yeah, we both worked on, I didn't do all the work, but uh, I did a lot of. That was my first time soldering anything was doing. I hadn't done actual building shit with my hands in a long time, but yeah. Then we, uh, then when we built them all, everybody built their as an in, at the end of the class, linked them all together and they just, it just kinda fucked around with them and just make crazy noise. Wow. Yeah, that's interesting. It was fun, man. That seems pretty bad ass. Yeah. Making your own sense. So that's a cool. What does, just off a whim, you just decided to go and do that? Well, we were, cause yeah, we just a, I looked it up and it was a bunch of artists that I liked there too. And so it just, and we reached out to that was kind of a chill festival is it, have some bigger artists, but it's still pretty small in the way that we were able to hit them up a few weeks before and they were able to accommodate us with time slots and say okay, they will already have somebody interview flying lotus.

Speaker 5:          02:25:58       So they had us intervieW him and uh, we interview animal collective and they were pretty low. It was just loosen and, and chill and it was easy to navigate. It was a, it was a fun festival. Yeah, it was just on a whim. So do you use that thing now? That's kind to be like kind of satisfying knowing that you made something and I haven't used it yet because it's set my, I had to get it from, from New York and uh, bring it to chicago and started using it. I use the theremin mordo that there, ms.fun. So like what do you make music? We make songs on the podcast. We do a, instead of doing an ad read, we do a, we do a jingle for you to do an original song for each ad. So you write the songs that you like, what their talking points. Uh, we do well, we do the, we do the song and it's kind of hooky. Usually just based is saying the same like we got bev was one our sponsor, so we go blah, blah blah blah blah blah. And he'll produce around it. and then we'll do to read after the, uh, the saw this is that there are many that he's talking about to wave your hands over it and it makes music, millimeter stereo headphone out.

Speaker 5:          02:27:12       The other antenna will control that hand technique. I usually do a full openhand that's mars shit. It's real weird. That's a weird, weird thing. But it's fun man in it. so we've made some beats with that. That's fascinating. I've never heard of this thing before. Yeah, we really used that. I mean we have an tonio, he'll have a drum machine. We got a microphone that does like auto tune and stuff. Wow. So it's really to cover up that we're a bad interviews, you'll be alone and we can't take us out. He was like, it just started goofing off and make it a. So do you think like you'd probably not an interview. Are you just having a conversation? Right? Yeah. Well how many podcasts are really, right? Absolutely. But I, I just, uh, I could talk, you know what I mean? But I also want to be, when I, when I have a guest, I want to like put them in a position to shot, you know what I mean? And so sometimes I'll catch myself kind of going off and I'm like, oh shit, let me get it back to them. You know what I mean?

Speaker 5:          02:28:20       We use that thing. what? No, I'll catch myself going off onto a, uh, into a long ass story to now realize that. Let me just bring it back and get it to a.

Speaker 2:          02:28:29       So this guest. Yeah, that's what I mean. Yeah. That's fun. It's fun. No, it's a fun time. as long as it's fun, man. That's everything. do you find that like a lot of people that are coming to your shows, they, uh, they listen to the podcast and it's sort of like gets you closer to them?

Speaker 5:          02:28:42       Yeah, it is where we get a lot of messages about it and people say they've bought their minis because you're like, I didn't, I didn't even know what a theremin he was, but now I want one because they play it so god goddamn much. And it's kind of a running theme on the show were the guest of a what is that thing and be like, hey, that's a therapist. So It's just kind of a, it's almost like a third host of the show when the person finds out what it is. And I explained it pretty much

Speaker 2:          02:29:14       every time. It's a fun time. And uh, so tell people that it's handsome, rambler, itunes, soundcloud, the other ones. what is it? What else you got? What is it like google play, google play, play. It's amazing how few people bring up google play because like half the people have android dome thing isn't like google play never gets discussed. And you can get google play on an iphone too, right? but you can't get itunes. can you get itunes on an android phone? You can't get the podcasts on google play on the iphone because there's a podcast app which google apps on the phone or whatever. They don't let you. But they let you use some podcast apps, right? I don't know, just that comedy podcasts app, that arch fear is always, is different though. That's a comedy app that's aggregating. Let's see how many things. They wouldn't let you choose an actual podcast app other than there? I don't think so. I could be speaking, but I don't think so. Yeah, man, it's a tough road for those android people. It's tough road. People just look at you illegitimately if you green text message, but yeah, they get weirded out by here.

Speaker 2:          02:30:26       You bought one, you get crazy red. The cameras really made one day to sit down and I was like, ooh. It looks tremendous. They made an android phone. It hasn't. They just showed up. Put up a picture where you can only see like the corner and the rest of it's all shaded out. I'll see if I can find it real quick. No, that dude, marcus got ahold of one and then I saw the video but I already bought it before. Now I just kind of went ahead and because they had some wording on the bottom that like there's gonna be some special things that you won't be able to buy if you don't Buy in this window. It was a whole sales pitch, but like I just went ahead and bought a house. So you're going to switch over to android. That switch. It'll just be like a second.

Speaker 2:          02:31:00       Whoa. Phone. You're gonna have a whole phone. It doesn't work. I'll sell it and just what it's supposed to also be a modular something or other. For the new cameras they're going to have coming out too, so it'll actually be a physical tool. It's more or less Just a five inch screen. That's a tool for these. These cameras that don't have any screens on those red cameras for people don't know. There's a lot of television shows a good with those like super high end high definition. Top of the food chain caMeras. that new phone does look dope and it's got like these crazy grips on the side of it. Like the side of it is not smooth. It's got like finger holes, like where your. Your hanD grips onto it. What they had to been doing great as a camera company where they said let's do phones also holographic. Yeah. Well marcus is the video. What is marcus's last name? Brownlee. There was a video where marcus is watching it and he's like, whoa, you can't show you that. It looks like he said he can't show you. Goes, you can tell shit. You could see my reaction to it and by the way, he's like, the reaction is not even to the finished product, which would be even better than it is now, but you see how the aside edges have those weird grips to it. It's really kind of interesting.

Speaker 2:          02:32:07       Yeah, he's a mess and with it. But you could see like when he's holding it in his hand, like what it looks like. Is that it just talking about it? I think that's a different video than the one I saw. Maybe it's not. He was on a couch. Yeah, there it is. And you see the thing, it doesn't look like any other phone you've ever seen before. Like yeAh, there you go. Like see the sides of it. It's all like, it's got like ripples. Like finger slots. Yeah, real big too. Huge. Bigger than life. But he's got big hands so you can't tell as much. I got tiny hands. I'd be trapped in this shit. To you. which one do you have? A regular iphone? Yeah. I didn't get the one because my hands can't enter this shit. You got to end it, but there's so much.

Speaker 2:          02:32:56       It's so worth it. If you go online, like if you go online, you want to read something online, it's just so much better with the big screen. It's just the experience and looking at pictures and videos of fireworks and shit. Holographic displays. Interesting. I'm a little worried too that they announced something they won't be able to deliver on, which happens from time to time. Oh, jamie'S mr. Pegaworld, size difference. The uh, the red marketing person went from really excited to go a full on hype piece until, I don't know if they're going to be able to do it. you're going to get a bunch of ads on twitter was like zero posts. Like fuck you, you piece of shit. Yeah. There's um, at galaxy note eight looks insane too. That's coming out real soon. That's like almost out. They don't still make the airplane announcements.

Speaker 2:          02:33:45       No, that was a seven. Yeah. They don't make it anymore. Pretty much everybody's got rid of that thing. If you're a hold out, you're like, oh fuck, I charge it. But I charged it up, take a pot from my, uh, from my stove. I charged in that fucking thing. Just gauging catches fire, put it in the fireplace. You see that little video showing how people to, if they're in the floods, how to charge their phones off of a nine volt battery and a, and a in a key. Yeah, it lookS sketchy. But in a nine volt battery, uh, put the in a car charger. I'm on the internet too much.

Speaker 5:          02:34:31       It's unplugged. Does happen. Oh, it was a different lady I saw.

Speaker 2:          02:34:37       Okay. So she's got a car charger and she takes the car charger and sticks on the end of a nine volt battery, like One, one of the slots and then puts a key in the other slot and I think you've got to touch it. You get the circuit. What if this lady just burst into flames and lost her islands so you can get electrocuted by doing this. So yeah, be careful. But It's a nine volt battery. You can. And obviously won't be a big charge, I don't think, but it will charge the phone. so she touches the two of them together. Wow. That works. That's crazy. That's nuts. So if you're in a pinch and all you got to nine volt battery and you need to call nine slash 11, they make a battery adapter for an iphone. Why don't they make a little thing where you can plug a nine volt battery into it. Just go to a store, buy a battery, plugged that fucker in and charge your phone. Does anybody have that? How do they not have that? Because they have those banks, you know, there's a power bank so that you can plug your shit into.

Speaker 2:          02:35:36       Have you seen that new, um, a luggage that you could ride? Have you seen that shit? Turns it into a scooter. Yes. Yeah. Hey, that's fucking amazing. What does that, I don't know. I re tweeted it the other day though, was on mashable and I was like, get the fuck out of here. The thing goes eight miles an hour. You sit on a fucker and you ride around the airport with it as a. It's legit. I said related. That's one way to stunt. That's one way to handle a layover. just drive around the airport until your, your luggage runs out of batteries, but you can also use the battery charging of that, the battery and use It to charge your phone. Like you can plug your phone into that. That alone is worth it. Like always having battery power, right? They're connected to your luggage. That's a lot of the. A lot of these, uh, luggages are doing that now. Look at that. Get the fuck out of here. And that's a carry on. Yes. People having a good old time. I have to go.

Go up? And then
