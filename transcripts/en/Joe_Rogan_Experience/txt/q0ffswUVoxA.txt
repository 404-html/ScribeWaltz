Speaker 1:          00:00:03       Three, two, one, boom. And we're live. Hello, Gary Hydro. Thanks for coming man. Appreciate it. My pleasure. The case against sugar. Yeah. This is a for me. This is a up. I don't know how to put this any other way. I've, I've kind of consumed sugar most of my life until the last couple of years and I slowly sort of tapered off and about about a year ago, maybe last February or so. I just pretty much cut it all out except for the occasional occasional dessert here. They're infinitely better quality of life. I feel much better. I have more energy and then I started really getting into it and then I came across your work and um, what I want to know is first of all, how did you get involved in this and how much resistance have you fixed? Okay. This being the sugarcane, this being the whole obesity diet, nutrition, we can get into all of it, but the sugar one to me is absolutely fascinating when you go down. I mean, if you've seen that sugar movie. Yeah, yeah. Probably in it I think. I think you ought to come onto the talking cereal boxes. Oh, okay. Right now, um, I will, I've watched it with my kids. I'm, I made my kids watch it and it's amazing when, you know, a six year old watches, something like that. And then they go, why is sugar in everything?

Speaker 2:          00:01:22       You know, it's funny because my kids lived with this all the time, right. So we had just come back from spending the holidays with my grandmother who pumps them up with sugar while we're there and there's nothing I can do with it. Then we'd get back and I'm having them making my boy's dinner. They're eight and 11 and uh, my wife's out and after the dinner, my eight year old says or weakened desert and my 11 year old goes, yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:01:45       nic, it's dad, man, are you crazy? Wake up son. Anyway, I got into this, you know, I. okay. I was a physics major in college.

Speaker 2:          00:01:57       Shows was like hard science and then I wasn't any good at. I got a c minus and quantum physics and my advisor suggested I find another career. So went into journalism, started doing science writing in the early eighties because it was the only work I could get. And then my first book I went to live at cern, the big particle accelerator lab outside of Geneva and I was what we would call today embedded with the physicists and I thought it was going to be following. I'm making this great discovery, which is what the Nobel laureate who ran the experiment was predicting and instead I spent 10 months watching them figure out how they screwed up. Okay. And it was a learning experience in how to do science right. And I was obsessed with how hard it is to do good science and I had a lot of the physicists in the world really didn't like this Nobel laureate, so they were happy to point out to me how he was screwing up and how he screwed up in the past and how he even screwed up the work that he won the Nobel prize for.

Speaker 2:          00:02:50       Um, after I came back I thought that was actually paid six and the New York Post, when my book came out, the headline was Aig had over Nobel prize and this Nobel laureate who was calling me an asshole in the newspaper and I'm 29 years old. Nice. Assume my Jordan, you know, my career over. What was he calling you? An asshole over. Well, because I ended up writing an expo say, but what a bad scientist. He was about the politics of science, you know, I thought I was, I went to Stockholm with this guy when he won the Nobel prize. I mean we got our talks is fitted together. I was a guest at the Nobel dinner and the Nobel banquet and the party that follows, which is the most fun I've ever had in my life. Um, students, Stockholm, throw a party for the laureates and it's, back then it was crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:03:36       Um, anyway, so he was justifiably pissed off that I just wrote what I saw instead of what a great man he thought he was. And I thought my career was going to be over right. You're called an asshole. And the papers when you were 29 year old journalists by Nobel laureate, but instead everybody I would interview in science would say, Oh, you think that guy was bad, you should write about this guy. And I just started covering different aspects and it turns out you could get along way in science if you're willing to sort of cut corners. And then it's not actually cheating, it's just you could discover a lot of stuff if you're not willing to do the rigorous, hard, critical, skeptical work to demonstrate that. Would you say you have discovered is wrong. Okay. So I wrote a book about something called Cold Fusion, which was a great scientific fiasco of the 20th century except for the stuff I'm writing about now.

Speaker 2:          00:04:30       And some of my friends in the physics community said, if you're interested in bad science book was called bad science. He said, you should look at this stuff in public health because it's terrible. And so I moved into public health beginning with this idea that electromagnetic fields from power lines will cause brain cancer, leukemia and everything. I had learned about what you, how rigorous and meticulous and skeptical and thoughtful you had to do to get the right answer and physics. The public health people didn't think it had to do. They thought it was kind of a luxury because their science is harder and it is kind of harder. You're dealing with like chronic diseases that happen over decades and people and messy systems and you can't measure anything and everything I had learned was that if you don't do this stuff, you get the wrong answer.

Speaker 2:          00:05:17       So by the late nineties I had stumbled into nutrition research and this is maybe a longer story than you want it. No, I was living here in Venice, California. I was freelancing for the journal Science, so was what's called a contributing correspondent and I needed a paycheck to pay my rent. So I called my editor and I said, what do you got? What kind of story could I turn over quickly? And he said there was a diet study that was coming out in the New England Journal of Medicine in two weeks and they want to do an article about him and I didn't know is that this diet study had been leaked to science and advance and the person who leaked that had given them a list of sources to talk to who leaks a diet study right, to a trial. And this was a dash diet, dietary approaches to stop hypertension, which is the most today, US news and World Report says it's the healthiest diet in the world based on, you know, like force studies that did not demonstrate anything.

Speaker 2:          00:06:15       Um, the way you do those stories as a journalist is you interview the principal investigator and you ask him who to talk to when he gives you a couple of names to talk to who can talk about the study even though it's published. And then you get three interviews, which is enough to justify a page in the magazine and you get your paycheck. Um, so I interviewed the Pie and then I interviewed one of the people on the list of documents that had been leaked to science and that was a former president of the American heart association, and she told me she couldn't talk about this study or she'd lose her funding. And I said, come on man, this isn't Sanko era. Soviet Union people don't lose their funding for talking to a journalist about a diet study. And she refused to talk to me. I said, let's go off the record, complete confidentiality if I'm going to miss a story that you're not telling me that's bad, couldn't get her to talk.

Speaker 2:          00:07:06       And then I call one of the people that the Pi told me to talk to and he sounded exactly like Walter Matthau on the other side of the telephone was very weird and Walter's starts yelling at me that there's no controversy over solid and high blood pressure. And I'm going. But Walter, I'm not calling about salt and high blood pressure. I'm calling about this dash diet coming out. And these keeps going on. There's no controversy, there's no evidence. It's all doesn't cause high blood pressure. So I get off the phone, I call up my editor, I said I'm going to finish this story, but I had this former Aha presidency. She couldn't talk to me and if she loses her funding. And then I had Walter Matthau yelling at me that um, there's no controversy over in the high blood pressure. There must be a controversy over whether salt causes high blood pressure.

Speaker 2:          00:07:52       Right? So I'm going to turn this story and pay my rent. And then I spent the next nine months doing an investigation for science. I interviewed I think 85 sources for one magazine article. Got paid for like six weeks, pissed off my fiance at the time because she thought she's going to date someone. They should have a better sort of, you know, work efficiency ratio. Um, the conclusion was that the only way you would believe that salt causes high blood pressure from the studies that had been done to that point was if God told you so perf personally. So you could ignore all the evidence and all the randomized control trials name and the observational evidence. And just, but that's what everyone had done.

Speaker 1:          00:08:36       Well, how did this start? Because I had heard that before as well. Everybody's heard that before and I had read a long time ago that that was bullshit and that salt is actually an essential mineral and it's important for your body and it doesn't cause high blood pressure and there's a host of other factors should be considered. So it was, yeah, that's the thing. It was kind intuitively.

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       It was an interesting idea. Make biological sense. When you consume salt, you also have to take in water. That's why they feed pretzels and you know, salty peanuts at bars because you want to take in liquids so that you can maintain the same sodium concentration in your blood because your cells like the, you know, the chemical reactions that drive your cells are dependent on the sodium ratio in the cells. So if you take in more salt, you're going to drink more fluid and that you're going to have in a more fluid in your circulation. That's going to increase your blood pressure. And it does happen in a very short term. But the question is this, a chronic cause of high blood pressure and hypertension and once the researchers decided was, and these guys are terrible scientists, I mean, I hate to say this, but in my first book, good calories, bad calories, in the epilogue, I pointed out, I say, you know, I never used the word scientist to describe any of these people doing research except for a few specific examples because they don't really understand what science is and how to do it.

Speaker 2:          00:09:57       And they weren't to their defense, they just were never taught how to be scientists or physicians and nutritionists who had a sloppy scientific training and they thought it was easy and you get a hypothesis and you confirm the hypothesis. And when he didn't confirm it, they thought it must be true anyway. And then you find the data. When people talk about Cherry picking, that means you find that data that does sort of confirm and you ignore the rest. So anyway, that was it. I wrote this article is called the political science of salt, you know, won some awards. And while I was doing that, uh, it's Walter Matthau character took credit not just for getting Americans to eat less salt, putting us on this low salt diet. He took credit for getting us on the low fat diet that we were all waiting in the nineties and I got off the phone with them, called my editor at science and I said, when I'm done writing about salt, I'm going to write about fat.

Speaker 2:          00:10:51       I have no idea what the story is, but this guy is clearly one of the five were scientists I've ever interviewed in my life. And you know, everything I learned in my physics period was at bad scientists never get the right answer. So I spent a year doing an investigation for the journal Science on dietary fat that paid for about two months. And it seems to be a trend here. Yeah, it was bad. No, it's good. It's good. You got to do that to get the right answer. That's. Yeah. And that's why so much has journalism is so shallow is because if you're gonna put in the time you get paid for, it's all you can do as a shallow job. Nobody can afford to do that. I actually had corporate jobs that allowed me, you know, like writing speeches and press releases for IBM that, you know, I really hated doing, but that paid well and like that was my corporate work so I could do the pro bono stuff I cared about.

Speaker 2:          00:11:45       Anyway, that's. That story was the same unless God told you personally. So I ended up doing this cover story for the New York Times magazine called what if it's all been a big fat lie, which came out July 2002. It was probably the most, one of the top five most controversial articles ever ran. And the idea was I wanted to see what caused the obesity epidemic. That was what I pitched to the editor, but we had this idea that you get fat from eating dietary fat. That was actually the primary logic behind putting the country on low fat diets. They thought it might help heart disease, but they hadn't been able to show it in trials, but they just assumed if we ate less fat, we'd lose weight because fat, denser calories, and there was always this competing hypothesis that had been buried and swept aside and ignored and you know, inhibited which was at the problem is the carbohydrates, particularly sugar and refined grains.

Speaker 2:          00:12:44       And so when I got this cover story, I got a big book advance. Finally I could afford to do the book I wanted it paid for four years of my life. The book took five. Again, same financial issues. But um, and I love it because people accused me of like, I was just going to write anything I could find for a paycheck. And I finally got a big paycheck. And so now one of the ideas there that emerged out of my research. So even when I wrote the 2002 piece, I thought that we got fat because we ate too much. You know there's a line in that article piece to it, of course has caused by consuming too many calories and we can more calories than we consume.

Speaker 2:          00:13:25       By the time I was done with this book, I thought that was one of the most inane scientific ideas that had ever come along. I mean, it's almost incomprehensible to me even though I know exactly the history of the idea and where it came from and why we believe that it's just crazy naive, so that's the one that I get the feedback on because I'm out there saying so 99 percent of obesity researchers and nutritionists and all our public health policy is based fundamentally on this concept that we get because we eat too much or too sedentary and what I was saying was not only is that naive and meaningless, it's a description. It's not an explanation and we could go into that. Clearly. Obesity is a hormonal metabolic defect and in fact the best scientists in the world prior to World War Two, the best far and away the best medical science was done in Germany and Austria in Europe.

Speaker 2:          00:14:18       The US was a backwater of medical science until postwar just, it was a backwater, virtually all science and these guys had concluded that obesity had to be a metabolic hormonal defect, but the American doctors were saying, Oh man, the hormonal thing obesity's Ramona was an excuse for fat people to not eat in moderation and run marathons like a saline people do, and what I did is I brought that hypothesis sort of advantage with the war literally evaporated with the war. The German Austrian medical community evaporated. We wanted nothing to do with these researchers. The Ivy League universities had policies in place to keep from being overrun by Jewish academicians from Europe, so then physics, we embrace them because we had bombs to build in a cold war to fight, but medicine and public health, we wanted nothing to do with them. So this hypothesis evaporates and postwar.

Speaker 2:          00:15:13       You get this creation of basically obesity research created Denovo by these. Like the young doctors have no scientific training who are leaving, who hate the German, so they're not going to pope the German literature, even if they read it and nutritionists who do animal research and never even studied obese people. And you get this idea that it's an eating. You know, it's a calorie overconsumption problem by the 19 sixties. The field is dominated by psychologists and psychiatrists who are studying ways to get obese people to just stop eating so damn much. They didn't try to make them exercise back then. That was kind of torture they would push later. So this was the thing I get feedback on. This is why I'm saying, you know, the entire medical nutritional obesity, diabetes, dogma is based on just a bad idea. You know, a failed paradigm and you know, who's going to accept that coming from a journalist. So the answer is either, you know, I'm an idiot or I'm self interested and I'm only making this up to get a paycheck or just wrong.

Speaker 1:          00:16:24       Do you feel vindicated? Or like when you see what's going on now where it's a pretty much common knowledge that sugar is terrible for you and that added sugar is a huge factor in diabetes and hypertension and heart disease and obesity and it's pretty much across the board now. Did you feel vindicated when you feel like,

Speaker 2:          00:16:45       here's the thing that the. Even though they're public health organizations that are now saying, you know, gotta cut back on the sugar and putting limits on sugar consumption. The logic is still that it's just empty calories. That's still the logic by who though they public health authorities, the researchers. Why?

Speaker 1:          00:17:04       Why do they lag so far behind? Because this is fascinating to me because I, I understand that there must be a guy like you who does what's kind of ridiculous and spending nine months on six weeks worth of pay and it does that kind of shit because otherwise once an idea is clearly established and gets repeated, like salt causes hypertension. I mean God damn it. If you ask the average person on the street, Hey, does salt causes high blood pressure? Oh yeah, they, they just say it because it's like sort of this peripheral idea. They hear it in the distance, they don't research it, they don't really look into it very far other than maybe they read something somewhere at one point in time and then they just decide it's dogma and they repeat it. It's so. It's incredibly difficult once an idea like that gets established in our society too to eradicate it. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       But again, this is the thing, it's sort of when you live in a community, in an institution where everybody believes exactly what you do and so the people you respect, I mean think about it, the people you respect are the people who think like you do, who agree with you on the important points because you think, oh, they're smart. They get it just like I get it. So institutions sort of collect group thing. It's just a natural emergent phenomenon from institutions and now if you look at the data, you're somebody like me and you come along and you say, I don't really buy this idea so that it's just empty calories. So I'm going to look at the data and see what it says, and now you try to convince your friends that they're wrong and now you're the heretic and you're the one who's saying, you know, you're getting in arguments with people and they make people uncomfortable because you're trying to get them to change their minds about thumps and they all believe and they've all been, you know, they're successful, they're promoted, they're leaders in their field because they believed this and now you're telling them that and people do it, but the, the, this just keeps going and going and going.

Speaker 2:          00:18:54       And even to the point, I mean, just when my sugar book came out, there was a book called the secret life of fat written by a phd and it's, it's as though everything I've done in the past 15 years just who's never done. Like somehow she managed to do an entire book on dietary fat where if anyone said to her, talk to Tobbs, even if he's wrong, his ideas are worth hearing because they're, they're provocative and interesting. I'm not so sure he's wrong. She decided not to do it. So it sort of do you have the two was her conclusion and effectively it's all, you know, again, it all comes back effectively to energy balance. You could talk about the two overconsumption. Um, it's just, this is what dogmas do. They just take, they, they reproduce themselves, they continue to grow there like tumors for that fact, and they, they, they basically fight off all challenges they absorb around them.

Speaker 2:          00:19:51       You know, so somebody starts saying it's something else. Eventually, ideally everything changes. So we're, we're definitely winning the sugar battle. So in sugar, even though that the official word is it's empty calories would just have to consume less because they have this dogma that obesity is caused by consuming too many calories. So the way that a food influences your body mass is through its caloric content or how much of those calories you digest and absorb. Because if it's got fiber, Yo excrete some and that's the, that's the wisdom of a calorie is a calorie than the worst you could say about sugar is that it's empty calories. It's got no vitamins and minerals, micronutrients attached. And so we consume too much of it and that people say it's the low hanging fruit, so it's not that it's uniquely toxic because of it's uniquely toxic if it actually causes disease and we can talk about clearly what I'm saying it causes than a calorie isn't a calorie. When you started doing this research and you started writing this book, the case against sugar w, W, when this was all unfolding in front of you, will you, will you shocked. I mean, is this something that you were where you were saying, how am I a guy who got a c plus c minus? I tried to pump you up.

Speaker 2:          00:21:09       I mean, how, how am I the guy who's figuring this out? How is this? Okay? So I understood why, but it is weird because again, I, you know, sometimes I was in Washington, my book tour and I had dinner with the former chief science medical science and medical officer with the American Diabetes Association. So very influential, high ranking successful man. He's completely convinced that I'm wrong. And I said, why you believe this thing that obesity is caused by eating too much and you have no idea why you believe it. So I can tell you exactly the history of that belief. Just like if we were talking about relativity, we can go back to Einstein and you would know about Einstein and even if we were talking quantum physics, we'd go back to Isenberg and trodden juror and bore and p and you'd know about them. But this belief that you're fundamentally arguing is right.

Speaker 2:          00:22:00       You don't understand where it comes from. And I can tell you that and I'm going to give you the documents. I'm going to give you the papers where it out competes, the hormonal metabolic idea, and I'm going to give you the competing hypothesis you didn't even know existed until you and I talked. You started reading my stuff and it has zero influence on how this guy thinks. He's just. He's so convinced these. Right? So that's terrifying. That's terrifying. When someone has that kind of influence over the American people. Well, and this is a thing you want somebody who does at least say Jesus, you know, I never thought of that. Let me at least have them. Let me read these and get back to you is what you want them to do. You want to. The problem of course is that if he agrees to this and then he agrees that you're correct, everything that he's been saying up until now has been bullshit and he's been misleading people.

Speaker 2:          00:22:44       He has to apologize history as well. And then once you do that, you lose your credit. Like ideally and science here, you know, the best scientists, the ones who say, you know, I was just wrong, right? And then, but how they were actually when I was growing up, the estimate was five percent of the scientific community actually does good science and the other 95 percent are sort of the chaff out of which you got to get the wheat. But um, yeah, I mean it's a problem. I used to joke, imagine the American Heart Association writing the press release to say like, we were wrong about putting everybody on a low fat diet. And it was a mistake and we're sorry, and we apologize and maybe we killed some of your relatives prematurely. Maybe the reason you're fat and diabetic now is because of our advice, but we got to right now, they won't do it.

Speaker 2:          00:23:32       He can't do it. That's public health wreck. It's just they can't do it. It's an untenable. I mean, I'll say the same thing if I'm wrong in my book. I used to have this argument with my cofounder of this nutrition science initiative, this not for profit. And I'd say you don't understand if I'm wrong and the major arguments in this book, I mean clearly I'm going to be wrong. And some of the minor ones and you know, chip away here and there are bad scholarship that I should have tripled checked. But if I'm wrong in the major arguments, I need a new line of work because I can trust my judgment. And everything I do as an investigative journalist is dependent on me being able to trust my judgment. And if I'm wrong about this, like if I'm wrong about energy balance, I got to go sell shoes. You know, there's no way around it, but this is.

Speaker 1:          00:24:22       I lost track. What were we saying? What was the question? I talked too much. Well, I was asking you first of all, what is it like to have this understanding that all of what's being told to the American people is wrong and then you having this conversation. So how do I, how do I do it? How do I do? Am I getting

Speaker 2:          00:24:42       this? So let me tell you why I was able to do what. And again, I was the first person who ever did. It's just that simple. No one had ever done before, but it was timing. First of all, I'm an obsessive research or is 145 people I interviewed for the fat story for one magazine Article. I just keep asking questions and probing and probing until every ism like writing. So it's a great research. It's a procrastination tool, but when I started this in 2002, when I got the money to do the book, the Internet had come along and the Internet made it possible to find every single primary source. Going back to the 19th century, like now, you could almost download them, but back then I had researchers, young students in in Boston, New York, La, whose only job was. They'd get an email from me with 50 citations and then they'd go to the library and have to find every, all 50 in xerox them and then ship them back to me sometimes entire books from like, you know, 19, 17 diabetes textbook that I couldn't find or I couldn't buy and bookstores had put their used bookstores, put their catalogs online so you could find all the books and you know, some 19, 47 obesity conference.

Speaker 2:          00:25:59       The library that has it doesn't see any purpose for that anymore. So they basically give it to the local bookstore and you can buy it for seven bucks. So I was able to recreate the history of obesity research from conference proceedings were the only people doing research in the field would show up and they would present their findings and then they would do a proceedings of the findings and I could recreate all the thinking in the field and nobody had ever bothered to do it before and it's kind of if they were good scientists, they would have because they would have been obsessed with where their beliefs came from and they would have been questioning them and one of the things they would have done is gone back to do all this to see if some assumption they believe is true is really based on fact.

Speaker 2:          00:26:43       But again, they didn't really know what science was. They weren't all that curious is one way to put it. That's so terrifying. It is. It's so terrifying. When you know you, you think of what people. Most people are busy. They work all day. They have families, they have jobs, they have obligations. They don't have the time to do the research that you did about diet and come to these shocking conclusions themselves. It's not going to happen, but then they rely on the people like this guy from the diabetes association that's supposed to be telling you the truth and looking at the truth and he doesn't want to do it because it makes them look like an asshole. Well, and you will also rely on, I mean these are so they read the review articles and the reviewers and the editors of the journals want to get influential review articles, so they ask influential people in the field to do the review articles and those people are very busy, but they're going to do with and they're gonna.

Speaker 2:          00:27:36       Basically. They became influential by believing the conventional wisdom and propagating the conventional wisdom. When you have committees do investigations, so every five years you get the dietary, the Usta puts together a committee to reassess the dietary guidelines that they give out. So the way the committees are formed, they usta picks a very influential person. The most influential. They get to be the head of the committee and that's somebody who's believed the conventional wisdom and propagate it their whole life. That's how they became influential and then person picks people they respect to be on the committee and of course the people they respect, the people believe what they believe because they're the ones who seem smart. They're not the heretics, they're the believers. So you end up with a. You start out just with a natural quest. We want to know if the guidelines are correct and through this completely natural human process, you end up staffing the guy creating a committee that's going to recapitulate the conventional wisdom almost 100 percent and it's just the way things happen.

Speaker 2:          00:28:36       So you need people like me to come across every once in a while, assuming I can write better when the people like me are right. Then when they're wrong, but you're going to get both types and we got to come along. We have to have the persistence, you know, that basically just keep doing what we do. I was lucky that I also had this podium, the New York Times magazine editors trusted me and liked my work. The science editors trusted me and thought I would be really good so I could get an influential publications. I didn't have to, you know, published to a blog and try to win people over.

Speaker 2:          00:29:12       But from their perspective, I mean it's just what do you do with someone like me? And I argued, look, I've done this research. You haven't. I mean, another way to think about it, I went, I said, look, you know, we've got these obesity and diabetes epidemics worldwide. I mean, there should be horrifying to people. Okay. I'm in fairly recent. Well, in terms of human history, in terms of human history, so one of the game, one of the things I did in the case against sugar is I went back to find the very beginnings of the epidemic in the United States because if you got an epidemic, like if we had the Zika epidemic, Ebola, what do you do? You're going to try to figure out what's causing a bola by looking at the patients who are getting off the airplane and Houston are showing up in the hospital in New Jersey.

Speaker 2:          00:29:55       You go back to Africa where it's densest and where it started and you could follow it to whatever animal got bit by whatever insect and whatever cave and that's a natural process of understanding an epidemic. So I go back here and you can go back to the, the 19th century and there are hospitals in the United States, the date to pre 18, 50 or 18, 64 in the case of Philadelphia Hospital in Pennsylvania. And that their records anyway, go there and you can ask the archivist to go back. They still have their case records from the 19th century and you can have the archivist pull up the case records and they will tell you how many cases of diabetes were diagnosed in the hospitals. And you know, any year from like in mass general hospital in Boston. The record starting in 18, 24, um, today, one in 11 American diabetic.

Speaker 2:          00:30:50       Okay. And there are some populations like native American populations where one in two adults are diabetic. Jesus Christ in Boston, mass general hospital, that leading hospital in the country and the, in Massachusetts in the 19th century. There were year after year after year were hit, they had zero cases of diabetes and this was a terrible disease. Without insulin, it's not a pleasure with it, but before insulin was discovered, I mean you go blind, kidney failure, gangrene, amputation. So it's not a difficult diagnosis. Now there are the reasons to explain the absence. I mean, you know, the only people showed up in hospitals back in the 19th century were poor people and poor people eat a lot less sugar than rich people. Wow. So enrich people got their own private doctor so they might not have shown up in the diabetes in the medical record. So you can, you got to always be skeptical of what you think you're learning because that's what science is.

Speaker 2:          00:31:45       But you know, the point I'm making is I went through the effort to do this one way or the other and that gives me a certain advantage that they don't have. And if they're good scientists, regardless of what they believe, they'll say to themselves, Geez, you know, I never thought of this. I never did that. I can think of these tabs is wrong, but maybe I should look into it. And where did it all start? So in the u s it starts again in the second half of the 18 19th century and it starts coincidentally with an explosion and sugar consumption, not just in how much sugar we're consuming, but who's consuming it, which is what's fascinating and scary. So prior go back, say 200 years, you know, 18, 10, 18, 15, we were probably getting about five pounds of sugar per capita in the United States.

Speaker 2:          00:32:35       So that's about five pounds over a period of a year per person per year. So that's the equivalent of, about the sugar, a one Coca Cola, 12 ounce cokes worth of sugar every six days. And it was the head of the hilarious. It's not like it's frightening because it's expensive back then, right? The attitude back then, um, you know, they would, they would, well they desert courses hadn't really been invented yet. Really know. I mean, again, the wealthy would have dessert, so the wealthy and the wealthy are the ones who would get diabetes and obesity and gout back then. Um, so sugar has this curve where it goes from being very rare and just sort of the luxury of royalty to the wealthy are using it. And then finally with the beginning of the industrial revolution and a late 18th century, and then refining processes or improved and sugar starts to get cheaper.

Speaker 2:          00:33:35       And then during the Napoleonic wars, like 18, 12, when France has cut from the, from their sugar supply, by the English blockades, Napoleon says, look, we got to figure out how to create our own sugar in this clever Frenchmen and figures out how to get sugar from sugar beets. And the beet sugar industry takes off around 1850. Um, and then with the beet sugar and street and sugar in the northern hemisphere and the temperate climates, and you could also grow sugar cane and it's only in tropical climates. So now sugar prices started to plummet. Meanwhile, you think about all the ways we consume sugar today. So candy, soft drinks, ice cream, chocolate. The low fat desserts, low fat milk, low fat yogurt. None of that existed until 1840. So 1840. Is He the start of the candy industry? They started the chocolate industry, the lint brothers and Switzerland figure out how to make chocolate bars.

Speaker 2:          00:34:32       They're still, you can still buy Lindt chocolate today and it's pretty good actually. Um, ice cream industry starts in the 1840 [inaudible] soft drinks starting the 18 seventies with Dr Pepper than Coca Cola than Pepsico. Dr Pepper was first Dr. Pepper was first. Oh, weird. Yeah, that's like an afterthought. Yeah. Yeah, I know. Well, I didn't have the marketing budgets of the Coca Cola people. Um, so sugar starts becoming like women are targeted as cold as you know, because it's now cheap enough. So the men get their alcohol and their cigarettes and the women get sugar and the kids get sugar. So the first time in history, suddenly we have all these industries created to basically target children as customers. If you think about it, nobody's drinking cold drinks at home. So refrigeration, refrigeration until the 19 thirties and no vending machines until the 19 thirties. I love this because I'm a science guy, but in doing my books, you have to become a historian and you just don't think about this stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:35:36       So with the vending machines and the refrigerators, suddenly Coca Cola and Pepsico and these start targeting, you know, you start getting a six packs and the cartons, cases of sodas and big bottles of soda that you could take home, put in your refrigerator and drink all day long, couldn't do it before that, couldn't get ice cubes easily before that you couldn't even, you know, quote down in the summer, um, fruit juices come in in the 19 thirties, a California orange growers. That's a big one, right? Because that's one of the people think is totally innocuous and actually healthy. Yeah, because it's got all that vitamin C, which is explaining to people right now that if you're drinking a big glass of orange juice, you might as well be drinking a pepsi effectively. That's what I believe. So those are the two b. You got these complete putting nutritional paradigms.

Speaker 2:          00:36:25       One says if it's got vitamins and minerals in a telephone, it's a pepsi with vitamins and minerals. It's a pepsi with vitamins and minerals, take a vitamin pill and then drink a pepsi and it's the same goddamn effectively. Yeah, it's so crazy to me. I always thought like, what's fresh squeezed? It's got Paul Pinot. Well, this is when. So the California Orange Growers Forum sunkist that was a consortium of California. They had all these extra oranges, they couldn't sell at oranges are all come and you coming along in one season. So back then without refrigeration and cars, he could keep fruits kind of alive for like a year. By freezing them, you know, you had all these extra oranges you couldn't sell. So they said let's get people to turn into orange juice and we'll advertise at the vitamin C is good for the new nutrition of the 19 twenties in 1930.

Speaker 2:          00:37:11       It was all about vitamin deficiency diseases and so scurvy is caused by the absence of vitamin C and Barry Barry by vitamin B and that, that was the big news. So the orange growers started pushing orange juice sawdust because it with vitamin C content. So now we're drinking fruit juices for breakfast everyday and then post World War Two concentrates are created. That was actually a defense, you know, World War II program to try and figure out how to create foods that soldiers could take into battle and get their vitamins from it. So that comes along. And then the last one is sugary cereals. So the scenario in the street was created by um, compost and Kellogg who are health nuts. They ran sanatoriums and Minnesota, right? And they knew their health nutritionist didn't want to put sugar in anything. They had some huge fights over this. Um, but 19, 48 post release sugar crisps some.

Speaker 2:          00:38:08       And it's, you know, 30 percent sugar by calories or something. That's the first sugar coated cereal. And for the next decade you can watch the cereal industries have these internal battles where the marketing people are saying, we need a sugar sweetened cereal. We've got to compete. We're going to be run out of the business. And the health people are saying, no, no sugar is bad for you. And in every case, the marketers one by the 19 sixties, not only do you have like all these, some of these scenarios were 50 percent sugar by calories, still are, but you've got all these iconic TV shows that were created just to sell sugar cereals too. I mean rocky and bullwinkle, which is my favorite. This was heartbreaking. I mean those guys were created to sell cereal to the women, the comic, the comic, the TV show that was created as a vehicle to market.

Speaker 2:          00:38:56       I forget which cereal it was which company, but all of these things, you know, I mean there were, the cartoon was an afterthought. The cartoon was a method to sell. So the, the cereal industry would hire, you know, these brilliant public relations men who would create these characters and then get Hollywood to create animated tv shows with these characters. And then they would always sell the same sugar sweetened cereals. Wow. And so now we're just, you know, think what happened to kids. Okay. So the obese and diabetic people in the world are the ones who started. We all started as children, right? So you know, 18, oh five, 18, 10, updating 50, maybe they see sugar once a week, you know, they still went to the country store and when Uncle Ed is turned the wrong way, they stick their hand in the sugar barrow and lick their fingers and alc by 1960.

Speaker 2:          00:39:53       It's like orange juice cereal, you know, sugary cereal, sugar on the sugary cereal for breakfast, you know, a coke for a snack and candy bar. The same kind of foods for lunch. I mean, I bet most Americans didn't go more than three hours without a sugar dose, whereas 150 years earlier they'd had gone a week between doses. And as this happens, you see these explosions and obesity and diabetes that they're slow to build and I think I could eat that can be explained to by the fact that mothers pass this on to their kids when the kids are in the wound. Is there a difference in how much of a difference is there, if any between, um, diet, dietary diabetes or diet diabetes is directly attributed to diet and genetic? Well, again, there are different. First of all, there are different types, type one diabetes type one type one is the acute form that hits mostly in childhood, um, and has a strong genetic component.

Speaker 2:          00:40:52       It's an auto immune disease, but that doesn't mean it's not fundamentally caused by sugar. And by that I mean if we didn't never get around to eating sugar, we wouldn't have type one diabetes and that really woke people that think that type one diabetes, which is something that um, people I know have and well, it's just genetic. It's just something you were born with. That's not necessarily true. Oh, they couldn't be born with it. I mean, it could be an, it could be genetic, but it still has to be triggered, could be triggered by something in the environment. So these people with type one diabetes didn't have a poor diet, didn't consume sugar, didn't eat the average American diet would never itself their mothers. Maybe even more importantly in the womb, in the womb. Yeah, Christ. The third to last chapter of my book, the lead to, of the last three chapters before the epilogue is called are called the if then problems.

Speaker 2:          00:41:50       So let me lay out what I'm proposing here. The case against sugar. Here's the. So the. There's a crime, I think of it as a, you know, we're in a courtroom, a courtroom and there's a crime that's committed. The crime is epidemics of obesity and diabetes that happened whenever a population transitions from their traditional diet to a western diet and lifestyle. So it doesn't matter what the population is, it can be the inuits living on like Caribou and cme. They could be Mussai living on the blood, milk, meat from the cattle they heard. That could be agrarian populations, that could be south Pacific islanders living on coconuts. And you know, pigs. I'm aborigines in Australia, Middle Eastern populations, African populations, European populations. It does not matter. Eventually they transition. You see these epidemics of recent diabetes, that's the crime. So the argument I'm making is that sugar is always at the scene of the crime in a population wide level.

Speaker 2:          00:42:48       So there's a lot of things that happen when you transitioned to western diets. For instance, a lot of populations eat more meat, but some populations like the inuits, they don't eat more me because they reading or the native Americans of the plains Indians, they don't eat more meat because they were living on me to begin with, but they also get obesity and diabetes epidemics. I'm willing to rule out meat on that level and other people did as well. You know, they become more sedentary when you're Westernized. You get more labor saving devices, you dry places instead of walking places. So maybe it's sedentary behavior, but you could find populations that are incredibly physically active. Um, cane cut it there a in the natal region of South Africa in the 18th century, they used to import a in the Indians from India as indentured slaves, indentured laborers effectively slavery, but they call them indentured laborers to work in the sugar plantations and a cane cutters in the sugar plantations.

Speaker 2:          00:43:48       That was one of the most energy intense jobs you can imagine than one estimate was they burned 9,000 calories a day. And yet, these in the town Indians had among the highest rates of diabetes ever seen and their ancestors, the population from which they were drawn in India, had virtually no diabetes and the primary difference in their diet was a sugar consumption. So you could play this game where you isolate out populations and what you find. What I found, this is no population when you get an obesity and diabetes epidemic, where sugar recent increases in sugar consumption habit occurred and by recent it could be 20 years ago, could be 50 years ago. So it's always at the scene of the crime. Now, type two diabetes, the common form that associates with excess weight is a, um, uh, it's fundamentally the sort of what's called insulin resistance.

Speaker 2:          00:44:40       So type one, you, your pancreas doesn't secrete enough insulin. Type two, your body is resistant to the insulin that your pancreas secretes. So you gotTa pump, you've got to secrete more and more to keep your blood sugar under control. And the idea is eventually your pancreas gets exhausted and the can't do it anymore. And then you have a deficit of insulin and it looks like you're. The results were pretty much similar to type one. So insulin resistance is also very closely associated to obesity. And we could discuss that as well. Um, you could look at these epidemics of obesity, diabetes, heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer's, dementia basically is manifestations of insulin resistance happening all around the world in different ways and different people, but they're all related to insulin resistance and insulin. And then you ask yourself, well causes the insulin resistance. So the best researchers in the world who study insulin resistance, the leading hypothesis is that it starts in the liver and it starts in the liver with the conversion, with the accumulation of fats and liver cells.

Speaker 2:          00:45:49       And in fact, we also have an epidemic of what's called nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in this country right now used to be 20 slash 30 years ago, if I'm. If you've got fatty liver disease and you saw your doctor and you told them you didn't drink, they would just assume you're lying because they clearly. Alcoholics got fatty liver disease. But suddenly people started showing up who swore they didn't drink, and then kids started showing up with fatty liver disease who clearly didn't drink alcohol. So we got this concept nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. It's basically indistinguishable from the alcoholic kind and it's happened. The CDC estimates 40 million Americans have this, and if it progresses, it can progress to what's called Nash, which is not alcoholics stereo hepatitis, and eventually the need for liver transplant. So Sugar Christ. Now I know like what are we talking about when we're talking about sugar? So sugar cane sugar beet sugar are technically sucrose. That's a molecule of glucose bonded to a molecule. Fructose, fructose makes it sweet.

Speaker 2:          00:47:01       High Fructose Corn Syrup is 45 percent glucose, 55 percent fructose, same chemical constituents. They're not bonded together. I don't think that makes a damn bit of difference. Some people do. Um, the fructose is metabolized in your liver, so the glucose gets into your bloodstream, just like any other glucose from any other carbohydrate. The fructose goes to your liver and your liver gets it in a high dose, like say from an apple juice or something. It has trouble dealing with that much fructose. You never evolved to see a glass of apple juice for glass can of cokes worth of fructose be delivered over the course of five, 10 minutes, probably even 30 minutes, so it converted into fat. So we have a condition, insulin resistant that's epidemic worldwide that you know, the leading research in the country think is caused by the accumulation of fat in liver cells and we've got a substance sugar that's been exploded in use worldwide in which half of it is metabolized in the liver and it's converted into fat and liver cells. So it's like it's at the scene of the crime in populations and set the scene of the crime in a body and it's got a mechanism. It's got the gun necessary. You know, you can match the bullets almost, but we don't have the smoking gun. That's where the research falls short. And then, so this is the case I'm making. Then if sugar causes insulin resistance, there are all kinds of downstream effects including what mothers will do to their children if they are insulin resistant and have high blood sugar when they're pregnant.

Speaker 2:          00:48:45       Jesus Christ. Yeah. Well, and that's why my argument is, you know, it's almost too much. It would be easier if I just said it's empty calories because you know what, what back against your book and against your research, have you experienced. Well, I mean, there are people who just object to my exists. Have you debated these people? Uh, I'm in the process of debating to have them online now. The keto in Keto, one bound, it's called. I went to, by the way, done this. If I'm, I'm not a fan of debates in science because I don't think they settled thing. I'm a fans of people getting together and saying, look, you believe this, I believe this. What experiment can we do to find out who's not, who's the better rider? You know, read a rhetorician I know what you're saying. Yeah. He was more charismatic point across more, you know, it's just that pallet in the obesity society.

Speaker 2:          00:49:36       And the, uh, Jordan, the nutrition society's once a year they'll have their annual conference alva debate over this and everybody, Oh yeah, I thought you did better, but nobody walks out of the debate saying, what experiment can we do to settle this? And I think it's, you don't get me to have these epidemics are tragic. The cost of obesity and diabetes in the US direct cost, the medical systems estimate is $2,000,000,000 a year. I mean, excuse me, a billion dollars a day. What light direct cost to the healthcare system. Three hundred $65 million dollars a year just because of obesity and diabetes. Jesus. And if you think about it, so that's $365,000,000,000. It is a direct cost to the tax burden on the healthcare system, but it's a tremendous for the pharmaceutical industry, right? In the physicians and the hospitals that are getting that money. So they don't have quite much motivation

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       as might to stem this tide because they're profiting

Speaker 1:          00:50:32       from it. Are they even aware of the causes of it? If your, if your work is so controversial and there's so many people out there that are disputing it or disputing this link between sugar and all these horrible diseases and they're calling it empty calories, is this even something that in the medical community where they spend a ridiculously short amount of time in school learning about nutrition and. Well, thank God for that because if they learn more, they would learn the wrong thing. Right? Then they'd be dogmatic point now. Well these people, they don't really have the information. You know, you can go ahead and blow your nose, man. Don't worry about it. You've been struggling with it for awhile. He had gary sick because he hasn't had enough sugar, ladies and gentlemen. Yes, exactly. Um, but I mean, it seems to me like they don't have the time. I mean, I don't have the time to do the research that you did. A very few people do. It really takes someone like you. It takes a maniac to go out there and, and stretch your finances and put yourself in a bad position to and really be obsessive chasing this down. Yeah, no, it's true.

Speaker 3:          00:51:35       Again, that doesn't mean that you're supposed to believe somebody like me. And again, you can, you know, I'm a journalist. I used to think, you know, imagined some plumber came up to me one day and he said, you know, I just spent like the last 10 years of my life studying how to do termism and I've written this book and you're doing it all wrong. That's a good point. You know, and I'm like, okay, yeah, sure, I'll take the book, you know, and I can't wait to read it. Then I'm going to go home and I'm not probably going to throw the book out because the odds that that's a waste of time for me are enormous.

Speaker 1:          00:52:12       When one was the first one, when did diabetes first sort of emerge in, in medical records? Medical records, you said

Speaker 3:          00:52:23       2000 years ago when, like Hindu medical documents, uh, coincidentally with the beginning of the sugar industry in northern India. Yeah, I mean just give or take 200 years. Holy Shit. But, um, and even back then they speculate that it was caused by sugar. Although I think for the wrong reasons, because the diabetic urine and you're pissing out a lot of glucose, right, because your body can't handle it, so it's Sweden, it'll attract flies and back then even up until a 17th century, part of classic medical practice was for the physician to have his assistant taste the urine. He didn't. He didn't have to do it himself, but the. And that could be, by the way, one reason why a lot of diabetes went undiagnosed. People wouldn't drink the as people wouldn't drink the pis. Yeah. So, and you got to keep all this stuff in mind. I mean this is a ridiculous way. All they had, you know, science is determined by the technology available. That was one of the lessons that we can get into this because all my books are about good science and bad science that I. I hope I understand what I'm doing. Like I said, I

Speaker 4:          00:53:26       know if I don't, it's really bad. It's embarrassing. Yeah. I wake up at three, four in the morning and thinking, why do I so obsessed about this calorie issue? Nobody else seems to care, but people do now, don't, don't you feel that we live in a very small world. You know, it's hard to understand. I mean even with your whatever, 20 million downloads a month that all your followers is not more than that. Yeah. I mean think about how many of those voted for the current president for instance. I mean it's just, it's a very. I'm glad to hear it's a lot more because I want to get this out, you know, I mean even if it's just for this one particular subject, which I think is probably the most important subject today when in terms of health and wellness and just optimizing your existence, cutting out sugar and changing your diet I think is one of the most important factors and living a healthier, more productive life and also mental clarity.

Speaker 4:          00:54:21       Well now let me ask you a question. When you cut out sugar, so you said you cut it out slowly. What were you eating at the time? Because I gather I'd never ate bad. The but I pastas and bread I eat. I always supplemented with vitamins. I always worked out hard and I was always lean because I worked out so much, so I never thought I had an issue with fat or I never thought I had an issue with any of those things, but I would get that crash. I would did that in late afternoon crash and this fucking insulin dump. Yeah, I used to say, I say I don't take naps. They take me like an hour after lunch and I'd be interviewing some Nobel prize. What I'd have to think of an excuse to get off because I was falling asleep. Do you mean that doesn't happen to me anymore?

Speaker 4:          00:55:05       No, it's fascinating. It's unbelievably fascinating. I would never have guessed. I would've thought you needed some sort of stimulant to keep you going like that. Although in all honesty, we were both drinking bulletproof coffees right now, so we are getting some sort of stimulant. We are, but I didn't. I didn't have to have that. I mean, but that's the book tour. Yeah, but here's the thing, when you cut out the grains, the bread, the pasta, that's still. That's glucose. So were you eating sugar? We're drinking gatorade very rarely, very rarely. I was still eating pretty clean, like I would have dessert every now and then, but it wasn't more than a few times a week. I wasn't eating candy bars during the day, but I was eating the occasional protein bar that was loaded with sugar that I didn't even think it was. So that's what I thought it was.

Speaker 4:          00:55:47       Eating healthy. That's what gets me. So once we got into this diet, to this idea. So one of the things, and this was a second article I read, so is there evidence to support this idea we should be eating the low fat diet? I mean the second article I wrote and I recreated the history of that and it was fascinating because once these people got this idea that fat caused heart disease. So remember, science is determined by what you can measure. So the technology have tells you what you can measure and what you can measure, what you can ask questions about, and then that gives you the answers and if you're bad scientists forget that. It's completely limited to the technology. So there's an old joke in science

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       called the drunk and the streetlight problem, do you ever hear about now? So guys walking down the street and he comes upon a drawn coups crawling around in his knees under a street light and he says to the guy, what are you doing? And the guy says, I'm looking for my keys. And the guy said, so cisco, you lost them in the drunk goes, I don't know where I lost them, but this is where the light is. Okay. So in science it's like what you could measure is where the light is and you got to remember that there's a universe out there that you can't see yet because. But most scientists, most scientists don't realize that they're just not good scientists. So in the heart disease, the light was on cholesterol. That was at 1950 sixties. That's what they could measure. And they got this idea that it's caused by dietary fat.

Speaker 3:          00:57:07       And because of that we just, you know, again, they tested and tested this hypothesis and kept being failed the test, but they didn't care because they thought it had to be true. And by the 19 eighties we lock it in as a dogma and now we have this idea that the healthy way to eat is a low fat diet and you start making products where you take the fat out of it and once you take the fat out of something, it doesn't taste all that good. Like yogurts, a classic example, I mean it is fat and some modest amount of black posts. I don't even know if there's lactose in it and I should know this stuff because then people say clearly you're not a nutritionist, so they candy bars instead of eating snickers bars, which a high fat, high sugar thing that we grew up on.

Speaker 3:          00:57:54       You create clif bars and nature's way bars and all these low fat health food bars that we think are healthy because they're low in fat. They're loaded with carbs and they fill them up with sugar. And then to this day I'm wondering like, should I just let you know, we have a drawer with these health food bars at my wife. I'm not the only parent in the family. So my kids are in tortured by my food beliefs. Um, would they be healthier if they just ate snickers bars like we did when we were kids? And I don't know what the answer is. I literally, I could argue it either way. How could you argue it? That they would be healthier if they had all that sugar? Well, they both have the sugar. Will you both like Lara bars versus those Lara bars? I really love those.

Speaker 3:          00:58:37       They taste good, but they're 19 fucking grams of sugar or something crazy. And it's only like the size of your thumb. Yeah. So the basically, I don't know what the sugar content that you can probably google it while we're talking about regular size snickers bar. It's probably more than 19 grams, but it's also got all that fat in it, which will slow down the digestion of the sugar. So a snickers bar arguably is better for you than some of these really super sugary, what we think air quotes are healthy snacks like trail bars and. Yeah, and the key word there is arguably it. Here we go, 20 grams of sugar. And what does that. A snickers bar. That's a lot. Yes. Christ. Yeah. But it's a bigger. It's going to be a big way more. So what about the law of in a way more. Well, it's a 44 grams. Okay. Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:59:24       Yeah. Those things. Lara bars. St. Find out what, what the fuck is in those bad boys? Because I had one. I bought one once. This is before I had gone on my crusade sugar. It says wait a minute. But they're fruit and nut bars. So the question is how much sugar are in the fruit? Maybe you're looking at the. Maybe it's a different one. Which one are you looking at here? Yeah, that's it. What does it say here? How many grams? Twenty grams. Twenty grams. So it's the same as this. So why the fuck are they lying? No added sugar. It could be because it comes from fruit sugar. Your body doesn't know that you're playing a Goddamn game. Yes. You're playing a game. Exactly. Let's say. I'm just curious how fruits and nuts in their bars. World Health Organization's recommended daily sugar intake for adults. Five percent of daily caloric intake for normal weight adult eating 2000 calories a day.

Speaker 4:          01:00:15       That's 25 grams. So now is that added sugar per day? I mean when you're talking about lactose, when you talk to me about fruits, it's funny, I just, a friend just sent me an article today on a European Journal of clinical nutrition where they were looking at sugar content of children's diets in Europe and they age one, they were 30 percent of their calories from sugar Jesus Christ, but just trying to make sense of it. I pretty sure that included lactose free milk, which was a primary source. He said the primary source of the sugar with dairy products. It could also be from, you know, a Bot artificial formulas. People take that in consideration, right? If you two pieces of cheese, you're getting some sugar. Yeah. Although again, cheese once you process it, process and lose the lactose. Um, but yeah, it sort of. But even the lactose is metabolized differently than the fructose.

Speaker 4:          01:01:11       So I would argue that we evolved to consume lactose at least until we were out in weaning. Few, three, four years old. Drank milk, no, I actually gave up their right, but for different reasons, not because I uh, for me it has unfortunate gastrointestinal side effects that my whole family could live without, um, you know, uh, if you go into a low carb, high fat diet, which I think is a help, certainly those of us should be eating or predisposed to get fat or diabetic. Um, yeah. Cheese is a very valuable item with the Diet and clearly like the French and the Swiss and even the Greeks had enormous amounts of cheese and they live quite a long time there. Do you believe in raw milk? Have you attempted to try that? Or raw cheese? I don't. Is My gut feeling from him or I'm a, I'm a, I focus obsessively on one subject and it's the carb content and the sugars and the refined grains and the.

Speaker 4:          01:02:11       What's the cause of obesity? I don't. Raw milk doesn't enter into that discussion. And what Amanda about it is just from the gastrointestinal issues, because a lot of people believe that raw milk with all the natural enzymes in it is easier for your body to process. That's quite possible, but again, as a, if you're way weight easily, then I wouldn't be recommending liquid carbs of any kind, including the lactose. And so, um, they look at the low carb diets traditionally and historically they never allowed for milk even. I mean, you might go for a heavy cream or cream, you know, that sort of Atkins thing or the bulletproof coffee thing. But yeah, I know a lot of people who are on the key to genic diet that will actually drink heavy cream. Yeah. My friend Kyle, who actually was one of the first people that turned me onto at Kingsbury, he, uh, he, he carries around this little fucking pint of heavy cream, but he's a savage.

Speaker 4:          01:03:08       Yeah, no, my uh, former collaborator Peter Attia who's his, you know, Internet handle. One point I think was kidogenic man and he used to drink olive oil cheeses, cream a well because you've got to really up the fat those diets for a lot of people to get Cathartic. Not everyone, but um, it's interesting. I thought I heard you were trying it. I'm on it. Yeah. And what essentially. So tell me your diet. Well, um, a lot of Avocados, a lot of coconut oil. I'm, I might eat a little bit more protein than I'm supposed to, which unfortunately does convert back to sugar in your body of glucose, but easily much more easily processed obviously than high fructose corn syrup. Right. I'm very, very little pastas or grains or breads or anything. It's a rare thing that I eat that stuff. Do you actually measure your ketones?

Speaker 4:          01:04:00       I've done it before, but I have a problem with those things. Those, the Jab, your finger. It's too hard for me to get blood out. I do a lot of Kettlebell stuff, houses on my fingers and my hands, so I have to actually go into the side of my hand to get the blood I have to go like above the fingerprints to the upper skin area and squeeze out the blood. It's fucking annoying. So I know when I'm in it. And also I take um, ketogenic supplements. I'll take like a exoticness ketones. Like there's this stuff called regenix. Is there anything that tastes decent? Yeah. Key genex tastes really good, tastes good. It's a good drink. It's a, it's made by Dom D'agostino is one of the premier research scientists that's devoted to a ketogenic diet and I heard about him from Tim Ferriss, his podcast, and I've read some of his work online and listened to some of his lectures and talks and um, I find it a, first of all, as far as like appetite suppressing. It's fantastic once your body starts burning fat, you don't get that weird hunger thing. Was it? Yeah. That's the thing because you're not just mobilizing your fat, burning it, it's all coming out. It's not being your bodies and trying to hold onto it. You're not freaking out. That's the thing. It's like when I was on a heavy carb diet, because I love pasta. Got It. Love like Lasagna and linguine with clams

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       and it's just like. I just love it. It's fantastic and occasionally on indulge as a rare treat now, but when I was eating it all the time, I would have this two or three hour post eating thing where that stuff would be gone. It would all be digested and then I'd be fucking starving in the next hour or so. I remember the old joke about, you know Chinese like two hours later, you're starving. Yeah, I mean that's really what it is. Your body starts craving those carbohydrates as simple car

Speaker 3:          01:05:45       because you're. You're. You're burning the sugar so you. The carbs are converted to glucose. You're burning the glucose, you're secreting insulin, and the insulin is telling you fat to hold onto fat. This is my theory anyway, and it's backed up by the evidence, so as the blood sugar starts coming down, your fat tissue is supposed to release the fat and allow to come out and be oxidized by the same cells and the Mitochondria in your cells and this famous krebs cycle that we're all supposed to learn in like 11th grade biology and could never remember. The Krebs cycle is just as happy to burn fat as Carbs, but if the insulin's high, it's telling your Mitochondria to burn carbs, not fat, and it's telling the fat cells to hold onto fat and now you've just got a dearth of fuel. It's actually telling your lean tissue to hold onto protein, so now your blood sugar's coming down, but the insulin still elevated and there's no fuels replacing the blood sugar and now you bonk, you bonk or you start to panic or you know, and this is why you know, I mean, once we instituted this low fat thing and people said, well, Americans get fat because they snack all the time.

Speaker 3:          01:06:55       They're constantly grazing where they're constantly grazing because their cells are running out of fuel. No matter how much they're eating for breakfast of their low fat stuff, if they're insulin is elevated, their cells are gonna, wanna burn carbs. And this is one of the observations you found in the literature in the 1830 [inaudible]. There was a Hungarian endocrinologist working at northwestern university. You talked about some of his obese pay. He said he had a patient who was an obese Alondra's fused to eat laundry starch. Oh Jesus Christ. But that's what the fuck is. Laundry starch starch. It's a carbohydrate, man. I didn't. I had no idea. But the point is, if your insulin is elevated, carbohydrates are your fuel. It's singling your cells to burn glucose and not to burn fat and not the burn protein, so carbs are your fuel there young. That's what you need, so when you start to get hungry, you crave that because that's the only thing your cells are going to burn.

Speaker 3:          01:07:52       So then if you do like you try a get agentic diet or low carb, high fat diet, whatever you wanna call it and you get rid of the carbs and you get an effect, your insulin comes down. Then you get this natural thing where you eat your store. Some of the fat, you're burning fat. When you're done burning the fat in your bloodstream, the fat comes out of yourselves. There's just nice cycle that's supposed to happen. You always have enough fuel available that you know you're not hungry. That's one of the common phenomenon. It's the idea that suddenly I have breakfast. The next thing I know it's two, three in the afternoon and I'm thinking maybe I should eat lunch just because I should eat lunch because I'm hungry. Knox, I'm starving. You know, and they need lunch. He'll fall asleep afterwards because your body has a fuel supply because your body has a concept fullest by yourselves or being fueled whether you're reading or not. You got an a fat in your body to live for like a month even if you're relatively leave.

Speaker 1:          01:08:44       No, I should point out that some high level athletes are having an issue with this. Some people that are used to burning off massive amounts cowers during the day, like mixed martial artists and things along those lines. Some of them adapt to it fine and I haven't had a great time with it and find it easier to make weight and easier to train, but other ones say that they have just a lack of that extra gear and training. Now. I don't know if they're doing it fully disciplined, like if they're monitoring their ketones. If they're really sure about their diet, they've got it 75 slash 25.

Speaker 3:          01:09:15       Some of the earliest studies ever done on this was by a guy named Steve Finney, who's co author of two books, the art and science of low carb living in the art and science of low carb performance and Steve Back in the late seventies, early eighties. He was at the, I think it's Vermont, where there was a team of people studying doing some interesting diet experiments and he put professional bike racers and ketogenic diets and measured their performance versus their sort of traditional high carb diets and he keto adapted them so they were fully adapted to burning fat for fuel and from his studies basically he said that they're more efficient until they have to push that last sort of five percent out like up a mountain marathon or getting to heartbreak hill and the Boston marathon and then they lose that extra push.

Speaker 1:          01:10:07       See, that's what makes sense because that extra push is all what mixed martial arts is about. Yeah. That extra push is all about. I mean in mma it's all about exploding when you're tired. It's all about being able to manage your endurance over the course of five minutes, but figuring out these sprint times and being able to squeeze the most out of those two. Break your opponent. Yeah. It's a lot of times it's based on how much you have in the tank.

Speaker 3:          01:10:29       Yeah, well that's the thing and I mean a lot of it you should still. You can still, even though it's funny, carb loading when it was first a sort of perfected was the developed in Scandinavia by. I'm in back in the fifties, I think it was by the coaches have cross country skiers, which is an incredibly like physically a burden, some brutal, brutal, so. And they trained all year long on low carb diets so they would train on low carb diets and the idea was they would eat the plate of pasta, you know, the race and they would maximize their glycogen stores and they're living in their cells and then when they needed it, it was there. And is that have been proven efficient? Eh? I mean it was a great way for them, but then it was. But again, the point is at reading the low carb diets, the until the year and then once marathoner started doing everyone thought with marathon and she'd eat carbs the night before a marathon, we should always eat carbs.

Speaker 3:          01:11:25       And then this idea that carpenter heart-healthy came in and they just took over the world. So, but my area of expertise is by no means like high performance athletes. There are people out there who could talk to you for, you know, and I'll recommend some when we get off. Um, but you know, it's interesting because even when you read the debates about this stuff, what the high performance athletes, I see this and like outside magazine and runner's world stuff. So there's this fundamental argument that, look, we don't get facts. We too much. We get fat because of carbohydrates in our diet causes hormonal metabolic dysregulation that makes us store calories of fat and our fat cells. And that implies that the healthiest diet for those of us who get fat or diets absent, you know, easily digestible carbs and sugars. But if athletes, very high performing athletes eat those diets and don't perform better than before, it's not a good diet and therefore all the rest of it is wrong and that's just crazy.

Speaker 3:          01:12:26       You know, it's sort of what Lance Armstrong needs to win the Tour de France, whatever it is, doesn't tell me a hell of a lot about why, you know, Shirley Maclaine talk weighs 300 pounds and can't lose that weight unless she gives up carbohydrates, you know, and all of that gets confounded in these discussions. And one of the things I'm constantly doing when I talk about this stuff saying you got to keep your eye on a question because we were all given different answers to different questions. So what's the best diet for winning the Tour de France or mma fight probably got a lot of the same themes that I'm talking about. But even then funny when sugar came in beginning around the 18 nineties and it was a cheap and easily available and beach hooker was available element Germany. The German army started testing sugar as a performance enhancer and actually doing sort of trials where they would send troops out with or without sugar for, you know, 30 day marches, and then they would see when they came back, which ones had more energy and the ones who ate more sugar had more energy and they, a mountain climbers started using it.

Speaker 3:          01:13:37       Um, crew coach has started testing it on the crew, like rowing back then was a, among the most popular sports in the world. And so they would give their rowers a sugar and see if they perform better, which they inevitably did. It was a great performance enhancing drug. It's a psychoactive drug. It kills pain. It is, you know, the joke. It's quick energy. Sugar kills pain. Yeah. It's why we give it the kids, you know, if your baby was he circumcised. I've girls then okay. Not an issue. Boys circumcise them. Give them a little bit of sugar. You never heard of that though? But yeah, it's a distraction. It's a pain killer. I mean, it's a wonderful psychoactive properties. No short term side effects. You know, me and me, you're talking about must be talking about a very minor if you also, if you start with populations that never consumed sugar, babies never consumed it before you came. A little sugar, like on day three you can circumcise them and then they're just tripping. They're fine. Hey, cool. I'll take it off. I don't need to live with what, what am I gonna use that for. I mean, when you know, you're three days old, you got no imagination.

Speaker 5:          01:14:45       Wow. We could talk about um, the uh, yeah. So anyway, that's the thing, I,

Speaker 3:          01:14:56       it's that it could be a performance enhancing drug

Speaker 3:          01:15:00       that would enhance the performance of athletes at the highest level. Doesn't mean it doesn't have longterm chronic affects, just like any other performance enhancing drug. So there's a big difference between people that are like say climbing k two that need something to push them forward versus the average person who likes to play Racquetball and works a day job and you know, and that kind of a diet and think about, I mean the athletic trainers who have been telling you, I mean the guys you work out with your whole, you know, the lean muscular guys who never had an ounce of fat in their lives and they're saying we should all wheat carbs that we should always sugar because I look how well I process it. And my argument is like, if you think your body works the same way as your cousin who weighs 300 pounds and the only differences you exercise more like that's a serious delusion.

Speaker 3:          01:15:52       And you know, we're different people. I don't know. You have siblings? Yes. Are you all built in like a sister? I mean, she's mean she's, I mean she, she works out a little bit. Not, not like I do, but you know, we have good genes in that regard. But I mean, when I was a kid, my older brother, a mathematician, brilliant guy, but he was always taller, leaner, like you could see the veins on his arms and the ripples on his stomach just seven years old by a lot by. It wasn't genetic because I clearly had the same gene to different body types. But they vary, right? Yeah. So when he got to college, he was a rower. He couldn't get over one 95 no matter how much he ate. And he used to say

Speaker 3:          01:16:36       never forget this, I'll never get stuffed or just get bored of eating after a few hours. And I was shorter, thicker, you know, I put on weight relatively easily. By the time I was in high school, I weighed one 95 when I was playing division two, college football, I could get up to 2:37 and no matter how much I ate, I could not get above 2:37 and I was three inches shorter than he was. We just had different body types. We, I've built muscle easier than he did. And I put on fat easier than he did. It had nothing to with how much we both ate as much as we could in fact dinners in our family. I like 18 minutes because it was, you know, my mother was put down like you know, enough for, for eight people and if I didn't trust my brother, yeah, exactly. Started seven over seven, 18, no matter what she served.

Speaker 1:          01:17:28       When you're looking at all this data and you're putting together this book and you realize that you're going to drop this mindblower on people that we're, we've been essentially misled by almost every established organization when it comes to health and diet. How are you feeling when you're about to release it? So you has a 10. Is this one thing we like? Jesus Christ? Am I just do? I mean, did you have this like incredible desire to like double check, triple check, quadruple check?

Speaker 3:          01:17:59       No, but I should have the um. Okay. So the first time this happened, so the articles in science for whatever we're using then create all that much controversy. I mean, they won awards and reporting awards and know they were in books about the best science writing, but nobody really cared. I mean there was enough controversy about whether this low fat diet for instance, was the right thing that I do. This New York Times magazine article where, you know, the idea was to go out and find out that this was pitched in 2001 and the, our awareness of the obesity epidemic was only about three years old and you could pinpoint it in time from between the late 19 seventies to the early 19 nineties, two surveys that were done. And during those two surveys, the prevalence of obesity almost almost doubled. United States, the percentage of Americans. So you'd asked the question what caused it?

Speaker 3:          01:18:59       And I have two hypotheses. One was we had shifted the 19 sixties, that conventional wisdom was that carbohydrates are uniquely fattening. Like one our line, I quote and two of my books was the first sentence of a British journal of Nutrition Article Nineteen Sixty three written by one of the two leading British Dietitians was every woman knows carbohydrates are fattening and every woman knew this car, you know, bread, pasta, potatoes, rice, beer, sweets, you know, they'd go right to your hips. That was a. and then we turned them into a heart healthy diet foods by the 19 eighties and that happened between was institutionalized between 1977 and 1984 and [inaudible] 84 like the New York Times health reporters writing or Beth selling diet health cooking book called the Good Food Book. And she's saying, yeah, we used to think carbs are fattening, but now we should eat pasta and bread all the time.

Speaker 3:          01:19:55       So that was one hypothesis. The other was high fructose corn syrup, which came in in 1977 and had sort of replaced sugar and Pepsi and coke by 1984. Anyways, I'm doing that piece. I realized I find stumbled upon five studies of the Atkins Diet. So the Atkins Diet is the scientists call the anomalous observation. So when you're always looking for in sciences, the anomalous observation, that's the thing that doesn't fit with any of your beliefs, you know, you've got a theory that says this, and then you find that and, and now you've got a way to come up with a better theory because you got something else, you have to explain that you're present theory doesn't and it's the anomalous observations that move science forward. It's the thing that just doesn't fit with your belief. So here's the Diet trials where he got the atkins diet high in fat, high in saturated fat.

Speaker 3:          01:20:46       So she'll give you heart disease, you know, double quarter pounder with cheese, no bun, lobster Newberg, know eggs, bacon, sausage, and you're allowed to eat as much as you want. Okay? So it's not a calorie restricted diet, it's Ad Libitum. As long as you don't eat carbs, you could have eight eggs for breakfast and a rash for a bacon and you know, whole chicken for lunch. So the other theories, theories of fat, it's going to cause heart disease. And the other theory is that the eat as much as you want you to have a fat person and as much as want, they're going to get fatter, right? Because we think they got fat to begin with because they ate too much. And then you compare those people to people you put on an American heart association, low fat diet, and you tell them to calorie restrict my repeating myself. No, go ahead. No, go ahead.

Speaker 3:          01:21:34       You know the ice cream, scoop size tuna salad on the lettuce patty thing that we all went through at some point in their life. Maybe not you if you're naturally lane. Anyway, it all five of these trials and they'd been done but not published yet, and they'd been presented at conferences. The people on the Atkins Diet not only lost more weight than the ones on their calorie restricted American heart association, low fat diet that a whole American people were supposed to eating. So that refutes the eating too much hypothesis because these guys on the atkins diet can eat as much as they want, but their heart disease risk factors are better. Okay? So they're supposed to die of heart disease, you know, eat the bake and a clogs your arteries. You fall over dead, but they were healthier. So it refutes the heart disease thing to. So there's the anomalous observation.

Speaker 3:          01:22:27       How do you explain that? If dietary fat causes heart disease and eating too much cause obesity. So I write this article, I lead it with this young Harvard endocrinologist pediatrician who's feeding low carb diets to his patients at Boston Children's hospital. He's like politically acceptable. He's sincere, he's at Harvard. I want to ease people into it. And then I talked about the Atkins thing down below and how Atkins had gotten pilloried back in the late sixties, early seventies for telling people they could eat these high fat diets because we thought, you know, and what these studies showed and the editors at the New York Times magazine said Atkins is the elephant in the living room. Like get rid of this Harvard guy. Put them down below. Lead with the Atkins. Okay. I mean, they know how to get people to read an article. So I write this lead, I read it to my wife and a chair of the American Medical Association, the American Heart Association, have a find yourself standing naked nightmare in times square, excuse me, find yourself standing naked in times square nightmare.

Speaker 3:          01:23:39       It's that all the advice they've been giving to the American people about a healthy diet for the last 50 years is wrong and maybe atkins was right all along and maybe both and I read it to my wife and I say they will never run this in a million years and I emailed it to the editors and they don't change a word and that's the lead of the magazine article and then they put this picture on the cover of the magazine, which is kind of cheap looking, porterhouse steak. They didn't go to photographer to make a delicious, you know, and it's got a pat of butter and the headline is what if it's all been a big fat lie and I didn't stop them from doing it, but I didn't know what to expect. I knew it was going to be controversial. Getting back to your question, I tend to answer long winded.

Speaker 3:          01:24:27       I knew it was going to be controversial. I knew it was going to be the most controversial article they do run into a friend of mine 10 years earlier, had written an article about how recycling is a complete waste of time and money. I had no idea what was going to happen, no idea. And I compare it to my boxing career. Okay. When I was younger, I had, when I was at Harvard, I, my best friend was a boxer. He was a street Friday from Manhattan, a Puerto Rican kid and a wonderful guy. I mean everyone school loved them and then uh, he taught me how to box and we used to box and the gym and I would do this sort of Muhammad Ali imitation because that's what I thought boxing was in 1977. Then he actually had an amateur fight in low mass and March 19, 77, he got killed in the flesh, Jesus.

Speaker 3:          01:25:17       And of course me being young and stupid, um, uh, it's not enough to prevent me from continuing. So when I moved to New York, watch the fight. Yeah, we were there. There. We didn't know what happened to him. He danced into a right hook and went over backwards. Like it was frozen. It was a plank of wood and his head bounced off the Mat. That is how I remember it. I got notes. My memory is right. It's one of the scariest things is when the head bounces one of the worst ways to get knocked out. Yeah. And we knew it was bad, but we didn't know. He didn't die. He went into was in a coma. They took him to the hospital. We went all home and we. And then a week later there's just no brain activity and they. This how I remember it. I hope I'm doing them justice by getting the memory right.

Speaker 3:          01:26:03       Of course, nowadays you can google it and read about the article in the Boston Globe and it wasn't article. Anyway, I moved to New York. I'd go to journalism school. I have a friend who is norman mailer's nephew, and Norman mailer had a group of people used to get together at the gramercy gym on Saturday mornings in New York. Um, this another long winded answer to your question. I talked about shaggy dog story. So every Saturday morning we meet at the gramercy gym, which is the 14th and around Lexington when it was back then it was a very seedy neighborhood and it was, you know, a classic gym. Yeah. Classic boxing and some really, like Ryan O'Neal was buddies with Norman would show up once every three months. And there was a guy who ran, I forget, it was a porn magazine that was sold the Brown paper bag. He would show up and then a half dozen other people I had this friend Steve Chow went on to, uh, um, become uh, barry diller's righthand man.

Speaker 3:          01:27:01       And yeah, Hollywood would actually been the Valedictorian of our class at Harvard and we would spar and um, I enjoyed it and I got into it and I was getting the crap beat out of me first. But eventually I, you know, I kept doing it. And then I decided to fight in the New York golden gloves and write about it for playboy. So the piece was called, um, what a life is a standing eight count. Hello? I'm sorry. But this is after your friend died. This is after my friend died. Wow. So anyway, the point is kind of like going from sparring to your first match now you had a much more successful career than I did. I had two flights and I'm, I'm one of the first one because the Irish cop I was fighting got tired of punching me and I finally thought if I hit him back, maybe that'll slow them down.

Speaker 3:          01:27:51       It worked. But that transition from sparring to being in the ring and having someone to beat the crap out of you is like, you just can't, you cannot conceive of what it's going to be like until you do it. Right. I mean if you can remember back to your first flight and you might've been more of a natural animal than I am. I'm kind of a cerebral guy. I think too much, but that's what it was like getting this article published. Like I knew it was going to be controversial. You want me to tell you the end of the boxing story? Sure. And one of my first fight, I knocked out this cop from Staten Island. Then I was done. I didn't want to do it again. I didn't enjoy winning. I did not enjoy knocking them out. I didn't like anything about it. This nose was not built for getting pummeled and I was not a very good defensive fighter.

Speaker 3:          01:28:40       And then the second fight I went up against the guy who wanted, you know, this was the not the open category, the 10 flights or less category and he knocked me out in a minute and 37 seconds. I had a friend who, a photographer for life who came. Norman mailer was at the flight to Norman sitting there watching me get the crap beat out of me and my friend was a photographer. Didn't have time to get her lens cap off. Basically she, you know, so that I have a photo that ran in playboy with the article which was, could she bring level when you see these two big feet sticking up in this body, prone on the ring, you know, did you get knocked unconscious when you woke up? How terrified were you thinking at all about your friend who died? No, that's the funny thing.

Speaker 3:          01:29:26       Not at all, but I thought about it afterwards, so it's interesting. Apparently, you know, I woke up in the ring. I mean I stood up, they raised the other guy's hand. I don't remember any of that. My memory of the fight at all, a little bit. A little bit of like these roundhouses whizzing by my head and I had this tendency I would like pull my head back so I'm pulling my hands down instead of terrible instinct. Natural for some strange reason. It's very difficult to teach people to not do the worst thing. Yeah. And you know, if my career had lasted past that fight, my very good coach would have broken it down to me. Would've said don't ever do that again. And you know. Anyway, I, my memory is I, I'm sitting outside the ring and the doctor is saying to me, do you know what your name is?

Speaker 3:          01:30:11       Do you know what you know? So there's a period of my life was clearly conscious, but I have no memory of it. Um, then they, they make you go to the hospital afterwards to make sure you're not going to die overnight. And that was in the emergency room and there was a guy next to me who had had a motorcycle accident and cabot cut him off and he had the same. We were talking, he was about my age Hispanic and he, um, you know, this thing where there's no way you say the next thing I remember. And then there's this awareness that there could vary. It could very well have never been in. Next thing I remember, you know, the moment could have just ended there and that's what I started thinking about my friend. But I was too busy getting mad at the hospital attended, who kept telling me that my nose was broken and I kept saying, my nose isn't broken, asshole.

Speaker 3:          01:31:02       This is the notes. I was born with a man that's a broken nose, know broken nose when I see one, but anyway, that's, that was a little bit. So I published this article. I've got no idea what's going to happen and you know, it was like just the universe. I mean, first of all, there's an enormous amount of media attention, so I'm doing tv shows and radio shows and people are writing about me, but people are attacking me because the implication is not just did the nutrition, obesity community screw up, but my journalist friends who have been covering this field screwed up that they got the wrong story. They missed the story that I found and nobody wants to think like that. You don't want to think you're bad at what you do. Right. So you know, friends or writing articles about me, you know, one woman journalist in Boston or used to be a good friend who thought it was one of the five best writers in the country, science journalists in the country until I wrote a piece that came to a different conclusion than a book she had written on obesity and the headline and Newsweek was it not the carbs stupid, you know.

Speaker 3:          01:32:13       Um, the center for science in the public interest did a piece called big fat lies cover of their newspaper. Basically explaining how I had screwed up on everything I had screwed up. Another journalist who had written a book on obesity, did a piece for reason magazine about all the ways I had screwed up. And Luckily I hadn't screwed up in any of them so I could get back at them and take them down.

Speaker 1:          01:32:35       But when you did get back at them and take them down, you're talking about a time where, I mean

Speaker 3:          01:32:39       year was this, this was 2002. So you had a blog, did you have none of that? Oh, well did you publish a center for Science? And the public interest piece, they wouldn't even let me respond. Reason magazine was interesting. I called up the editors and I said, look, this is just complete bullshit and you got to let me respond. And they said, okay, they didn't care because they put it online. So with the is going to write for them for free, let them write for them for free, you know, and the more controversy brings more readers. So I spent the weekend, I remember I wrote like a 9,000 word response and there's still some great stuff in there were, you know, even the very end of this thing, I was pointing out every way this guy had screwed up, like taken down my article by saying I made mistakes when he was the one making mistakes in that last line was something like he had called my editor who had now bought this book for a lot of money. He had called my editor on the gate use the last night. It's called them Richard Seagull or something. So the last line of the book wasn't just the final word. My editor's name is not Richard Segal, it's John Period, you know, 9,000 word takedown and this guy ended up never writing for reason magazine again. Either graduations. Yeah, he got rid of an asshole. So

Speaker 1:          01:33:59       analysis, it's the human ego is shocking and horrifying because that's the only reason why someone would look at what you wrote and step back and look at what they wrote and decide to attack. Instead of deciding to go, wow, this guy went deep with this research. I need to really look at this and I need to really find out whether or not I've been incorrect and I need to really reevaluate what kind of advice I've been giving to humans. Think about the hundreds of thousands or maybe even millions of people that have read articles from these people that gave them poor advice and that advice adversely affected their health directly. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But again, which that instead they cover their ass enough program could do that. They are wave that's remembering, you know, dietary mushrooms.

Speaker 3:          01:34:45       We're a member of my brothers is at low dose asset thing, so it's like I could really transform my personality. I could become a different person. I. Have you tried it before? No, no. I'm a little that I'll become a. I'm going to try now. That's what's going to happen. I have to, uh, let me know after the show. I have to have to be able to get to burbank. Burbank on acid. Best Way. Yeah. There we go. Thank you. Instinctively know where Jay Leno's garage is? Yeah. It'd be like a beacon, like seat above. You know how you have a three d map and it's got that little balloon where your relocation. Okay. Were there. Hey, I live in Oakland. We don't need it. We don't need help with cyber up. There were good. The, um. Anyway, so yeah, it's just, it's a natural human tendency. Wish you wish somebody would say, Jesus, I never thought of this. That's all they need to say. They have to say, we never thought of this. This is an interesting take. Clearly the editors at the New York Times magazine are really smart. People thought this was interesting, the fact checkers fact check that there's no mistakes. That's why at least I was safe there because they're really good fact checker that didn't rely on me. Why don't we,

Speaker 3:          01:36:00       and it just doesn't happen. I mean, it was funny. Even afterwards I start doing this book and now I'm going to interview hundreds more people and you would expect that a lot of the scientists aren't going to talk to me because they're going to be so mad at me about this article, but most of them actually were good. There was one scientist I wanted to talk to specifically because a guy I was talking to said he hated your article. I thought it was total crap, so I sent him an email and I said, yeah, I'd like to interview you. I'm right here. He thought the article was total crap and I'd like to know why, because if it was, I want to make sure I don't make those mistakes again. And he said, sure, as long as you make sure you check all my quotes because I don't trust you to get my quotes right, because that was another story that was going around at the time and two weeks later we get on the phone and he says, you know, I got to apologize

Speaker 3:          01:36:54       when I read your article was so pissed off by the title, what if it's all been a big fat lie and your holier than now smarter than we are at attitude that I never actually thought deeply about what you're saying. And I pretty much agree with you now that I've read it again in context is everything in these things. So. And I noticed that when I lecture, so I give a lot of lectures. I talked to the grand rounds and medical schools. If somebody introduces me to a room full of doctors is this is a very well respected journalists. He's won all these awards, including these influential public health awards. He's written this incredibly thoughtful provoking book and we managed to get him here to give you the arguments. The doctors will be completely receptive to everything I say. I've also had people introduce me as, yeah, here's this Guy Taubes.

Speaker 3:          01:37:45       He wrote this big book, he says, everything we say is wrong and he's going to give a lecture, and now it's like they're tuned out from day one. From the moment I opened my mouth, they're looking for reasons not to believe a word. I just crossed post sitting. Exactly, and then they're looking at the phones five minutes later and checking their email. It sort of. So context is everything and by making this article as controversial as it could with putting actions in the lead and porterhouse steak on the cover and what if it's all been a big fat lie and I actually wasn't calling it a lie as a lot of mistaken assumptions, a lot of bad science, but nobody lied. Did you create it, the title? No, but I didn't. That's always what happens, right? I didn't reject it on there so I get right title, but that's the thing.

Speaker 3:          01:38:30       So it got me a big book advance. It made it exceedingly controversial, but it turned a lot of people off because they were being accused of things they didn't want to think of themselves, especially the lie. Well perhaps the dam, but initially, but over the course of time it's got a lot of support behind it now, but so many people you've been recommended to me by at least a half a dozen people that I deeply respect. Well, this is the thing. It's, it's an extraordinarily powerful intervention. When you experience and you weren't even overweight, you know, this is a good point. Yeah. Two things that you know, when I talked to my colleagues about this, I say it's like you're playing in a poker game with a thousand people in the establishment and they cheat because they all talk to each other and they share cards and they show each other what they get.

Speaker 3:          01:39:22       They tell them what they're going to bet, but God keeps stealing you for aces. You've got the best hand, you know, and the best hand is you shift your diet. You get rid of the carbs and you replace them with fat and it does remarkable things to most people. Not all. Okay. Because I want to talk to the people that it doesn't work on. I really do. I want to know what they're actually doing. The problem with people when they, you know, it, it's so, it's so subjective and it's also, you don't exactly know how they're doing it, what, what, what their diet is like in terms of like how would they cutting out carbs, what kind of nutrients are they taking in? What's or what's the rest like? I'm sleep. Are they getting. That's the thing. I mean, I have a friend, a diet book author.

Speaker 3:          01:40:09       I think one of the smartest doctors out there. I'm always, whatever he says, it's always worth listening to. He believes that when people fail in the die, it doesn't matter what age they are, what sex they are, when the Diet doesn't return them to a relatively healthy weight, he believes it's because they're not conforming to the um, I disagree with him actually, but again, he has more. Any Diet period. No, the low carb high fat diet, so you know, maybe they're reading too many nuts and there's carbs and nuts or maybe they're lying to him about what they're doing or they're still having the occasional sweet and clearly there are people who try to compromise on these diets. If I compromise, I mean you've been hearing so long that fat is bad for you, so I, I'm sure I'm going to restrict, you know, sugar and grain and starches, but I'm also gonna restrict fat.

Speaker 3:          01:40:57       Now you're reading skinless chicken breasts with green vegetables and you're not even putting butter on it and it tastes awful and nobody's going to stick to that diet anyway. And in order to give the skinless chicken breast some flavor, you got to marinate in some sugar, right? So, and the protein and they didn't wanna eat a high protein diet because you're going to convert the protein to glucose, some of those amino acids and that's going to raise blood sugar and that can be a problem. So maybe they're just doing them wrong, but there are a lot of hormones that influence fat accumulation. So this is rumors had the Germans and Austrians had concluded, maybe I didn't say this, I can't even remember what I. I've been doing this book tour, so I got it. Germans and Austrians Research said, look, this has got to be a hormonal metabolic issue.

Speaker 3:          01:41:46       The whole idea that it's just calories in, calories out is it's an explanation. It's like somebody gets heavier, they take in more calories than they expend. We know that it's like somebody accumulate energy and their fat tissue, they were accumulating energy in their body, which means they're taking in energy more than they expected. That's just a description of what happens. It says nothing about why, you know they're clearly. Hormones play a huge role in fat accumulation or men and women would look identical. Okay, so boys go through puberty, they lose fat and gain muscle. Girls go through puberty, they gained fat and very specific places like not everywhere, you know, place. It's designed to drive the boys crazy and get some procreation going. And that's all hormonal. It's all estrogen and the girls testosterone and the boys, you know, little mix going on. It doesn't matter how many calories they're consuming, so these Germans and Austrians would say it's, you know, it's clearly a hormonal thing.

Speaker 3:          01:42:47       I meant the only way you could explain obesity is a hormonal dysregulation, and then in the sixties we learned that insulin controls fat accumulation, dominant hormone, but these other hormones play a role as well. So stress hormones play a role, and sex hormones play a role, so estrogen and testosterone both inhibit an enzyme called lipoprotein lipase that when it's on your fat cells basically pulls fat out of the circulation and into the cell. That's a simplistic way to put it. So when you're pumping out estrogen and testosterone, you're inhibiting this enzyme which inhibits fat accumulation. Then you get older, you secrete less. These hormones, women go through menopause, they secrete less estrogen. The light bulb protein lipase is upregulated on their fat cells, so you get more of it, so it just starts accumulating fat. No matter how much the woman wants to eat or exercise, and this is why they put on fat when they get older.

Speaker 3:          01:43:49       I think women are program to put on fat when they're pregnant. Men are never really programmed to put on fat, but women have a fat accumulation program when they're pregnant and it sort of kicks in a little bit as they go through menopause until I think historically when you look at the anecdotal evidence, uh, you know, older women have a much harder time losing excess body fat, even on very calorie carbohydrate restricted ketogenetic diets and it would be completely understandable. And the argument I make is that the, um, it would still be the best diet, still be the leanest. They could be, you know, for all intents and purposes by getting rid of carbs, but it does not mean that it's gonna work or it's going to work as much as they wanted to because of these other sex hormones and the influence on body fat as well.

Speaker 3:          01:44:41       And perhaps the only way to adjust that would be extreme exercise, right? Like then don't have to go crazy crossfit or start running up hills with weights on them. Something, you know. And that's a question I don't know, and that wouldn't address it. That would be sort of a temporary fix, you know? So you might be able to stimulate some more, even testosterone production, I mean, uh, but temporary fix, unless you continue that activity. Yeah. And, but the problem is, if it may be virtually, you know, again, I, here's my issue with Cri. I, I don't know, there was a harvard psychologist in the 50 forties and fifties named William Sheldon who came up with this idea. I'm gonna. Need some googling here, by the way, I have three different fundamental body types. So there's an echo more Sunday mezzo morph. And uh, what was the endomorph which is the obese one, endomorph endomorph.

Speaker 3:          01:45:40       And he said, and which the thin what act? So he said, you can no more, you could starve an ectomorph and you don't turn them into an, you can starve an endo more if you don't turn them into an Ectomorph, you turn them into an a macerated endomorph. Okay. It's like you cannot. And I don't know if it was his metaphor. Mine, I forget now you, you can't starve a basset hound and turn it into a greyhound and you just end up with a basset hound. Genetic factors determined by the environment with our ancestors developed, uh, and the environment in the mother's womb and the, and the, you know, uh, and it's not necessarily, like I said, genetic and it certainly biological factors. Who knows, maybe that gut biome is involved. I doubt it. But there's also the shapes of the bodies are radically different.

Speaker 3:          01:46:24       That's the thing with the shoulders and morphs. Yeah, yeah, yeah. My brother was an actor. I mean he was, he was always tall and thin and he got one 95. He was buff, but he wasn't. I could put on muscle much easier than him. I could put on fat. I had a friend who was a taekwondo champion in the eighties and he was six foot two, six foot maybe three. And he fought at 147 pounds. Yeah. And you wouldn't get anywhere from six to. When I start, I'll start with, I'll starve to death at one 75. But it was in his hands. It was in the shape of his face. He was very narrow feet everything. It's just. And that's how his body. So part of this alternative hypothesis, which I find so you know, we believe today is, you know, the conventional thinking is how much are we next besides drives, how much fat do you accumulate?

Speaker 3:          01:47:14       And the alternative hypothesis is that how much fat you accumulate is very well regulated by the human body. Other you could change that regulation by changing the macronutrients. So people who fat tissue doesn't want to accumulate fat, who are constitutionally lean. Your body when they eat a meal, they can't store it as fat temporarily. They get a burn all those calories. So the way they'd burn it in prior to the 19 fifties, a clinician studying obese, you talked about the impulse to physical activity. So you eat, you know Lance Armstrong eats a thousand calories of pasta and his body doesn't want to store it as fat. It wants to burn it. So he goes for three hour bike ride after lunch because his body's trying desperately to get rid of those calories and it doesn't want a storm is fat. I have the thousand calories a pasta, my body's happy storing fat and I'm asleep an hour later.

Speaker 3:          01:48:08       But I'm not thicker and fatter than Armstrong because I'm asleep. I'm asleep because that's the way my body processed carbs. But is that a case of nature or nurture? That's nature. Hundred percent. But it's. No, it's not because the nurture part is healthy diet influences. So if I have exclusively fat and protein, if I'm eating a key to genic diet that I'm minimizing fat accumulation of my body wants to burn more calories. So I am closer to being a lance. So Lance Armstrong can be lean on his high carb diet. I am closer to being Lance Armstrong, like closest on a diet to absent doll carbohydrates. But I'm still, you know, now I'm just a bigger individual. I mean, it's interesting. We were talking about, uh, uh, you know, I was talking to a friend of mine who was a freshman manager of my college football team. So this was harvard.

Speaker 3:          01:49:08       Okay. It was division two football. It was a lot of smart, you know, guys who couldn't make it in division one. We had kids who went to Harvard because they didn't get scholarships at Holy Cross. So they went, okay, I'll play football for Harvard. They were local 19, 76. My senior year, the biggest kid on our team, Danny tickets weighed 265 pounds, six foot five from our standards. Who was enormous. He went off to play for the Chicago bears for five or six years. I think we had one other offensive lineman who was to 65 also six, four, six, five, maybe two this year. Harvard football team, a smart kid, same socioeconomic status. The entire offense have they got I think 12 players over 300 pounds. His cronies guys were enormous. I mean there are six slash seven, 300 pounds. They didn't grow people that big when I was growing up.

Speaker 3:          01:50:07       I mean I could say maybe I didn't see him. Maybe they weren't around. Maybe they were six, seven and they only weighed 2:30 because they weren't being bulked up. So they were playing basketball instead of football. I mean, I could imagine ways that that confusing, but from our perception, if you look just what happened when I was a kid in early 19 sixties there, as far as I know, there was one, 300 pounder in the NFL and the AFL, two different leads back then. Bob De remember his name, he played for the Boston Patriots and his head was like small compared to his body and he was a big fat guy. You know what is there now? Twenty, 30 per team.

Speaker 1:          01:50:50       Well, here's a good example, big George Foreman from 1970, whatever it was when he fought Joe Frazier, he only 217 pounds.

Speaker 3:          01:50:59       Is that George? Only way?

Speaker 1:          01:51:01       Yeah, I mean when he came back, when he came back, when he took a long time off, he ate himself to be well over 300

Speaker 3:          01:51:10       training. All the fat from the George Foreman Grill

Speaker 1:          01:51:14       making low fat grows even after that, but back in those days when he was a terror before he fought Muhammad Ali, who's relatively small. By today's standards, I mean if you look at a UFC heavyweight champions, steep emile chick, I believe Steve a walks around about 240 pounds and he's small compared to Brock Lesnar who's 285 pounds. Like here's a good example that Jamie just pulled up from 1927 guy blow your nose man. You figured me out the other one. Okay, here everybody could hear it. Trust me, they can hear it. I'm 190 pounds Morris read but bad drew grow. How do you say that name B, a d, g, r o bad bro. That grow. He's growing bad. That's why he's only one 90. He's six foot tall. 100 90 and this is 19, 27. He played offense and defense for the New York giants. So that guy is 10 pounds lighter than me and I'm five. Eight. Yeah, he's six foot tall and he's a pro football player, which is fucking terrifying to me. And then you go to 1967 and you've got Alan page. He's six foot four, 245 pounds. A relative giant in comparison. Then you go to 2006 and you have boy, say that name. How long have you got? A lot. Nada, Nada, Nada, Nada. I think you don't pronounce the Gentleman Pranab. She is. Hello? Nada. Okay. And he is six foot four. Three hundred 35 pounds. He's got a big old gut. Him could lose some weight.

Speaker 4:          01:52:47       It's 45 seconds. Wow, that's insane. So He's a giant. I mean people are just starting left tackle for the Dallas cowboys right now. I forget his name. Just Google left tackle. Dallas cowboys or even a heavyweight boxers today. Tyrone Smith. That's good to get a picture of it as a big fella. Okay. Shirt off without the shirt off. Let's go. Pornographic. Okay. So they're not. I mean, people didn't exist like that when I was growing.

Speaker 1:          01:53:19       Yeah. There's this new heavyweight that's fighting for the UFC. His name is Francis in Ghana and he's one of the most exciting prospects in the UFC right now. He's a heavyweight. He's undefeated and he is fucking enormous. And uh, he is probably. Yeah, go to that picture right there. That far left far left. Jamie upper left. Yeah, he's, I mean that is a giant man. Ridiculous, brutal knockout artists too. And um, let me go to go see if there's a wikipedia on his size, but I'm pretty sure he's super lean around 2:45, something like that. What does it say? They're six foot four. It doesn't say his weight right there. It says waiting anywhere there.

Speaker 4:          01:54:03       Two 50. Seven to 57. Okay. So he's 40. He's 40 pounds heavier. That may or may not be correct as far as

Speaker 1:          01:54:12       wait, but close in. I wouldn't be shocked. He's one of those guys where he walks into the octagon and you know, when I do commentary, I sit at a desk that's touching the octagon. So I'm sitting here, there's a desk, my notes are on it. He's in front of me. When he walks into the octagon, I can feel his footsteps on my hands. He's like, he's made out of stone. And then when he hits people, just Jesus Christ, you see the look on their face when he hits him, see if he can find like a, like

Speaker 4:          01:54:39       quick highlight reel of this guy. That was interesting. Some of that, I mean, training has changed dramatically. Like even for sure George, I mean, you know, boxers didn't lift, they didn't do resistance training, didn't do any of the bags back thing because he didn't want to slow them down. That's what they led this boom. He's a giant dude French too.

Speaker 1:          01:55:01       Yes, French. But I believe originally from Nigeria I believe. And really look at that. Boom, big powerful guy. Terrifying guy.

Speaker 4:          01:55:12       So here's the thing, one of my pet theories, I don't talk about this, why I let my kids have sugar by the way. Ouch. The uh, okay. So one of the things that happens when you increase insulin, so the sugar, the sugar, because on some resistant that results in chronic increases and insulin levels. So insulin stimulates fat accumulation, but it also stimulates the secretion of insulin, like growth hormone, which is similar to growth hormone. So the reason we grow is not because growth hormone drives tissues and skeletal muscle grow, but it drives

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       into like growth factor, which then works on a local level. So if you have more insulin in your system, you can have more insulin like growth factor and it's going to be more bioavailable. Um, there's these proteins binding proteins that float around the bloodstream and they'll bind to igf growth factor and make it so can't get into cells or can't bind to the receptors. So you would expect as populations, as populations have become more intense in some resistance, you would expect them to grow to be taller as well as thicker and fatter and more diabetic. And one of the classic observations as populations become Westernized, they get taller and this, you know, you look at medical records or army records from, you know, the civil war and everybody weld them and we're like five foot six and um, you know, now clearly the average height has gone up and it's kind of leveled off a bit in the United States.

Speaker 3:          01:56:38       But there's still countries in Europe or it's gotten higher. And one of the things that freaks me out is when they go to Europe nowadays and you're walking around a lot of scandinavians and I feel petite Holland. Yeah. Rich Man in Holland is over six foot tall. When I was growing up I was definitively tall and now I haven't shrunk. I don't think it might be getting there and now it's just like everyone seemed six, four, six, five. So the conventional thinking is they get more calories, I get more protein that you need the protein for the growth and the calories and that's kind of the explanation, but it could be that they get more sugar and that drives vertical growth as well as horizontal growth. And will that make sense? Because don't bodybuilders like under extreme situations, don't they take insulin in order to.

Speaker 3:          01:57:25       Yeah. Yeah, because it'll, it'll drive muscle development as well. I mean, again, it works as a growth hormone and igf is a growth hormone. So could there be an argument for bodybuilders to consume a diet that's high in sugar in order to, to spike up that insulin to, you know, now you're getting out of my area of expertise again. But it's funny, when Arnold came over in the sixties, the, one of the advantages he had, other than, you know, massive amounts of steroid consumption was that he, this, I forget who his mentor was back then, but they put them on a very low carb diet because that definitely cuts the fat. So again, this is far out of my area of expertise, but you get a bodybuilder and they'll tell you how they, you know, um, uh, you know, oscillate between the high carbs for development, high fat to cut the fat and get down to. I had this debate. Do you know Alan Aragon? No, no. Yeah, yeah. I know who that guy is. So Allen, we had a debate. Yeah. He's like, he's very skeptical. Oh, it's a kind way to put it. And I think it's a bit of A. I don't get it. I always wanted to ask him like, Alan, what you know, you know, that this isn't. I'm arguing that that defined his position because he has no calories. It's just all about. And you get people

Speaker 4:          01:58:42       to exercise and off field turn an obese person lean. And you know, if that, I mean, the implication that it can happen, but you know, who the fuck is going to do it the way you would have to do it, you would essentially have to starve your body. Well, but this is the point. It's like I could get it done that way. I know, but it doesn't say any reason. It doesn't say anything about why they got fat to begin with. I didn't say anything about the damaging effects of sugar and I could inhibit your kid's growth by starving them. Right. You know, when they're going to be stunted. But that doesn't mean they're growing because they get to eat as much as they want. They're growing because their brains are secreting growth hormone, stimulate igf. And that makes them hungry. So what is he denying about? I Dunno, we rented

Speaker 3:          01:59:23       Bait in England that, uh, it was about a. I don't quite understand what he was denying. That was the interesting thing. He basically was denying that it was about that obesity was a hormonal metabolic disorder. He had a denied that a journalist knows something that he doesn't and that the advice he's been giving and that what he's been voicing over the years is right and what is, does a medical background. Uh, he's got no medical background. He's a physical trainer. Maybe it's an exercise physiologist, he's no more doctor and nutritionist and I am the, um, the point since I was looking for ways to debate him. So I found a clip, a need internet, one of his lectures where he was talking about how there was one particular athlete, he was training a bodybuilder. He had to get maximum caught for the competition. So he cut his carbs down and if he cut the carbs preferentially you do that because you're going to reduce insulin and you're going to mobilize maximum amount of fan. You're going to get the most possible fat out of the fat tissue by doing it. And it clearly meant he believes what I believe, but some people just, you know, you got to establish what, how did he respond to that? He laughed. Everybody laughed. He got kind of embarrassed, but it was a, you know, it was an interesting debate. It was a fitness expo in, I forget what, you know, red brick town in England, you know, one of these.

Speaker 4:          02:00:52       The reason why I keep bringing him up is because I've been. I've been contacted by fans of his have been in communication with him at one point in time and I didn't realize how strongly against this proposition he is or this. Yeah, well you should. You should get him to do the show. I mean, he's very chatty, talkative guy and he'll explain it to you and then you could argue and we could argue, but what it does, what does he say about the impact of sugar? Like does he deny all these things that you're talking to them about bds and we did not say this debate.

Speaker 3:          02:01:26       I would hate to get Allan's position wrong, but if he's implying that obesity is an energy balance problem, it's calories in, calories out. I. That seemed to be the argument. He was defending vociferously when we debated. That in turn means that the only way that foods can influence your body weight is through their, a caloric content, and that means sugar is, you know, an empty calorie than where she could say about it.

Speaker 1:          02:01:55       Clearly not true. If sugar actually does affect your hormonal state and that affects the way your body processes

Speaker 3:          02:02:02       fat. I was so, he went on insulin. If he were to believe that, then he would have been conceding that I won the debates, I'm going to say, which he clearly doesn't think I did. And um, you know, frankly I didn't because the crowd was 100 percent with him when we started and it was like 95 percent with them when we left. But that's still pretty good. That's what I would argue. But uh, and I learned my lesson that you can't win a debate when you're going in and everyone sides with your now why did they all signed with him as they love sugar now? What was under, it wasn't about sugars, but the cause of obesity. We were actually debating different things. Was kind of, it was a weird situation. I think I may have blocked it out of my head, but we were debating, you know, again, my argument, obesity, I'm what I thought we were supposed to be debating was whether or not obesity is caused by consuming too many calories or the macronutrient contents influencing this sort of hormonal metabolic regulation of fat accumulation. Um, what we ended up debating was whether or not the people in the audience would rather be trained by Alan Aragon and the physical trainer, exercise physiologist or Gary Taubes, the journalist because that's kind of ridiculous. It is kind of ridiculous. And it was a bizarre experience. And you know, it was, uh, it was, it was an interesting trip. And you learn your lesson

Speaker 1:          02:03:29       conversations with people before and that the problem with those conversations is it's, you're, you're taking a very simplistic approach to a very complex scenario. You know, if you did work out more and if you did do all these different things, you're going to affect your body and your hormone levels. If you start doing deep squats with heavy weights, you start doing dead lifts and you start putting a weight vest on that hiking up hills, you're going to massively affect the way your body produces hormones. Your body is going to ramp up, it's going to deal with these new domains, going to change the way you partitioned fuels. Since things are gonna happen. See, it's not as simple as a lot of people like to point it out. And then people see they seem to want to do it as a math problem. You know, calories in, calories out. I

Speaker 3:          02:04:12       just said that I gave. I was in Altadena on Sunday talking at a skeptic society meeting. We'll go to Altadena, Michael Shermer, Michael, um, and it was during the torrential rain storms, so it was touch and go getting there because the roads were flooded. But um, just one guy sitting in the audience, the front row, um, it was a calorie restricted or you know, one of these guys who eats like eight, he lives on 1800 calories a day cause he's thinks he's going to live longer and asked him if he wants to spar, I'll get tired and about 20 seconds.

Speaker 3:          02:04:52       There's not a lot of. Well, the other thing with those guys, there's not a lot of muscle tone, right? Because they don't have enough calories. Dead Man walking so that anyway, I'm going to live forever. And Skeleton, this is, I did give a talk to the calorie restriction society. I'm digressing again. This is in Novato north or San Francisco. And I got one of the guys in the email afterwards said, and I was explaining that I thought all the benefits of calorie restriction come from carbohydrate restriction because there's a lot of evidence suggesting that wouldn't make sense if it is beneficial. It's because these guys minimum minimize insulin and igf secretion. And um, you can minimize insulin igf, but just not eating the carbs. And then you get the fuel, the rest of your body, so you get the calories you need to get the protein, you need to get the fat you need, you don't eat the thing that stimulates insulin.

Speaker 3:          02:05:39       Igf. And after the lecture I got an email from a guy in the audience who is part of this society who said, you know, I'm going to experiment. I should get back with him to see what happened. It was like four years ago. He said, you look so much healthier than all of us. And your argument was compelling. I'm going to experiment to see if maybe there's something to what you say and I'm going to shift over from eating, you know, 1800 calories of like 50 percent carbs to 1800 or maybe 2,500 or who knows how many of protein and fat. Well, I had Dr

Speaker 1:          02:06:11       Rhonda Patrick on the other day and she was discussing some pretty compelling evidence about the amount of time that you eat during the day and intermittent fasting and the importance of only eating within a 10 hour period from the morning. You wake up to the time you stopped eating no more than 10 hours and then the rest of your day, the remaining 14 hours, no food. Well, and it's interesting because even, um, but she was talking about the massive benefits of that and in terms of gaining and lean muscle mass just from doing that, losing body fat just from doing that.

Speaker 3:          02:06:43       Yeah. You know, I'm, I'm skeptical of everything. I try to be as skeptical of my ideas as others. Although people say I fail, but I, I haven't read those studies closely. I'll get them to you after we get out of

Speaker 1:          02:06:57       send it to you and send you the, the actual podcast itself. I think you'll find it pretty fascinating.

Speaker 3:          02:07:01       Yeah. And you know, the issue is, I don't doubt it works. I know people who had trouble losing, you know, significant weight on low carb diets and then switched intermittent fasting and broke through. Um, uh, you know, there are some people I know in the field who I like, who think that you might get excessive stress hormone stimulation from the fast thing so that the long term effects may not be as beneficial as a kid agentic diet where you're not a zero evidence of that cortisol. Uh, that would be,

Speaker 4:          02:07:36       yeah, my understanding, I haven't paid a lot of attention, but based on people with a carbohydrate rich diet or people fat rich diet. Let's Google. I'm Steve Finney, P H I n n e y and fasting. I love this by the way. It's like I don't need a memory. All those concussions, you know, it doesn't matter anymore how many concussions you have, buddy. I think between football. And so you say between football. I started thinking between football and boxing, I'd say five or six. That's it. No, you got off light. I did get off flight. Steven Dot Finney on making a low carb diet. Sustainable. We want to do Steve Finney, a intermittent try. Intermittent fast thing.

Speaker 5:          02:08:19       I'm uh,

Speaker 4:          02:08:22       let's see if we pull up low car preserves. Well that's obvious.

Speaker 5:          02:08:27       Uh,

Speaker 4:          02:08:31       cutting edge fat burning podcasting. Yeah. Okay. We're done. Go. Whoa, hold on. That's true. Between the world's most cutting edge fat burning performance media plan, the Keto Diet. Okay. Well anyway, we'll get into that. We, you don't have much time left because you're going to have to bail soon to catch a flight. Um, so I don't wanna I don't wanna make you miss your flight, but this is um, you know, another thing that people can look into once they're done with the intro thing, even the intermittent fast. And the interesting thing is there's two ways to think of it. One is, well, okay, your reading life, fewer calories and that's how it works, right? And the other is you're maximizing the amount of time during the day when insulin and igf are low and when you're saying eating fewer cowers because that's not necessarily what they're talking I'm talking about, is taking time and allowing your body to process all those nutrients.

Speaker 4:          02:09:19       Yeah. And not using the resources that could be developing muscle and in building your body up. So that would account for the increase in lean muscle mass simply by following this intermittent fasting program. Although it's interesting, I don't know if you had this experience when you went on the Ketogenic Diet. So what I want to, because you often read, people say, well you lose. I was looking at a study today that was done in one week study done like 1967 where they lost more protein on the ketogenetic diet that a calorie restricted diet. They were all calorie restricted. But when I went on this diet, it was interesting. My waist size went down and my jacket size went up and I probably my upper body, my lower body doesn't work because of the cartilage in the knees. And the other wonderful things football left me with. But um, you know, I just, I'm stronger now than I was when I was in college. I was working out three hours a day. I'm going to tell how old are you now? Sixty. Look. Great, thank you. Oh, you look good. Too Cute. But, uh, anyway, so what's the point? The point is by changing the time at which you reading, and I believe you could probably eat this many calories, maybe need more calories by doing it. It's not calorie thing, it's

Speaker 3:          02:10:33       a how does your body respond to having more time is low insulin levels basically and low more time at low igf levels and I could imagine even in the low carb diets when people are prescribing them 50 years ago, 60 years ago, they used to prescribe a walk before breakfast, which is interesting because that's the time when your insulin levels are lowest. That's a time when you really mobilizing the fat from your fat tissue. Um, so in that sense, skipping breakfast, prolonging the amount of time before your first meal in the day would actually maximize his time when you're mobilizing fat. I don't have people prefer fasting cardio. They, they, they enjoy that wake up in the morning and having hard cardio or some sort of a hard workout first thing in the morning. Well, and it's interesting because that's the point of the day when they're most likely to be burning fat rather than glucose.

Speaker 3:          02:11:24       If they're not drinking a juice or soda beforehand, I could never do and I always wanted to be able to do cardio first. We certainly could. You just don't want to know. I ended up. I'm just elevated the whole day. It's like I'm dragging my ass. Although I cannot wake up afterwards. It's just my reality doesn't do it, but it's even if I got you. I got two kids. I got a two boys, 11 and eight and I feed him breakfast in the morning and I. I Cook Him Dinner Maybe three times a week. My wife's a vegetarian so I got to cook the meat if I want them to eat animals they have their body clocks are entirely different. They have very different body types. My youngest is not hungry in the morning and my oldest is and my youngest at night, like if you put pasta in front of him, he would just keep eating it and needing it, needing it until you finally just say no more, you're going to blow up.

Speaker 3:          02:12:17       My eldest in the evening doesn't care. It's not interested in, you know, he'll eat a little bit. He could skip dinner even like entirely different body types, but timing of their hunger, which has got to be related to insulin secretion, other hormones, you know, bio rhythms, so it's a. everyone's different than that. Biodiversity is a very important consideration when you talking about any kind of diet, whether it's a Vegan diet, a vegetarian diet, ketogenic diet, everybody's body responds differently to different things, but what I'm saying about getting back to the case against sugar is we've got obese and diabetic because of the sugar and processed grains. The people who became obese and diabetic did so because of the sugar and the process grades and that sense, their bodies all responded the same regardless of what their geno type was. Right? And now when you want to get them back from the edge, that's where individual variation plays a role. I mean that guy mcdougall pushes to starch diet. He's got people on his website who swear that they lost a hundred pounds eating only potatoes. Don't you think though that a lot of people, when you start concentrating

Speaker 1:          02:13:32       on losing weight and concentrating on being healthy and concentrating on your di, you make a concerted effort sort of across the board. So if you just go, I'm only gonna eat sweet potatoes and you know, and like it just the very act of considering your diet and being conscientious has an effect.

Speaker 3:          02:13:49       Well, it has an effect in many ways. One of them is you do consistent things that there are consistent things that you don't do. So like make the logo, puts people on a starch diet and Atkins puts them on a ketogenic diet and ornish puts them on a 10 percent fat. Mostly vegetarian diet and nestled thien is, you know, a low carb diet and none of them, all of them say, don't eat sugar, don't drink soda. I don't drink fruit. Juices, don't eat white bread. And they don't do it for the same reason because it's good to stimulate insulin, you know, so. And then when they benefit, you don't know if they benefited because they didn't eat meat or they didn't eat gluten or they didn't eat sugar and white bread and you know, so the question then will become an even if the ones who benefited like under McDougall diet, the thing that makes me suspicious is the people we say, I tried Atkins and it didn't work for me. And is that that they really try it. They try it, lost 60 pounds and then went back to eating carbs and gained it back and said the Diet failed. Did they just find it too hard to live without their pastries? But once they make duke came along and put them on the potato diet or did he just tell him to say that because he wants to point out that this works for people that low carb does it and you just never know. Crazy. Crazy world.

Speaker 1:          02:15:13       Yeah. It's very hard to tell when you're dealing with anecdotal evidence. Right? It's very, very hard to tell when dealing with personal experiences about what someone says they did versus what they actually did.

Speaker 3:          02:15:22       Yeah. The one that's nobody knows. And one of the great flow, I mean there's tons of. We could talk about the flaws in nutrition research for another three hours. That'll be our next podcast. No, it's interesting because I'm doing this talk with you. I've never done it like two, three hour podcasts before and you're like still laser focused and I could imagine, I think I'm going to get in the ring with you. I could see it happening. That exact thing that we discussed earlier about that, you know, you need like five minutes of energy to overwhelm your opponent and I could see it happening here and I'm thinking, okay, if I didn't have a cold and I can breathe through my nose, I could take Joe, we could go for seven hours. I can wear them out and if it gets bad we'll take out the drugs and the Tequila and we'll see. You know how there he's probably got, you know, I, I gotta get back in shape there. But anyway, it's interesting. So packet drugs, it's been a long time. Well I got a certain, you know, establishment veneer that I got to present to the world. Understand responsible, I got to get people who wear jackets and ties and button down shirts from Brooks brothers to take me seriously. Believe me, as weird as it sounds, a lot of those fuckers are listening right now. That's good. And done it for awhile.

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       This is a really important subject and this is, wrap this up here because I just want to thank you very much for writing that book and taking the time to put it in that research, uh, against probably a lot of people's advice and my wife. Well her, it worked out in my, in laws overall. I mean it really is. You've made a substantial impact and like I said, at least a half a dozen people that I deeply respected recommended your work and I'm really glad I got a chance to sit down and talk about this and I think a lot of people are going to benefit from this podcast and this is one thing that's just sort of piling on top of a massive amount of data that's now available to people that lets them make better, better food choice.

Speaker 3:          02:17:10       Well, that's the one thing I was going to say is what's really been the trump trump card? He's out. What's really pushed, uh, you know, what's allows us to win. Okay. Which we couldn't win 50 years ago is he internet and that, and people can try these dive. Remember I said, yeah, we're dealt for aces. The fact as you go on these diets, it helps people. It helps them a lot, not everyone. And we got distracted in some people. I don't know, maybe some people just have bad reactions to cutting out all the carbs, but for most people, some significant proportion, they give up the carbs, they're healthier and then they can talk about on the Internet and they could share with people and they don't have to live in the same town or go to the same school. So the word gets out and then other people want to be helped.

Speaker 3:          02:17:58       And, you know, even with physicians, it's like I got these doctors saying you, you made medicine fund for me again because I can help people and that to get spread around the Internet and they, you know, you create clusters and facebook groups and it just, you create momentum and you break out of the gatekeepers. It's no longer, it's no longer just did I or did I not get into the medical journal? Was I influence enough to write this review. It's like, wait a minute, you said this, but look at what happened to my neighbor. I want that to happen to me. And so you get this kind of revolution. It's slow and it's takes time. And it, you know, there's a lot of resistance and the vegetarian community, they, they resist it because the implication is that a lot of people will be healthier for the Ada. Animals said to Michael Pollan's, you know, eat food not too much. Mostly plants and for the, uh, obese diabetic individuals in the country which represent virtually 50 percent of Americans, maybe. Mostly animals.

Speaker 1:          02:19:00       Well, I'm hoping though that with the, the. I mean, there's been some really significant breakthroughs over the last few years. We had factory produced meat that does not involve any animals dying, their initial meet from a dead animal and reproduce it in factories and I think we're probably just a couple of years away from mass production or something like that. You know, it's interesting. One of the things that were in Missouri, they're going to make low fat meat, right? Because I don't know. I mean maybe with, with what's going on right now and the understanding that people have versus what they

Speaker 4:          02:19:28       had only five or six years ago. I mean, I don't, I think there's probably going to be a market for high fat meat. I hope so. Well, I'm gonna wait for you to try it and telling that shows the benefit of being a hunter. So a kill my own meat is healthy as it gets. Yeah. But I, I sympathize. I, I completely understand where the vegetarians and the vegans can. I get it. I, I, and I admire them as. I really feel like anybody could eat, like naturally sourced eggs. Like I have chickens and they don't, they don't get harmed by me eating their eggs at all. They live a natural life and everything's fine. There was no cruelty involved whatsoever. And those eggs are extremely healthy and beneficial and that's some of the best, uh, emails I ever got were from Vegetarians who said, you know, I read your stuff.

Speaker 4:          02:20:14       I didn't want to like it. I thought I'm intellectually open. I'll read a couple of chapters, decide it's full of shit, and then I'll be able to close it. And much to my dismay, I found your argument compelling and some of them start eating, start eating meat again. Some just add eggs back to their diet, thanks to the shoulder and the crap and find that they're healthier and happier and they feel better. And that, that to me, when you don't convince, when you see somebody say, you know, hey, I, I get it. I do see your point. And I was, I can change. I feel like for people, eggs are the best compromise because you, you can easily digest them. It's very few issues whatsoever with that. And again, if you have a yard, you could have your own chickens. Well that's not only that you can make the, it's they're like quick, I mean, you could scramble for eggs in the morning and almost as much time as it takes to poor salary.

Speaker 4:          02:21:04       I went to a ball cap, so. Absolutely. Yeah. So it sounds like I don't have time to eat right. Um, they don't take a lot of work to be good. Some people, I mean, my oldest son, I can't get them to eat an egg unless it's gotten motsa mixed in and maple syrup port. I don't know what it is. Again, it's one of these things, it's like it's poison to them. But listen, Gary, thanks so much for being here. Really, really appreciate it. And I urge anyone listening to this to check out Gary's book, the case against sugar and anything else. No, that's it. Thank you joe. Thank you. Great. Really appreciate it. It's cool.
