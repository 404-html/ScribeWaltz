Speaker 1:          00:00:00       It's authentic. That's sweet. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:00:05       I'm just now getting over the hurricane of Shannon Briggs. It came through this with a storm of. Let's go champ. He's a maniac. He is a maniac. So, uh, I'm glad we can get you in here today because, uh, explained to everybody. First of all, people don't know Chris produced and what'd you direct it and produce it in a bigger, stronger, faster and prescription thugs and prescription thugs, which is particularly important because a lot of it was about the prescription industry and the, the how many people get hooked and you've had experience with it. I, we, we've all known people in the last. People that have had problems with prescription pills, but you want her to come in and talk about Kratom

Speaker 1:          00:00:44       sure. Yeah. You know, a while back when I was actually hooked on pills, I was looking for a way to get off of how it's searched the internet every day on a way to get clean and sober. And I came across this thing called Kratom and I said, are they sell it at these head shops and different things. And, you know, back then I wasn't really familiar with the head shop singing or anything like that. So I actually, um, I never found it. I never went out and sought it out. And then, um, after going through Rehab, I had heard about it a couple more times from some people I've heard about people taking it to get off of opiates. It's a plant, it's a, it's a 100 percent natural plant comes from, um, you know, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, that's where they grow it. It's been used for like 2000 years.

Speaker 1:          00:01:26       I'm basically, it works sort of like an opioid, but it's not a drug, it's just a plant, you know, and it has these properties that have helped people bridge the gap when they get off of opiates so they don't have withdrawals. What it also does is help relieve pain and it also helps with anxiety. It helps with, uh, you know, elevates your mood and it does all these great things. But the government now wants to make it a schedule one drug. But so you're saying it's not a drug though? Well, you know, that's, I guess it's semantics. It's like, how do you classify something that's been around for 2000 years? No one's ever done any studies on it being a drug and no one's ever done any studies on it. Well, there's been some, there's been actually a lot of studies on it being a supplement, but they aren't like these FDA approved double blind placebo studies that they're requiring for it to be on the market as a normal supplement.

Speaker 1:          00:02:14       But it, um, does it, uh, has psychoactive properties. Well, it'll, it'll elevate your mood. So would just talk about Alpha brain are some nootropics. It'll work like that and it will elevate your mood. I mean, I don't know where the real distinction is between high and elevation of mood or were, you know, what the difference is really there, but it doesn't make you feel like. It's not like I smoked pot. It's more like I had a good cup of coffee, you know, I'm fired up back in the day when it used to take pre workout supplements. Caffeine and ephedrine kind of feels like that. I just feel like fired up and ready to go and I don't feel pain.

Speaker 2:          00:02:49       That's interesting to create them, gets you fired up. I would've never, I would've thought it would've melted you out. I have zero experience or that you have some here now and you could drive in this stuff is

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       that they tell you not to operate heavy, heavy machinery and things like that. But I've never had a problem with it. I actually take it to drive. So you know, tomorrow I'm leaving for Thanksgiving. I had to drive six hours. So that's your ass. I'm taking Kratom before I get in the car to go because it actually helps me focus. It relieves the pain. Wow. That's, that sounds crazy. So it, it, it mimics the effects of opioids, right? Opiates. But it also elevates you. Well sure. So like if you don't know if you've ever taken oxycotton or a vicodin or any of those things like that. A lot of times when people take that, they feel like, you know, they're indestructible. I took violin and I think it was viking in once when I had my first knee surgery in [inaudible] 93. I fucking hated it.

Speaker 3:          00:03:47       I took, I took it literally one time and I guess for me, you know, I guess it's different for everybody. I think it was vodka didn't, it might've been percosets, but whatever the doctor gave me for pain, I took the pills. I was like, oh my God, I feel so fucking stupid. I'm like, I'd rather be in pain that field as dumb. Sure. I think a lot of times, like what happened with me is I came out of anesthesia from a surgery and I was all doped up on the drugs and I didn't even know it, so it just kinda like, just kept going, you know what I mean? Like I never, I never stopped getting high from the time I was in the hospital for like six years. So, um, for me it was like, you know, opiates were real big problem. They were ruining my life.

Speaker 3:          00:04:23       They were destroying me. Now that I got sober a two and a half years ago and I started taking Kratom I feel great. Like everything in my entire career is going skyrocketing, things are going great. I relationship, my girlfriend's great, just everything's been been good so I can't really see the badness. So when they decided to make this a schedule, one drug, we decided to make a documentary about it and show the world what it, what it really is. That seems really bizarre that you would have a problem with drugs and then this would help you. Like I would think that if you have a problem with drugs you would want to stay away from anything that's sketchy. Sure. But a big part of addiction you got to remember is that we relapse relapse if you can have something. It actually helps with alcohol withdrawals and alcohol cravings.

Speaker 3:          00:05:06       So if we have something that will help me to not crave those things or even think about them and also not feel pain. Like why should I have to be in pain? Like there's no, you know, no. You in pain right now? Not right now because I took them before I came here, but I would normally be in a lot of arthritic pain. Okay. Just and you have arthritis just naturally, right? Double. Yeah. Double hip replacement surgery. I need both of my knees done, my shoulder shot, you know, kinda everything. I'm kind of pretty beat up and so for me it just works. You know, my brother who was also a power lifter, he takes it as well before he trains and he really loves it too. It takes it before he lifts weights. Yeah. Wow. And he's trying to bench 600 pounds so he's not like, it's not like he's using a little bit of weight.

Speaker 3:          00:05:49       He's your brother's a gorilla and he's pushing it. That's, that's so strange to me. And this is all like, I'm glad we didn't talk before this podcast because I had a thought in my head of what this stuff is. And you changing it right now. I, you think it was. Well, I felt like it was probably just a good way that people could relieve pain naturally, but I felt like if someone was going to describe it to me, I thought they were going to tell me about an opiate type of effect. That it just mellows you out, but it doesn't, it doesn't hurt you. There are different strains of it. There's a strain called Bali, which is supposed to be good for anxiety and kind of calm you down. There's a strand called green melee, which is like sort of get. That's the one that is a good pre workout, but they're all kind of the same thing.

Speaker 3:          00:06:30       You know, they all have the same alkaloids. Kratom has 27 alkaloids. So when you look at it, it actually has alkaloids that worked like opiate stay attached to opiate receptors, but not in the same way. If you look at oxycotton when it attaches, they went opiate receptor. I mean it's like, you know, it's stuck in there. It's like screwed in basically if you think about like a screw and opiate recite screwed in there so tight that you could never just pull it out, you'd have to unscrew. So with um, with, with the Kratom though, it kind of like balance, it Kinda like drifts around the top of that opiate receptor. It doesn't, it doesn't attach it nearly as hard. They say that opiates attach a thousand times greater to the opiate receptor than anything found in nature and Kratom's found in nature. Oh Wow. But what about heroin?

Speaker 3:          00:07:15       Like the actual poppy seed is found in nature, right? So, and they have to do stuff to it to make it, you know, heroin. They have to do stuff with a coca leaves to make cocaine. They have to, you know, it's like marijuana and Kratom are probably the two most similar things. And when I went to, uh, interview, uh, Senator Mark Pocan last week about a, he was the one that wrote a letter to the government. He wants to keep Kratom legal. He thinks that, you know, it should be allowed for everyone. And I said to him, what do you think about marijuana? And he was like, I just think it should all be legal. And it was the first time I was ever in the presence of somebody that works for the government saying that they think that weed and Kratom and all this stuff should be illegal.

Speaker 3:          00:07:53       And it's because he had a good head on his shoulders about the problems that people face every day. You know, it's not black and white. Like I live in this gray area. I don't, I'm in a lot of pain. But I don't want to take opiates and I shouldn't have to take opiates. So where's the pressure coming from to turn this stuff into a schedule one drug if there's no. If there's no negative response by the body, you're not having people die of overdoses. Is there an ld 50 rate on this stuff? Well, if you look at, you know where, where is the ld 50 explained. Probably explained to people lethal dose at 50 percent. Meaning if you take 50 rats and you give them a pound of this shit, 50 of them are 25 die at a certain show. We've heard about, you know, there's been no deaths from marijuana, right? Freedom is the same thing. No, no deaths. There have been zero deaths and there, there have actually been 15 deaths that have been brought to the FDA and the dea is attention. Those 15 that's. I actually went and interviewed one of the. One of the mothers. The kid was on three psych meds. He was withdrawn. He was

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       honored withdrawing from three different psych meds. I have a black box warning that says, warning, if you're a teenager, you might commit suicide basically, and this kid committed suicide. He didn't die from a Kratom overdose. He died from committing suicide and his mother wants to blame Kratom. She doesn't think that the, uh, the psych meds had anything to do with it. And I don't want to say that Kratom had nothing to do with it. We don't really know. And what I really call for with Kratom is just more research, like I want people to put in the money to do the research to make sure that this is safe and let's see if we can solve this opiod epidemic. Let's see if we can crack down, you know, basically lower the amount of opiate prescriptions we have in this country. I just read an article the other day.

Speaker 1:          00:09:37       One in seven people in America are going to be affected with addiction problems. Wow, that's crazy. One in seven. That means somebody in your family, that's, that's insane. Somebody in your family will be affected by it and that's 10 percent. Yeah, that's weird. That's weird, right? And not everybody is. It's not that everybody gets addicted that are affected by addiction. My girlfriend was really affected by addiction because when she met me, I was taking drugs and drinking every day. And um, that's a, that's a big effect on, especially on women. It's tough. It's tough thing to handle. Now I can understand this woman whose son died being to understand her remorse and looking to point the blame at someone. And a lot of times people are reluctant to point the blame towards something that a doctor prescribed and they'll automatically say, well, it probably wasn't that.

Speaker 1:          00:10:27       It was probably this other thing that's not regulated. You know what she said to me? She said, Chris, I'm going to pray for you because I know you're taking Kratom and I'm going to pray for you that you're okay. And I was like, you know, lady, you don't need to pray for me. Like I've been taking it for a year, you know? And I think that people just get it wrong and I feel bad for her. I feel bad for her. And the fact that, um, that she can't just realize that, you know, she can't look at the research and see, you know, because when I went and interviewed her, she said, well, I'm not even sure if Kratom killed them and this is after a gigantic, you know, uh, they, they, they mount this gigantic media coverage of this story, right? Like this was all over and now and now, like two years later after the damage has been done, she's kind of coming back and say, well, I don't know if it was Kratom, you know, she already did the damage like that.

Speaker 1:          00:11:13       These are, these deaths are the reason why the dea wants to ban it. Well, the dea though is going on. What kind of effort? I mean, when they do a scientific analysis of creative and they break it down, they find they don't find anything toxic in it. Do they know? Well, I talked to Melvin Patterson, he's the spokesman for the, for the dea. And when I talked to Melvin Patterson, what he told me is that they lean on the FDA a lot for these kinds of decisions. Right? So they go to the FDA and they asked the FDA, can you give us an eight point? It's like some sort of a thing that they have in place. It's like an eight point inspection to make sure that this drug is not dangerous, you know, and if it is dangerous, it's deemed dangerous, they'll take it off the market based on the FDA's research.

Speaker 1:          00:11:53       So the dea had asked the FDA for that eight point inspection, the FDA never went ahead and did it. So the DEA got upset and said, well, we're gonna abandon any way because we're waiting on you guys. And then there was a big uproar. There was 100,000 people signed a petition partly due to to you tweeting about it and things like that. It was a Guy Andrew Turner, he tweeted you. He was an Iraq war vet. And um, you should see his video. He can't even speak without Kratom. He cannot talk normal without Kratom. He speaks with all these ticks and twitches in his face due to they think maybe ptsd and some other problems that had affected him. And now he takes Kratom. And those twitches all go away. He did a video on youtube that was kind of amazing. He stopped taking it for six days and you can see all these twitches are evidence and then he goes back on the Kratom and they all disappeared.

Speaker 1:          00:12:42       Wow. Wow. So who's pressuring the dea to turn this stuff into a schedule one drug. And why schedule one? There is a, there's a couple of patents that are on the alkaloids that are in the plant. So I think that big Pharma would be the first place to look. They have a couple patents. They want to basically take this, you know, I think it's actually, I, I don't, I don't look at it as being that bad, but why make, why make the organic kratom illegal in order to turn this into a more powerful drug? They think that they can extract some of these alkaloids, right? There's two alkaloids, metallothionein, and the other one is like seven hydroxy metallothionein. It's too technical for anybody to really care about, but there's two alkaloids that they really care about that help with opiate withdrawals and help with pain.

Speaker 1:          00:13:32       And those are the two, and actually just want to ban the two alkaloids, but you can't do that because it's in the plant. So you have to ban the whole plant. And to me, you know, you said it the best. He said making something else illegal. It's like archaic. It doesn't make any sense. What are you going to do to the people? You know, five states just legalized marijuana. Now you're going to throw people in jail for Kratom. It doesn't make sense. Well, I'm worried about this new administration when it comes to men may various reasons, but I'm worried about them when it comes to being compromised by big Pharma. I really am. You know, it's just a such a business oriented administration and he's bringing all these old dudes over there right out of the TV show. The strain, like the vampire dudes that are hanging out with the Nazis.

Speaker 1:          00:14:12       Like I'm looking at all these people like Mike Pence and all these old dudes. He's bringing in with these archaic ideas. They're all against gay marriage. I mean, it's ridiculous. You know, I was hoping that maybe trump would bring in some people that would be opposite of his thinking and you know, it just hasn't happened. So he was a Democrat for a long time. I mean Donald Trump was always a democrat. I mean him running as a Republican is kind of odd if you look at this history, but he's going all in with a lot of these people in. Some of them are deeply opposed to marijuana legalization federally and know that stuff is very counterintuitive and counter progressive and the marijuana legalization, we've been reading a lot about that and it's going to be what a lot of people think might be a mess because we're making it recreational opens it up to Marlborough and all these other companies that make tobacco products to now start selling cannabis and a turn it into what we already have.

Speaker 1:          00:15:06       Bullshit. Well, I'm not opposed to them making it commercial because I feel like the more people do it, the better we're all going to be sure. I really, I really believe that. I mean, people say, Oh, your upload who'd brew, but I really think it's a it. I think, I mean you can call it a drug, but whatever it is, it is a component of life that makes people calmer, makes people happier. It makes people more sensitive. I just think it's better for people. I was 100 percent against it ever since I was in college. Like I had just thought like a marijuana. Wow, that's. So, that's the worst thing, you know, and, and steroids. I thought marijuana, steroids were the, were the devil and come to find out it's all the drugs that the doctors actually prescribe us that are the devil that we need to look out for.

Speaker 1:          00:15:46       You know, they're not necessarily to say the devil. They help a lot of people, but we have to be very careful about what we're putting in our bodies that our doctors give us. We can't just say, well, the doctor said it's fine and just take it. And that's how I got addicted to opiates. And a lot of people want to say, I'll get it on instagram all the time. Well Bro, it's your fault, man. It's all your fault and they know nothing about addiction. It's not my fault. It's not anybody's fault. These things happen because it's a progressive, you know, these drugs were designed to make you addicted, so to say, it's my fault. It's kind of ridiculous because the drug was actually designed so people get hooked on it. Yeah, you just didn't outrun it. That's all it is. I did not run it.

Speaker 1:          00:16:21       Yeah, I mean that's really what it is. It's like some people out run it and you get away from it. You should have been stronger brew. All right. How many people have to get fucking addicted before you recognize that it's a problem instead of the giant problem in this country? We lose a person to addiction every 19 minutes in this country. Accidental overdoses. I think I've said that several times on your show and it's just, you can't say it enough. You know, we have this giant opiod epidemic and we have something here, you know, in, in our film, we're just, we're starting to make a documentary about this and in the film, you know, we show a guy who has a, not a, not a huge habit, but six vicodin a day habit and he cuts that down to zero using Kratom and we watched that, you know, that process because I feel like that's important to show that like, Hey, you can actually do this now if we have people that are really, really addicted to heroin and really, really addicted to these other drugs, they might need something like suboxone.

Speaker 1:          00:17:13       And then Kratom, you know, like we don't really, we don't really know. You know, my friend Kelly done, who owns the company, uh, urban ice that we were just, we were just talking to, he actually bought a farm up in Washington and it's his intent if people don't have money to go to rehab or do whatever they can come up and visit him, you know, and get Kratom he's actually a licensed therapists and all that stuff like that. So like, I feel like it's sort of this, this grassroots movement to um, to try to get people to even try Kratom. That's what I've been trying to do is get people like, hey, this, just try it. Like you said with marijuana. The more people that try it, the better off we'll be. And I really feel that with Kratom to making me want to try it now.

Speaker 1:          00:17:53       What is the name up Kratom plant? Like what does the plant look like? It's a plant. It kind of looks like, I don't know, like a poison ivy plant. I'm sure he can maybe pull one up, you know, but it basically just looks like just like any other plant, shiny green leaves. And I don't think I even heard about it until maybe a couple of years ago and I didn't know how to pronounce it until a month ago while people say Kratom Kratom, tomato, tomato, whatever. I didn't. I mean I've rarely heard of. I think someone gave me some after a show, one day I'm more wrong, you know, what that looks like or it goes, it kind of happens a lot. Like somebody will say, hey here, try this, and I, I never trust that either, but for me what happened to me is very interesting. I have a lot of friends in this, you know, in this world of fitness and whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:18:35       And so I just ended up talking to a lot of people that try a lot of different things. So after I got done with the opiates, I was on Dr drew show and he said, well you should try advil and tylenol and combination that's going to be better than an opiate for your pain, for your chronic pain. So I said, okay. I started trying that. Then I get a phone call from my friend who's lives in England who tells me he just had a kidney transplant because of all the insights he was taken. So now he doesn't. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatories which are advil. Sure. Yeah. Advil and tylenol. So that. So he had a kidney transplant. I just thought, you know, I didn't think that that was going to necessarily happen to me, but I was taking like 10 advil a day, you know, that could happen.

Speaker 1:          00:19:12       Then how many will your friend tig? And he said about 20 and he was in new Bain addict before that, so he doesn't know if it's a new Bain. Right. Blah, blah blah. Right. So you're getting all these problems. I just thought like, well look, taking 10 advil and tylenol a day because I was taking them in combination. That just can't be good for your campaign. So my friend Kelly hit me up. He's like, hey man, you should try this plant. It might help you. And what was your first experience with. My first experience was um, so my friend Kelly was a very serious about this and he wants to help a lot of people. He said I'll fly to Sacramento. I was living up by my brother at the time. So he flew out to Sacramento to see me. He gave me some Kratom.

Speaker 1:          00:19:47       He went to his hotel. I went to my house. I had just been filming with my brother for like five hours straight. And my arthritis was like, at its worst point, like the worst it could possibly be. Is that from standing? Standing up? Yeah. Yeah. Just get beat up, you know, and I'm also standing on concrete floors and gyms and stuff like that, so I was just like, beat up. I took the Kratom and then he came over later that day to talk to me and I said, dude, you're not going to believe it, but I'm in. No, I don't feel any pain right now. No pain. And it took a good two or three months for me to really get into it because like I might tell you now and you might go home and try this, right? Right. Anybody say, yeah, Chris, whatever the fuck like that, that doesn't work, but then for some reason you'll go back to it and then he'd go back to it and go back to it and all of a sudden like it's a miracle. You. I don't know what. That's how. That's how it was for me. I'm not saying that's how it's gonna be for everyone. Well, I'm not in any pain, so if I took it, it was just to get fucked up. Well, elevate your mood to elevate my mood. I'm pretty happy right now. I don't want to get more elevated. I'll do something silly. Yeah, you might. You never know, but also helps with that lowers your blood pressure.

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       It helps with anxiety, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Right. So you can look at it for several health band, but it doesn't get you to a point where you can't drive or you don't know how to type. I should probably get responsible and say it hasn't gotten me to that point. Hasn't gotten you to that, but I have. I have taken too much of it. Oh, okay. Give me one of them packets and tell me like how much you're supposed to take. Well, if it's all gonna be relative, right? You would take one of these. What do you weight? One Ninety, 200? Yeah, somewhere in the range of 200, so 200. So I take six of them that I worked up to six of them pills. Yeah. I would say this is a packet of pills. Sure. Now now crate, I'm a lot of times it's taken in a powder form but it tastes disgusting so I can't handle the powder so I just take the capsules.

Speaker 3:          00:21:32       Yeah, somebody gave me an a powder form and I'm just like, heroin. You don't want to hear something really interesting. I, I was supposed to speak at an AA meeting the other day and um, I got a phone call from, from somebody at the AA. If I took some right now. How much should I take? I take two. Okay. But you know, like, um, I was supposed to speak at an AA meeting and I got a phone call from a good friend of mine and she said, well, I'm confused now because I'm not sure if you're sober. Oh, because you're taking Kratom I'm taking Kratom and it affects your mind. So now I need to worry that you're fucking up. They're worried that I'm fucking up and it, you know what, it actually hurt me. Like it hurt. It hurt to hear that from somebody that like helped me get sober.

Speaker 3:          00:22:12       It really hurt my feelings. Like, I don't mean to sound like a pussy, but like hurt my feelings to hear like, Hey, you're not sober from people. I really looked up to him and I can understand their worry. I totally understand. There I, it's so confused. It sounds like you're doing a heroin substitute. Sure. Natural heroin substance and it's been called, you know, herbal heroin. So I can, I can see their concern. So is that maybe the same sort of concern that led the dea to take a close look at this? Because I mean if you look at it, I mean everyone wants to worry that the dea is in bed with big Pharma and it's all about business and they're really here to screw over the American people. Keep these legal, natural things away from us. But I had the same sort of reservations.

Speaker 3:          00:22:53       Man. I didn't know until you came in here today. I didn't know that you could operate cars on it and it doesn't fuck with you and that you take it before a drive. Like I would've never imagined that I, I do want to stay in the area, but I don't want to be here and be irresponsible. I don't think every. I don't want to say, oh, everybody should take credit. I mean everybody, you know, but I feel like I feel like I know that it's safe enough to try. For example, I know it's safe enough for anybody to, to try. So I've seen it. I've seen any in thousands of people that are, that are using it. I get emails everyday from people that take Kratom because we're doing a documentary and you know as well, you know, when I feel that media has the power to change your world, I feel like what you do, what I do, we actually have a voice and we have a power that can change people's minds.

Speaker 3:          00:23:36       My film bigger, stronger, faster, completely changed people's minds on steroids. It did, it changed my mind. It gave me a view into it that I'd never before and that. And then there was a. was it an hbo real sports did a whole thing on steroids. Real sports. Yeah. Sports. And they were essentially saying, where's the body's like? Everyone's talking about people dying from steroid overdoses. No, it's not what's happening? They're dying from pain pills. I didn't get to tell you how I turned around on marijuana. Oh, the Joe Rogan experience listening to the show, you know, that's why I said media is important. I feel like it's. We can change the world. We can change things. I was dead set against it, thought it was for losers. I'm like, oh, Joe Rogan smokes pot. Maybe it's not so bad. So I started doing the research. I'm not saying I just jumped in and started doing it, but I've done the research and I know enough that it's.

Speaker 3:          00:24:26       That it's safe. You know, we know it's 100 percent safe. I mean, you could definitely take too much of it. Just like you were saying, you could take too much kratom. You can get too fucking high and freak out. That's true. But if just get a little bit high, you're gonna be all right. Ma. Marijuana and Kratom or both. They're both miracle plants. They're both plants that are put here. I, you know, if you believe in God, I believe that, you know, these things were put here on the planet for us to use, to heal ourselves, to feel better. There's nothing wrong with feeling better. I think we have a big aversion in this country to people being able to feel better. Like anything, you know, I don't know, taking Kratom I'll. It makes you feel better. Like why is that a crime? It shouldn't be fine.

Speaker 3:          00:25:02       And she'd be, you know, we have alcohol on the market that makes people feel better. We have cigarettes and tobacco and that makes people feel better and they get a little buzz from it or whatever. Why not Kratom like what's the big deal? Yeah. We have a reluctance to indulgence in some ways, right? Like we're worried about indulging in something, something pleasurable, like it's bad for you. Well, people say, oh, Kratom, I heard that makes you high. And I'm like, well first of all, what would it be wrong? What would be so bad with that? That's a good feeling for a lot of people. I don't, I don't see that that's so bad to have a little bit of euphoria, you know, now being high on cocaine or crack or whatever. That's a completely different story. We're not talking about that. We're just talking about like a little elevation in your mood.

Speaker 3:          00:25:43       Yeah. There's a big difference between being high and being impaired short, right? I think we, we put those two together and they're always in the same category for some strange reason and they don't necessarily have to be like a nice cup of coffee gets you high. Yeah, I made it. Look, I drink a cup of coffee in the morning and I start slap my hands together and I want to start doing shit. You know, if I drank that little caveman coffee, sure I'd be bouncing off the walls because that's so strong and it's. I don't think there's anything wrong with it. I love it. I think it should be legal and I think that you know of Kratom is in the same league as coffee and starbucks is the biggest business in our country. Like why? Why is it so bad? So since the people like people that are sober and then are helping you with that, they have concerns about it and there's a lot of people that are going to. It seems like this is a drug or a plant I should say, that just does not have enough. There's not enough data, there's not enough research, not enough research. And that's what we want to do. We would like, you know, look, every time there's been an epidemic in this country, we had a polio outbreak, right? And our president was affected by it.

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       So what did we do? We decided, you know what? No more polio. Let's fix the problem. I don't see why the government doesn't say, look, we're losing a person every 19 minutes. This is way more serious than polio. Why are we not putting funding into researching things like Kratom? There's other things that are like Kratom to why aren't we researching these things? There's another plant called Aka Uma and other plant called soursop. There's several plants that are, that are like Kratom and do they do similar things? Why can't we study those to stop the deaths, to like slow it down, you know, to, to make a dent and the deaths from opiod addiction. There's no reason why the government can't fund that. Now. What are these other plants, Aka Uma and what was the other one? One's called Aka Uma and one's called soursop. And the reason why even know about those is because what happens as soon as something gets banned, you look for the next thing, right?

Speaker 1:          00:27:33       Oh Wow. So you're a step ahead. I don't even know what those things do, but I know we like as soon as, uh, Kratom was band, we were on the Internet looking for like, well, what else is like it because I don't want to have to deal without it. Well, I think it was you that tweeted something and um, I might retweet it or just read it, but you tweeted something about someone getting arrested, like some big drug bust where they busted him for Creighton, which wasn't even illegal. Yeah, that's that, that's a weird thing. That was a guy I think, um, maybe because that, that, that guy's neighbor has had it out for them, they sorta like had it out for them and they saw these big green bags of what they thought was drugs at his house and the cops went to write it and they're like, well, we're not sure what this is, so we're going to have to arrest you.

Speaker 1:          00:28:14       Oh God. You know what I mean? It took causes like a pretty, pretty weird problem. You know, the thing was when they made it illegal, I had two giant boxes of Kratom sitting in my garage and all I could think about was like, okay, the cops are going to come here and they're going to bust me because they know I'm doing a documentary about it. I'm going to be, you know, the mark man. But I decided that like no matter what happened, I was going to keep those boxes in my garage and I wasn't gonna worry about it because I figured like, what are they going to come arrest me? You know, how stupid that would look because that's all going into the documentary. So I don't really have a fear that other people have because I feel like I put everything on camera and put everything out there.

Speaker 1:          00:28:51       So I feel like. But uh, but other people, it is serious, like the um, the vet I was talking about, he can't live without Kratom. What are we going to do? Take it away from him. What are we going to do in the meantime? You know, if we, if we ban it, what are we going to do? What are we going to do with that guy? Yeah. Like where's she going to go back on opiates to the VA hospital. Like it's fuck what a weird situation. So we really need you. Chris Documentary is actually important. Yeah, it's very, very important. It's very important because it's not just about Kratom is about how the Dea and the FDA protect the interest of our federal government and they keep the money all in the pool to themselves and they don't want anybody else in. And I feel like it's just greed.

Speaker 1:          00:29:35       It's total greed. It's not. Has nothing to do with it being dangerous. Well, we're definitely more aware of that kind of and those kinds of compromises where these companies compromise various branches of the government for their own personal interest. And this Kratom is a perfect example of that because so many people including me know almost nothing about it. This is a weird one. You know, this is one where they almost got in like before people could understand what, what exactly it was, which is rare in 2016. There's something like that available. They've never had anything like this. The Dea has never seen a reply like this. There was 100,000 people that signed a petition, but one thing that I need to get out there to everybody, one, the one way we can keep this legal and keep other things legal as well is everybody needs to go to a website that the dea is set up.

Speaker 1:          00:30:24       It's called Kratom comments.org. So just Kra tlm comments.org. You can go there and you can leave, you know, up to 5,000 word message. You know about Kratom and it doesn't have to be from somebody who takes it. Like you could just be like, hey, I think this should, I watched it, this podcast and I, I really feel this needs to be researched more and you know, whatever, whatever you feel needs to be said. You can just say it here. So you know, like I went on and I left a comment about why I use it and what I like about it and I feel like everybody that does needs to do that or they're not doing their job. And what does that put that back up again? Jamie, please. It says December 20, first December, first deadline. Submit your comments now what is the deadline?

Speaker 1:          00:31:07       Well, that's why. That's why I was a pain in the ass and kept texting you because I was like, dude, can we get on before this deadline? Well, it's very important that people know that there's a deadline for these comments and it's in a couple days. It's December first and if you make a comment by December first, the dea has to read it like they have to look at it. So even if you write a bunch of Jibberish they have to read it, which is kind of funny now. But don't, don't do that though folks. They'll go, he's on Kratom and Kenny can't spell. No, but I'm saying they have to. They have to look at all of them. So if we can get 10,000 comments, I think there's maybe half that right now. And your show is so powerful. If we can get 10,000 comments then this is going to stay legal.

Speaker 1:          00:31:44       Wow. So it was supposed to be scheduled one. They had a plan to make a schedule one a while ago. Very interesting. The dea only has one option. The only. The DEA has an emergency scheduling. So there was a drug called [inaudible]. Have you ever heard of flocker? No. Jamie can you look up Flocka Fla kkr because you have to see this. Flocka was a drug in Florida where everybody was going crazy. They were like smashing shit and like they were like smashing through their car windows and jumping on cars and they were like zombies and that got banned like immediately and nobody. There was no, like there was nobody that stuck up know produce killer drug. Yeah. Well that was something. So you made him crazy. Yeah. Anyway. Well you see like what some of these people do like paypal, God that goes on there on Flakka is that real? But see what happens is, I don't know, I don't know. It's a synthetic drug, so I think Kratom gets lumped in with these synthetic drugs like spice and Flocka that are like, watch this guy jumps into the back of the car. Oh my God. Jesus Christ. Yeah. See, like what the fuck this is someone on Flocka. Holy Shit. Can you imagine that's like that. That's like that movie it goes flying off the car back into the car. It's amazing. Whoa.

Speaker 1:          00:33:01       What the fuck? Why am I not getting this guy smashing? You know? Oh my God, that's like the most entertaining video I've ever seen. So even if it's not real, I love it, but I think it was a drug that they were selling in head shops down in Florida and it got banned within like, I dunno, a couple months of it being always fucking Florida guys always handled Florida. The gateway to demonic possession. I was saying that seems like that's like I am legend. Like they'll fucking crazy things from the will smith movie monsters. Yeah. So this guy jumped on this guy's hood and he's trying to shake them off. Is that what happened? What I'm saying is that when we sell things, you know, things that they sell in, in head shops like old spice members, spice was a synthetic marijuana. And the problem with it is that, um, a lot of times they're unregulated.

Speaker 1:          00:33:47       Like nobody know that spice just came on the market. There was no regulation. They were selling in head shops. They were getting away for like, I think everybody puts this stuff on the market to get away with it. But when Kratom was put it on the market, it wasn't put on the market to get away with it. You know, it, it's been in like, the problem is like there's a, there's a law in America called the act. Have you heard of that? It's a to Shay is basically the dietary supplement health something act, right? I forget. But basically what it does is anything that was on the market before 1994 gets grandfathered in and is illegal supplement. So like even if they didn't do the research on it or whatever before 1994. And that's something that Orrin hatch put in place to kind of keep the supplement industry, you know, it helped to supplement companies.

Speaker 1:          00:34:29       It doesn't help us as a consumer because we don't know what we're getting because there's no regulation. But um, but I feel like that, you know, that the Shea Act says if there was a supplement on the market before 1994, um, that it needs to stay legal and flow and um, Kratom has been sold in Florida. They've been selling it for 30 years. You know, they've been selling it before 1994. So I'm actually just trying, I'm, I'm actually went to the freedom of Information Act and summons the records we saw in the records for importation of Kratom. Now if we can prove that Kratom's been imported to the United States before 1994, we have a pretty solid case to say, you know, look, this gets grandfathered in just like everything else. Wow. So we grandfathered in as a nutritional supplement. I don't know. I mean it's, I'm sure they're gonna make it harder than that, you know, I'm sure like if we have the proof, but I'm just going at at full blast, you know, I feel like if you go out something with everything you got and he, and you look down every avenue, you're going to find something.

Speaker 1:          00:35:23       You know, it's kind of like a, I feel like a lawyer right now. Wow. What a strange predicament. But it's very unusual that there's something that's this well loved by the people that are taking it. But so little is known about it by most people, including me. I have to say something that's very important. The people that are against Kratom are just against the fact that they don't know a lot about it there. There's very few people that are like really dead set against it. There's a congresswoman down in Florida who's dead set against it because they want to boost their election. They want, they want people to vote for them, so they say, oh, we took this off the street. We saved your children, and like she doesn't really know nothing about Kratom like to make it illegal. What has she said about it?

Speaker 1:          00:36:02       Does she? She said, she told me, this is great. You didn't interview her. I interviewed her down in Florida and she told me that, you know, look, when you talk to a mother who, whose baby was born addicted to Kratom, she's like, that's going to change you. And I said, can you get me that mother's name, address and phone numbers so we can contact her a? Yeah, yeah, sure. We'll get around to it. They've never produced that. We've asked them for aiming. There really was a mother who was addicted to them. We've asked three or four times and we haven't gotten it however, however I did an interview, a girl in Washington dc who said that her baby was born, she was born, her baby was born addicted to opiates and that was a terrible, terrible thing that she had to go through and um, and now she takes Kratom and she's fine and she's not going to relapse and she'll be fine and her daughter ended up being fine and stuff like that.

Speaker 1:          00:36:50       So what I'm saying is like these opiates or what people will be born addicted to Kratom, you know, they're looking down the wrong. They're looking down the wrong rabbit hole, you know, like, you know. So does Kratom have any potential addictive side effects? Is that we don't know. It's hard to tell. You know, I, I, I can give you. How often do you take it? I take it usually every day, but I can give you some anecdotal evidence that I went to Thailand for two weeks a couple months ago and I had been taking Kratom for four months straight. Then I had a two week in Thailand. We were actually shooting a kickboxer movie and after, uh, after I got back from Thailand, uh, I wasn't, I wasn't Jonesing for Kratom like I, I didn't take it for two weeks because it's illegal there. So there was a reason it is illegal there.

Speaker 1:          00:37:34       Yeah. Like the last, like I've never been to Thailand and last thing I want to do is show up to Thailand and end up in Thai prison. Yeah. That doesn't sound fun now. It doesn't sound fun at all. So I was like, you know, I was like maybe maybe they don't even take this seriously there and maybe it's bullshit, but I'm not bringing it. But it is illegal over there. Uh, yeah, it's illegal in Thailand, you know, why it's illegal in Thailand. This is like, it's really interesting because we looked at, this is what they call it. It's like a kind of a tie, a tie name. But the reason why it's illegal in Thailand is because it was cutting into the opium profits. Oh Jesus. So what happens is people probably exactly the same pressure over here. Exactly. So hills just happened in the forties, 1942 or three.

Speaker 1:          00:38:16       They a ban Kratom and they wanted it. They basically kept it illegal because it was cutting into the money. The people, people were taking it instead of opium instead of heroin. Wow. And that's the same thing that's gonna happen in this country, but it's going to be different in this country. It's going to solve a problem. You know, is, is opium legal and Thailand, I don't think it's illegal, but like I think even, you know, it's like they just try to get it gay Kratom Kratom out so that nobody was taking it. Oh, I understand. So the people that were profiting off of freedoms more illegal than opium, if that makes sense. That's hilarious. Wow.

Speaker 1:          00:38:55       What a weird rabbit hole this is. Yeah. The whole, you know, to me the whole thing is interesting because I completely get the other side. I don't want anybody taking something that's unsafe. I don't want to market something that's unsafe, but I don't make a dime from selling Kratom. Like, that's not right. You're not selling it. That's not where my income comes from. And I'm not going to sell it, so it's like, it's not something where I'm like, hey man, I can make billions of dollars off this. Let me just go. Not only that, if anybody would have a an interest in not promoting something that's addictive, it would be a guy like you as an intimate knowledge of what it's like to be addictive and under the spell. Sure. I think addiction needs to be looked at in a certain way though, where you look at addiction and you go like, okay, I'm addicted to coffee.

Speaker 1:          00:39:35       It's no big deal. You know, like what is that going to? What is, what's the problem? What's the problem being like people are addicted to coffee. What's right. There really is no problem. Addicted to coffee, addicted to sugar will lead to problems down the road. But not a problem today. Addicted to cigarettes, lead to problems down the road, but not a problem today. You know? So we don't really know. There's not any long term studies to show that Kratom is good in the long term. There's not any interest studies, but we can go by the evidence that we do have, you know, and they've done a lot of studies in mice and all the studies and in mice, like none of the mice die, you know, they're not the. And, and the number one opiate addiction study they did was at a university of all, it's all miss whatever that Mississippi.

Speaker 1:          00:40:17       So Ole Miss, um, Christopher mccurdy, he's a guy that are doing the research and he really feels that this could be the savior for the opiod epidemic. He feels that they need to make it stronger. He feels they need to extract it, make it stronger and that would be used for the opiate epidemic. So that's why I said I think there is potential for it to be studied as both a dietary supplement and as a drug, because if you can, if you can make something out of Kratom that's gonna help a lot of people, you know, it's like, what's the big. I don't really see it as a big problem if, if it could be both. Right. You know what I mean? Like let them make their money and whatever, but keep it legal for us. So in doing your documentary, what have you, what have you learned about the push to try to make it illegal?

Speaker 1:          00:40:58       And when, when did it all start? It all started I think, um, shoot. When did it start? Started? Like over the summer. I actually started doing the documentary a little bit before it. I was like, well maybe if people she should know about this, maybe this is something. So you were doing it just to let people know about it. And then along the way it started to be threatened. He was weird. It was like I started doing it going like, is this going to be a movie or is this more like an infomercial? Like what is, what is this going to be, you know, like I don't, I don't want it to be like an infomercial because I'm not selling it and making money off of it. I want it to be something that's very honest about what product does.

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       And so to me, the ban and the controversy is the best thing that could ever happen because now people know about it and they're aware as long as it doesn't get banned, we're okay. You have a knack for that. You know, we think about it like in prescription thugs, you're making this documentary on pill addiction and then you get hurt during the middle of it, started taking pills and become addicted to pills during the middle of a documentary on pill addiction. How many there are blessed or cursed? I don't know. I don't know what that is. You know, you. You might fucking manifested or something, man. I hope not because actually the next documentary is about cancer. Oh, well the reason I'm doing that, the reason I do all my documentaries is because, like I said, we have the power to change the way people think and we have the power to open up people's minds about things that they might not know about well and also explore things.

Speaker 3:          00:42:20       You're very good at exploring things in a very objective way, in a very honest way. And I think that that's so important in today's day and age because it's so hard to know where, why a person's promoting something in one way or not promoting something in another way. It's like, what is the interest behind it? What's the motivation behind it? Sure. So to know that there's a guy like you who's doing this stuff, just completely honest and open and raw like that. It's very, very important. Well thank you. I really appreciate it. Like number one, be being respected by somebody like you. I just means so much to me because, you know, all my life I'll ever wanted to do is like, I always wanted to prove myself. I always thought I had to prove myself as a kid. Like Oh, I did this or that, but I feel like these movies just kind of automatically do that for me.

Speaker 3:          00:43:04       I think you've been like automatically validating like everything I've tried to do my whole life, you know, I wanted to be a big feature film maker and make Arnold Schwarzenegger movies and that couldn't be the. That's the furthest thing from my mind right now is to make movies that are big action movies that are mindless. I want to make big, you know, big documentaries that are smart. Well, it's interesting as life goes on and you know, you change and evolve and you know, your motivations changed. But I, I recommend your movies still. A lot of people, man, particularly the prescription thugs because of this. So many issues that have come up over the last, you know, it seems like the last couple of decades in this country are just unprecedented numbers of people that are addicted to pills. It's crazy. There's a couple of million people walking around completely checked out and I feel like, uh, it, it definitely needs to be.

Speaker 3:          00:43:54       I, I still, I can't wrap my mind around why the government hasn't stepped in and said we have to fight this opioid epidemic. I think they're getting paid off. Why isn't the government putting, making the companies that make oxycontin? Like for example, purdue Pharma, purdue, Pharma admitted like we got all these people addicted. We lied to doctors, they admitted it and they got fined. But the fine was only like a little tiny percent of what they made you get fined 200 million, or even if you get fined a billion dollars, he made $8,000,000,000. Who Cares? You don't even feel it because you're going to make another billion next year. And after that actually call it the price of doing business. They build into those fines into, you know, into the product. So they know, hey, we're probably going to get fined on

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       this for 400 million. Let's just build it into the cost of the drug. I mean, it's, it's an insane system that we have here for products that are supposed to help people. Well, it's also this disingenuous thing that politicians do with it. Pretend they're looking out for the people, but yet, how are you, how come you haven't heard a single politician in decades? Say a word about cigarettes? Obama got into office, he was smoking cigarettes, got in, which is just, that's half a million people just in this country die prematurely every year because of that. And I think, uh, you know, if we look at tobacco and we look at the problems with tobacco, what's the big problems with it? They put all these chemicals in the tobacco and if they could just pan that. Let me, I don't think actual natural tobacco is that bad for you? Well, how many people are dying from cigars?

Speaker 1:          00:45:14       Not a lot. Not a lot. Not, not that I know. I mean maybe it's abuse. Maybe if you get crazy with it, but that's kinda like wine and the wine is great. But if you drink wine like four or five bottles a day, you're going to kill your liver. Yeah. It's just like so many things like things like that, like wine and wine feels like kind of like Kratom has this sort of self limiting thing. Like wine. You could drink too much of it, but if it feels so shitty and it's like Kratom is kind of the same way. Like as you take too much of it, you'll just feel so crappy that year. You're going to know never to do that again. Where does it do? How does it make you feel? Crappy, because you said yes too much, just stomach aches, nausea, um, you know, and when I say so I guess I should, I should mentioned that.

Speaker 1:          00:45:54       What I actually took, I don't even know if it was Kratom when I took was a product and I'll never do this again. It was, it was like some extract as somebody gave me and I tried it and that's what made me sick. So it could have been way stronger than regular Kratom. There could have been something else in it, but that's sort of, that was my first like, okay, be smart about this. Look at the, look at the packaging and a lot, a lot. A big problem with Kratom is most of the cranium that's on the market. This is the only company in the entire country or world that packages credit. I'm like a dietary supplement. Every other supplement, if you look on the back, it'll say right here, not for human consumption. That's problem. Can they. Can people buy this right now? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:46:30       They could buy it. Yeah, for now. Sure. Yeah. In this company is from Vegas so that they do a lot of business in Vegas to actually in health food stores in Vegas. Explain it to people so they could get an. Obviously you nor I have any stake in this at all. This is called urban ice urban ice organics. They have a website. Yeah. They have a website, I believe it's urban ice organics.com or urbanites.com. I'm not even sure if they tell you the truth, but um, any, any like head shop should have Kratom um, they saw a lot of this in Vegas. So in Vegas it's all over. Um, but you know what the other thing we talked about, it's like why are they making illegal? The Guy who owns this company made a lot of money off of it and I'm sure you know, millions and millions of dollars.

Speaker 1:          00:47:11       So like when you make millions and millions of dollars, people want to know like, hey dude, you didn't go through the process. And I think we are. Kelly and I were just talking like what the process to make something a, you know, dietary supplement is a long arduous process and I feel like Kratom may need to go through that process because like we don't have enough information on it and it hadn't been studied. It's sort of something that slipped through the cracks. Like nobody really knew about it. It wasn't that popular and it's been around for 2000 years and no one ever decided to say, hey, this is a dietary supplement. Wow. Now these other ones that you were talking about, the other ones when you were saying if this gets illegal, there's, there's similar name those again, what does it against? Our esop I think is one of them and Aka Yuma, which is like, I don't think it's Japanese or something, but Aka Uma and soursop.

Speaker 1:          00:47:58       I've never tried them. I don't know. I've just read about them, but they have a similar effect. Allegedly. That's what it says. Yeah. That's what they say. But there haven't been as popular so maybe, you know, like, I feel like they're not as popular because it probably not as good or strong, but I don't know man. So what do we have isolated? Like what is the pressure to try to get it illegal? Yeah, we, we've kept trying to isolate, you know, and we've talked to the people that are against it and their congress people that are against it are grieving parents that are against it. Um, we, you know, like nobody in big Pharma is going to come out and say, hey, we're going to make this a drug and screw all you. Like, they're not going to really say that. So it's really when you get into Washington, like we were just in Washington for a week and everything so shady and underhanded in my mind, like all these people are, are working together.

Speaker 1:          00:48:49       They're all in cahoots, you know, like everything's in everything seemed to be like, I don't know, just the, the congressman that I talked to mark Pocan from Wisconsin, a marijuana and create them or both illegal there and he's kind of fighting for it to be legal. And like I said, he's one of the only congress people I met that was willing to go to bat for these kinds of things. And I think we need more congress people like that, that are looking out for the citizens. So there are state laws against it. Uh, there's six states, I believe that I've Ban Kratom. I think they're Wisconsin's one of them. Uh, Tennessee, Alabama, and I'll remember the rest of them, but there's a couple of states where it's band. And what do they cite when they say that? It's deaths, deaths and danger and kids taking it, you know, everything's about protecting the children and saving the children.

Speaker 1:          00:49:37       But you know, none of the people in the Kratom Industry, I've never said like, hey, let's age restrict this, let's make it, you know, 21 and over 18 and over are 25 and older. It doesn't, you know, whatever, whatever they want to do. Like no one's even the FDA has never even come and taught like it's impossible and this is the big problem. It's impossible to talk to the FDA or dea. I just spoke to the, the spokesman for the dea last week, Melvin Patterson and I said, hey Mr Patterson, I would really like to come down and do an interview with you. He's like, Oh yeah, sorry we don't do that and I want to say about you work for me. Like you know, we pay, we pay their salaries. I know people here that will done. But like I think there just needs to be more transparency 100 percent in the dea and the FDA. You can't find out the FDA's like scientology. Like you can't find out anything about it. Like when you try to do research on and try to find out, you know, who's doing what or whatever,

Speaker 3:          00:50:27       there's not a whole lot of transparency and that's why documentary film makers like me have to use like the freedom of freedom of Information Act where if we request something from the government, you know, they have to give it to us and that's something that really helps us. So this is a, we were talking about what a rabbit hole this is, but this is a weird rabbit hole for you to have started this out as something like, you're, you're finding this plant to be beneficial. You see all these people that are benefiting from it and you're like, hey, this is a great subject. I want to let the world know about it. And then as you're doing it, it's theirs. You start feeling this dark push for it to be scheduled one and, and just start making illegal. What's that journey been like? I'm weird.

Speaker 3:          00:51:06       You know, I think I'm scary a little bit because uh, he started this thing and I thought it was just going to go down to two. I mean, I thought they were going to maybe make it illegal and then you know, maybe we have nothing. You know what, once you make something a schedule one drug, it's impossible. Ask The people matter. The marijuana people, it's impossible to take it off the schedule one, it's, it can happen but it's really hard. So I think that the idea is not to get it there in the first place, whether it was talking about the dea removing marijuana from schedule one this summer and they backed out of it. They were just. I just read some more about that today. That's still kind of up in the air, Huh? Well they got close to it and they said they were going to reconsider it and apparently a lot of people were very helpful.

Speaker 3:          00:51:44       They thought this is gonna be at scheduled ones. Ridiculous. No medicinal value. I mean they've shown marijuana to cure some forms of cancer to say there's no medicinal value for it is completely ridiculous. We need to start dumping our money into researching these plants because like how like look, you have these Pharma companies and I don't know if you've seen this shell on discovery where they show you how they come up with new drugs. They basically take like there's a machine and it's like this fucking robot and it takes like every fucking substance in the world and combines it until like it makes millions and millions of different, different kinds of fucking like things, you know, different kinds of drugs and then they start testing it on like every different disease to see if it works. So it's like it's like shooting in the dark. It's like they have no, like they're like there's a machine that will just make a drug and then they figure out if it works on something rather than like we already know that Kratom works for this, this and this and we already know that marijuana works for this, this and this.

Speaker 3:          00:52:39       Why not put the money into studying that rather than the shooting in the dark, making some weird combination. Have you seen that? That. No, I haven't seen it at all. I have to find that sounds almost like that. That sounds like a. they're like, you know, the like they use those algorithms to try to work the stock market. That's something similar. It just throwing numbers up. Yeah. Well there's a lot of them to come out real bad. I mean, I know a dude who had a stroke, a young guy from Vioxx. That stuff. Yeah. You probably know about that. Arthritis, arthritis medication. Yeah. I know the guy in his thirties. Who the Fuck Australian. That stuff. Yeah. Yeah. See, that's this. They pulled it off the market. Yeah. They pulled that off the market. I think there was 55,000 deaths from Vioxx and Kratom zero. Oh, weird marijuana.

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       How many strange. Yeah, man. That's A. There's a business in selling people pills. You know, living in a twisted world we live in. People are going to keep that from somebody who's in pain is ridiculous. Well, I'm hoping that as time goes on, we're slowly starting to understand that it is impossible for your doctor to know all the ramifications and repercussions. Sure. Involved in any. Any drug. Yup. And there's just no way. I was just on the show, the doctors with a doctor whose son was taking Kratom, he found his son was a drug addict and he kind of found out about it. And then his son said, dad, I'm going to get off all the heroin. I'm going to start taking Kratom. And he said his son has been on Kratom now for, I don't know, like six months. He's been sober. He had been happier than he's ever been and this doctor is 100 percent down with it.

Speaker 3:          00:54:14       And he was on the show, the doctors with me and he was arguing with, you know, there's a guy from a. what's that show intervention. One of the dudes from intervention was on the doctors with us arguing like, yeah, people get addicted to Kratom all the time. It's like, dude, you're a marketing guy. Like these people in Rehab, like you gotta understand. The reason why if you Google Kratom rehabs come up is because rehabs have marketing teams, they're trying to get as many people into the doors as they can. So they tell you Kratom's bad and they put it on their website. Narcan on is a big a rehab center. They're owned by scientologists and they're all over the Kratom thing saying like, Hey, are you addicted to Kratom? Call us, you know, and it's just like, I feel like the people that get addicted to it, like I, I went to Rehab, I've been in rehab that with people that were there for marijuana and you want to just be like, dude, what the fuck are you doing here?

Speaker 3:          00:55:03       Like number celebrity rehab. Yeah. Yeah. But, but people do have a problem with it, so it's okay. Like you can go to rehab for anything. So going for Kratom is no different than going for like depression or some gambling. You have to go to rehab for gamble. So I don't, I don't know why they're marketing it to people. I think it's kind of sadistic in a way. Like they're looking for people that are on Kratom, you know that to, you know, if. I Dunno, I mean I don't know why they. Well they don't have any personal experience with it. Maybe they're not as nefarious as we think it is. Maybe they just ignorant. Sure. And the and the good rehabs aren't doing that. I should say, like when I went cliffside Malibu, they don't have a Kratom thing on their website because there are legitimate rehab center.

Speaker 3:          00:55:42       I was talking about celebrity rehab. I remember when Eric Roberts was on. It was hilarious. Everybody else has shaken throwing up and sweating. Eric Roberts sitting there with a newspaper or a cup of Costco, get slippers on. He was just in there for pot. Yeah. Like there's no, there was no withdrawal. There was nothing happened. You know, they go with what does it feel like? He's like, I feel fine. I just, I just don't have weed. Well the problem with when you tell somebody that they have a problem, they start thinking, fuck, I have a problem. If you ever had a cop behind you and you never did anything. No. But you're like looking at both hands on the wheel and yeah. You feel like it has my license. My license is good. I pay my insurance, I have a gun. There's a gun in his. Why am I afraid of

Speaker 2:          00:56:23       fucking freaking out? Am I speeding? Not going the speed limit, but meanwhile there's something. If someone tells you, Hey, you've got a problem, you've got a problem, you might not think you have a problem, but you got a problem. Like fucking got a problem. What's my problem? Your problem is Kratom, or your problem is sex, or your problem is whatever the fuck it is. Exercise. You're addicted to exercise. If someone could tell you have a problem, and then most of us are at least a little insecure, almost everybody I know is at least a little insecure and as soon as someone accuses you of something, you all, you start considering the possibility there, right?

Speaker 1:          00:56:55       Yeah. And then sometimes you try to hide it more. Yes. That's, that's my, my, you know, as an addict, I was like, okay, well, not now they're onto me. I better really, really hide this. I had a conversation one day with my dad. I'll never forget it. My Dad is like the nicest person in the world. You've seen him in the movies and one day, um, I was out of money. I'm in my forties and I'm out of money. That's ridiculous. That's stupid. You know what I mean? Because I was. But I was a drug addict so my dad said to me, I don't know what's wrong with you, but I think you're a drug addict or an alcoholic or something, but there's no reason why a guy in there 40 years old, she'd be out of money. And I'm like, you know what man, he's right. And that was that conversation that it was about three months before I went to Rehab. But like that was the conversation. It was that conference. It was, it was my dad being disappointed in me. It was like that conversation that really sort of shook me to the ground. Like somebody telling me I had a problem. It kind of shook me to the core because he yelled at me when he said it. He never yelled at me.

Speaker 2:          00:57:49       Wow. Well sometimes that's all you need is one person's opinion. Who you really love. Yeah. Boot and the asked from dad. Yeah. And you go shit.

Speaker 1:          00:57:56       And my dad's been through everything. You know, he's had cancer. He's add his half of the intestine pulled out, he's had all these issues and they're not due to drugs or alcohol. So it makes me feel even more guilty because like my issues are just due to something I'm doing.

Speaker 2:          00:58:09       Right, right. Well, except arthritis. Yeah. But I'm feeling it now. I don't know what it's doing, but something's going on. Got a boner now. Does that happen? Probably warning. No shit man. I wish. Um, no. Just uh, I feel good. Um, it doesn't, it's not. I'm not negatively affected me in any way. I don't feel slow or anything like that. That's what I was assuming it was. I mean, literally today, one of the things that I wanted to do before I'm talking to you about this, I wanted to do no research because I literally wanted to just go in with my ignorance so that I can question you from ignorance.

Speaker 1:          00:58:45       And interestingly enough, if you try to do research, it's kind of a, it's kind of biased right off the bat from Google. Like when you, like I said, when you search Kratom, a lot of times what comes up are the rehab centers that are paying to be

Speaker 2:          00:58:57       or let's try it right now. And then if you type in Kratom band, you'll get more of a across the board, up and down, you know, I'm going to try it with being because I've been using windows so let's see if they have the same thing mark and I don't know. Big is not bad man. I don't, I don't have any problems with bang. Okay. Kratom read on Amazon Dot Com. See they try to sell you it. Oh, trying to sell it. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       Kratom red. Okay. Drug Abuse. Kratom affects. Okay. Narcan, not, I did not know narcan on is owned by scientology, but I have a, my buddy Anthony Roberts, he was like, uh, when I was doing bigger, stronger, faster, it was like this dude that would always hit me up online about stuff. And he kind of knew everything. So I hired him to work on this movie as a, as a researcher and a writer and he's been. He's been teaching me a lot about how to find stuff, you know, let's, let's see what the Narcan on people have to say about it. Effects of drugs. So it's [inaudible] dot org. The effects of drug abuse. It says Kratom is a relatively new drug to the US and Europe and has been used for many years in Southeast Asia as an anti dye or real medicine. Hey, doesn't really, you know, I've heard that.

Speaker 3:          01:00:06       Yeah. A lot of people. So you get diarrhea, you take Kratom a painkiller and a recreational drug. Kratom is the popular name for a tree and the drug comes from its leaves. The drug may be bought in leaf form, but in this country is more likely pur purchased as a capsule with a powdered leaf material or chopped up in the form of a leaf that can be used for a tea over smoking. Yeah. This says t on it that people make actual 10 make tea out of it. Tastes like shit. I think it tastes terrible. It's pretty, um, pretty bitter. You know, it says the effects of Kratom come on rather quickly and last between five and seven hours, although high doses can last longer. It's heavily promoted as illegal, undetectable safe drug that can be used to come off stronger drugs. It is not illegal the United States, but the breakdown products of Kratom can be detected in some drug tests.

Speaker 3:          01:00:55       Is that true? Like for people that work at ups or something? I haven't seen that happen now. I don't. I don't think that's true. They might be scaring you. Yeah, probably trying to get you to join. I don't think it will show up on a drug test. It's not an opiate. It's not the same, you know, same ingredients. It says the breakdown products of Kratom can be detected with some drug dose. Hmm. Maybe, maybe some drug tests that are looking at. Well, there, there is a specific drug test that looks for it, you know, that goes, that will go in and look, you know, look forward just Kratom and that's what they, that's what they use when somebody commits suicide or whatever it makes like, oh, is there, is there Kratom in their, in their system or whatever, you know, and there's 15 deaths from Kratom at 14 to 15 deaths are all polypharmacy, which means we've taken several different things, but most of the time it's like polypharmacy.

Speaker 3:          01:01:40       It's like, oh, they were taking Xanax, Vicodin and Kratom and you're like, why would you blame it on the Kratom it seems like the least, the, uh, you know, agregious of all of them, if it's only in combination with other pharmaceuticals, that sounds crazy. I mean, that's like marijuana, like, you know, it's like, who knows, who knows how many people have died on marijuana and other drugs. It's funny that you bring up Thailand because they're using Thailand as an example here. More than 13,000 people were arrested for Kratom related crimes in Thailand. That's just because it's illegal in Thailand. The leader of the opiod industry, they conveniently ignore that, so the drug is abused for it's abused for its sedative or stimulating effects, not used. It says abused. Will say. The thing is I. I don't think that like taking a normal, you know, I think if I took, you know, 50 pills a day, that'll be abusing it.

Speaker 3:          01:02:33       I maybe take six pills a day, maybe at the most 10. Then you're even the term pill is a weird word because what you did basically taking this powder plants. Yeah. Well the, the term drug is a weird word. If you went back and read that statement that you just read and substituted the word plant, it wouldn't sound bad at all. The plant comes as a powder. The plant is this, the plant does that. It wouldn't sound bad, but when you use the word drug of course sit in a corner. Well, drugs such a weird word because it covers too many different effects. You know, covers stimulants, depressants. So here's what it says, a person using this drug may expect or may not expect or want the following undesirable effects of Kratom edginess, nervousness, vomiting can be severe, prolonged nausea, it can be severe, prolonged sweating, itching, constipation, delusions, lithology, respiratory depression, tremors, aggressive or combative behavior, psychotic episodes, hallucinations and paranoia.

Speaker 3:          01:03:28       There's a big thing you just mentioned that respiratory depression and has not been shown with Kratom. And that's, and that's what kills people with oxy. What about hallucinations to people who say on them? I've never met one psychotic episodes, never met one aggressive or combative behavior. Um, Nah, never, never really experienced that. The only thing I can say that I have experienced are like people that feel better and are in better moods. Here's an interesting one. Addiction affects me include number one, loss of sexual desire. People like, fuck this drug last actually prolong you during sex. Oh Shit. Prolong you. So like make it harder to finish basically darkening of the skin or face. What do you want to be black. That's why that's an effect. That's negative effect. Well, you know, you know where that comes from. Darkening of the face and the skin comes from. I'm in Thailand. When they did the study in 1975, they were researching a migrant like the workers, the workers out in the fields. So the research these workers out in the fields that were, that were true in the Kratom leaves St. Oh, they're turning brown because they're out in the fear on the fucking Sun.

Speaker 3:          01:04:39       So like these people are turning brown. Oh my God, that's so stupid. And that's listed as a side effect. Melanin. Well, and then you'll, then you'll have people like congresspeople and, and other people that are fighting against this. Try to use that as a fact. Here's where it gets really weird. Withdrawal effects of them are very similar to those of opiate, like heroin or prescription painkillers. Let's hear those. Here's the withdrawal effects. Diarrhea. I thought it was anti-diarrhea. Make up your fucking mind. Um, muscle pain. I thought it's good for pain. Yeah, that's great. Right? Okay. Muscle tremors or, or jerking. You were saying the, the, uh, vet

Speaker 1:          01:05:17       all his muscle jerking and twitching goes away. They're seeing that. That's a side effect. Riff, restlessness and sleeplessness. Does it help you? Uh, you know, I haven't, no, I haven't like really stayed up all night on it, but, you know, I let you know, there's adverse effects to everything that we could possibly ingest. So it's more like let's take a big group of these adverse effects and see which ones occur more often, you know, when people. And it really, it really hasn't been shown across the board to do all these things to everybody, you know. So like there was one guy that was on Kratom for three years and they said he's got to be addicted to Kratom. We're going to study him and we're going to see what happens when we take them off credit, you know, when he gets off Kratom. So he gets off Kratom and you know, what happened to him, what he had a runny nose.

Speaker 1:          01:06:05       Whoa. Asked Gary. That was the only. The only, the only thing that he complained about was like a runny nose here in large font it says narcan can help the person who is addicted to Kratom in large words and then it goes back. Why have you drunk has different effects? Oh Man. The route back to sobriety is much the same from person to person. Recovery. Recovery must include release relief from incessant cravings and you're the beginnings of Rehab. You know, you know what we said about, we were talking actually heard your podcast and you brought me up on a, on another, you know, on another one of your podcasts and we were talking about time. The amount of time it takes to get sober and I still, I still believe that, right? I still believe like it takes time and I still be short, but the thing that we have to talk about is like, you don't just take this and get off of opiates, you take this and you go to Aa meetings and you go to, you know, whatever, whatever works, counseling, go to counseling.

Speaker 1:          01:07:06       You go to a therapist and go talk to them. You talk to them about why you couldn't get off the drugs and you tell them you've taken us and you say, Hey, let's see if we can. If we can solve this problem, you know, but it's, let's not be stupid about it. Like I went to the doctor and I got one when I, when I was addicted to opiates and I was, I would drive around my car crying. I'd be crying saying, I just want help, you know, my brother was dying from this. I knew he was going to die from it. I knew it. So I was driving around. I would cry and be like, I need, I need rehab. I need help. I don't know what to do. Every Rehab I called was like $4,000, $6,000, and I didn't have the money. At the time I was a drug addict, you know, I was broke.

Speaker 1:          01:07:41       If I, if I had known about something like this back then, it would have completely changed the person I am now. I would have, I wouldn't have lost five or six years, you know? Wow. That's fucking crazy. It's just crazy. It's so. It's so weird when you're a grown adult and all of a sudden you find out about something that's been around for thousands of years. It's been helping people, you know, like I, I try to pay attention to how the fuck did this one for me being like the guy who did bigger, stronger, faster, always talking about supplements, everything. I missed it too. Wow. You know, I know. I know about every supplement on the market. I know everything

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       on it makes every supplement that's out there. I look at them, I want to see what they do, you know, and um, you know, I missed it. It's the, that is really fascinating. It's just really, really fascinating. So now we're in this state where the dea held off it scheduled one distinction right there. We're going to designate it as a schedule one and the dea isn't, I think this big monster and everybody thinks everybody's like, oh, the dea and the dea. I believe from what I've gathered from this whole situation is a data. They're not happy about what happened. They, they, they didn't know. They weren't aware that this many people use Kratom and are happy about it. I think that they really didn't know. I don't think it's like, I don't think it's as dvs as people think like, I don't think it was a big, you know, and, and now it definitely could be something that is pushed by big Pharma, but I feel like the way that the dea has reacted so far has been, you know, pretty normal.

Speaker 3:          01:09:17       Pretty reasonable. Yeah. Reasonable. Yeah. Like, it's been like, like, Hey, okay, I'm sorry, let's open up a website and take some comments. Well, I really hope people listen to this. Get to it, give it to give the address that one more time. It's credit kratom comments.org Kratom Comments Dot Org, k r a t o m comments.org. And so December first, once December first rolls around, which is right around the corner, what happens if they get a bunch of notes and I mean they have to get 10,000, is that what it. Don't have to get any certain number, but I think if they get $10,000, like that's the number we were at. Everybody. That's where you were aiming for, was aiming for, you know, like, what's great is um, I've actually become friends, a lot of people in this Kratom community and it's not the kind of people that you would think like, you know, I feel like, um, when I went to the march in Washington DC, I didn't know what kind of people I was going to meet, you know, but I bet you know, mothers and grandmothers and you know, like all these people that were like, they were like my mom, you know, and I wasn't expecting that.

Speaker 3:          01:10:17       I was expecting to meet a bunch of people. Like what's up dude? And that Kinda that Kinda saying like, yeah man, the government sucks. Let's keep this legal tower seven bro. Look into it. It was, it was vets, you know, veterans that fought overseas for us and you know, have risked a lot for us. It was a mothers and grandmothers and people like that more than it was of these, a devious characters that they think are using Kratom wow. So this is, this is a really important issue. And when, when is your documentary going to come out? We're hoping to documentary will come out early next year. So just a matter of how fast we can get it together. So we're almost done shooting. Okay. So now it's just the editing process. And then also are you going to wait around to see what happens after December first?

Speaker 3:          01:11:03       Yeah. Yeah. We'll, we'll wait around. We're going to start editing. We're starting editing right now. So basically, you know, if things happen, for example, Bernie Sanders is one of the guys who signed the Kratom letter. I want to talk to him, I'd love to. He. He's kind of an amazing guy to me. I would love to pick his brain about this and see what he thinks. So it's impossible now these people down, but you never know when you might get five minutes with Bernie at a rally somewhere, you know. So we're going to continue to try to get those, those bigger names that we wanted to get. I think they're important. Orrin Hatch's involved in this. Orrin Hatch is a senator from Utah that's been very involved in the dietary supplements for a long, long time. So, uh, we, we'd like to get his opinion on it and you know, but like, it's kind of crazy.

Speaker 3:          01:11:43       I would hope that the dea and the FDA would listen to this interview and like sit with us and do an interview. I got one. Yeah. I would love to like, just let them speak their mind. I don't do interviews where I go in, in an ambush. People, I let them speak their mind. No, you don't at all. Um, I, I think I took it probably an hour ago, right? How long? I take it 15 minutes into the show. It's A. Yeah, I mean, I guess I'd have like a mild, very mild stimulant sort of effect that I feel. But uh, it's, it's, it's nothing, nothing to be concerned with. You're not dying know it doesn't me. You know what I mean? It doesn't really like I've taken some stuff before I, I was in Colorado this weekend and I took a lot of edibles.

Speaker 3:          01:12:30       Whoa. Who? Those fucking people aren't screwing around, man. They're going deep in Colorado. Man. I heard you are a special. Talking about edibles. That was amazing. So was pretty sensitive to them too, right? I guess. I Dunno man. I'm more sensitive than Joey Diaz. Joey Diaz that like, I'm on that level. Like 300 milligrams. Yeah. That's cool. That's what you take. Oh, I, I don't even do it because they just have. I'd have to take too much of it. Well, one time I did a podcast with Sam Harris recently and I have this spray that is a thousand milligrams, like I guess it's a thousand milligrams and the whole bottle, but it's like, I don't know. I don't know exactly how to spray. This is the more mild version. This one's 175 milligrams, which think it's like 20 milligrams of pump or 10 milligram between 10 and 20 milligrams of pumped depending on how strong the stuff that makes sense.

Speaker 3:          01:13:20       This is jumbo. Jumbo makes a bunch of great stuff. All organic. They used to get data dispensary. I'll hook you up. But the uh, hey you want me to do is take this one the spray. Enjoy. Don't get crazy. You know what's weird? I don't know, I don't like to smoke pot. I like, I like this stuff better because I'm just so used to taking things like that. So. And I also feel like I don't want to get back into the hole. My girlfriend would flip out if I started smoking pot, but to use some like edible stuff and play around with this and see if it works for pain and stuff like that to me is something that's very, very viable. Yeah. Isn't that funny? Where people worry about like smoking is like, oh, he's smoking drugs, but if you're spraying breath spray under your tongue, it's like, Eh, he's just relieving pain, you know, I just think we need to open our minds to a lot of these substances that are out there that can help us, you know, it's great to say don't take anything that's not the world that we live in now.

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       Right? Well CBDS, CBDS are great because they're not psychoactive at all. And uh, I. Shannon Briggs was just in earlier so that it's helped him tremendously. CBD. That's pot that'll know that fucked up, so you carry care, but you know, the, the difference being the editable version of marijuana has a very different psychoactive effect too. That's why a lot of people think they're getting spiked. Like they'll eat a pot cookie and they'll think, oh my god, somebody put an acid in this because it's really psychedelic and the way it's processed by the body, your liver produces this metabolite called 11 hydroxy metabolite and it's just way more powerful than thc. You the only comedian that I've seen bring science into that fall into that pit. That was amazing. You know, just to kiss your ass a little bit. That entire special is at the top of the game.

Speaker 3:          01:15:02       Oh, thanks bill. Thanks. I'm hustling. That's great. So, uh, I wanted to get you. I don't have a whole lot of time, so I wanted to get you in here today and get it done. But um, what else? Um, can you tell people about this and what else can be done? I think that people need to go to Kratom comments that org leave a comment, uh, people can, you know, they can call the dea, they can ask for Melvin Patterson, he's the spokesman. They can leave a message with him. I think this Kratom comments.org though is going to be the most effective and also like people need to seek it out and people can hit me up on facebook or instagram. I'm, I'm pretty readily available so if people have questions and want to, you know, hit me up then just hit me up. I mean I'm a big, strong, fast on social media and I will answer your questions as much as I can.

Speaker 3:          01:15:44       Like I'm not, I don't hide from people, you know. No you don't. And when the documentaries out, can you come back in and I'll watch it and we'll talk about it and will and hopefully we'll have some good news about it. And. All right folks, I'm. Hi, I'm Kratom right now and it doesn't do anything. My brother wants to get back in here with you too. Okay. I love that. Smelly. Yeah. Can I mentioned something about him? Yeah, for sure. He's got a big sale going on for a the black Friday. If you enter the Code Rogan, it's 20 percent opposite for his slingshot. How much you bench? Dot Net is his website for slingshot slingshot products. I had to plug them. Okay, beautiful. Will shout out to mark. All right, well thank you Chris. Really, really appreciate it. And do you have a name for this documentary right now? We're calling it a leaf of faith, a leap of faith. I like it. I like it. So if you have a new name, we'll have to go like that. I think I did that name. It's cool. Let's go with a leaf of faith. Beautiful. Thanks Chris. Why are you so much? I appreciate it.
