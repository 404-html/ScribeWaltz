Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Here we go. Three, two, one. My phone's off. Oh, we're live. Ladies and gentlemen. This is a fight companion podcast. If you've ever listened to one of these before, oftentimes we don't even watch the fights, but we're talking some more things. Yes, but we're watching the fights. Certainly at least some of the time. There's more to life than fight. Did you guys decide to go? Did you call each other and say, let's, let's double blast with the Lilac, or is that just quizzes? Just luck to happy coincidence. Geniuses were purple. I just decided to wear a purple. I got here, he's wearing purple and he's got a fucking purple car, so he doubled purple. Oh yeah. Well, that car, if you're against me now, I've read that Lilac, and I'm going to call that Lilac is actually a head Turner with the ladies. They're drawn to the color.

Speaker 1:          00:00:45       Really? Yes. So they say if you're going to go out on a date or you're going to go out on the town, you might want to throw some lilac on your body, or maybe ladies, we'll see the lilac and think you're trying too hard. Maybe, but it suits my eye and I can't take my eyes off your torso, but yet you don't like his car, his car. Well, you told Joe that allows, let's get rid of that. Yeah. Well that he doesn't know. He looks, he goes, what do you have a wing on the back and I finished her decubitus ask down. Fuck. Well we don't need that fan. I do. They actually make your touring package. Hey, the gt three. You just attacked my personage of the windbreaker. I mean he's like one of them. Jogging Dad. No, I'm not. I'm John. I'm an athlete and athletes keep their muscles but educate them on the wing.

Speaker 1:          00:01:26       No, the wing keeps the acid down. That's what it does. It's dying for us. But here's my card. How come you bought a car in La traffic where you got to keep the acid? Wilson traffic, but no, I have one of those two. Right. You know I have one with a wing gt three Rs tale. Isn't that what they're called? No, that's different. The whale tail is like a, it's like, it's different. It's like the turbos. They had a whale tail. It's like a flat looking kind of thing that is a part of the rear deck. This is lifted above the rear deck and actual tail. It's more, it is more effective than they have whale tails anymore. No, the whale tails went out with the 1993 turbo. Expensive to buy now. I guess he could look in a whale, tail, cars, cars, cars like that.

Speaker 1:          00:02:10       Our instinct, because it's like the psychologic thing for all guys. It's like, at least I know I have the power under my hood. I'm never going to use it, but I know I still have a Tesla. We all want to know we have it. Listen to what you're just doing. What that text data mail bro. No, not know. Just cause I'm in a windbreaker. Right? Is there a Beta common? No. Uh, drive the totality, Bro. If you drive fast, it's literally results in hundreds of pounds of downforce fast and you don't have to drive that fast to feel the difference. Have you ever been out of second gear in that car? Of course. Who'd have to go very fast policing? Listening. I really do. You Beta irresponsible, but you have to that fucking Tesla that thinks fast as shit. I, well my buddy, you know France cap that Frank Grillo has the hatch to put the headphones talk over other, he's got that dodge.

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       Um, here's a challenge or horsepower. He has like a Hellcat that souped up. Oh yeah, I beat him. What you saying? I beat him off the line. Posts of your racing irresponsibly on the streets. Children, my traffic fast and furious started revving his engine. Don't rev your engine at me. I'm good. But if you rev your engine, I mean I'll meet you halfway and carry your engine. Doesn't even, rev was actually just just be cool about it. I let him make his noise. We're going to get from it. You're going to get that new roadster, the one that they launched into space soap as fuck. You're going to get out of it. He's got a 600 mile range. It's lighter and they have more room for batteries and they're more efficient with the battery software and everything is a problem with the test of the roses.

Speaker 2:          00:03:43       It looks cool. The roads still looks dope. It looks like a combination of a Ferrari and Lotus. You never seen it? No. Pull up that uh, that, my problem with the Tesla right now is that the battery doesn't last long enough. It just doesn't have anywhere to charge it. Get better though. Like the newer ones that every year to get better, better, better. There it is. It can handle it. It's pretty dope. Handle space that roof up. Put the roof down. Shame. You draw a picture of the roof down. Kids call it, get the titties out. They get that Sun. 1.9 seconds, 1.9 seconds. 60 that's a demon. That car will make your fucking rs. Porsche. Watch your slow like mine. We'll get one nine seconds. Zero to 60. That is a dope call. Can I, you know what? 250 miles an hour to 21 mile range.

Speaker 2:          00:04:32       It just doesn't do it for me to do it for you. Hope that car, I need a v 10 I need a Fucking v eight you have an inline say line six. I need something pretty gnarly though. Look at that. I'm getting that is just so I can be fast on Brendan, just so I can laugh at you. You'll be a lot faster. You could drive that car to Vegas, dude, off in that car. I wouldn't, I wouldn't do that unless he was wearing less. He was, I don't know man. I just can't get behind the electric car. You will. Well, you've seen the Porsche. You've seen the Porsche Electric car coming out. If it's going to do it, it can be Porsche, Porsche. It looks like dog shit compared to that dude, I don't test anymore. How much does that tie can tilt the no worse than tiny all electric one that looks like shit, but Jamie bring that shit up.

Speaker 2:          00:05:18       Porsche, I think it's called a tie can or something like that. Take hat. It looks. It looks very similar to that, but way cooler. How much is that tissue? How much of that roadster? Tesla, they don't know yet because it hasn't been released, but 200 200 yeah, look at that. What? That does not look nearly. That's a nice give us. The test kept pretty similar but it's a beautiful car. Looks way better and I'm not saying because my good friend Ilan Musk makes it by the way, we're good friends. Oh my God, I liked it. That's not doe text each other. Do you on Musk? I'm his friend is your best friend. It's got bottom o'clock. See that clock over there? I got him one of those. Oh Shit. Tgt Studios clogging. No big deal. I think I've nothing weird about that.

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       Don't be scared of that wheat does. He still trying to build that subway underneath that mother fucker is trying to sell everything. He if you, if you like talk to him in private. I wish I could try his brain out for a day and find out what's going on in there but it's just rattling around information constantly. Things are flying around and grabbing it and stuffing it into boxes and digging holes under the ground and shooting things to the moon. He's just, he just, his brain just doesn't stop. He's single. He is now hollow. When you talked to guys like that who are lateral thinkers, like you realize like the guy who made me feel really dumb and almost like a fraud was Brendan shop, not breading shop. Peter Teal. I tell I was listening to him talk and I went, yeah, I met him, I had dinner with at his house and I, and I was like, he was talking and I realized that everything I say is basically an amalgam of the things I've read or heard.

Speaker 1:          00:06:47       And these guys are the ones who write those things. He just thinks up things on his own. He started paypal with you on God. Damn. That's all those boys got rich. Yeah. Paypal. It's one of the ways, well, whenever you think you're a black belt, you realize you're a white belt. There you go. By Pat, I shit. To me he's pushed. Ilan. Ilan went on the podcast. When you ask them a question though, he really downloaded that data before you gave it. Oh boy. He's long pauses. He's, he's, I would say he's very, uh, he's enthusiastic. Almost like a child was certain things that with his blow torch, guns, stuff like that. But when it comes to thinking about things like he'll just sit down and pause before he gives you an answer. He wants to like really consider smart cause I just go and then fucking Tesla.

Speaker 1:          00:07:32       He's thoughtless. But that's also one of the charms of you is that you say stupid shit that you wish you didn't say right after you said it. Right? Right after he said, I know. He's like, God damn. I probably should have said that. Yeah, my tie crusher. Yeah, but look how well it's going. Yeah. I mean you do a showtime special fucking two and a half years into comedy. Not even right. How many years in the comedy, but I just want to film it to and change to and change at south sac. That's outstanding. I say stick with what got you to the dance. That's exactly right. Verbal diarrhea just keeps going until I get assassinated. Fascinating. Things will get sick. Yeah, it's going to be fixed on the wall. You're saying funny shit. Why do you think you'd get assassinated? Mad Shit. Which guy? I say crazy shit.

Speaker 1:          00:08:13       What's the referee wearing? The referees? Like wearing something around his waist punch? No, no, no. It's like a, it's an electronics are sleazebags a fanny pack. Is it? And maybe she has a fat Dick Cause he know. See what I'm saying? Both sides. He's carrying something. It looks like in the front. Maybe it is a fanny pack. Um, Tim, we don't know who's fighting Jane Lane. Jinguang is a bean. The Chinese a water. Yes he is. Is he in UFC folks watching at home? Four minutes and 37363530430 three seconds into the first round. Dude. Fuck this card. If it ain't chuck Tito. Oh Shit. Well they find it today, right? Guess?

Speaker 1:          00:08:58       Yeah, that's fine. They're fighting tonight. Is there an undercard for that or are they just in a car with great shape, right? Yes. They both look in great shape. Chuck has a gigantic, a vein across his bicep. They've been tested to consign pretty straight. Always had that like kind of his belly always sticks out. We call it the power. God's power gut. He's always had that even when he was at the top of the food chain yet when he was the best light heavyweight. Oh Shit. So water clipped him. Damn. Jim Lang. Even when chuck was at the top of the food chain, he always had that. Oh, it's just, that's just how he's built. He's just built odd. Tito was pointing at it. It was really funny. He was like making fun of him. But he was wearing a shirt. Yeah, he didn't have, it didn't make any sense.

Speaker 1:          00:09:39       Strange. You were in a shirt. The whole thing's been a little strange. I think they should have done like a, cause those guys should go out on their shields as hall of famers. I think. I wish you know trucks had, when they wanted to do the fight he called Dana. Dane was like, get the fuck out. It ain't happening. Good luck though. And so I wish they were done like a tough finale or like a big card and they're just like a feature of shit. Aye. Aye. Aye Support. Everyone's right to do whatever they want to do whenever they want to do it. As long as they're not hurting anybody. And this goes into that, right. I support your right to bull ride. I support your right to sky dive and do whatever you want to do, man. And if these guys like what is, what are, what is our thought?

Speaker 1:          00:10:15       And if they don't do this, they're going to live forever. No, I mean they, they, they know the risks. They're big boys. Yep. You know the real question is like should they be doing it and went through all the testing because I said I truck into both on my show. I asked Chuck, I'm like you've gone through all the testing with commission California. Cause when I was fighting going through California commissions, they are by far the strictest. You do not want to fight here if you're taking protein powder, they're the worst. Chuck's like I went through all the California commission shit. I'm like damn well I'm everything. I'm a big fan of this guy who runs it in California. Andy Foster, he's obese. He's really on top of the ball. He's super proactive. He's really smart. He used to fight himself lifelong martial artists for respect for the sport up, super progressive about people's weight cuts.

Speaker 1:          00:11:01       It doesn't want people cutting a shitload of weight in his state. He tries to monitor their hydration, wants to get your weight out in advance. He's ahead of it with everything. He's not a dinosaur. He said no, he's ahead of it. Also with weight classes, they instituted more weight classes in California for early on. So you guys aware of how one FC does there? When I talked about how did they do that and ask how do they do it? They don't. There's no weight cutting man. There's no way cutting. They do hydration tests. They do hydration tests. You fight whatever is closest to your natural way, which I think makes a move there. The one fc 100% is doing it better than anybody else. Hundred percent you know the problem with that is though something, well Connie, yes, they stopped the weight cutting. It's not necessarily, it's the division.

Speaker 1:          00:11:44       So the division is what you weigh what's, so Ben her and went up to one 85 he was one 70 and they jumped him up to one 85 which is like his real walk around weight, you know, and he's still, and they determine what that weight is. There's this, there's gotta be an official land has got to be, look, you could always manipulate your weight and stay healthy within a certain range of your discipline. They say can you would still be hydrated. So if you like, say if you said your best weight is one 65 you just decided that all you would have to do is make sure you got your body weight down and do it over a long period of time so that you're, you know, you're doing cardio, you're eating right, you're making sure and then keep your weight in that range.

Speaker 1:          00:12:20       Like you could decide to fluctuate 10 pounds one way or the other and still be fairly healthy. It's just a matter of how much certain kinds of exercise you do and how much time. But the thing about the certain kinds exercises, once people got some power, they don't want to give that power up. Right. And if you're like one 75 but jacked and you really would be better off one 65 but a little thinner, you know like cardio wise, a lot of guys don't want to give up that path. But also, you know, some guys are huge for their weight class and for whatever reason like there until, and who's the guy in Baltimore who, who lost Rory, mark them in the first title fight, Rory Macdonald, Lima, Lima, he, those guys are giant for their way. Class East. And I think sometimes some people have the kind of body, like some people have a body like they have, they have their two 30 but their weight on their ass and legs and they have small upper bodies.

Speaker 1:          00:13:06       And maybe that's not as good as someone like, I don't know who has like there until [inaudible] until that's all well and good. But the real thing should be what do you really weigh? All the other stuff is bullshit. All the other stuff is just, we've just agreed upon this cause we've been doing it this way for so long. It should be get to a healthy weight. What do you way, and there's gotta be more weight class from a wrestling background. Right? We're getting all, there's copy and roasting the hydration. They, they um, they make you urinate and they check your urine and they check the weight of your urine. That's one of the ways. There's a bunch of different sophisticated ways to do it, but they, yeah, because the more minerals and the more stuff is in your, your urine, it indicates how much water you have in your body.

Speaker 1:          00:13:51       Like what, you know, what percentage of of water you have in your body, whether or not you're dehydrated. Just make sure that I'm, I might be wrong about that. Double up on the P uh, uh, clear. That means you're more hydrated. Yes. But it doesn't necessarily know if you've taken a bunch of vitamins, you can still peek dark yellow. My Shit will be tucked to and some of it does come out in your urine, but some of it still is getting absorbed in your body. It's not all of it that's going out in your urine. It's still a good idea to take multivitamins. One FC hired a Misha Tate too. I was like the, she's moving. They're just going to move to Singapore. I think it's a smart movement. She's a smart girl. Sam is a great place to live. Hey Man. I mean they might, um, they might seriously be looking at her as like a big time executive. Like the female Dana White fur for Asia. Sounds like that's what they're doing. Well Rich Franklin is doing it too though, right? Isn't he have a big role over there as well? Huge role does he do over there? I'm not sure what he does, but

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       he did. He's got, he's got like some kind of executive job and does he live in Singapore as well? Was headed there. They're not going to commit to you unless you commit to them. Brandon barrel just one. Did He, was that in one ft? Did you see his fight to Brian and like two years doing it. Oh monster and have you, it's amazing dude. He looks so good. Diabetes either and he wasn't eating Olympic, a Greco guy. Brandon Vera. No, he was a very big, very high level. Very good wrestler. And you know what the funny thing is, he's really, what he's known for is his kickboxing. Amazing. You know, he had a hard time in the UFC dude because there was this, there was this one period of time where they were in contract negotiations and I feel like he lost a lot of momentum there.

Speaker 2:          00:15:42       Cause remember he uh, he beat Frank Mir, frank man and goes and then goes, I'm going to be the light heavyweight champion and heavyweight champions. Yeah. What's up and then their issues. Yeah, he was like out for a while. Long time. He got it. He knows fucking, we came back and the didn't, he also fight Fabricio for doom and he got trapped under the mount, wasn't it for doom? Who? Tk outcome was it for doom. I re, I remember feeling like virgin just handled, I remember you realize he had really good Jiu Jitsu because remember he submitted a us, what's that dude's name? Brazilian cat. Fuck, I forget his name now, but he's [inaudible] Silva be like getting dude dude, dude kills duty training. I was there with him at 10 plant one day but he was going to drop the squad. He dropped in a few times but he was also trained by a homeboy.

Speaker 2:          00:16:35       Rob Cayman. No for kickboxing, but he was in San Diego Alliance. He's, he doesn't last forever, but he was a black belt. Who's the black dude? Uh, Boyd Urban. Yeah, exactly. He's a little boy. Brandon. Well, what's crazy is how is his wrestling and his grappling was like what you would think if you looked at his skillset, but it's like he, he just got so good at striking like early on he was known more of a striker than anything by far. Do you remember when Frank Meir came back after the motorcycle on the accent? Like here's Brandon Vera and Brandon barreling. Cool story. Nay Nay and just fucked him up to my head. Kick knock out to like in the UFC big time head kicked out, knocked out Frank Mir with a head kick who smashed his nose. His nose got so fucked up in one fire member knows was literally completely fantastic.

Speaker 2:          00:17:35       It was great. We had some tough fights, man. You see him soccer kid do wrong when they let him do what. I've kicked people on the ground if first of all, he's so much, dude, he's so jack now or soul he fought was like other soccer kicks, not worried June. So you're allowed to kick that. Guys. Guys are on the ground. He soccer kick drum calm water. It's bad. That's not a good look on their back fighting. But that friend, that soccer head kicked, I'll make you rethink the side your head and think there's so much power in that part of the game is probably the most powerful kick you could do. Honestly. It's like it's one of those weird kicks. It doesn't really show up in martial arts except if there, you know, you allow someone to kick someone when they're down because that's the only time or ever you can generate that kind of power because if you really think about it like everything else, you've got to kind of teach your foot to do this.

Speaker 2:          00:18:29       Yeah, you got to teach your body to do this. You teach yourself. But this kid does that. Everybody's talking about the Charlie Brown. Charlie Brown from like one foot away and just fucked [inaudible] head. He really, everybody can do that. Jamie brings Brandon verb first of all we can somebody anyways. It looks like a video game cause he used to be flat. It was flat. No Saginaw Street fighter. Street fighter. Definitely eating a lot of steak. Yes. What do you think? He's like two two 40 maybe. Boom and that's just one. That's just one look at this was a y. Oh Jesus. But this one is a bad, that's just one. There's another one when he's head kicking the guy while the guys down, it just sucked. He was like the first real like a big time athlete that I remember. But some people think that this is a better way to express fighting because this is realistic, like disagree back the head head.

Speaker 2:          00:19:35       I like Eddie guys are steady, loves that shit too. Barbaric man. I would like to see headbutts bring, oh this fight is over. That's Cam boot train rounds. We're not even paying attention. It's fighter. Oh, we're watching an extraneous fights. This is when people get mad. No one called attention to these fights. The good fight. This is actually a really good fight. And you know, UFC fight pass is working on getting this league that, I think it's in Burma where uh, you just wrap your hands. It's Muy Thai kickboxing with headbutts. Yeah. Legal. What is it called? Leche way. How'd he say it? Yeah, it's like, it's called let, let, let, let way that way or something like that way. I think that word [inaudible] crazy with them in front of the ropes on their hands. They wrap their hands up with something. I'm not sure what, I'm barely headbutts or legal holy show. Frank Grillo in a fight world, went to Cambodia and lived with them and study with them and they, the problem is they don't have ice in Cambodia. They're so poor. So when they get hit in the face and stuff there, they just stay swollen. So between rounds left way and that's why, wonder how they search. I wonder how you pronounce the shots, elbows nd it against the ropes. Boom. Just do, just drop. And Are you

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       allowed hit to the back of the head? You can do ever. I'm not sure about that. You Know Eddie and I've talked about this a hundred times, but it's, it's an important fact that when you watch head kicks, there's a lot of the time head kicks are lending to the back of the head. Like you say, you can't hit someone in the back of the head, right? It's not supposed to be legal. If I go over your shoulder and I kick you kick in, the back seats are Nestor who pseudo. So two punches. This guy at turn, it hits him, right my fucking back. Then bring up, bring up and there's nothing you can do. Bring up Ernesto host when he hits a Maurice Greene myth. And Maury Smith. Yeah Dude. He wrapped his head around your fucking head and his neck just goes around your head. His neck.

Speaker 1:          00:21:27       Just why? Oh, that was um, that was tough. I was good friends with Maurice when that was going on. Maurice was, was fighting when, you know, he probably shouldn't have been done doing the demos finest Ernesto host is, you know, but I mean he was fighting like pro kickbox and what he's also doing MMA and like Maurice is a worldclass kickboxer but I really think for you to fight a guy like Ernesto hoost, you kind of have to be kickbox and all the time and we'll see what he does. Yeah. And Maurice like for real was a super skilled world champion. Kickboxer but he had been doing, oh my God. How do you look at that? He lifts his watch. This dude, he was so good. It's perfect. Numbers. Fights against Bob Sapp. Yeah, Dude. His fucking leg kicks man. They're the best at the way he punches though.

Speaker 1:          00:22:18       Yeah, he bought, he did everything awesome. The thing about him didn't you know. Here's another one. Look at him now. Look it. He looks like a super fight. A game too, right? Doesn't he look like some kind of video game character in these images? Well then show to him early in his career he was a bag of bones man. Really? Yeah, he was skinny. What do you think your diet for real? He was real thin. He was very long and almost like style bender like great. Then he got Super Jack later in the cro cop dude, his leg kicks were sensational. How about with Bob? Sat beat him twice. That was a real fight. Fuck you. That feels real to me. To add pop SAP is a giant human being. [inaudible] 75 it's a lot of fights. He's right. It bumps up out the fuck up shoulder.

Speaker 1:          00:23:08       Was it Ernesto? I don't remember. They kept hitting it and that's what stopped the fight. No, no, no, no, no. That was a different fight. I think you're thinking of a different phone. I'm not. One of them had a really fucked up shoulder and he kept kicking it and he was like, Nesto kip king. He was like, no, no, no. Pretty sure that's Bob had to be one that he lost because he won the two fights that he had against her Nesto that I'm aware of. Box I did, didn't he? Eddie pops have beat her Nesto yeah. I told her I don't remember the second fight or if they even fought twice or three times. I guess I just remember Bob up beating him. Do you know when you really think about it, man? You know Maury Smith worked with Bob Sapp as well, taught him a lot about kickboxing, but when

Speaker 2:          00:23:45       you think about it more, Reese was like the first real high level kickboxer to become successful at MMA. Yup. Right. The first world champion, when you remember when he fought Conan Silvera and head kicked him, everybody was like, you can't beat a Brazilian jujitsu black belt. You're definitely not going to beat him. And by Coleman Coleman Dude, and he was so as I we were at. That's why it's against, right. We were there together. God Damn. I remember being so 1996 the shit, right? 96 97 I think it was 97 97 it might have even been [inaudible] 98 he kept saying, come on, come on, come on. Who's come on mark. How many come granted pounding and you saw and you saw it. Mark at one point got kicked one too many times. It's just wet stopped and everybody went, oh, you know he's like down Maury Smith. A couple of terms.

Speaker 2:          00:24:34       Problem was Maury Smith has a very good defensive guard, high level recovery and like he doesn't really attack cardio. He's also working with you work with Frank Shamrock, first friends with shamrock. He was also an easy two 30 like just a natural Django land. He actually played locked down too. Yeah. Yeah, he did. Yeah. Look, Maury Smith is a smart guy and his, his kickboxing was so high level man when he started fighting these MMA fighters and they realized that he could defend himself off of his back, but if you're standing up with him, you're just fucked man. Yeah. The problem was Mark Coleman wasn't never really worked on is guard passing back then. You know what I mean? He just, he just assumed that when you take someone down, you just get on top of them and beat the shit out of him. But that's true if you don't have any kind of card.

Speaker 2:          00:25:26       But Maurice Smith had a professional defensive guard. Yeah. Yeah. And also this is the headbutt days. I was headbutt days. Yeah. Yeah. When I don't think they feel different. They aren't gloves. You would over hook here. They has loves, right? Oh yeah, they definitely had kick. Do you remember the gut, the guard, the most important guard position when there's headbutts are allowed? Grabbed, grabbed the back of the head? No. Did he won when I've got sidekick or the fully straight to the gut. Damn. He's a nice man. He's got some great fights in the UFC. Man. John Jones dropped Vito Belfort with the front leg side kick one off, some amazing, I'd never seen that. It was a front leg side kick. One of the most underrated kicks. People just don't do it that good. Do you think v two or bell force cage side tonight with chucked him, rushes the cage and says, uh, I wouldn't fight both you pussies, but he's just fucking juice to the gills.

Speaker 2:          00:26:22       And we're like, yeah, it probably will happen. They'd let them if the UFC let them go over there, if they load the right, I've been Dana. Well it and they'll put, they'll have him too, you know, if they just got to regulate medications, make sure that everything's okay. Come on. I mean if they're testing chuck and Tito, you gotta Test v Torque ticket. Can't beat your campaign. Kelly, let's not do that. Okay, well it's only having five and like, let's get me on an Indian reservation. It was this, I don't want anyone 70 what's happening? Yeah. Is a lightweight one seven years, dude. How about Walter? Wherever Hudson Nibia virtue. Neil magnesium and he looked really, maybe it was a real problem. He looks really good. Good man. He looks really good. Maggie, I don't know if it's the jet lag or why he's my boy, but he was a late start and he had eight the fuck up.

Speaker 2:          00:27:11       Yeah. He got chewed up. You got chewed up, poked in the eye like early in the first round. Then he just couldn't decide like depth. He had no idea what to do. So he's just always like waiting room. That's a real problem. And you know they, there is a solution in the works. I can't talk about it. I'm a proxy. I pokes goggles. Yeah, no they fell. It's there. But I have a better glove design that they're working on it. But someone said to try and kick, oh hands dude. I also heard they're doing something about a room or is the super room right star anything. You saw it in 2009 I'd be like permanently, really boom, leave that side kick to the body and then nasty left hands. You mean they might get rid of you sat and we're back to old days. It's crazy. I don't know if they were getting rid of it. Maybe a little.

Speaker 2:          00:28:04       That is so crazy. Sidekick to the body, but especially the way he threw it. I mean he really got his weight behind it. You could fuck people up with that man set of lips on them. It's like we all accept that the front leg side or the turning side kick or spinning back kick, we all accept that puts people out. Right. Well how much harder is you're turning side kicked in your front leg side kick way harder. Yeah, but significantly. But how much does it take really to make your body cave in? Because my front leg, sorry, is way harder than my left hook. Way Harder. Your front foot front lakeside. Really? So yeah. So if you, if you think like of course you can left, took someone in the body and dropped them and fuck them up bad, he hit him and liver. Right?

Speaker 2:          00:28:45       Well why wouldn't you to think that you could do that also with the front leg side kick on a regular basis. Yeah. He's got to have a quicker snap to it takes what most a long time to develop. That's the prize it takes. You got to develop that quick snap and that's what most guys are missing. Most guys that comes out to slow the body, the body's about is more designed for I left hook that you can keep the power and yet I fuck probably till you're in your sixties versus from from Thai kick is an athletic move. Touch the state is definitely no headway to kick that much. No. Well it's really definitely a con a little bit but not like great is some fit kit is a good kicker. Yeah. Yeah. But nothing like crazy. No, nothing like a cro cop type character.

Speaker 2:          00:29:24       Huh? There's no one in the, uh, there's no one in the UFC for the big guys. There's really not. That's a kicker. Who else? Well, this must be someone we're not thinking of. Marcin Tibora kicks a lot, but he's not like a stadium kids. Not like a heavyweight. Barboza there's no like just monster with the kids. Yeah. I was hoping that was going to be a something we would acquire it. Right. Like get some sort of Rico Verhoeven type character. Yeah. Kathy's fighting MMA and he's trained at Aka well listen, standup wise for, he's on not just one level but so many levels above most people in MMA. Rachel for Hoover in, it's a mine as far as strict up, but that doesn't always tremble. It doesn't translate now. It doesn't translate. You gotta have you gotta like the distance is different. The timing, your stance. Verhoeven is something special.

Speaker 2:          00:30:15       And he's a, he's a big giant guy. Have you ever seen right now crazy because he had obviously a Dutch guy, giant milk fed Dejak Sadie. Really? Yeah, he's uh, he's about 240 plus pounds and the guy has mad cardio. It's one of the crazy things about him. He puts a crazy pace on these guys and he's a striker. Have you seen some of his MMA fights? No. Who the fuck is finding that poor soul? I mean, he just area have mercy. You want some of that be fuck is going on. So I'm like, yeah, see if you can find out. Oh, I mean I'd use, I'd have to use my kicks dude. And he's like, hey, hey, be, and he's got an AK training with DC. Hey guys, I've sparked. Oh Bro, what the fuck are you showing us, Jamie?

Speaker 2:          00:30:59       Don't put it out by three is boy, he's like a giant Dutchman to try and find a highlight reel. Final highlight reel. Wow. He's a monster dude. Oh my Lord. And great hair too. And he's a young guy who's fine. I mean, I don't even know if all behind that survived two beats of the best in the world. If all the guy, nothing. You guys not having big contract, my uncle now you can take a beating. Now that big guy is supposed to be super tough for sure. It looks at people like that kind of shit. You know, it's like oof capable of when big Roy wins by knockout. They trust. Yes, they do look at that and it weird like I must do fucking tons of cardio, but he just, the gut just stay. Just ate the wrong food, Bro. Look at that fucking Combo.

Speaker 2:          00:31:44       But look at his kicks man. I mean Ricoh over who don't go to go to his MMA fight. Some guy gets fucking starched and you, you can't, he's not finding experienced, wait, wait, what are you doing? What are you doing? Who's running this shit? Then you can't listen. I'm all over the place. Jamie kicks herself. You want to try to watch some of this stuff? Knees kicks. Oh, Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is right. How old is he? I don't even think he's 30 17 boom. He's 15 years old. If I had no, he's Dutch. 15 if I had to guess, I would say he's like 29 how old is he? Stays in his thirties yep. Can't check it. That's it. The tallest people in the world, right? They're the biggest people in the world in general. Are they the giant people? I don't know if they're the biggest people in the world, but they add heard.

Speaker 2:          00:32:30       They're the tallest people in the world. Dude, I'd love to see him and Alistair Overeem. Go on a big boy. I wish she would take them down for sure. The officers are very good grappling that Alister would definitely stand up with them for a little bit, for sure. Which is what he does, but he would uh, take them down. Alster very underrated grappler. Oh, amazing grappler. Yeah. And it's grounded. Pam will fuck you up. It's a real problem. It's used. Don't feel as guilty for a little bit. Yeah. And it's also, he's just had so many more MMA fights deciding for a hundred years. Yeah. He's good at everything. But Verhoeven was it. He has it. He has an advantage over basically everything. Now in heavyweight, Saki has that smooth bill too, where you just like, you know what? Oh my God, I get it. But what's interesting is Saki, what is he fighting?

Speaker 2:          00:33:16       One 85 in the UFC. Yeah, but you should be at one 80 fiber. Yeah, that's, yeah. That's what it is, right? Yeah. He should be finding five. What's that bro? 29 29 years old. 29 years old. He in the UFC yet or no, no, no. He's making his way through, you know, smaller organizations was, so show me one of his MMA fights. Holy Shit. He fights on her ma. Yes Bro. Some poor soul whose fighting him? Rico. Rico. Verhoeven. Verhoeven is a real problem and he's training with Cain and what? DEVINCI heavyweight. Why every bit of huge dude. I mean he's like six, four. You better get that Jujitsu. He's about six [inaudible] four. He's a big boy. Big Boy. Big Boy. And two 40 jacked. Don't let this go a natural shape. Maybe. Yeah, maybe not. Yeah, maybe. Right. Maybe Stryker's come. It's wait and see what happens at Jujitsu together. Oh, for sure. Right? Yeah. What do you think is happening? Uh, again, Broomer on super dark web. Rumor is that, uh, there's gonna be a change with Usada moving forward a little bit. Is this him, Jamie and this video, the other video. Oh Shit. He took the guy down. Nice. Maybe he's good at Jujitsu. He's an athlete. Holy Shit. All the body. Oh Shit. Did you do not want that guy on top of you growing up? County looks like in here. It looks like, who knows? Maybe he's really good on the ground. Show me that again, Jamie. Show me the beginning part of it again. This has been a while ago. If done inside MMA.

Speaker 3:          00:34:55       Cool. I feel like

Speaker 2:          00:34:56       he's still doing that high cover up. What's your obviously worked though, man. He had to take the dude down. Yeah, that was a wild little exchange. I mean that dude did not, uh, I mean they came to throw at each other. They, that guy was not avoiding them. I like how he's punching the records from the mail. Oh, does that fighty starch so hard man. He could hit you said whenever you get a real striker on top of, you know, that's, it actually could turned their hips. The forest. Do you remember when a cro cop got on top of Gabriel Gonzaga? The rematch. The revenge fight. Elbows smashed him with elbows. They were horrific. Horrific. And then who did dank? Gabriel got good with elbows from the bottom. Didn't he fuck somebody up from the bottom? Look in, look at the euro February in his corner there.

Speaker 2:          00:35:46       Here it is. This is, this is more, more. It's the same one or the video is more recent. This is Rico Verhoeven. This looks like the same fight, isn't it? I think different than how many have you had? Is it Jane? That looks like the sense of I don't how it'd be done. This is the same. Yes. I've got it for a kickboxer not bad passing. Yeah. I mean he's got to learn, right? Hi. He's also smart. So like what got him to become an elite kickboxer that kind of intelligence as well as hard work. He's just going to translate that to MMA. He's just got to make sure that he fixes the holes in his game. Is that the right king of risk? And he likes to tease out the right Kay Kay with the wrestlers. Like these are hard fucking punches, man. Get this clean and room for your body. Just lifting a leg up. I think only one time ever. Maybe twice have some, someone got knocked out. Wow. There were a while there were mounting somebody from the bottom. Really? You're saying the guy on mount got knocked up, somebody catches up. Yeah. It's happened maybe twice in Paris. I want to keep getting knocked out while you're being mounted. I mean, not while you're mounted. Sorry. Excuse me. I think Duane Ludwig and when did it, wasn't that something that

Speaker 3:          00:37:01       who

Speaker 2:          00:37:04       it happened in? In Japan? Yeah. Oh Man. I'm trying to remember this. Hello? Dwayne load weights. Fight. Yeah. Why don't I feel like Duane Ludwig Dude. Oh, Eve Edwards. Duane Ludwig did it to eve Edwards. He heard him like really bad and eve like covered it up and he was, yeah, he was on top and Dwayne punched or from the bottom and hurt them really bad. He talked about it on the podcast. Now I remember, dude, how long has this fight taken to dear to this point? What's going on here? You feel like, well, they're a, they're in China, so we're there at, maybe they're just giving us chance to settle in. Isn't it weird though, isn't just China's Communist, right? That's not really, not really. No, not really. We're a capitalist country there. Are there a command economy though? Like so where a lot of the decisions are made by the poet bureau, by the, by the actual government, and then from there their flag looks like the Soviet Union flag.

Speaker 2:          00:37:59       Yeah. Well if Chad, it's still red China, right. It was, there was a communist revolution. Not Anymore though. It's weird. That is, it's not dang shop democracy right now. You know when I went to new Asian, uh, for Abu Dhabi and in the hotels, boom, they have the TV on with the, with the propaganda. Oh yeah. How long ago? Your tone talking shit on the United States. Really? Yeah. There it's a documentary that's on, you know, it's the default setting on your TVs and in Beijing. Fuck them. Get there. You sit down to watch TV and a documentary on how bad the United is is playing. This

Speaker 4:          00:38:36       is, this is why we're doing what we're doing. Look at the amount of Shelby Cobra. The United States is uh, you know, they're just going down, down the list of all the, the things that the United States does that uh, when you go there for mental to society, did you have to do your fingerprints on the machine? You have to get, you get all your fingerprints are recorded and then you're given, at least when I was shooting a movie, you were given a our adjuster, right? Yeah. You were given a memo to say if you and no political dissent, like you will not voice your political point of view of it's contrary to the government's live. I don't know why. If you do that, you'll be asked to leave. Or You could be some American kid like try and steal something. Oh yeah. That was balls. A son [inaudible] son, Ucla basketball teams stole like some sunglasses and fucking Trump had to help get them out.

Speaker 4:          00:39:23       They don't fuck around Chinese super fucked. Ooh. But Dang shall Pang said famously to be rich is glorious, which was so contrary to the communist metallurgical. It's cool as fuck the UFC in there, so it can't be that. It's a huge market. Everybody wants the Chinese market. Well, that's the next big push for the UFC. Right? I mean internationally, they're growing like you're not getting Google. You know when we tried, well you'd have to keep trying to find servers that would, that would provide Google and the Internet in China because they can't get you to the access of everything. Yes. And then they find you and they shut that down. And then you've got to find another one. So anybody who worked on the set, who anybody worked on a set couldn't get w you're given a phone there. So when I was an actor, I was given a phone with WeChat.

Speaker 4:          00:40:05       Fine. It's a phone issue to me that I can use there. I can't use technically my phone and link into the worldwide web. Too many firewalls. Yeah, they you, and then by the way, if you want to use your phone, you download something called Wechat, which is an APP which you know, is controlled by somebody. So it's, there's a lot of group think there's zero, there's zero descent. And if you say something derogatory about the government's appear like the, and something like Weechat, they probably monitor it. Jesus, man, fuck. They Monitor. But of course they monitor. Of course they do. You didn't text me. It's an amazing example of how you can control a lot of people. But you know in north North Korea you don't even, there is no Internet, correct? No, no, it's good. They get no internet, no TV channels. I talked to a friend of mine works for the government and his wife works for the government too and they had to go to Russia for something and he said they were, you were told just absolutely think you're being followed everywhere you go.

Speaker 4:          00:41:06       Assumed they're listening to every word you say. Assume that your, your hotel rooms bugged. Yup. And then where you go, you're being followed. It's all right. It's kind of like the states. More evidence we chat is recording private messages for Beijing to spy on users. Did you even use the phone? Really be not real. You text me every now and then. Tell me how bad is happening already for a while. Don't we already know that? They're like, yeah, everything that's just confirmed like that, it just freaks people out as well. It should, but you know, we're, we're just, we, we forgot how this is. Why freedom of expression and freedom of speech in this country is so important because while this is happening here in the United States and and freedom of speech is, you know, something that it, it gets up for debate sometimes. It's like who gets to decide?

Speaker 4:          00:41:55       Who gets to say this and gets to say that and what should we stop? The problem with any kind of censorship is right. While we're here being able to talk shit on the podcast, there are a big giant spots of the world filled with billions of people that can't do this. If they did this, they would get arrested. Locked up. That's exactly right. Deja Vu. China Theater. We did podcasts the way we do podcasts. No fucking chance. The Arab world, I mean one of the things that will come out my legs and in the United Arab Emirates and Qatar and what, what, what's come out is that these governments are saying these, these, the, the royal family and the people that are in power, they go, well, there's political dissent. So you've got journalists or people have formed groups at for say, let's say democracy or elections, and guess what?

Speaker 4:          00:42:43       Uh, they hire American mercenaries. It was just a whole article, blackwater dude, guys like that. They find hire American horse needs to take care of their terrorist problem and they're terrorist problem that they get. As long as the American company gets issued weaponry and orders from the standing army, then they can do whatever they want to use this. And so this all came, who was the article I just read? It was fascinating. It was a New York Times, but it was just exposed where there were these ex Badass special forces guys making a fortune, essentially acting as mercenaries in countries like the United Arab Emirates, et Cetera, to get rid of their terrorist problem. Now that's the royal family saying it's a terrorist problem when it could very well be just a political group, but they're getting killed. It's terrible. So, you know, but the bigger issue in this country is apparently from what I'm seeing in my own experience is that when you put a certain ad on Facebook and Facebook decides to, that ad might be offensive to someone.

Speaker 4:          00:43:41       My count just got flagged. Yeah. Uh, okay. And so even if you say get in the best shape of your life or whatever it might be, that might make other people feel uncomfortable for whatever reason, it's either a Bot, an algorithm or somebody is flagging that ad or shutting down your account. And I know a number of people that that's happened too. Huh? So what the fuck is going on there? But, but you know also too is if, let's say you do an ad or you do a post on Instagram, let's see, you have 2 million followers on how many you have. Let's see, you have 60 million and you do a post, you know, they limit to how many people that reach is now you have to pay extra to make sure it reads the Gaa. People Facebook. Cause that's when those up to, so I says promote your posts. Like why I fucking sick. That's why. Yeah. That seems like a business model, but hold on, but is it here? Yeah, it's kind of smart.

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       Yeah. Right person, let's say it's more, doesn't mean it's not fucked up. One of those fitness people that grow their Instagram by just putting ass. Very not. There's dudes too. There's guys that I followed that are just like super jacked and they're doing like one arm chin ups and Shit and you fall flips. Yeah. Following fitness, dude, settle down, man. Take it. He's comfortable. They're always in a gym where they can work out shirtless shot, right. Everyone's shirtless, but they're doing an impressive shit. There's like a bunch of them that I follow them. Okay, but where are you sitting on my point? You made me nervous having know about posts, man. They'll reach all these extra people there. Their thing will grow, their business will grow. I'm a man that I'm a fan of that what? I'm not a fan of investment. Why would I have a question about is is there a, some buddy in charge of what's, what's permissible and what's not according to a certain code of conduct and do they have a political agenda?

Speaker 1:          00:45:24       So in other words, so if I put out something that has profanity or maybe I'll stand up clip where I want to get people in, it's, it's a clip that is offensive to said person touch possibilities. They can go, nope. Flag stopping them from doing that. Well, but see with uh, with the dudes with their shirts off flex and shit, when they're trying to get clients, that's fine. And they can promote, reach other people outside their followers isn't what it should be. But if you have 100,000 followers, it should reach all hundred thousand. That's what's crazy to me. Yeah. They're going to lose everybody. There's going to be a new Instagram. If they started doing that shit and he gets out of hand, people just leave. Well there's, you know, it's shadow banning is right know there's a concept of shadow banning and I don't know if this is, Jamie would be able to speak to this better than me. Is that ever been proved that they actually do shadow ban people? What's that? Or is that it's they used is that if you say we're on Twitter and maybe you were conservative and you said a lot of rude things about liberals that maybe they would decide that although it doesn't violate the terms of service, what you do is, uh, makes them uncomfortable. They make a moral judgment and they decide to limit your engaged match. I'm talking about, yeah, this is somehow possible. Possible. Right. Or is that like a hater?

Speaker 2:          00:46:40       It's up in what you're saying with the paying of, of post to, it happens similarly there too. If you were at an account that never paid. Yeah. And once you pay, once you give him five bucks, you're, you're like flag now as an account that will pay and changing the game on Twitter. It's Twitter. You don't cross the board. Yeah. You can pay on Twitter too. How do you pay on Twitter? Do you pay on Twitter? You don't have to, but the option you can pay. Yeah, promoted tweets. It's a promoted tweet. The top trending topic for the last year or two is a paid, it says paid or promoted. Yeah. You just have to go into it because they get money now. That's how they're banned from Twitter. A lot of people, man, really management's been banned from Twitter and more conservatives, conservatives,

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       but liberals like Ben to do, liberals that are put out death threats, they'd been banned. But general you get should be lopsided. You don't know. That's a good question. We should find out what is the, what is the suffering should be banned? The backing band. That's a good question too. Is it to incite violence? The violate their terms of service and definitely if you incite violence, that's definitely a no, no racial slurs or no, no racist. Fuckhead you can call someone a fuck head, but you can't call him like a Guinea fuckhead. Yeah. There's like, there's certain things you can say in certain things you can't say, but it's a lot of, it's subjective. Yeah. But then some of it's pretty black and white. Like if you're like, man, I want to go so much a blow up that fucking school. Fuck those cards. Of course.

Speaker 1:          00:48:17       Where the racist stuff. Yeah. Yes. All of that. I think you got to regulate the hate to, if it's just bullying and shit like that, just ban them. Wow. It's like, here's the question and this is who gets to decide who was hateful and what's not, and then the problem is they keep pushing it further and further and further and then even just insults or hateful. Even even like this guy who's a dumb ass. Yeah, that's hateful. Saying someone's a dumb ass. It's hateful. I mean they're kind of, there's only so far you can, you could keep going down that road, right? You want to make sure that you have free expression and you don't get free expression. If you banned people from saying things that just don't seem that bad to me. Looks Jones, you think his banning would like to see what he says.

Speaker 1:          00:49:04       Sandy Hook stuff it sandy, but see, but here's the thing. Getting sued for that. Anyway. Here's the thing. Yeah. He was already getting sued for that. Like what did he say that got them? I think something happened that he did had nothing to do with even what he said. He confronted them at some event, right? And he was yelling in the back. And that happened after he confronted people in Congress and he's got a bus. Alex Jones has a regular on a former CIA officer, Dr Steve [inaudible]. He has them on like once every six months. That's where he got the sandy hook information was from him. That dude is on volume as a CIA guy know about sandy hook. The fuck would he know that's the dumbest fucking thing that Alex Jones has ever done. It's also a moral and there's parents, fuck, fuck that guy. Fuck of whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:49:53       If he said it didn't fuck him too, you have to always wonder and you would you, I mean, I'm not making any accusations, but you'd have to always wonder when you hear a story like that, why would someone say something so ridiculous? And why would someone tried to convince someone like Alex Jones of something so ridiculous? And I think there'd be two reasons. One to discredit Jones. If you could talk him into repeating what you said, if you think he's willing to do, that's interesting. You can easily discredit him and it would be a really good way to do it. Like the best way to do it. That's what I'm saying, whether he's right or wrong, but

Speaker 4:          00:50:28       whether he's right or wrong several times on the show. So, but he's started Alex for Alex to believe him. No, it's not that crazy. He's hearing it from a guy who was in the CIA started like this. It's not that crazy for him to believe in a guide from, you know, he may or may not be right. But it started with Alex actually saying, uh, uh, he said, unfortunately he goes something to the effect of I saw it, it was very sad. And then, but unfortunately I've seen a lot of soap operas and I've seen a lot of, and, and, and I know an actor when I see one and that's where it started with him. Yes. And he's being, he's being sued by, he bought a farm in Connecticut and he's in trouble. Be Good acting coach, but remembering chosen activities. He was me in court and they said, what the fuck?

Speaker 4:          00:51:13       Basically what the fuck you're doing? He goes, listen, I say a lot of things just for, for entertainment of course, like it's just for the during. Is that his trial with his wife? But he did admit, he's like, uh, I don't believe it. A lot of it. I just say he's got a business. Yeah. Well that's the thing about all a lot of nutrition people and he's right. A lot of these people is you make money. You make money in this, in this business, and whether what or whatever it is, whether it's being a political pundit, whether it's on an exercise guy, you make money having answers. If you're somebody who's more scientific and says, I dunno, it depends. Maybe you're not going to make money. When you say bone broth cures cancer, you're going to sell books. When you say, uh, my plant based Diet is proven to do blah, blah, blah, whatever, you're going to make money.

Speaker 4:          00:51:58       If you say, I'm going to, I'll help you lose weight and keep it off in four months, you're not going to say, Hey, I'm a nutritionist guy. It's going to take you two years. We're going to try to change how you're going to have bounce backs are going to have plateaus and being realistic. Yeah. Nobody's going to buy that shit. Just you're Dong guy has all movement, man. So, but with, uh, with Alex Jones, so is he banned for life or business? I don't know. Well, I mean, he's still has his website. He's got a big loss to just kind of worry about, but it shows they got rid of his show helping all the farmers and shit. No, the only thing that had happened is they pulled him off of youtube and they pulled him off of Twitter and Facebook to an iTunes and iTunes and he's got a major lawsuit with a walker and that doesn't compromise.

Speaker 4:          00:52:41       There's tears. There's two guys, there's two guys that are being sued over that. Uh, Alex Jones and a guy named a wolf gang. Helbig great. He's also, he's also being sued, that guy, his job was to prepare schools for school shootings. So he came out and he started saying that too. So He's, he's breaking apart. He started saying that he's getting, he's getting sued along with Alex Jones. Oh my God. Well, but they didn't show up for when you went to court. They'd never showed up. So they dropped the case. What about one thing about the La law, it's kind of weird now that they're the parents. Why would sandy hook be fake? Let's not talk about this stuff. Oh, I dunno. I find it fascinating.

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       Well, why in the world would it be faked be, I know you get riled up. Like what's the conspiracy theories? Zero zero thoughts that it, that it's fake. But I do have thoughts on why someone would try to get other people to say it's fake. And this, if there's any, does anything that's ever going to convince you that conspiracy theories are stupid? It's making up a fake conspiracy easily. Provable, fake conspiracy about a real tragedy. That's a nice, simple psychological way to discredit people. If I thought you were a dumb ass but you had a big voice, I might talk you into saying some shit about something that's not real and have you convinced it's real. So you spout it out, you look a moron, right? And that discredits everything else you said. It's right. And you have to be really careful with a lot of these stories.

Speaker 1:          00:54:12       There's a lot of these, these conspiracy theories that literally start out a joke. They start out in four Chan and a lot of these chat rooms as trolls and then before you know it, it becomes a real thing cause his head over and as I said over and over again, and then morons get ahold of. But it's true though, right? Like he's a smart, we can all agree he's a, I don't agree. What do you mean is you don't think he's, I don't know to do what he's doing. Listen, I don't ever talk about stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:54:39       No, you would not say he's a dumb person. I don't know. I can't speak for you. I take it, yeah, he's not stupid. It's, I'm very, very sad that he said that Sandy Hook isn't real, but I fuck with them. But I always enjoy being around that guy. You would say he's articulate smart guy. Right? I see he's a fun guy to yeah, so I'm just saying for him to, it's not like you can just honey dick and back dude. Sandy Hook. Like it would have to be something you need. Loves conspiracies, man. You know, he really does. And this is the problem with someone who likes hunts out conspiracies. You're going to love them. You're gonna, you're gonna look for them. Numerology and the Bible. You can find any pattern. This is the problem is when you have a vested interest in them being real, when it's your business, because there are a lot of them that are real.

Speaker 1:          00:55:25       So the problem is if you have a vested interest in them being real and you exclude information that would point to them not being real and you use confirmation bias and you fuck up and then you try to convince other people that you're correct. This is something that people will fall down. I'd love to hear you super quiet about all this, but if you're a conspiracy theory, which ones have been proven correct? Oh, that many, right? There's plenty like, absolutely. There's big ones like Enron, you know there's big ones. There's big ones. You know, there's a many documentaries and books have been written on the Enron conspiracy. These guys got together and they figured out how to make a kajillion dollars and fuck people over. And it was, it was, it was breaking the law and they knew it was breaking the law. They can aspire to do it and by mediums and forums so you can take, take them. There's wise people to think the 2008 hires, housing crisis, that that was the, that was all on purpose and these guys built this bubble up and sank it. Proven though it's not proven. It's not proven. The

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       bubble, the housing bubble was, they've been great books written on a basketball with Michael Lewis's book. The big short is a good book on it. Good. Yeah. But they, you know, there, there's been a lot of research on that. Too many banks. Is there any approval? One turn all that is all it all depends. Brennan describes, no, not at all. No. And he knows his shit. It all depends on how much circumstantial evidence, uh, makes you throw up some red flags. Like some people they just don't see the red flags and some people are red flags go up right away. So it all depends. Like when you say is there any proof? Well, um, you don't need a, I mean at, at us, at a certain point when you have circumstantial evidence, at a certain point it adds up. You know, you know, if, if, um, one case pretty suspect JFK suspect is fuck super, there's no book, Jeff K's a perfect example, right?

Speaker 4:          00:57:16       Yeah. There's no actual proof of the conspiracy that there was, uh, you know, multiple shooters or the CIA and the mob. There's no actual proof, but there's a lot of circumstantial evidence as well. So it all depends on, it all depends on how much circumstantial evidence do you need for any particular conspiracy theory where you go, Oh shit, there's enough circumstantial evidence. Like, if there was a murder, right, and you were being accused and only one person said, you know, I saw Brendan like four blocks away from the restaurant where his friend was killed. If just that one person, sorry, that's one piece of circumstantial evidence. That's not enough to convict you. But if a hundred people said they saw you two blocks away in the parking lot, none of it alone, none of it's standing alone will put you in jail. But at a certain point, enough circumstantial evidence, we'll put dudes in jail.

Speaker 4:          00:58:05       Or if enough people tell the same story about you with Cosby, it was the same story over and over. It's like not all of these women can't be there all telling the exact same story about the same Emma Jackson. Well, not only that caused me, had gone to court and had a lawsuit sealed. Right. And paid a woman off. That's right. I get it. Already been done. So that, yeah, so this was a part of the whole thing was that he had to come out and uh, you know the, the headed defend that in his most recent trial Bill Clinton too. I just got done watching those Monica Lewinsky tapes. Yeah. Bill Clinton was a freak. Oh yeah dude. The other problem with like being like Alex Jones who makes a lot of money, office conspiracies and things is that once he said something, I know a pretty good fan of his Alex.

Speaker 4:          00:58:46       And um, what the problem is once you say something and you have that big of a following, right? So let's just say you float out of conspiracy, but then you look at evidence, you start to realize, maybe I overstepped my bounds, we all say things we wish we had and our, we all say things. But now you've got a whole movement behind what you said now to try to pull back would turn that 25% of the whoever it is against you and that can be a liability to two. So one of the things about being a public figure as you can say something, and if you're selling product and sell on your show on that, you better be all in. You've gotta stay all in. Yeah. So you become a prisoner to your own kind of first impulse or own first. Sort

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       of like a matter of how it, well, it's, especially if he's also an entertainer. It's also

Speaker 1:          00:59:26       this rush to say you'd know something when you don't know it. Yeah. There's a rush to say there's a rush to say we, we absolutely know this happened. We absolutely know that happened.

Speaker 2:          00:59:38       Attainment. They're getting it from somewhere. He has his sources. She's got information on on these, on these, you know, these tragic events or something like that. Or you don't think there'll be, I just looking at me and Brandon, listen, I think he has some people that sell drones. No, I'm not. Don't take the bait. And Eddie, he's floating a fucking huge worm out. Hey, listen, come on the show and try not to talk about conspiracy theories, but I always get sucked back into the, I always get sucked back to he spoke that word. No, look, look, he's, they're legit question. I don't know. You're asking super crazy legit questions. You're asking, you're asking detection. Someone that someone, you know with one eye opened up, kind of like,

Speaker 1:          01:00:31       okay,

Speaker 2:          01:00:31       Hey Brian, so I'm not bringing up, let's talk about tidies it say no more fam. I was biting my tongue just like, I'm not asking you to go down the crazy, you know, and Telsia cause I'm just saying, how do you get there? You know what I'm saying? So he has his black belt in conspiracy theories. Bryan, you know, he just never brides in say that there are no black belts and conspiracy theories. Alex Jones says, hold my beer. And it was quick. All right, now the gone where we're waiting. What is this hot field sign?

Speaker 1:          01:01:11       Joe's Camaros, man. Ooh, that's his fight. I love this has been gone for a hot second, right? It was this last one, Damien Maia, I believe. Think so. And that was a bad one, man. I did not like the way they pulled him off of mines back. That made me angry. I might have that. He was standing up and wrapped around the referees, separated them, and I was like, what are you doing? Do you know how hard it is for him to get to that position and the best grappler on fucking plan? What are you doing as a bat? He's a really good spot. They're both pretty dry. [inaudible] energy. Yeah, some bullshit bullshit. Damien Maia. Well, it's fucked up, man. It's like that is fighting. Okay. He's fighting right now. Just because it's not exciting enough.

Speaker 1:          01:01:56       No, they're fighting you. Fuck. This is what they're doing. The grammy, me people that freak out about it like you. You got to. Just because it's so exciting when it's good. They want it to be exciting all the time, but it can't be, there's going to be fights where to to fight correctly. They have to fight in a way that's not as entertainment. It's not as entertaining, but it's the right way to fight, but you can't sleep. You can't find the right way. Exactly. You can't not fight the right way just because it's more interesting for people that don't understand what's, how you become a 500 fighters. You when one punishment we should take. It's just not the way to fight. You never gets the bow ever, ever. Or if you do, you don't keep it. It's very rare. Who sponsor a beast? Man. Super tough.

Speaker 1:          01:02:41       Super strong guy like wrestling fighting today. No, I wish. No, it's fine. Dos Anjos though. That's a great fight. It's heavy man. That's a heavy fight. Design. Just have to 70 just became a fucking beef. Yeah, but he didn't look that good against um, uh, our boy Colby Covington. No, Colby put on that pressure. That crazy pills. Colby beat his ass, but now they announced Colby Woodley. Of course you have to have that. That's the fight. I don't, Woodley doesn't want to have it because he's probably angry at the dude. Dude. I wish I had done Colby. Ben Ask him. You're going to see angry Tyron Woodley versus Colby Covington. That's going to be very interesting. Angry. I want to fuck you up. Tyron Woodley. What'd they say? Nightmare. Nightmare. Think about the fucking guys he's fought recently, whether it's Darren tail or Thompson. Both guys known to be really high level strikers.

Speaker 1:          01:03:36       He dropped both those guys didn't hit him. Oh yeah. Damien Maia. Perfect game plans and tagged him a few times. He hit him with some decent shit. He's brought but not the right tire and hit him. Hit Tyron, fucked him up, and he drops humped in both fights. And then Dan until he knocked out. Well, he got to dumb. He dropped him and then he choked him. Fucking rocked him. Yeah. Yeah. He dropped drawn. Any a member. Yes. Yeah, that's right. And he didn't know what was coming. It was so weird. It was like it'd be probably had been rattled by all those punches and elbows and shit on the ground too. And he got dropped by a super clean punch. Beautiful counter. Right. Do you know there's a fight for like nine weeks in a row, which I'm not mad at at all. Look at this weird to be TBD.

Speaker 1:          01:04:19       Tbd Tobacco because the heavyweights, the tough heavyweight final, Oh, I've been watching tough heavyweight. It's actually a tough woman's featherweight final. This is the last tough. No, no. They're handling strike you back for a second thing I'd ever think they were thinking it was the last season. Right? Well, when you say really well, Dana said it makes money. J says it does. No one's watching it. I don't know if that's true. How dare because of those, it's hard to tell like when someone just watches something in the moment, right? Like when they have ratings, because almost everybody DVR shit. Now, especially when you talk about cable shows, it is a fact when they're talking about the numbers that they get, that shit is Voodoo. All right? If you get a number, like say if you put up a youtube video and it gets a million hits, that's a million hits. We know for a fact that's a fact. That's a million heads. We don't know how many people it is because some, some people will watch it five or six times. I still believe that when they're doing like Nielsen ratings, Shit that's viewed. Dude, low

Speaker 2:          01:05:17       numbers low. Now they're all sun. Yeah, no, it's no phones. We know that shit is DVR. Now what they do is, cause I know this from my show now what they do is they will do Nielsen, but then they will look at like three days. Do you watch it in three days? Do you watch it the seven days? You know, they have all these different metrics. The metrics still coming from them having to fill out forms or is it something more? It's more technologically based now, but it's still not a, it's not, you know, you're still dealing with a number of those weird definitely doesn't tell you shit. I find that so strange. They don't tell you nothing. I don't want to give you, the power will just flip. How fucked up is that? Because if let's say 30 million people watched your special and like, hey man, we're just gonna run it back.

Speaker 2:          01:06:01       The same thing as last year. You're like, what? Because you can really look and go in and renegotiate and, but they're very generous. Yeah. Maybe they're very generous. I'm telling you. They're very generous. No, I know they paid you well, but I'm, hey everybody. Well, when did they start allowing nudity on Youtube? Is that new or is there a rude real you talking about? You talking about red? No, no, no. I'm talking about you. What the fuck is watching you pour hot naked chicks really about to get a virus. Youtube on Youtube telling you, man, you can watch naked chicks on UTA. It's legal now. Come on. I don't think so. Addie, where did you uh, try us the other day? I'm on Youtube. I'm like hot naked chicks. I want her to see how much can you see? Are you seeing this is just testing it out.

Speaker 2:          01:06:57       I'm like, I wonder if porn is making an onto youtube and I went hot naked chicks and there are videos. I'm doing it right now. Seriously. Isn't that weird that you know, like we'll make a distinction between top lizard bottom on. Slick topless. Yeah. It's kind of racy, but bottom was, oh God, yeah, you're showing pussy. Yeah. What are you doing? Yeah. Is everybody here going to the Tyson purified? I get to work. I'm not. Is that the one in December? Yes. It wasn't that Tyson fury. Fucking wild. Comfort of my own home, sir. It's like this feed up freed up, perhaps cocktail. This is how I'm going to watch apps and then if I have to Poop, I'm going to pause it. Why Shit. And I'm not going to look at my phone so I'm not gonna have any idea. Maybe will happen. Let's do it at Joe's house.

Speaker 2:          01:07:43       Dude, I'm working. I'm in New York. Are you? Are you going? You can come over. I can get you tickets, I'm sure. All right. Hey listen. Brian needs tickets. Tickets. You really want to go there in person. Maybe. I don't know. It seems like a lot of people I'd rather look watch. Not a huge TV. I asked. That's what I'm saying. You know what I like? Do you know what Youtube is doing? That's awesome. Now anytime you punch in like, um, like if you punch in moon hoax, like if you want to watch a conspiracy theory video on the moon hoax, they're going to put a link right on, right under it boomed. It takes you to the Wikipedia of, uh, of the Apollo landings. Like all the, oh, that's cool. Yeah. Just, they're basically debunking the conspiracy theory video right there for ya. I'm watching hot naked chicks on youtube.

Speaker 2:          01:08:29       Let's see if it happens. What do you got? Okay. It's just a photo shoot. Fast forward a little bit. Yeah. Dude, look at that. Did you see that? What's that damn jacking off to you dude? Right. Look at that. Hello. Whoa. She's got to run now, but wait, I saw Ted, you some big ass duties. Hold on. Come on Bro. Look at that. Oh, the houses, they can take their shirts off. Why can't women, I guess they can, dude. You won't see 'em you won't see Genitalia in San Francisco. Well, and then he says, just wait at time. Do you know what the rule is in San Francisco? What? Look at that. You guys didn't know this. No, Bro. Wait a minute. You can see naked vaginas. I kicked your Bush out of my face. San Francisco. You can walk around naked, but you know what the rule is if you're a man, can't touch me. What? What's the what? Yeah. I can't get hard dude with the breeze kid. Hey Bro. Tough Schatz attention or something. You can be naked. Just don't have a hard on to. Why is this, this is crazy. Eddie, how'd you find out about this? I just thought I just punched it into yourself. Just go. Hmm. Let me see what I would just check with you do. I was just checking it cause he's, he's a scientist Bro.

Speaker 2:          01:09:47       Bro. Research row. Now what am I going to research? That is crazy, crazy. No idea. How bout, how bout them? The bunker videos on conspiracy. Like if you put in, put a punch in moon hoax right now. A link at the bottom of it right under the video. But if I titled the Mood, but if I type in moon landing does send me some hoax to no, no it doesn't. It doesn't do that. No, no, no, no, no. That would be good. Alistair Overeem. Oh, you know he changed Kansas elevation elevation in Denver, Colorado. Christian, Alan Cody Donovan. And it looks good. Like the way he looks physically there. He looks good. He does look good. A lot of heavy wrestling there. It's so funny. It's even though he looks great, like you look at him right now, you go, damn, he looks great. The problem with him is you always judge him against what he looked like. So he came when he fought Brock, when he was ubering, when he was the k one Grand Prix champion. When the bus dude, when he was ubering, he was a special thing. Like he was a special thing. No one wanted to fight him. No, can't beat that guy. Yes. Came Pete that Uber Rain.

Speaker 2:          01:10:56       Am I going crazy right? Cain, Cain, Pete, him. [inaudible] he never had might a lot of hard nuts or am I thinking Brock Lesnar, you seeing a Brock Lez guy beat the shit out of him. Cain didn't fight Uber. Him Ever? No, he did it. He beat he beat Brock. Yeah. And thinking of Brian, he smashed Bra. Did he ever fight about a Hari? Yes. Yes. He knocked Badr Hari out with a left Hook and Buhari stopped him in the rematch but high. Yes. But how he stopped him? Yeah. Badr. Hari stopped him in the rematch in the first fight with butter. Hari. I told him, I think the story was that bought her heart was not training very much. Has He retired? Bought her? No.

Speaker 2:          01:11:31       You could fall. Rigo Bro. Hoobin and broke his arm. He's not trying to do, I'm in May though. Right? Did he go to jail? He fought one MMA fight, I believe. Butter. Hardier management. Why do you get it? You got to jail a couple times. Fuck you. Fuck the shit out of people putting them hands on motherfucker. Badr Hari. So scary. I mean, dude. He's like, Nah, fuck with that guy. He's a knockout. Hemper yeah, but, but it pays off in fighting and he's, he's got some amazing fights on his highlight reel, dude. How about, how about your first fight in the UFC? This Russian dude, I'll see the champion, this Russian organization and they're like, hey, you got to call the UFC cool. Who am I fighting? Alistair Overeem, like, can I ask you a question? I get those warm up. How many times has he been knocked out?

Speaker 2:          01:12:13       153 are shitting really bad every time. I see it isn't, it isn't cause he wins and you know, it's the, it's the, you know, it's, he's at heavyweight. That guy used to fight. Well, we just accept the fact Polish guy. Right? Is that Christoph says Zinsky no, it's John Shara. Okay. Sorry. Oh, he looks like it's Jeff Munson. Ciesynski had a, he had fucking tattoos everywhere. Still does. It's white as shit. He's a white guy. He's Russian Bro. Man. He's white. White. That blends with snow. So like when you're looking at over him, even though he does look great, you compare his looking great to what he looked like when he was Uber. Did he looks fucking good though. Oh yeah. A version of Uber Him. Yeah. But if he like, well he used to be a fucking nine 11 gts, three Rs and now he's just a regular nine 11 there's a good way of putting it now.

Speaker 2:          01:12:59       He's like a career Targa how old is he now? He's getting up there. He's 38 yeah, he's getting up there guys. And he's been fighting forever. Most skilled heavyweight. Striking. Oh Sue, still fuck. He's highly skilled. Highly skilled. K One champ. That's what I'm a cowboys. Toronto. He said that he's like sparring with him. Is it such a joy because he's so technical. So good. Oh Shit. Watch out for that. I mean he's, he's won more than share. He's lost a bunch too, but he's one of the best trackers to ever fight. Never man. I'm going with Papa Lovett. You on this fight. I'm taking my over him. He's going to hurt. Yeah, he's gonna. I, I'm impressed with the strength. You think he's hurt? No. I mean he got hit but when he's hurt you know it, it doesn't take much with the government cause he's been hit so many, put out so many times he thought, oh he's full.

Speaker 2:          01:13:52       Still pretty good though. You got clipped there. He just, he just doesn't take shots as well as he did when he was ubering to, because of the size of his neck, his neck and his traps. He used to have like these built in shock absorbers all run his head. Yeah. Isn't, isn't glass Justin Drum reel though, where your body shuts down. It's your brain from so much trauma. So as soon as nasty trauma that Nope, we're not doing this anymore. It's really not. I asked, he needed a bone. It's your brain at your child's just got some fucking knees man. Yeah. So definitely the best need. Shadow Dude, skull shore. That guy that got knocked out. He had, I dunno, I dunno how he got knocked out, but it was on the news that uh, um, he had a severe concussion maybe, you know, maybe it was in a coma and he wakes up and he's super smart.

Speaker 2:          01:14:44       He knows all this. Like he's a genius man. My name Brendan, just Brian counts to struck by lightening the Oliver Sacks. This guy got us a thing, not a John Travolta movie. The Guy, the guy who got struck by lightning, who became obsessed with piano and became a concert pianist, but down, it's a true story, sac study. But there's also someone who got fucked, either lightning or a w had a horrible concussion. Woke up just fluent in Chinese so she, okay. So it happens. Shit happens when it's one of those things where you hear about it and you go, wait a minute, wait a minute. Never met him though. I mean read this story. Those stories are bullshit. I think there's some people that definitely gets struck by lightning and then all of sudden they're good at math. What if it's true? What if we, what if we find out?

Speaker 2:          01:15:32       It turns out that the more you get knocked out, the smarter you get. That's what happened to me. How, how cool training, how cool would kickboxing training people lose? Just gave it be stupid. But then you'd get to knock people over on a daily basis, ground and pound and thinking that he's been working with Curtis Blade, so I'm assuming he's been working on this a shitload. What I think is really cool is when a mathematician works on a crazy math problem his whole life, it has no bears, no relevance to the physical world in a hundred years later, years later they're using it to put a rover on Mars or something like it has relevance a hundred years later over Raymont top nasty ground. And pound man just hit me. I'm a little high. Do you remember when, uh, do you remember when? Of course we don't. Did you see that fucking missionary? The Christian missionary went to that island in India.

Speaker 2:          01:16:26       It's still a saint and island and he's like, no, I'm going to give the word of Jesus. And Jesus loves you too. And he and they're like Ha. And then killed him instant. I think he got shot through the glass. I think Ireland. Is that what you said? Something like Sentinel Island, north central island. They, they left Africa 60,000 years ago and they would live it on this island. And what's interesting is to say, Guy, I tweeted it on my page, there's a guy over and finish him off cause fights or shout out till it's over. Powerful. I always root for over him now to me the holds on that mother fucker still doing it, man. 38 doing it, doing it right there too. One more win. And he's a title shot. He's always that guy. Dot over it. Well he's definitely in the hunt for it. I mean, look, when he fought steep a member

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       when he hurts deep bay. Yeah. It's just as possible that he could have stopped [inaudible] number and they're like, Joe, let's bring that up, you know? Well, maybe not there. Well that was when I decided not to interview people that have been killed or just like, it's not fair. They don't, they have a false memory like to get just got knocked out by steep Amy. Oh chick dude. I wouldn't mind seeing him first. France, Francis again. You crazy son. I don't want to see that again. I don't want to see anybody get hit like that again. If I go through the rest of my days, what are we talking about? Satan guy or the island. Oh, sentinel. So here's what's crazy. They used to be, they used to be sort of uncontacted but they got contacted in the 18 hundreds by this guy. Now this is a guy a on Twitter posted this amazing review with all this stuff is, is his name is respectable law on, um, on, on Twitter.

Speaker 1:          01:18:05       So he posted this really long detailed history of what happened to these people. And a guy name Maurice Vital, V v Dow Portman. And this guy, uh, apparently stayed on the island for a long time and people got sick because of these people being there. They don't have any diaries. They have no will, they have no immunity to, but he measured their Dick Sizes and you measured, their boss has his, he made them pose and all these weird ways like it's really freaky shit, but really, really interesting. You're like, okay, he's measuring the children and stuff like treated them like in Weirdo him offs and stuff, but talked about them like in really weird sexual terms. And this guy was such a bad experience for those people that uh, they're the devil and it was a bike a hundred years ago. So when people go back now, they immediately kill him.

Speaker 1:          01:18:58       So because of this one Dick Wad that landed there a hundred years ago, they think of white people as evil. So these two fishermen fell asleep and I want to say it was like 2006 they fell asleep and their boat drifted onto the island. They woke up, they just fucking Hatcher dumb. And to them and killed him on the beach. They live, they don't fuck around anymore. Think about this one asshole. If you think about it, it's really smart in a fuck that way because if they get in, come into contact one of us, the entire, their entire population could be wiped out because they don't have immunity. They're saintliness, right? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Right. You sure? No, no, no, no, no, no. David confirmed them. I heard this from good morning. I'm no, no, no, no, not good morning America set the North Sentinel island dude.

Speaker 1:          01:19:41       I'm pretty sure the last full saintliness island. Here's the deal, Brendan St on even Satan, Satan is a western concept. He just, they have no idea. They just hate white people. Oh well is there what they don't like foreign people who's gene? I Dunno by an actor it has name of, they just didn't say white people cause that one dude came to fuck everything up and then you see a white person kill him data. We don't even know their language. So to say they're satanists is crazy. It's like saying that you understand what they're saying. That's the room. How big is, how big is that island? A translator was in Manhattan. Really? Now they don't have a translator. Eddie, they don't even any contact at all. The outside world. It's illegal. Oh, that guy got killed and he paid illegally to go with it. What are they?

Speaker 1:          01:20:26       To leave her and go to? The fishermen got arrested. So there was a cargo ship that ran a ground there many years ago here. There was in 1981. Uh, and uh, the crew radioed for assistance and then they got 50 men with bows and arrows were showing up to, to try to get to the boat and they helicoptered them away. The boat is still there. So this is a crazy ass placement. Sounds like an awesome movie. So I know. And then from that, from that boat, they started getting metal tools because they didn't have metal before that. So until the 19, was it 1980 81? Yeah. So now these, these people took pieces of metal and, and cold forged them into weapons and shit, like pounded them down with rocks and, and created knives and stuff. But these people, they're essentially living the same way people lived 60,000 years ago.

Speaker 1:          01:21:19       They've been on this isolated island ever since then. It's of maybe we should just fly over and drop a ton of iPhones everywhere. There's the problem. They don't know how many of them, there aren't any more, but they know their populations are declining. So at once, at one point in time there was a 150 plus documented and now they think it might be as low as 39 cause disease and stuff. They don't have any, just fucking probably board of Methodist. Stop fucking, you know, trying to get fish. You don't have time to raise the kid. Which one are you talking about? This? Emily's, yeah, there their population that he left drastically dropping. There's no a generic, there's no genetic diversity there. It's like, I'm sure, yeah, 3,900 folks, 39 folks is a small number. If they're really down to that few. And, uh, you know, they're real, real aggressive when anybody comes anywhere near them.

Speaker 1:          01:22:07       But the thing is, now that we all know about it be, I'm a part of the problem too, right? We were all talking about this. Now that we all know about it, more people are going to think about going there. Thank you. A hundred bucks a year of that. And I say, fuck leaving the United States, hundred percent where is that place? It's somewhere off of India. They have bingo. They have been gone. So it doesn't seem that remote. If it's an Ebay, it's pretty far. It's far away. It's hard to it literally. It's illegal. It's like in the middle of the ocean wrinkle. So homeboy, he was doing God's work. It was like, no, I can do it. And even Ryan, his journals like, man, I hope I don't die if I do. My parents don't be mad at me. I'm headed this island. Yeah. What the fuck were you thinking, man? Well, he's crazy. He's trying to convert people. He thinks people need Jesus the same language. They don't have any idea what he's saying. He's from oral Roberts heart graduated from Oral Roberts University, right? Yeah. See there. That's where it is. C as well. Shit. Way Out there and a half stars out of fun. So let's go in there. If I go with it, 3000

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       and that's given it all this reviews, you get defeated. Go ahead. Then you'll go ahead and then there's a suite four seasons. They have great food. It's called human that's going to eat you bitch. Oh, so they, they killed the guy and then they buried him right on the beach. Man. They just dragged his body out to the beach and the Sherman Indian government said, we're not going to do anything about it. And it was a shit there. That's all they know. Well, yeah. I mean, first of all, they, their law is you can't visit their island. That's their law. So he was violating their law, him showing up with a this book. I would imagine they'd, they have laws against people visiting, especially whites. Yeah, man. That, that story that they tell about that one English guy that went there, that was a piece of shit fucked up for everybody. I hope that guy respectable law on Twitter, uh, understands how much I appreciate that. So that was cool. Yeah. So they're all songs. The just I need to read more navy seals. Oh yeah. Take them all out.

Speaker 2:          01:24:15       Automatic. It would be a cool video. You never know. They might have some crazy booby traps. They might have some Vietcong Shit for beautiful vacation toe, but it's Starbucks. Look at the person with the locals. When here was my girlfriend for a holiday, I loved it. She wasn't impressed. Very poor choice for a romantic getaway. Great choice for anyone looking to rough it up a bit. So silly. People are so funny. Well, that island though is um, there's gotta be people going, fuck no. Under the coming century. Dan Bilzerian is going to be there next month with a bikini on the house. It's going to just send a boatload of vape pens. It was that I was taking a piss. India, India, India. They came from Africa though 60,000 years ago. It's like draws closer to Thailand. Pretty amazing. Just kind of, they know that how, how, how would they figure that out if you're not allowed to go on the island that they'd been around 60,000 years ago? It's a good question. I don't know. Well, it's, I can pop on a Guinea. Those tribes have been isolated for, for 40,000 years. Yeah, still. Yeah. Not Anymore. But I mean, when Jared diamond went and studied them, they'd been isolated for that long. They practice weird things too, like widow strangling and all kinds of screening widow, stranger and that one tribe where you were, the young boys suck the Cox of the older men and take it in their ass as well to become men. So they in the sperm, it's not just some weird started that.

Speaker 2:          01:25:59       If you don't have somebody that can, can compete with those ideas, then that gets passed down as religion. I've got to Piss. So tell me who wins what. I Never Seen Him take a pee break. No. Yeah, the first, first time. Love. There you go. That's right. We can pause. Go on with your little lilac. Sure. Frances and got on boys. I'm excited about this fight, which Jack does always. Yeah, it's a big fight for a minute. Cause remember he beat him last time, but he's coming off that steep a ass whooping and then had the horrible fight against Derek Lewis, which is like the worst heavyweight fight of all time. No one won that fight. Obviously Derek won that fight because the judges and then Derek goes on to fight for it. Since then, this is his first fight since Derek Lewis. Oh Shit. I don't like it because obviously he struggles with wrassling so like go, here's Curtis plays the best wrestler in the top five. I just don't like it. I would show the game someone else who matched up better, no matter if he wins or loses. I just don't think it was a great idea. Um, is he from Chad? Where's he from? Ghana. Chad the Congo. Congo. You shoot man. I thought he was from more west. I think it's the Congo. Jamie. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:27:16       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:27:17       Curtis placements in Ghana. That's a French name. So it makes sense. He's from the Congo. I'm pretty sure it was tango policies sees Ghana, Cameroon. Is that where he's from? Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:27:28       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:27:29       Well Cameron's one of the last places where there's like sort of continuous habitat for different animals. Oh, he's coming out to mortal Kombat but up woo, great tune. Now they're fighting at three 30 in the morning our time. So it's a bit of a time Chad Shit time. Curtis blades just always fights on foreign land. When did they get there? How many days do you need to adjust that? They had thanksgiving over there, so I'm assuming they get, well I imagine he gets, he flies in on Tuesday like any other fight week. Right. Do what? I would want to come early. It's hard to get used to sleeping over there. I can't imagine. Yeah, it, I was in Thailand in here. Can't you just try to take naps and you can but the sunset and all that fucks you up. The best way I say it, they say it's just fast for like 16 hours and then eat. I like when you get there in the morning, eat, have breakfast and just get on the same, your body gets used to the eating cycle. Fastings were they important? Apparently for. Okay. That's what you did over there. I be, I tried. I tried to work now and you're still tired but you still thinking of moving to China? I am going to go to Beijing and living in an apartment. Are you going to be a political dissident?

Speaker 2:          01:28:42       I'm mean, I'm marching and [inaudible] Australia as a time change fucked me up. I was exhausted and he came back up. I go in there, I was fine coming back. I was so fucked up in that weird that it's going back somehow or another dose two or uh, you know what I need to try taking Melatonin like one I land like when I, when I need to go to bed that night. Yeah, I don't think so. I try to help, you know what helps me? CBD Oil. Yeah. It helps me relax. I take it in the morning, but especially at night, at night, it helps me without, without the thing that seems to be about reset my system better than anything is a serious fucking workout look like, show up somewhere and do a serious workout, like to push a cardio, lift some weights, like really get tired and that seems to set me, set me up, did that and I've kind of stopped because I was so funny.

Speaker 2:          01:29:33       I said that I started when I was in Afghanistan while we worked out, me and Deb David, I've worked out like a motherfucker and I did. It helped me a lot. I felt way better. It puts your cycle, Babs, you're afraid the whole time. Usually on the road, wherever I land I worked out. Yeah. When I land I'll work out and I feel better. That's the moon. But there's a new scientific study range. Crisper, like everything's better. Yeah. This, this scientific study. I'll find it at the end of my phone. Yeah, please get where we're at. We're fasting for 16 hours is the most important thing you can do and then reset time changed. I usually sending your clock with however they were eating there because [inaudible] 91 yeah, I've heard that you should not eat on planes too. I've heard that you're better off just not eating on planes on the ground plane.

Speaker 2:          01:30:15       When you get, when you land like your, your body will be better off falling into this new time zone when you land. If you just don't need on that you don't even know I'm playing to ever. I meditate on his position, dude. When they come by with that card and they get that snack tray. Yeah. Nice cheeses, fruits and shit. Pringles. Sometimes I just want a banana. I me too. Sometimes I just want to Swedish fish. Ah, I talked to Pat. His fish. Yeah. And Pringles smoke macro. The sweetest fish and the little crack. No, no sweets Fisher though. That candies you don't, you do sometimes if I, if I'm feeling Frisky, damn. I feel like I've earned it if I'm coming back from a long fricking couple of nights. So the thing, I never feel like I earned those every time he thought it was. I feel like a bad boy and I don't feel great.

Speaker 2:          01:31:01       After I flew first class to London and they got food and I was eating cheeses and wines to get hammered. No, but I just kept drinking and eating and I just felt like, fuck you shit on the plane. Um, no, I don't think so. You felt terrible when you landed. I was just one big sodium Bob. Yes. I'll have more chase. Do you have a wheel back there? Sure. And I'll leave. I know another ice cream Sundae. I just went a little crazy and wine. Yeah, that's what that fucks me. I find the do good writing on planes though. You get some good ideas out because it's just you alone staring at this, you're not moving right. You're, you're confined to this little seat. You're not going anywhere. Sometimes good ideas come when you just sit like that. It's so easy to just fuck off.

Speaker 2:          01:31:48       When you're at home. I know you're writing, you just, it's so easy to just get, let me see what's in the fridge and me go grab a cup of coffee. I set a timer, 23 minutes. I don't know why but 23 minutes and then I can't move. Kayla's good man. I think I just, you know, I just forced myself to do it. The thing is, what's weird about it is for whatever reason I resist doing it at first like, ah, but then once I get into it and I catch a groove, I love it. Yeah. It's like getting into a cold bath. Like at first your skin's like mark and then you're like, Oh yeah, I uh, I think everything is that way. I think inspiring yourself to kind of get started and then kind of figure out a way to keep it even working out though.

Speaker 2:          01:32:28       I did did my class this morning in that box, morning cardio class and when we start I'm like, God, it, why did I come? And then halfway through I'm like, this is great. Yeah. Well you know what man, I fucked myself up. But that a sober October fitness challenge thing, that's a bad idea and this is what fucks you up. Like afterwards, you look regular working out. It seems boring because everything was this cycle hours, five hours a day. We're competing against each other. You'd get anxiety like check the APP, see where everybody's scores. That shit. Fuck. You know you need, you can do that. You still beating against Bert Kreischer, Arusha, fear and Tom Segura. So let's take it easy. No, I'm not saying I'm still, you still. You know what I mean? Like my competition, those guys, he's going to coast. The last guy. Competitiveness. I'm telling you, man brushed him.

Speaker 2:          01:33:23       Joe. Joe was like Glass Cham Haynes in that motherfuckers would have no chance. Kim Haines and me and that bitch. We should do a real fitness dude. I'm telling you, even if you're doing it, the thing is, it's about how much time you spend. It's about how hard you worked down. See, it's like how much time are you spending at 80% of your Max heart rate? That's really what it's been. That's watch how fast and Gannaway is Jesus. Oh, he's terrifying. We should probably wash. He's laying on his feet too, right? Yeah. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God, he just so powerful. Oh my God. Ooh. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, that's it. That's it. That's it. Dan. He's back. Oh my God. Starched him. Wow. You can't, that was crazy. Tad of an early stoppage, but I don't know. It looked like it was almost an early stopped working his way back up.

Speaker 2:          01:34:18       No, I don't think it was around. I stop thinking. I was going to say it looked like it was almost early stoppage and then they let it go on and then it was a decent stop. Yeah, I agree. Because that's how you save a fighter. It seem like that's, how are you getting that? They were going to stop it. Yeah. He got, he got concussed right away. He got percent three chances Curtis place 26 years old. Give him, he's got a lot of fight left in them, so just that's a good stop. It's fine. He's just got caught. Literally just got cut. Good stops. The only, I think it was the only way he's gonna lose this fight. It's getting cut. Yup. God. That's what happened. Got to look fast. Listen. That's the levels of standup between them. You know what I mean? Curtis blades is a good stand up fighter, but a really good wrestler.

Speaker 2:          01:34:57       His wrestling stats, so like the, some of the best in the heavyweight division. He, Beth, as far as a successful taping on the back of the head with that hammer. God, boom. See like right there. It looked like the ref was about to stop it. Boom. Wow. So much power runs over there and look, he touches them. He touched him. You're not supposed to touch him. He prayed to his friend and knew my name. Yeah. I don't know man. I thought he was going to stop, boom. And that then he decided to it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's a dangerous job, man. Supersede that. A clip from the Moitai, one of the, uh, Moy Tai websites has it up there of this referee is stepping in to stop this fight and then it's a head case. I saw it. He gets it. Takes a shin right to the dome, gets knocked the fuck out while he stayed conscious, but he went down.

Speaker 2:          01:35:48       Let me see. It's moving, but he get head kicked. That's a dangerous man. And the first thing you imagine me and Curtis page right now, you took the plane for 20 hours to fly over to get knocked down. 45 seconds. They'll worst. Yeah. The longest possibility within Ghana. God damn good frigging in Ghana and get back on track. I wasn't crazy about the fight for him. Yeah. What did he say about that fight? Officially? Which one? Where he didn't throw any punches. He said the carried the fear of his last fight is confidence. And then Dennis was hurt. So you get a shit show, you know, it's neither one of those fault Dick was hurt with his back. Francis had no confidence. It was crazy. I mean it was the squeakiest of squeaky margins for Derek to win because nothing really happened in the fight they had.

Speaker 2:          01:36:38       No one really won. It was just while we were talking about that fight. We were like, Ho Lee Shit. This is going to be bombs away. That's why I think yes, people say it's the worst heavyweight fight cause you just thought it was going be fucking fireworks. I think I might've even said in the commentary, there's not a doubt in my mind that this is going to be crazy. But who wouldn't think that? That's fair to think with their two fighting styles. I didn't know thought it was going to be chaos. I thought awesome. Derek is going to be throwing haymakers trying to find his chin. I'd like to see him go at it again. That I would love to see that as Floyd really fighting that one kickbox yes. Yeah. You Know David agreed to. It's real but it's going to be a, an exhibition boxing match.

Speaker 2:          01:37:17       Fake kind. It's a boxing match. They're probably going to wear big gloves. No kicks, no checks. No. Unless it's too smart for that. Unless the fucking, the Japanese just say Oh okay. So we agree. Kick it too. Unless, unless, unless the accuser goes up to that kid and go, hey here fucking head kick him Kale. We're going to give you a $2 million in the middle of the first round. Kind of cool to see. But they'll rush you through some contract negotiations. Okay. He would go. It was weird cause Floyd was like, that was all bullshit and we agreed to any of this. Then a week later he's like, actually we're going to do it. Listen the Japanese or they

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       do a different kind of business. They're very clever over there. You know the UFC got kind of the got kind of like when you look at the, the sale of pride, you know, like what happened with all that? They, they did a smart thing, a really smart thing. One thing that came over and they pretended they were going to have pride fighters fight in the UFC and UFC fighters. Frightened pride. Remember that in the early days, like the EOC that shuffle the child, the Dell over there and they were going to bring fighters over to America. He never did. Yeah. No, they never did. I had to wait until they bought it. And then when they bought it, they basically just bought a DVD library. Yep. And they spend like $60 million for pride. And when they got it, they couldn't even run it. So then they had these people that were running the office and these people were in the office.

Speaker 1:          01:38:38       They just went off and made dream. They made their own shit. And so they were like sold basically a logo and a brand and these contracts, the contracts weren't even any good. Like they didn't like a lot of the fighters were not bound to them, you know, like fate or like they didn't have fade or they did this, they didn't have a lot of things and they owed a lot of guys money and they thought they were going to operate in Japan. Like what? We're going to run pride too is what like right, that shit. No chance male way. But what they did with those smart is the, the first thing pride did was they pumped up their own value by bringing their fighters over here and pretending they're fighters going to fight you. Chocolate. Dell, remember they had that crazy stare down way back in the day, but, but then they never did.

Speaker 1:          01:39:18       We, everybody's always talking about nothing happened. But after that, what they did not want pride mentioned on the air. No, they hate him. Dre want them their name men. How is Bella towards to say they fought in Japan. The USC also honey dicked the WME, when they sold their thing, like, look dude, we got Rhonda, we got Brock, we got Connor, we're doing all this big shit man. And then they sold it for $4 billion and like I run is going to retire, so we can't do nothing about that Bronx over in WWII. So we'll figure that out. Well the Rhonda and then college for two years of purchase, they, that was, they had already purchased it. That was the last Ronda fight. The Comeback Fire they had already purchased. That's also probably why it was marketed the way it was marketed. Correct. Because all eggs in a, that was one of the rare times where I publicly was like, this is not, here's aren't doing the right thing because the Amanda Nunez, the champion, she's a world champion.

Speaker 1:          01:40:15       She stopped me. Should teach you, strangled her. Like you gotta give her respect. She still not as respect as she should be, but that was, that was a crazy one. That was the worst one I've ever shows. All Rhonda, nothing of a manager and a couple seconds just like Amanda doing something real quick and that's it. Like there should like hitting the bag, but the rest was first ever women's MMA champion that that's a lesbian first ever. UFC with her girlfriend. The corner. Yeah. Who's also a courtesy champion. So first ever gay UFC champion. Right. And no one talks we know of that we know of. Right. I think that's it. I think it was point we haven't that women's and made that long for champions. Well, you're saying you're saying guy or Gal? Girl. I'm

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       just trying to be funny. I started thinking about what gave champion. I was like, who could be gay? But Amanda Versus Cyborgists Hoop or interesting. Super interesting to me because uh, you know, sideboards, she's way bigger. She's bigger. How about Amanda or Cal Pennington and both their girlfriends fight in the UFC two and then in their corners. Crazy. That's insane. Insane in a bad way, but cool. Yeah. I mean we've come a long ways. Yeah. It's different. It's fascinating to watch her bag. Yeah. JDS fighting. Um, they both been out a fucking grip. Keynes coming back here. That, is that real? Yeah, Dude. I'm 19 but when did they have a date? No, just announce he's back in DC. Posted. Hey, he said the belts waiting for the champ. Whoa, he's back. So what do you guys think of Amanda Against Cyborg? I think Amanda's got to move. I think a only she have a chance.

Speaker 2:          01:41:54       Sure. She's got a chance. She's a beast, but, oh shit. That's a great fight. Tied to a Vasa Janie. That's right. The mother fucking fight. You right. Favorite could probably be Cyborg. I don't, there's no, there's no, there's no girls. But she's like Joana, man, it's not happening. She's got a chance. Amanda Nunez is probably my favorite female fighter too. I really wouldn't. She walked around that. What do you think, Amanda? She's probably in the one sixties if I had to guess. And what do you think cyborg walks around that we went through this right? She said she's down there. You know, she got mad. She was bigger. She, she's such an animal. She is so much bigger. That's going to be a crazy fight, man. That's on the same card as a Gus van Jones too too. Yeah. Yeah. Gus, it's been a hot minute. She can't wait for that fight. Yeah, I know. Right. I think the key to, to anybody that's going to be able to beat Cyborg is you're going to have to catch her coming in and having her cock.

Speaker 2:          01:42:56       No girl, no girls beating the sidebar. No girls being cyborg. There's not a girl on this planet that can beat side, but what about that one dude? The turned into a check. She would get fucking dealt with. What? Or she lost her last fight? Fallon. Fox. Ashley. Evan Smith. Who's in the UFC beat her dad. Yeah. Nice sideboard. Beat both of them up at the same time. Now. I mean she does. She's such an animal man. You seen her spar with like dude and then that Olympian, she was a shield. Who's a world champion. Yeah, like dude, she does not fuck up. She doesn't fuck around and she's waiting. This is our last fight on a contract to, well, you know what man? I mean I could easily see someone like one fc grabbing her as well. Look, they're grabbing a lot of people now. It's really interesting to me grabbing though they have to sign.

Speaker 2:          01:43:45       You should tape but that's business. Well we got Eddie Alvarez. He just went over there. Three guy, Demetrius mighty mouse Johnson. We just went over there and uh, they're looking to expand the roster and I think they're looking to also break into the western market place. You know they have that APP. You can get the APP and watch the fights on your phone. Yeah, I've only seen highlights. I've only seen highlight to one FC. I've never seen him watch it for free. How, how's Belterra today in comparison? Yes. Bella towards not doing as well as the UFC, but they're doing well. They're doing well on the paramount network. They get pretty good ratings to, but they also with Rory Mcdonald Gig Army Saucy, then with the heavyweight with bait or fade or like the heavyweight tournament was sick. Yeah, they're doing well. The think about Oscar de la Hoya promoting them and like complete shit.

Speaker 2:          01:44:29       Show this one. Not this one. Do you see the last one I did. Did you see him at a press conference? I want to see chuck and Tito. No, no, no, not, it's not a shit show cause it's chuck and Tito. Do you see Oscar de la Hoya? He's like, you got, you got chocolate [inaudible] name wrong. Then he goes and then you have these other guys. How did he go? Check window? Uh, I forget it. I lie down. Lie Down. Everyone used to say chuck lie down. I used to say at first, that's what you say in a shyness. He didn't know any of the fighters and he was the first one. You give them a little bit of that, but what else did he say? He goes and then we'll, you know, we have other fights too. These guys behind me, I don't know their names, but you know, I'm not gonna remember their shit.

Speaker 2:          01:45:10       No Way. Yeah, there's just dead silence. He's like, you know, and when you think of him in May, when you think of fighters at all, you know, you just think of these two. There's no one else that is the dumbest way to promote a fight. It was so nice. Oscar's had, you know how many professional fights? A lot, and he snorts all the cocaine. Does he do all of it? Watch this press conference. He's all, and uh, he was like, whoa. Where it's freezing it does that mean, is that a fact? No, he's admitted. He came on there was the dad abuse prom and pretty, it's like devil's Dandruff. I don't think his love and his Dandruff, I don't think his love his MMA is love his boxing. It's just, you know, he's doing this one, you know, I hope it does well because Tito and chuck will get benefit the most from it for the money. So I want people to buy it because that reason hammer stone the game. No, no. He was my manager. What? Holy Shit. Oh yeah, they had long talks. Great Dude's smart dude. What happened? Why did he get out of MMA? Because it's bullshit, you know? He was like, why did I like money? Fuck this sport.

Speaker 2:          01:46:15       How else is he making money? A dude, he's one of the first investors in Facebook, Twitter, Twitter. So He's filthy rich. Yeah. Oh Shit. Okay. He goes, and I remember he said, he goes, well, there's a difference between you and bankrupt and be an MC hammer. Bankrupt. He was, I wasn't like poor. So you got still balling? Yeah. Yeah. He started like 12. Nine was, he's smart dude, man. I'm sure. Interesting. Um, what were we just talking about before the four MC Hammer. Amanda Nunez and Chris Herman. No, no, that was way long. Devil island. If you're white, you can't go to the island anymore. That

Speaker 1:          01:46:50       will completely lost Yammer. Uh, we were talking about promoting, oh, what fc. Oh, what I've seen, look, I hope they all do good. We just, you definitely need like more competition, more fun. There's more fighters in there are fights. Right. And uh, the hard thing though is that the UFC is like cue tips, right? It's like when you think you don't want cotton swabs, give me some fucking cute tips. They they've got the market. You're, there's tissue Kleenex. Yeah, for now. For now, but there's always, I don't know if there's such a, it's such a part of the cultural landscape. Like some people go, oh do you do you UFC? Yeah. How fucking dare you hoped that they would get to the point. I would hope, this is my goal. My hope is that a lot of organizations are like a lot of these boxing organizations will you look at like world champions like Deontay wilder was about to fight Tyson fury.

Speaker 1:          01:47:45       You could have guys that have different promoters and they worked together some sort of a deal and then they put together the fights. That's better for the fighters if the fights get in the fighters who both organizations get it's popular, right. As you know, it's like Manny Pacquiao, fighting Floyd Mayweather. They had to have these promoters figure out how to put that fight together. Sport better for everyone because we've been asking is whooping ass over one fc what you love if he just fought the champion that you have short Bella tours champion like gay army saucy fight Woodley. Right now we're fighting fighting Whitaker. I'd love to see that. They're going to be very happy that they signed Ben Aspirin. It's going to be fun. He's smart. He talks a lot of shit and it took forever to get him over here and a lot of people are in deep shit.

Speaker 1:          01:48:26       They're in deep shit. He's going to grab a hold of them and wrestle. Fuck them to the ground and punch their face. Isn't that going to be much they going to be able to do to a lot of people are going to be real sharp man. Like you look at the well he goes anywhere the chin from that. The interviews are scrum for him. Yeah. Look man, people who've seen the interviews online, uh, they seem the podcast that I did with them, they've seen all of his fights. You know, if you watch highlight reels, you could see all of his fine. When I Jack Him off every show we get every show and then the u s are in one FC. They allowed him to needed the head on the ground too. He gets site control now the fuck out of your head. I'll see.

Speaker 1:          01:49:00       Can't damn man. It's a nightmare. You can also get north, south, north, south knees to the head. Oh my God. Oh my God. Fuck somebody up is fs one? Yeah. Oh fuck. Don't say fs. One, one FC. Oh, when I say, I mean I know what you meant. Fox sports one hasn't Channel One FC. I meant but to be able to do that, to be able to land knees to the head on the ground like that, those giant advantage for a restaurant, giant advantage and to take it away from them that you like limit like what is really good about being on top. It's really good about being on top is you could smash them anywhere. It's kind of weird. Those knees. Did you hear the rumor about Cowboy Connor? I did. Yeah. It could be sick. Fuck yeah. I think hope. Can we get that fight?

Speaker 1:          01:49:41       I think that's a possibility. I think that that's a moneymaking fight and then you may sense for both the guys, Connor Connor wants to Coby rematch, but it's like, dude, let's get one and then go back that way. But you got to win. That would be really, I'm not saying cowboys and easy fight, but it's a better match up then could be were Tony and then Tony could be fight. It's going to be interesting to see what kind of shit talking. Cause Cowboy did not have a good time with the shit. Talking of Nate Diaz, he got in his hat or mosfet out. He doesn't like that shit. Talk doesn't like that Shit. Conor goes, you guys did that watch. Then he's going to wrap it up to 11 until I think cowboy, if he grabs a of the Connor and takes him to the ground. Condoms in a world of shit too.

Speaker 1:          01:50:25       Cause cowboys a hell of a wrestler and a Halloween. He's a hell of a striker. To me it's a different, it's a different words. Not An easy fight. It's gonna be called on the, as far as the, the odds, I'm, I'm assuming Conard barely be a favorite if 91 55 one 55 Connors, the the speed that he has, the one shot Kao power. Like Connor can do some shit to motherfuckers and when you see him fight Eddie Alvarez, that's when you really realize it. Like Eddie Alvarez is tough as fuck and Connor just put it on him. He can start, he can fuck people up about cowboy put it on navy too. He did. But he didn't do it the same way. He didn't meet his legs. He beat his legs up. He didn't, he didn't see a man shot. Connor Dis, Eddie. Eddie might've been shots.

Speaker 1:          01:51:11       I think that also is a little misleading cause I feel like a lot of that is because Conor got into Eddie's head but, and he's better than that. Look at that shit and he's been doing it long. Conor McGregor is a two to one favorite. That doesn't make any sense to me. Well, it does make sense and not as good a wrestler, which makes sense because you're going based off of how cowboy won his last fight. Fallen some tough times. I left out way more than anyone in this room. But he's got the most winning record in UFC history too, I believe. So I'm also going by that. And he did. He also has one more fun lately. Well he looked fantastic against Mike Perry, the amazing, but Mike [inaudible] far cry from congressman. Big Difference. But look, I like the fire fighter. I like to fight a lot. And I do agree that if cowboy gets a hold of anybody on the ground, he's got crazy ground skills. Calcium, crazy capital naked holding up a cowboy. He's better off his bat. Cause if Connor would it take him down, he would be screwed. But cowboy and tops not a technician on top. No, I disagree. You think he's technician on top, top caliber from his back cupboard from his back. He's good everywhere.

Speaker 1:          01:52:20       Yes. Yes. But he'll fuck you up from the top. He's got, he's got great. Most of the submissions are from his back. That's true because he throws a lot of kicks and guys take them down and just snapchat super special off his back. He, but he's just, he's very underrated as a grappler. Yeah. And you saw many reversed Mike Perry. Fucking amazing. Fucked his arm up. How about my parents? He's not, he's, he left Jackson's, he's like, dude, I felt like it was, you know, I didn't want to be part of came there to train and all of a sudden I got put in the middle of this drama. He left. He left. Oh, was no longer there. Oh Wow. You look great too. I thought he looked good. He, you know, obviously you had the hiccup of taking cowboy down, but I thought Perry, like pretty fucking good man.

Speaker 1:          01:52:59       Yeah, no, Perry did look very good. He's been looking better and better, but he just fucked up and took him down. That fight was just, cowboy had his number. Cowboy sparred with him. Who knows how many times they also Jackson's. Yeah. And the, and the grappling, apparently cowboy dominated him, but I guess Perry said in when in their training camp he was taking so many guys down is almost like a natural reaction from he goes, dude, I just, part of the fight just took him down. David thinking back, cause that's what I was doing in camp. Right. And then Winkeljohn goes, that was not part of the plan. We did not want to take cab way down. So where's he gonna go now? I don't know. I think he was att before, right? Yeah. I don't know. But for him it men, he's getting so much better if he just stays consistent, gets with a legit cam, maybe get his ass up to Tristar were Aka, I liked something about going to Montreal.

Speaker 1:          01:53:46       Sexy Malkai it's so cold, so cold. The coldest I've ever been. Plus in another country, you know, you just, it's so far you've got to also just really super concentrate on what you're doing because it's all you're doing. Yeah. Well I liked beautiful city though. That's like a strip club and food. I can live match allegedly. It's amazing. I think that could happen. Like you gotta you gotta beat, I think got to be with some one of the wizards. There's many great wizards of MMA. But to really maximize your potential, you gotta be with someone who can put it all together. You know, and you could pick your favorite wizards, but one of my favorite ones, it's for sure it's for us. I think he's like one of the best of not him. Who has the best, one of the best for sure. The best. Rufus Matt Hume does not have very many high level guys that have been, I mean he did work with Maurice though.

Speaker 1:          01:54:41       All right. Yes, he's in Ca AMC pankration. But he, um, was a great fighter himself. Just great knowledge of the game. But what he, just by proof of what he did with mighty mouse and the way they talk to each other in the corner, and you realize like there's a system they're operating under and they're like, this is very high level, very technical, very sophisticated. They're staying one step ahead of everything and they know what they're doing. For Demetrius. Demetrius, a very cerebral, smart fighter. So that doesn't necessarily mean my peers can spiel plugin and work. That's true to my pastor would do great somewhere like uh, with uh, Jason Parillo in San Diego. That could be fucking a dope connection for them or to find that right. Coach alliance. San Diego would be great too. I feel like that'd be good for him down there. There's always good spots, man. But I think that uh, having a fresh look is not the worst thing in the world, but I think you can't have too many fresh. Right. So you gotta you gotta put your roots somewhere, otherwise you might learn his box. Jaeger. Mark Henry. Yeah. Wow. Phenomenal coach. One of the masterminds. Yeah, he's one of the masters. Barboza Edgar. Eddie Alvarez

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       also owns a pizza place. Yeah. Is that, yeah, that's my guy. That was his, that was his pizza place. You said it was really good. The best. He actually tapped you actually send me a text after you ate that pizza and you go, I hate the best cause we are talking about choline is PTA goes, I ate the best pizza in the world bro. I was like, well that's a random tax question. I don't give a shit. It's a different pizza. I hate to be in that guy. But bagels and pizza or different over there, different water, they say, right. It's different. It's a different moisture in the air on my diet. I've been so good on my diet and getting, you know, losing weight for my special, but I've been good on my diet. What are you doing? This special, different, fascinating extra cardio.

Speaker 2:          01:56:20       Say How many hours a week? Uh, man, I wake up at six and then I, I quit eating at 6:00 PM at night, so 66 and then I don't eat until usually 10 or 11 the afternoons. So wow. But anyways, um, anyway, so, uh, I've been good on my diet, but I go to New York next week and artichoke pizza or King's pizza, I think it's called King Street. I just can't turn it down. Artichoke pizzas. Your Shit. No, the company's called our children. I fucking hate artichoke. The white pizza. The white sauce. Now that's not part of the shit. You don't like that stuff? Fuck No. I got to have red sauce man. But our choke pizza New York. My mouth's watering bro. Just some places that have good white pizza. I didn't experience the whole pizza until I had it at Nikki's in white plains or she's pizzeria in white plains, New York on the street right down the street from executive billiards. They had white pizza that will knock your dick write in the dirt. It had melted butter and garlic on it and and ham and shit and you'd bite and he'd be like holding. A lot of Italians were in white white plains. I mean he still to, this is not my favorite is white castle. Is White Castle still around? I remember white castle or small burgers. Burgers they make are Regan one grow. They make it Vegan. White Cow. Fuck yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:57:37       I'm pretty sure white castle for only then make a Vegan Burger. Now White Castle does, which is like, that's literally like buying a, a vitamin from a poison factory. That's a bad idea. Vitamins too. Yeah. Yeah. Bad at night. If you're a Vegan and like you're buying Vegan Burgers, soy from a company that rounders, millions of animals a year. Impossible Burger. You feel better. Wow. How about Taco Bell? Taco bell puts essentially sand it while sodium bicarbonate, Bro. Hey, no silicon by carbon. I think I'll still go there. There be filling. They're not allowed to call it beef filling. They have to call it Taco filling because it's not beef. That beef has silicone in it to make it fuller and more. Um, look it up. That shit. That shit is delicious. Oh, look up what's in Taco Bell. How would you doubt that? Why do you, how would you need for this Taco Bell Taco?

Speaker 1:          01:58:45       That's a conspiracy theory. A double decker Taco. I don't give a fuck you bro. There's no youtube blame. It's not real. Is calen true? Where'd you hear this? Silica. Silica. Brian, I believe you were talking about Taco Bell. It's not in their isolated oat product. Some chili pepper, onion powder, silicon dioxide, anti caking Asia. Now look that up. So carbon dioxide, sugar, please. Agent, how about that? You guys love Taco? Okay, go guys. What does it say? Anti kicking nature to avoid clumping and supplements. It's used to prevent the various powdered ingredients from sticking together as many food additives. Consumers have often often have concerns about silicon dioxide as an additive. Is it safe? Is it Sam to see that that they put in there also frequently found in health food nutritional supplements as an additive cells. Silicon dioxide primarily functions as an anti kicking agent, which prevents ingredients from binding together, but it doesn't say if it's cancerous carcinogen.

Speaker 1:          01:59:52       Look at this proven carcinogen. Well who set on Mcdonald's? Answer their buns. So silk industrial side is he proven carcinogen wives, Mcdonald's opt to use this in buns, potentially hurting human health. Silicon is categorized as a trace mineral then, which means that it's needed in minimal amounts to maintain health as his requirement. It's very small. It's recommended daily allowance for silicon has not been specified cause this is not food. However, experts suggested a daily consumption and the range of 2030 milligrams is needed to stay healthy. Who I wrote that cause that Mcdonald's, Mcdonald's [inaudible] I guess just a trace mineral maybe. But maybe it is. Yeah, it's important for sure. But you know it has, you know, if kid has like a slimy thing on it. Here's the thing. If they can't really say all this, if it's not true, if they do, they get in deep shit.

Speaker 1:          02:00:50       So it might be real that silicon is a trace mineral. It's an important part of our own feed. But it also, you're putting dirt in your burgers. Crow. It's also a food food grade. So maybe it's different. So it's like why is it in there though? Even if you, you're saying it so Katie, it doesn't kick up right? You can't have a cookie. Can have cake filler man. 36% beef. Oh it's only 36% beef and talked to other 64% is a wide range of fillers. It cocoa powder over this 36% beef, 64% is made with fillers. Don't we all know and preserve of know that this is 100% beef cow killed. You really think it was 64% I don't think when I eat that, I'm like, listen man, this isn't

Speaker 2:          02:01:40       going to be good. I'm going to shit my pants, but I love their fucking tostadas status. Have you heard that conspiracy theory that Mcdonald's, you know it says hundred percent beef that that's an actual trademark name, hundred percent and beef. Is that for real? We're just not. Don't they can say that? Then they can get sued? No, no, no. It was like a, it was like their beef. They're called beef even though it's 40% right. That's the conspiracy theory. So I don't know. I don't really know if that's true. Is Mcdonald's is same as Taco bell in terms of like what percentage of it is actually beef up their chicken? The one thing that's really weird about it, that's not the one thing that's fucked up about the beef. You getting hamburger from the thousands. Those cows can come from 10 different parts of the globe. So you're eating the the cows from China, Argentina, United States.

Speaker 2:          02:02:32       Who gives all his cows were killed and killed. Then it's brought together. So one cab, Bro. I don't give him my burner has come from ice to know cow's name. I have to, I'll tell you though, I think the healthiest, healthiest thing for you at Mcdonald's doesn't make no oil. Fish is made from real food change. The label fishes. Awesome. Have you had a MCRIB? Those are real ribs. You know they take me to present, rebuild. They take me and form it as a fucking, is that true? Let's read the Mcdonald Mcdonald things. Not True. I love make that larger. Please. I want a fish sandwich, Eddie. Well, smaller again, so it fits the screen. There you go. Whether it's a fascinating premise, there is nothing to at Mcdonald's. Hamburger patties in the u s are made with 100% us da inspected beef. They're cooked to prepare with salt, pepper and nothing else. No preservatives, no fillers to punk. So it's pretty healthy. It's debunked. How's that possible? That's 100% what are your top of that site? What is the title of it? Our Mcdonald's hamburgers hundred percent beef taco bell. Get on that train. They're just like, Nah, fuck. And they're like, fuck it. We just get, you know it's Shitty for you. Yeah, they're way worse than Mcdonald's.

Speaker 2:          02:03:45       Mcdonald's buys their meat from a company called 100% beef. That's not true. That's not true. Well that's the conspiracy ball thing. It's false. So it is. Look man, you could probably get beef pretty God damn cheap if you do it that way. Just grinded all day. I still like del Taco and all that stuff is so gross. But if you go to a real taco spot bromine, you have a at Mcdonald's, Mcdonald's fuck up. I will fuck up an egg mcmuffin and we'll fuck of it. I think it's an egg. Here's the thing, if you get egg mcmuffin with ham, they really can't fuck with that. You get that sausage. Who knows what's in that shit on. But if you get curious now the eggs actually and lately they that they make there what the egg Mcdonald's said that they, that the amount chickens and eggs they use now, they don't have, I think they don't use antibiotics.

Speaker 2:          02:04:47       The kick tinny eggs that are freshly cracked in Mcdonald's restaurants. That's impressed. The chains. Egg items such as scrambled eggs and egg whites are made from liquid eggs. But so that's what you go. Will you go with the regular chicken or you go with a regular egg? Mcmuffins who doesn't get egg on their egg muffin? I'm gonna just get to the sausage patty. Well, the sausage patties, you don't know what you're getting with that taste like bacon. No sausage. White Chase. They're scientists and they're working on tastes for real. They do a good job on it. We're do a good job soaked in syrup. What about that? You're talking about, let me grill McGriddle it's brilliant. It's brilliant. It's candy. Candy had an fair should. It's very good. I like it. I feel good when I eat it. Who the fuck whores flail fish filet of fish.

You go to an Italian Deli in Boston or New York and where they have the hands hanging from the ceiling where the guys at 90 year old guy can get that base cities in Vancouver, the basic cracked the fucking place on mother as good as it gets, have a red is shit down your throat. It's delicious. It's unbelievable. There's some spots bases. Unbelievable. Why don't more people do that? Like when you go to a real Italian restaurant or real Italian sub shop and you get like sausage and peppers with tomato sauce. Damn, I'm so good. You're like, okay, who? Why don't they figure out how to sell this more places? No, I know. Quality is expensive, Bro. It is, but it's so God damn. You're like, okay, well all these like little cheeseburger spots. How come you can't have a sausage peppers hoping in Hoboken, New Jersey in the 90s all Italian. You'd go to those fucking Dallas and they'd had the water Mozzarella. They're making it in the back. They'd make the Mozzarella and they put that shit on a, an Italian sub get, oh my. What's that right there? Send genero seats engineer's face. Yeah. Yeah. That's a little little. And they always have these big sausage vendors. Just giant grill sausages laid out. You're walking by and you get one and immediately just delighted.

Speaker 4:          02:09:08       Just busted in your mouse. Oh my God. Did the bread bread. It's just got this density to it. And you're like, Holy Shit. You guys ever fuck with the kitchen sink cookie? What's that? The kitchen sink cookies. All ingredients are in the cookie at Panera bread. They got a cookie called the kitchen sink. It's five bucks, dude. This is a good thing. Only usually fucking chocolate chip cookies. I don't fuck with Colton meal or cinnamon cookie. It's gotta be a good chocolate chip cookie. I mean, maybe some peanut butter in there, but kitchen sink has fucking everything and it's addicting as fit. You've got to be high, right? No, no, no, no. You know what? There was a Panera, Panera bread next to chipotle I, so I go to chipotle and go get the salad. No fucking no burrito. I'm going with the south site clean.

Speaker 4:          02:09:51       I clean it. Chipotle, and then the Panera bread's right next door. And I'm like, should I just walk to my car and just get in and drive the fuck away or am I going to go next door and fuck this all up and get a kitchen sink? So I've always had to struggle. I go to chipotle and I'm eating like an Olympian at AAA and then I walk out and sometimes they get in my car just fucking burn rubber and I'm out. But it's, it's been, uh, a problem of mine. But luckily, luckily, luckily I struggle with the same. Seriously. I had a salad. No, that's not it. I had a salad and I walked out and I was know I was on the fence of whether I should get a kitchen sink. And I said, fuck it. I'm going to get it. And I walked next door and the place closed down probably for like, Holy Shit was a legit,

Speaker 2:          02:10:34       totally, I feel good now. Now there's, I don't, I don't have a choice. What are you showing us? These are the rocks. Cheat meal cookies. Have you seen him? He goes to the flyers to some special place in Hawaii. Just for them. They're like fun cooking. It's like a cookie instead of cookies. I eat six ounces. I'm going to one of the islands. What are you doing out there and comedy son. Damn. No, I'm going to in Hawaii, man. Wow. Who or some shit going bro. Tollhouse cookies telling us closer to the Philippines or something. Right. Is it specific? Was it closer to Hawaii or closer to the foot? Closer to the, I think it's closer to Hawaii. I think it's like a thousand miles. It's pretty far, but how does anyone starving and yeah, I know him. I know a Mexican spot. It's like a legit, a Mexican spot.

Speaker 2:          02:11:29       Not that one I threw up at, right? No, no, no. Remember that front one Italian style. It's still there. Yeah. We hit the bomb too hard. We got a stomach. When was this? Many, many, many years ago. More than that. More than 10. More than 10 like 18 it was hot as fuck during the day. Empty stomach. We're about to go eat, get some burritos, and he wanted to stop at a head shop and get a bong. So he got them bomb and all yet. And I was thirsty as fuck. It was hot. We decided to hit the bottom before I went to the burrito place and suburbs, hottest fucking all he had in him. He had a case of red bulls, right stomach. I took two cause every little, so I took to, that was, it was high. I was thirsty, hit up, got gigantic dragon head, this bond, we walked, we walked to caffeine, caffeine, stomach empty sounds a big one.

Speaker 2:          02:12:26       That a real bad experience. So we walk into the Burrito shop and nobody was ever that. We'd walk and we were always the only, the only people. So it was like, how the fuck are they making money? Are they like bringing food from home? You know what I mean? But anyways, the room started spinning. I thought like I was gonna throw up and I just walked out of that place and just, I needed to find a bush. And I, as soon as I walked off like 20 yards, I saw Bush and I thought, I'm not going to make it, man. And I made a fucking beeline for the bush, but then I collapsed halfway through on my hands and knees, just puking all over the sidewalk and I'm trying to drag myself. And then I puked here. I took a couple more crawls, steps had puked again three or four times. I finally got to the Bush, had a couple more, a couple more, uh, um, uh, ounces for the bush. And then I felt great after I threw up, I felt great, but man, I left the crime scene all over there. Go back and eat again. I left the place. He's, he's freaking out. He's like, I got to go outside. I gotta check, I gotta find a Bush, I'm going to Puke. I'm like, no way. He goes outside of, I wasn't sure,

Speaker 4:          02:13:32       like, what do I do? Do I order the fleet? Do I help them? Do I wait? So, and then I was like, how serious is this? And I went outside. He's on his hands and knees. Pukes flying out of him. He's crawling behind the corner to what? He's his work and he's hurl and into the bushes. Wait, this is ridiculous. Jimmy Chin. We're barbecued. I mean, so the whole is this, this isn't the same Mexican place. You were just talking about different stories. This the other place, they don't even speak English to them to take you guys to, they didn't even speak English. I'm driving. It's phenomenal. I'm driving from central park. I'm driving from Calabasas is just down the PCH and it's just a windy, you know, through Topanga Canyon kind of, well, I had Jimmy Burke in the car who doesn't drive in cars. He lives in New York City.

Speaker 4:          02:14:13       So he is used to walking or riding his bike. He never drives in cars. So as we're going down, I'm just taking it for granted and I'm just seeing zing. Zing, zing though he, and he goes like this, hey, we get to the bottom. He goes, has Baba you gotta pull over right now. I go, why? He goes, I think I'm going to die. Go. What happened? He goes, you're swerving. He got out. He was on his hands and knees and we waited there for 45 minutes cause he couldn't get back in the car. That's how fucked up and threw up and just kept throwing up. Brian Killen you ever think you drive like an asshole? No. No. He just wasn't used to it. Jesus. Maybe I just hugged you ever. If you're super sick, if I'm on my phone in the car, you a driver to, you're going to back on my phone. I can read those either. Don't. Don't try to read a book with ears. I get so sick when I do that. You have to put my phone down to concentrate on the horizon. Just slowly dissipate, but just focus on the horizon. I get so sick with that. I can read in a car if you ever got seasick and I can read. I can fuck what? Whoa, whoa dude. While you're driving or what? Someone else, I get sucked in the back.

Speaker 4:          02:15:20       So the idea that you would be driving one of those cars and it runs out of batteries is what scares me the most. I've had it happen where a, that's a lie. It never happened, but I was having a cigarette and I just made it into my driveway. I remember. Yeah, I remember we were someone you have to stop and charge it to look up a charge plus zero gets you. How long? Uh, I've only like couple miles on zero. So you don't want to fuck with it. But I, I, it happened to me twice very recently where I pulled into my, to Sony and they plugged it in. I was zero and zero, but soon it takes forever. It takes forever to fucking charge. Fill up. Yeah, man, it's a bummer for hours, you know, we'll get you, you need six hours to get a hundred for a hundred percent. Really seven hours.

Speaker 4:          02:16:07       Right. Wow. Yeah. Depending on, and if you were on the charger, if you got that Tesla charger, you got an hour here, an hour even less. Can you get this at your crib? That's like, I saw them at the movie theater the other day. Yeah. They can't get those movies. You see, uh, we saw the, um, the new record mouth reg urology. Yes. It's very, take my kid out of my weird though, Sarah Silvermans divorce voice to this little girl. And so obviously Sarah sub, she's great in it. Yeah. But it's so obviously her to me, I'm like, Oh, Hey Sarah. I liked her one hour. I saw half of it anyway. I really liked the shit. She all, she seen her murder. She's such a good comp store. Silver. Very, very good comment. Yeah. I think maybe the best, best female female. That's what I mean. Yeah. Dude.

Speaker 4:          02:16:55       Trevor Noah's special on Netflix. It's funny as fuck isn't it? It's really funny. I heard mixed reviews. Really? Yeah. Since you said that. But I mean, you know, it's all, it's awesome. Jackie made me laugh. It's awesome. Type of a car. Brian judges you. It's true. Maybe you don't like the same humor now. Isaiah fury the purple car. Uh, it's just like two peacocks. Peacocky it's just like, hey, he's the way he dresses. He just, I know what he's going to do. Like I know that that one Porsche wasn't enough and he's like, I got a picture, it'll just, he'll just send me a random picture. And I'm like, don't you fucking do it. Of course he needs the purple. Do you think if you got rid of this Tesla, and I know you want to have a car that has a back seat where you could take your kids and you drove a nine 11.

Speaker 4:          02:17:37       I've driven one. When was the last one I drove Arnold Schwartzenegger nine 11 Porsche turbo. When was that? As he put it up for sale and my friend and he said, I got a surprise for you in 88 or some shit. Two thousands, 2000. It's a great car. But the problem is it's, it's, it's just a lot. I think it was a stick, you know, and traffic and shit. I'm just too lazy. I'm not a driver. You have to order a stick. Most of them don't. This head, uh, this had a special interior. Like it was beautiful car. Yeah. What I'm saying is it causes drove one. If you drove like a nine 11 and automatic one, amazing. You would love it, I'm sure. But then again, I really love that test. I think my lease is up. So the question is to really get a Panamera.

Speaker 4:          02:18:21       What do I get? When's the lease up? March. But I can trade it in or writing. Well you know there's benefits to both, right? There's benefits of the electric thing is it's pretty dope. It's fast as shit. Yeah. Off the line. There's no gears. Right. So just like there's no shifting. You don't care about speed. I like pickup. I like pickup and I liked the fact that it parks itself and I liked the fact that it drives itself. And once the traffic, if I'm in traffic I'll go like that. I hit this thing and I just stand. The editors drives in bumper to bumper and I never have to touch the wheel. So yeah, I hear you now, but you're going slow. You're not stop and start. That's tiring. It's annoying. Yeah. Have your hand on the wheel a little bit lightly and just, you can read a book. I don't know about that drive the goddamn color. Once you have cars driving for you, it's the future. But we're all going to be eventually it will. Yeah. Kids aren't gonna get drivers driver license or way down. There's like Uber's, why would we drive you old fuck really? Uber everywhere. Yeah. Driver's in getting drivers. Uber, Uber. It's is a little dangerous because those Uber drivers is weird as fuck. Gonna have driverless. Uber isn't, then

Speaker 2:          02:19:28       we're just going to get in no way. You're going to let a car drive itself like on this new Tesla has so many cameras. Like it just parked for me. Like the download I, I went, I called my buddy goes, cause you know this works. My Buddy Jeff and I go, no. And he goes, watch this. And I pushed this park. I stood there, it parked it parallel, parked so fast and well, so much better. I didn't have to do, I sat there and it just went. I was like, are you made me feel like less of a man? But you get lazy. It's just easy. After a while. That's ridiculous. Hit a button. That's so sounds like what people probably said when the printing press came out. I know you're not going to write your words. You're not going to get no, no. I'm not talking about pride or anything like that.

Speaker 2:          02:20:13       I'm, you're going to be driving on the freeway 65 miles. That's eventually she's going to get so good. No, I don't. I don't. That would make me eventually fall. That makes me way more than other people. There's so many accident, dumb asses. They're reading their phone. It was some lady should someone else car that I'm in reading hard that I'm in because she didn't know. Traffic just goes in the Middle Lane, middle and just stopped dead. A woman I work with, her mother was killed by a distracted rights and driving killed, killed her mother. They say it's going to take over drunk driving. Everything takes him driving to be number. Every time I see someone driving fucked up, I always pull up next to him and they're always on their phone. Oh, it's like 89 90% of the time. It's not the other. It's just people just should.

Speaker 2:          02:20:57       They should make it so that your phone doesn't work while you're driving. Right. You're throwing shot this an option in the new iPhones, there's an option to locks. Locks you out of everything. Yeah. When he takes those. I'm driving right now and we'll give you a tech. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, one of these days it might be mandatory. Right? Well, she cannot be on your phone while you're driving, unfortunately by take a tragedy. That is, well that is a law. That is a lot good hands free system. You can do a lot of shit. Like I can press the little button on my steering wheel and say Call Eddie Bravo and it'll call. You can, I'll say tech teddy probably read it. Will read text to you to read text. See if you have apple carplay. Yup. But then the problem is if you started making rechecks, what does that read? Read?

Speaker 2:          02:21:46       Brian said Dick Pic. Yeah. What'd you like to reply? No. Okay. That's kind of cool. It's kind of weird though. It's, it's, it's, they're going to have something. This is whatever this is. This is going to be nothing compared to whatever they settle on 10 years. When the fuck are we getting flying cars that's never going to take it's spine. Remember your joke about it? Your bitch. I haven't heard it. It's great. It's on your new, you know, 2006 no one or two. Nobody else did, but it didn't get on something. Oh, okay. I went from 99 to 2005

Speaker 4:          02:22:26       there's a lot. There was a long gap or I didn't film anything. That's where that step. It's from 99 to 2005 special. Yeah. Why'd you do that? Too busy. That was the fear factor. Gotcha. You weren't grinding with comedy, so you know we're supposed to have those. I was doing a lot of spots at the store 30 years ago, traveling on chips on chips like 1978 1980 that, that um, jet packs back then and we still haven't mastered yet, but they're getting pretty good though. I have suggest patios. Yes. I have seen, yeah, that they're getting better now. I've seen it. I saw a guy in the NFL invest half of his salary in the flying cars. This was in 2000 throw. No. Yeah, he's not doing well. God didn't work out flying cars. Jesus Christ. Yeah. That's not going to happen. I'm going to get ahead of the curve.

Speaker 4:          02:23:21       Oh, just something like that. Getting off the ground, getting approved, getting licensed, not dropping out of the sky. Can we structure 80? We didn't think, you know, in 2018 we'd still have cars with rubber tires, engines and basically the same thing. Some countries are making gas cars by 2020. But what the Craig leading is, what are you saying this? Yeah, no, they're not going to release the saddle gas cars. Yeah. Don't make them illegal. Oh, what about retro cars? Like are you allowed to keep your car from like 1980? I'm not sure. China, China in one year decided that uh, their air was terrible and one year they basically said that you're going to use natural gas instead of like a coal and stuff like that in your home. And, uh, I think it was what it was trying to have the advantage of just going, hey, all you billion plus people no more.

Speaker 4:          02:24:13       And they changed it in a fucking year. They just literally just change the infrastructure so that they'll be the first ones because they don't think electric. All of China. Yeah, look that up. We still have coal plants and shit. Well they do but, but people were using, uh, things like coal and gas are fuel to cook their food, to heat their homes and, and basically the president said, Nah, natural gas, clean burning gas. No more changed it in a year. There is a lot better because the area was pretty bad, but they said the air was the worst in Beijing. One thing about UC in Beijing is nothing but unfinished buildings. They'll build 20 of the same exact looking building in one area and it's so ugly. These giant buildings and that's the landscape and they're empty or just cranes and they're not working. They overbuilt a lot.

Speaker 4:          02:25:06       Why'd they do that? They have ghost cities. They have huge cities where nobody lives in them because they were essentially saying, let's just build as many cities as we can, but they didn't have the population to move them in or the or the economy to support that city. It's like North Korea to have a bunch of empty created. Is that a, all somebody has to take a product of communism versus capitalism cause capitalism, they would have had to have some sort of financial plans. Yes. It's a command. It's a command economy. Right, so, so why not just create jobs, create jobs. If everybody's working, just build a bunch of buildings. Nobody has to live in them, but just as long as we got people going in downtown La, it's kind of like that. They're building that new skyscrapers all the Goddamn time for selling the shit out of them.

Speaker 4:          02:25:52       Yeah. That's the difference. A marketplace dictates you have dealt with developers to take huge risks and they say, I'm going to build this in the hopes that I can fill that retail space, office space. China, Ned does not the same pressures. You know, China's an economy of influence to a lot of times you're not doing business unless you've got, you know, connections with the people that okay, your permits, et Cetera. I mean fuck was so lucky. We don't live in a dictatorship like that. Like if you're stuck under the boot of something like North Korea and you stuck and we could, could've got a shit roll the dice of course born in there about an all the time. Especially because I lived in those countries as a kid. Right. You, you, you, we take a lot of our freedoms for granted, but at the same time they're always under threat.

Speaker 4:          02:26:39       You know, I think from, from companies like the fact that so much information is it's concentrated in so few companies like Facebook, like Google, I worried they have, yes, they have critical. That's the real issue. The real issue is that they have, they lean politically and they almost should be completely neutral and just allow or not allow things based on whether or not it violates the rules. But that's not really the case. No. And also the way, the way campaign finance works, like the way you have to have money, it's changing a little, but if you don't have money as a politician, you better say what your financing to the people that are financing and commit campaign. They'll tell you, they'll give you a sheet on what to say. If you don't do that, you're not in Congress. The next time you were out you, you, you know you, you, you have to listen to the people that put you there and that's a problem.

Speaker 4:          02:27:32       It costs a lot of money to get elected. It's just you. You've got to have very clear rules if you're going to have rules in terms of like what you can and can't say. They have to apply to everyone regardless of race, regardless of gender, ethnicity, and they don't like, one of the things that Bret Weinstein tweeted the other day that I retweeted was some woman who, who wrote all white people are racist and she just went on this, this anti white screed. Like you just can't say that. That's dumb. That's a dumb generalization. And it's racist. And you don't think it's racist because it's racist against white people, but it's racist. It's so stupid that you allow that, but you don't allow racism against other races. What's funny is that they're thinking the same way. Their methodology is the same as the people they're criticizing. Yeah. Susan has cracked ribs.

Speaker 4:          02:28:21       Is that what you think? It's how you think that makes it more of a difference. Right. So you're thinking like a racist. I know that you have a different kind of racism, but it's still racist. Well, they think it's justified their shitty way of doing the math. Yeah, it's not, they're not that smart. That's the other thing is that one's about, it's been sitting there for three hours. It's coffee, but the, but the way you get elected, stay elected as you, you tow the Utah though. Like if you're, if you want to have sort of Anti Wall Street legislation, certain things. So swipe fees, swipe fees on your ATM, that was, that's a huge issue and it doesn't affect a lot of us, but it affects, uh, corporations, a bank's bottom line. And that becomes, you better. You better vote favorably or you're going to, you're going to have a problem.

Speaker 4:          02:29:07       But I think more and more Americans are realizing that money in politics is a big problem. It is just how the fuck would you ever get it out? I Dunno. It's always been that way. The question is, does your government represent you? Right, right. So gerrymandering and how campaigns are financed, drives me nuts out quiet. Eddie is turn all I'm thinking about distinguished gentlemen. Remember Eddie Murphy when he became a politician? I don't remember that one is old school man. I see that one. I might not have said that might be the one that I've never said he wanted to be a politician because they found out the damn that's, that's where you make the money. So he, well you man, Tony Latex, just like, you know, just taking bribes and all that shit. But then he gets a conscience. He does the right thing at the end.

Speaker 4:          02:29:49       But a congressmen spans a US congressman spends between 30 and 70% of his time or her time on the phone to people they don't know, trying to raise money. Okay, so and you're not allowed to do it on government property. So what you do is you go across the street, you're sitting in your car, you can go across to you in the capital, they're in their car and they're making phone calls, they're given a list and you make a phone call and you spend 30 to 70% of your time doing that to raise money. There's something wrong with that. That's kind of fucked up, but it's, you got to do that. Whenever I hear people talk too much about politics, even myself included my own words, I'm like, you're talking about like a rigged game. It's like you're, it's like you're talking about pro wrestling.

Speaker 4:          02:30:27       It's like you're talking about something that's you pretending that it's real, but you know what you know, you know, of course the government is corrupt as fuck, but when you're talking about stuff like that, like it are the election's rigged or do our votes count? The one thing that I learned from this, this, these midterms is that if your vote didn't count and it was an and a, it's all decided like pro wrestling. Then there wouldn't be all this voter fraud and all these computers that can, you know, I'm talking to them. I'm not sure I'm going to have to get a boat. I'm talking about the way once you're in office, the way things get. Nothing. No, no, no. I get it. But what I'm saying is from, from uh, the elections, you see that your vote's do matter. There's a lot of corruption and fraud going on.

Speaker 4:          02:31:15       But if it was all rigged, like WWE, they wouldn't need to do all that was, you're right. So it's still, it's still the real system, right? Because a lot of people think it's not a real system. Like it doesn't matter. They already decided and they're just going to put them in. No. The way they, they actually decide is, is they decide who they're going to rig the machines for, but the vote still counts. You just got to make sure that there's no, uh, you know, shenanigans going on votes. Right. Certainly do count. But what would, where it gets really squirrely, and this is where politics get goofy, is in, why do politicians do what they do? Do they do what they do to support the people or do they do what they do? Because special interest groups of infant to way more. But not only that, here's what's really, wow.

Speaker 4:          02:31:57       So, so Capitol Hill, when you're in Congress, they call that the farm team. Because in cabinet, hell, you spent six years, seven years, let's just say, or a senator. Now, when you're a senator for, I dunno, 10 years, when you're on capital hill for as a congressman for six, for 10 years, you develop real connections and relationships with government officials who make decisions. You also understand how government works. You understand who's actually influencing who. So now what do you do? So let's say you lose an election, or let's say you decide, I bet I made my hundred and 60 grand a year, can't really live on that money. You go to k street, you join a lobbying firm and, and because you've been there for six or nine or 10 years, you know a lot of people and that lobbying farm goes, hey, we'll pay $1 million now.

Speaker 4:          02:32:46       And all you gotta do is drive to Capitol Hill every day. Get in there and influence, use your connections so that we, we can get what we want from government. So corporations hiring lobbying firms to lobby for their bottom line. So now you're working to influence government. And the problem is when you're in Congress, you know that, you know you have a job waiting. If you can make great connections and now Washington becomes an economy of influence. That's the game, right? Yes. I'm fucking, you gotta have a Lawrence Lessig on your Goddamn podcast. He can explain it. He's a Harvard professor and that motherfucker keep telling me about the podcast you did with him. He'll break it down. I did. Yeah. Listen to that. I'll say I sent it to you. I think it's Lawrence Lessig. He's, he's, he breaks it down. He wrote a book called Republic lost and he's got a couple of Ted talks.

Speaker 4:          02:33:34       But that dude, yes. And basically he said your government doesn't represent you and here's why. Here's how it works. When he breaks it down and you go, it's simple the way he breaks it down cause he's a constitutional scholar at Harvard and you're like, fuck it, the kid. And what he said was fascinating. He said, Washington's a place where even if you're a good person, you must behave in a corrupt manner if you want to survive. And that's when you have problems when good people have to behave. Corruptly yeah, yeah. The bright side of all of that then fed the bright side of all that is uh, the fact that there is like people getting suicided and bribery going on, that that means that there's hope, that there's good people inside the government that you got to watch you gotta your ass. You know, we're going to have, we got to hire someone to kill you because we don't want to go to jail.

Speaker 4:          02:34:21       So the fact that all that's down it kill you, they can just get you out. Or what I'm saying is the fact that there is all that bribery and suiciding, that means that there's good people in there that are, are going after, uh, the bad people. But to me, I look at the bright side. I used to think there was no hope. I used to think fuck am like when, when the bushes were an office, Clinton, Obama, I was like, I didn't pay attention to shit. I just said they're all corrupt. It's all rigged and it's all, you know, there's nothing you could do about it. But um, you know, over the last couple of years, you know, since Trump got into office now I'm like paying attention. My, there are some good people trying to do some good shit. Like Trey Gowdy. Listen to that motherfucker. Trey Gowdy is a bad motherfucker.

Speaker 4:          02:35:07       What are you talking about? Gates? No politician with the congressmen. Oh Man. They're great people going after the bad people. That's why there needs to be bribes and suiciding and blackmail. The reason there's black males, because there's good people in there. If everybody was bad, they would. Why would you blackmail any, the problem is it's really subtle the way they can get you out though. Because when your donors are telling you which way to vote, you're you as a politician going there with all your ideas and you can't vote your conscience. There's a lineup and she got a lot of bad shit. You've got to show the money. You're preaching to the choir over here. I'm not, I'm not going to defend. So you fix that. So, so Lawrence Lessig has, one of the ideas he talks about is anonymous donations. So, so watch your a politician.

Speaker 4:          02:35:49       I'm a corporation. I give your a or an eye through a super PAC or whatever it might be. I give your campaign a lot of money. Now you're a regular dude. You're not corrupt. But human beings, when somebody gives them a real hand when they needed it, you can't help but to feel a little indebted. Of course. What if all, what if there are two ideas? What if you add a voucher system with all of us were given a certain amount of money every election cycle and we were allowed to anonymously to give that money to whoever we thought was a viable candidate. It'd be anonymous. Or what if all donations were anonymous? What if you didn't, if you couldn't say who it was from, but if you know you've got a lot of stuff from GE or you know you've got a lot of stuff from Lockheed and there's a bill that comes up for Saudi Arabia to buy a bunch of tanks or whatever or or weaponry, it's going to be very hard for you to vote against that.

Speaker 4:          02:36:41       And if you do, those people that got you in power last time aren't going to get you. Empower the, basically figured out a way to make bribing legal. This is just the way it works, Bro. Take care of you and you add money to your campaign, but then don't exactly tell you what to do, right? But you know, read the book to read is republic lost fucking good because it on the audio. Yes. It's amazing. And get, get Lawrence Lessig on your God damn podcast to break it down. All right, let's do it relaxed. I get excited about it because when you say campaign finance reform is so boring, right? Did I hear that? I go like this. Ooh, I've had a book, two books on it. I'm like, oh darn, I get bored. I get tired right away. But it's so important. They've got to figure out some way to stop these giant corporations from influencing politicians.

Speaker 4:          02:37:22       They've got to find some way it's gotta become illegal, influenced your money shows and everybody, there's money to be made no matter what the idea is that they want. So much so that anything that threatens that money, the real true marketplace they want, they want to put the fucking brakes to that. But you still have a kid supposed to cancel each other out though. So, so ideally it's nothing wrong with petition your government that's in the constitution. So you can lobby your government, it's called petitioning your guide, but her laptop donating money to your campaign. That's where it, that's where citizens United comes. Isn't lobbying illegal in some countries? Uh, probably the problem with lobbying, so says boy countries and legal and I think maybe a Holland. I think so. I think lobbying cause that's what a, but lobbying, the with making lobbying illegal is, it's part of free speech.

Speaker 4:          02:38:14       That's what it was ruled in the Supreme Court. So citizens United. So in other words, if I want to give money to you, you're a politician and you and I want to, I want Eddie Bravo to be president, right? I should be able to exercise my right as a citizen and support you, which means you want. So I want to amplify your voice. That means you need money. So to tell me I can't give money to the person I like is a restriction of free speech. And that I think is, I think that was the citizens United Supreme Court knows there's another problem. The other problem is when subjects like this get brought up, and this is one of the most important subjects that we could ever discuss, like how our world gets run. I get bored as fuck. I know you get bored as fuck. He turns out, I've been starting up the wall for the last 30 minutes.

Speaker 4:          02:38:56       I understand it's you don't want to have, you don't want to have to play. It affects all of us. Do you want to be like these I'm leaves over here dude. You going to do so into politics ever? I'ms depo changes. I love it. It's like game of Thrones, but it's for real and it affects your life. It does affect your life. Real Shit is real game of Thrones going on right now and it's so entertaining to find out what the fuck instead of watching it Goddamn TV show that does nothing for your life you're at. It's really like game of Thrones really going on right now. If they pay attention, attendance problem with John, season hundred and 11 watched TV shows so that I could just have fun. Yeah. I'm not saying don't do that. I'm not saying don't do that, but I don't think you can do both.

Speaker 4:          02:39:38       Those things freak me the fuck out. And you can do both. You can do both. But if you really start paying attention too much to politics and I have a bunch of friends that are really into policy, especially right now, and they could talk, let me ask all of you this. So, so as far as like not standing out of politics or whatever, what if this is where it comes down to? We off kids here, so now there is a legislative agenda, whatever it might be, and it's an agenda that says we want to, we want to teach your kids something like let's just say because the social scientists and academia wins their way. It gets into the air. Politicians was happens all the time and politicians say all schools, public schools at least where my kids go are going to teach that there's a zero biological difference or zero difference between men and women.

Speaker 4:          02:40:24       Oh and by the way, ready evolution is a theory and we're going to put it on the same standings as creationists theory too. I eat school board in Kansas I think at one point and had that going on. There are the frame each saying the same people that say, I'm just saying what happens? What happens if you, if you, if you stay out of this debate and the wrong people, when they push their ideas forward, which usually have a political agenda, you might be faced with a situation where somebody is trying to educate your kid, kid in things that you just not only disagree with factually incorrect so that this happens. This is where it starts getting personal. Yeah. It can get real weird. Like there was this thing from nature of the other day

Speaker 1:          02:41:07       that, uh, I retweeted cause Bret Weinstein Weinstein had, uh, brought it up and it was like, this is really disturbing that these people were making this distinction. It was talking about the difference between biological sex and uh, and real, I don't want to misquote it, so I'll find out the exact thing. But there's essentially promoting social justice principles over scientific principles. And it's supposed to be a company that specializes in science, right? So instead of just being scientific, there's scientific with a very clear progressive political twist to it. And you're like, well, just because something's in convenient, it doesn't mean it's incorrect. Just because something's uncomfortable doesn't mean it's not true. Right? And there's things that you might have your own personal beliefs and values and ethics, but that's not what we're counting on. When you're a science journal, we're counting on just facts. That's it. And they're not doing that.

Speaker 1:          02:42:08       Did you see the, I think I sent you guys are to thing to say this proposal has no foundation in science is nonsense. The genitals. So this is what it is. Like go to the pit, pull up the nature one first. I could read that the u s editorial, the u s department of Health and human services proposes to establish a legal definition of whether someone is male or female based on the genitals they are born with. This proposal has no foundation in science and should be abandoned. And this is the journal Nature though. So the problem with that is what Bret Weinstein very succinctly says, like to say in quotes, this proposal has no foundation in science, which is what they said he says is nonsense. The genitals. One one is born with show overwhelming correlation with one self assessed gender as predicted by evolutionary theory. If we grant nature's claim, we condemn the study of complex phenomena to a dark.

Speaker 4:          02:43:02       There you go and there's the class. Exactly. Sample and nature should know better, but they have a political agenda. Where'd that come from? They were influenced by forces probably on the radical left in this. In this instance, there are other sports is on the other side. That's where the wind is going and if you support that, you get way more love than you get hate, right? There's currency to it. You've lived finger you as prestige where the wind's going to say that there's no correlation is fucking bananas were all men and that's controversial. It's controversial to say it well. It's just a lot of nonsense going on right now that I think will eventually be sorted out once the dust settles, but I think this is just a wave of information. It goes left, it goes right. Everybody's battling it out and because people are more concerned with their side winning than they are with actual facts.

Speaker 4:          02:43:47       A lot of really stupid ideas get supported and instead of objectively analyzed for whether or not they contain Tris, push back with kids though. So my buddy, my buddy's son is 15 and he was like, it's all about gender and, and you know, educating you on gender and high school people choose their pronouns. So when you're in college, my nephew who was in college where I dealt with 18 years old, they said, I'd say your name and, and please tell us what pronoun you would like to be referred to class. Yes. Right. At first, first day or so. So now the kids, now the kids, now the kids though, as they're being taught this by their fucking teachers, cause they're kids, they're like the fuck out of here. So my friend goes, look at that and look at, look at butterflies and the beautiful and his son goes, Dad, do you have any idea how hurtful it is that butterfly, you have no idea what that butterflies gender is.

Speaker 4:          02:44:37       And they're all fucking around now. So if there's push back on that shit, well you know, you can't get to create some pushback kids. So some cause we can see there's some really influenced people easily influenced people that are adopting all the stars. Wait, yours. So than it was when we were growing. Of course, even if there's, especially in La, indoctrination is the right word. You can get kids to believe in anything. I use some MK Ultra and my son too. I said, you know what? I'm going to make him a Cleveland browns fan. We flew to Cleveland, the Cleveland browns and all he wanted was a baker, Mayfield Jersey. That's the one be like, Dad, I'm like fucking work once and be like, like dead. But that's what he likes. But that's what happens. You got into Cleveland browns on one trip. He's, it's hard though to keep a theory going that doesn't really have any basis in science.

Speaker 4:          02:45:24       At the end of the day it's, it's kind of banking a physical. I don't think they're very smart time. I think their political now, I don't think they're very smart and I don't think there's scholarship. There's this deep men, women people born as men, but think they're women. People born as women, cattleman, people that think they're both, that's five. It's very rare. What else? They said there's like 60 of them are 78 different gender pronouns, but that's because no one has agreed on what the gender Pronoun should be. So if you decide that yours is I are and I said, no, mine is z. Y. R. E like to explain, it's an obsession. What it is, there's, there are people that want to be special. This is a big part in whatever you got to go to. He's going to be Spanish. If you're a guy, come on. What do you got?

Speaker 4:          02:46:09       Take courses. I know you think you're a guy. You know what? I know you think you're a guy, but we're going to, you're going to, you know what? For sure. Harris said that I fucking loved. He said right now the one thing to keep in mind is that being offended is not an argument and it's not a virtue. So you can't just shut the conversation down because you're offended and you're taking issue with what I say. That ain't an argument and it sure as fuck ain't a virtue, but that's what's going on. When, what's her name? Heather Mcdonald's at her name. She was speaking at a, she was speaking at a college and there was a law student. He was just giving you the finger the whole time and all she was trying to do is talk about, you know, something that was based in science and Heather MacDonald.

Speaker 4:          02:46:51       What's her name? No, she's a, she's a professor at journalists, a professor of journalism I think. And uh, she's a very reasonable kind of like clear, I can't remember matter man. People are struggling so hard to find things to be offended at that they're pointing at targets that aren't viable and the, they're throwing all their weight into it and then when it doesn't work they back out and they try someone new. That's right. You know, Christina Hoff summers, you were some of the things that she did where she was trying to speak and they were shouting or going and making all this noise in the crowd trying to bu or off the stage. They try to silence people because it's something that you can do. You can get it done because they're afraid of their ideas. They don't think they're [inaudible] committee game man. It's a game.

Speaker 4:          02:47:33       They're on one side, she's in the other, it's a road for the browns. She's with the Raiders, right? That's what it is. Teams. It's 100%, which is, what are your feelings on the caravan situation? What do you guys think about that? Desperate people from all the people that are getting in here every day. Like what is this a full, it's a fake thing. We're supposed to be painting. Exactly happened with the Caribbean. So they're making a big publicity event out of these people that want to come to America. They came from, they want asylum, but they came from [inaudible], [inaudible] and this other gang are the big employers there. If you don't join them, you get your family killed. Nice guys. And I think that, uh, these people are desperate. They're essentially refugees from a place that's intolerable live, but they're making it this really big political deal.

Speaker 4:          02:48:16       It's very publicized, total. And apparently then always walking. Sometimes they get in the vans and people drive in place and let them in. I don't know who you'd say that we shouldn't let them in or we should, we'll load them in. This is what I'm saying. I'm saying what's the issue? Well yeah we definitely don't. People don't want them if they're illegal immigrants. Right. But what's interesting to me is like if you come from Cuba, you can just come. Yeah. You if you get on a boat and he get over here in America, but like you made it bro. Come on in. If you tried from Guatemala, Nah, sorry son. Ronald Patch at dirt. Find another. Don't take carpool because as a man, because it sounds really bad, but it's, it's fascinating. Double murders in New York and there's really made an agreement that anybody who's trying to escape the kind of shitty situation they have in Cuba will allow that.

Speaker 4:          02:49:03       Oh I got you. I got so loud that Columbia, I mean if you, if you're Yoel and you come over from Cuba. Yes, that's true. Yeah. Cause your comments, we'll take you. But people think that like all Mexicans are like for the caravan and to, you know, we want them, you know, that's not true. Most Mexicans are like immigration in another country. You, I ain't getting on welfare. You know what I mean? Mexicans ain't down for that caravan. They want them turned away too. It's a complicated emotional issue, man. It's like, I always do this joke where I believe in borders, but I'd be a shitty border control agent, right? Like I do think borders are reasonable, but I have nobody gets over. And then I'd be like, oh, the kids, fuck it. Come on on. Right. I think Americans feel that way at that.

Speaker 4:          02:49:45       You know, it's a, it's a hard to live in a gated community. No. Okay. I mean, yes. All right. No, it is, it's like the idea that there's a real country, that there's a place where you can go in a place where you can't go and like you have to have papers and they make a cross this line in the dirt, like they've set up fences and borders. Well, the surface needs reason that exists, right? I mean, if you think about the United States, right? The United States essentially is not just a country, it's a collection of different areas, right? In each different area has its own culture, their own almost their own language. You know, the way they talk and Florida way fucking different than the way they talk in Maine. It's really weird. It's all the same language, but it's almost like they're separate little countries and we travel amongst each other.

Speaker 4:          02:50:27       No problem. And you're allowed to, you're allowed to bail out of, I'm going to try and to Vegas for a while. I'm going to get me a job at the casino. Nobody cares. You're fine as long as you're honest, one patch of dirt. But the reason why we don't allow all the other patches that dirt to do the same thing and everybody just flow freely is because there's some spots that just don't have it good at all. And we want those people to stay there. Although you haven't thought, although your spot you haven't fixed, you know what the connected extra spot, but you know what the connective tissue is for Americans besides the, even though that's true, the connective tissue that I think a lot of countries don't have is that the one thing we have gone for it. Even if it's, even if it's a myth for a lot of people, the one thing all Americans have gone for him is, is now is the idea that there's a chance if I do the right thing, I may be poor now American, but I could be a fucking millionaire.

Speaker 4:          02:51:19       Their control. Yeah, for sure and shit is so, and but that's what keeps the sort of, that's what I have coming from running from creating a revolution. But if we lose that, if we let people start thinking that's not for them. Let everybody, right, right. You can't, you can let everybody in from Kentucky. If everybody from Kentucky decided to move to La, we would just have to deal with it. Lots of America, they got citizenship. That's what I'm saying. Like, it's not the reason why we can't have world citizens. Obs to some places suck too hard. You don't want to nationalism. I'm not saying that it's good or bad, I'm just looking at it as a thing right now. If I had to say, do I like it? Honestly, I think the whole world as the human beings as a race would be way better off if everybody could move where it's good.

Speaker 4:          02:52:01       And then we would figure out why. There's too many people where it's good and then he'll settle down and you move to a better spot. And then eventually even out. The reason why ever happened, but we never even reason why Tesla in segregated areas don't advance like these people in Sentinel Island. So kind of a fucked up example. So in Taiwan, they're not going anywhere like this is, they're wearing leaves over there. Dick for six. Do they do Joe? Really European Union, by the way. You and I are morons. Okay. If we were living on that island, we would be having leaves over our Dick too. It's not like, oh, I'm just going to vet a satellite, these fucking morons. Like we don't know how to do any of that stuff. So we would be with them just with a greater understanding of what's possible. But what you just said, it's happening in the European Union.

Speaker 4:          02:52:45       I mean that's why a lot of Polish people come out to the UK and they come back and you know, and there's also what they're doing now with immigration is freaking a lot of people out because they're allowing so many people of different cultures to come in and then there's cities become more multicultural than they are English. And then it gets real weird. The other problem is that when you have chain currency, currency is used to be based on the productivity of their citizenry, right? So when you have currency, everybody has the same currency, which means it's all value. The same thing. Problem is that people in Spain are not as productive as people in Germany, for example. So the German goods and services should be worth more or the dollar there that the euro there should be worth more than it is. Say, you know space better when the state has more power than the, than the Fed.

Speaker 4:          02:53:32       Well, it's like countries. That's basically what, because the argument is, is we're like a band of countries like California. Was the country better though? When isn't that better for the people is better. So then that would mean you know at the same rate, you know, it's better to have a country like the United States than to be well so said the Republicans with states, you can go to any state with countries, you can go to any country. You can't get an in Japan. I mean Japan. I mean, yeah, you can't get in there 10 Syrians I think or something. What'd you say? The Japanese took like 10 Syrians are trying to get him to Canada. I was gonna say kids these days, they have a, they have very liberal immigration. Kevin is obese. The living cause these celebrities, like I'm so sick of Dominican, his ways.

Speaker 4:          02:54:17       I'm headed to Canada. If you have a Dui and I'll let you win. It's true. It's apiece. Got To pay. That's crazy. Boys. Let's wrap this bitch that's wrap this up.

Alright, bye everybody. We love you guys and girls and everybody else. You guys want to go see Tito chuck the de facto?

Speaker 6:          02:55:51       No. Is it going to be on.
