You forgot your phone. I feel so fucking naked right now. It's never just awful. At least I just tracked it online so I'm keeping an eye on it. So it's kind of like looking at photos of my family, you know? It's like, it feels good that I know it's still alive like, you know, like I see it on Google maps and still alive listed. If I just tweeted what are the odds that Joe Rogan and Duncan trussell got so higher now having an amazing conversation without the podcasts running. It's true. I'm going to tweet one. Tweet that with 100 percent. Let's just plow through this commercial real quick so we can get started. The Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by.

Speaker 1:          00:01:04       I said pod cat high cat's podcast is brought to you by [inaudible] dot net. Click on the link for the flashlight and enter in the code name Brogan. You will get 15 percent off the number one sex toy for men. Dunkin, you'd go, you're going to enjoy. I got a new one for you. Excellent. What is it? It's, it's uh, uh, give it to you later. Really. Some girls, but all or something. Is it the Iron Lady? Good. Whoever it looks like a great little butthole. You're going to love it. Yeah. How do you know it's a girl's butthole? While they say they modeled them after the girls puzzling. It looks like a butthole. It's like they. Yeah, they do the vagina. They do the butthole. They, they actually make a mold. They're posting. That's why a lot of these freaks. Like these porn star chicks.

Speaker 1:          00:01:45       Yeah. They have their own flashlights. It's like molded after their own box. So there's a professional pussy mold or something looks on the outside like exactly what their box looks like. That's the weirdest jobs on teen back in Boston. I want to get inside a box. You got to touch a box. That's what dudes used to say a lot. The worst description. China, it's the least geometric shape on the planet is the last thing you want to fuck is a box is that Boston was a mess anyway. Did they do that when you were young? Was that box or. No, but I can remember. I can remember getting like sick. My mom was a psychologist that she like gave me like a, a sex book, like when I was trying to learn about sex and it was like lists of the, of the slang for pussy and I remember getting the box and it was like wracking my already vague understanding of what a policy wise because it's like I always at anything like a box. That's hilarious. It's more like a bag than a box. It's not like youtube either, but that's what the flashlight is. It's a tube. Well, it's a. it's a, it's a. it's. I don't want to do a fucking puppet show with flashlights. That's taking a hand puppet show with your hands.

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       You can make mount. I was thinking about taking the many flashlights you've given me and doing some kind of like Shakespeare, but how many do you have? Well now there's only two. Now. One of them is totally to now. One of them is, well no one of them. This is a gross story. I don't going to tell her what is a disgusting. Sorry I didn't clean one out and I left it sitting on top of the shower is a growth story and I like so, so I, uh, I can remember the smell. It's the smell is what I imagine these hives and starcraft smell like. It's like this just disintegrated alien. It's like the smell of it. Like you know, when the aliens, when they go down into that fucking in the very beginning, when they go into the pit where there's all the pods and the thing pops out and lands in the guy's face. It's in the very beginning of the movie alien. It's like a have seen it. That's what an old flashlight smells like when you open it. It's this kind of alien, pungent, muscular, primordial smell. But I opened it up and men who was just like black and dark is black ooze, just kind of drips out of it. And, and, and so I threw that one away.

Speaker 4:          00:04:15       Is it like, seriously dissonant? You'd have to disinfect that with so many chemicals. Have to worry about those chemicals eventually burning the skin off your deck. Well, yeah. And, and some unknown disease. Leprosy. That's where it gets born in the bottom of the fleshlight from some sick fucks. It never bothered to clean it. You tried to fuck it twice. That's the end of the world. The, the one, the one flashlight and there'll be told about on fucking big stone tablets 10,000 years from now, we've traced it back to a flashlight and there's only a few people survived. Only liked from one particular area of Ethiopia were able to handle it well. What dead?

Speaker 3:          00:05:01       I mean a flashlight is truly a breeding ground for bacteria if you consider it, especially if you keep it in the balmy atmosphere of your shower because you're combining fucking. You're combining so many bad elements thing and he makes him with heat.

Speaker 4:          00:05:16       Sure. And who knows what's in the water,

Speaker 3:          00:05:18       water supply DNA, your true life precursors in there. You could. It could sprout a new life. Jesus fucking Christ. Why not? Right? Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:05:28       mean we, we, we poo poo that. But could you imagine if it was that easy? Can you imagine if your loads on their own could make people just grow like mushrooms or imagine. I mean when we know that you have to interact with a woman and make eggs, you know, crack eggs and make babies that way. But imagine if that wasn't the case, imagine if every time you came it made people measure, people came out of your Dick and there's just people everywhere, everywhere getting stepped on that little ones, never get to be adults. We take it for granted that the process is a and female

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       and that that's the only way to create life. I mean, life is crazy enough as it is to think they would, could have been in some bizarre Gonzo parallel universe that it's possible to just create life with your Dick and every time you come, boom, people, a person can be a very overpopulated university. Imagine people screaming at you because you're beating off you fuckhead. What are y'all doing? Piling on top of people everywhere and then you kept someone beating off. Will you fucking stop it? They just make it. People bought. That's what people would do. We wouldn't make so many people. If that was the case, there'd be so many people that the world would cave in. There would be no more written work. You would have. People would just eat the people in front of them. You run out of reach. So yeah, we'd be just eating each other, meeting the people in front of him jerking off and making more.

Speaker 1:          00:06:46       I mean, at what point can overpopulation exist? I mean, if there's no structure, right? If you took all the people in New York City with no structures, no buildings, just piled them on top of each other. You know how many. How much room is there? How much room is there? At what point in time could you a fucking imagine? How many people would it take to cover the planet and just a complete map of people. It's just every time someone came, a person was born. How long was it? Just looked like an octopus. Oh my God. Warming freaks. No one would stop. We wouldn't stop. We would nonstop jerking off. We would. We'd have entire continents covered and you'd come up with a good reason why you're jerking off. You'd rationalize like, wow, what the fuck? I go, dude, a new. The government would get involved though and make you so you can't come.

Speaker 1:          00:07:41       Like they would start neutering. You would be the government. They'd be swarms of people. It'd be unmanageable. There'd be no government. No, no buildings. The blog, we would have never even built buildings. If it was possible, we would have ever figured out anything. If that was how you could come and make a person. It'd be like grass. It'd be like grass at. Yeah. We'd be everywhere. Kudzu. Yeah. Ridiculous. Anyway, go to [inaudible] dot net. Click on the link for the flashlight, the codename Rogan, and you get 15 percent off the ruin sex toy for men, but best commercial ever. Those are the best one we ever did. People complain about those. I'm like, come on, we're free balling. We're just having fun. Let us just do this little business thing. We're also brought to you by. Wait, wait, wait, and if you don't want to buy a flashlight, don't buy it.

Speaker 1:          00:08:26       Just make your own eye. How can you do that? Easily? Melons, melons, fruits, but did not going to be as good as the flush if you're looking to master, but it's a fucking solid tool. There's probably some shit you can do with Jello and gumby and will be as good as the flashlight. They got it. They got it down. Whatever that polymer is, they used to make the vagina. It's fucking outstanding. They spent a long time. Jumps up. Yeah, they did. They have a great product. There's how many people are embarrassed about the fact that like to masturbate. How many uncomfortable flashlights that guy fuck before he

Speaker 5:          00:08:56       came upon this. Could you imagine that? Poor Weirdo. This one's made out of rock, eh? He didn't touch them with fingers first. You don't want to just shove your Dick Right into this new retro model. You don't let it do that if you don't want to just use the, they must have tested them out to animals. They use the animal or solving. Ultimately the dude had to fuck like a lot of different

Speaker 6:          00:09:30       substances in order to create that perfect vagina. I mean, how do you describe that? If you're trying to make it, you know, and you bring it to a factory. This is what I'm looking for. Something like, fuck,

Speaker 5:          00:09:40       I'd like to see that moment when he found it. He said, yeah, I came like five times that last line.

Speaker 6:          00:09:46       Uh, well, yeah, what a weird, a weird thing to invent. But he did an awesome job. However, the process was we're making light of it.

Speaker 5:          00:09:56       He needs to write about the pilot came about. That's an interesting thing now. No. Well I think uh,

Speaker 6:          00:10:02       do to invented it. His, um, his uh, his wife was pregnant when he invented it and he couldn't have sex. So they figured out. He gives resourceful fella.

Speaker 5:          00:10:13       See that? Yeah. That's what you need, man. If you want to invent something good, you've got to be pushed. You got to be pushed, pushed in a corner. Yeah, and then you go for the box stuck. You're writing a box. Worse description. Description started with a guy. His wife had a deformed pussy was brought to you by [inaudible] Dot Com,

Speaker 6:          00:10:38       o n n I t bakers of Alpha brain, the cognitive enhancing supplement. A shroom tech immune. So you use the shroom tech immune

Speaker 5:          00:10:47       like I'm a fucking shell because I'm agreeing to everything here, but I've used these things. These shroom tech. Yeah. When I'm starting to get sick, I eat it and I get better at this stuff. Real. I'm sorry. This stuff really works.

Speaker 6:          00:10:58       It sure is great for just to keep your immune system strong. Apparently the way it works is there's something in it that makes your body think that it's like a disease, like, yeah, whatever. If there's an intruder, so your immune system fires up for a fight that never takes place. It's pretty fucking sporty thing if it works like that. Um, there's also an Alpha brain, excuse me, shroom tech sport, which is the quadriceps mushroom, a sports endurance supplement. And this is only for people who are really into working out. If you're not in Oregon out, don't fuck with it. Brian doesn't.

Speaker 5:          00:11:32       Nah, I don't need it. But if you're in Fitbit, my fitbit let's say, is that like last three days? It is for people that don't know what you're talking about. It's his little thing you snap on you and it counts your steps. And it also like, I like every time you do go up and downstairs it measures out what that would be in distance. It just pretty much tracks everything you do physically and then at night you it and it tells you how long you sleep, how many times do you wake up in the middle of the night and in it. Then it graphs it on this nice page on their website and then you start having like a facebook page of what your fitbit is. It's really weird. It's like, it's like twitter weird. Like we have these stats and then like, like right now my only friends, Bert Kreischer and, and you know, I look at his and he's like, like kicks ass.

Speaker 5:          00:12:12       And then my shit's like, you know, barely registering on the graph and my battery light's like seven times longer than birch. That's like a new way to stalk people. I mean, you could be their exercise buddy. Yeah. Get a, a constant readout. I bet the readouts. Being sensitive government also. That's going to be the thing, man. You're going to have to put your information out there so people know where your heart rate is at every moment. I have this thing that tweets here. Wait, they have a scale that tweets your way so that it's not supposed to keep you motivated to lose weight. Well eventually it's going to be more than that. If you have something on tweets it every time you get on it so you can't even stop it. So yeah, that's it. So you get onto this really brutal on. You're gaining weight and you start.

Speaker 5:          00:12:59       It was brutal. But we are saying about the invention of the flashlight. If you weren't real change to happen, change comes from fucking suffering. Change comes from being in a place that you don't want to be. I mean, you could do it other ways, but generally it comes from getting backed into a corner. Yeah, you gotta you gotta straighten up. You get your shit together. You got to fight back. That's why people get enthusiastic about things and start companies and get a big burst of enthusiasm. I could never murder somebody while wearing a fitbit. I just realized why because they will know. They will be able to see graph because it shows you when you're extremely working out and it has like red grabs and stuffed up thinking about murdering people. Or I could put it on somebody that, that, you know, isn't like sleeping like I could put on my mom and then go out and in the middle of the night and murder people that come back and take off.

Speaker 5:          00:13:46       My Mom's not going to accept your fit bit and that they could use that as evidence. I would imagine. Well, there could also use it as evidence that your resting heart rate went from 70 to 82 or whatever. Open person. So I did a review on [inaudible] dot TV fitbit. You're really into it. Uh, uh, and it's kind of, I can see what it's like when I started using twitter for the first time. There's something there. There's some kind of weird. This is the next step, right? This is the next piece of connectivity. This is turning your body into an x box when it comes to like fitness, you know, it's fit. That's fucking bad ass man.

Speaker 5:          00:14:22       Wow. That's kind of interesting. Yeah. And of course you're going to be like that. Have the most friends of fitbit rural because you're going to be working out so extreme and everyone that would be like, you're, you're not like instead of Dane Cook having 5 million friends on twitter that you would have the most extreme. You have the most like red graph, like you worked out the hardest or a lot of dudes beating off to my account. Could be that too. And the person that sleeps, that's the person that sleeps the best. Would it be like some kind of weird wizard of

Speaker 6:          00:14:52       Fitbit road? We should have talked about this on the let's just get this commercial over with on a day you just go to [inaudible] dot com. I'm tired of talking about this stuff. Here's how I feel about it. It's we can't make this any nicer. And by the way, we had to change a rule because some people are cons. We used to say that if you buy something and you don't like it, you could send it back and you don't even have to send it back. We'll give you 100 percent money back guarantee. But people were buying like 10 bottles and then they would. They would take like three of them will go, yeah, I'm not really into this. And so then they would sell the rest on Ebay so they would get their refund and then they would sell on Ebay. Unbelievable people such twats it will find a hole that was a good idea, but it wasn't a good idea to take advantage of our hospitality.

Speaker 6:          00:15:35       So now it's only the first 30 pills and you should be able to figure out within 30 pills. I mean, you know, it's a lot of people say like, if you could you, can you really. How much can you tell the difference between when you're eating multivitamins and when you're not? Any multivitamins? I can tell. I can tell there's this subtle thing. It's a, but I'm really in tune with my shit. I eat healthy. I work out a lot. I take supplements. I know like what gets me and what doesn't. But there's some people, man that don't know you can, you can give them things and they're not sure. Is this my multivitamin? Wharton was in watching, you know, they're not, they don't feel they're, but they're not in tune with their body so much. You know, and I mean if you're not really athletic, if you don't push your body to extremes and you don't eat healthy and clean, I think a lot of people, they. There's a missing amount of communication. There's not an in intimacy with your body.

Speaker 3:          00:16:23       Well, they, what? I think when you're feeling bad, you kind of get good at numbing it out or ignoring it. So they're, they've kind of liked. They've shut down their ability to like feel if you really honestly appraise their health because like if you're out of shape and you're fucking smoking all the time and you're drinking all the time, I speak from experience. If you get into like a Jag of living like that, after a certain amount of time, you just start tuning out the weird pains in your body. You just started ignoring it because you don't want to. You don't because it's just the truth and the truth is you can't constantly fucking eat like shit and smoke and drink and that ended up with you at the other end of that feeling great.

Speaker 6:          00:17:03       So important to take a variety of different things that are good for your health. In my opinion, you should really eat a lot of healthy vegetables. That's like one of the most important things. One of the strongest things I've ever done is increase the amount of like green leafy vegetables in my diet and drink kale shakes and shit like that. Take multivitamins please. It's not hard. It's fucking easy and it'll make you healthier. It just, it will make you feel better. Eat good food, you know, and and look into nootropics if you're not into any of the shit that we have at [inaudible] dot com. There's plenty of other people that have cool shit available, so we try to make it as easy and as clean as possible. I'm way more concerned than I say this every fucking time, but it's because it's true.

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       I'm way more concerned with not ripping people off than I am with making money. So that's the end of that fucking horseshit button. Let's start the show. Duncan trussell.

Speaker 6:          00:18:17       I cut way back on my coffee consumption. I have found that coffee and the show go well together. Oh yeah. I think they're important in order to just keep spitting information out. This is this. What are you doing with that Echo, man? You're killing me.

Speaker 1:          00:18:32       Won't go waiting for it. It won't go away. Period. To be crazy, man. That's how it feels like when you're tripping, like you smoke too much weed and you start having a panic attack that started going on. It's almost there. It's almost kind of his own. Such a delay. It's, it's just a weird, stupid, special effect that I do. Do you always do the same one? No, it doesn't. Usually. I usually mix it up. Does this make you feel better when you do these things? Yeah, it's just a cool intro. You know? Might as well start off with a weird, creepy noise. Doug and trust is here. How we can. We don't have to get any weird or creepy or not creepy in a bad way, brother. Creeping the best possible way. You know, I love you. We all love you. I love you guys were doing the Chicago Theater, uh, this Friday night.

Speaker 1:          00:19:22       Fucking super fired up in me and Joey Coco motherfucking Diaz in the flesh if you, if you have never had a chance to see Joey Diaz live going to shit yourself. That guy, dude, he had his moments. He had some moments on stage where it's just ridiculous shit that he says. It just makes you repeat what he said over and over and over again. He's one of those dudes when he, when Joey like really rocks it on stage, he'll say one of the something so fucking completely preposterous and so out of control that you'll just be repeating it. You'd be like, he's fucking. You'll just repeat what he said. Like over and over. He had the reregistration your head almost like did I really just had his fucking that transvestite joke.

Speaker 1:          00:20:10       One of the greatest jokes anybody's ever told onstage. He goes, I like transvestites. They Cook, they clean. They couldn't beat on him. Every once in awhile the cops come who they're gonna, believe me or some dude with a wig and a black guy. There's no support groups for these people. The cops come, who is it going to believe me? Dude, a wig and a black. That's just, that's just poetry, man. To me, that's poetry. You know, like the, the amount of words used, the structure of it, the great jazz. A fucking animal. Chili ideas is an animal. It's so

Speaker 4:          00:20:48       funny, man. We had them on the podcast the other day. Dude, just talk. He can talk about anything. Toothpicks. I know a fucking. Due to my two picks on a fucking crazy story about a big factor in this chick was sucking everybody's Dick. You know what I'm saying? So Papa had to get his exist. Toothpick factory story will become some fucking epic. He's fucking. That's ever lived. He's the greatest team of. Bring this up. I fucking love that guy. That's one of the most awesome things about living here. Is that all you guys are here. That's one of the things that kind of keeps me in this area right now because all you guys are here, it's like we have a lot of cool friends. We have a very unusual situation. We need to all move at the same exact thing. We need to get together like an occupy Wall Street thing and be like, all right, we're all moving. At the same time. We got to be prepared for civil unrest because the government is okay. So we've got to start thinking if the shit went down, we need a goddamn ranch somewhere. Yep. You know, a ranch somewhere with like a bunch of houses, a castle, and Joe all live in this nice little farming ranch community until the dust settles. Yeah, you can do that, man.

Speaker 7:          00:22:05       It's good to have a place like that to go to. Man. I've got to a place like that to go to, but yeah, I do. But I did it in North Carolina. It's in Jacksonville, North Carolina. It's in Georgia. I will not reveal the precise location near the Georgia guidestones. Oh, I wish it was. Now it's not, it's not near the Georgia guidestones. I don't know where those are actually, but I'm sure those are either. Let's find out how you going to do that, but go ahead. Brought Dr. but you got it. I think it's a smart thing to have. I mean, in any fucking house you want to have, you want to way if you're in a hotel or wherever, it's good to know where to go if there's going to be a fire. It's the same thing with civilization. It's not. I mean, it doesn't make you crazy. It just makes you a normal thinking person.

Speaker 6:          00:22:46       Elbert County, uh, Elbert county's where in Galveston County, the Georgia guidestones, it'll large granite monument in Elbert County, Georgia. Yeah. A message that contains 10 guides is inscribed on the structure in eight modern languages. And a shorter message is inscribed at the top of the structure in, for ancient language scripts. Babylonian, classical Greek sand script in Egypt, in hieroglyphs. You should have some pretty intense shit, man. Yeah, I mean this is someone saying, you know, look, if humanity completely falls apart, here's a message, get to this stuff. This is crucial information.

Speaker 7:          00:23:28       Somebody should have told them that there's not a lot of people in southern Georgia that speak classical

Speaker 6:          00:23:32       Greek. This is what it says on. It's really very interesting because it's very wise words. Listen to this. Maintain humanity under $500, million in perpetual balance with nature, 500 million on the whole planet. Good idea. Guide reproduction wisely. Improving fitness and diversity. Eugenics. That sounds a little eugenics, but rational as well, right? I mean, you know, utopian, of course Utopian but rash, right? Okay. Unite humanity with a living new language. We all had one language that would make everything a lot fucking easier. Right? Rule, passion, faith, tradition, and all things with tempered reason. Sound words, write some words. Protect people and nations with fair laws and just courts. Okay. Let all nations rule internally resolving external disputes in a world court. I don't hear any new world order shit yet. Right? Avoid petty laws and useless officials a bit. Subjective.

Speaker 3:          00:24:39       Well, I mean a lot of this stuff is subject. This is pretty subjective though, right? Hey laws and useless officials saying, resolve your problems in a world court. What? How do you do that?

Speaker 6:          00:24:48       That seems like a weird one. The petty laws and useless officials. It seems silly. That seems like it should be. You know, maybe. Well, price is a good one. Bounce personal rights with social duties. Agreed. That's smart, right? Strong communities. Shit. Yeah. Prize truth. Beauty. Love seeking harmony with the infinite. Okay. Now you're getting a little crystally. Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:25:12       It sounds almost like Dr. Bronner's soap. It's like that shit on Dr. Bronner's soap.

Speaker 6:          00:25:16       Okay, here we hear here. Now I don't like it at all. Listen, be not a cancer on the earth, leave room for nature, leave room for nature. Now I don't like it because that's a stupid thing to say. First of all, be not a cancer on the earth. What do you Shakespeare Bitch, you, they don't have cancer. Don't be cancer. Cancer, silly. I guess if you're not going to use contractions, maybe you think contractions with real people.

Speaker 3:          00:25:40       I think. Here's the thing that I think is really funny about these stones and about like, I just watched cave of forgotten dreams, which is pretty awesome. Um, which is like they went, didn't get into it, man. I, I shut it off halfway and I got bored. I thought I got into it because I was just thinking about how crazy it was. The rhinos were in France at one point and kind of like who the fuck are these people? It was a little dry, but if you carve something in stone and you put it deep enough in this stone and are big enough stone, it's guaranteed that if people are still around in like hundreds of thousands of years, they're going to think that that really meant something, you know, they're going to think it was very important just because you carved it in stone, so it could be anything. You could put anything on a cave wall and people will come in and look at and be like, wow, look at this. They're either they worshiped a penis with a with a happy face on it and it's just a guy like painted something on Georgia guidestones. It's just some guy went and carved some shit and stone makes

Speaker 6:          00:26:41       sense. I mean I just be not a cancer on

Speaker 4:          00:26:44       the earth. Leave Room for nature. Leave Room for nature. That means that is. I mean I'm, we're goofing on it, but that is like a good thought.

Speaker 3:          00:26:51       I think they're great for all of it. Seems like. Okay. It's just. I don't think that there's anything.

Speaker 4:          00:26:55       Well, it's like twitter messages. You can't get too profound when you're carving in stone. Yeah. You're carving on a fucking, a limited amount of space. Uh, yeah. What, what would you tell people if you, if you had Georgia guidestones of your own, if you could leave behind some monument to future monkey people that figure this out again? Yeah. You know what? So many, so many quoted. It was a fascinating quote. That civilization, if you, if you look at it as made by the brightest minds, is disappointing. It's disappointing where we are, but if you look at it as something that's been thrown together by monkeys, it's amazing. Amazing.

Speaker 3:          00:27:32       We're doing so good right now. If you think about how good we're doing, we're doing great,

Speaker 4:          00:27:36       but isn't that an interesting thing that you know, that people know that human beings are capable of so much better, so much better behavior, so much more of a, of a safe, sane, rational, loving world. We're capable that we're all capable of that as an, as individuals will cave. We're all capable of being loving and nice and friendly, and if we're all capable of it. Then in groups we spread out and then somehow or another it gets lost along the way. So where does it get lost on the way when they're fighting over resources, when they're fighting over, you know, crazy ideas. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:28:13       The ideas. Mostly it's the problem is the ideas. It's the resources thing. If you have resources you can work out. If you don't have crazy ideas, research resources, you can work out. It's the fucking crazy ideas. I just saw that guy, the physicist. Well, I can never pronounce his name. Moceanu. What's this? He's a genius in Chicago. Yes. He, uh, he was talking about the different types of civilization type zero civilization type one civilization type two civilization. I think someone just put it on my facebook wall, but basically the concept behind it is that right now we're moving from a type zero civilization to a type one civilization, which is we're going into a place where we're going to recognize that we're all, you know, uh, or planetary. You know what I mean? We're a planetary civilization instead of broken up and all these weird divergent pieces where they all speak different languages and we have these different beliefs.

Speaker 3:          00:29:04       We're moving into something where we're all connected via the internet, but he said this is the most dangerous time possible because we're moving from type zero type one and the type zero people, the ones with the crazy ideas, they have nuclear weapons and so we're in a place where if we don't work this shit out there can be, we can destroy ourselves, but if we can get past these crazy ideas that differentiate us, that split us up the shit where people say like, you know, those marines just pissed on, on, uh, on the Taliban that they shot. And everybody got upset about that. Everybody got upset about. They got upset that they were pissing on him. They didn't get upset that they killed. They were like, how could you urinate on bodies? It's like, you just blew fucking holes in the chest. These men, that's horrifying. That's awful.

Speaker 3:          00:29:55       That's the worst still at a place right now where it's worse to piss on a dead body. Then to make a dead body, now when we get to a place where making a dead body has the same cultural resonance is pissing on one where it makes national news because one person had the fucking insane idea of like shooting someone instead of working it out through language or talking it out. That's when we're going to be in or entering a new age and new if we can make it there. A new evolutionary period where we recognize that a solution to a problem is never is never blasting people to smithereens. And if it is, it's so fucking rare that like it's the most rare thing. It's only in the most rare situations, you know? So I think that I think we're on the verge of getting to this place and I think the Internet is helping.

Speaker 3:          00:30:40       I think every time you look at what happened with Sopa and Pipa and you see the power of this organizing force and logic seems to rule in the Internet. It's just logical people. The logical majority seems to be making things happen. So if that happened on a planetary scale where instead of these fucking insane guys like the president of Syria, good at freak. If you seen that fucking guy, he's insane. He's insane. He's insane. Dictator, you know, it's like these people that wasn't a move. Mubarak and what's his name in Egypt? What was his name? Mubarak was like, guys, you think it's okay to be president for 40 years straight? You know what I mean? These fucking assholes. Once we start getting them out of the picture, you know, and then move on to the fucking the clerics and the Prius two or like teaching people that are the only way to communicate with the university. Connect with God. Once we get rid of those motherfuckers. This is pretty awesome planet man. The resources thing. We can work it out. We can work out the resources. I think we could. Smart. I couldn't maybe, but someone

Speaker 4:          00:31:40       love it. Awesome. Optimistic view of the world. If we could just all communicate in the same native language so we could tell each other this. Yeah. That's a big part of the problem. Be Part of the problem is if you were, if there was some sort of a civil unrest or some sort of a problem with another part of the country that was European, we would get all the information back immediately. What's going on? Exactly what's going on. Can you imagine like the United States was in Ireland for some reason. Oh my God. Wow. It would be ridiculous. You know,

Speaker 3:          00:32:06       and also this, this level, this language, this new language that I, that it wouldn't just be us talking the same language. It's a neurologically, it's an, it's a technological neurological interface that allows us to directly communicate emotion to each other because it's like imagine how many stupid arguments you've gotten in like with your girlfriend or with your friends that you. It's, it just is about language. We're underneath it. You're just feeling the exact. You're just like, I really want things to be okay and you're right. You know what I mean? So if you could just feel how that felt were, because I mean, think about it. We're forced to articulate our universe through the same fucking Oregon that we use to chew hamburgers. That's our way of describing the entire, it's the tip of our feeding tubes is how we're forced to describe the infinite.

Speaker 3:          00:32:53       We're fucking limited. It's like in my left foot when the guy could only paint with his foot. Remember that we have infinity out here and all we have to access to, to describe this infinity and our perception of it in the way it feels to be a part of it is a language that we didn't come up with ourselves. The language has been passed down in his, uh, you know, it was a trade language. So a lot of the words that we have, there might not be words that exist right now to describe certain facets of reality and sometimes that'll make them invisible. But if you could undercut language and just have a emotional fucking connection where you could feel another person's emotions. I mean, imagine being the president of Syria and you come in, you the guide is like killing protesters, you know, jailing people and torturing them.

Speaker 3:          00:33:38       You take that guy and just for one second, he gets a feeling of what it's like to be out in the street or to be in a country where you've had a president forever and you're being completely repressed. If he could feel that feeling, you know what I mean? It would be hard for him to continue on. It will be hard for them to live and delusion and to think that, oh, I see. It's easy to be a tyrant. I deserve this, or these people are less than me. Slavery never would've been able to happen. Slavery was based on this ridiculous idea that somehow black people deserve to be enslaved. You know? It's the same thing with eating meat. We believe that in general people one one way, not everyone. Some mediators are like, yeah, I, I'll, I'll eat. I eat meat and I know that these animals have feelings and generally die of brutal life, but I think I deserve to eat meat and I think that's natural.

Speaker 3:          00:34:21       That's the best rationale for eating meat. That's it. You acknowledge the suffering and pain you're causing and you do it and you do it because you think you deserve it, but some people they think fucking animals are like clockwork things. You know what I mean? Like little mechanistic, like a wristwatch, and they don't feel the same things that we feel and we'll never know that until we create a neurological interface with animals in the moment you realized, oh fuck man, these cows, they feel love. They feel love for each other and fear and they fucking more than their kids. Then when you sit down and eat a hamburger, it's going to be a much more intense experience. It's maybe it'll make it taste better. I don't know, but it's going to be this cow new love. Do A. is that all true what you said about the.

Speaker 3:          00:35:11       Well, no, I don't think we. I don't think we can know that, but I think that there are like the, my, like when I was in India, they like the cows kind of wander the streets and they don't. They're not like, you know, they're not abused in the same way that they are here. I'm sure there are some, but the ones they're like, they're like really sweet dogs. They'll come up to you and rub their muzzle against you and you can scratch behind their ears and they're just very sweet. I mean, I'm not saying cows are fucking dolphin of cows. Eventually evolve it. Just get

Speaker 4:          00:35:37       a little bit smarter and learn how to speak English and then like start coming into people's houses and see all the leather shit. What the fuck you, you abandon you imagine? I mean we just assumed the cows are never going to evolve because of where they are right now is where they are. You know, we assume they're just gonna fucking eat the grass and just be all stupid and not get anything done. Just run around and make milk. They started allowing them on buses. Yeah. What if, what if, what if something happens would have. Maybe it's radiation. Maybe it's like some fucking third world country where we would make in Nike's and they did something to the water supply and it makes cow super smart. Funny Dude. Can you imagine that? The Lord Jesus Christ, you have leather. Everything you fuckheads you think you think it's cool to have leather? Everything we have, like the skin of a murdered animal is like standard on cars. That's our favorite shit. We want to sit down and flesh peeled flesh from an murdered animal is the preferred seating choice. Yeah. That's how I like my seat covered. I'd like affirm nice back of have murdered animal hide with minimal padding.

Speaker 3:          00:36:49       Yeah. Isn't it odd though that like even if like I, you know, for if I died, I mean maybe I'm wrong about this, but if I put my will, I want my, I want my flesh cured and made into wallets for my friends. I don't think I could legally do that. I don't think you can do that. You know? I don't think you could do that either. People that so superstitious and odd.

Speaker 4:          00:37:13       Well it is, but you don't want to really open up that market. You don't want to give any flashmarket wallet market, man. You don't even want to open that door. Well, I do. You don't want have any of those out there. You know why? Because there's some one dude and he just, he's going to get through this miserable life in one piece, one way or another until one day he's at the flea market and he finds a human flesh wallet and that's it. He's got to make human flesh everything. Boom. Murder spree making human flesh underwear. Yeah. Not Good. Yeah. You don't want to encourage that kind of shit. You can't have that out there. You can't have human flesh wallets out there. People just to unpredictably fucked up. I won't do it. I will. I'll cancel my kickstarter account. That's going to be a real problem and it's not just communicating. It's figuring out how to develop people or redevelop them after they'd been fucked up as children, that there's going to be something they figured some sort of a reset.

Speaker 3:          00:38:06       Well, again, if you can get an emotional read on a person like how they're experiencing reality, then you can communicate with them much better. I mean some, some, some, some people are fucked. Communicate

Speaker 4:          00:38:20       smart as a species. That's one of the big things that we would do. We would set up places where people who had fucked her lives up can go and not be a criminal and get some food and have so many help them figure things out like, listen, what do we know we can keep you from going to jail for the rest of your life? Let's let's work this out. Let's fucking figure you out a fucking career path here. Help this dude. Somebody helped. These people are obviously everybody's pulling yourself up by your own bootstraps, which I believe in for for most things. For most things. That would be the advice, but occasionally there's some people that are a part of society. They're just, they're handed the shittiest fucking hand of cards ever in life and you know, and then they find themselves in and out of the judicial system as a young kid and they find themselves in jail. I mean, it's like, man, you don't think that that dude somehow or another, she didn't get a fair shake ever in his whole life. You know, and everybody just wants to just lock them up and put them in. That's not the solution either. The solution is how you fix them.

Speaker 3:          00:39:26       It's so weird, man. It's like the vagina is an elevator door that opens up into this dimension. And like sometimes that elevator puts you out on a bad fucking place.

Speaker 8:          00:39:39       That is one of the most brilliant things you've ever said. That elevator smells. You gotta. Remember that? Somebody tweet that to doug. I remember that. That's a bit, dude. I've been saying

Speaker 3:          00:39:48       some version of that but I'm not like that. But. So the idea is you get smashed out into the, in some of these people get fucked up. They get blasted out into a bad apartment surrounded by crackheads. Deal. It's terrifying. Yeah man. And, and, and this fucking. What does this lead to? This leads to what you're talking about. These people who, who have, I mean, imagine spending the first 12 years of your life before you went into a foster home with the most neurons when you're, uh, when you're a baby, as more neurons in their brain than at any other time in their life. So you're like, as a wax seal, a baby's brain is like a wax seal and the fucking family is like the ring that you know, they pushed into like, you know, and like in the fucking like medieval times. It's like we get imprinted and we can't resist it by the vibrational frequencies that were around when we're, when we're blasted into this dimension and, and you need help to get those things transformed.

Speaker 3:          00:40:47       Like you can't just do it on your own. The record's been pressed, man. You need help to fucking overcome the weird patterns that come from living next to the lunatics that were your parents. Not everyone had crazy parents, but many people had fucked up parents. They were giving like think about how young. I mean, I think our younger parents were when they had you think about that, where they are in their twenties. Joe, my, when my mother was 21 when she had me. When was the last time you talked to a 21 year old last night for am.

Speaker 8:          00:41:24       That's all I needed to know. Brian lives in that world. He lives in the world of. He's the only 37 year old man I know that uses the word like

Speaker 7:          00:41:34       I've, I'm guilty. I'm like, this guy's like, and I'm like, get out here. And I do that. I liked it. I do the likes, man. I, I listened to these youtube videos sometimes people make in a year, might lag, lag lag. It makes me want to. So my lip.

Speaker 6:          00:41:51       Well that's a cool thing about podcasts is you get to find out how annoying your personality really is. The annoying aspects of it gets highlighted.

Speaker 7:          00:41:59       Yeah. I just get back in your face. It's good to see. It really is. There's A. I've read this, there's an interesting essay that this guy got the weirdest name. His name's Suzanne and he's, uh, he's like, I don't know the exact word for what he is, but he's like an anarchist primitive as he thinks. Everything started going bad when we started using symbols to represent reality instead of just being in reality when the moment you start using symbols to represent reality, you're kind of boxing reality in and you're separating yourself. You're creating the separation from you and the universe. And so he was talking about the growing use of the term, like how people use the word, like instead of just saying what it is, so you know, it's like you're walking outside and you're like, come up to this thing and you're like. And he says, what that is is this subconscious problem where people are not directly experiencing reality. So everything's like something else. Things aren't being, things are being like something else. It's very curious that it's pretty good if you look up Suzanne, that's, it's, it's a little fucking dense, but it's a pretty good essay. Have you ever hung out with guys a hate symbols that hate symbols and drums?

Speaker 6:          00:43:15       No. To either one of those instruments? Well, you know, it's weird. You know, I'm, one of the things that I always thought it was fascinating about ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs is that they, they had a completely different way of writing things. So they must've had a completely different way of talking dip, completely different way of phrasing things. And uh, and you, you, you, you, when you look at like how you could be a human being, obviously an intelligent human being, advanced sophisticated culture, capable of producing amazing works of art, but that language is like totally alien to us. Like we look at it and like what is this crazy chicken scratch and pictures of birds and shit and these fucking people, this is what they use to describe the world. But somehow or another to them it worked. Like they, they, they, they thought of things like in a different way. Their, their language, their written language consisted of like symbols. Yeah. You know, not, not like ours but like, you know, but like images, really fascinating shit.

Speaker 7:          00:44:20       Yeah, it is. Languages is one of the most fascinating things to think about when you're tripping. Like it's fun to contemplate where each word is coming from, like the transformation

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       of the thought into the word and how instantaneous that happened. So when you start contemplating where at where's this, where's this language coming from? I don't even think about this. It just, it just happened.

Speaker 6:          00:44:43       And for the longest time, for the longest time, people have always been aware that one of the big things that keeps people from really directly communicating with everybody is the language barrier. Yes. I mean that's why the myth of the Tower of Babel existed, that, that, that was like a plan to give us all different languages so we can never fucking figure out how to communicate with each other. Which is really fascinating because it really would make sense. Like if someone had that kind of power, if we lose like a warlock who could just go and we'll give everyone a different language. God, that would be a good move. If you really could do that. I mean if it was that easy to be the architect of reality, that would be a good move. You don't want them to rally up. We'll have them all live in these little spots and give him the fucking languages and shit. No one understands what you're

Speaker 3:          00:45:30       say. If I went over to God's house, like if there's a lot of God's living in the same neighborhood and they all have these little aquarium earth they're fucking with, none of them were shy. Went over to a fucking. Got The God's House that did that. Feel like you're a dick man. Let them speak the same language and have fun. Why are you? Why do you consistently fuck with these people? You got to give them a break. I, you know what I call animal control on God. Like look at it. Look like if you believe the concept of God and really think about like the fundamentalist Christian concept of God, if this, if any, if someone was doing that to animals, what God is apparently doing to us according to the fundamentalist Christians, he would go to jail for a long time. Anonymous would fucking attacking God's a sadist. He's like taking gay people, burning them in hell forever. He's like giving cancer to people because they deserve it. He makes people go blind. He turned a whole city in the Bible. That salt or something. Yeah, he did a lot of creepy shit. He's a creep. There's no other way around it. There's no other way around it. There's better ways to deal with it.

Speaker 6:          00:46:33       People you don't understand. Dunkin, the Lord has a plan in all the Ode to you in your mind. You believe you have it all figured out and then you're smarter than the Lower Nicei. That's not possible.

Speaker 3:          00:46:48       You're a talker, you're a mocker. I can remember this.

Speaker 6:          00:46:51       You're thinking too much. They get mad at you. Well, can I have questions? That's not what. That's not what you shouldn't use your mind for that. You got to let God be scripture sales, right? Scripture say he who walk with me walk with the Lord will say shit like that. And he goes, what does that even mean? What the fuck does that mean? Well, I mean, what it means. That means that's the dude with the mushrooms.

Speaker 3:          00:47:18       Well, yeah, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's. So that's the sad thing is these, there's a great book called, it's by Abraham maslow and it's called religious values and peak and it talks about a theoretical, the theory, the theory of how a religion happens and the progression of information as it goes from being someone who's really happy to it being a priest class that's controlling people. And so his idea is certain people throughout time have had peak experiences where they break through that particular ego barrier created by the Zeitgeists of their time. They have a direct communication with some kind of like super ideas, superintelligence, whatever you want to call it. They get really happy, happy in a way. Not just like someone who's having a good day, but in a way where if you ran into them, you would recognize it. They'd figured something out. So that person gets a group of people around him who are kind of magnetized by the energy and by what they're saying and they're talking about are a real way that you can live and actually be happy in the world.

Speaker 3:          00:48:24       And those people from being around someone who's like, you know, like in sports they used to say you can own a five minute mile, you could only run a mile and this amount of time. And everyone thought that everyone was doing that. And then right when someone broke it, all of a sudden everyone started breaking. It's like, Oh yeah, I could do that. So in the same way these certain people will overcome a specific, you know, a phantom of their time, which is causing them to be miserable. Those people get people around them will also get this certain level of happiness. The person who came up with the original idea dies. Now he's just got the disciples and the disciples that people around them and they transmit this idea to the people are on him. But now it's a little diluted in some of the people we were doing and aren't quite, aren't really quite happy.

Speaker 3:          00:49:09       They're not doing it right. So you pass that down, keeps getting water, getting watered and watered and watered. And then the next thing you know, you just, you, you have like some fucking, like old horny man with his pants down, just nailing a toddler and a confession booth and, and, and that, that's the end result. Starts off with this super happy guy, ends up with a fucking pedophile dress like a god clown with his cock and a kid's ass. That's how, that's how mutated things get. Which is why it's very funny that people feel so desperate to cling onto this old thing instead of thinking, wait, there might be a new thing that we can come up with based on all the information we have right now. The end

Speaker 4:          00:49:53       of the day, it's all shit that was written down by people at the end of the day. Yeah. And why would we ever think that the people who lived thousands of years ago had it? Right. Okay. Why? Why would you want to believe that? There might be information there that we could use and could help us. But the most important thing is to know what we know now. Yes. No. What do we know now? And let's figure this fucking thing out together. That's right. Following some. Any crazy shit. Anything. I don't care what it is. Judaism, Christianity, Muslim. What do you want to be? What do you want to be? I want to be a car. Krishna. It's awesome. It's all the same. It's all something that someone put put together. What? The message behind it. Who? Who knows if it's right. Who knows if it's wrong. Who knows if there really is a, an actual man, the fucking clouds.

Speaker 4:          00:50:43       And in the biblical sense, who the fuck knows? I mean, I, I. It doesn't seem likely to me based on what I've experienced in my life, but if it is going to be pissed, but even if it is, I mean the university is fucking so bizarre. The. Yeah. Just the idea of the infinite space is so bizarre that a guy in the clouds with a horrible. Why is that so weird? I mean, yeah, why not? Fucking why not? Why not? Why not? There'd be one guy that's running the whole fucking. What the fuck you, you know, it sounds crazy that there could be a heaven, a pearly gates and shit, and you get up there and there's dudes wearing white and everybody's floating. But imagine if it was true. Imagine if you got up, you, I wouldn't. That is not to me nearly as shocking. Heaven is not nearly as shocking as the universe itself.

Speaker 3:          00:51:29       Well, I, I think that it's what we're talking about here is that the ability to describe reality and to, and to uh, understand reality. It keeps increasing as we evolve as a species. So a really smart people and you know, in every single time there's been very smart people at every single time, really smart people in different ways, but their ability to describe reality was limited to the language available to them and the technology that was around them at the time. I mean, if you look at like, Shit, man, I hope you remember this because there's a book in the Old Testament that is in my mind is clearly a Ufo encounter. I think it's not leviticus, it's as equal. Now you look at that and what is the guy who used to describe this thing? We'll within the Marriott's. Yeah, wheels and chariots and just the shit that's available to him to describe this experience that he had now. Now if someone saw that same thing, they'd be like, yeah, I got sucked up by a Ufo. They gave me a psychedelic. I saw something that's coming which is relevant

Speaker 4:          00:52:30       or period coconut felon that motherfucker's head and sparks were flying and he didn't know what happened. He woke up in a ditch with a bloody head with a have been loosening far.

Speaker 3:          00:52:41       It could have been allison nation and and people just believed it, but I think that, I mean outside of religious hallucinations or visions and people trying to describe it, everyone's limited to the tools that they have around them to observe reality and they can only report on reality based on the tools that they had

Speaker 4:          00:53:00       and the experiences that they have to draw upon. Which is one of the reasons why the whole Ufo thing seemed so preposterous to people. It's so we don't have that experience to draw upon the experience of an alien intelligent life form. It's like looking back at us while we're looking at it, I don't think. I think 90 percent of the people on the planet which is die of a heart attack, like immediately, boom, to fucking explode. Yeah. If aliens came and they were super intelligent with big fucking gray heads and those giant black guys, they can totally read your mind and they were all just like floating and freezing people and erasing memories and shit. Like all these Travis Walton stories. You know that guy that if that's all, if that were to actually happen, I don't think the human race would survive. I think we, we can't serve. We're the alpha. We can't exist in a world where we're under the thumb of some incredibly intelligent, super sophisticated alien life form that thinks in a completely different way than us and can control matter.

Speaker 3:          00:54:00       Well, you know man, I, I always, I have this optimistic idea of actual matter like I'm working writing for the x amount. It's not going to. I don't think it's going to come from the sky and the silver ships. I think the way it goes down is it maybe all of a sudden you kind of. We as a species get to a point where we kind of realized we remember actually what's going on. I think right now we have a little bit of Amnesia. We have lost a, a, a sense of like what truly is happening. I think when you take a really potent psychedelic, sometimes you'll see this universe that already is around you that's already happening around you at all times. You get a sense all of a sudden that you've been there before and then it goes away. But it seems like we're more like getting projected into this reality with awful amnesia. For some, I don't know what it's for. It could be, it could be just a video game. Could be a, uh, a sadistic joke could be a prank. This could be a prank that one super intelligent entities playing on another superintelligent enemy entity. It could be anything.

Speaker 4:          00:55:05       Or it can be a novelty creating machine. Like on Mckenna thought that the universe is a novelty creating and harvesting machine and that we as the most complex organisms possibly in the universe where we're at at the pinnacle of this novelty creation. Yeah, man. That's like, that's. That's the whole reason for it all. It seems chaotic to us and say, look, this is preposterous. We should know better, but it's almost like in our instincts as an organism, we have a direction to go and the direction is not spiritual. It's technological. That's it. People are not looking for some sort of a spiritual release and some sort of a, a, a broader perspective on the universe in an objective view of life. No. They're looking to see if they can punch a hole through the center of space. You know what I mean? It's those real height of progress is not a complete overhauling and understanding of the educational system of the way to develop human minds, the way to stop people from harming each other instead of devoting all of our resources to evolving socially. If it even is possible ever. Instead of doing that

Speaker 3:          00:56:17       well, one, one thing you can do is instead of when you think about the passage of time as we move into the future, if you like, get out of your head, this idea, it's like running down a race track or something like you're running down a track and think of it more in the sense of a revealing is happening. So as we progress into the future, more things begin to emerge into this reality that weren't there before. Like we go from having stone tools to all of a sudden having a, you know, iron tools and then we go from that to all of a sudden you know, where we are now, where we're surrounded by fucking silver, glowing macintosh computers and like microphones that are somehow recording our voice and these things keep getting revealed more and more and more. And any of these items should you take them back 100 years, people would think it was a Ufo.

Speaker 3:          00:57:05       They'd see it and think that fell out of a space ship. So all of a sudden you realize, and maybe Mckenna said this, I think he may have said something like this, but the idea is the spaceship, the alien, the extra terrestrial intelligence. It's growing around us like crystals when you were a kid and you're growing crystals, but it's growing in the form of technology that eventually is going on to become self aware, which is why I heard this awesome thing, which is the first alien contact that we have is going to be a computer that wakes up, that's going to be our first communication with another consciousness. Not something from the great void of space, but something that grew through time. I

Speaker 6:          00:57:43       say, I said that's totally possible, but I don't say not something from space. So as it could be something from space. Yeah, that's possible too. I hope it is. It could be that the first Ufo or the first, you know, uh, the first real intelligence that we encountered this greater than our own is something that we create ourselves at replicates itself through us. Like very quickly. Like that was the idea that once a computer becomes the real issue is going to be that they're going to be able to live. This is a stupid fucking design who built me and then they build something like way better. That's it. Instantly they know exactly how to put it together once they and you know the idea of programming emotions and programming are a million system of, of dealing with babies and puppies and little baby chickie's and shit.

Speaker 6:          00:58:27       They won't have any of that guilt or weird feeling about biological life and they might just say, look at these fucking assholes shitting all over this planet. We can't even use half of the resources on the planet because it's fuck heads have blown up nuclear bombs. Nuclear waste and holes were like cats will like take our nuclear ships and we just throw them in a hole and then we cover over. It was like stupid cats at the top of the heap of technological innovation and science. The best way to get rid of nuclear waste. Besides shooting it at other planets, could you imagine what assholes we would be considered in the universe? If we just shot our nuclear waste up into space like a rocket, you know, we send it out with the voyager to crash lands on someone's fucking moon someday, or what if it starts some future war? They think it's a bomb we send, we shoot nuclear waste. There were just. Apparently it's very devastating to their particular kills,

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       like 80 percent of the people on the planet, the rest they get together on giant bow ships and had to earth so fucking good movies. Somebody make that, make that movie. Would they, could they show shoot nuclear waste in this space? Can they do that? Well, it gets stuck in the problem with that. Is it my. Yeah, I'm sure you could, but it would take. It takes so much energy to get it out of the orbit of the planet that it ends up becoming less efficient to use nuclear energy. You know, they blew up a bomb in the, uh, the atmospheric operation, I believe. I think it was called operation starfish. Prime Corner knows the name of it. Yeah. Let me Google that. So don't starfish prime day involved? No, no, no. For real man, they they decided to shoot a fucking nuclear warhead. The ionosphere wouldn't like fuck up some kind of rotation or something or possibly.

Speaker 1:          01:00:17       Well, you don't want it to fall back. Yeah. Oh, you mean blowing up a fucking in the atmosphere? I think at that time they didn't really know what it was. What did I say? What's prime? What? Oh, fuck. Something primed. I starfish starfish. That sounds like initiate starfish. Primary daughters get album, doesn't it? It's a good nickname for somebody starfish. Pretty good. Lipiscan. It's like a nickname for a stripper and as karate and I was like a weed street. Wow. Wow. One of five high altitude tests. She's Christ. They shot a bunch of fucking nuclear bombs up in the space just to see what would happen. Oh, these people are so crazy. Crazy people. People that we got running our world are so fucking hilarious. When the people that created weapons. Sure. The people that decided to like test tube and blow shit up and see what you ever.

Speaker 1:          01:01:09       You've seen the video of the one nuclear bomb that they blew up in the ocean where there's all these battleships around it and the water, I'm like, I dunno, like half a mile into the sky and it's just, it's so ridiculous. The people exaggerating. Am I even exaggerating? I might not be mad. I'm like, I wish I was more than 100 feet. It was ridiculously high in the sky and these are battleships, dude, like big ass battleships and this water just flying through the air like somebody made that, that will have a group of people. They made that and then they just fucking did it. They just did it. Let's see what it looks like. That's fucking fascinating that it must've been when it was only theoretical when there was all these anc had sitting around just ending the these ideas, oppenheimer and Einstein and all these motherfuckers with their ideas come together and they think it could be done and they know it could be. It's almost like science compels them to create it. Well, science knowing that's the PR. That's that. That right there errors. The danger, because things get weird at that point, like those fucking signed someone is in control, but other than the scientists themselves

Speaker 4:          01:02:20       and someone always will be and the people that will be would never be able to create that in the first place. They would never be able to come up with this intellectually.

Speaker 3:          01:02:29       That's why scientists are. It's a very interesting thing because they have this idea. They're just seeking knowledge. They're Catholics. No more out. That's what they do and then you know, but the people paying them to do this or gender. It's quite often the military, but look at these fucking guys who just invented that new bird flu. Did you hear about this? Running it through ferret kidneys or something they created. I don't remember how they did. It was like running it through ferrets. So they created apparently something that. What was the, what is it? Thirty percent of the people who got to die or kill something insane. They said it. It would make smallpox look like the common called smallpox is already something that if, if if there was a smallpox outbreak, we'd be fucked. We beat smallpox. Now. Why are they making fucking super dizzy? Because they're just trying to find information.

Speaker 3:          01:03:17       They're exploring the universe and so that's their motivation. Yet what they did is they created a biological nuclear weapon. Now she's all over the fucking planet. There's people in the military mean when someone. I'm sure that some military commander which is looking through there. I was like, Oh Martha, can you get data scientists on the line? I'd like to talk to them and they're like, Hey, do you guys want to make $17,000,000 this week? Send over your research. We'd like to know how to make this biological agent, and then the next thing you know, some fucking government somewhere in the world. I mean, Shit. You think Iran wasn't interested in that or what? Maybe North Korea. Certainly any, any fucking world power would want that weapon. That's a great weapon outside of the fact that it ends up. We'll see. You know, biological weapons, biological weapons have a really.

Speaker 3:          01:04:10       The problem with that one is it might not burn itself out, but biological weapons have a distinct advantage over nuclear weapons because nuclear weapons destroy infrastructure, biological weapons. Just kill a lot of logical lens, so if you have a nice fast moving fucking disease that you've made that you can drop on a city, then you know, fly in there three months down the road, clean up the bodies, you've got a city, you know. Fuck. Yeah. Yeah. So it's, it's, it's better than a fucking nuclear weapon where now you've got a nuclear wasteland that you can't use for a long time. So isn't it

Speaker 4:          01:04:42       strange just comes down to the people that are in control of that kind of power? I almost can't help but be cuts. Right? The only reason why you got to that position in the first place is because you're wanting to do this. Well, yeah. You ended up. Yeah. If you're, if you're one of those guys pushing these buttons, you, you, you, you've always wanted to do this.

Speaker 3:          01:05:03       Yeah. And it puts us in a real bind man, because it doesn't represent us. It doesn't represent us, represent any of us, but even if let's say we spread it, let's say somehow it spreads through and all of a sudden like the consciousness of like all these people who started getting into power, they're, you know, people who are like coming, like people who are coming into power. We didn't have more openminded Internet ideology of how the world works and let's say that just the whole of our government suddenly turns into like the smartest fucking people on. Forgive me for saying this. The smartest people on reddit are now running the United States government. All of a sudden that's the country would be perfect. Fucking.

Speaker 4:          01:05:42       That'd be perfect. There'd be like, no dude. If the intranet ran the world, the world would be beautiful. There will be incredible wine because the Internet is the voice of the people. Really the only voice of the people. It's the only voice we all

Speaker 3:          01:05:53       have there. The only way they're the breaking news stories of be like cute cat pictures and sucking it the. But here's the problem. If that happened in this country and let's say happened in Europe and let's say it happened and parts of a parts of Asia still these pockets, all you need is like two or three fucking pockets of people who are worshiping some mythological entity that they think is a hates gay people and wants women to wear a fucking weird shit or thinks it's okay to like lash people are, I think, I don't remember which country was. I think some countries just as executed someone for. I think it might've been Iran, but that could be propaganda. Who knows? I don't know, but apparently someone. They executed a guy for coming up with a program that allows people to download porn. Yes. Now if you just have a few of these psychopaths out there, they can ruin the whole fucking party.

Speaker 3:          01:06:45       Oh my God. It's like the earth right now has the potential to turn into an awesome party, but you know that thing that happens when two dicks roll into a party, like two Weirdos that nobody invited or like all of a sudden start fucking drinking too much and like trying to pick fights. That's what we have on a planetary scale right now, but then, but the people they're becoming, it used to be it was mostly psychos at the party. Now it's getting to be where there's more and more cool people at the party and we got to figure out how to get the dicks out of the house. That's where we're at right now.

Speaker 4:          01:07:16       Let's get these assholes out here to do is we've got to convert the Dicks, convert whatever dicks that can be converted, convert them to be cool human being. Let them know that to be nice, to be able feels good for you too, and it's the best way to communicate with people. Be Nice to everybody, pump your friends up, help each other out. Be Cool with each other, support each other. Look, look, look out for each other. Develop a community of people that are going to give them all mushrooms. Don't teach you. Why not? Why you calling on my game, kid, there's a thread on mixed martial arts.com. One of them says, why is Joe Rogan so in a mushrooms? Could you see that thing I tweeted today? Obviously written by someone who hasn't done mushrooms, right? Or the Das that you've never done mushrooms. Come on silly.

Speaker 4:          01:08:04       You see that thing I tweeted today? Uh, it's kind of old. I've known about it for whereby they found evidence to help mushrooms. Helping depression. Yeah. I did see that. Look, in this day and age, you know, what they should be doing with mushrooms is studying them. They should have, they should be absolutely decriminalized. They have no one's dying from mushrooms. Okay? What people are doing, they're freaking out. One of the reasons why they're freaking out because life is fucking crazy enough as it is. And a lot of times you're holding a billion things in the back of your head that you're trying to fight off. I don't want to remember. Or You want to pretend you did a better thing that you really didn't take those mushrooms and you're ugly truth. They just thrown into your face like, like diarrhea from the horse, just blah all over you.

Speaker 4:          01:08:49       That's what. It's just like your reality and that's a bad trip. That's not a bad trip. Does it trip? You needed it there. There are no bad trips, Joe. The only difficult trips. Difficult challenging trips. That's the idea. You've got to remove the. I heard that. That's less. You overdose. What I did was a bad job. There's nothing wrong with Brian. It's sort of like if you've got jet fuel and you shoved it into someone's Prius, they'd be like, what the fuck is this in here for? We're not working. Right. We just don't like I couldn't walk Duncan. I was following. My feet would not work. We don't have that. Then you'd have to be like Shaquille O'Neal to handle that, but in this super society or talking about nine slash 11 for bad trips, like seven slash 11, if you're having a bad trip, call it and be like, I'm fucking freaking out.

Speaker 4:          01:09:39       I can't feel my feet. And then they could, you know that they could send over some fucking cool. Well the real problem is we, we're, we're great when we could communicate directly with each other, but when we band together in big groups and then we can't communicate, we get too far away from each other. Then we just start getting dickie with the people that are the furthest away, like, fuck them, man. I'm taking their shit. They're owned by where the good water is and you know that. That's where the lack of it, that the fact that you don't feel all these other people. I think it's an evolving entity. That's what I think. I think the human organism is some crazy technology inventing, evolving organism. I think that the invention of technology though I think is like the whole reason why we're here. I think what we're all doing as standup comedians and as nurses and doctors and we are all supporting the system that keeps alive.

Speaker 4:          01:10:32       The people that make the awesome shit. We're just going to find out that we are technology. That's when you die. You're like, oh, I get it. We're the caterpillar. That becomes the butterfly. We are working towards the invention of this ultimate technology. We just don't see it that way. We think of our lives is I've got to get my shit together and I've got to get my yoga. You know, when I get to yoga, I'm there. I'm home. I am centered, you know, you're just trying to make up for the fact that you know, you've got some weird situation where your husband doesn't fuck anymore. Let's be realistic. You're getting all crazy with your crystals because you ain't get no good dick with them. Chris Crazy with your crystals. But at the end of the day I have a feeling that the whole thing might be in just so we keep

Speaker 6:          01:11:14       buying cooler shit and this weird complex social order that we have is all just fucking the ripples and waves of reality. But the whole thing is pushing towards more improved.

Speaker 3:          01:11:26       No. Yeah. Pushes towards innovation. Like look at what's happening right now with Sopa and Pipa and what you're seeing is a right now technology has surpassed, has their past government and it's surpassed the control mechanisms that are in place in like the entertainment industry to monetize their product. They have to innovate a new way. They have to go

Speaker 6:          01:11:49       the vote on shit online. That's what it should be. It should be. You log in, you have a fucking email address. You know, it's Duncan trussell at the United States of America Dot Com and you fucking log in and you get to vote, period. That's how it should all be done. Yeah, keep the system secure. Don't be an asshole. Don't abuse it. Let's find out what people really want

Speaker 3:          01:12:08       that you know, that's the future. It would be happy

Speaker 5:          01:12:13       down. I know that some dude hacked UFC.com this week. I wanted to find out something

Speaker 6:          01:12:19       and one of the upcoming match. So I don't want you to be motherfucking kidding me. Some little Weirdo dude made this cool. It was actually kind of a cool, weird picture that you would love. It was like a Hitler with a big crazy giant eyes. Did you see it? Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:12:34       But you know, it's a redirect. Is that A. is that as just redecorate? Why do you like to do a site? Because it's so Sopa the

Speaker 6:          01:12:43       UFC supports the, uh, the, uh, the online piracy thing.

Speaker 3:          01:12:47       Why? Why did they did they must not understand it that well. Every media companies doing it because that's what it's for because they're, they're scared. You know what it is, man, it's like you got this fucking problem. People are afraid of afraid to speak up, and a lot of people agreed on this damn thing and now the truth is coming out about the way it works and people are afraid to speak.

Speaker 6:          01:13:04       I don't know enough about it, but I'm going to see them this weekend. I'm going to ask them what it's all about. I don't understand you, so I'm sure there'll be able to explain it.

Speaker 5:          01:13:11       You see Dana Dane as a tweets during when all this was happening. He's was like, I don't give a shit. Yeah, he doesn't give a fuck. He's like, I'm not eating. That's what he said. He goes, I'm not Ebay, lol. He goes up and down the website business. I'm in the flight business. You could not have the guy running that day. You cannot have a better guy. That guy's a cool Dana White Shit.

Speaker 6:          01:13:30       Oh, he was. I Dunno man. He wants to be high with his employees.

Speaker 5:          01:13:34       You don't have to smoke. Yes we do. We're going to do a podcast. No, he doesn't. We don't have to smoke. When Danny would do it, we

Speaker 6:          01:13:40       could have them for sure. We just want to tell him. I don't know if there's a lot of shit. He couldn't talk about it. Now it's big time. Big Time with Fox. Fox, Fox. Fight this weekend and you don't give a fuck. So I'll just talk about it amongst myself. I'm very excited. Wait, the Oh, is that you have seen this week? I know that. I see. Yeah. It's a Damien Maia versus this kid Chris Weidman. He's just a bad ass wrestler from New York. Fucking kids. A beast. He's like one of those up and coming guys strangling, putting people to sleep,

Speaker 4:          01:14:12       taking people down, smashing like veterans and he's taken on that. Damien Maia Jujitsu wizard. That's how bad ass fight.

Speaker 3:          01:14:18       You know what shocking about the UFC man that I never. You don't see unless you come to like alive. UFC seeing somebody get choked out up close is fucking disturbing, man. It's awesome. But man, when you see that fucking, it's like. It's like watching somebody with like, I don't know, the gardening, she just. It just clamps down. It's like watching a clamp just smashed someone's wind pipe. It seems like they can't live after that. It seems like you destroy their neck.

Speaker 4:          01:14:48       Yeah. You feel like it, but no dudes come right back. Judge, you see that USC has the xbox app now where you can just watch live UFC on xbox. You can sit there and pay per view, but through xbox. How much is it? The charger? Xbox, is that what? Yeah, that's sweet. They're going to do it and they're doing them in movie theaters as well. They've done it before I moved here. That would be fucking cool. But you know, checkouts physiologically, not that bad for your body. Head impact is bad. Yeah. Hen impact they're finding out is, you know, you got to limit the amount of times you get hit. That's why for a fighter it's really important to know what to hang it up. There's a certain amount of shots and after that you should really. You should. You know, I know you still like to do it, but you got to think about your feet.

Speaker 3:          01:15:32       Who decides this is the. Does the. Is it always in that decision at the fighter in the UFC?

Speaker 4:          01:15:38       Ultimately it has to be the decision of the fighter unless someone owns him, unless he's a slave. But as an organization, if you kind of know a guy in the organization, if the UFC decided that someone should be fighting for them, that doesn't keep them from fighting, they'll go somewhere else. I mean the, the UFC, you know, does offer advice to guys and they, they, you know, they care very much for their fighters. They have like, you know, like chocolate l, they gave him a great job and part of the reason was they didn't want him to fight anymore. He had this amazing career, but when it's over, it's over. And you know, they, they had one last fight. He lost that. They said, all right, you're right. I'm just going to settle in. And they got an awesome cushy desk job and he travels around and like represents the UFC.

Speaker 4:          01:16:15       And the beauty of that is it's like they took care of them. They're like, they pull them, you know what I mean? Like they said, look, this is, this is it, this is time. Let's, let's just settle the fuck down. You know, let's, let's move on to the next stage of life. You're an author, you're a bad motherfucker. He'll be a bad motherfucker business. He'll be a bad motherfucker to anything. He wants to do a certain point in time, you know, it's good to have somebody cares for you that comes in and steps in. And that's what Dana did. Dana like totally hooked, chuck up. You know, chuck was with him from the beginning. They were there, they were together at the beginning and he's taken care of. Um, and it's, it's awesome. It's awesome to see that. And it's awesome to see a guy who knows, you know what, this is a smart thing to do.

Speaker 4:          01:16:50       I'm just going to step away because it's so hard for fighters. Man. That moment of the moment of competition is so intense and so extreme and victory, you know, I've been there while Chuck Liddell won like some big, big fights. I was like right there during the Hay day when he was in his prime man and having been and having seen that, if you could ever do that ever, you could ever do that, you would want to keep doing it. You would just be convinced, I'm just going to go one more time. I'm going to keep doing it. It's amazing that he could ever stop because it's such a rush for them. I watched him knock these down. I watched him knock Randy coture out twice. She is flatlining guys with these punches. It was crazy and running around. He was the scariest fucking guy on the planet for like a few years.

Speaker 4:          01:17:36       Man. He was terrifying when he was just running shit in the UFC when he was in his true athletic peak. That must have been an amazing feeling. It must've been. That life must have been so crazy and exciting. You're stepping into a cage against the most ferocious guys on the planet and you're smashing them, smashing them in front of the whole world. You know? I mean, he's. His career was incredible man. Just fucking incredible knockouts. The Bible, Lou knockouts, but he was just a beast man when he was, when Chuck Liddell was on, on top when he was at his best man, one of the most exciting guys of all time. So for that guy, you know, it's, it's probably real hard. Jesus. Just accept giddy up in the morning listening to the quiet of your yard as you walk towards your fucking newspaper, that sitting in your front porch and you're looking out there and just people are mowing their lawn.

Speaker 4:          01:18:31       You start shadow box. You start going. Maybe just one more fight. Alright, you get bored? Yeah, back in there. I want to feel a fucking rush. You want to, you know, it's hard for those guys. It's very hard. It's an incredibly difficult transition. I experienced it in the most minute of levels, you know, just tight window and kickboxing. But when I, when I stopped fighting, when I was like 20, 21 or 22 was my last fights, I, I just fucking. It's, it's a, it's a weird thing. It's a hard decision to either feeling, man. I, I get that feeling now that it gets boring. I get that feeling when I delete starcraft for Michael, it's you. The real problem with me, when I was a kid doing martial arts is worried about two things. One, you couldn't make any money. There was no money in I kickboxing.

Speaker 4:          01:19:21       It's nothing back then does. She couldn't even kickbox and Massachusetts, you'd have to drive to Rhode island like we couldn't. It was weird. You could fight in full contact. Taekwondo matches in Massachusetts, but you couldn't kick box. You had to go to Rhode Island for that and they didn't even have more. Tyler, it was just like, it was a, it was a mess. And then there's the brain damage issue, brain damage, which is always a concern. I was always thinking about that because I knew I was like, you know, um, I did not do very well in school, but because I did not want to pay attention, I was just really distracted kid. I'm sure if I was with the wrong parents, they would have drugged me. Especially today. Yeah, it was like super distracted, you know, but I read a lot of Shit and you know, go being like a young kid and not like what the fuck is going on with the world and trying to figure things out and trying to like read as much as you can to try to piece it together yourself. This is a very bizarre place to be. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:20:23       A lot of us get there, right? A lot of people that we know came from a place where when they were really young they were like, what the fuck is going on with the world? How old do you think you were when you had your first? Oh, I think my parents might be fucking crazy thought. Were you like, these people are in charge of telling me what to do. This is nonsense. You make you, you're talking crazy talk here.

Speaker 3:          01:20:45       It happens. It happened for me the first time that I took a lsd a and maybe before that, but when I took Lsd, I, when I took lsd for the first time, I can remember when, whenever you take Lsd, especially, you know, I mean, you know, when I took Lsd, what worries do I have? I'm in fucking high school. There's no, there's nothing in it. There's nothing to. There's no demons to come swimming out of my brain and taunt me with like all the myriad of things you get when you're older. There's fucking nothing we just opened. I'm, I might be upset because like I said, a cheerleader that came over to my house. I couldn't figure out how to kiss her. Maybe that's like the biggest problem I'm having at the time. So, but I, you know, at that time when I did it for the first time and had that initial experience, you know, when you go back to your parents who've never taken it, and if you mentioned to them that you'd even taken it, they might want to put you in a drug rehab or they think you're insane or they think you're getting down the wrong track, you're forced into this place of like, fuck man, I can't, I, you, you guys don't even, you don't even know you.

Speaker 3:          01:21:48       You don't even understand this new way of experiencing life. You know, so. And I think there's a lot of people who spend their whole lives never knowing that you don't have to take psychedelics to get to that place. There's other ways to get to that place. But yeah, it's a very strange thing. And those people who never get to that place, they're the ones who are, a lot of them are, are in control. Right.

Speaker 4:          01:22:11       So your life took an inexorable change when you did acid. That was the point where you look back and you said, this is the point where I went off into this direction.

Speaker 3:          01:22:20       Um, well, I know I'd say that the, the, that, that taking acid started with a series of like books. It started with contact with like, you know, the whole weirdness. My whole weird weirdness started with, or as I recall, it started with me coming upon this book that my mom had called Raja Yoga by Yogi raw mature Rocka, who by the way, it was never a Yogi which just some English mistake and lied about being a Yogi, but is a fascinating story. But the book, you know, that was the first time I'd ever read the idea that you're there, that you're an observer observing yourself, that you, you aren't necessarily the, you, that you think the, you, that can be observed is not you. You're the observer state. The mindfulness, the watch or that's when I, that's the first time I'd come upon the idea of what's that's called the altman.

Speaker 3:          01:23:17       The thing that observes yourself. You know, when you know someone will say, I'm really mad right now. The moment you say I'm mad, you're creating a distinction, you know, between the thing that's observing that you're mad and the thing that's mad, so that observer, that watcher, that's the thing that, that mindfulness is what, you know, throughout my whole life, I try to, you know, go into that place of observing myself rather than being the thing and it's a game that you can play and it really is quite helpful with a variety of, of problems, especially if you get really angry. If you get really angry and you can stop yourself and just watch and there's tools you can use in that book. I remember it said as you walk around, start thinking he is walking. That was one of the tools, like it's in a book and you're a character in a book.

Speaker 3:          01:24:05       So when you're going around you're like, you know, right now he's doing a podcast right now. He is talking and so that's, these are, these are activities designed to create this. Like the watcher, the state of presence of watching. So that started it. That led me to like, you know, I, and then I found out about, you know, I, I, I think I read the electric koolaid acid test, you know, about fucking Ken Kesey and the merry pranksters blasting themselves on acid and going to the world's fair in a bus. And then I read that shit. I remember. Wait, I'll tell you that. I'll stop this weird, weird rant. I remember now. Fucking film strip. That's what it started in my head. I think I was in fourth grade and they showed us a drug film strip. Remember film strips fucking popped up. This guy like it caught. There's a guy I still remember. It's a guy in it. It's a guy in a fucking empty apartment and he's curled against the law in the fetal position and it's an lsd and it looks terrible. And then the narrator says, Lsd can make you experience hallucinations. You can see dragons. And I remember him saying, you could see drag. And I'm like,

Speaker 8:          01:25:14       I want to see it. Sounds awesome. Fuck the empty apartment in the fetal position. I'll figure it out. So that guy's a pussy. What are you crying? So I drag a little bit. It's a gas

Speaker 3:          01:25:31       and that was, that. Put it in my head is like, well, you know, I, I think that that's an interesting thing to explore, but

Speaker 4:          01:25:41       yeah, that's hilarious. So you think that you were like to Dunkin's like Duncan one and Duncan to like Dunkin one is like regular Dunkin growing up, innocent boy. Sure. Boom. Psychedelics. And then Duncan to two point. Oh

Speaker 3:          01:25:53       yeah, yeah. There's definitely a dunk into that. That happened. I'd say. And then that, that Duncan to change too man, because you know as you get older, the best thing that there's two great. The best thing that can happen to you as you get knocked off track, that's the best thing that can happen to you in general because generally the track you're on has been set for you by people who never got off their track. You end up, you end up the child of someone who decided to have you in their twenties, 21, 22. They're not going to know a lot of stuff. They're not going to understand the universe that much unless they were like came from a really good family of artist are intelligent people. Chances are they're scared, hungry, desperate, angry. They don't want to be in the relationship anymore. They don't want to be monogamous anymore.

Speaker 3:          01:26:37       The idea of non monogamy to them might just seem insane. Like who the fuck knows, but you're born into that planet. Your. That's the atmosphere you're born into. That's what you're breathing when you're first born and that can set you on a weird path and that's a very sad path that you can get on. And so hopefully if you're lucky, you'll come across somebody who knocks you off that fucking path. You know? I remember the guy who hooked me up with acid. I remember sitting in the theater of my school because I was taking. I was at drama nerd and I sitting in the theater of my school next to this guy, so the two next to this guy, Brad, and I remember seeing an eye and we're talking and he mentioned tripping on Lsd and I'm like, what is like, oh yeah, I took acid over the weekend. I'm like, well, why? You can get acid

Speaker 9:          01:27:27       the life, the life of somebody must animate this. Somebody the police.

Speaker 3:          01:27:32       I know your folks out there that animate shit. You got to animate this. That, that moment took me to. And this is really weird. Tell me what the first trip was like. I love to. The first trip was, uh, it was white blotter, a white blotter paper. I don't, it was just white blotter, a little p for somehow if you don't know this, uh, lsd gets put on sheets that looked like blotter paper and sometimes they have designed, sometimes they don't, but the name is always a reference to usually as a reference to the design on the sheet. So, uh, you know, purple, Jesus, White Blotter of lips, you know, there's a million different names for the different types of acid, but, so this is just white unit is what it was, but it was really good and I can remember I took it and you have to, you know, it takes 30 to 45 minutes sometimes longer for it to kick in.

Speaker 3:          01:28:26       I still remember I was sitting in my friend's trailer in a trailer park in North Carolina sitting in an empty bathtub, like when it like an empty Jacuzzi tub that was in this trailer and I'm sitting there and they're watching star wars and I'm sitting in this bathtub and all of a sudden the greatest, it's the greatest feeling just started going through my legs and up into my body and it was a fucking sword fight. It was a light Saber fight when I'm listening to that. But all of a sudden now the sounds echoey, like someone's turned an echo up on it. So I was like, man, well my parents kind of bouncing around. It's beautiful and I feel so fucking good. Started laughing. It seems so funny. Then I went outside and lay in the grass. I'm staring at the sky. Everything's beautiful trails. You put your hand in front of your face and it's just this rainbow of hands drifting in front of your face.

Speaker 3:          01:29:21       Everything's breathing. Then my friends come running out because they knew this is the first time I was tripping and they all start jumping over me. They're like jumping over me as I'm laying there and they're laughing and we're all fucking laughing and it's just perfect. Then I remember they pulled their cock out. That's when they pulled that. Y'all started talking. We fucked and fucked and then a dog came by and we grabbed the dog and started fucking the dog. No, no, no. It was beautiful. Spirit of acid is very now. Yeah. There was no fucking happening. There was a lot of like laughing. I remember going into my friend Shitty high school car in like sitting in, like pulling the seat back and looking at the ceiling and I'm looking at the ceiling and it's fucking hieroglyphics or some kind of like ancient writing, you know? I don't even think I knew what Sanskrit was at the time, but I probably be like, oh, I'm seeing Sanskrit. Some kind of runes are glyphs all over my friend's car that she's kind of breathing and warping and it's just beautiful. So yeah, that was the, that was the first time. And once you've had that experience, how do you go back to a world? A normal kind of world?

Speaker 5:          01:30:33       First time I ever did acid. I've, I've told you this before. I met Kurt cobain. How crazy was that?

Speaker 3:          01:30:38       Whoa. Wow. The story

Speaker 5:          01:30:40       again. I think I died this night by the way. I have just been very that no, that this is what made me think of a theory that like every time you die you don't know that you die, but then you left this road and everyone else in this other parallel road, you know, they think you die. Like you know the funeral. And this is where I thought this was the first time I did ask that me and my girlfriend at the time, that was Marissa. We went to go see. We went to go see nirvana and she had an acid and I, I've never done acid before. She goes, let's do acid and cedar vinyl. So we took acid and the opening band was on which, which is some Asian band that just screamed the whole time and it was like, you know, it's kind of like annoying.

Speaker 5:          01:31:21       So I was sitting next to the side of the stage and Kurt cobain comes around the corner and just comes out and it was really dark so no one could see it and he's just standing right next to me. I look over, I'm like, oh my fucking God, it's Kurt cobain. And I was like, Hey, what's up? And he goes, hey, you weren't cheeto. And he held out his bag and I'm like, yeah. And so I held on the cheeto and then suddenly he just like, somebody goes, oh Kurt. And then he just like throws all the cheetos out in the crowd and then it returns back backstage. I'm holding this cheeto and I'm like through the cheetos and the crowd, get a bag of cheetos that he was eating for him. He just threw it at the crowd. He just threw cheetos everywhere. I mean it was. This is like a mosh pit in Dayton, Ohio side of the stage, like a rock club, you know, Harry arena, I think it was

Speaker 4:          01:32:00       a fucking video of Dana white getting in a mosh pit. Yeah. He went into a rage rage against the machine concert. Motherfucker got into mosh pit. She got security guards looking out for him and he jumped to the mosque.

Speaker 3:          01:32:14       So I took this cheeto and I put it in my pocket. Like I'm like, I'm going to save this Cheeto, you know? And then I start tripping really hard and had an amazing concert on the way home. We're driving and we go by in like, I'm driving it and this is a thunderstorm of rain. I'm still tripping, tripping, tripping on acid as responsible citizens. And then this is even better. And I swear to God that you could ask her. I'm not gonna say who she is on here, but we started fucking while I was driving in the rain storm on asset for my first time fucking. And that's where I think I died the first time, one of the first times I died. It might be you guys

Speaker 4:          01:32:50       this. Isn't that a theory that you said to me once?

Speaker 3:          01:32:54       Yeah. It's the idea that when you die, I think. Yeah, you're the one. You've said that before. Yeah. Yeah. It's just that. It's like a car. It's a multiverse idea. The idea is you're a fucking. You know what? Your eternal being, you are an eternal being. Your body is a frequent. It's like a radio. That's the tunes you in. Tune into your specific personality in and the moment you die, that radio frequency pops into something else. So there's no death. There's no you're not. It's not like you die and there's nothing there. Empty emptiness. And it's not like you die and you're born as a baby and get to start over again. It's like something happens. You're driving down the street and you're like, man, why is that guy in my? And then all of a sudden you open your eyes and you're going to work, going to work. And like man, as a weird dream. And then you start that life again, it goes on forever like that,

Speaker 4:          01:33:40       that the horrible idea, especially horrible to bring it up to anybody who's had poor fortune in this life is to somehow or another connected with past lives. You know, when you've ever heard someone say that like, Oh, you must have been a real fuck head in his past life. And it's like, wow, like, what are you real? Are you sure? You sure could it just not be a roll of the dice? And maybe part of your Karma is recognizing that.

Speaker 3:          01:34:05       I think that, yeah, that's why I like the uh, you know, a Buddha, Buddha said, don't, don't think about the afterlife so much. I think even Christ said, I am the god of the living, not the god of the dead. The idea being that with a voice, it's a good. I think real spiritual masters always tend to try to bring people back into the present moment because it's like, you know what? The president has everything. I know when Shit goes wrong in my life, I know why it went wrong. I don't have to go back to when I was a fryer in the 18 hundreds and like fisted a fucking, you know none. I know that if shit's going wrong right now, generally it's like because I'm fucking up now. It's good for and people can get lost. People can start blaming their, their Karma or where they're at right now.

Speaker 3:          01:34:54       I'm past lives and it puts him in this place of stupid hopelessness and they don't do the things they need to do right now to get to a better place. Praise Jesus. Praise the Lord because I hear so many fucking say his name. So many simple things you could do, man. All you at. Here's what you have to do. This is my new theory. Identify the vampire in your life. Find the vampire, identify the parasite. It doesn't have to be that you have parasites in life. It is possible. You could have gotten lucky and there's no parasites and you get off groovy. Sure. No, I'm not saying everyone's got one, but if you got one, if you're walking around with those fucking vampire blues, you've got the fucking heavy heart and you can't feel happy and you feel bad. There may be an action that you need to take that you're afraid to take.

Speaker 3:          01:35:41       That's the vampire and you've got to fucking not even a person. Oh No, I mean it's a situation. A vampire in your life. Find a life sucking situation that you're afraid to kill, and the reason I say vampires because vampire is only go where they're invited and generally the situation that you're in, you invited it in, you invited this thing into your life and now it's sucking your life energy in your blood and your happiness away. Don't it needs. A lot of times you'll try to believe you'll try to convince yourself that this thing is not a vampire, but in your heart, you know you're a servant to a fucking bloodsucker urn felt this thing is like sucking your life as it's away. Sometimes it's doing it with a trade. Quite often there'll be a bad trade. You'll be, you know, whatever the situation you're in and you'll, you'll, you'll, you'll feel like you're in this situation.

Speaker 3:          01:36:33       You know, it's worth it. It's kind of bad, but it's totally worth it. This happens with jobs quite often, you know, or you're like, well, you know, but that's good enough. That's the vampire you gotta take a fucking stake and drive it into. It's hard to. How do you kill a vampire? Two ways. Direct Action. You don't kill a vampire by like making up with a vampire. You don't kill a vampire by like having a sit down and talk with a vampire. You're not going to be able to like, you know, make friends with the vampire. There's two ways to kill a vampire. One, you fucking put a stake in its heart. The other one is light, sunlight, truth, light. That is the greatest metaphor of all time. You shine the light of truth onto the situation, fearlessly analyze it and then you'll destroy it. You know, because if you really allow yourself, if you could act, you gotta add the real problem with people is not recognizing the enemy.

Speaker 3:          01:37:24       It's acting on that enemy. That's the real problem, and that enemy being personal, your personal demons, your your personal jihad. That's a personal issue. You got to fight the beast and it's in the end. You know what I mean? It's like everybody's beast. Different. Chapter two of the Bhagavad Gita, Arginine, dejection. Arginine has drawn between these two forces. He does not want to fight. He drops his bow and God says to him, you've got to rise to the fight. Fight. You're a warrior. This is what you're here for. Fight, fight. It's, it's better to die. It's better to die in a righteous battle. Then goes skulking off into the fucking woods and be a beggar. It's better to fucking do what you do on your award or you got to fucking do it. Man. It fucking sucks. When you're drunk and you want to throw up and you try to not make yourself throw up, just throw up. You'll feel better. You'll feel better in the end when you're puking, it's gonna suck because you're helpless and you can't breathe. Go through it, man. Fucking jab a fucking knife into the foot. Not Literally of course, but yeah, you got to act and you got to make the big fucking decisions sometimes and it's scary. If it wasn't scary, it wouldn't be worth anything.

Speaker 6:          01:38:32       Yeah. For some people it's almost like they don't know how to start. They know that there's action that they need to take in their life, but they're paralyzed trying to think about it, trying to figure out how to start and they can never gather up the courage to get away. It's like a lot of people stay in abusive relationships. They don't. They don't have the courage to lead

Speaker 3:          01:38:49       exactly because it's scary and it and it and it seems like it, you know, there's so many things that people will, like, ideas people will create. They'll keep you trapped and whatever. Prison, urine. It's very similar to and not. I mean what you're talking about in the UFC with these fucking fighters, this is a visual representation of what anyone can do in their life, but you're not getting. Maybe not all of us are going to get, obviously be world class fighters, the inner ring in front of the entire planet and fucking knock someone out, but you have in your life right now, if you haven't already done this, there is. You have the chance to be heroic. You have the ability right now to make a heroic act. They could kill you. That's the thing. These actions, it's not always guaranteed that because you do the right thing, you're going to end up in a great place.

Speaker 3:          01:39:36       You might end up fucked. You might end up, you might end up temporarily in a homeless or you might end up temporarily jobless. If there wasn't risk associated with it, you would have already done it. That's the point. You know, if there wasn't a risk associated with it wouldn't be worth anything. You know, if Mount fucking Himalaya is we're, you know, a little green grass covered hill and apart, nobody takes pictures of them at the top. Putting a flag into what is the danger. Makes it heroic, you know? So sometimes you just have to fucking. I sound like Tony Robbins. Take the leap. Kill the vampire in your life.

Speaker 6:          01:40:12       Kill the vampire. You'll have is a brilliant speech. Dude. You're, you're dead, right? I thought I stopped it because I'm like, not everybody has a bad person in your life, but I didn't know that. That's where your main, that's you're absolutely dead. Right. You know, I, I, I always say that you know, the energy vampires that you have in your life, are you really your number one enemy? They keep you from enjoying good times. You know, there's, there's, everybody knows I one person will, you settle down. You're like, oh, finally I can fucking relax. And you turn on the television and then someone for whatever fucking reason will decide that they have to talk to you now and they want to get angry at you. Now you know, it could be a guy or girl, whoever the fuck it is, it's one person that wants to, they want to have power over you or another and they want to stop you from doing what you want to do.

Speaker 6:          01:40:56       Like there are people that have issues in relationships because one of the persons and then one of the people in the relationship has some sort of a transparent issue with the other person and what they try to do is they try to control that person from doing things that they want to do. Anytime the guy wants to go play, play a basketball or something like that, they come up with a reason why now is the time I would really like you to take me shopping. Or now it's time. It's almost like they want to see if they can drag you away from the thing that you like to do, thus proving that they're the most important thing in your life. And you know what man, that's fucking sad. Well, you know what it is. It's instincts. This is how girls behave if you don't keep the pimp hand strong and that's a fact.

Speaker 6:          01:41:34       That's a fact. The only reason why girls get away with stuff like that is because guys let them get away with it. Just like, you know, the real issue with guys being douche bags to girls of course, is the physical violence issue. It's not fair. It's not fair if you're fucking two chicks getting into fight with each other, you know, two lesbians and you basically the same size, you know, hey, you know, I don't want you to fight, but you know, I don't know why you're fighting, but hopefully you got a good reason. But it's not a mugging. It's not a man beating up a woman. They're so physical fights are completely out of the question either. So, and then what else is left? What else is left? Trying to explain each other to each other, you know, arguing with each other, trying to piece it all together would not understanding their side at all.

Speaker 6:          01:42:19       You know, we, we, we certainly have to protect people from that kind of violence. Right? Yeah. And that's, you know, that's, that's one of the ways that we know that there's some sort of a, a weird disconnect between what we're capable of and the way we currently behave like as a human race. The fact that it's even possible that we have a real issue with men beating the fuck out of women. Like that's a real issue when women who get in relationships and get beat up. That's terrifying. That's terrifying. That's scary shit. Yeah, it's scary. It was a girl that I dated when I was in high school and she was really crazy and she was just, uh, just, she had like super strict Catholic parents and she, she was really pretty and she was just nuts, man. And we, we, we didn't see each other for years.

Speaker 6:          01:43:07       And then one time I was a, at this might not even been years, maybe eight months, I might be exaggerating, but I hadn't seen her in a long time. When you're 17 years old, six months might as well be fucking years. I mean, things are accelerating. Either graduated from high school and, you know what I mean? Um, and I met her and she was telling me that she had this new boyfriend that hit her and that she liked. It was the craziest conversation. And I was like, whoa. And first of all, I was thinking, thank God I never hit her because what have I liked it too? What if you know you, you know what if you date a girl and she would totally start fights and totally do shit to Piss me off. But I never thought you wanted to get like, well I never, you can't hit a girl.

Speaker 6:          01:43:46       Just it's, it's silly face or hit in the vagina to get smacked. She'd like to get in the face. She'd like to get rocked. Yeah, it's crazy. But she was telling me this understanding. No, she was not rationalizing or you're talking about. She was being really honest with me. She was like, I'm so confused. I wasn't a dumb girl. No, no, no, no, no. Talking about a dude. Basically just smacking her around and fucking her like really rough and beat her up. Some girls actually like that. There's like a weird thing in them. That one. I mean obviously they don't want to get injured, but they want to get roughed up. They want to just get hair pulling and smacked him. And this girl was like into getting smacked. It was like really crazy to hear. I was like, I didn't know what to say.

Speaker 6:          01:44:26       I'm like, you know what? I said to her, I said, listen, you can only get hit so many times in the hand before you get brain damage. Okay. You really have to consider that. Sounds like that already have said how this guy's fucking you all the time and every time he's fucking you, he's hitting you in the head. I'm like, do you have headaches? I started asking her things. I asked fighters get headaches, sleep at night. Like I'm a brain doctor or some shit. I was like, you can't let that do hit you in the head. Right? Don't let. But if for whatever reason, like turned her on, can you imagine having to tell someone you shouldn't let that guy hit you in the hat man, because you know what's confusing is guys can be like super loving after they do it because they feel terrible and then they're like really affectionate. Yeah. They're really affectionate with. Some of them aren't even that, you know, but with a lot of people that are the ones that like get drunk and blame it on getting drunk and that's where they're abusing each other

Speaker 7:          01:45:21       world out there and there's a lot of sad homes in America. There's a lot of sad, sad.

Speaker 6:          01:45:26       It's just broken peep, reality broken, people interacting with each other that it's broken. People interact with each other. All could be fixed with mushrooms, with the Duncan Trussell, shamonic institute of America to correct all of these problems with plants. That'd be great. And the wisdom of the indigenous peoples of the Amazon rain forest, combination of chanting and flashlights. We will. Well, the fleshlight uses mandatory when you're meditating at my restaurant because I don't want anybody horny. I don't want like why you're in there and you're, you know, you're supposed to be doing your alms. You're thinking about getting your dick sucked.

Speaker 7:          01:46:00       You know what man, you know, like the way, like what did I read this great autobiography of Timothy Leary and they were talking about, I can't remember the name of the famous house that he lived at, but where there were all tripping out and like, while they're constantly taking lsd, they would do this. They were all swingers. So there, there'd be like guys and girls do and what they was banging guys that were right? Uh, I think. I think so, yeah. I do know fast, but I, I, I think Timothy leary's pretty straight. He was always dating models and shit. Like I think, yeah, but that's why America hated him. A bunch of haters. But what they would do is they would like have this weird thing because what they were trying to do is they're trying to dissolve the react there. They're trying to dissolve all the fucking ego constructs of which one of them is monogamy.

Speaker 7:          01:46:47       Monogamy is an ego construct where you want to be the only person who is fucking the person that you're with and you and they want you to be the only person to be fucking them. This, this is basic way that most people enter into relationships, so what these guys would do is they have married couples and why they would do is randomly to people would be picked a man and a woman to go into this bowling alley that they had and they would stay there for like three days straight and just take acid the whole time and they would always end up fucking and the. So is this idea, but there was a lot of babies where nobody knew who the father was for sure. That I'm sure that happened all the time.

Speaker 6:          01:47:26       Well that was Mckenna's idea was the, an orgy hastick mushroom cultures that existed in his really think that's kind of a lot of it was his imagination of what could have been possible because it doesn't seem like you really explain exactly what these people were doing, you know, 10,000 years ago and chuck a towel. He yoke and all these different places. But he had this idea that this, the. They developed this sort of a orgiastic mushroom style of, of living. And then people would get together and they would just come, you know, so they would raise each others kids, they would all have it all be loving each other at all, taking care of each other's kids. I'm like, wow, that's kind of trippy. You know, it makes me think like, could you live in a world like that? I mean if it, if that we all are just automatically possessive of our loved ones, our sexual partners. You know, your wives, boyfriends and husbands was terrible. Yeah. Well yeah it does. But it also feels great when you have each other to count on and you have this really cool relationship. Know each other. Right? But the idea that someone like, like you're connected, like you, like you, you're not even allowed to touch and other body like everyone else is like, get away, get away, get away, get away. You're connected, you're connected to the one you're connected to. The one thing

Speaker 7:          01:48:36       fields, man, that's it. That's strange. That feeling, that inspires. That is not a loving feeling. It's a fucking.

Speaker 6:          01:48:43       No, no. It's because men and women have completely different wiring. And for a lot of women and not all of them, some women just want dick all around every corner, some women. And that's their prerogative man. If you're young and hot and you want Dick around every corner, you should be able to get it. Like, what does that bad when it's only good when you fucker. You know what I mean? People are. People are God damn crazy. There really are like there's a fucking whore. If she was fucking you, you'd be like, Oh God. So lucky dude. We had one smile and she goes, you want to come up to my room? Oh, showed us, you know, like how come when you score? It's awesome. And when she scores with other dudes, she's a fucking. Well, I'll tell, I'll tell you

Speaker 7:          01:49:19       why. The reason that is is because our descendants were fucking sexually repressed psychopaths and we still have. We still have that in us. And I know there's,

Speaker 6:          01:49:27       that's a little of that. But it's also that we know that girls that are freaks like that. It's a rare thing. It's a weird thing. It's like probably a weird combative thing.

Speaker 7:          01:49:33       Women are getting a really shitty position where they got to feel bad. If you have a few guys, and that's not fair, and I, and I know some of it's genetic, but I know

Speaker 6:          01:49:42       well, every relationship gets stale. Taking out the idea of the genetic why people want men want to reproduce with as many women as possible. Even if you didn't have that, that instinctive nature. There's still the idea that being with one person will just get stale.

Speaker 7:          01:49:56       Imagine this somehow from your mind is removed. All the negative or weird or strange connotations about sex. Sex is just the physical experience of close of oneness with another person, so there's no. Nothing from the ice has been putting your head. Now imagine eating mushrooms and all of a sudden being in the experience of having sex with a group of people with zero sexual inhibitions, with zero guilt, just pure, hedonistic pleasure as you sort of missed. I can be honest

Speaker 6:          01:50:32       with in terms of like a Utopian society, but the way our world runs. It's like my thoughts on it. I have always been, and my advice has always been that when you find someone who you really enjoy hanging out with, hang out with them and whatever, if you get to a point where you really trust them and you're really honest with each other and you're really enjoying each other's, find out what bothers that person. What is it was zero genetic thing that you have maybe that I don't have. What is it? You know? Yeah, yeah, I don't like me in, and if you can do that, if you could find someone you really sync up with and you actually enhance each other, then it relationships are fucking beautiful. The real problem is most people did not even in the exploring their own consciousness, they're not into exploring their own, the origin of their own thoughts, that they're not really into self examination. They're not really into a lot of different things that lead to sometimes problematic conversations that you have, especially when they have a commodity and the commodity is that there an attractive woman and you're in some sort of a weird situation where there's a master, there's a master over you.

Speaker 7:          01:51:39       Penta, and it also depends on the, the way you get into the thing. I mean if you look at the entry mechanism into these things, quite often it's purely based on

Speaker 6:          01:51:47       scality. Yeah, that's the problem is that the drug of sex and it's really exciting and thrilling to get to the. I love you part as quick as possible so the sex can get really intense, you know? And that is one of the things that happens when you really love someone like you. You could fuck someone that you think is hot and it's like a sexual thing and it's, you know, it's really, it's a real big turn on, but it's not like fucking someone that's hot that you love.

Speaker 7:          01:52:14       So yeah, and that first awesome time when you're just getting into a relationship where the person says, I think I'm falling in love with you and you've been feeling that. Holy Shit Man. Fireworks. It's great. How

Speaker 6:          01:52:27       about for some people they'll look for an artificial that you know, like you can if you get lucky and you actually do have that. Wow, that's so lucky. You the stars have to align. So many people get in situations where the person they're with is just a little off man, this whatever it is, just a little off ever. The video that awful.

Speaker 7:          01:52:46       What I consider to be the most grotesque experiment of all time where the fucking. They took a monkey, a little baby monkey and they gave him a wire or did either. I don't even want to talk about this disturbs me so much. They're covered a fucking like a little box with for. Yeah, and the fucking things. Cleaning to it. Oh See, now here's the thing. It's crazy. Some people you see that some people that a lot of people are in that relationship where they're cleaning to something that's not even real and they don't even under. They've like trick themselves into thinking that

Speaker 6:          01:53:18       the real issue is the route. The other person, the issue is that people that are raising these people, the real issue is how do you. You know, everyone starts out neutral with w, whatever blend of personality. I bet almost every kid, unless they have some serious neurological difficulties on almost every kid can be rendered a positive human being by the right people. They're surrounded by the right people. It's like we're. What we're doing is by putting, we're putting the most important thing for the resources of the human race, the youthful people developing into contributing members of society who can actually add to the culture, add to the experience, add to the process, and we're putting the development of our most valuable resource in the hands of everyone and anyone including retards, morons, assholes, douchebags, fuckheads, everyone in between. There's a bunch of crazy motherfuckers shit out kids every day and you can't. You can't say anything about it because then you're Hitler and then you're, you know, you're, you're, you. Are you a fan of eugenics? Do you know how they didn't work in the past? The guess what else isn't working? This overpopulation by monkeys isn't working

Speaker 7:          01:54:20       well. That's why you gotta be a bit of A. I mean if you start waking up to

Speaker 6:          01:54:24       yeah, we got to wake all these people up and figuring out a way to re evaluate or reevaluate will reset people's minds to reset people's what? Whatever it is that your operating system is. How, what, where, where, where it's failing.

Speaker 7:          01:54:37       Well, you, you have to like, you know, sometimes you get these really fucking flattering tweets from people who listen as I'm like, man, I wish I had friends like you guys in my hometown to talk to you. And that's really a super sweet thing to say, but I always think to myself, you know what? Why don't you go, why don't you go make some? Why don't you use fucking tar turned into it? I know it's hard, but I want to get out of the highest. I don't mean just small town. I mean, I don't mean go make some in the sense of light a wicker. I don't mean. No. I mean no like baskets. Now that we're not, we know wicked. Why don't you go? Why don't you go, we've a friend. No, I'm saying what you do is you got to be there. You got to be the force that maybe like throw somebody off their track, you know, you might have to be the thing that does that because my, like the people I owe the most to are the people who manage to fucking knocked me off my track, you know, managed to like fucking bring to me music I'd never heard before showed me books I'd never heard before.

Speaker 7:          01:55:36       And then all of a sudden that steers you out of the fucking public sector, the fucking,

Speaker 6:          01:55:43       well, that's what you're doing. That's what you're doing right now. What you're doing right now is doing that exact same thing to all these hundreds of thousands of people that are listening to this. That's it's the exact same thing you're doing. What you are saying is always been greatest in your life. You're, you're introducing ideas into people's heads that they probably never would have come up with, might not have come up with today. You know, who knows, given the right amount of experience in time, anybody could probably, you know, that's the idea that thoughts aren't, you're your own. You're just tuning into them like some sort of a it. That's it. Well, that's the idea is that it? Because I have struggled with that because I like it. It sounds beautiful. It sounds kind of spooky and crazy, but it also makes me think, I wonder if it's just that the mechanism for retrieving really good, interesting creative ideas that the method, the mechanism for thinking, you have to have all your resources, all your facilitating resources, so the ego has to be fucking completely quiet and if the ego is not completely quiet, the ego is like, I'm going to get some fucking new clothes so I can look slick and I'm thinking about getting news, nose ring.

Speaker 6:          01:56:51       Those rings are pretty hot. Chicks are really into that. I wonder if my hair would be cool if it was blond and you start really tweaking. Your ego starts wigging out on your shit. Maybe I should get myself a new cadillac chicks dig dead Shit and you start fucking. I'm tired of being the VP at work. I'm going to step it up this year. Nobody demand the fucking, you know, you start getting

Speaker 7:          01:57:10       crazy ego. We

Speaker 6:          01:57:13       it like, it cuts out all the noise. It makes, creates too much noise. And the creative mind, the, the, the Zen mind, the humble mine. There's none of resources. So this is a, you know, you use this, this tool and this tool is to say, oh, I'll just pretend they're not even my thoughts. I'm just tuning them into the universe. I'm so humble. So what you're doing is with this philosophy, like putting it through this filter, you've just shut your fucking nasty, stupid ego up by saying that you're just a vessel and you're just tuning in.

Speaker 7:          01:57:42       Well, yeah. And, and, and you know what man, I'm not arguing that. It's like either or here's how I look at it, or it's not either or whatever fucking vehicle you need to use to get to the point where the things turned off. Use it. If you need to conceptualize it by thinking you're connecting with some kind of superintelligent consciousness that just wants the planet to be happier because he doesn't want the planet to dine. It's giving its own voice there as many people as allow it. Whatever

Speaker 6:          01:58:09       vehicle would that is. Any, any ideology like that along the. It's a vehicle for you managing

Speaker 7:          01:58:15       it's a vehicle. You know, it's so and so when you get in a fucking bus to get to point a, B or c, it's not the bus. It's the point that you're getting to use the vehicle, use whatever mechanism you have to use to dissolve your ego to the point where you're not going to turn into a fucking Dick because the moment you start claiming ownership of or whatever it is, man, like I think the most obvious version of it is like super attractive. People who act like they deserve it,

Speaker 4:          01:58:42       who act like they've done something for it. That's unfortunately how ugly that makes it. It makes them like really pretty girl say nasty shit. You just want to say like, do you know how fucking lucky you are? To be as pretty as you are, you should be like so happy all the time to shit on what another girl looks like. Oh my God. It makes them ugly. So unfortunately because of all the shit you could talk about like when a really hot chick shits on a girlfriend not being so pretty like wow, that's like damn that dude. What is more

Speaker 7:          01:59:10       deadly and attractive than a super hot girl who doesn't care that she's super hot. It was managed to overcome all the fucking years of being worshiped by people and it isn't normal and cool.

Speaker 4:          01:59:23       That's a. that's a hard question, but that girl is. She's not going to be one of nine wives in the cult. What do you most to fuck? It's smart for herself and shit. My post apocalyptic cultural have their place. I love that. Well, you know why you can make her the high priestess of, they call it management, but like the way that goes nurse, you just got to fucking ideas. Don't get caught up in like with the ideas. Continue to advance and always analyze, observe, look at all the people around you. Look at all the different influences, all the different things you can draw from online. Take what is useful, analyze yourself, you know, it's a process where we're all a part of this process. We, you and I have both seen each other evolve. We just don't really realize it as much because we evolved together, but if we went back in time 10 years ago to when we met and then like when we meet, we'll use it. It was about 10 years ago. A little over that I think. Really? Yeah. It might've been like 2001 or something. What's it like even before that dude's yeah, I knew slash know. I bet.

Speaker 7:          02:00:21       I bet you don't remember this. I remember the first time that you really. Yes, I was. This was when I was a cory's assistant at the comedy store and we, I was sitting next to you in Newark. I think you had. This was right around when you just started smoking weed or you because you were more. You were kind of a marijuana is starting to become a marijuana advocate at this time, but it wasn't. This was called my annoying phase now, but it was really funny. Yeah, it was an annoying thing. It was really funny because I was like, man, now I was sitting next to you and I at the time I had been. I got, I went through this being a marijuana advocate phase, like, you know, a few, a few years before, but I remember sitting nice and you're talking about weed and as a joke because I didn't know you that well. You didn't know me and as a dumb joke I was like, man, we should be illegal and you shot me this fucking look man. You are, you are allowed to make

Speaker 4:          02:01:11       because you thought out, you put them up on his head. He was all Gary Oldman him on, you know, I said it should be

Speaker 7:          02:01:19       illegal and you seem so paste. And then corey like was like, shut up, shut up. Don't say anything because we didn't know each other and I couldn't seem like a real asshole at the time. But then then I don't remember that at all. I know. I think you'd probably be a little paranoid. I think he tuned me out. I probably would. I don't think I would like, like, like got angry with you. Don't get angry. Probably didn't seem like the morning Dario,

Speaker 6:          02:01:43       one of two things. Either you were trying to make a joke which would be not funny and I wouldn't be bored

Speaker 7:          02:01:48       or I'd be like, what an asshole. Just saying that it was the former. Then after that we started talking on the phone and we start having conversations like

Speaker 6:          02:01:58       this on the phone talking and I used to have these fucking 45 minute phone calls where a call them up because Dunkin was the dude who like you'd say, Hey, I can work Tuesday through Thursday this week ago. Okay, cool. And then we'd know they'd get together and create a schedule you'd called Duncan would get your avail. So me and Duncan just started talking on the phone. I don't know what started it off. We'd have these

Speaker 7:          02:02:17       crazy ass 45 minute fucking while he's working at the comedy store and every now and be like, oh hold on a second dude. Sorry he, he put me on hold. They have to answer some other phone call, flag in your bed with your little swatch baked as fuck. Duggan was highly job every goddamn day

Speaker 6:          02:02:34       there. Yeah, there was. It was a natural progression for me to stay high on the job doing fear factor as well. It's like it all went and did like everybody was high when they were working and that's how you got through work when you started working there, you know, I remember you. You went through this little struggle where he is, you know, you want it to be a comic, but they didn't take you seriously while you're still working there.

Speaker 7:          02:02:52       That's right. I had to go to the vampire man in. Anytime you fucking kill that vampire. If you survive flowers will rain from heaven. I bloom.

Speaker 6:          02:03:07       You can get better. Everybody can get better. We can all of their assets and move forward, but you got to be positive. So fuck. Don't. Don't be convinced that you have anything figured out. Whether it's the secret or Buddhism or whatever the fuck it is. Don't be convinced, man. Don't be given. This world. Might be entirely made up of imagination. It might be, it might be entirely made up of imagination. The more time moves forward, the more I wonder if there's a theory and I believe that you were the first one who introduced me to this theory as well. The theory that your life, the world that you live in, is really something that your mind has created in. As you get older and your body starts to slowly deteriorates and progress towards death in your own particular universe. That's when the shit hits the fan and it all goes down and you've managed to manufacturer this idea inside your mind, the life of your experiences in actual real life when what it really is is just a series of events that have been tied together to prepare you for the next stage of existence, right

Speaker 7:          02:04:09       man, and the more that you can let go of your attachments to this particular life and become the thing that is in throughout the evolutionary cycle, then they'll see a traumatic death.

Speaker 6:          02:04:23       Could you imagine that really does get proved some day that you're and everybody will be like,

Speaker 7:          02:04:28       imagination controls your fucking life. God dammit, I could have made a fucking awesome life. I just fucked up and we wired everything. All the Shitty luck. Could you imagine if that was really the case? You believed what the fuck is? That would be. It would be such evil information that people wouldn't even want it to get out, but then you wouldn't. That would be. That would be a religious issue. People might withhold that. They found out that we are in reality architects of our own world, our own universe, that each one of us is actually that thing. Well, I think, I think. I think that if here's a, here's a weird idea. If there were, imagine there is a hell and the only way that you could keep the people on how is making sure that they didn't realize that, you know, at any second they could turn that hell and the heaven.

Speaker 7:          02:05:13       You have to keep them. You had to keep them like oblivious to this idea. You had realized that the thing you're talking about, the things that obscure the light, so to speak, of making people's lives great. It's like TV. It's the media. Every time you turn the TV on, it's showing you death and destruction. When you turn on the radio, they're talking about wars and bombs everywhere you will look. It's darkness, darkness in darkness. It's like people are really trying to keep our consciousness focused on the dark instead of on the light, you know, but the. But if there was a global movement to try to get people's minds to shift from the obsession with death and all the forms of negativity that so many people are focused on and to turn their minds towards a died towards the beauty and towards friendship, towards like healthy sex and towards embracing each other.

Speaker 7:          02:06:06       Then really we, this entire planet could transform and to some version of heaven, I think some something, a form of paradise, you know, but there a there ultimately and eventually, but right now, how long is it gonna take? I think it's going to take it. It's either going to be going to have to happen right? When it's in it, some form of invention, we either get an invention, we get an alien or we get destruction. It's quote Morrissey. If it's not love, it's the bomb that will bring us together though. It'd be awesome if you didn't quote Morrisey. I'm sorry, but it's a great man. He's great. I've actually. What is his real name? What is his real name? Was that his real name? Is it just going to ask me that? I'm like every Golfer on the planet. It's going to hate me forever if I can't answer that right away because names. Morrissey will be really cool quote. If you just said his name, not just Morrissey. Maybe it's Ronald. Ronald Morris. Ronald Morris. What? Gary Morrissey. No, it's more legitimate quote. So funny how Morris he would never have gotten name like a rapper. He never would have gotten famous if on his albums. That said, Gary,

Speaker 7:          02:07:17       Dude, have you heard Gary? Let's go. It's kind of a mystic. I have a mistake. His name's Gary. Now your mistake has been named Charlotte getting me that. Steven. Steven. By the way, Steve, I knew someone who knew someone

Speaker 1:          02:07:36       who got really into yoga and changed her name. She insisted you call her by her new name. I think there's a useful logan. I understand that. I think there's a usefulness to the. I think that there's that reinvention that's a good tool, man, and I understand why people do that because if you think about your name and where it came from with like we're not getting named in the way people used to get named people and people used to get named on, you know, based on their actions and stuff. They real name would come later. We get named on what some fucking 22 year old dope decided that you're the little pink wriggling thing that you are. It should be called, you know, where my mouth is that what you were named after my name. I don't know where they. I don't know where the name came from, but I do understand this idea of like rebirth or the idea of like once you get knocked off track, why not go really deep and fucking just rename yourself the best cult speech have overheard of my life.

Speaker 1:          02:08:32       That's the way to get people to really drink the Koolaid. Just jump in balls first. Come on man, go for it. Just get in there. So I will take the big jump and change your name into a crazy new name. Your name is Duncan Bitch. If I was joey did. You've been. Duncan sent you a fucking. Now all of a sudden you want to change governments. Well, I mean look at fucking Cat Stevens. Yeah. That's not a good example. Crazy asshole. Fucking murder of Salmon Rushdie. Get outta here, man. Artists didn't work for prince when Prince did it for, um, recording rights reasons. Oh really? An issue with them owning his name. I don't think it. I don't think it always works, I think, but I think sometimes I do. I can understand the usefulness of it as a tool. I can understand it as a way to like create the differentiation between whatever the person that you were in your earlier phases and who you've become. I don't think it's always good. I think if people allow me to name them, I will name them beautiful names that there'll be quite pleased with. How crazy is it? The prince changed his name to a fucking symbol. What? What an amazing move that was. Art. It's really an amazing, amazing move. I mean, that's. That's how you get out of a legal contract. You're not even a name anymore. It's just so fucking squiggly, crazy thing.

Speaker 1:          02:09:44       You know what I mean? The, the, the language of contracts are so ridiculous in the first place. The idea that there's anything you could ever sign away where that person owned you and your likeness. How the fuck can you sell that? You don't own that anymore. You can't use your own likeness. Now you have to use this crazy symbol really in signature. Just like the signing shit. Give up that name. You give up the name Prince or Duncan Trussell, you know, or especially if it's like a Larry the cable guy thing where it was a name he made up. You know, you get a proper. My intellectual property. My first name, my first name is Charles. My name is Charles Charles Duncan. Trussell is now the new, the latest name on twitter right now. Sean. With that, the problem is that God is going to confuse everybody. Going to have a picture of you that looks exactly like your twitter picture and when you change and he's just going to copy and paste it, make his own twitter picture.

Speaker 1:          02:10:39       There's always some mystery. You have an issue. Every time you have an issue, he's going to know a little bit more of a fixture issue and he's going to give you some awesome advice and you can start really getting freaked out as to how this is fake. Duncan trussell really knows how to manage the real Duncan trussell's life and then you eventually just going to live under the assumption that this fake twitter account, Charles Duncan trussell is actually the universe giving you advice through twitter. Can't wait. Charles can't wait to meet. You're not going to get to meet them. You're going to get to communicate with them online. But Charles Duncan trussell will be given you information about what's about to happen. So Joseph, are you about to start a twitter account? No, I'm not doing shit. The Universe is going to do this for us. I love it.

Speaker 1:          02:11:19       Charles Duncan towards what do you have to do is now you know, you have various untold issues in your life. I'm sure we all do. Get online and tweet them and then say, Charles Duncan Trussell, what should I do now? And it's like calling them so I can't imagine you'll come with stupid Charles and I paid them when I was a kid. My name's Joe. It's like, well I was born jets. I started off of course Charles and then my parents I think started just calling me dunk and then I decided that I want it to be called Duncan and instead of Charles and so then that's when I became maybe because you knew that one day you would work with flusher, so it wasn't even.

Speaker 1:          02:12:03       It's not even your middle name. It's my middle name. They just added it later. No, sometimes for some reason in the West when we name people will give them three names. It won't just be a first. Yeah, it'll be like Joseph James Rogan, Joseph James Rogan, Finnegan extra. Now summary. The whole thing's just idiotic. And Brian Allen Bar. So yeah, you just picked you. You got to fucking pick this name, you know, you gotta like you can choose your middle name or your first name. They in fact that there is a first name and some people, they're so narcissistic. They just named their kids after themselves and that's where you're running your jackets. And third, George Foreman, George Foreman named all of his kids. George Echos. Now you're making a little fucking genetic echo is named after. You know. It's just a terrible thing to put into someone's mind. Yeah. My whole family is completely on original.

Speaker 1:          02:12:55       I was Joe. My father's name was Joe. My grandfather's name was Joe. My grandmother's name was really completely unoriginal. Just. Yeah. Yeah, very well. It was the fact I really requested a lot of Joe. That's what I wanted. So I just in my life, in my lineage, you know, when I was creating myself in my imagination, I just thought, I want to really see what happens. If you overdose on Joe Joe's the gate swinging well, who knows? Well, it's unoriginal names. The Fox. Everybody's joke. Come on everybody. Really? Everyone's Brian. You're Brian Allen. Can you imagine if you became a standup and you called yourself Brian Allen b? I need to go to clubs and everybody below. What the fuck man? I thought it was that black guy that interviews comedians. They'd all be coming soon. If you go onto Wolfram Alpha, you can put your name in and see how many people right now are existing with your name.

Speaker 1:          02:13:50       Well, that's pretty rarely want to feel insignificant or I've talked to one of the phone that Joe Rogan, Joe Rogan.com seemed like a nice guy. Ex military guy, but he wanted a lot of money for the site. He saw dollar bills. It also has got his own. He's got his own website running there and he's been doing it for awhile. Yeah, he's an ex military guy. He doesn't look like like ex military. He looks more like a scientist or. Well, when they get older they look like older men. Weird. Brian thinks you should have a flat top, but a fucking knife and his teeth. He. It's like the opposite though. Micro soldier. So Duncan. Yes sir. We leave in the morning. I know Chicago early. I'm going to do the rosie o'donnell show romantic. I'm excited. I'm a Rosie O'Donnell fan.

Speaker 7:          02:14:35       Hey, can I say one thing real quick because I'm fucking cool happened and I want to announce it. I did a south by south. I got invited to go to south by southwest and they offered me this shitty deal. I won't go into it here, but if you want to see. See the deal. Look at Hitler. Gets invited to south by southwest. So great. Is that just complaining because they don't fly the comics at and it's a. it's just a generally a bum deal and I'm just saying this because pretty much right after I did from that video, I got invited to this awesome festival that's happening happening in Austin called the Moon Tower comedy festival and that's happening in April and they just like are doing the press releases today and I just think it's so fucking cool that they like or you know, pay like they're showing that festivals can pay performance, pay airfare and put them up, which isn't that insane and idea. It's just normal, but it's

Speaker 1:          02:15:25       beautiful. I don't understand how anybody ever got away with anybody working for free. When you're making money. I don't get the unless south by southwest with some amazing charity that I don't understand that they're not. It's not a charity, but what are you sure? Uh, yeah. I'm sure. Yeah, I know it's probably all these poor. She wishes that, that just to be sure I have a feeling they would have said it by now based on the awesome videos I've been making. The. Yeah, let's look up and stuff. I said, well, you can't just assume like that, right? I'm getting my apology or start typing a $10,000. Right?

Speaker 7:          02:15:59       Charity. That's nice. Let's see. Charity. Let's see.

Speaker 1:          02:16:06       South by southwest, it seems like they do some stuff for charity. You can impact charity without being rich.

Speaker 7:          02:16:11       I'm sure that they do. I'm sure it's south by southwest as charity, but when you ask artists to perform for free at your festival that sponsored by 16 million different corporations, it's a bit of a charity,

Speaker 1:          02:16:23       strongest memory of south by south to south by southwest 2010 was a rooftop party when the by southwest

Speaker 6:          02:16:30       partygoers spontaneously raised $300 towards the purchase of a wheelchair for the nephew of one attendee. The young man was paralyzed temporarily in the family. Could not afford a wheelchair. That's beautiful. That's beautiful. That's very nice. That's nice and all, but still so many answers and how many people are paying to go see south by southwest? It's expensive.

Speaker 7:          02:16:50       Ah, look, I go to their website. I think the cheapest passes around 100 bucks, but might be more than that. Wow. So they get everybody get everybody to work for free, right? They must pay some. No, I think some of the like a bigger names get paid, but mostly after I did these videos, mostly what I heard from people is that the idea that Co. Here's the concept I'll to to play south by southwest advocate. THe idea behind it is, hey man, it's just we're all having fun out here. It's a party. It's a chance to like hang out with a bunch of other comics and have a good time. We don't invite a lot of comics out, so it's a, it's a, it's an honor to get invited out and you're going to get a chance to perform. We'll put you up In someone's guest bedroom, but we can't pay you and we can't pay for your airfare and we, you know, we.

Speaker 7:          02:17:35       You want to stay in a hotel, you're going to have to pay for your own hotel now. I think that that coming from like a festival that really was a charity, like the make a wish foundation or something that was solely raising money for charity or even a startup festival. What about just a startup festival that seems really cool and isn't making any money? All that. I totally makes it makes sense to me. It'd be really cool, but I think when it's coming from a festival the size of south by southwest, which is a giant festival, I read that 30,000 people come through there a year and they're asking performers to come out for free and to pay for their own ticket. I think there's something in that that's pretty fucked up, dear southwest airlines. If you want me to come, I'll totally do it and I'll pay for everything. Thanks.

Speaker 5:          02:18:20       Airlines, knucklehead. No, veronica rita was right. It was fucking airline manner. They don't even fly the comics, so it really is. I thought you were joking. She told us that at dinner and we both laughed at her and were like, like I was like, oh, you're so silly. I thought you were right. You too. I thought you knew. No, I didn't. No,

Speaker 6:          02:18:41       god damn it. Brian, you spread this information across the world. Now you've confused. No, no, no. I don't know anything about. I don't. I don't look at them. I think it must be an awesome hang. I did one thing. What's one? One festival. I did summerfest in milwaukee. It was fucking great, man. I loved it, but I felt weird because I'm on stage and I'm just doing my regular acts. There's people with babies or holding the babies in the crime, like this is just fucked up, you know? It's just, it's just a. I like doing stand up in a place where people come and see standup. That's it. That's it. But no, I think. I think festivals. I've done festivals, I've sometimes they're fun. I like I did the vancouver comedy festival that comedy festivals are different. I'm saying performing at a music festival. Yeah, that's a little music.

Speaker 6:          02:19:22       Festivals are way more rowdy. It's way this. It's way more likely. The people did not come to see that. There's a big difference. Man. Comedy festivals are amazing. Montreal, montreal, all several years. I think I did it six years. It was fucking great. A whole town know montreal that literally has been privy to these festivals coming in every year. So they have like this really like high palate for comedy. It's a fucking great place. Do comedy. We were supposed to go back in march, but uh, unfortunately the ufc had a move. It's a march date. They had to move the montreal date because no champions were available and they were going to put together a big card for up there. So they postponed it. I was like, damn, I was really looking forward to going back to montreal.

Speaker 7:          02:20:07       Yeah. Well, you know what, my montreal, I don't care about like, I don't want to come across like, I'm like, you gotta fucking you gotta pay up if you want me to. It's not that at all. It's like it's reasonable. just acknowledge something, you know, they did. Yeah, you did. Her pays people fly tower festival pays people, sasquatch pays people and people have argued like standard

Speaker 6:          02:20:30       got really mad at, you know, what the uh, the montreal people and started his own thing just for spite, you know, they call the just for laughs. So he would do it in town. That it. Yeah, there you go. So, but you know when, if you, if you, if you look at what they're doing, like even if you think that they should be paying more, they're like, stan hope does. It's fucking infinitely better than nothing. Nothing. Nothing's ridiculous. Nothing, no hotel room, no airfare.

Speaker 7:          02:20:55       Well no. They said, here's the. They said no hotel room, but they say you can stay in someone's guest bedroom. The fuck here. Stand over someone who live in those days. The other thing that the guy said to me during these emails and the guy who books it is a super nice guy. I, I started feeling guilty because he's a really nice guy, very friendly guy. But he would, he, he couldn't acknowledge the one point that I was making, which is that if you're charging tickets for people to come see performers, you have to pay the performers something. It's just basic logic. That's all. Maybe you don't have enough to pay for everything. Maybe the performers, you know, you can only give them in a hotel and get them out there but don't. Because If you're making them pay for everything, then they're subsidizing your food.

Speaker 7:          02:21:39       Go though just for it to be fun in my opinion, like like if you're looking at ces, the consumer electronics show or any of these huge things, people are usually going because it's what they love and it's a collection and to me I would go just because it would be an awesome party. It'd be awesome doing it and here's the thing, man, here's the problem with that. In my mind, the thing that I can't get past is that the reason it's fun and the reason people are going, it's because the great fucking performers that are there, the movies, unquestionably it wasn't. That was the main argument about the comedy store. Remember the main argument, the ecommerce stores, they were making it out that it was an honor to perform at this star. If they did that every day. You guys are crazy because this is not. This is just a box. We have a microphone and you turn it on. What you're selling here is art and the artists are what create the art you're selling. Are you

Speaker 1:          02:22:26       selling standup comedy? You're not. You're not selling a spot and yeah, it is a popular spot. It's a popular spot because of the artists that performed the period. That's it. And that's the big festivals, the same truth. It's the exact same truth. And, and festivals who are making a shitload of money have this awesome opportunity to make things fair. Fair. That's all you gotta do is make it fair. Isn't the, these concerts like south by southwest, isn't this where like, you know, like, like people go to go, hey, they were looking for people for the next year six, but with vancouver, with montreal, with, and you can say that for any festival. It is that right? It is something where you for comedy that hasn't set up man, they get set up and then they become law. They'd become. This is just how it's done and there's a lot of them that don't make any fucking sense and this is one of them.

Speaker 1:          02:23:13       The idea that you were performed with something where people profit, you know, they make a profit and just pay a little bit. That's the thing With this guy, the guy through my emails, this guy charlie, he seemed really passionate about comedy. He seemed like a really cool guy. It's just if he would just, you know, if they would just make one small step in the direction of being like, you know what? We thought about it. We should pay airfare for the performers to come up with something that's sponsored by southwest. They should be a no brainer, share fair. Just some discount which is drive so much fucking business to the town. To me, and I'm looking at an article about nine ways to profit from south by southwest, but if you weren't there and they're talking about how much figuring out how to profit from this gathering of people, isn't that amazing?

Speaker 1:          02:23:58       That's like, would you look at human beings as some sort of a life form and you look at just what this article says, nine ways to profit from south by southwest. Even if you weren't there, the idea that you could be extracting resources from some spot. You're nowhere near there. You don't even go there and you're just putting out a way to profit to profit and what is that? What are you doing? You're profiting. You're pulling money out somehow or another from someplace. I'm not saying you're doing it illegally. I'm not saying you're doing anything wrong, but the idea that you can do that, the idea that you're just signing checks and sending things out, and I'm extracting money from a situation. There's a lot of people in that one spot. When he invented that one spot and sell them things, it's very fucking strange. Weird. Really strange. When people are weird as, fuck, man, when is south by southwest in march. I don't remember what we need to do. You don't. We need to do. We need to put together an la comedy festival. La is one of the best places to know our own.

Speaker 1:          02:24:52       I want to join anybody else's first. Then you have to put their people on the comedy festival. An ice comedy festival. I, I'll, I'll tell you what, it's not a comedy festival, but I did this. My favorite festival that I ever did was furries. Yeah. How'd you know? I love furries. I love dressing up like at raccoon go. Taylor notel. uh, I know to tell it makes it hard for them to grab your ass. Yeah. I find that some target targets in the way basketball, you know, there's this place up north, there's this place called Nevada city and they have this film fest a lot there and that place has the fucking deepest hardcore hippies I've ever seen in my life. And there's this beautiful river. I think it's the uma river that runs through there and in the day you go swimming in this river, it's so fucking beautiful.

Speaker 1:          02:25:44       It's like this primordial, wherever you jump off rocks. It's called Nevada city, Nevada city council, Nevada. It's. They pronounce it Nevada. It's where all the Nevada city. Yeah. It's like there's a, I think that California. Yes, that's right. Where you're getting into what I think, and I may be wrong about this, what is called the emerald triangle. It's like, right where you start getting more. They grow the buds for the dispensary, slam a jail combine fun. Man. That's a dangerous area too, because they've got a lot of mexican people that go up there to grow pot and guys actually stay there. It's really amazing. I Watched a documentary on it on that show. God damn it, a vanguard ever ever see that show. I believe it's on true tv. One of those reality tv networks. Anyway, these people did an investigative journalism thing where they went into the woods up there, very dense woods up there, and they found like these crazy campsites.

Speaker 1:          02:26:34       So these guys had set up with this guy who was the saint of narcotics. Narcotic st. Yeah. You know, I forget his name. Something to narco, you know, and it's like, wow, they have a saint to watch over them while they're growing drugs. Why not? Whatever, because the thing is, it's like if you think about what they're doing, nothing wrong. Growing drugs, nothing wrong with being a farmer. You're just grabbing something out of the ground. You're not doing anything wrong. You're not evil, you're not bad. But because we happen to exist at a time period in human history or somehow idiots have determined that certain things that grow out of the ground or fucking bad, not only on certain things that have killed anybody. And how about these people are moving through the night with night vision on. They started fucking hiking at 4:00 in the morning because I had to walk like five hours to get to these fucking people to catch them.

Speaker 1:          02:27:21       You know? So the, these guys are hiking through the woods at night to get farmers to catch farmer. Go get mexican farmers catcher, mexican, mexican fucking god of drugs. We kind of stopped these people. That's all they are. Anyone who grows pot, you're just a farmer, a farmer, you know. And it's amazing that they, they forced these people to be fucking. Why do they have guns? They have guns because they have to have guns. They have guns because they're all the way up here because they can't grow it down there. They'll get shot in the head and steal their shit. If you made it illegal to grow corn, corn farmers would have fucking gun. It's like anytime it's, it's a, it's a. Yeah, you have to defend you. It's such a fucking. The consciousness of this country, this world does this, this global entity, this human race, the consciousness of this human race is altering right in front of our eyes with the internet and the internet and psychedelic experiences together. That shit has changed more in this hundred years than at any time ever. The. The idea

Speaker 6:          02:28:22       of how people feel about life on earth, it's so different. yeah. It's so different than at any time and we're riding the wave. We're lucky. We're so lucky. We're were riding with or we are in a dream that is symbolic of our own life and we're slowly decaying and that's when there's a great battle. Will the shit hit the fan? I will. They come up with an intervention that makes me live forever. Tune in next week until I fucking go head on into a semi and wake up 15 years old going to school again.

Speaker 7:          02:28:51       We're going to have the

Speaker 6:          02:28:52       cold. Oh, it's the best already. It's already. People are drawn fucking pictures of us. You ever seen that thing up there? what's that? Homeboy's name pants.
