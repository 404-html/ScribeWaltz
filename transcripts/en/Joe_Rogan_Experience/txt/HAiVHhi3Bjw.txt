Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Turn this up a little bit. Just the daycare. We're up, we're live. We're taking, goddammit. You good Tom Rhodes, everything groovy over there. Indeed sir. This episode is brought to you by tea. There's no ting. I don't need a thing. Audible. Yes. Audible episode is brought to you by audible.com if you go to audible.com forward slash Joe, you will get free 30 days use of audible.com and a a free audio book. audible.com is one of the best resources online. I would say like the best as far as audio content for commuting, for going to the gym for, you know, whatever you have to do. Are you sitting there? It's normally just wasted time. You can have a good time with an audio book and you know, it's a bad ass audio book when you park your car and you're sitting in there cause you don't want it to end.

Speaker 1:          00:00:51       And that's the difference between a regular commute and a commute when you're listening to something cool. Um, in some people say like, well that's what we use your podcast for. Well thank you. I'm glad if that's the case. Thank you very much. I'm glad you enjoy it, but sometimes you probably don't want to listen to me anymore and I feel the same way. I don't want to listen to me anymore. I don't listen to this fucking podcast. Sometimes you gotta mix it up. You want some Joe Rogan some Steinbeck. Mixing it up is important in this fucking life. Don't mix me up. It's time back though. I just, I just don't feel it's a fair comparison. It's not the same heart. Um, I bet Steinbeck. We have a boring fucking podcast. How about that? I fucking said it, Tom Ross. I don't give a fuck dude. I'm gangster when I'm talking about dead dudes.

Speaker 1:          00:01:32       Uh, uh, but anyway, if you go to audible.com forward slash Joe, you get a free audio book is hundreds of thousands of titles there. You can also get podcasts, including the brilliant Dan Carlin hardcore history. Just like one of my favorite podcasts of all time. I've learned more about history from Dan Carlin than I ever did in my three years of barely paying attention college. And all the time that I was in high school, this one dude and his crazy fucking podcast and you can get all of his back order, uh, his episodes, they're brilliant. They're like, they're, they're like, it's not just like a podcast. It's like a show, like he puts on a historical show. It's so dramatic. It's fucking fantastic. I can't, I literally can't recommend it enough. Um, but that's also available on audible.com or also brought to you by hover. Hover is the same company or it's rather is owned by the same people that own ting.

Speaker 1:          00:02:24       And a hover is a really easy intuitive website to purchase web domains and they may get super easy. I've purchased domains from them personally. Um, they, they have free things that other people make you pay for. Like who is domain name privacy, uh, which is like, it's a real pain in the ass if you, uh, if you're a freak and you get some weird shit out there online and you know, people know about it. It was just something back in the day, there was a time Tom Rhodes where if you had party in your mouth.com and you put that up online, people would go after you Dick Party in your mouth. It's just, I'm just saying if that was your thing, somebody just snatching up that donate domain right now. We already did it. We already have. If you go to hover.com forward slash Rogan you get 10% off your domain name registrations.

Speaker 1:          00:03:18       Again, it's super intuitive, very easy. I am not tech savvy by any stretch of the imagination, so if I can go there and do it without a hitch, you can too. Go to [inaudible] dot com forward slash rogue and get 10% off your domain name registrations on. We also have already shift fears, legs.com uh, yes, that's right. There's a bunch of a different silly sites that Brian has registered while the show's been going on, including dig party in your mouth.com. Yeah. And uh, what was the other one? We haven't really gay one that works like Tom Sports or something like, I don't even remember what age it just squirt burt.com. It just took you to death squad to get a desk water squirt. Bert has a special surprise that I can't show on, uh, on the, on the Ustream. They'll kick us off. We're also brought to you by [inaudible] dot com if you've heard about on it before you probably heard about supplements.

Speaker 1:          00:04:10       Uh, but there's other things besides like protein things we sell, including fitness equipment, all like the, in my opinion, the best stuff for developing functional strength and staying fit and just making sure that, you know, just put in the work and make sure that your body functions. It's not saying you have to be a bodybuilder or a super athlete, but I swear to you, have you just put in some work, couple of days a week to three days a week, just exert yourself and you don't necessarily have to have a trainer. You can do it yourself. Um, I think you should learn PR good form whenever you lifting weights or doing anything with kettle bells or anything where it's like, you know, you could hurt yourself, but it was as long as you learn good form and use discipline, you could just follow DVDs. We have two available on at.com from Keith Webber, these extreme kettlebell cardio workout DVDs.

Speaker 1:          00:04:59       You don't need fucking anything else then those DVDs for the rest of your life, they will crush you. Those, those DVDs are amazing and you can do them with like a single 35 pound kettle bell, including the primate bells that we saw it on it that looked like angry chimpanzees. They're fucking bad ass. Um, besides that, there's protein supplements, cognitive enhancing supplements, and during supplements, all kinds of cool shit. You probably heard this all before me talking about it, but there's nothing I can do. Ladies and gentlemen, I must continue talking about it in the same boring manner as before. However, we're almost there. I see the light at the end of the tunnel. Go buy some buffalo jerky son gets a freak on, get some hemp force protein powder. And if you use a code name Brogue and you save 10% off any and all supplements. All right, that's it. God dammit. I think Brian and he cakes coming up. Jeff squad Friday ice house. That's what Friday ice house. You went through it. Yeah. You meet Joey Diaz. Tom Rhodes is Italian town Friday. Yeah. Love to do the show. This is how we roll.

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       Ladies and gentlemen put together shows on the air. So that's it. Friday night,

Speaker 1:          00:06:02       um, uh, and a death squad. Dot TV is Brian's website. If you want to get any of those cool teachers that you see, this kitty cat tee shirts, he has all those up for sale on death squad.tv including tour dates and all that shit. All free for all. Like basically all the dudes we hang out with her was Tony Hinchcliffe for Thompson girl. Like anything that comes up, we have it there. All right. It to the music. Fine. All right,

Speaker 3:          00:06:30       well good.

Speaker 2:          00:06:37       Whoa

Speaker 1:          00:06:38       new shit. Powerful. Yo, there we go. Power for world travel.

Speaker 2:          00:06:45       Tom Rhodes, you're the fucking man, dude, you are. You are in my opinion, if you want to like talk about like the, even if you had to like a romantic poetic version of the life of the standup comedian, then you'd be like an intelligent world traveler who literally literally lives out of a suitcase. Man. He's just happy going from city to city, just making people laugh. But, but smart and well read, you know, you're like a, you're very prolific dude. You're like the re like no one could criticize your road game. This is not nothing they can say like, no. He's like, Oh man, I did 300 data sets here. Oh, it was funny. Tom Rhodes is 365. Okay. And they were all in another country. You fucking out there dude.

Speaker 3:          00:07:25       Uh, you know, I'm living the life I dreamed of man. And I just, I just fell in love with a new country I was in. Well, I and I, I should start out saying death squad, Joe Rogan listeners, man. I was in London in January. Loads of people came to my show in Australia, New Zealand. I always meet cool people, uh, you know, heard me on, on your show. And uh, I was just in New Zealand for a month and I had the greatest trip of my life. I did the, the Auckland, the New Zealand comedy festival in Auckland for two weeks. And then I did this like best of the fest tour that went all over the country and I'd never been in New Zealand before. Wasn't alive. It's epic. It's, it's a habit. Like I went down, I went to Hobbiton. It's there, there's a town there called Hamilton and everybody, all the comedians made fun of Hamilton.

Speaker 3:          00:08:13       Hamilton was, is like the shit hole. It's the Cleveland or whatever. I actually loved it. I had some of the best meals, the food in all the restaurants in New Zealand where it's really expensive but very good. Um, I had great meals. There's a street in Hamilton called Victoria Street and there's a, it is a little tiny park and there's a statute of riff raff. Remember Rocky Horror Picture show? Let's do the time warp again. That Guy Richard O'Brien that played riff Raff, he wrote that song. It says a statue of him, like this gay dude with pumps and like a space suit and a space gun in his hand and it's very appropriate that all the people who do drugs, it's like this drug park and the people are slipping in a real street urgent drug, addicts slipping in and out of the place. But that was brilliant that they had this touch at the entrance of the park or people that use drugs.

Speaker 3:          00:09:10       So, uh, the, the tour manager, I told her they were, cause you know, New Zealand is the land of extreme sports. I wouldn't jump off this fucking chair. And I said the only thing I want to do while I'm in New Zealand is as go to the hobbit house. So she contacted the dude that ran the place and uh, got him tickets cause all those toward all those festival shows were sold out. And this, we got a private tour of, of Hobbiton. It's still there. What does it look like? Does it look, it's up on the hill. It's like I'm one that it's just perfect. There was a, uh, when Peter Jackson was looking around New Zealand, he had to be the finest big tree. Uh, it's the party tree of, of Hobbiton. And so it's this perfect spot that the guy found. So it was a real tree that was there and not still there, just massive, beautiful tree.

Speaker 3:          00:09:59       And there's these hills all around it. And they built the little hobbit houses into the side of the, the thing. And it did people guard them like how they keep, you know, they do tours. It's like 70 bucks. You go on a tour. But we got a private tour from the dude that runs a place. Oh Wow. And so normally you on the tour, you can't like go up to the doors and stuff. You've got to stay behind the little tiny fences. But this dude let us, we stick our heads out of the doors and taking pictures and it was raining. There wasn't very many people there, but um, it was, it was incredible. And then there's a little tavern at the, what are the insides of those things? Looks like nothing. Cause they had the sets built in Wellington, so they just would film people going in, in and out.

Speaker 3:          00:10:38       Right. That was a stupid, but there's the fence that didn't fit that bill bell Baggins jumps over the fence at the beginning. I'm going on a great adventure and the dude let me jump over it. That's fucking awesome. Wow. Yeah. I've never been in New Zealand, but it looks insane. It looked so beautiful. It looks like incredible. Like the mountains. Then the north island year, which they say is the lesser spectacular. Uh, I thought it looked like California, like northern California. And then the South Island is like, that's where all the majestic lord of the rings shots are. And that's really stunning down there. Wow. Wow. And that, why do you say that? They're like the kings of, of uh, extreme sports. Like what they invented, bungee jumping and yeah, that was invented in New Zealand and uh, all these like crazy. They're, that they're all into this crazy, you know, anything extreme.

Speaker 3:          00:11:30       Why, why is that your thing? There's this warrior people, so it goes back to the Maoris and their manliness. And that's the key, the cool thing of, of New Zealand too. They get the, that manly now everything. I saw a dude, very tall, handsome Mallory Guy, about 25 walking in the street in Oakland and he had that tattoo on his face. Oh. And there was a couple Maori, um, comedians and people that worked at the club where I was playing in Oakland and they, I was out, I was asking him about it. I should point out that you're covering your mouth like a, like a gas mask again, like a gas mask over the, exactly. Precisely. Wow. And I asked about it and they were like, oh yeah, that dude's very important in his tribe. He's like, uh, you know, but he was like a young, young Gish dude.

Speaker 3:          00:12:15       He's very important. So he tattoos his mouth. I, you know what, that's an ancient, ancient tradition. Ancient. Yeah. I saw a woman with facial tattoos, Maori women, little tiny things, which must be badges of honor somehow. Ooh, that's, so that's a crazy culture that their ticket to the next level. They're like, well, how about we all tend to our face. Right. How about that? Yeah. I wanted to find out if, you know how they felt about the Mike Tyson copying it. Like if he's like, they think he's a punk, you know, this is a bodybuilder did it too. I've been asked him everything. He had the very Mike Tyson like gigantic dude. He's got it on his phone and do the dance. If you're, if you're going to get the facial tattoo, you know, like the, the Haka. Yeah. Yeah. Isn't that cool? They danced before their opponent and rented them. Yeah. My friend Steph and uh, turned me onto that. He sent it to me the first time he sent it to me. It was like a, it's a beginning of a rugby match and these, uh, uh, the all black,

Speaker 2:          00:13:11       oh my God, it's so intense. It's like the manliest shit that humans have ever done other than like fight with swords. The manliest Shit you could do is that dance? Yeah. Have you seen that? Brion pull it up. Pull it up. Thought Haka Dance. Yeah. Let me see if I could find like a good version of it. Because a, there's a black and white, I think it's an Adidas ad for like Adidas rugby equipment. Yeah. It's just says the Haka Award Dance Rugby. It's the first one. If it just, I love take care.

Speaker 3:          00:13:41       And you know, the Maoris, uh, you know, they were never like colonized. They like constantly fought the British when the British came. Like I read the history of Australia, there's a great book by Robert Hughes called uh, the fatal shore and it's all about the epic founding of Australia who these guys are doing it.

Speaker 4:          00:13:59       Yeah. Was there a beginning? Yeah, we missed the EMS, the dance that would, they just showed a loans. Oh No. Oh, there you go. Oh, the dance keeps going. Yeah. Yeah. It's, yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:14:25       something terrifying about that kind of energy. Yeah. So imagine, you know, like the aboriginals in Australia, when I was going to say from that book, they were very friendly when the British and the convicts came and they're like, you know, rushed out to the boats and bringing them fruit and stuff. The Maoris did nothing but attack these motherfuckers. Imagine you're coming from England and you get off and these native people are doing this dance to you and they're like, we're bashing their heads with rocks and just hiding in caves and guerrilla warfare to the end. I mean, imagine you're like some white Dorky dude from England and you're a ship arrives in New Zealand. He's motherfuckers come out of the cave and do that grunt dancing to get back on the motherfucking boat. Could you imagine if that's your fuck up? Cause that's what it was back then.

Speaker 3:          00:15:09       I mean when they were exploring new countries, there was a lot of, it was just like, you're going to pull into this harbor and let's see what's up. Right? Yeah. But I ain't never seen a white guy before. You never seen one of them before. Captain Cook, the guy he did was his greatest English explorer, I think. You know, he found, uh, Australia and the Cook Islands, they, they killed him in Hawaii. The natives there. Fuck candidate. But he, you know, he had a good career leading up here. Well, he just, he was like, you know, it's taught luck. You never know what you're going to get on certain islands. You know, some bring you fruit, some one, a bachelor you have with the fucking right. Some will eat you and turn you into a shrunken head. I finally figured out what the shrunken head was. I'm watched a show on shrunken heads, like the tradition of doing it. Oh, we only you do that. You're lying around your house. Like, what will I entertain myself? Was it, no, it was a total channel flip. I'm not shrunk in it. It was a total channel flipper. I should, it's creepy. It's creepy as fuck, man. I was, I was under the impression that

Speaker 2:          00:16:08       the scholars in there, it's not, they take the skull out and they're basically shrinking the skin down to like this leatherish smallest thing and then they pull it in to make it like a little purse out of it. It's gangster as fuck.

Speaker 3:          00:16:23       I mean, the shrunken head move is one of the most gangster things ever. You know, they're not just going to take your head and cut it off. They're going to make a little ornament with it. A little. Yeah. It's a little leather ornament. Wow. What the fuck? You know, people who just never bothered like with anything like books and fuck a book. Okay, we're here to make shrunken heads. Well that was it. Like, you know, like a, you know, television and the Internet, you think about it. Cause like back in the old days in England and the way they tortured people, you look at like torture instruments. It was because they didn't have television. Yeah. Like how are we going to entertain herself? Well, that's funny because you know, Biden is imposing or

Speaker 2:          00:17:00       encouraging, endorsing, proposing a tax on the producers of violent movies. Wow. Violent movies, Violent v media, violent video games, and they're considered, they're considering imposing a tax, a special tax on that. I think the opposite. I really believed this, and this is not an indictment on the human race. I think naturally we're just a little fucked up and chimpanzee like, but I think that seeing things like violent movies and violent video games are probably like the most cathartic ways to avoid doing those things in real life. Like there's something that gets satisfied without us having to actually go and kill someone in a war. That's one of the reasons why the most passive people in the world are fucking comic book nerds. I mean, who the hell wants to see damage and destruction more that a comic book nerd going to watch a hulk movie? You go watch the hog and he's smashing and destroying shit or wolverines stabbing dudes with their fucking clause. You know those guys well, her to fly. Right, right, right. That's a really good point. The average dudes were like really into like heavy duty Psi Phi and heavy duty action, you know, action, Scifi films, those kind of Dudes, like they don't, they're not harming people. It's, I think there's a cathartic release and being attached to extreme things without have to actually participate in them.

Speaker 3:          00:18:25       That's a good point. I mean, and they should be concentrating on making society better place and like certain, you know, man, you know, some of the inequality and um, you know, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:18:36       class, I think once you're fucked up already a violence something or another, any kind of violent media can influence you and can excite you. But the reality is you have to be that you have to be fucked up for it to work. And the idea of concentrating on that as a cause, it's not a cost that's causes you've got a mental health issue.

Speaker 3:          00:18:54       Right. That's the thing. It should be, we should be, it should be more concerned about people's mental health. That Guy Andres Breivik, the lunatic in Norway that shot the island, you know, um, he desensitized himself for a year. He sat in his mom's basement and I'd follow that. I was obsessed with that trial and that dude is so fucking sinister. Um, but he, he's thought about shooting people while he was doing it and then he would desensitize himself that I wouldn't, um, you know, his, uh, he could work past that consciousness telling him not to do it. So I mean, that guy was just a sick fuck. Yeah. And not everybody that plays that, millions of people probably played that, uh, you know, world of war craft or whatever the fuck he was into. But yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:19:34       Yeah. Only you can't blame that. It's just doesn't work that way. It's like blaming cars for crashing into people and killing them. It's not, it's not, the video game does make be able people nuts. You got nuts that are reacting to video games and the way to solve that. It's not taking away the video games or tax of video games. The way to solve that is find out what the fuck is wrong with people that makes them do that. What is it? What is it that makes a person able to commit horrific acts? Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:20:02       I look at the dude in Cleveland. He kept those girls, you know, he's torturing them and he's raping them for like 10 years. What, what media was he until well, magazines. Was He reading? You know what, Eh, um, you know, always life. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:20:17       Yeah. Well, or I don't think it had anything to do with that. I think someone dehumanize him. Probably a long time ago. If someone raised him in some horrific environment, they created a monster, right? Somehow or another through circumstance, nurture nature, whatever. You got a monster. I'm more scared of ex military than I am with people that play too much hardcore video games. And you should be, yeah, you should, but you should be scared of anybody who's taking life. You know, once you, once you've taken someone's life and done it, you know, and to a point where it's sanctioned. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       It's, it's problematic. Not Everybody has a discipline, the handle, something like that. You know, a lot of that's, you know, it's admirable how many guys can be disciplined to come back from that and be okay. But for a lot of people know a lot of people, it's just that that PTSD man is just unbearable for a lot of those guys. If they say that one of the best things for PTSD is Mtma is a ecstasy and they're having headway in, um, and doing that in, in therapeutic, uh, with therapeutic applications of Mtma and the helping people that have, uh, all sorts of PTSD, post traumatic stress disorder for people don't like acronyms. That's telling me an acronym. Is it, is it an acronym like NASA, when you say it, that's an acronym, right? I don't know. What is it when it's just like CIA, you know, you're not calling it Chia.

Speaker 1:          00:21:39       I can't spell restaurant. Yeah. Restaurant. I rely on my iPhone for that. I get to res to, yeah, man. Remember when you used to have to fucking write out a paper and turn it into school? You have to act. You just have to write it out and know how to spell each number. One of those words. Now I just get close and it gives me a real load, squiggly line to do a little right quick. I'm like, yeah, that's what I was looking for. You know, I don't, and that's all you need. It's not like you need to know that. It's kind of funny how little you do know though. It's Kinda funny how little, you know, like my eyes are going, when I look at things like as far as like the reach of my hand, I'm fine, but when I get close for whatever reason, like reading things close, it's just blurry. It's fucked now. And um, when I, when I see things like, um, I have to like find like the place where it works.

Speaker 5:          00:22:37       Yeah. Hipster glasses. Dude. I don't know why you don't do it. I think glasses are cool. If I could wear glasses, I wear glasses every day. I don't remember what my point was, what we were talking about before I went and says blessed the video games. Torture people. A soldier's seeing, seen combat and have an ecstasy treatments. The shark that was found off the coast of Huntington beach might be a road record. Why Spreaker shark? Did you say shocked? It was found or check this out. It was caught off of, oh Geez. It's 11 foot shark was caught Monday morning, uh, outside of Huntington beach and Catalina Island. The size of that fucking thing. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:23:13       1000, 323 pounds. What the fuck? Wow. Oh God damn it. This guy's beard. It is that, that, that world, if that thing could fucking fly, okay, if sharks instead of swimming around, wow, the three d rounds, if they could fly, if they were on our world and they could just fly around and eat people the way they move through the ocean, God damn. Would it be scary? The ocean is so much more fucked up. That's why nothing ever gets done. That's the shows that it's, there's

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       a benefit like as far as progress to having one intellectually superior species that gets to control the food chain. That gets to put a halt to all the bullshit and then figure out things like roofs and the Internet and cars. Because if you can't keep those things from eating you, you wind up with the ocean where no one ever builds a fucking house. You're best. Ocean is like a fucking one of those crabs. Hermit crabs. They just scoot to the next little shell and climb under it, but that's, shell only exists because somebody eight whoever was living in it, somebody found it and ate it and now you're going to hide it in there. You're going to fall. You're going to hide inside of his body cavity. That's the ocean. That's why there's, there's no one that's phones in the ocean. There's nothing gets done in there.

Speaker 2:          00:24:25       He just, it's a constant move. It's three d you can control things. The thing that made us able to rise above all the other animals, so we are the control and lockdown areas and put up fences. We can keep things out, can't keep anything out in the ocean pitch. The ocean is just the ocean. It's just a wild brown bag and there's no way to solve that. So all the dolphins in the world, you know, as smart as they are, it's supposed to be as smart as us. They never figured out a fucking house. They never figured out how to build some shelter where they could just like get I from tied to get eaten by sharks. How you guys want to do this? Let's make a house or something like something with a shark. Can't get through Barb wire. They can't do it. There's not enough time. Keep moving. Keep moving. Get more fish. Go, go, go those Japanese bolts fucking rotten. You should turn that into a bit. That's brilliant. Thanks. Let's try and make, make a note of that one. That's brilliant. That's a great bit. Alright, what did I say again?

Speaker 5:          00:25:19       What if for the future we had to live underneath the ocean because we, you know, the air pollution or the weather or something like that forces us to have to build houses. They would do that before outer space. The atmosphere. I mean you could be like, you could say, hey, we need to build this house under ground here instead of having to go up space. Oh you forgot the ranch. You have to come back. Well, we'd get lonely. Yeah, that'd be pretty bad ass though. If like we all like our walls were just like looking inside

Speaker 2:          00:25:48       under anything. How much shit eats things with its face in the ocean. Just think of how crazy the ocean is. It's just one big motherfucker trying to eat a smaller motherfucker while I'm even bigger. Motherfucker tries to eat him. Like that's one of the coolest things about catching a fish and having an attack by a shark while you're reeling in. And have you ever had that happen?

Speaker 5:          00:26:08       No. Reeling it in. Wallin Shark is by yeah

Speaker 2:          00:26:11       me neither. But it looks awesome. That's something I'd like to experience but I've seen guys do that and like deep sea fishing, like they catch a big tuna or something like that and it has to bring in a fucking shark. Attacks it and tears it in half. If you were seeing like the pictures and the images online. Yeah, it's fucking fascinating cause that's what the the ocean, it's just just a fucking crazy gangster fight with your face all day. The biggest shit trying to eat the biggest shit. I mean a tuna is a bad motherfucker just running around jacking smaller fish, but not small. Nope. Shark comes along. Jack's the tuna. It's just a wild race. We pulled the sharks out where the top of the food chain,

Speaker 3:          00:26:48       I love when I lived in Holland, the the symbol of the lottery in Holland is a big fish eating a little fish. Oh my God. Yeah. That's, that's true to life. You got money is big fish for a little while till you're fucked. Till the fucking shark comes along. You crazy ass loses it. I bet if you win the lottery, I bet you were just immediately assaulted by con people. Yeah. Bit Con Artists. Just look for someone who won the lottery and like this one. The fucker. Thanks buddy. It comes easy. I just talk him into investment. I don't invest in a wonderful investment on fraternity. Don't go on television. Don't, don't hold. Don't, don't take pictures of you holding the big check. Yeah. Wonderful. Wonderful opportunities.

Speaker 3:          00:27:29       Holding this money that you think you deserve. The whole idea of a lot of these fucking ridiculous, well they say the money was originally supposed to go to education in this country and then yeah, none of it. You know what they realized the more educated people are, the less likely that I play the fucking lottery. They'd be cutting their own feet. Sold that United States that the lottery thing. Remember that does that way. Yeah. And as it went state by state and gambling where it's allowed, they always sell it to the public saying that the biggest portion of this money will go to education and the schools and everything. We've been broke for the less 10 20 years. And you know, where's that? Where's that promise? Nobody remembers the, well it certainly should go to something good cause you're just stealing money from crazy people. That's what you're doing.

Speaker 3:          00:28:14       You're giving people the chance to throw money away in the very unlikely possibility than my winsome. And like, it's like I grew up in Orlando and there's the East West Expressway and it was a toll road and they said when they built it in the early eighties that once it was paid for that take the tolls down, but they never did it just now. They raised the prices. It's like that lottery casino thing. It's like you can sell it to the people and then they'll fucking forget 10 years from now. Once you establish that money's coming in, it's very difficult to stop that. Then no one ever likes to bridge things free now. Nobody ever has enough. Especially

Speaker 2:          00:28:50       it's like nine bucks a pop, like you go over the Gw. I think in New York now it's like, correct me if I'm wrong, so I think it's like $9 or at least it might even be more, but every time you're going there you're getting a hit. When I was living there, I think it was like seven 50 or something like that and I was like, this is insane. Like every person that comes over this bridge has to pay $7 just to get into the city. That's like some gangster shit, you know, because I lived in Boston and Boston, you could take like toll roads but you can also get to it. Like there's ways to get where you didn't have to pay anything. You didn't, if you didn't go on the mass turnpike, like there's ways you can go where he didn't have a toll, but there's no way of getting a New York City lets you paying somebody. You want to take those bridges from Staten Island, you can pay me bitch, you're coming in from Jersey, pay me. You got to pay to get in here dog. It's like an,

Speaker 3:          00:29:37       it doesn't cost anything to leave. It doesn't cost of live in New York twice and uh, deleted all of my funds and uh, both times when I moved down in New York, I, as I crossed the free bridge, I thought it doesn't cost anything to leave. Isn't that fascinating too? Is it to regulate how many people come in? Is it to mitigate traffic and to make it like problematic because it cost so much money? Maybe a Carpool, is that the idea? To tell you a little story? Sure. Uh, uh, it is a big story actually, and I was reminded of, but you're talking about the George Washington Bridge and when I was 20 years old, I lived in Washington heights for a year. Worst Year of my life. Why? Just the worst year of my life. I, I wasn't ready as a comedian. Oh, how old were you? 20. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'd only been doing it like three years.

Speaker 3:          00:30:23       I, you know, I didn't have been doing it three years by the time we were just sweating. I started at 17 Bates. Where'd you start? Orlando powerful. And Lando produced a couple of good things and uh, uh, anyway, so I always swore if I ever had any money I would live in New York was style. So when my Sitcom was finished, a 98, 99, I moved to New York City and I got a rock star apartment in the Wall Street area. Oh, you did not considered one of the first skyscrapers ever built a 20 stories tall. It's at the entrance of a Wall Street. The entrance of Wall Street. It's Trinity Churches Right there. Only on the 18th floor where their marble balconies. I had three marble balconies. I was on this corner unit, just pimp spot. Oh my three blocks from the World Trade Center. Oh my goodness. A 16 foot tall ceilings.

Speaker 3:          00:31:16       I could lie in my bed. Look up at the World Trade Center. It must've been, it was, it was fantastic. But it was a time in my life, you know, the Sitcom had ended. I, I felt I was angry. I was angry and I was, I was, I was searching for meaning and, and uh, what was important in life and what was making you angry? I just, you know, I had the Sitcom and it didn't work out and then I just, you know, I wanted to just go focus on being a comedian and live in New York. So the Dalai Lama was going to give a speech for free in central park on happiness for six months. I had the flyer on my refrigerator. Nothing in the world was going to make me miss the Dalai Lama's speech on happiness. So the night before, I'm headlining at Caroline's on Broadway.

Speaker 3:          00:32:07       And there were these two Puerto Rican lesbian strippers and they loved me and they stuck around after the show and they wanted to talk to me and where we're talking. And then they, they invited me out with them. And you know what, uh, there was the queen bee and the other girl, the other girl was off limits because she had a boyfriend. I ain't give a fuck about the other girl. It was all about the queen bee and the other girl was in love with the Queen Bee cause she was making all the, all the decisions and making everything happen. Wow. So who's she? The Queen Bee had a car. We're driving down to the village somewhere. Uh, they said they had ecstasy. Do I want to do ecstasy? And I'm like, hell yeah. We go to some lounge and we're drinking Pinot Grigio on ice. And I had never had Pinot Grigio and my night to this day, I love Pinot Grigio cause it reminds me of this evening.

Speaker 3:          00:32:58       It's a perfect, uh, you know, like red wine is an autumn winter thing. Uh, but, but a dry white wine, like a Pinot Grigio is great in summer. So we're in, you know, we're drinking and we're having a great time. And, uh, you know, after about an hour, you know, this ecstasy starts thumping and this girl, the queen bee wanted to go to some dance club. We go to some dance club in Soho. It's packed. I didn't want to be a packed dance club. I want to be with these girls. She knew the DJ. We get up these steps were in this private area behind the DJ. No one can see us, the Djs like 10, 15 feet in front of it, just like jamming and the place is packed downstairs but you can't see them. And we got this horse shoe leather couch and we're just racking and she's got more bottles of Pinot Grigio on ice and we're just fucking dancing and grinding on each other.

Speaker 3:          00:33:48       And we go back to my apartment and about five o'clock in the morning, something like that. And, you know, we dance on my furniture and we'll play music and stuff. And we got in my bed and honestly there was no sex. Uh, we had our bottoms underwear on and it was so tender and just resting and kissing and tasting of fleshing and touching of private areas. And the, at one point the queen bee got up on her knees and she starts French kissing this other girl and she's rubbing her mound. What? She's just kissing her. And I got behind this, uh, behind the Queen Bee and I just start kissing this big beautiful brown bulbous acid. Mm hmm. I got my hands up on the top curvature of it and I pulled her panties aside, them stuck my nose in her honey pot and I'm just tasting these delicious flesh rose petals and um, I overslept and I missed the Dalai Lama's.

Speaker 2:          00:34:54       You when you win, why would you, why would you even think that that would be a bad thing? The Dalai Lama joke, it's a true story, but it's not a joke. It's actually a true story story. The Dalai Lama represents a, an interesting point of view and that's it. You know the idea that this guys you guys guy for to find out what happiness is, the eye, it's the idea of a one, a one figurehead like that is kind of preposterous to the idea of enlightenment. The idea, especially if you're dealing with a guy who dresses like a wizard and doesn't fuck, he doesn't get to have sex. He's never had sex. I mean he could if he wanted to, but he thinks that it complicates that. I feel bad the Dalai Lama because

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       Richard Gere always wants to hang out with, you can see the Dalai Lama like a pulling Richard Gere aside one day going, hey Richard, you ever considered Scientology? Whatever. I had to imagine the conversations the Dalai Lama must have with like Sharon Stone or he's like, yeah, yeah, I can't believe they chose her either. Yeah, I mean, yeah, I mean, look, yes,

Speaker 2:          00:36:03       a lot of movies, but you're amazing and base against tank. I thought you were amazing and the, they didn't think you could pull it off in the second one. You pulled it off in the second one. Did you see this basic instinct too? It's a horror movie. It changed from, it changed from an erotic film when Sharon Stone was young too. Uh, like uh, like a panic moment. Solid. Yeah. Fuck yeah, I did Sun. I'm a diligent worker when it comes to watching stupid shit that I might be able to make fun of. She's in it. Right? But she was like 50 and I'm not joking. She show anything like that nipple, the whole leg thing. But there's a feeling that you get when a 50 year old woman who's trying like really hard to be sexy. Like I dunno if she was directed in that way, but when you're 50 you realize by the time you 50, he realize it's mostly all bullshit.

Speaker 2:          00:36:47       Okay, what are we doing here? You know, if we're going to fuck, we're going to fuck. But all of this like sultry shit that you might get away with when you're 20. It's because you, you're, you're a a spell when you're 20. When a woman is in her young twenties. She the reason why they have this idea of themselves, it's so inflated like really beautiful girls is because they're like magic. Like you were around them and get like your mood changes, you draw towards them, you soften your personality though or were pick it up or whatever. You need to get me the lucky a little bit more. It's like a drug. It's like a fascinating orotic draw. But then when they get 50 and they're still doing the same thing, then it's like, oh shit, what's wrong with her? Oh fuck. So when you see across her leg, just like the real moment of panic where I would think about me in my younger days, if I was in that scenario, I would, I would say, okay, I gotta get the Fuck Outta here. It was that moment, 50 year old lady shows you her gapper and then closes the legs over and you're like, nope,

Speaker 1:          00:37:49       got gotta go right now I am going right.

Speaker 2:          00:37:52       That is not the way like a healthy sexually, you know, confident 50 year old woman would would fuck you.

Speaker 1:          00:37:59       I can't believe they just had her do it again. That's so lame and seeing over two lanes.

Speaker 2:          00:38:04       Oh, sorry. It was so unnecessary,

Speaker 1:          00:38:06       you know, I mean, what's Hollywood unnecessary ideas? Well,

Speaker 2:          00:38:11       well, I think it's like someone who's never done standing up trying to craft a joke on this is going to work. You know, you don't really have a chance to vet it. You just have to put it out there as a movie and hope that people get it. And the first basic jeans to instinct was really fucking, you know, it was well received. It wasn't the best movie in the world, but it was kinda fun. It's, you know, it's took your, your interest and she's sexy as fuck, man. Old Sharon Stone

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       is sexy as fuck that we'll miss suck structurally. Perfect, beautiful, beautiful woman and a powerful actress. But when you're 50, keep, keep your gabber shut.

Speaker 3:          00:38:45       What else did she do? She didn't, she didn't done anything lately. I don't know. She does liver, liver, liver.

Speaker 1:          00:38:52       That was quite awhile ago. I think she did that one thing where they were interviewing her about, uh, the earthquake in China. And she said that she believed, she said, well maybe it's Karma for what they do to Tibet cause I'm friends with the Dalai Lama's, my friend. And it's like she had to apologize for it. I think it cost her like one of her perfume things or something. But that's just such a crazy way of thinking that a bunch of random strangers that did it.

Speaker 3:          00:39:20       Huge March man. That's a huge market. You go over there and it's funny, you go to Europe, you go to China and you see like huge actors that are doing commercials but they would never do in the states. Japan, right. Pick Japan also. But China and uh, what Deniros like on some coffee thing in Italy, Robert Deniro, he's a like symbol of this. Some little espresso. That's hilarious. Wow. That's so weird. Yeah. Well I think it's just like Leonardo Dicaprio does commercials and like Japan and

Speaker 1:          00:39:52       I think, I don't believe that you should take anybody's getaway. If they fuck up and say something stupid,

Speaker 3:          00:39:57       people can be ultimately say back the truck up and grabbed the money baby. Cause they said something stupid. I mean, she said a stupid thing. She probably didn't mean it. It's probably didn't realize how fast your heads so far up in her ass. And she had her little buddy, the Dalai Lama, to be impressed that she stood up to mean China. China is awesome. Just stupid is a really cool place, man. Well, I'm sure China is awesome. I haven't been, but these are just people. There's people that died in an earthquake. It's Karma because we massive too. It's like saying, you know what I mean? Look, the United States is a massive place. Like, you know, something happens somewhere. It's just, you know, uh, we're a big landmass it China.

Speaker 1:          00:40:38       Well, it's, and again, it's the people who died didn't have anything to do with anything that happened to Tibet. So how the fuck is it Karma? It's, are you saying, is that in your vision that the emperor is the overlord and you know, he really does have all the people under his spell and they're, they're responsible for his actions as

Speaker 3:          00:40:55       well. Because these are just regular folks. I was just in New Zealand and the Dalai Lama is coming there. He's, I think he's there right now. Does he knows where that road is? Doing a little toy. Yeah, he does. He's doing a little tour, but he wears them a red lace lingerie underneath it. Um, he's hotlist still in like Auckland and Christchurch and Dun Eden and it's the happiness thing. So I mean that was when I, that was like 99 when my story happened. So that guy still doing the same act, pushing that happiness show work. Nobody's happy. He's saying the way to be happy as a dress like a wizard and don't fuck, I'm not buying, buying it.

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       We get head. I guess. It's just seems like you're wasting it. I Get a light saber. I'm not wearing the robe. It seems like you would want someone to make love to, whether it's a man or a woman would want someone gets cold at nights, but it's also fun. It's a part of life. It's a part of life is expressing affection through your body feels good. You know, it's recreational as well. You know, you're going to exercise. It's great when people say, well, you know, recreational sex isn't healthy. We can have recreational sex. You can. You can. It can be done. People have done it forever. It's shut up just because you can't handle it. People have, it's not, it's just touching bodies together

Speaker 3:          00:42:11       better. When you get older though, like dude, the girls finally go, Oh yeah, we could just have casual sex. You know, I'm 35 again. The American women, women in different countries have different heads,

Speaker 1:          00:42:21       completely different attitudes and it's shocking. It's shocking. You go to, you know, you in European countries, they're so likable, like much more like man, like man,

Speaker 3:          00:42:31       they fucked like men. Like they want to do it all the time too. It was like a lot of American women. It's like, oh, I'm going to break him off a piece every once in a while. I like it. I like their dog treats or something. Okay, here's a guy you did good. You know you've washed the cars and take out the trash and cut the grass. All right, here's, here's your dog treat man. I'm euro trash. So weak. I just think

Speaker 1:          00:42:52       did, it's probably because the people that came over here, like the very first wave periods there. Yeah. And I think that that, that initial run, that initial thing that started off this country somehow or another, a fiber of it's still fucking sticks and there's a lot of slut shaming and there's a lot of like weak, angry people that are like pointing fingers and shaming someone for enjoying something a day. Enjoy as well. You know, like slut shaming. That's the, that is all Douche bags. Any guy that like you like rails on a girl because she wants her exact term slut shaming. Yeah, man. That's what it is. It's like a guy's a stud. If he goes out here, we went out to King Kune. We had sex with two different girls, different girls every day. It was crazy. Wow. My guts and nuttiest weekend ever.

Speaker 1:          00:43:40       But if a girl tells you she fuck two different guys for a week, you below can a fucking whore. He probably gonna get aids. You gotta give it to my brother. Oh fuck you bitch. You know what I mean? It's like it's, it's, it's ridiculous. People should be able to deal with ever the fuck they want to do. But so for some women they know that that backlash and not just from, from men, but that backlash from women too because if women are out there giving it up, you know, like that's fucking horse. She'll just fuck anybody, you know. She's never going to get fucking married cause she just fuck salary money. Those kind of women had to make the world go round. They do. You need them all right. They keep a lot of guys happy. Well you don't, so you need,

Speaker 3:          00:44:15       I think that would be a lot of that. A lot less savage killers and, and a fucking lunatics in this country. If you know a women were fucking more, you know, these are dudes, you know, what would help a lot. Just a little, just a little more, you know, legalized floods in general. There you guys, prostitution would help a, I think [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       pos. If you managed legalize prostitution, I think it probably lower the crime rate. I really do. I mean it's theoretical. Don't go like fucking citing me as a study.

Speaker 3:          00:44:41       Holland does it and the, the women have to be tested every like six months and it's a, they pay taxes as well. It's, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:44:48       did you see those two women that were retiring than it fucked for like 50 years? When was that? Did you see that? Oh my God.

Speaker 3:          00:44:57       Hello? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:45:00       I didn't want to shame them so let's not show their, for their images. But the, anyway, the point of news item, it was so depressing. They just fucked anybody who came through the door for like

Speaker 3:          00:45:07       50 years. The Amsterdam girls are twin sisters. They just retired. They just sat in the window for like the last 50 years that their oldest prostitutes and answer,

Speaker 2:          00:45:18       how's a Wowza? Yeah, it's a different week. I think we have to recognize that we have a version of how, how society is, but the, the rest of the world, which is also exactly like us as far as like technology, civilization, laws, money, exact them. I mean basically you're, you're in Europe. Their systems are different, you know, the, the languages are different, but everything is modern. You know, if you're in, if you're in Montreal, Canada or if you're in Berlin, everything is super modern right now. There's only, it's everything is like we live in a time where like there's never been like more equality as far as like uh, access to information.

Speaker 3:          00:46:03       Right. We all, we all have the same tools. I mean if you have, if you can afford some certain basic things, you know, computer

Speaker 2:          00:46:09       yeah. As far as like in information. But as far as money, it's probably like the widest gap ever. Isn't that weird? It's like as far as money, like there's like a small core group like the, well you know when they call them one percenters who have most of the money and then everybody else. That's kind of fascinating. You would think that maybe eventually that trend will even out, you know, cause it seems like the only way if you looked at it, and this is obviously not, not looking at the system logically or even educated with an educated opinion of this financial system. But if you looked at it logically and you step back and you saw, well, okay, this 1% has all this money, but how much access to information is there? Oh, it's not totally transparent yet. Hm. Well, when it becomes transparent, these 99% are going to realize how these 1% got so much fucking money and they got to go, wow, you can't do that. And then everyone's going to agree. Yeah, they can't do that. Right? No, they can't do that. Jesus fucking Christ who let them do that. That's when there's 100% accountability when you're going to be able to beat you. Absolutely. Sure. What someone has and hasn't done. That's common.

Speaker 3:          00:47:24       You think so? I don't think they'll ever be that transparency where you can see that, I think workings of the

Speaker 1:          00:47:29       1% I think it's gonna. I think, I think they've got, they've mastered the game. They got, you know, the houses in Switzerland or wherever the fuck they live. And, but I think technology is the biggest fear to that. The big arrive on the building on a helicopter pad. You don't have to, you know, even being in an elevator with the underclasses, but what I'm saying is I don't think they're going to be able to maintain it anymore because like where's, where's your money? Where is it? Zero zero box so you can go to, no, it's all ones and Zeros. I'm computers now. Your money is essentially just a confidence game. It's like what do you have to you? The things that you bought with that money, but that money's just like set sitting somewhere like it's either in stacked in bills, which is equally brie weird. You do a bunch of notes and that's it. That's your mind. What happens to the burns need to have nothing. What did what, where's the value? Like what is this? You can't replace them. Say, Hey, I burnt my 1 million notes. Can you give me a new notes? You don't have them numbered off like a fucking hotel key that you lose. You don't have a scrooge duck room where you roll around and your gold coins.

Speaker 1:          00:48:36       If I was Joe Rogan perfect a room just a little bit, you know, just a couple of grand you could go roll around, make it rain on yourself. I think the more information comes out, the more access, the more control the average person has over their own domain, the less likely you're going to have 1% of the people with most of the wealth doesn't make any sense. Does it? Seems like that's not how the people would let it be. They'd figure out a way around that like that seems like that's obviously someone's exploited the system and they've made it a non unfair competition. Like this isn't like an even exchange anymore. You're getting this insane amount of revenue as opposed to the rest of the population. If you look at it like this massive group of bankers and Destria it's like well this is an insane amount of money.

Speaker 1:          00:49:24       There's only 50 you fuck heads. Like hold on and you all partied together and wife swap and you have fucking key parties and shit. They're like air force pilots. They're out. They're just flying until they run out of gas. Going full gangster. Making billions like that. Bernie Madoff cock sucker when they, within the snag that fighter pilots, they're like fucking full games runs out. They know that as soon as like there's some wiki leaks for the whole world and we as soon as everything like it's full 100% transparency and then ultimately voting on the Internet that's going to kill them all. One world government voting on the Internet, one when no government voting on the Internet, it's going to be where it's at because it's going to get to a point where people are going to realize that they're in in order to keep everybody from being crazy, there has to be a balance and until you bounce it out, people are going to be crazy because he's going to be an equity. You just going to be people that are eating fucking dirt sandwiches and then people that have thrown and half their food away because they're lazy and fat and they just take for granted that their foods at the store in the morning when they get up and I think that that until until you get that balance is out. There's always going to be some chaos. There's always that to like, and the

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       only way that's going to balance out is if everybody has free access to resources. It's like a non capitalist idea. It's a stupid idea because the reason why capitalism works is because it rewards effort and effort is what creates things. You know, the harder you work, the more reward you get, the more you become a baller. But the problem is a lot of those ballers they go, hmm, I like working but I don't like working this hard. How about if I just rig this thing? So it just continues to make me money even though it doesn't make any sense and no one's gonna say anything cause I'm the rich guy. Randy, you go and that's basically what the fuck happened. It has to be rectified. That has to be, we have to be put in a situation where our, our, the way we conduct our lives, whether it's finance or government or just behavior, the way we communicate with each other, it makes sense for the information that we have in front of us in 2013 and the fucking, the stock market does not make sense with the information that we have in front of us.

Speaker 2:          00:51:20       In 2013 it looks like a crazy chaotic ride. People screaming at each other on the floor and it's going up and down and a buzzer when rings off. You've got to stop the trades at a certain time like what the fuck are you doing? What are you doing? Hollering and writing shit down and throwing paper at each other and screen. What is the system? What do you, are you manipulating it or you're calling it as it happens? What's it based on? Is it based on anything tangible? Is it just confidence? Is it just, can you get a bad rumor out there and crash your stock and then everybody loses? What the fuck did you lose? What was out there. That's a

Speaker 3:          00:51:56       right and our whole system is tied to it. Guys have a bad day and we all go in the toilet and I know there's people like you don't understand the financial system. And that's their ignorance that you show on the show. It was disgusting. I'm so fucking tired of your pseudo science, right? You're right. You're right on all accounts. Wall Street always reminds me of the Middle East. It's always a bunch of unshaven assholes yelling at the top of their lungs.

Speaker 2:          00:52:18       I had some friends from back in Boston that went into stock markets. They went into doing that and it's uh, they were, they were savages, man. They were like crazy adrenaline junkie savages. And they wound up being the stock market guys. They wound up being, uh, being dudes on the floor screaming and yelling. What is it called? An agent. What is it called? What do they call them? A floor dude. What do they call the dorks? Traders know a trader. It's trader trader. The guys on the floor with the pets. It's crazy system. I don't understand it,

Speaker 3:          00:52:49       but where I lived around Wall Street, those, those a lot, a lot of little late night diary with bars all around and all this,

Speaker 2:          00:52:55       they're all down there. When I was there a system that that could be created where money made sense, where like the finances made sense. Where like, I guess like as soon as the company goes public, like just that alone, the ability to buy stock in a company and bank that the company does well, and if it does well your profit, if it doesn't go well, isn't that gambling? Is that, it seems like gambling to me. Right? Is it a kind of gambling? It kind of is. It is, right? Yeah. How come? Oh, hi. Is that legal? How can the stock market's like, didn't, okay. Like here, how about Bernie Madoff? Obviously what he did was illegal. Right? But like, why isn't that like,

Speaker 1:          00:53:33       do you think he's, do you think right now, every day he's gobbling balls with his asshole. Oh, he got balls. Certainly paid the word enough to, uh, you know, stakes to the guys who, uh, do you think he gets fucked? Oh, I think he's just getting pounded. You fucked a lot of people. A lot of people, a lot of really wealthy people. It's amazing. Like children, some like some like children's cancer fund or something. Some, a few really important charities and shit. Yeah, he had somebody in, it's connected in that jail then.

Speaker 2:          00:54:12       Oh yeah. Oh, I'm sure he's, he was a real sociopath to that guy. Apparently when they arrested him, he didn't fucking crack a sweat. Nothing like, Yep. All right, let's go. Like he knew it was coming and then when they tore apart his business and then realize that what he had done, he showed no remorse. He's like, I'm hungry. I need something to eat. You know? Like it was like, oh wow. He was not, he slept well. He never worried about those people in the, the, the kind of intense, intense fucking pain that he caused. All of those people, he stole money from you. They didn't give a fuck. Well, he was just a sociopath just done by this system. It's amazing. Then he pulled it off. That's what's amazing. What's amazing is that the system is so wonky that a guy can just pretend to have money and not really, and just fucking do this weird thing where you're

Speaker 1:          00:54:58       move shit around card Monte with millions of dollars with their money and look you're which now you're making more money. That's just incredible. I am making more money. The more money keep it and the more money you make, I'll just tell you that right now. Okay, I'm the fucking push it all in and so all of a sudden this asshole disappears on you or, or winds up on CNN and you're like, no, I, we were going to play tennis on Thursday. You know there had to be at least one dude who is suspicious. Like, man, I think this dude's a cruck. They had to be one dude. But

Speaker 2:          00:55:31       he was just getting those, those monthly checks and he's like, it looks good. Looks good here, looks good. Fuck. It's just looking at those numbers like, look, I'm making money. I mean just as long as I keep my money in play, I'm making money. I'm just going to honey, listen, if we push all of our life savings just together, we go in for two years as two out of 25% return rate, which was put up in getting and all of sudden CNN, that ugly cont walking across the floor of the courthouse and you'll like,

Speaker 1:          00:56:02       no, he stole it.

Speaker 2:          00:56:08       How can that guy get away with that? How has it, obviously he didn't get away with it, but how did he do it for so long? What kind of system do you have? This system is crazy. You need a new Gundam system. I agree. What to do, what to do, Tom Rhodes as a world traveler. What do, because you're the guy,

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       what do we do? You know, my thoughts are childish, man. I think, you know, the invention of pockets ruined everything. I think we were happy when we were just naked running around on the beach, just eating fruit and fucking, and then when somebody invented pockets, hi, I'm going to look at that shiny Shell and Oh look, a pretty rock. And then you start getting all these objects in your pocket and then you start trading with other people. And then like somebody invents, you know, paper money and Oh my God, then you know, I think you're right. Fucking pockets. Pockets ruined everything, man.

Speaker 2:          00:56:54       I think you're right. But I also think it's just the stage. We just have to get used to this, this, this level of existence. You just have to get used to it. And pocket tourist and he used to material, you have to get used to the managing your obsession with material objects, you know? But it could be managed. It's still better to have him. So way better. It happens.

Speaker 3:          00:57:13       That's what I like about traveling and not living anywhere is I accumulate a lot less shit. Oh yeah. I just don't buy it. I mean, I have my essentials, you know, and the things I have, they're the best, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:57:23       don't ever ha you don't have a home base. No. So you literally, you don't have a place where you recharge for a week.

Speaker 3:          00:57:31       No. And I, I get my mail sent somewhere, it said, uh, yeah. So you're just hoteling it everywhere you go. It depends where I'm at, you know? Um, uh, well my sister was going through cancer treatments that, you know, brought our family closer together and went to Florida more often. Uh, you know, last summer I did two months all over Europe and then I had a week off and rented an apartment in Rome. Oh. So, uh, and then last November I finished a a month in Asia and uh, me and my wife went to Bali for like two weeks. So it depends on where we're at. Well, like going to New Orleans a lot, like when to Austin a lot, you know, just do you book yourself? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:58:12       You do everything yourself now. Everything. Oh Wow. So you don't use an agent or anything? That's so smart art

Speaker 3:          00:58:18       at this point. Why wasn't, they didn't forge relationships with the international people? I mean, I went to those places so you know why he let some guys send an email and get 10%, you know, and then I've been doing my own stuff in the states for like the last five years. And do you try to do things other than stand up? He just kind of tried to concentrate on just trying to, you know, I, you know, I've, I've, I've got a podcast, I've, uh, I'm trying, I'm shooting videos all the time. I, you know, I was trying to sell this comedy travel show idea. Now I've heard, you know, some kind of things similar to that are being made and stuff. So, I don't know, I just, uh, I'm just, I'm just trying to make as much art as I can while I'm alive, you know, and just fucking jokes, videos, podcasts. I want to, uh, I've been, you know, writing for the Huffington posts, like travel stuff, but that, I want to get my, I've got a great stories. I mean, you know, the Puerto Rican honeypot, that's a good story, baby. So I'm going to get a book together, you know, I'm just, I'm just a one man comedy art machine and I'm just trying to fucking, you know, are you going to store your book in the,

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       but you going to have it on you at all times. You're gonna store it in the cloud. What do you mean on your computer? You know when you send things up to the cloud, cause I mean that's more appropriate. Your, your, your ideas should be out there on a server somewhere where you're roaming across where everybody can, the countryside. No, it's not an everybody can, they're password protected. Yeah, we did actually have a hard copy. Like some laptops, they don't have much storage on them. Like a lot of things people are storing. All right. They actually pulling things down from the cloud, which the problem with that is that you have to have an internet connection. No, and that's the thing I got, I got I, me and my wife, she's a photographer. We both have extra hard drives. We've got, you know, right. I got like three hard drives to travel with and just whip stuff on it. And you know that we're filming and recording and everything.

Speaker 5:          01:00:04       Before, before the big asteroid hit, everyone probably had their shit on the cloud and that's why I wouldn't try, I wouldn't trust putting something that's recipe for disaster. Yeah. I mean look papers,

Speaker 2:          01:00:15       pretty good recipe for disaster to, yeah. I mean even the, the oldest versions of the Bible, the Dead Sea Scrolls that were actually written on animal skins, like they, they, uh, that's like, they have like little pieces of shit. They try to piece together because it doesn't last. And that's, that's the only like four or 5,000 years old or 4,000 something around there. I think maybe even a little older. But that mean, think about how long, how long would a book lasts? Probably wouldn't even last as long as a piece of leather, you know, a piece of leather that you're writing on probably last longer than the book does. So like, I mean, how many, you know, how many years would a book last? We got to go back to rock and what the fuck are you going to do with little tiny, you know, SD cards, you know, you've got an SD card and that's where you're storing all your shit. You know, like what does, who's going in the future? They're going to find that guy. What the fuck is this?

Speaker 5:          01:01:02       Yeah. Well, I wonder what that is now for us. Like arrowheads were like what the fuck is that? Imagine if it was like some Avatar Shit.

Speaker 2:          01:01:10       Not only was it an arrowhead, it was also like you put it on the right stone and it would glow and you'd get tuned into her mother Gaia

Speaker 5:          01:01:19       and most arrowheads just had porn on it. Terror attack cause getting fucked by chicks. That movie Avatar was so

Speaker 2:          01:01:26       that movie Avatar was so fascinating to me. Not just because I loved the movie but because of all those people that got avatar depression. Oh yeah. Live in up in the thing. No the people, the people who watched it, they got an Avatar depression cause they wish their life was as noble and real as the Navi. Wow. Yeah. It was really fascinating because it was like a condition that was like getting repeatedly diagnosed. They were calling an avatar depression half tongue and cheek, but in half not,

Speaker 5:          01:01:54       I think that's just a brilliant marketing move for the Blue Ray release Avatar. You might be right. Yeah. That's probably driving marketing bullshit. Oh

Speaker 2:          01:02:02       well as far as like a overcoming like obvious fakes on the Internet, he's like the master at spotting bullshit on the Internet. I'd never met anybody who's got, I don't think we're ever write any of its river right all the time. But you are like as far as like videos or pictures, you're like 99%

Speaker 5:          01:02:21       well you know what I've been finding out a lot lately is a new one and I don't know if this is mostly probably just based in Los Angeles, but there's these guys that go to parties that act like normal people, but they have to do something like, all right. I'm like, I know somebody that got fired game. Yeah, I know some of that got hired to go. All right, you're a meth head and you need to go to the bathroom like every five minutes and just make it be obvious at the party and you just kind of be normal. But just kind of like the big be sweaty and stuff like they just invite like situations to parties like this. So it's like a Gig for actors. It's good for actors. Yeah. That's good.

Speaker 2:          01:02:55       Could you imagine you have a party and some asshole hires a comic or an actor to come over and pretend that he's a method and it keeps like slamming your bathroom door and putting on a show and he's actually getting paid to do that.

Speaker 5:          01:03:09       But you know the guy and he's done a really good actor and halfway through minutes and you're like, what are you doing man? I take, cause you gotta sell the scene. You've got to say you to believe it. You've got to believe her. The message,

Speaker 2:          01:03:20       you're not doing math right now man. You're not, I don't know if I'm crazy. No, no you're not.

Speaker 5:          01:03:28       There was also a, he a guy that does like overly gay at party where he's just super, super gay and he's a real gay guy but he does overly gay and they really, they rent them out. It's just a spice up parties cause you're not like some parties are just like, we're all just people who don't have comedy and I'm to do things like they need to, they need to hire colorful characters in real life.

Speaker 2:          01:03:49       It's hard to find good conversation out there in America. It's hard. You know, you could look upon the wrong fucking little little corner of the world and be stuck on this little circular. What are those things called? At the end of driveways, the end of a road called the sac, you can be caught to call the sack with two boring motherfuckers and they just, I was cotton called a sack with two dummies to dummies in one really nice guy who was strange but to just straight dummies. I just kind of what a dog. Okay. And his dog was like this creepy dog. It was always out. He didn't really have a fence. He had a sort of little fence, but there was a hill so the dog could go up the hill and around the fence there was no fence was bullshit, you know? And his dog was creepy.

Speaker 2:          01:04:27       Like you'd go out of the dog, would growl at you and shit. And he bit bit somebody who was over the guy's house. It was painting. And so I love dogs. I mean, I fucking love dogs. I've had dogs my whole life. So when I think a dog, it's creepy. It's because I know it's erratic. You know it's not, I have a deep love for dogs. So I, I went to this dude's house and I'm like, Hey, I'm, I go the dog. I go, he's, he's not just getting out, man. I go, he's like really being aggressive and he's ground, like maybe want like want to look into this? And so he goes, yeah, your, your dog got out and attack me. He just makes up a story about my dog getting out and attacking him. I'm like, yeah, are you okay? Like what happened?

Speaker 2:          01:05:05       Many times nine, he was 90 pounds a night at 90 pound dog, the ones to attack it was a pit bull that wants to attack you. That's not going to, you're not going to survive that. And if you do survive that, you're going to be horribly torn apart me and might be able to get to a fence and shut it. Well, I don't think he's going to let go. I think he's gonna just tear you apart. I really don't see you survive in that. So when you, you're a fat guy who smoked cigarettes and you're telling me my dog attacked you and you held him down by his neck. This guy was telling me, I held him down by his Nafta, Tali, calm down. I go, oh, he calmed down. Would that take a year? You can not hold a pit bull down by the neck and they're going to calm down.

Speaker 2:          01:05:40       Do you know anything about dogs? You out of your fucking mind? Like this is the dumbest story ever. But I got sad because I was like, this guy is, this is his reality. His reality is instead of dealing with these problems and they're like going, hey, you know, we've got to put this crazy dog down. Let's talk. It's going to bite somebody. It's dogs. Creepy sounds wrong with our dog. Instead of that, he's just putting blinders on and making up stories. And that's, you could, you could be that guy. You could be putting blinders on and making up stories. Anybody can be that guy. Make up your reality as it's going little bit. So that was my fucking neighbor and I'd see that fucking dummy every day and you'd ask me stupid questions about stupid shit.

Speaker 5:          01:06:19       That's why you never talked to your neighbors, man. I do not follow those rules. I live next to the golf fencer guys that go to it, like renaissance festivals and, and like, they seem like nice people, but I don't want to go in that world. I don't want them to now like knock on my door went and just like, Hey, what do you do in Brian? I don't want any of that. I don't want any conversations with anybody.

Speaker 2:          01:06:38       Yeah. I moved into my house 10 years ago when my neighbor, like the moment I moved in, they started sending these notices that they wanted me to cut my trees down. They wanted me to cut my tree so that they could see like some lights in the distance, you know, from behind. You know, like we're, I guess if you see through my trees you could see some lights. They wanted me to chop the trees down. Like, like just right when I move in. Not, not. Here's a cupcake that my wife baked. Welcome to the neighborhood. You know, hey, we're going to be sharing space together on this plan and I'd like to shake your hand and say, you know, and you ever need to borrow a cup of sugar. I'm right over here. Yeah, that would be nice. Right now instead of this Dickhead, once it bring me in front of some homeowners association of a reason why, one of the reasons why I bought the house is the beautiful trees. I love trees. Chop them down so he could see the lights.

Speaker 5:          01:07:31       No. When I do finally find where I want to live, there ain't going to be no homeowners association. All everything. Homeowner's associations are always assholes. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:07:41       They tried to tell my friend that he couldn't put a solar up in his yard and he was like, why can't I put solar up in my yard? And they, you know, they say like, oh, it's on slightly in this thing, but there's a California state law. It says that homeowner's associations can not stop you from putting up solar power if you're, if you're a smart person, you have the shackles, which I'm not smart because I haven't done it, but you're, if you're not like having your house hooked up solar in California, this is the greatest resource we have. We're so low on resources here except for sunlight, sunlight. We have a massive abundance of it and you can power your whole fucking easy peasy with, with solar in this country or in this state, rather. It's so easy. You know, if you're in Seattle, it's going to be a bitch.

Speaker 2:          01:08:23       But you know what I found when you're in Seattle, we were in the fucking woods man, and this dude had solar panels on the roof of his car and it's raining and it's gloomy and drew this. This solar panels still pull solar power. Even when it's gloomy. Even in Seattle, they're still pulling and charging is batteries and he was watching TV. It's fucking crazy awesome at some, I mean that that's, we've been hoodwinked, you know, into thinking that that's not a good way to get your energy. Especially around here. It's the best way to get your energy.

Speaker 3:          01:08:57       I had a pot growing friends who used to live in Ukiah. Ukiah is amazing. It's like an hour north of San Francisco. Woo. Mendocino county looks like Switzerland up there. Beautiful Hasan. And uh, this guy loved, we'd so much, he had his own pot farm, but he, uh, you know, the DEA would, they look for big patches. He, he would plan them in little bunches along tree lines and he, he loved, we'd so much he got out there with a shovel and Doug put in a sprinkler system or it was timed and you know, and he was totally living off the grid. He had, um, you know, big things that caught rainwater. He, you know, whatever. And then he had solar panels on his roof. Guy Who completely lived off the grid and everything. Wow. And uh, he had a heart attack and died like two years ago out there.

Speaker 6:          01:09:45       Yeah. Good.

Speaker 2:          01:09:47       That's a good way to go. Well, yeah, I mean, I miss, yeah, I mean, he was living off the grid, living like a man collecting rain water. And you know what I mean? If you're going to go out there in the wilderness where it's beautiful and you're with nature and you pass on to the next dimension, that's, that's a good way to do it.

Speaker 3:          01:10:04       Good. Okay. I would selfishly missed my friend and when I visited him, he'd give me like a pound of weed and I would drive back to Los Angeles with my cruise control set on 54

Speaker 2:          01:10:17       I'm going 54 right. So terrifying. We've got weed in your car and your dry. Oh, it's a terrifying feeling. And we're so, it's so lax here in California. I have friends that live in California, but then they do gigs other places and they'll forget like if you get busted with weed in Texas, right. They arrested Willie Nelson. Right. You know Willie fucking nails. They're state icon. Yeah. Got, might as well be your grandfather. You're going to rest your grandfather because he likes to get high. Wow. That's the dumbest Shit I've ever heard. That's the dumbest use of serve and protect ever. But he's fucking crazy that Willie, he's out there smoke who might write some more great songs, be out there playing that guitar and that was fucking hippies.

Speaker 3:          01:11:02       But Willie's Auntie, all other drugs, the people that work for him, uh, there's the saying among people that work for willy, if you're wired, you're fired. Wow, that's me. He doesn't tolerate any chemicals and shit. He's, he's a weed guy.

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       But those type of like speed dudes are a nightmare. Speed people are a nightmare, right? Be especially because their, their sense of judgment gets whacked out. That's one of the reasons why they get caught. They caught this guy who was a lawyer, it was in Esquire or Gq, one of those manly men magazines where it's okay to read it. And uh, this dude was a lawyer and then, uh, he did something with meth and uh, maybe it was like based on a client that he was working with, taught him how to make math. And then the guy just was making buckets of it in his basement. He just seems like it's, he was nuts. And you know, the cops eventually came over his house and funnel it was meth and his basement. They're like, why was he, he's acting so crazy. Like everybody knew something had to be going on. Like the guy had zero, like his, his ability to make judgment calls was gone. So you would never know.

Speaker 3:          01:11:59       I want to come with her ass four in the morning. Things like that.

Speaker 2:          01:12:02       If you're an old hippie Willie Nelson, whether your gray ponytail and you sitting out there and trying to write a song and you've got this dude working for you and he's bouncing off the fucking walls, climbing trees and shit, you know, it's a nightmare. That would be, yeah, that's some Zombie Shit. Math methods and scary. Have you ever known anybody,

Speaker 3:          01:12:22       uh, older people that had kicked it and told me that they had done it? Uh, no, no, it's, it's, yeah, that's, I knew a few people really. That seems, that seems nasty. And then, yeah, it's just funny when you travel around America in the rural areas, on the side of barns, there's advertised, you know like meth destroys families and lives and like, and even like above gas pumps, like you'd drive to the middle of America. There's just these, so apparently middle American,

Speaker 2:          01:12:50       it's just meth. Crazy. There's a real problem with rural areas where there's nothing to do. Yup. Let's stay up all night. I think it's one of those channels learning language, play chess. I think it's, I think it's one of those trends you can be doing. It's really hard to let go. I think once it gets yet it's Gotcha. Again, I need some of their like real physical detoxification and going, I need to give you an [inaudible]. Make sure you're not dehydrated or like he, you could, you could get, your body gets wrecked cause he just red lining

Speaker 3:          01:13:21       Ge.

Speaker 2:          01:13:23       So when you finally get off of your body's just like, oh my God, he just barked it, cooked it. You ever met anybody that used to do like wasn't into math and then started doing math? Uh, no. I've met a couple of evil and they lose like a good percentage of their ability to like be a normal person. They didn't miss a chunk and they're always going to be a little wacky, just a little wacky. Some dudes get through it fine. There's a few MMA fighters that had math problems and then had like real issues with it and then like almost died and then became an incredibly disciplined because they had like been to the edge and pulling themselves out of that and then recognizing that they have a problem and they'd be turning their ass around beat dragon completely. So now they resolved and like never be defeated again.

Speaker 2:          01:14:15       It's like some of the toughest guys in the, in a MMA or like that, there's a few guys and had like court McGee who was a, who won the ultimate fighter. He had a like real substance abuse problem. He was actually brought back. He was resuscitated. Wow. Yeah. Even when was the last time you ever heard about that? From weed due date of pot, Brownie and died, you know. No, but we it just accept that a certain amount of penny guy hit a pot brownie and really enjoyed Spiderman. Three the best sex ever. If you haven't fucked on pot cookies or pot Annabelle's, you're, you really don't even know what sex feels like. It's, it's like the same thing between eating an ice cream Sundae high and eating an ice cream sundae sober. Such a completely different experience. Like completely, totally different. But, but sex and pot cookies just cranks the whole thing up. Walk every, every sense. Just firing, crackle, Wacko, cold and you're freaking out. Can you believe you're alive? You're weirded out by sex in the first place. Then we make an a baby. What's going on here?

Speaker 7:          01:15:30       Wow.

Speaker 2:          01:15:31       Crackle. You were a, um, a talk show host in Amsterdam when everything was illegal here, but everything was legal there. What the fuck was that like? I cried myself to sleep every night. It was terrible. Jeff, you know, Tom and I have been friends for a long time when we first I knew about you, but I didn't meet you until we did a thing. Um, in New York when we were both on TV at the same time. You had the time roadshow and I had that news radio thing, but it was like right away I can tell you were like, oh real comic like right. We had it like a few, we had a few words back and forth and back and forth. I'm like this mother, this is a real comic. And then after the show a, you know, a couple of years later, hey here, Tom Rhodes is doing a fucking talk show over in Holland in Amsterdam and he's not even doing it as Tom Rhodes. He's like playing a character and we're like, that sounds like Tom rose. That sounds like something Tom Rhodes. We do just fucking out there doing it. Just out there gangster style. It was awesome. And I was like one of the best experiences in my life. What was it called again?

Speaker 3:          01:16:39       Well it was the Kevin Masters show at first and nobody, they didn't any magazine newspaper interview I did. They would say, well why is it Kevin Masters who's Kevin Masters? And I would always say, I don't know that they, um, they came up with the idea, we're going to get an American and we're going to do this like American late night talk show and we're going to call him Kevin Masters. So

Speaker 2:          01:17:02       did they ask you to stick with that name?

Speaker 3:          01:17:04       No. Well no, because then I never went along with it. I would never, whenever anybody would say Kevin, I would say name is Tom. I never, I, yeah, I spent my whole career trying to establish my name. I'm not gonna fucking, that's like, so it was silly. So then, uh, seasons two and three, it was Kevin Masters starring Tom Rhodes. Oh, that's nice. So at least they gave me the star or anything, but it was, it was, you know, once in a lifetime experience, um, there would be like for this girl, this love story, and I was playing in Europe a lot, primarily London. I was flying back and forth to London, um, every other weekend and all the gigs all over Europe. And, uh, it didn't work out with this girl, but I had fallen in love with Holland and Europe and I got this amazing television, you know, do you want to stay and, and post your own show.

Speaker 3:          01:17:54       And I grew up watching Carson and Letterman and you know, to be that guy coming out from behind the curtain in the $3,000 suit and then you stand on the x and you get to do your little five minute monologue. And then you walked to the desk and you banter with your musical hosts, which I had one little hip hop guy named [inaudible] life. And then, you know, and then you'd do a skit and then he could be a, you know, you do a skit. And then first guest. Uh, and then my favorite part of the show, every episode I would get to make a five minute film where I would experience something of Dutch culture. Uh, one day I spent on a Dutch farm with a farmer and I walked into an electric fence. He said, look out for the electric fence in Dutch, but I don't speak Dutch.

Speaker 3:          01:18:37       So you know, seeing like somebody get electrocuted. This hilarious. How, how does, uh, it, it's, it's, it's not that bad. Can I cook a Dick off? No, but it makes you jump like a Mofo. I heard a good luck. Literally Cook Your Dick off. So I'm like, I got it. I got a tour of the, you know, the red light district and the uh, sex laws were explained to me that I was given a tour of Gay Amsterdam by the guy that does the gay parade. Uh, I got to cover the, uh, the prime minister debates the lice strikers as bots. And I was on the floor with a press badge and a microphone and I'm talking to their most powerful, there are most important political leaders where like, I couldn't even meet the governor of my stake. And then in the United States. Yeah. Unless you were lucky you were standing next to him.

Speaker 3:          01:19:22       Really cool moments. You know, tenacious d came over and I filmed a great one of the eye that, that five minute film, I gave them a tour of Amsterdam that's on youtube. I'll be showing tenacious d around. You know what else on Youtube? There's a video. I think it's on live leak. Actually, Brian, tell me if this is real. These two dudes, they piss on an electric fence and we both get electrocuted at the same time. Have you seen it? Yeah, that's totally real. Pulled out of think. It's funny watching a dude walk into an electric fence. Check out what it looks like when two dudes past tense at the same time. That's shit hurts. So bad touching. Oh it is is ridiculous. It's hilarious. Wow. I didn't know what would happen. I wonder. I wonder if it Dick's are okay. Probably not right. I imagine the amount of force that goes through your cock. I wouldn't even chance that one.

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       If it makes your Dick numb forever. You shouldn't do things that like tamper with the performance of your, nope. That's what I'm talking about. Don't let us on an electric fence. Tattoos. No piercings. Snowed Jack pillows. Yeah. Those dudes that split their Dick. That's Ooh. Oh my God. It looks like one of those hot dogs he put on a Weber microwave, microwave the microwave. I thought he's just explode. It's when you split them, you know you split people like, like hot dogs, sandwiches. Like that was more like of a back east sort of a thing. You know you'd get okay, here it is. Watch this stupid fucks. They both get out. Oh, I go to Paris on something. Do you just have to go somewhere in Piss? You ever noticed that when they piss they don't just, they don't just like pull their pants down and piss on the ground.

Speaker 1:          01:20:52       They have to find something that way. It's a male thing. Totally. Yeah. This is a military fence too, so I'm sure pop, oh, oh my God. Oh my God. That's the only one guy. There's another one with see writes in his stream. Hits the electrical. That's a faint. He fell like the tree. Felling a tree. Hey Man, what the fuck makes people faint? It was having this conversation the other day with a friend. What? What did, what is it that makes people faint? Yeah. Any idea? The Beatles. Elvis is what is the mechanism I use? It's supposed to protect you from something like what do you, why does, why do people think, um, well, goats, the fainting goats, I don't know if you know about those citizens guts where I think is used as a, uh, as what you just said, defense mechanism, defense mechanism, but kind of defense mechanism.

Speaker 1:          01:21:44       I think it's something to like maybe blood running too fast too. You know, your heart or something like, you know what I mean? Like it might be something like that. It was like if someone was trying to eat you and you just fall down and play dead, that's a terrible strategy. But what the fuck do I know? You know why he didn't want to made the platypus nature where I had to get who? What guy were you talking to about fainting with? Oh, what was he making you? A girl that I dated a long time ago had a real problem with needles, um, where she would see her in a movie and she would just pass out. And I was like, I was like trying to figure, I go to something happened to you. Like what? You know, like what was well, no, she apparently when she was young she had some sort of a really bad infection and they had to give her a bunch of shots, like a bunch of shots and apparently it, it just hurt like hell and it just traumatized her.

Speaker 1:          01:22:35       But then she told me that her dad was a doctor and her dad would faint. Oh, her dad, he was a dentist actually, but he would faint. Like he would see his son, his son had like blisters on his face because he, uh, he was out in the sun. That sunburn. He was sunburned, so bad that he started getting like these little blisters on his face. The father saw and just falls down and passes out. Like, wow, what kind of, that'd be hard to be a dentist and not be able to give a shot. I guess it's, it has to do with it. His son

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       and he couldn't take it because it was his kid. And you know, the love that he has for his boy and he sees him hurt and damaged the freaks out and just like this is too much and just completely checks out.

Speaker 3:          01:23:16       Hmm. Um, I want to give a shout out to my dentist, Dr Pelerin. Uh, the man just retired. He's been our little family dentist and are in Florida for years. Oh, that's great. This guy could give a shot. Oh my God. Ain't got slay a artist. Just an artist. The way it didn't hurt. And now there's a person who's replaced him ruthless as good. Not as good. It's a Jab, right? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:23:41       It's fucking terrible. Abby, with that fucking needle. Gee, did you see this shit about these as a storm chasers, the cotton, that hurricane or the tornado rather? I think I saw something for flash second there. Those dudes that were on that show, storm chasers. Oh, they killed when they got killed by a tornado. Wow. The, uh, let's kind of, Steve Irwin, isn't it? A little bit, but no, because what these guys were doing was measuring the, the velocity of the wind and how far it tastes like they were, they were recording data that how she to do this. Yes and no. I mean I think you have to, you got to be right up on it now with his litmus to register like the speed of the wind and shit like that. I think like, it varies in, you know, like where are wherever you are from close to far. And I think they make those calculations based on a lot of data that they take in the field. As far as I know, there's a great benefit to doing it like that. Wow.

Speaker 3:          01:24:35       That Oklahoma City, that was amazing. I was in New Zealand where that happened and it just like, you know, Eh, uh, as the story was unfolding, it's amazing how, you know, news goes around the world instantly, but you know, you'd like a mile wide path ripping through the city. Just the devastation. It's any time. Do you remember Joplin, Missouri? Oh yeah. God, that one we got wiped out. It's like literally didn't exist anymore. Right. It's, it's, and if you look at it, it was an older town too. I had passed through. I used to, when I did the road, I drove through Joplin a few times, like a

Speaker 2:          01:25:04       brush, like a mile wide brush, just just like a big horse hair brush. Just scrubbed it right off the face of the world. It's just, it's an incredible thing that the wind in under certain conditions can reach that kind of a frenzy. You know? It's really, it's, it's, it's, it's so shocking. Like our, our calm world that we live in for the most part is, uh, it's, it's so different than what happens with the fucking door dado comes, it's just so hard for us to wrap our heads around it. Fuck. Tornadoes do, did you ever see, do you ever see the one from Dallas or it's throwing semis in the air? Semis are spinning around in a circle like leaves. Wow. It's insane. They're just flying through the air 18 wheelers just flying through the air. It's throwing around trucks. It doesn't even drop him. It's just spinning them around. It's like a goddamn movie like that, that twist her movie. Twister,

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       twister. What's her name? Uh, at a wet t shirt on the scene. Helen Hunt. That was, that was it. That's the thing about New Zealand that I really enjoyed. They go really, uh, there's a nice filter of, of, of negative, of negative news. They don't, they don't get in New Zealand. Um, they don't like the Middle East doesn't even exist in their news. You don't, you don't hear any stories about Syria, Israel, um, you know, in the United States it's always shootings and bombings and disasters in New Zealand. The newspaper is like a sheep gotten the road. Will you interview, you know, very calm. We do there. We interviewed them in person. Yes. I want to meet that guy. He's a fascinating guy. He would love the guy and a, you should hear it. You should listen to the conversation I did with him. He's really articulate. Oh, brilliant. And the guy's really funny too.

Speaker 3:          01:26:55       He's, he's uh, he's got a great sense of humor. Um, it was remarkable. I did the, uh, NPR of New Zealand, Radio New Zealand. And the woman asked me, you know, what would you like to do while you're in New Zealand? And I said, I'd like to meet kim.com and a few hours later he followed me back on Twitter and I looked at his Twitter thing and, uh, he had an email and I sent him a nice email and said, I'd like to do chat, which I think is really fascinating guy. And he's really portrayed in the American media is a site kind of, you know, bond, villain, you know, uh, you know, bad person. But I think the guy manipulated the strengths of the tools he was working with when the Internet came on. And he's the reason a lot of rules were put into place. He, you know what, he totally straightened me out because I had the misconception that I thought the website mega upload did, he made all the money from, I thought, oh, that's like the Napster of movies or something.

Speaker 3:          01:27:54       You know, I'd never used it. I didn't know what it was. Um, and he, he corrected me. He said, no, they never had a search engine thing. You couldn't type in Avatar and find Avatar, whereas the, the Napster, you could stretch search in Metallica Zeplin and I'd get all this stuff. So they never had that. It was people sharing files, like kind of Dropbox or something, you know, and he didn't, you know, know what was, uh, people were, were, were, were trading or sharing it and a, it, he's a fascinating guy, man. I sent him an email, he invites me to his mansion and, uh, it was on the last day I was there. So, uh, you know, I was from, from his house to the airport. I only got to talk to him for an hour, but just wonderful man invites me into his home and just, you know, uh, [inaudible] the guy is, he's, I think he's kind of like an Internet visionary.

Speaker 3:          01:28:47       He's got a lot of great thoughts about, um, where the Internet is going and, and, and then, you know, in the United States is trying to extradite him other than really, yeah. And it's a charge piracy, I guess if it's, he had like the best DVR ever. Like, Hey, do you want to watch like all these homemade porns from every single person that's ever uploaded this mega upload, which is what I was only there an hour. I didn't, I didn't get to see the upstairs. Those aren't going to be good. They're going to be fat dudes with their tongue out of their car right in front of the Lens. That's what we're going to see if you tuned into people's, no, no, no, no. He's sick. He's got you guys got a beautiful wife. He's got like five kids. He's a Gamer man. The Guy Loves Games and I bet you guys great movies, Huh? Uh, I was a fan of his

Speaker 2:          01:29:28       way back in the day. He had a really cool website. He was like one of the first guys that had like this really like high level personal website and it was all like, he had an animated feature where I think it was Milosevic. Is it? Who's the, the evil guy? Most of it. Yeah. I think it was him that he was, he was killing in his, uh, in his, our cartoon that he had on his website. Like if it was like all flash animated, like really bad ass it called, I forget strong battery. It was kim.com even find it. I don't even know if he was calling himself Kim Dotcom back then. I think it was, he was just calling himself Kim.

Speaker 8:          01:30:07       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:30:07       But uh, he, his website was like genius. It was like really high level shit. My friend Andrew turned me onto it and he was like, you gotta look at this guy's website. Like this guy's website is on another level. And I went to, and I was like, whoa.

Speaker 3:          01:30:18       Right. He was on top of the Internet game from the beginning.

Speaker 2:          01:30:20       This is like late nineties, I think. Maybe. Yeah, maybe 2000 at the most. So it was a fascinating fucking website back then. So this guy is like being at the front line or the Internet for a long ass time. That was when he was doing like hacker. He was a hacker and then he went into security and he was doing like security for big companies.

Speaker 3:          01:30:41       That's what he said. He got busted and then he got hired by like 18. His fist story's fascinating. Right. You know, uh, the only thing I didn't get to ask him was, who do you want to play you in the movie? Um, they, he was a hacker from first and then he got a good call. Uh, and then he got hired by at and t and all these companies to, for him to explain, you know, the workings of their system and how someone could get in. I mean, yeah, I would imagine you need that if you're a fucking bank, right? Yeah. A little. That's what's amazing. That they allow you to, yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:31:10       Bank online, but you can vote online. That's, that's hilarious. It's a, it's too dangerous and ensure the veracity of this transmission to dangerous voting online folding is too important, but your money, this is more convenient.

Speaker 3:          01:31:26       Hmm. I can't find anything about it as early cartoons stuff. Anyway, I had a, I had a great conversation with him for an hour and he's very generous for him to do that. And the guy loves comedy pull up versus Malosha Vich uh, I don't even know how to spell that. And uh, you know, I, I found him very humorous and a a good dude. I enjoy looking at him in his eyes and, and uh, asking him whatever I felt like. What do think

Speaker 2:          01:31:50       the argument is? Do you think the argument is that people should be able to share files and then if you buy something, you should be able to put online and other people she will to pull it down if they want it and upload something that

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       they bought. But as long as someone's buying the original thing and uploading it, then it's not theft. That's what a lot of people feel and a lot of people feel like as long as I'm not actually taking,

Speaker 3:          01:32:09       if it was paid for once, Sherry, well, yeah, I don't know. I think they, you know, they're going to limit it as much as they possibly can, but I don't think they'll ever to, you know, with Dropbox and all these different technologies, it'd be impossible to, to totally stop it. Yeah. But what I'm asking is like, what is his argument? Like, what is it, you know, guys and get I give you, you, you're my, I leave you my iPod with my fucking massive music collection. You know, it's supposed to take, I'm supposed to like say no, I'm gonna give this back to the RCA. God roads paid for all these songs. Well, I didn't know he liked, yeah. Fancy client or whatever. Man, I'm fucking rock that Patsy Cline. But yeah, like who's the center? Right. Which is to say what happens to it after you, but I don't, they'll never be able to control that for everything being paid for.

Speaker 3:          01:32:52       What does kim.com, uh, argument, like does he think that things should be that way? That you should be able to [inaudible] you know, and uh, this is me speaking, I think, you know, he did. He's the reason a lot of rules were put into place. So, you know, and, and now he's his, his, his website. And when it, you know, he's complying with a business. It's kind of like in New Zealand, they feel like the guys kind of, uh, being persecuted by the American government. He thinks like the Hollywood studios that backed Obama's campaign, uh, they're the ones that wanted, you know, perpetuate this and have him extradited and face charges. And he's, you know, and if he is made an example of then other, you know, Internet, you know, hacker or whatever, people, it sends a message to those people, you know, that makes sense. I mean,

Speaker 1:          01:33:44       they definitely do that with entertainers that get caught. We're not paying their taxes. Like, like blade, they put him in jail. They put Wesley Snipes and Jeff for three fucking years. You know, he was trying to pay it back. They're like, yeah, no, I mean, he couldn't even, they didn't even say, hey, you owe us money and since you lost in court, now you have to pay it plus a fine. They're like, no, we're going to take your freedom publicly for three years and lock you in a cage as you're, you know, nearing your early fifties. It's not going to be so fun. And then when you get out, we'd like all that money back please. Then when you get out, you've got to claw your way back. Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:34:22       And then he's a little aged as an actor. You know what they would he do that so long that he's putting on plays in the jail. He might lose his chops a little bit. Staying Sharp, but you should listen to my, uh, my podcast with him.com. How do I get it? Is it iTunes? Tom Rhodes radio, Tom Rhodes radio. Why'd you choose that name? Because I thought I could play whatever I wanted and I'd take like sound clips from movies and like, and when I talked with Comedians, um, I'll, I'll put little snippets of their standup in there and stuff. Do you going to run into problems doing that? I know and I've tried it. I don't have any commercials. It's free. Hmm. Okay. So, uh, free. Uh, so, so does that not work ladder. And that's what I did at the beginning and that's why I call it tomorrow it's radio.

Speaker 3:          01:35:06       But now I don't do movie clips or anything. I'll just, I'll take some stand up. Um, you know, if somebody didn't know, uh, Hedberg Hedberg or something, he comes up in conversation. Perfect example, you know, to do a little sliver of a couple of his jokes. So it's just, I kind of approach it like if I was a, I'm a university professor teaching a master class in comedy, you know, it's, it's, it's a lot of Comedians, but a lot of also interesting people do. People I admire, you know, like I admired Kim Dotcom. I, I sent him a message, I got in touch with them. Do you edit it all yourself? Uh, my wife helps me. She edits it. What do you use to put everything together? What's the like pro tools? What do you use? Oh, just garageband. Garageband said it all together. Great. Anybody can do, you can be your own Internet mogul now you've got the technology. You don't have to,

Speaker 1:          01:35:58       that's the video. This is from, I mean, I want to say like it work, right? You can't be any later than 2000 used to call himself Kim there. It was just Kim expert Kim. I don't know what his actual real name is. Kim Schmidt, but this is a him. He was something like that. He's like a character.

Speaker 3:          01:36:18       God. He makes, he makes rap songs and dance songs. That's the mega car that Ma, how you knew what it was.

Speaker 1:          01:36:26       Yeah, I remember this. I remember this well. He had a whole thing. Yeah. Like the guy gets out, he gets on a speed boat. He's just letting you know he's a bad motherfucker. He takes his crash car to leave a faster boat. Now I'm gone, bitch, push. I'm like James Bond up in this motherfucker. So he's a flying around on the water in his boat and he presses the eject button. So this was his, I guess his obsession with all things mega. Yeah. Look, any lands on the bottom of this helicopter. Then he lands on a building. Microsoft, Microsoft was having sex with the building. It's sliding down the building, built. He's Bill Gates. He's going to shoot Bill Gates.

Speaker 3:          01:37:10       What a great idea. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. It guns down. Bill Gates. Bill Gates. That's brutal to him. It says this is, this is for winners. Me. So Bill Gates

Speaker 1:          01:37:28       peeing on the ground and it turns out he didn't actually shoot him, but he shot around him. The word Linux you lane. And that's so funny. That's not the one that I saw. I saw it.

Speaker 3:          01:37:41       I'm glad he didn't kill Bill Gates. Yeah, I thought he was killing it was like that was really twisted. Yeah, he's, he does. These were all long time ago. This was like, there was nothing like that on the Internet. People weren't doing it on their own website. It's really strange. Right.

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       Anyway, yeah. Do you, uh, what do you do your, um, you, you just edit it all yourself and put it live or put it up on iTunes but you don't do like a lot Ustream version or anything like that? The cloud and uh, but I'm going to Ustream version, like the video,

Speaker 3:          01:38:12       little snippets of video and put it on Youtube. I, my youtube channel is King of ha ha king of [inaudible] and a, it sounds like a middle man help ones. Uh, and I, I didn't, I didn't film Kim got calm. I felt so privileged to be in the guy's house when I got there. I was enjoying just meeting the guy so much. I know. I actually said, we don't need to do this, bro. I'm just happy to meet you. Right. And I actually, you know, I was just so glad to be sitting there and talking to the guy and then he said, no, no, no. You know, um, you know, please, you know, if you want to, if you want to record

Speaker 2:          01:38:44       the act of doing a podcast makes conversations happen that might not necessarily how, how like, like you and I, okay, we might go have dinner somewhere, but I might, you know, take a phone call. You might go to take a leak, you know, we're not going to sit down for three hours and just drink coffee and smoke a little weed and just talk like this. Like, it's almost like you need this vehicle, uh, putting on a show to, to, to get it out there, you know? Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:39:08       It's cool. But my, my, my wife also achieved, she's, she films a lot. I've filmed a lot, so we ain't got great stuff with Stan hope and um, Steve, uh, yeah. Um, they're coming out a little faster now.

Speaker 2:          01:39:20       I've got a lot of backed up episodes. What's it man? It's, that's the beautiful thing about podcasts. All you really need, if you want to do an audio podcast, especially, you just need an iPhone and you can do, I've, we've done ones where Brian, what kind of a editing did you have to do? When I did those podcasts on the plans? Did you have to do anything to it? No, I just cut off that beginning and end and just, it's amazing. And then put commercials on the sound of the plane wasn't a, Oh, it's Kinda cool. It's Kinda cool. It's in the background, you know? And then, you know, like what I do is I'd hold the iPhone between like me and Joey are me and Dunkin and me and Ari or Brian. And did we ever do one Bryan's never do podcast on the planet. We should have that like a regular episode when we do gigs. Do podcasts on a plane. Absolutely. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:40:01       I did it. I did the Austin Moontower festival. Was that a comedy festival? Yeah, it's great. It's an Austin. I just a second year and uh, I love Ari. He's awesome. Oh my God. Just his face makes me happy. I enjoy dead guys. I enjoy his company so much. And I did it. I sat down and then it was having a great conversation with him for my podcast and then Marin walks out cause we were on these balconies at the hotel and then Marin sits down and then it's, you know, it comes all about all about marriage, but there's, I've got great video. It did, it really, that is really what happened was, but Marin's great. And the thing, cause I was having this great, I didn't know he had been like Orthodox and that he had lived in Israel and stuff. So I'm like story, I'm asking him all these things that like, I just, I, you know, what's the squiggly, uh, sideburns mean? What's the Tassel on the pants thing mean? What's with the big fuzzy hat? So that Ari's like Ari's totally knocking him down and he's totally school me on, on, uh, all these, uh, these questions that I had. And then Marin comes out. There it is. Boom. Did Marin think that he was supposed to be there or they're just coming to Mary knew we were recording the first like 20 minutes. Oh, compensation,

Speaker 2:          01:41:10       front of a laptop and then he's probably in the groove now. He's a funny cat man. He's a, he's become a different dude. It's interesting. It's cool watching a guy finally drop some of the anger, like

Speaker 3:          01:41:22       getting success. Yeah, it's great when somebody, uh, yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:41:26       getting into it with people. He, Michael, Ian Black and him were going back and forth on Twitter or are they doing oh well my Michael Ian Black was dominating Marin on Twitter. Oh really? Oh,

Speaker 3:          01:41:38       I don't believe that's right. I don't care for it. They've done it before. Twitter slap downs. When comedians get all bitchy with each other, it seems to be, I mean, we're on the word, the lowest rung on the Showbiz. Slacker man. It's like dough lets you know. How about, how about a little malware brotherhood fellows could have easily been fucking around, but it just didn't seem like it told a great story that I had asked him about it. It's, it's a little different the way he tells it, but the way I remembered it, um, you know, Marin, he'd only been doing comedy for a couple of years. He moves to la, he's a doorman at the comedy store. He's living at the comedy store house and Kinison is massive at the time. And Kennison like to come by and party and everything and Marin's like, you know, only been to a comedy for a couple of years. And, um, he went to pick up a college friend of his at the airport and he comes back to the house and he comes in and Kennison is standing on his bed pissing and Marin turns to his buddy and he goes, I told you I knew him.

Speaker 3:          01:42:42       I heard Ken was a real piece of shit. He wasn't, he was a bad dude by the way.

Speaker 2:          01:42:47       Got To remember this a to say this, uh, our IISHA fears new comedy central show, the online version of it. Um, he, uh, has a new thing that comedy central studios is doing online. It's called this is not happening. And he just released the first one today. It's a Tj Miller has a seizure. I watched it. It's, it's brilliant. Especially the opening part of it. There's like this, he has this animated thing, pull it up Brian. It's uh, it's on the comedy central. A page on youtube, which is just comedy central. And um, it's, this is not happening. Tj Miller has a seizure. This is not happening. Just see the, the beginning of the opening, a animated video, whoever did it is a bad motherfucker cause it looks really cool and they decided to do it. It looks like they did it in a strip club. It looks like they did it in like one of those.

Speaker 3:          01:43:35       Yeah, it's a, it's a, it's a Cheetah's. Oh is it cheese or where we're in Atlanta. I know there's like a Cheetah is here, but that's where like Sam does a lot of comedy shows that really, Oh that's brilliant. Yeah. How would those shows those fun? Yeah. Great. Look at this opening in the least

Speaker 6:          01:43:52       amount of words possible. You're jumped out as HR. That was going to happen. Check this out. This is the opening animation for those newer saw three dimensional shits flowing. The air is really cool. Welcome to, this is not happening. Present crazy nights over a bunch of comedians tell stories. Similar subject. So this, this is an idea

Speaker 2:          01:44:23       Ari had a, that he came up with a long ass time ago, I think as like a writing exercise. I mean I think that was his idea. Just to have a different kind of show where you instead of just do like hardcore, like set up punchline, you know, created bits. He wanted people just tell wacky stories. Like the one time that like Bert Kreischer has a fucking story but getting so drunk that he's over his girlfriend's father's house and he's the guy walks down into the living room while he's pissing on the dining room table. Like standing there with his dick out on the dining room table pissing. Hmm.

Speaker 3:          01:45:01       We've all had a little too much to drink. Yeah. That's, that's some next level shit already. Storyteller nights at the Austin Moontower festival. He did, uh, uh, drug story. Yeah, I told that. Um, Dalai Lama tail. That's a great story. Yeah. Those are these things that already does. They're, they're really fun. I love that. And it really interesting. But sometimes people cheat. I've talked to already about just going to Israel and doing shows and um, and I just talked to Moshe Kasher. He had played this club that I wanted to look into and he said, you have to be squeaky clean. What would be the fun of that? What kind of world that you live in it, it's just we've all got handle, you know, fucking religious tension and fucking suicide bombers, but they can't handle a little dick.

Speaker 2:          01:45:43       Yup. Yeah. What the fuck? That's absolutely preposterous. That actually hurts my feelings. It does. It's going to be clean. Why? Why? What do you do? Are you going to live forever if you don't say fuck, what are you doing that you would need to join this more? If everything's fucking sanitized and like what? Like all due respect. What keeps a guy like Seinfeld doing stand up? Do you know anything about him? No, I don't. I know what kind of cereal he likes. He likes Porsche's. Let me know. He likes portion. Yes. It's like he's got like a hundred cars, some crazy Porsche fetish, you know, drives a lot of old ones and shit. Man. I know he's a great comic and you know, he's a great joke writer who's got great delivery, but he's got that one observational one layer style. Like there's no side

Speaker 3:          01:46:32       when I have children at won't allow them to watch him. I would never want my kids to, I relate that kind of comment, but look it online, pornography, kids, whatever you want. You watch them. Old Carland tapes. No Seinfeld in this house. Where does that other,

Speaker 1:          01:46:51       I had to go to this store. I go to the grocery store. I'm just picking up a couple of things. Jerry goes, go to the store jokes. It's an air who cheese? I just run down to the milk because they know each other. Oh, I know. We were both milk and I love you. You've grown up your cheese, you know, every, all bilk starts off cheese starts off as milk. When she sees milk, does it remember it's old friends. Look at you. You moved.

Speaker 3:          01:47:17       I should clarify. He, uh, I met him once and I didn't care for him. I thought he was, you know what happened? It was at the comedy cellar. It was 98, 99. I was living there. And um, I, you know, the seller, everybody goes to the seller, you know, at the end of the night. And I had a sat there and I get that, you know, it's, you know, it's a small club. There's a table in the back where Comedians, um, go on or before they go on. And I get there and every, all the comedians are in the hallway. Nobody's at the table and the, Oh, Jerry's here. And so I go back, I'm on next, I sit down and give them a little head nod. Hey, I liked the guy who up to that time, I could see him while I was on, I did 20 minutes and a, I had a great set.

Speaker 3:          01:48:00       I know that. And then the next night he's at the, uh, they had the Mediterranean restaurant upstairs and I get there early to do my set. And, um, I see Collin Quinn at the bar, he's a buddy of mine. And I go over to, Hey Collin, how are ya? And he goes, Hey, you know, Jerry and Jerry sit in there honker and over a plate of chicken wings and he's holding a chicken wing and he looks me up and down. And he goes, isn't that the same sport coat you had on yesterday? And I go, I only had one season on NBC. Jerry, you might be able to afford a different jacket every night of the week, but I only had one season. And he just like shrugged and he went back through his chicken wings and it's like, you know, a guy with that much money to like seriously look someone up and down and like criticized their clothing. There was guys in my high school that thought they were funny. That's all they did. It criticized peoples. You know, some people don't have money. I see some people having a tough time, hey, I'm sorry. You know, we didn't get the fucking wash the clothes or whatever, you know. Uh, but I always thought it was really cheap when people like just pick apart someone's appearance. That's not comedy. That's like being a bully. What do you know?

Speaker 2:          01:49:07       Yeah. And it had only works if you're not aware of the impact that it has on another person. Because as soon as you are aware of the impact that has on the other person and you do it anyway, you know like non instigated, you start off like picking on a guy's wardrobe, you're a Douche bag like this. There's no, but in his defense that is a style of like comedy interaction in New York. Everybody criticizes everybody and that they do it all the time and maybe he just wanted you like to know that you were like welcome.

Speaker 3:          01:49:38       Wow. And I took it the wrong way. Sorry Jerry. This is possible. I mean that's some chicken never heard of the guy being no, no. I you see him interviewed

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       a thousand times. You'd get an idea like Alec Baldwin going to have to start watching that show and then see Alec Baldwin yelling at you for something. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Like Alec Baldwin seems like he's a fucking hothead. It tightly wound. But Jerry Seinfeld, could you ever see Jerry Seinfeld screaming at a flight attendant? No, no, no. Yeah, I just don't think he's a Dick. I don't think he's got it. He might make a snide comment here and again, but so you go back, we did all routes. A few off. I'll let my kids watch him. I love Seinfeld. I liked the show. I think he's his book. It's good. I don't get the end up. I think his book is just as act. Yeah, I think you translate that to think in comedy. It's like always, you know, when I talked to stand up and stand up, did my thing, uh, who was it?

Speaker 1:          01:50:32       Somebody like David Cross was rude to everyone. So he told me stories like you can always remember, you always remember like who was it? Dig Tia and comedy when you were coming up. Yeah, I forgot that cross story that he tells that. So fucking rough story. It's a rough story and it was, you know, you know guys can get Douchey if you guys can get Douchey, but they didn't. That's the thing. You walk around as a comedian and you say, oh, we're all like, you know, brothers. No, not everybody looks at it that way. Most of us do though. TheW and the ones that do are the ones that you enjoy hanging out with the really self obsessed crazy ones that aren't about the camaraderie of stand up. Those are the ones that wind up kicking themselves in the Dick or stepping on their own foot.

Speaker 1:          01:51:09       You know there's, there's the silly ones there. They would have dummies like you, you wouldn't be any less funny if you just weren't an asshole to your fellow comics. It wouldn't make any less funny. Didn't buy the open letter to Larry the cable guy. Okay. It wouldn't make you less funny. It's not like you know you're going gangster, but calling out Larry the cable guy. Dan Whitney is a very nice guy. He's a very nice guy and I started out with him in Florida. Great Guy. There's a lot of other fucked up shit out there in the world that you should probably be concentrating on before you concentrate on the Larry the cable guy. Yes. It's just right where he's a nice fucking guy and he has delicious potato chips. Really? Brian telephones even more now. I heard that he has, not only does he have like a delicious potato chips, he has like delicious food, like hamburger helper type shit.

Speaker 1:          01:51:55       Oh really? He's coming down with, it owns food products. Cable Guy Larry, the cable guy has a cheeseburger potato chip. It tastes like cheeseburgers. Exactly. Like cheeseburgers. Like with mustard on it. Relish. It's fucking delicious. And why you're eating it. You're like, I'm going to eat one more and that's it. Because I think, I don't know. What the fuck is it? I don't know what kind of Voodoo they're doing on me that a potato chip tastes like. I just hated it in and out. It's very strange. Not In and out, but definitely Wendy's. It's fucking delicious. It's really good. It's like you're, you're eating a potato chip that tastes just like eating a cheeseburger. It's so weird, but it's, God, I can't be a smart move. I can't be a smart move. So hungry now. Oh, I got you with the fucking Larry, the cable guy. Potato chips. But I think

Speaker 2:          01:52:45       David Cross is just a, he's just a volatile artists. There were the same thing that makes them great.

Speaker 3:          01:52:51       Right. I know David, he's always been nice to me. I mean it's always see, depends on, you know, who you, who, who, who personal your experience with personal people that you meet and deal with. You know, Dave's never been anything. I've heard some people, I've met them, they were the nicest people in the world. And vice versa. David's cool to me. Even after I did fear factor, which, you know, if anybody was like taking the high brow approach, that'd be the time to think I was a loser serving people animal decks and then I, you know, just show us the classic, what's classic for me. I told you the last time I was on the shot that, that uh, the magazine industry in this country collapsed joke went down. Well, I'm one of the few people on Earth. They could say I lost the job because people had a drink cop. It's not a lot of people that, you know, not a lot of people that can say that, why'd you lose your last job? Uh, we were making people drink calm. Maca wasn't buying it. Check this out, Larry the cable guy at dinner and get her done. You want a body like mine? Look at the reviews I ever boughten. Oh, back it up. The first one, Star. What does the purse, I says, Oh, does anybody remember Larry's previous was on your recipe?

Speaker 3:          01:54:08       I can't recommend anyone buying this product. Ever Sing, seen his calm to retune a comedy routine on Poop Lasagna. Maybe they just were David Cross fans. He's got a lot of, she's got Mac and cheese. It's got chicken batter. He did have a joke. Hilarious chicken. Oh my God. How many stars does that have? Got Five stars, five stars. You know, you start feeling good about yourself in this business thing. Can you, you've, you know? Yeah. This guy's got this guy, he's got a private jet because he was selling Lasagna, fish batter,

Speaker 2:          01:54:46       fish batter. Jesus Christ. What's crazy is they think he's like that guy. It's like, you know Andrew dice clay who I'm a huge fan of when he, the dice man was one of his many characters that he would do, but it was so good that he's like fuck all these other characters. I'm just sticking with the salt dice man thing. And then he became the dice man. Now he's always the dice Matt. He's, but they've morphed and it's not like he's pretending to be the dice man. That literally is who he is now. So when he shows up with giant sunglasses on that like, you know like literally six inches high and he's got a fanny pack made a leather, which by the way, I've got a great fanny pack because of him. The route of people that are looking for a good fanny pack, a solid one. The leather roots fanny pack. That's the one that Andrew dice clay wares.

Speaker 3:          01:55:31       But he's done. He's a nice man that he sent in his fanny pack money cause Canada. What's that fanny pack line? Camp Roots. Canadian is a Canadian. Yeah. Well, if Americans just had the balls to produce a quality fanny back and not be those

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       weird vendors that you know, a fun and stuff on Amazon, you're like, man, do I send them my fan? He's like, what they call the silly vagina. They're still driving in the left hand side. They can't be, you know, you lose all your credibility when you're trying to cars so that you could use a sword. I heard that the reason they do that is because Napoleon, the conquering armies getting back to Paris, they chose the right side. So the left side is the loser side of the road. I think it's actually, I don't know. That might just be some weird. Both guys dude told me at a bar that wouldn't make any sense because then both guys be the loser because they're both on the left depending on which direction your head again. But back to Paris. Oh, back to Paris. Um, here's the, the thing, the one that makes sense to me is that if you're on the left hand side, you can defend yourself with your right, which is your, your strong arm.

Speaker 1:          01:56:37       Most people are dominant right handed and they would be holding the sword. So that's why they would pass on the left hand side. And since these are all like ancient cultures were talking about like England and mean, they're really ancient. I mean, you think about how long, I mean, you can go to a bar in England that's 900 years old. I love that. It's amazing. There's a bar in not numb. It's underneath the castle. It's on the backside. Uh, and it's where people would drink before they went off on to fight in the Crusades and shit. It's amazing. It's insane. My God. Yeah, that kind of like that kind of history. It's um, you know, it makes sense that they still have that left side of the road thing. That's what they did for fucking hundreds a year. That makes sense. Then you could use, you're right.

Speaker 1:          01:57:17       You're right. Yeah. Okay. Well then I guess that's the better side of that. Like if you're jousting, I think, you know, that's how you do it. Only you would think of something like that. No, it's not that only I'd so I asked, you know, oh, it didn't make any sense. I was like, this seems like every we American be. I asked somebody and they told me that Bullshit Napoleon, you know, well we've made the first cars so it would make sense that since we decided to driving the right, everybody would just honor that Dell like, yeah, not feeling it loud. I'm going to put the stint in wheel on the other side. I feel a little more comfortable like in Sword Swipe out the window. So they decided even though they wouldn't have to import our automobile because we're, the one's smart enough to figure it out first.

Speaker 1:          01:57:58       They still had to put it on the left side. That's you know, that's also just not one to bow down to American dominance and I was wearing, boy, a lot of them Europeans still got a lot of shitty idea is a friend of mine, this Guy Kevin Healy who runs the Roshan Dub, just cool rock club and Galway Ireland and they do comedy there. It sounds amazing. Wonderful Dude. I Love Golf. What's the name again? It's called the in dub. It's a, it's like fucking Celtic for black rose. I need to get a tee shirt. Can I buy one online? But yeah, of course. Yeah, totally. So, but he's, he's funny man and he's a really funny dude. And his talking gps in his car is a British woman's voice. And so I was driving around with him one and then like it was it, uh, take the third into the roundabout and take the third left and then like he'd drive it, you pass it. And they did go a different way and he'd just look at me and go, I need to word that in English, but it's still doing, Brian had a girl that he was daddy at one point in time who did not like that his navigation system had a girl's voice

Speaker 5:          01:59:04       because I would like choose like the British chick voice cause that I thought that was the sexiest one bed it, you know, whatever. And she was like, will you please change this? Why do we have to listen to her? And like every time I would come in my car, she would like have changed.

Speaker 1:          01:59:17       Jackson's, that's what's called a healthy relationship. Oh right. Imagine that. Try bringing that up to a psychologist. I, you know, he tries to make me jealous with the navigation system. It's a girl's voice and the girls are whore. Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:59:35       And I remember I, there was like, it was from Tom, Tom and I forget who it was. There was some kind of like sexy person that, that uh, that they ended up having these voice packs. You could buy like Darth Vader and then it was like a Bob Dylan. Right. And there was a sexy one that I bought and it just, yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:59:51       like blew the lid off or wait a minute. Yeah, that's how it was. Do you want to really make some money? Make a plugin with Joey, Joey Diaz telling you what a gold, what the fuck did I just locked up? Fuck did I just say left our dog, Chile. That would be the greatest navigation system of all time. We got to find investors. No one's done it. My friend David Herwoods did come up with an idea once, but it was an idea of Joey giving advice on the toilet. Like little, little short blurbs had to film it. Yeah. And he could put, they called it a fat man on the toilet, which is disrespectful, you know, you've got to coach Joey Coco Diaz on a toilet. That's what you want a fat man. It's not just cause he's fat, you know, that was a little on the spot and he's tall. He's tall man on the toilet, you know, you know, just describe them.

Speaker 5:          02:00:39       That was a low point in my life, Joe, being in that small bathroom and summer day with a Joey Diaz naked right in front of me. The balls hanging over the toilet seat somehow. I don't even know how that's possible. Did you smell him at all? Oh yeah. It smelled like a big Joey Diaz. Like, I mean it smelled like balls in there. Yeah. And then like his wife, uh, the person's house. It's what? Like the wife would come in with lemonade and just eliminate anyone, like real nice. And I'm like, don't you see his guys balls is right. Like this is so creepy. I felt like I was in Cape Horn. I thought that was, I thought that was a hidden camera joke on me at the time, Joe, because I was like, how am I in right now

Speaker 1:          02:01:17       is a joke. It was funny. I mean it was a Joey's funny in anything he does, man. Joey's was always funny. Hey, did you see this? A transgender navy seal? Yeah, count came out. Yeah. I used to be a dude is barely look in Evan Tanner looking dude with a big full beard and uh, got a sex change and became a woman and uh, now calls herself warrior

Speaker 2:          02:01:40       princess and just like went for a full sex change. I mean she, she was at one point in time, 20 years as a navy seal, fought some of the most dangerous battlefields in the world. After she left service, she realized she wasn't living in La. She wanted, I decided to become a woman to go from like that Quito, a ferocious fighting. This is off the sensitivity. That's either you got to applaud that person. Yeah. If that's what you want to do for sure. It's uh, you know, and um, I put it online and like some people like, um, um, still think there was, there's an issue with a transgender MMA fighter. Uh, there was a man who became a woman and then started fighting as a woman and MMA fights and like just brutally knocking these women out. Do you remember that? That in, in a, in the Thai boxing and then in the 90s, that was the opposite.

Speaker 2:          02:02:29       There was a guy and then with his monies cause winnings, he got the operations further as he went along. So he was really good and bad, a sex change. And then he didn't have any testosterone anymore. He started getting beaten up by girls can't, well this a transgender you formerly male, a woman can and she's knocked out three girls. Then she choked out another girl that recently. But there's, there's certain mechanical advantages to the human body when it's man, when it's born with a y chromosome. The testosterone were 30 years of his life before he became a woman. And I think that like there's, that's undeniable. There's also an advantage in reaction time, like what? It's 10% across the board advantage and reaction time for men over women. And like several tests. It's not like a one time thing where they got a bunch of slow checks.

Speaker 2:          02:03:20       Like there's something about the, the just the male constitution that makes it more better adapted to certain physical things. And fighting is one of them. And there's some people be, it became like this gender issue. And one of the things I found out this is, it's really fascinating. There's a rift in the feminist community and there's feminists that hate transgenders or should I say don't approve of transgenders being considered a woman. They think a woman is a woman. And when a man starts off life as a man, he stays a man. And you know the thing, the idea that that woman, that man is now a woman and can compete with women in athletics is ridiculous. And so one of the things they site is this MMA thing where this check is like I'm seeing, I'm not particularly talented, but she's just a man like bitches need him in the face and knocking them unconscious and putting them on the ground and putting her her knee on people's necks and choking them out quick.

Speaker 2:          02:04:11       And it's like she's not fighting like the elite of the elite competition. But the way she's winning is quite convincing and that sort of stirs the debate up. But I've never been in any way, shape or form against anyone who wants to be a transgender. My position is only as a martial arts expert. I've been doing martial arts since I was a child and I know that there are certain things that make someone physically more dangerous and one of them is bone structure. It doesn't change when you have big giant man hands, big giant man hands of dangerous as fuck and little tiny hands. No matter how good you get it, hitting things, they never really that dangerous. A little tiny hands break in your face like a woman's hand. They're not. They're not built for punching shit. You gotta wrap 'em up good and put them in pads.

Speaker 2:          02:04:56       Otherwise I'd just shatter on your forehead. There's a lot of things to to to being a man, like the way the hips are built. They, there's a mechanical advantage to using the hips that way, but that doesn't mean I'm against people being transgender. I think you should be able to do whatever the fuck you want and I think that there's going to be a lot of people when they do some sort of a chromosome will switch when they, they really get into high level genetic manipulation and they literally can turn you into a woman. I think every man should be forced to be a woman for at least a couple of months of his life just so you could feel what it feels like to be vulnerable. It feels that it feels like to be Douche on by guys. I mean maybe if like, you know how you have to like you, you live in Israel and you have to like do like a couple of years in the service.

Speaker 2:          02:05:38       I think every man should have to be forced to live a couple of years as a woman. Really as a real woman, like, Yo, you're a 250 pound man. No, you're a 90 pound Chinese girl now and this is how you gotta live your life for the next two years, two years as a woman. So you have like real empathy, but it feels like to be overpowered or threatened by the opposite sex or the people who were like sexually attracted to you also being the most likely ones to take your life. You know, I think when that happens, it would be a very strange world when you can just say, Tom, what do you this week? Oh Dude, I'm a black guy. And

Speaker 1:          02:06:17       Oh my God, Brian would be girls put together a funk band immediately if you get, if Brian can be anything super woman, super woman or wonder woman, super woman wonder woman had more cool shit though. She had a chat and she had, but I guess superwoman can fly in her own right, cool, cool places and masturbate. But yet she never achieved the fame. That wonder woman had. It's like what separates Whitney Cummings from Eliza swessinger? What is it that makes Whitney Cummings so much more successful? That's like wonder woman over superwoman. I mean maybe Supergirl or whatever the fuck she was. Maybe she was really bad ass, but she never got nearly the props. That wonder what my guy wonder woman with her jet. Do you remember the Dave Chappelle joke he used to do about that she had an invisible jet? No. What did he say? What's that prostitute?

Speaker 1:          02:07:05       They look like the most ridiculous outfit. If you could be, if I could be any superhero know if between super woman or why do I say I would rather that Carter, I remember Linda Carter, super woman was blonde hair, so she wouldn't have to shave as much like her legs, like you know, Brown hair, you'd have to shave more. So I think it was less mace maintenance to be superwoman. I think you're right. And I think that wonder woman can't even fly on her own. She needs a plan and that just stupid. Plus she's got her magic of truth and she's right. And then the bullet proof, a wrist band. Since she's fucking Ka Ching Ching. And you can move that fast to hit bullets with your wrists please. I can't remember like captain slow all the other times he didn't fly either. Yeah. Like yeah, he was, he just had a sword. Well Captain America was like the ultimate roid man. Like they created him with like a roid. It's like a Super Roy, like they shot off, he's a little skinny guy in the movie. Is the movie the same as the comic book? I never even bothered to watch that piece. It wasn't really a captain [inaudible] even though it was a marvel comic. I mean that was in my wheelhouse, but I was never really a captain America guy. But the movie's not bad.

Speaker 3:          02:08:13       Well I remember Captain America and I know when I was a kid in the 70s eighties looking through, he would be getting his ass beat and then his black friend, the Falcon would show up. It was always captain America is getting his ass beat and then his black friend and it was like, you know, like the mid seventies where like, you know, they're trying to like integrate like a black superhero, but they didn't want to give him his own magazine. So then the Falcon would come in and save the day and kick everybody's ass.

Speaker 1:          02:08:42       You don't remember the time I do now that you brought it up or I remember very much. That's hilarious. So, uh, dude who played them? Um, uh, did, they didn't have the falcon the do to play to captain America. It was perfect. Did you see the Avengers? That dude, it looks like Captain America. He's the perfect guy. He's perfect. I just don't like the character at all, so I don't even bother, you know, the movie is pretty good dude. Give it a shot. I seen the first, no, no, no. There's captain America. Really Captain America. Why is it just because you hate patriotism and you hate America?

Speaker 3:          02:09:14       I think that's it. No. Is it really, you hate like Rah Rah old, the old, the old captain America with his little flags. And stuff like that. I was, I was like, get outta here.

Speaker 1:          02:09:25       Built such a nice success off. Nah, I don't hate the country. I did just, his costume was dumb. Has I know what you're talking about. You don't want it, you know, this is the rob, rob, rob bullshit.

Speaker 3:          02:09:38       Well, you know, just giving him some better superpowers when they conceived that he was crazy though. When in the fifties during world or two

Speaker 1:          02:09:46       or are we supposed to be fighting against the Nazis? Like it's okay to be like Super Patriot guy when you're fighting against a legitimate evil army. You know? I mean, that was like a legitimate evil army. But then once the United States army becomes legitimately evil, then captain America becomes a goofy character and that that's the problem. It's like, it's really hard to, when you look at foreign policy and drone attacks, and it's really hard to think that those fucking people that are pulling off what they're pulling off, wherever the fuck we are, you know, whether it's the invasion of Iraq or any of the crazy shit they're doing, they have fact that the idea that a noble man, like Captain America would be rushing to very to save the day, making sure the rest of the world has oil for centuries to come. Just dodging bullets. Flying a kickass.

Speaker 2:          02:10:35       Yeah. Not the best one. He's not the best. The hawks, the bass, clearly

Speaker 9:          02:10:38       like they do. It's a lot of comics. I tried to get into like daredevil. I tried so hard to get in the dairy that, but having a blind guy, just not that sexy and that's all yours. You're just blind to because he's blind and you look to move. Good. Had over like better sense. Come on. So there shit, I don't know and I can't remember any more than that to get me to buy a fucking comic book. God dammit. Silver surfer is the wall. The biggest one. I always wanted to like love. It never really did it for me like I tried so much, but that's such a cool idea for a superhero like I got, I didn't get, I try, I mean I bought them and I just never got into it. Why? Your man was really hard for like, I thought the stories were great. All that Spiderman's Peter Parker web, all the geos. You mean the movie silver surfer, but did you buy the common notes? Comic books? I'm talking about common core. I feel the same way. Like when I got silver surfer comic books, I would be like, Ooh, a new silver surfers out, check it out and then I'd be like Yam, blah blah. Whereas like Spiderman was always legit. Yeah. Spiderman always had x men always best storylines

Speaker 2:          02:11:39       ever. I mean they had some epic storylines with Phoenix, you know what I mean? That was a, that was a great, great comic book era. That was, that was the real shit man, you know, to Dorks, Dorks, how many people listening, right? Like dorks. That was one of the saddest things I had to do when I was starving to death. I was telling my comic book collection needed the money, man. I had nothing and that's all I had left some comic books that I accumulated over, you know, 10 years of life out there in the world.

Speaker 9:          02:12:09       I've been read downloading a lot lately on using like the Marvel App. You can just sit there and be like, I want every episode of Hawk. Oh you don't? Okay.

Speaker 2:          02:12:16       Comic books like physical comic books are bad ass, but the best experience is on an iPad. Get that marvel app on the IPAD and they go frame to frame. Yup. Then you don't see what's next and then you know like you never see a comic book where you see, you know, you always see every page and you see it right in front of you. As you're changing the page, you see the left page to the right page, see what's coming with these apps. He just goes and goes frame to the frame

Speaker 9:          02:12:40       and assumes that in real quick, kind of like a movie. Did you ever think that you'd be like pushing fucking 40 and still talking about comic books? Yeah. You never appeared anticipated a period of a golfing, no joke. I posted a uh, a test the other day. I don't know if you saw this, this is a friend of mine told me to take it and it's something that I guess a lot of people take in college and I, it's like 50 questions and I ended up taking it and wow. How crazy. Like horoscope wise, like how crazy accurate it is. And, and if you just read a what, see what it's called, if I can find it real quick, um, if you, if you do it, I'm really wondering what it is, but I asked what everybody else was and they were all the same. Like they almost every single person wrote back.

Speaker 9:          02:13:28       Like I took the test, I am a I n t, s, p, whatever it was. And that's like the smallest percentage of people in the world is this group of people that all are following me on Twitter. So it was really weird. Here's the test that you can go to. What is the, um, the distinguishing factor that makes them like a really small group? I don't know. It's just like, you see good. I'm e s F P and I guess the test is based on some kind of old school. Well, let me try to find it. It's called the Junge elaborate way for you to plug your Twitter, the typology tests. Did you ever take Carl Young? Carl Young. And so I took this and you can go to like human metrics.com and it's around there, but I took this test and just look at this like description of me.

Speaker 9:          02:14:13       Uh, it's uh, extroverted sensing. What does it say was extroverted sensing, feeling perceiving. And see what it does is it tells you like, here's all the different ones that you can be. And it tells you go down, uh, uh, like SFPs love to talk to people about people. Some of the most colorful of story tellers are ESF piece. Like, like you go through this thing and then you can even get more accurate. And they have like these horoscopes that are really like, Whoa, that's intense. That's a fascinating, you know what the problem with these things as though the problem with these tests is that you know, you're taking a test. Yeah. Oh, here's another thing. That famous Esu would give them the answer, the simulation theory. Bob Hope. Bob Hope. That's hilarious. Well, it's just, you know what it is you, you, when you know you're taking a test, you might not necessarily reveal the way you would respond to something, uh, a regular basis had you not been measuring it.

Speaker 9:          02:15:07       But the questions are pretty basic questions. Like if you go like, like you know how to put every minute of your time to good purpose. No, I definitely did not know how to do that. You know, so it's, you know, or you're a person somewhat reserved and distance and communication, I would say. Yeah. Besides podcasts, you know, it's just, you know, yes and no. It's not. The actions are frequently influenced by emotions. Yes, definitely. You usually plan your actions and events. Those are things that you could decide. What's your thinking with a group of people attending parties shot. Yes. You could decide. They seem pretty like nonjudgmental, which is I think important. If you're going to really have something like that and have it be accurate. But I would imagine that would be very hard to like get a sense of someone's personality like that. Try it out. I would really try to stay cause I, I've read it and it blew my mind. I was like no fucking way cause I've been getting attention. I know what drives me nuts, man. When someone tells me they talked to a psychic and the psychic knew everything about me. Man, it's amazing. Yeah. Dude, I'm telling you man. The psychic dude, he knew he knew about my grandma. Okay. And you're like, oh yeah, we need a name that begins with as a grit.

Speaker 9:          02:16:16       She a woman. Would you say you were from Boston? She's from the east coast. I would, you know, I just know since your grandmother was on the East Coast, um, what is your father alive? No, he wasn't.

Speaker 2:          02:16:29       I didn't think he was. No, no. Yes, he was alive. Yes, that's right. He was alive. Your father was a lot of, I see that. It's amazing. You see so much? Yeah, we'll have a gift of sight and these cards helped me. These cards. It's random cards with drawings on them. They help me to help me. See what's hilarious is that no one ever finds out any new shit. They just tell you shit. You already know you fuck. Like you know dude, he, he knew all about my grandmother. Don't you know all about your grandmother? Jesus Christ son.

Speaker 3:          02:17:02       Why? Why did you go somewhere to tell you that green is green? See that color green? There's no better. There's no better forecast for the future. Then a Chinese fortune cookies. I've based my life up. I had one a couple of months ago. It said you are going to come into a lot of money. So I took it to the bank. I was like, can I get an advance? Why Catskills choke? How about the people that take them and they the really good ones they save in their wallet. Show you guys, your fucking dog may trust me. Like modern ones. There's different, uh, well why would they make new ones? Just keep those fucking dumbass like all the lottery throw this horoscope. Who Cares? People are always going to eat Chinese food. It's delicious. Throw that stupid shit in there. Some of them, they are not, you know, unfortunate dented in San Francisco and like 1902 makes sense. I went to China. I was like, man, where's my fortune cookie? You don't, you don't get cookies. They never carried it over.

Speaker 2:          02:18:03       Well that's, you know, Chinese aren't really innovators. You know, they are they the copy. I would think that they would make it better Chinese fortune cookie. The Bullock look, you know, you guys, you had it down

Speaker 3:          02:18:12       but hologram it doesn't. Yeah, it's not dead. Father should, it should make a noise. They always make the cheap shit like the cheap knock offers and it's like they're never making like the iPhone. They're always making like the iPhone or will they actually make I iPhones there? Yeah. I mean it's shine is that massive industry. A lot of Shit in China. The iPhone factory, they got the nets around it because all these people were committing suicide. Yeah. Their answer was a, Hey, get back to work. That's based on the apple specs I'm talking about like all the other company outs there, companies out there, you know, there's definitely a lot of that. There's a lot of cheap shit. You mean made in China was always like a statement, right? Where else are you going to get refrigerator magnets and snow? And I looked at it and it said, made in shine a black,

Speaker 2:          02:19:03       but they also make some fucking pretty dope shit. What's really funny is that, that uh, that company, the, uh, where people were jumping off the roof, what was it called again? Foxconn. Foxconn. Foxconn. The argument was this, I actually saw a guy saying this. He was saying, well, you have to realize that this is an enormous company and the percentage of people that are committing suicide is with the percentage of people in a normal population of that many. You're talking about a company that employs a half a million people. Yeah. But the killing themselves at work, right at work, the live at work, they're killing. I mean, is it, are you really, can you really say that they're like a regular population, extra pee break and they just get nothing. They get very little money and they claw and scratch. Just the fact that we still allow that someone's kind of come up with something called the fair phone.

Speaker 2:          02:19:59       Have you heard of that? Pull it up? Yeah, it's a phone they're trying to do. It's a to you son of a bitch. It's a, it's a, an android phone. And um, I think the idea is that they can trace the origins of all the resources that are in the phone, minerals and such and show you that it's all been acquired to fair trade and it hasn't been a slave labor used. And you know, that seems like a boring phone. Well, they can't, it's not even going to have four G, which is, I mean, it looks like a regular android phone. What is their, uh, their, their spiel?

Speaker 9:          02:20:36       She didn't say products and made by starting with a single phone together, we're opening up the supply chain and redefining the economy one step at a time.

Speaker 2:          02:20:43       I love the idea. I think the idea is amazing, you know, but you got to have four g stupid. How dare you, how dare you put out a phone in 2000 and fucking 13 and say, well for Lte was problematic, then your fucking phone is problematic because I would jump on, everybody would jump on. You can do it, man. Just make it four g silly. Get the funding gap. Get a Kickstarter like Graham Hancock. He has another Kickstarter. Alex Grey, sorry. Sorry Graham. Alex Grey's Kickstarter hit $250,000. So that ends the on thing that he's, you know, Alex, no, Alex Graves, the visionary artists. It was really psychedelic, crazy trip to mean art. You never seen his stuff. Oh, it was amazing. Oh, here it's like this, this, this visions book. Alex. Cool. You're seeing that stuff before. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It makes sure you have, but uh, he's um, creating that like the cover of this uh, um, visions book.

Speaker 2:          02:21:38       He's creating something that's, that's beautiful. That cover. Yeah. He's creating something really similar to this, like this style of art. Like this, the style thing as a building, he's going to have a religious building called the end theone. That's like this nondenominational spiritual sort of building that he's putting together and it's going to, how's it inside this building that's created essentially out of psychedelic art and he did a Kickstarter and offered a lot of really cool shit, including painting people's personal or drawing people's personal pictures, drawing, drawing of an Alex Gray version of them and a lot of cool shit.

Speaker 9:          02:22:14       I need to do a Kickstarter to get a condo somewhere nice and like Malibu or something. I'll make it spiritual if you want me to. We can all smoke weed if you want. Well, thousand bucks, you get to crash on the couch once. That's all right. That's not how Kickstarter works on. They have to get something out of it too. Well, I'll film it and you guys can all download me and my new condo in Malibu Sucking Dick. Why did you say suck it today, Brian there. Just think about what you're saying and then count to three and then stay. Stay with the thought and he goes, this worth saying, I mean, it's like you can't, um, you can't just have a Kickstarter to get yourself a condos on. No, you can't. Well, you can do is you could say, Hey, I'm making a documentary about me getting a super sick condo in Malibu and I need 300 and no. Well, $200,000. To tell you what Brian, nobody would see that comment that is basically bulletproof and no one would ever call scam. They would say, hey, you're just doing this so that you could get this super dope condo or buddy. Uh, John, uh, has a nice Kickstarter. Schwab, what is his, uh, Les Schwab, Schwab. I, it's too, uh, for him to become super rich. That's the whole Kickstarter.

Speaker 10:         02:23:36       John was Wa you may recognize me from my popular youtube videos, televisions, the league, or simply as someone you admire an envy because I'm awesome and famous. My fans come up to me all the time and asked me, John, what aren't you going to make a movie? My answer is always the same. It's bodyguard

Speaker 9:          02:23:53       beat the shit out of this gross poor person who's not addressing me as surly Schwab. A second most common question I get from my fans. Stop right there. If I was his friend, I'd say edit that. What was that part I didn't get with that part was parts called not funny. They just swing, didn't work. He's a funny guy. You know we all fucking throw turns up there. Actually we was trying to do, didn't work. Oh man, you were great.

Speaker 1:          02:24:23       The last time I saw you at the laugh factory. It was like six months ago. Oh thanks man. Thank you. Dig Bit about that. The horse fuck video. Ah Damn. It was, it was like a 10 minute bit. It was straight. I was just there and it's called Enim cloth. Oh really? I was just there. Yeah, and they're all very embarrassed about it. It's really interesting. I like brass plaques up marking. Well it's a real rural area. It's at the base of a mountain. I think it's a Mount Rainier. It's to the, it's one of those mountain communities and they were really bummed out that their, their town is known for that now. Like you ask him about it. They were, there's a few like really nice. There's a place called Charlie's shout out to Charlie's the best fucking pancakes you'll ever eat in your life, man. And eat claw. Pretty fucking dynamite. It's like a real like home cooking place. We were up there looking for bigfoot

Speaker 9:          02:25:10       for this new show I'm doing isn't the definition of looking. There has to be something to actually see. Brian is, you're not the expert of everything doesn't exist. You're not looking. Oh you say it doesn't exist,

Speaker 1:          02:25:24       but how do you know that's like looking for goats. You can't really look for wine and it doesn't exist, which you can, you can go look for ghosts. It doesn't mean you're going to find it goes. But if there are ghosts occasionally and you're not looking, you're never going to find them. And if you're living your whole life, never seen a ghost do you? Like there's no fucking goes. And then one day you see a ghost, you shit yourself and you don't have a picture of it. You can never explain it. And you try to tell people and they like, yeah, you saw it ghost because no one's going to ever believe anything that they haven't seen themselves. Unless you could show me a picture of it unless you can show me. I don't even believe in quantum theory. You know why? Cause he can't show it to me.

Speaker 1:          02:25:59       I don't know what you're doing. I show all, see all those lines and squiggles. I believe you're correct. I would never doubt, but I don't, I have no idea if that's real. I have no idea if that's real, but big foot. I think he's real. You know, you do not think he's real. Tom Rounds the tell you what man. Hey man, if anything's real, you're entitled. That the only thing is real. I think Eddie Murphy, he's a better actor. Denzel Washington or you be serious. You're just being silly. I think we all have, we're all entitled to our opinions. Seriously being silly because any, if we can act as dicta up, he just doesn't do it very often. I think he acted it already. I bet he did his bed at best acting when the cops asked him why that training was in his car. It was a little character.

Speaker 1:          02:26:42       Do the research. I was taking him home officer, that is ain't homeless. Tranny explained yourself, but I guarantee you that, I mean, look at how good he was and um, uh, the nick naulty 48 hours, it's fucking great in that movie. Great. As an actor as well, like not just great as a bad guy and you know what else, what was he like four different characters. That's something that, and I'm not endorsing this movie in any way, shape or form, but that Ben Stiller movie about, uh, the robbery, the fucking there was on the top floor, the penthouse something. It was like, what the hell was that called? The heist heist heist. Not a bad movie really was, it got, took a lot of shit. It was pretty fun. The premise is ridiculous, but Eddie Murphy's a bad ass fucking actor. Like, you forget how subtly is like, how he could pull shit off though.

Speaker 1:          02:27:35       You know, it's really sad that all that trainee shit went down because when that trainee shit went down, Eddie Murphy stopped doing stand up, you know, he did raw and then, you know, he kinda like just went to movies and maybe he would have went back 10 years after raw and then the trainee thing was it? Yeah, it was a than my timeline's wrong, but I just feel like maybe he would've gone back to it if it wasn't. I wish she would've. That's why I was excited when he was going to host the Oscars that like, just give us a hint of it, Eddie, just a couple of minutes. This is the truth. When Raul came out and I was, uh, I don't know how old I was, I guess I was probably 18 or something like that. I don't remember. Somewhere around that. Somewhere around the teenage years. And I remember seeing raw on TV and we, me and my friends were fucking crying.

Speaker 3:          02:28:22       We're crying and it doesn't totally hold up today because a lot of the premises have been like beaten down since then. A lot. I remember that was an event when it came out, it was in the theaters, but you coming off a delirious, delirious was so strong. Oh, you know what? Every moment and then it was like he had gotten money and then he's telling stories about bodyguards and bill Cosby actually meant delirium. Delirious said that because yeah, I told this was the TV one. That was the HBO where he's in the back, the movie and he's got the blue suit. No, I definitely met you and your friends were really laughable. Rod Rod was not that good. That's it. That's it. No, that was like, it was like when rap guys get too much money, when they rap guys come out, they're great. The first three albums or from the street, they got the message and then like the third, fourth album, dude, who's going to clean my pool is late.

Speaker 3:          02:29:10       You know, there's some of that money that takes the sting out of a lot of people and then awesome. Then he had gotten a few live changes round. Yeah, yeah. You know the life you live as a comedian, there's gotta be some folly in it, you know, and when everyone's just lining up to suck your Dick and pay you in diamonds, this is not a lot of the following. Did you see that, that Eddie Murphy thing? Well it was on comedy central. They, um, they did some like, you know, honor him evening and who was it told this great story? Um, oh my God, I forgot it. It's a, but I guess it was Arsenio Hall or something. And some woman comes over there at like some black club and some white woman comes over to Eddie Murphy goes, Eddie, Eddie, I love you. I've never, I never kissed a, uh, a black man before.

Speaker 3:          02:29:57       Can I kiss you? And he goes, no. He goes, you don't start at the top. You got to start with one of these poor. And that's fine. You can't start at the top. Pay Delirious. You know, before delirious, he had a CD. I don't even have a CD. I think it was like a set, but he had a cassette that was really good. I think maybe even better than delirious cause it was really like low pressure. Give delirious has a gift. I got, I get a little nephew man and he likes comedy and then like the lyrics a little like teenage kids and stuff, they want to like, uh, you know, they asked me, you know, who should I, who should I study? Here's delirious. Let's start start here. If you're like a teenager and you're not really into radical shit yet, you just send the solid funny, it's too bad that he stopped.

Speaker 3:          02:30:42       You know, it's interesting, you know, there was also, it's just a, I'm sure when you're probably the number one comedy movie star in the world, like it's probably really hard to get up a desire to go write and create new jokes and they're probably just constantly shoving movies down his face back then. You know, he went in after 48 hours and I mean he was gigantic, gigantic. He was, I liked the party, Yada. No, it's my girl wants to had a hit song and dance song. It was a hit song about his girl who to party all the time. That is a drag man. If you're dating a girl and she just wants to go out all the time and dance and party. I don't like the friends I've met friends break up of girls cause they just want a party all the time to like listen, okay you're, you're escaping something here. We can't do coke seven nights in a row. All right. Keep needed. He needed to take a nap and you need to get a help. Wanted, look, pick up that. Finding an occupation. You can't just be out there partying or you can forget it if you got an act, you know, travel the country Tom road style. Just go gangster. Tell it road the road. Glad you clarified that. You're like, you can't party all the time. I'm like oh parties all the time.

Speaker 3:          02:32:06       Do you ever think that a, you're going to settle down in the city? Yeah. I'm considering a few places where you consider him a, I'd like to move back to San Francisco and just a, you know, just, I mean, just creating jokes. That's the, uh, you know, that's the main mission. Yeah. I liked it. The, you know, the tech industry is based out of there and I think, you know, uh, things are moving. I think that the future, I mean like you can be your own movie mogul studio now and uh, I, you know, I don't know. I think, um, um, you know, it's a lot of entertainment. Yeah, no, there certainly is. I think that's too, it's a great place to do stand up. It's also a lot of smart people there. It's a good audience. When I come to La, I like staying in Nice hotels, you know, some of that living here and paying rent.

Speaker 3:          02:32:52       I Dunno. Maybe I haven't lived in the right neighborhood. Can I crash at your place for a couple of months? Sorry, I'll sweep the helicopter pad every once in a while. You won't get along with the family. I'm like, this guy is just, he's going to draw you to the dark side. Don't worry. My will is strong. I'm kidding. I uh, I don't know. And then also, you know, and then New Orleans is a place that I would consider, that's a wild sound. Yeah, that's a, that's a free town there. The, that's like almost like you should have a passport to go to New Orleans. It seems like some sort of Caribbean island you just drop off into connected to the rest of the country. And, and then again, uh, I, I wouldn't mind moving back to, to Amsterdam or Europe maybe, you know, get a place. And Tim, what about for your stand up?

Speaker 3:          02:33:36       What do you think would be the best place? Do you like to have a home club to work out of? No, but I, you know, I love the stand hope model. You know, he works his ass off for like two or three months and then you'll take a month off, you know, go home to take several months off at times. And I liked that. I liked that he does that where I'm, I'll only take a week or two off, you know. Uh, I liked that notion, Stan hope was doing it the perfect way. Yeah. He's so, I mean it's so, so with that in mind, you could live anywhere, you know, you, you know, why not have a place in Greece or in south of France or you know, more travel time. That's, that's the pain of the deck. And some people like to have a club that's close that they can fuck around and practice that. Like when I lived in Boulder, I was doing the comedy in Denver. It's only like an hour and a half

Speaker 2:          02:34:19       from where I live. It's pretty easy. Drive down there, boom, do a set, get right back to the wilderness, you know, it's like that way. Get sort of the best of both worlds type situation going on. You know, I think that a, a home clubs. Nice. It's nice to have a spot. So like we're standing up is on Bisbee. There's no fucking club. So that crazy asshole. Just do a show in his back yard, set up some speakers,

Speaker 1:          02:34:43       plug the Mike and he did a show in Vegas and some dude's backyard.

Speaker 2:          02:34:48       There was a guy in Vegas, some kid who was hiring comedians to do shows in his yard and have his friends come over and uh,

Speaker 1:          02:34:55       it was supposed to be a great gig. San Jose, he say about it, right? Said it was awesome. We got it. Got It. Got shut down by like city ordinances or something. Yeah, he didn't have the proper permit.

Speaker 2:          02:35:03       That's a bummer. What the fuck is that? When would the proper permits are?

Speaker 3:          02:35:08       Well then you could shut down lemonade stands, you know, so you don't, and you don't have a permit.

Speaker 2:          02:35:11       Right. But you don't want anybody throwing like crazy late night parties in the backyard next to you. That would suck. Like what if they were playing bad rap music? Like you're cool with it if it's stand up. And it's funny, like it's Stan Hope.

Speaker 1:          02:35:23       Do I stand out or whatever. Some terrible, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo hoo.

Speaker 2:          02:35:30       Yeah. Did you see? He tried to get some fucking sleep and you're like, God damn it, this is death. Maybe that's how they feel about Stan hope. Talking about aids.

Speaker 3:          02:35:44       When I, uh, when I turned 16, my parents made the tactical error of going out of town that weekend and I threw one of the biggest parties Oviedo high school had ever seen and there were just cars parked all down the block and just massive party and people just, you know, drinking on, I, I was uh, talking to like three of the hottest girls in my school, in our living room and this guy vomits on the, on our living room, carpet. You know what I mean? What am I do? I'm going to get down on my hands and knees, you know, in the middle of this party or that, these girls that I, I care about, uh, you know, watch me cleaned some vomit. Ha. So what'd you do? He sprinkled some dog food on it and let the dog in that?

Speaker 1:          02:36:31       No. Did you really? Oh, you fucking foul human being. Why would you want to dog me drinking diet? It was a the cleanest carpet area that dog haunted you with dog farts. Poor dog. Come on ripping horrible farts. Bio farts. Worst here. Your dog's Fart. When you look over it and be like, come on man, for real. Hey, that's when the dog is comfortable with you. They're always comfortable with your man. They never hold in farts. I was just something about dogs. They never figured it out. You yell at them when they farm. They never put two and two together like what the fuck are you yelling at him, man, I'm just here doing my steak.

Speaker 2:          02:37:16       I'm just being mad. I didn't even move

Speaker 1:          02:37:19       fucking stinky bitch. You ever have a dog wake you up with a fart? My dogs used to Fart so bad. I'd be in bed. I'm black.

Speaker 2:          02:37:29       Oh God. What the fuck? It was like I was eating shit in bed.

Speaker 1:          02:37:34       No, especially if you feed them wet food. That's the key. Dogs love that wet food. But that wet food would just just all gels together and stomach and the fermentation process and then when it comes out, just, Oh, you're just, you feel it. You feel it. Before you even smell it. Oh my God, we got this subject. What? Doug Fir forest, if you like dogs, you got to deal with that. It's a weird thing that we have certain animals that we, we, we cherish and certain animals that we just, you know, we slaughter on a regular basis and they're clearly defined. And when we step outside of those lines, people get really upset. I was watching this thing on TV where they, uh, it was in the, one of the British papers, they were showing these this, the latest trend is can the lion hunts.

Speaker 2:          02:38:21       Oh, I just saw that on the Guardian. The Guardian. That's what it was. Yeah. I love the Guardian. Yeah. It's really crazy. If you haven't seen it, the raise these ends discuss, did you see that? It was on today's in today's go guardian on their website, us. And it was this beautiful lion, just massive line. And the guy standing there, we're like, oh, this is right Baltic underneath it. Yeah. Well what's really crazy is this, is this not even a wild lion that's inside of a fence. These are hand raised lions. So what they do is they take them from their mother, like right away, all they see is people, they see lion cubs and people and the people provide them food and the people pet them. So that's how you train these lines to be more docile. So that's how when people were wandering around shooting these lines, these lines aren't stalking them and killing them because these lions associate people with being like their parents.

Speaker 2:          02:39:13       So this is like one of the weirdest, strangest sort of canned hunts ever because it's like shooting big dogs. It's really similar shit. What's the sport in that? If you see how these lions are with the people that are in this, uh, this park, before they send them to this park, there's another company that's a farm that grows these lions and they take them away from their mom and then they feed them with bottles and they're cuddling with him and shit. And then when they get full grown, then they let him loose in this park and it's just this big giant fenced in place. And the lions are walking around and then they let loose the white people. And then the white people come in with these guns and they set up and there's like four or five guys, Shit went the lions because the lion makes it charge when you shoot them, if you heard them, they'll fucking charge at you.

Speaker 2:          02:40:00       They know what happened. And so you got to like have like four or five dudes at the same time shooting. So watch this, like the lines just sitting there chilling. Oh yeah they do. I'll look. So he shot at him and missed the line of what the fuck's going on. The line doesn't recognize it as a threat at all. And then now he hit him. Now the lions running at them and then they dropped the camera cause they the line hit with a bullet. Okay, it's dying but it's running at them. So they just started firing at it as it's running fat white men. Well this is so crazy because this is Gus. This is not even something that you would eat for food. And they're pretending that this is the dangerous game. They pretending that this is the, they're the great white hunter and they're out there taking down a lie in and then they have it in their home. Look, this is a lion I shot while I was in Africa, but really they've done, they've taken the balls out of the lion hunt.

Speaker 3:          02:40:52       Dang. Right. See Look, there's four guys with rifles. Yeah, I remember I went to, I was in Savia Spain and uh, I went to the bull fights. I had seen it once in, in Mexico and it was one dude versus a bowl, you know, uh, I had read Hemingway's death in the afternoon, you know, manly. It was like the minor leagues of bull fighting. There was four guys against one bull. One guy goes out there with the Red Cape and then another dude sneaks up behind it with the prongs and sticks it in it. And I got upset. It was like the most cowardly chicken shit stuff I'd ever seen in my life. And that's what that lion thing reminds me. I would like really for guys with rifles

Speaker 2:          02:41:30       isn't those things. They Jab in the bowl, aren't they poisoned as well? Hm. I Dunno. I didn't think so. I thought, oh they poison Brian. You know what time those things that jab and a bowl during a bull fighting it aren't. They may have poison in them. No, I don't know. I'm touring. I think they do, but either way they're stabbing. I'm, you know, fucking him up. He's hurt bad. Yeah. It's that, that line thing

Speaker 3:          02:41:51       disturbing. It's really disturbing, which just shows how weak people are. It's just such a weird thing to want to show you that everything is for sale. You can have any experience you want. If you're really flush. They've appealed to the weakest of, of people. You know, the people that would want to go there just to shoot something and say they shot it in. So you're shooting a pet. I mean essentially that's a pet that's been let loose and this, the fact that they're trying to look at this little hot dog is licking a lion, you know? Oh, that's adorable. That's adorable. You know, like, like that line clearly is not a fucking day. I mean if you went, if you went to his case will probably fuck your world up if you want it. And you know, the man lion, uh, it's pretty lazy. It's just lie around and fuck all the time. The woman lion does all the hunting, right?

Speaker 2:          02:42:36       Yeah. If he's well fed, the male lion is there to defend, to make sure that he protects the, uh, the females and the cubs against other males that will come in and try to rough everybody up and eat all the babies. That's a, when a new male comes in the big mail, it has to be able to keep that mail out because if that mail gets in, it's very likely he's going to kill all the cubs. If they're not his, he'll just dominate, takeover, start fucking all these checks again and kill their babies. So that's what the male is supposed to do. Wait, I'm supposed to just take care of everything and fight off hyenas. There you got lions.

Speaker 1:          02:43:12       Just sad. It's edutainment. It's sad that people would want to do that. They would actually want to go and shoot some something that's basically a pat and in this fenced in area, you know, we've, we've talked about a Ted Nugent on the show before Ted Nugent has a show called the spirit of the wild. It's kind of fascinating. Um, and he has a, these ranches, two of them, one up in Minnesota and one in Texas with his offense din ranch with all these deer running around on it. And he sits up in a tree and he puts food out and the deer walk up to the food and it sticks. And with a bow and Arrow, his bow. Yeah, but he eats all the meat. I mean, that's all he eats. And he enjoys doing it and you know, it's all his property, Jeremy, it makes you very flatulent. So He's a [inaudible]. He said, what'd you hear that I haven't you ever had venison? Yeah. Half Lights. The buddle hold up. Hmm. Maybe that's a personal thing. I reveal too much about what makes me flatulence milk. No ice cream, ice cream and have horrible farts.

Speaker 3:          02:44:08       Did, uh, what was it politically incorrect when it was on comedy central years ago? Yeah. When Bill Maher was first, you know, this first version of his show with Ted Nugent. So nobody got in an edge, a word, a word, edgewise, because he's just, he just dominated the ball. Yeah. And afterwards we're in the green room and he comes up to me and he puts his arm around me. It's time, uh, I like you man. And, uh, I want you to cause it to have my magazine. And he had, he's got the magazine in his left hand. He's got his right arm around me and it's called, it's, it's, it's, uh, Ted Nugent's bowhunting magazine. He goes, no time. This magazine is more than about bow hunt. This is about you and who you are as a man and getting in touch with your inner being. I read the fucking magazines cover to cover. It was about bowling.

Speaker 1:          02:45:04       It had nothing to do with me. Well, let's see him. That's what bowhunting is about. Bow Hunting is about some spiritual quest, you know, to tap into the essence of the wall, the wilderness. Right. He does it with an Arrow. That's Kinda, that's old school. Well it is. He's a, I mean, he's really good at what does that song, oh, that's right. Why must we eat the animals? But that's right. This is a real video, by the way. This is a white guy and this is a Vegan reggae song. Oh Wow. And if this doesn't make you both laugh and want to get violent. Yes.

Speaker 4:          02:45:41       The beans up this way. The animals have language amenities that you got to see their videos to is off for cultivation or human bias.

Speaker 1:          02:46:07       Look at how fucking this is. Why must we eat the animals? When I was in this, when I was in New Zealand, there was a billboard for something. I don't know if it was a restaurant or something, but it's at a, if it didn't have a mother, it doesn't go on our grill. They won't even cook beans. They won't even grill Zucchini. Get the fuck Outta here with this guy's hilarious. And he's showing like things in this video that people don't eat like big whales. What's your rough Japanese people do hunt the whales and he's like the cow here. You know, here's the real problem with this philosophy. If you really did that, do you know how many people would get sick from poor nutrition? First of all, they already are, right? So that's a bad argument. But the real issue is what are you going to do with all these animals now?

Speaker 1:          02:47:08       Cause if you're not killing them, you better introduce some predators into the food chain because otherwise you're going to have deer everywhere. You weren't gonna be able to drive. You're not going to, your cows are going to be all over it. You're gonna keep him from fucking, you're going to castrate them. You gonna what are you going to do? How are you gonna? How are you going to neuter them? How you get to manage the population? Are you going to kill a few? What do you do then? And no need to meet? That seems pretty ridiculous when people are starving in the world and your ships and shipping and boxes of fresh vegetables that are rotting. My favorite sandwiches, the BLT, it's great. Sam, how are you going to, how are you going to in sandwich? You can take away bacon

Speaker 2:          02:47:37       dude. I been eating the fuck out of Bacon. Lightly big is good for you.

Speaker 5:          02:47:41       I went back to Baygon. Fuck yeah you did. I said I had like, my father was a baker and his stories, I like started getting Turkey Bacon and I was like, oh, this tastes good enough man. Fuck that. Good fat bacon like re like freshly sliced bacon. Not like the, the Oscar Meyer packs that you can buy your hard core. Your uh, yeah. You're the boars head at the Deli. You get that Bacon.

Speaker 2:          02:48:06       Do you ever get the bacon they have at the um, at whole foods? Yes. Oh yeah. You cannot bacon. You gotta go Rob Wolf style though. Dude. You get a cook it slow. You got to get a big frying pan and cook it slow. He doesn't unlike some electrical Jamey, but he cooks his bacon for like three hours. Yeah. But when you do it that way, like if you ever go to like a four seasons and you eat at the buffet and he get that Bacon, you're like, hell no. Fuck are they doing this? Cause my bacon is always fucked up. Twisted black. They're baking is like consistent and Perri a rich brown and it's so perfect. It's cause they're slow cook in that batch, cooking that pitch. Let me go get some bacon right now. It's podcast is over. Tom Rhodes, you're a bad motherfucker. Glad we're friends. I like to buy specs, respect and please let's do this more often. It's, yeah,
