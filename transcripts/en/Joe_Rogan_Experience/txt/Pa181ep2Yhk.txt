Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello Freak bitches. Now, the reason why that upsets me is because it's, it's, it's grants people a false sense of security and hope. You know Islam is wonderful, but we need to attack this separate thing called Islam Islam. Well from day one, 1400 years ago, Islam was Islam, Islam. Now that doesn't mean that there isn't a spiritual element. That doesn't mean that most Muslims just want to practice the spiritual part, but there is no set of doctrines and a separate book called radicalized Islam, Islam. It all comes from the same texts. It comes from the Koran, it comes from the Heidi's, and it comes from the Sierra, the biography of Mohammed, so, so this kind of false narrative that people are prominently gating so that they seem as though they're not frontally attacking a religion while laudable. While Nice, I get that reflex, it's false. And so again, to go back to our point of talking honestly, we need to talk.

Speaker 1:          00:58          Honestly, there's only Islam. Some people choose to practice it fully. Some people choose to ignore the ugly parts, but there is no such thing as Islamism. Islam. Islam is part of Islam. Now you're a person that goes out of your way to say, no, we're not talking about the kind sweet Islamic people that just want to raise their children now. So how do you sort of manage those two ideas that they're the same? Like when the term radical Islam gets thrown around, right? So radical Islam simply means I really take my Islam seriously, right? It's, it's. Let's draw us a silly analogy. If I don't eat pork, uh, my radical Jew, or am I a Jew right now, I happen to be Jewish. I simply ignore the kosher edict that says, don't eat pork. That's why do you do that though? Because in my case, I simply identify as Jewish in the sense that at Judaism is a multi attribute identity.

Speaker 1:          01:56          It includes a shared history, shared lineage, sh, sh kind of erase. It's what some could argue. It's array, so it's considered in a lot of people's ideas. So I could still in the same way that you might identify as coming from Boston and there's a shared history from all people who grew up around the time that you grew up in Boston and there was a sense of affiliation and tribalism, would that reality being Jewish as far as I'm concerned and for most Jews is exactly that. We don't necessarily take the religious elements very seriously. Now. That doesn't mean that we are practicing a light Judaism or non radical Judaism. We're simply ignoring those parts of Judaism that we choose to ignore. So there is no such thing as radical Islam. There are no books called radical Islam. There is a set of doctrines called Islam and then I could do what's called cafeteria Islam, which is I pick and choose the parts that I wish to adhere to.

Speaker 1:          02:52          So again, the discourse is a false narrative. I understand the reason for it because people find it rather Gauche to attack frontally it religion at least to attack Islam. So they have to. I call this the, the, the ISM magic eucharistic rite. You add ism to something. It makes it bad. Islam as good Islam, Islam is bad. Yeah. But that's, um, that's a characteristic that I see in almost everybody that I respect. They all think that everything they do socks or at least they have very, very high standards and an often disappointed by their own work. Well, you know, I think I have some of that, but I also have that idea of like, it's something that I've, I don't know if I talked about my dad with you, but um, he was my wrestling coach in high school. Uh, he was also my, uh, earth science biology and environmental studies teacher.

Speaker 1:          03:45          She was my teacher. Well, what a drag you went to school, your dad being the fucking. I learned a lot because he was no joke. He didn't pull any punches from me. He, you know, he drove me as hard, if not harder than his other students. He didn't show any favoritism, but one of the things that was always his thing on the mat, and I'm kind of paraphrasing, but basically you, you either win or you learn, especially in that high school college setting, you're, you're, you're learning about yourself. If you, if you went out there and you got your ass handed to you and you just got beat and didn't learn anything, well yeah, you're a fucking loser. Take the moment, reflect on it, build on what you did wrong and you now you're actually gonna. Wave one. Now you know more about yourself. You know about where your your limitations are, what you need to improve and expand your talents are your limitations.

Speaker 1:          04:38          So I guess whenever I'm doing a thing, I'm always looking at it from a learning perspective so there aren't necessarily mistakes unless they're fatal and then you wouldn't know anyway. So whatever that really is the right way to look at everything. You win or you learn. You know you have great experiences because you were successful or you have very beneficial experiences because you realized what went wrong. What is just one more wrinkle, one more piece of information or one more experience that you can add to your database of knowledge and it'll make you better at everything. So that, and a lot of ways, that's my biggest frustration in life is when there is something that Kinda goes wrong and I can't figure out what it was that's frustrating for me because I can't, I can't build on it. I can't learn from it, but I don't understand what went wrong, but whether it's a relationship or whether it's something I tried to build or something I did or how often does that happen? A lot, you know, you know, there's a couple of times I've actually had an opportunity to do, have a uh, vocal with somebody else as a guest singer and I know rehearsal was great and then you blew it for the, for the main event. And I'm like, what did I do wrong? I did everything the same. And until you can actually pinpoint that and figure out what it was,

Speaker 2:          05:59          I'm a fucking mess. Like I'm slipping. I'm waking up in the middle of the night trying to figure out what the fuck went wrong. And then when you're done with that, you've got to figure out a way to get that thing from dead deer to meet. And all the other things. So it's just so complex. How would you ever expect somebody to just to be, have like a desire. You were like that at some point.

Speaker 1:          06:17          Well, Rinella opened the door for me to have that super lucky forever grateful because when he took me into a wild back country, Montana. Yeah, you gotta get to the nuts. The first year it was a three breaks in the Missouri breaks in October, nine degrees out. Freezing your dick off every night and attend like lifeless Steven Ella. That's kind of. What was it? He loves suffering. He loves it. But I love that he loves it. He's legit as they come. He really is. I think that's it, right?

Speaker 2:          06:47          There is just this, there's this big gap. And my father got me into it, but I, my brother doesn't. Doesn't hunt and. But I think he has a respect for it and understands what's going on. But he just, I think at the time that I was introduced to hunting, my brother was more interested in going out with his friends and Saturday mornings were not for getting up early. And so we're essentially the same person, but I just went this way and he didn't go that way. Right. So it's a weird. So you could be in the same house with somebody in a different way.

Speaker 1:          07:16          Well, Rinella has a real good way of looking at it too. He's like, uh, I don't expect people to go out and get rid of their own sewage. Why should I expect them to go out and hunt their own food like you don't have to?

Speaker 2:          07:26          Well, and he's, I think he probably said this at some point, um, or somebody smart did. It was like I choose, I believe it. I choose to for meat to be the one thing that I grabbed ahold of to bring into my, to my skill set. I don't knit my own clothes. I don't, I don't make my own shoes. I don't build my own houses. You know, we were just looking at some construction stuff a little bit earlier. I'm like, dude, I don't know what. Yeah, what are they doing? What are they doing? Yeah. I couldn't do that. I just picked this one thing because it's also part of my passion, so you couldn't just ask someone who's a construction worker to go like, go hunt, get some meat. I know you have a desire for that, so that's just another hard part about hunting and and non hunters by proxy are essential to hunting always in industry and opinion and because we could legislate ourselves out of being able to hunt. That can happen. One is a privileged man. That's not a right and a lot of ways and so that's another whole nother can of worms, but it could. It could go away. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          08:27          I think the. The issue is that so many people are opposed to it because they're so removed from the realities of the wild and they just feel some sort of moral superiority by either not eating meat entirely or by not killing their own meat. The not killing their own meat is really ridiculous. Like my wife was having a conversation with someone. They were out to dinner with a bunch of people while I was on El con and the guy was eating a steak guy from England in England and will hunt or they've do these, these like foxes and

Speaker 2:          08:56          horses and shit, and they were like, tweed pussies, Kesari England. We love you guys carving a steak. And my wife goes, oh, he's actually out elk hunting. And the guy goes, he hunts. That's deplorable. The guy said, does deplorable. He's carving a steak, was saying something the other day. And I got. I got a lot of, like, people were looking at me like I was weird at work. Uh, one of my buddies at work was eating a chicken sandwich from chick filet and I look on the bag and there's a cartoon chicken on the bag. And in my mind I'm like, well, that's like building a swimming pool by the lake. That's fucking weird and irony that, that were like saying, Hey, I'm eating the chicken, but here's a cartoon version of it so we can celebrate the fact that we just murdered this chicken and we fried it up. Like that doesn't make sense like a swimming pool with a lake as smart because it's Paris.
