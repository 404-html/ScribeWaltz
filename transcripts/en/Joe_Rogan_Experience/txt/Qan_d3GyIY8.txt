Speaker 1:          00:00:04       The Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by the fleshlight. If you go to Joe Rogan.net and click on the link for the flashlight and enter in the code name Rogan, you will get 15 percent often. Number one, sex toy from men. Yay. Yay. As is in the house gritches Buckler Rogan experience. We're fitting to make shit happen.

Speaker 1:          00:00:38       I'm going to say that all the time. Now we're fend to do this friend to make shit happen. Don't even know where that came from. I don't know why it exists with Finn will fend to do this, but I like it. I'm a fan of were fin to. We're going to do this. I don't know what it means. You lost me on that. We fend to go do this podcast. Some guy tweeted me saying he doesn't like when I do a black force and to him I say tough shit. You're gonna. Have to deal with that. If there wasn't people that actually talk like that, you know, if I was doing that white guy voice that Richard Pryor always did, that never bothered me. It was like either Mr. so Mr Pryor, my, my mom, why she's a great old Gal. I guess there are a few people that talk like that, but there's a lot of motherfuckers who talked like my black voice. Okay. It's not like you have to go find them like, Gee Golly Gee Whiz, Gee Whiz, Gee whiz or maker. No, there's a lot of dudes will be like, we Finna do this podcast. That's not even ridiculous. That sounds exactly what a lot of black people sound like, but for whatever fucking reason, man, black, feeble are so super sensitive about just a little good natured joking around.

Speaker 2:          00:01:55       I, I got it. I got in trouble the other day. I went to our fi, like a five star restaurant called the Ritz. I don't know if you ever heard it, but it was like, like the most widest place ever. Like there was four waiters, one for just your glasses and they were all standing by your tables for my birthday. And I twittered a joke. Like, Oh, I really wish they would let black people in here. Ha ha ha. You know as a joke. And people got so fucking pissed off at me and I had to explain like, no, I was making fun of that. I was making fun how, how wide, how wide it was and how it was disgusting.

Speaker 1:          00:02:24       Yeah. People are Super God damn sensitive. I made one fucking joke and I think the joke was because there was something real obvious in the news. I forget what it was and my response to it was a. So they're telling us some shit that we already knew. Like what? What's next? You're going to tell me that many black people don't tip. You know? Which by the way, I'm not saying all but I'm saying many. I'm saying it's, it's a known thing that if you work in restaurants, a lot of times black people don't tip. If you're black and you tip, God bless Ya. You know, I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that, but I am from Italian descent. I'm Italian, Irish and I have said on many occasions that my people are fucking monkeys. Those fucking dummies, those wanna be soprano dummies. There's so many dumb Italian.

Speaker 1:          00:03:11       It is embarrassing to be Italian all the time. Italians make some bad ass food and there's a certain Robert Deniro, percentage of Italians that are bad motherfuckers. There's a few rocky Marciano's out there in the world, but by and large the great percentage of Italians are douchebags and that's me. That's me. We're just being realistic. Nothing wrong with that, but for whatever fucking reason I say this thing about black people tipping and people are calling me races and all this fucking shit. So this weekend I'm in Philadelphia, right? We're there for the UFC and I'm with my boy Tommy Jr and his girl Katie, and we get high as Jesus on the fucking space shuttle we got. We got down Joe Diaz. We went deep. We just kept smoking. Got To break up the we'd when I come up here though. What are you talking about that we don't do shit to me?

Speaker 3:          00:07:35       Don't talk about. We dogged out around me dog. I got, I got to Philly. Is that

Speaker 1:          00:07:42       cracked bell? Yeah, we're in Philadelphia. We, Tommy junior brings us Connecticut. We'd, I am thinking this is going to be just terrible. I don't think there's going to be useless, but it was, it was Joey Diaz style. Gee, Kush Endeca the shit that you used to smoke and we just go eight, nine, 10 hits deep to the point where we don't want to leave the balcony. Okay. We're terrified. We're out there and we're looking at and it's a beautiful summer night and um, you know, Tommy Jr is my boy. I've known him since I was like in my early twenties. And you know, his girl Katie is really cool and we're hanging out in. The three of us are just giggling or as I've gone, we're too high to go outside. We're so high. We so nervous and paranoid, but we're going to see planet of the apes. We had decided that the evening was.

Speaker 1:          00:08:23       I was looking forward to this weekend very much because usually on Friday night before the UFC, I always do a show. We always do a show somewhere, but this weekend I was just going to play pool with Tommy and Tommy, uh, texted me somewhere during the week. Dude, planet of the apes opens this week. Let's do that too. Like, fuck yeah, we gotta you know, for me, man, I've got kids, little babies and they constantly need supervision and I don't really get a chance to just go fuck off for a whole day. So this is, I do the, the, the uh, Wayne's are done by 5:00 and I'm hanging out with Tommy right after that. I do some UFC shit for like an hour and then we're hanging out. So were so high we can't, we can't think straight. We're just giggling, but little giggle, silly high. It wasn't like my kind of high where it's like thinking about Jupiter and you know, what happens if a planet hits another planet?

Speaker 1:          00:09:07       No, it's the, it's Joe Diaz style high. So we're giggling and we have a driver. Luckily I have this God taking us around, you know, like a big town car. But uh, you know, whatever those suv things. So the guy takes us to this movie theater, I go take us to whatever the good movie theaters in town, right? And he goes, well, the good movie theater is over here. And so it takes me to a super white neighborhood where all the movies are. Shit movies. It's all like foreign films, you know, those weird, those. What are those theaters call? Will you go there and you go, what the fuck is this movement to look for something that you recognize? But everything's alternative. I'm sure some of them are good, but I, I've seen some that everybody told me were good because they were alternative like, like fucking was ghost dog, whatever that Samurai one was with forest whitaker episode a good.

Speaker 1:          00:09:57       So amazing. It was such a piece of shit. It was such a dumb movie. And everybody's like, it's amazing because it's because it's an independent film. So it's one of these Lemley films. So anyway, we uh, we can't go there. So I go, you got to go to one where there's planet of the Apes, man, we're going to go see planet of the apes. So I look on the iphone APP and it says, okay, take me to this one. And the guy goes, okay, he goes out in a good neighborhood. It's like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Got Barely speaks English. He texts us there, we get out and we're giggling. Is he putting the names? We walk into planet of the Apes. We walked into Africa, did we? We walked in the door and there was no white people. There was no white people. We plan the act didn't take place in Africa.

Speaker 1:          00:10:38       I was a racist thing to say, but you see what I'm saying? What I'm saying is fine automatically stuck to your hands. What would happen is we walked into the blackest neighborhood we could find. I mean, it was, there was literally no white people. It was amazing and everybody was super cool, you know, it wasn't a negative experience. And this was something that I wrote on on twitter that, uh, we all went to see a planet of the apes in a black neighborhood and experience. I highly recommend all these fucking people started calling me a racist. I mean, dozens of twitter. People do what? I didn't know you were racist. Fuck you. Like black people were saying, fuck you. I'm like, listen man, I am saying it was a positive experience. It would sit on highly recommended and it was a black neighborhood and we get in there.

Speaker 1:          00:11:22       Right? And we're so we're so deeply heartbroken. And then I realized like, Whoa, everyone's black. You're like, well, I mean everyone's black. This is crazy. And then a bunch of people recognize me and they don't want to take some pictures and it's all good. Everybody's cool and friendly. Coolest shit. Cooler Shit. Like this guy goes, Yo man, I don't wait. I know you from. I don't want to. I don't want to bother you man. I'm not trying to use up your time. I know you from. I go, fear factor. I go, yeah, that's it. But it's the way you said it was like so cool and we're giggling. Oh no one did the smoke rocks thing, but it took a lot of God damn pictures and see, like I said, super cool, super friendly. This is not a negative story. So then we go into the movie theater, right?

Speaker 1:          00:11:59       It's me, Tommy, and like maybe there's another white person, maybe one other white person movie theater filled with black people and they are having a good fucking time. You know, people always complain that black people talk to the movie theater and talk to screen. Yes they do. Yes they do, but it's good. That's totally fucking. Yeah. If that's what you know. And so way I felt like I'm like, look, I'm in their neighborhood. This is how they go to the movies. Who the fuck am I to be offended by how they liked to go to the movies? They, they were at the movies and I'm not saying all black neighborhoods do this, but this particular black neighborhood, these people brought babies, bro. I mean there's a lot of people with babies. Yeah. I mean it wasn't just one. These, these people in front of us walked in and they had toddlers, like little two year olds sitting on their lap to see planet of the apes at like 10:40 on a Friday night.

Speaker 1:          00:12:46       Give a fuck. Fuck. Not, didn't give a fuck. But I'll tell you what made me really nervous and made me feel kind of weird, was watching all of these previews of all these different TV shows or all these different movies around them that are coming out and I'm watching these movies and all of them are about white people and I'm sitting there and I'm going, wow, this is weird. Like w imagined being a blank person. And I always thought like people would complain. Like I'd hear Black People Complain About, oh, there's no films for black people. There's no roles for black actors. And I'd be like, so you go make your movie, when do you want from me? You know? But when you go to a goddamn movie theater with all black people, that's when you really feel it. I'm sitting there in the audience and all these people are black, but every movie preview is white.

Speaker 1:          00:13:37       There's no black characters. And then finally there's this movie with Jonah Hill and they show a preview for the movie and it's Jonah Hill and he's doing all this different shit. He's babysitting kids, but he's supposed to be like a cool guy. And the way they show you who's he's a cool guy is there's an old black guy working like at a door at a club like the black guys there and Jonah Hill's talking black to them, you know, it is what it is, brother, it is what it is. And I'm watching this with all these black people watching this white guy talk like a black guy and I'm in this fucking theater film. And I'm like, and I'm high as fuck. I mean just barbecued sitting there soaking in this experience going, wow, this is fucked up. Like what? No one knew why black people are angry and they feel disenfranchised.

Speaker 1:          00:14:21       Like they're completely removed from the mainstream cultural experience in a lot of ways like that. There's a tiny percentage of black people that are included in movies. So finally planet of the apes place, everyone's white in the movie except the bad guy. The bad guy is a black guy. And I thought it was so strange and I'm. And not only that, he's a bad guy who owns this giant company and he has an English accent. It was like, not only is a, but it's like you couldn't have a brother from Philadelphia that figured out how to own this corporation. It couldn't be a guy. Even a brother that talks like a regular businessman type dude, you know, who's like, well, well we need to do is acquire this and you know, once we get that and then we'll be on moving and then we get in the forest.

Speaker 1:          00:15:05       No, no, no. This guy has an English accent. He doesn't sound like anybody, you know, and this is the only black guy in the fucking movie. And I'm like, wow. And then the rest of the movie is just bad ass monkeys. Just bad ass chimpanzees. So this was a CGI. Awesome. Was it? Oh my God is a good. First of all, the movie is good shit. Planet of the apes is a dope movie. It's a good movie for everybody. I think it's PG. 13 believer or not. Yeah, because the violence is all sort of implied like, you know what the fuck went down, but they don't really show it to you, but it's not removed from violence. It's a terrifying movie and the like, he, you know, I don't want to say I can't, I don't know. One of the old ones. Did you watch?

Speaker 1:          00:15:48       Oh, I watched all of it. All five. Watched all of them. And what'd you think of the first one is still sensation. It's. Well, you know, you have to put yourself back in the time because back in the time it was a great movie. It's like a lot of movies they don't hold up because you, you have to realize that culturally human beings have evolved in a shoot way from 1970 to 2011. I mean if you want any proof of that something is happening to our culture and that things are expanding and moving forward at an exponentially increasing way. All you have to do is look at old movies. Old Movies are almost unwatchable unwatchable. The abd concept is unwatchable. We don't last that long. Well, not only that, it's just not good. Like I watched altered states are trending ultimate states when I was in, you know, I, I'm captain isolation tank, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:16:38       I mean, I'm in that goddamn thing all the time and I got. I learned about the isolation tank from that movie. I learned about Iowasca from that movie. I learned a lot of Shit from that movie. That movie was a big fucking 84 or something like that. I think so. I'm just talking out of my ass. I'm guessing though, that again, altered states. It's not the Christopher Walken away takes no William hurt, right? It was in 1980 or even earlier than we thought. Thirty one years ago. Yeah, it's so bad. Or You fucking years ago and somebody needs to Redo that goddamn movie because that's a fascinating thing. Especially with Iowasca being so popular, you know, and isolation tanks were pretty God damn popular right now to footloose instead. I think it's amazing that isolation tanks a lot of wildly popular is us a lot of walls popular is talking about on the podcast and talk about it in videos, you know, that's incredible that no one is talking about one of the most amazing tools for the human mind ever created. And it's not like it's a fucking, you know, one of those things that they had to build in the movie contact and it cost a billion dollars. You need fucking cranes to put it into place. Now. It's so fucking simple. I mean there's directions for building these goddamn things on the Internet. Was the movie in Three d? Um, no, not, not the one I did.

Speaker 4:          00:17:50       I was not in three D. I don't know if it is in three d. I don't know. I'm not aware of what truly crazy, but it was awesome. My witness, we went to philly about 18 months ago, two years ago and we ran out of weed. If somebody gave us a joint on the way to the club and the same thing happened to us. So you don't fucking remember when we brought them. Need to fill this shit was probably less than what was the DJ gave it to us. It was one of the guys who works at the radio station and all four of us were like, we don't want no more and it's something that you really have to think about that I got to come out here and pay $300 an ounce and back. They're 1:25 and they get fucking bullets. Yeah, they, they're getting that, that indycar the craziest.

Speaker 4:          00:18:29       It's Brown and it's fucking strong. It's definitely a different highs. Definitely a different vibe that I got. Was that east coast high? It was, it's um, it's silly. It's a silly high and you don't like think we weren't thinking about the universe, but I was very sensitive to this whole situation, you know, it was like, you know, it made me feel like, man, you know what a black people have and they are fucking Tyler Perry, you know, they have Tyler Perry, that's their mogul. That's the guy who's making a lot of movies. And so these, Goddamn, I ate a movies. And what else does it. I mean, so there's not that many movies. Every three months they put out an all black funeral, which was horrendously bad. It's sad man. I mean for every spike. Lee, how many fucking real good. Every John Singleton, how many real good representatives for black people are there out there?

Speaker 4:          00:19:15       You know, it's Kinda, it's. It was really interesting to be in a black theater and you had a good. I had a great fall. You know what? I have a good time on Tuesdays. You want to have a good time with black people and I'm not being fucking prejudice for funny. I'm just. See if you want to see black people, their natural environment, you go to fucking Popeye's chicken on Tuesdays. They give you a wing and a breast for ninety nine cents and I made the mistake one night. I got to tell you, you want to go? I like Bob. I strictly what you love. Spicy, spicy. We had that at the end. I went to Popeye's chicken and it and it's a one on Laurel Canyon. Like if you go to Popeye's chicken around Hollywood and it's full of full of brothers name, nothing you could do, but Laurel Canyon, you ain't going to be a brother.

Speaker 4:          00:19:54       I didn't even think about it, but either way and I'd been there before on a Sunday at least a special. It's a wing and a breast for ninety nine cents dog. They'd come out of the woodwork for this path when you understand me around the corner, but the best ones I've seen a real mother fucking gangster brother. This guy, 8:20 pieces of chicken and didn't get off the phone. Now one flip and time. That's a real bad motherfucker. The only time he got off the phone was as the bitch for hot sauce and still sat there and watched the whole certificate on the bones are breaking them in half while he was on the phone to call his bitch out. Fuck it. I'm getting my. Another thing that people got mad at me for, for asking, why is it that I keep seeing black dudes talking on speakerphone out loud by themselves. I see it all the time and public black dudes holding the phone. The next phase go yo what it is. Oh, okay. And they're talking on the phone when it's not near their face.

Speaker 2:          00:20:49       We talked about this once, but my ex people got mad at my ex girlfriend does that too?

Speaker 4:          00:20:53       She's black. Will add so much flavor flavor to the world. Oh, if it wasn't for these fucking black people would just be a bunch of cowboys on oysters listening to fucking think about white people from Utah. They fucking entertaining drove my wife this morning at 7:00 you had to go get a blood test assumptions done at Kaiser on the way back. I cut back to two and I went to North Hollywood park. You ready for this one? This is food for thought. There wasn't a soul in Hollywood park, north Hollywood park, but black people teach them karate, north Hollywood park. Beautiful Park. You know those squirrels will let you feed them. Oh, please. It's a beautiful fucking part is a dude and Chinese dude that sits out there with a bag of squatting back at Magnolia to hunting their dog. That's a great fucking dog dog dog talk.

Speaker 4:          00:21:37       His language guy sits out. This Chinese guy sits out there with a fucking peanut and he'll just have a bag of m and he lies on his back and he puts his hands out and those girls come up and they just hang out with that dude. They take the things like they don't even run, didn't even back up before they eat. They eat right there. They just take it right from them. That's a great fucking park. It's one of my favorite color is black dudes doing karate. Karate sticks doing forms, but they're out there doing motherfucking karate. Only brothers go to and you really want this. There's two movies I've seen. The black movie dealer was the one movie was rambled too. I told you the other day, but the best movie ever. I seen the one about the black. What's the guy when he comes?

Speaker 4:          00:22:18       I'm the black show gun to Harlem. I've seen that in Harlem and last Dragon Dragon was entertainment like I'm sure that's a great movie. This headache. If I ever make enough money, I would just buy a black. We didn't just go there and laughed my ass off, fucked up, and you go over to this one. What's this one on sunset? The atrium. What's that one $90 to go to the movie data's quite fucking dollars. I went last year 20 tool and for 50 for a sausage sandwich and I just want to see a fucking movie guide's $90 of the food that I just want to see a fucking movie.

Speaker 2:          00:22:52       I worked new Jack City opening night in Columbus, Ohio. One of the scariest movie theaters.

Speaker 4:          00:22:56       You don't want to go to a. This is the difference. You don't want to go see a gangster black neighborhood. No, definitely want to go see a martial arts martial arts film or an action film

Speaker 2:          00:23:06       to sit in the back of the theater the whole time and watched that movie because it was like midnight opening night. New Jack City. I'm sitting in the back. I'm a white general manager. All my staff is black and so I'm sitting there like, what is this new Jack City movie? Watch the head, the watch, the whole thing, and there was fights. There was one time where this lady started hitting this other lady and went into the hallway and I had to like kick him out. It was the one that the most scariest moments of my life work in that movie and one of the best movies ever saw too, so.

Speaker 4:          00:23:34       Well one of the best ones that houses I had but went to, we went to Asbury park for Halloween to a haunted mansion, the city of North Bergen, rented buses and they took you to different places and we went down and they, this thing, the Brigantine Casper, I think I told you already. We went in there and you know, they got Dracula and Frankenstein when you walk around and boom, I supposed to get scared bro. We had to beat like maybe 12 and a half and you know, you got a little scared. We didn't smoke dope that or not. Then we just walking around. But Bro, that Dracula bumped into a Black Dude Dracula. He said, what the fuck you and these guys were from east orange. That was the other time that was. And this guy looked at him. He was like, what the Fuck is wrong with Dracula motherfucker? They started beating the fuck. They were 12 just like us. We thought we were bad.

Speaker 1:          00:24:21       They started

Speaker 4:          00:24:25       get to them like 16 little black dudes. I never laughed so hard in my life that they fucked dracula. By the time I got out, the cops were there and nobody could cop to it. They had the kids with their hands up against the wall. You don't fuck with it.

Speaker 1:          00:24:37       It takes a broad spectrum of people to make this world interesting. You know? And that is true that if you look at like our culture, first of all stand up comedy, you know, besides Lenny Bruce, the number one contributor is black comics. Richard Pryor, you know, in later years, Eddie Murphy, Eddie Murphy contributed and Chris Rock, they're the real greats. You look at music, there's so much black music, so much black influence on led Zepplin even on fucking Leonard Skinner, man, you know, Lennon skinner, they were influenced by a lot of black guys. That fucking song, the ballot of Curtis Loew Amazing. I'm writing song about a black guy in the south who's teaching them how to play the blues, you know, or playing the blues form when he was a little kid at. It's. It's a. It was a fun experience. We had a great God downtime at that movie. Did. It didn't matter.

Speaker 1:          00:25:27       There was babies talking. It didn't matter because that was, that was the, that was the experience that we signed up for and I'll tell you what, man, Ilana dudes saying Shit and made the movie better. There was one scene with the do goes, oh, he running shit now. And everybody started laughing. Diane, they started shyman in with their own shit and the women were talking to each, oh, he'd be like this, look at that. Motherfucker was happy and it was just back and forth and it went on for a few seconds where as long as everybody thought it was acceptable and then the movie kept going, but it was. They made the movie louder. The movie was really loud and I was wondering like, I wonder, they may get loud because people talk in the movie theater a wonder because it was loud as fuck, but it was such an action movie that there's not a lot of moments in that movie that where there's like, you need quiet, you know, the movies are good goddamn movie man.

Speaker 1:          00:26:17       They did it good. Like I was wondering, you know, it was like, well I bet the CGI will be cool, but maybe it would be corny. Like I didn't like cowboys and aliens. I went to see cowboys and aliens and it was good. It was a good movie. I mean I didn't hate it, but it was like kind of all over the road and I'm a huge fan of Jon favreau and I thought that Ironman was fucking awesome and I just love him. Anyway, I love him from swingers and I've met him a couple times and he's super cool. So it was really looking forward to it and I, I love a good alien movie and I love a good cowboy movie. I'm like, this is going to be perfect. So I was kind of expecting that that planet of the apes would kind of be like, that sorta was probably a lot like that level.

Speaker 1:          00:26:53       No way, dude. It was a strong nine strong, nine out of 10. The fucking. First of all, you realize how pathetic and fleshy human beings are when you see like [inaudible] they, they dead. These chimps, super realistic. You know, and you think of like a super athlete, like a Ray Lewis, you know, like, think like a brock Lesnar, like the biggest, strongest super athlete, human. And you'd look at what like a hundred and 50 pound chimp does in this movie. She has run shit, throws things around. Like the way he handles people was so realistic. It was really, it was really fucking well done, man. The CGI you're watching it, you could still come to town that it's not really a champ, but only in the face. Only like the ways face moves for the one that was like real human, like just a little bit. I mean I hair, they're so close, but the gorilla God damn the gorilla looks good.

Speaker 1:          00:27:50       There's some scenes where this gorilla shows up, the gorilla just run shit, but I don't want to tell you anymore. I can't tell you anything. No spoilers, but just the way they did it, they'll fucking the way they're able to have these artificial things interact with what looks like a real physical environment like this, jump this gorilla smashing things and it looks real as fuck, man. It looks real as fuck, but you're getting a a gorilla to do some shit you could never get a real gorilla to do. You couldn't get a real gorilla that act exactly the way you want it, but that's what it looks like. It's going to be crazy as in five years when you rewatch that movie, it's gonna look shit like shit like going to see I am legend. That stupid scene where the lions walk out like as fake gas line.

Speaker 1:          00:28:30       It ruins the whole movie for me. Like I think they shouldn't have had that scene because that line looks so stupid. Like I can't believe they accepted that stupid looking fake line. This is not like that. This is way better than that. This is the next level. This is next level shit. It's a good plot to. It's well made. It's well directed. It keeps you fucking captivated. It's a perfect summer movie. Best summer movie next to red state. I went to see red state last week. I went to Kevin Smith, invited me to go to a screening and I sat right next to mark Marin, which is another of kiss. We did. We hugged, we did dog. We made up. We made up. He actually apologized because uh, you know, I talked about on the podcast. He's so fucking negative. I'm like, why you say you know, what the fuck man.

Speaker 1:          00:29:14       And that we went over some shit on the podcast. He totally copped to it. And so you're right, I apologize, I'm sorry. And we were cool like right away and he looked really happy too, is with this really pretty girl. His girlfriend girls real pretty and he's doing real good now. Just got back from Chicago. He's telling me sold out these shows. So he felt like real good. So he felt good. He looked good and you know, it's like people just need some, some success. They just need some happiness in their life, you know, now he's got a girlfriend and she's really pretty and she seemed really nice and obviously love each other together. All Nice. So it's like good, good love. So you got some love now and now you want to give the love back? Yeah. Terrific. Anyway, redstate is fucking bad ass.

Speaker 1:          00:29:52       Kevin Smith made this movie, right? He didn't tell me Shit about it. You. So dude, I really want you to see this. I know you'll dig it. Okay. I'm, he's a real nice guy. He's going to do. He's doing the podcast next week. It's super nice guy. I did his podcast. I love men. And before I love the guy, he's. I love him. His movies that I've seen there. There are always these silly comedies, you know, so I'm expecting, I'm going to go see a Kevin Smith movie. It's going to be a silly comedy. We get there. It is this apocalyptic like cult, this cult that believes that Jesus is coming and that's what the movie's all about. And how they interact with a bunch of people. I don't want to tell you anymore about it, but it's about this religious fanatic. It's like basically it's basically a horror movie, you know, it seems like it's kind of like, it's an action movie, but it's really like a horror movie.

Speaker 1:          00:30:41       And God damn is it good. I mean, is one of the best movies I've seen in fucking years better even than planet of the apes as good as I said, of the aim. Redstate is slightly better. It's good. Stephen Root. Rude, isn't it? Stephen Root is fucking bad ass in this movie, man. And the dude who plays the, um, the dude who plays the, uh, the guy, um, I don't want the fuck is his name. The dude who plays the, um, there's a guy who plays the um, John Goodman's in it too. I don't know who the other guys they're appointed in the movie where John Goodman and goes, no. Michael Parks, that's the guy's name. Who plays the, uh, the, the bad guy. Fuck, is this guy good? I mean, he's, he's a guy who's been around a long ass time. Apparently it's got some crazy ass stories, um, about dudes trying to kill him.

Speaker 1:          00:31:33       John John hurt is that guy's name stamp. Kevin's friends was telling me, he was like, y'all got to tell you the whole story later. But this guy is famous actor, like literally tried to kill this dude twice, but this guy plays the. He plays the preacher in this movie. God Damn, that's good. John Goodman's in it. God Damn is he good? There's no soundtrack to this movie. So during the movie, what I loved about it, one of the things I love, I hate when a movie gives me. I mean, I loved the planet of the Apes. Don't get me wrong, it's a well packaged, entertaining vehicle. It's good, but I don't like when a movie plays me some fucking music and tells me how I'm supposed to think. I don't, that's, that's retarded to me. I've never enjoyed it. I'll tolerate it, you know. But I always feel relieved when a movie doesn't have any music, you know? I don't need like the, they start kissing and fucking violence play, get the fuck outta here. Obviously there's good examples and bad examples, but there's definitely some movies that the soundtrack is 90 percent of the movie [inaudible] I disagree. I don't like it. I don't mind it all and that's different man. You're talking about. It's like some music with songs and

Speaker 5:          00:32:40       singing and shit. I like to. I don't mind when I hear led Zeppelin houses of the holy. I know it's 74. That's. I don't mind, but I don't like what you're saying when you hear music to people dressing and them telling you. You know what I'm saying? In the time period I said it wrong because it's not that I don't like soundtracks because I do in goodfellas. I like it when it's done the right way. That's what I'm saying. He accepted up as a boogie nights. I don't mind that your book, like you remember when the rolling stones or plan and he's coked up and he's got a bag full of guns in the trunk and he's driving around in that movie. It works. What I mean more is the werewolf is running through the woods and you hear the fuck out of here with that.

Speaker 5:          00:33:29       Stupid Shit that drives me nuts. I told them, there's no music in this movie, man. This music is. This movie is brilliant. It's kept you and Kevin Smith describes it as his talking dog movie. He's like, because if a dog started talking, he'd be like, what the fuck? And he goes, that's exactly what this movie is like. You don't expect it from Kevin Smith. Did you see an early cut of it that they know it's done. It's done. It's done. The movie's done. Kevin did it all himself. He's going to release it all himself. He did it all himself. No, no one else had any involvement in it. And that's the brilliant. The brilliance of this movie. He didn't, you know, he was gonna do a mass release of it, but I guess it was just too expensive. So he's going to release it in a limited way just so that it's, it's, um, uh, eligible for the Oscars and then they're going to do it video on demand I think in September.

Speaker 5:          00:34:15       And you know, you can get it on DVD and all that shit. I'm sorry. It was a really weird thing, Joe Rogan, that you mentioned that I have to stick up for this for the seventies timepiece though, when we watch a movie and it trump seventies now, it's unbearable to watch, but if you really. Not always though, except for the Godfather, there's a bunch of movies that are still good, like a hard time. You could watch maybe if it's not 11:00 ever see friends of Eddie coyle. Tremendous. Tremendous. This fucking movie. I got turned onto that bike. Anthony. I'm Anthony Bourdain. No reservations. Well, if I showed you a bother you when I saw bad ass move, I just wanted and I thought fuck it. Movie Theater. I just went about a month ago. They had it for. I like movie. I always go to the dog or where's this place?

Speaker 5:          00:34:59       The place in beverly. Beverly. Beverly. I go there when you can't find me. I'm at the bellboy for five bucks, Bro. I ain't got time to waste with people no more. I go to the back. All those memories. I want to see him on the big screen. Yeah, the friends. Eddie quote, look at the cast in. They're great. What's the name of the storming that, bro. How bad is it? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. What's his name was Eddie coils name that guy to me. He reminds me for some reason. Got a laugh. He just like a brock Lesnar, but the way he talks to people, Bro, the way he would talk to people in the Robert Mitchum the fuck the size of his hands. Have you seen the dude that's a big motherfucking country bumpkin that. But you want me to tell you something about the seventies. Tell me something about the seven years

Speaker 4:          00:35:38       old. Better movies came out and in the seventies really let's get down every which way, but loose. No, let's just talk about the excesses because father, let's just talk about planet of the apes because Bro, let's get down to first. I came from I what? Rocky. Rocky. I came from Cuba and the first movie, one of the first one was I went to see was beneath the planet of the apes. At the time I lived on 88th street and Broadway. Fuck. All these motherfuckers. If you look beneath the planet of the apes, they were under the subway systems really in New York City. Look at beneath. You got to start from scratch. Dawn, you're not going to send me the planet x unless you start from scratch. I don't have to sell it to fucking awesome. You don't remember the part where you can torture yourself by not going to say I'm going to go see it, but what I'm trying to say to you is you have to watch that again.

Speaker 4:          00:36:22       I've seen it. I just haven't seen in years. You got to check yourself. That's all. I'm [inaudible] 70, 19, 70. When they put their mask off, I came home and I remember telling my mom, mom, these apes live under the fucking subway. Like they sold me on it. It's all through New York number. They get by the Statue of Liberty member. That shot did flux. CGI, CGI. The Statue of Liberty backed over. And then what's the blond guy number? The first one with the girl. Come on guy. What's the fruit? The gap. Get the girl out, a hot girl that couldn't even fucking clock and he was running Jane Fonda. No, no. The first one killed it. It was 1970. Everybody's mad at over Vietnam. Still rose to planet of the apes. Raquel Welsh. No baby. I don't think so. First Raquel was. We wouldn't be it right now. Is the frozen right now. Everybody would've been jerking off the depths. You 1968. What was the original chicken? That chicken that couldn't. Kim Hunter, Bro. I don't know what it was. But next time you get a minute, just watch the first two again. Get really.

Speaker 2:          00:37:23       You're giving me the gimbal. Ever see that movie? I returned to the valley of the dolls are. What the fuck is wrong with that movie? Is that Jane Fonda? Was that? No, it wasn't Jane Fonda. It was written by Roger Ebert. Ebro. Yes. You fucking did it. I sat there and seriously tried to follow that movie. That makes zero sense.

Speaker 4:          00:37:40       Hunter was one of the monkeys. It's Linda Harrison. She's the bad ass bitch. Oh God damn. Is She hot? You got to watch the first two, bro. I'm sorry, the Heston is a bad motherfucker too, and he's like 50.

Speaker 2:          00:37:53       Did you know Robert Herbert wrote a movie

Speaker 4:          00:37:55       and it's one of those stories so bad in the whole entire was. Of course it is and that's why he's a critic. Listen, I've always said this. I've met some good critics. I met some cool people who are fans of movies and there's no hard fast rule to anything. There's a lot of people like Doug Benson might as well be a critic. He's a huge movie, but he's still a very good comic, but he's a. he's a huge movie, but he might as well be a critic, but most critics are critics because they got nothing to contribute. That's why they don't want to be critics. They really want to. They want to be writers. They want to be screenwriters. You want to be authors. They don't have anything to say. I don't believe critics. Anyway, sometimes it wrong.

Speaker 2:          00:38:30       God, I thought I saw Doug Benson said that he hated that the new planet of the apes movie didn't fun at the CGI.

Speaker 6:          00:38:36       Everything. Let me just start with that. For the Dragon, which is one of the greatest martial arts films, all those seven of these movies, all those clint eastwood movies, all those jobs, Bronson movies that were stealing from today that we're remaking all those westerns. Westerns were in the seventies. So the time piece was fucking brilliant that the thinking was brilliant. It's not these momos knowledge. Just remaking shit.

Speaker 5:          00:38:57       What is the clinics would movie where he plays a ghost to comes back to town. It fucks everybody. Puts the shield on at the end and they can shoot the body because the people don't shoot the head. So every time they shoot the body he fall down and get back up. No. Yeah, that's the one. He's a western. Yeah. So they think he's dead. No, no, no, no, no. Dad came back to town to kill everybody. Oh my God. Which one is that? He came back to town to kill the whole 10. They whipped him to death and he came back and he was raping bitches. Dude, he raped this one chick and it's really kind of crazy. Like the way they show it, it was a real super realistic pitch in every movie. He always told them what time it was. He raped her and he, he like, he only fucked her for like four pumps and I watched it with my friend John wants my friend John in New York and he goes, see that's how we're supposed to fuck. We're not supposed to fuck a girl for an hour and make her come. You're supposed to just fuck four times and shoot your low because that's what feels good. And I was like, Whoa, how crazy are you

Speaker 6:          00:39:56       dude? I am not Doug Benson at some other comic. And I was really surprised because he was the only person I saw that, that didn't like that movie. Everyone was talking

Speaker 5:          00:40:05       high plains drifter. It's a bad motherfucker right there too. That's what it is. That's the one when they whip them. You're right. You're absolutely right. I Bro, you know, I got so many of those classics and that's not in the high plains. Drifter is another one. God Damn it. What the fuck is the movie driving me nuts, Ramos? Shit, I can't. It's Rick Grandma, so master of Queens. Really, so one of us would have people would let us know this for the good, the bad, the ugly for a few dollars more. A fistful of dollars in high plains drifter. It's got to be one of those. Maybe this high plains drifter. What's the one? What he paints the town red paint the town white. That's it. The paint. The town red. When was the last time somebody painting the town red in the last 20 years and you've seen the movie? Nobody. That was the original idea. Ever paint this fucking. What did he call the town to help? Yeah. I'm. This isn't. This is not the movie because in this one it says a stranger rides out of the hot desert into a small town in the wild west towns. People are scared of him and three gunmen try unsuccessfully to kill him. He takes her room and decides, Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Yeah. This just weird.

Speaker 6:          00:41:10       Veered into a summary and they kill them. M One m one will they shoot them and the people that shot him only shoot the body that don't shoot. The head isn't hanging high, so he fucking gets a shield and he builds a shield and he puts on his chest and then when he approaches the people they would shoot at him, but he was thinking, I think confusing movies. Yeah, we're confusing. All of them were confusing movies. Just go home and put on tonight. I

Speaker 4:          00:41:34       got them all on my own.

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       I have a great movie for you guys. Both the watch. It's a documentary, a tiff, tiffany stockers. Have you heard of it? It's called. I think we're alone now. It follows two guys that are a stock stockers of tiffany current stock or current stockers and one of them was the stalker like like 20 years ago or 15 years ago when she, when she was really young and stuff and one guy is a transsexual or transgender guidance deal going through being becoming a woman and the other guy they both have ass Berger's disease or whatever it's called and it's just like in the autism spectrum. Is that what that is? Yeah. It's like they're super, super smart, but they can't shut up about it, you know, like I can't stop talking about it and obsessing about whatever it is. Coke, smart people and smart people on Coke.

Speaker 2:          00:42:21       But it is so interesting and the fact that they're both are backup like they were both like, oh yeah, if I would never be able to marry her, but I, Alyssa Milano on the other hand and both of them had like a backup. Alyssa Milano. Yeah. And it's so weird. It's on Netflix streaming. I, they all love Tiffany, but they couldn't marry her but they can marry Alyssa. Alyssa Milano was or more realistic girl that they both were obsessed about it. It's more realistic. Tiffany. Yeah. Tiffany is married now or something and they went through. I have no idea. Yeah, well I don't know, but it's good. So it's called, what is it called? Very creepy and very fun to watch. It's called. I think we're alone now. She's running after it was over. There's another movie all about Dolly Parton stockers, I forget the name of it, but there's five Dolly Parton stockers and I will watch that too. And it's also good. So tiffany at the other one's about Dolly Parton too. So,

Speaker 4:          00:43:15       um, high plains drifter is the movie that is the more it comes back as a ghost and he kills everybody. They killed him. They whipped him to death that I was in the seventies of all time. Can't even fuck with it. Warriors fucking. You can't even fuck with it. The list goes on. Can't even fuck with it. Fuck box office. I'm talking about creativity. Yeah. There was. Once you know, the getaway with McQueen was out. All the Charles Bronson, great ones we've done in the seventies. All those movies were original. These dumb fucks to the edges. We making shit. He's Momos with their fucking things are going to see it go from shale writer. I wouldn't go see none of that shit gone. I don't go. None of that shit. Any of these movies that come up, nothing. Not that I'm going to go see planet of the apes because I'm a planet of the apes guys since 1970.

Speaker 4:          00:43:58       I'm going to go give it a chance. But besides that, the all of these movies, I wipe my ass with them. All of them. Well, I think something that was going on in the seventies, same was going on with music. You know, I've been on this lennon skinner kick for the last month, or I listened to Leonard scanner like every fucking day. I'm in my cd right now. Every most, every day since I bought that CD. I've been breweries. It's brilliant. It's brilliant. And the story of what they do. Don't, don't ever Mark Leonard Skinner. You Suck fucking weezer. Listen, this is garbage. It wasn't just say music today is so fucking bad for the fucking black keys and fucking the foo fighters and later everybody else could suck my dick because it's garbage. It all sounds the same. Fucking black keys. Throw that on. They got a video of them motherfuckers playing at Tennessee at a fucking record store.

Speaker 4:          00:44:51       Go ahead and put it on airplane. A fucking drum that's town. The foo fighters, everything else, all these kids send me these videos. I look at these guys redoing black Sabbath. You can't redo black sabbath. Bitch can't redo black sabbath. They'll oasis to always just suck my dick dog. They ain't the fucking racists they can do. Did Black Sabbath, whatever the fuck it is, they can't touch what's going on. What we grew up with, garbage with. The black keys are as real music musicians. That's where the real music. Now the music industry is dying and they could blame it all they wanted to be. Nobody wants to go see these people live in your magical. I love Rihanna, but it's 45 minutes of dead time. If you go see Rehab, please don't stop the music and the others song just standing there watching somebody sing over a fucking music.

Speaker 4:          00:45:36       There's no instruments on stage and that's half of these shows. Well, it's also recession, man. It's hard to sell tickets. Music is music where the eagles play last year for 3:50 place was sold into the three nights. Fuck the recession. Music is music statuette all these old time. Is it coming back? Because the new kids can't perform live. Really? Go look at your schedules. Everybody's back. Even Steve Miller's, his grandson came. You could go on stage and say you're Steve Miller and no one would know the difference. So nobody knows who steve fly like an eagle browse genius. Jungle. Love jungle. Listen to the fuck that motherfucking Steve Miller had to do the what? Oh yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:46:21       Why tucked that? Not More? Yeah, he was genius man. Steve Miller is the only guy who made it famous, made huge hits, and he just never got fucking picture. Why would you? I know there's pictures of her, but you know what Mick Jagger looks like, man. It's unmistakable. Mick Jagger walks into a restaurant. You fucking go, Oh shit. Mick Jagger's here. Steve Miller can go to target and his underwear and no one knows that's true, right? That's weird. What the fuck was going on in the seventies that led to this big creative explosion? I mean the sixties and the seventies and good acid. No bullshit asset. You had a brilliant bullshit when you're reading and music outdoors here. Whenever the fuck they on what you can't use, your eating laxatives and was a cough drops because it was pure. The people were pure little less time to fucking take off their mind. We have all this garbage that take up our mind to creativity was more listened to and everybody was great from Jimi Hendrix's shit. Jimmy Hendrix pulled out, listen to the cutting edge shit. Fucking Leonard Skinner put and I was cutting edge. There were, let's face it, let's get down to. Basically they were fucking rednecks guy from Florida. Yeah. You want me to some other rednecks. Put the allman brothers. Not put all of those bands on. These guys had nothing to lose. They had nothing to lose, Bro.

Speaker 5:          00:47:42       Joe, you know what you need to do. You need to do an info commercial for one of those cds like the songs that are seventies. Fuck.

Speaker 4:          00:47:47       You need a lesson? Two, hands down. It's hands down. It doesn't even compare. You can't even compare. You haven't heard. I haven't heard what lady Yankee Yankee albums. They can't cut the spread bro. They can't do it. Look at the whole 90 fucking albums, led Zeppelin, pink floyd, put out four albums in a role that most bands could never even release. Flood Piper and the gates of dawn and all that noise. What is that? Just that's their first time, which just freaky things. People hidden cow bells and shit. They go for acid heads and that shit was great. Listen, go, hit yourself in the head with a fucking habit. Wasn't glue but metal, dark side of the moon, animals but war. It's something that no abandons ever come out with five items in a row like how beautiful his dark side of the moon to where every song flows into the next flows and it saying that to do asset to that. He's the prettiest thing in the world because pink floyd did something that nobody else did. They tap into your soul when you do acid, if you listen to all the music and always has the boom, boom, boom, boom, go book.

Speaker 5:          00:48:56       I got molested. The comfortably Numb, but really? Yeah, but it's 21 year old girl lived up the street. You got molested a girl also. I was 13. She was 21, she was in town slut, she molested everybody on that. She didn't do much, just kinda grabbed my dick, but it was like, Whoa, that's just the. But it was crazy because she had like A. I think I've told this story before. She had a grown man who was a boyfriend. He had hair on his chest and shit. I was a little boy. I was 13, but this girl was all kinds of fucked up. But she turned me onto a lot of seventies music man. This crazy bitch was into. She was into Zeplin. She turned me on to black dog and she turned me onto a comfortably numb,

Speaker 4:          00:49:31       not like pink floyd passage shit. That's what they were doing. Everything that everybody talked about. All these people that wrote books on acid, they did it through music, which everybody could suck my dick. That's globally. We're talking about drugs and psychedelics.

Speaker 5:          00:49:43       This is a great story about, um, Roger Waters in rolling stone that I read. He was on the cover because you know, he's making a comeback. Yep. Yo. Fuck

Speaker 4:          00:49:51       that. And then backed off and watch what happens next. You see if there's a recession, so that if they charged 3:50 without David Gilmore, that's going to be a $500 ticket Gilmore, and let's see if there's a recession for them. DNC, about that record. Sales of the recession. There's no recession for good. That's 30 years, but war was a masterpiece 30 fucking one years ago. It's like doing your rack 31 years and never writing a joke. Well, they hit, they hit a high. That is almost like a level of perfection. Perfection like that song time. Perfect Shit. It was just on and on my way up here. Take the makeup in the world. It's about the four people live in the world. Sheep, pigs and fucking bugs. That's it. That's what we are. Sheep, the pigs or the politician and the dogs. The motherfucker that sling Dick, the rest of them are fucking sheet and they got three types of sheep. And that's the name. That's what the album is about. It's three types of sheep for fucking sheet. People think everything's cool and oh, Lou Reed, three types.

Speaker 4:          00:50:55       One of these done. Uh, I did that walk on the wild side already, five fucking yellow and Lou Reed is good for pretending your pool if you like, literally a cool Blue Ridge and Inga Rafa law, you know cousins? Yeah, he lives in the East village man. Walked round with a leather jacket or a leather jacket and smokes camels 30 fucking years. And I'll tell you what, that one song is, walk on the wild side a bad. You know what? But tomorrow when I leave here tonight, I want you to go on youtube and just press Lou Reed knows it and I want you to hit three songs with Lou Reed and call me. Somebody tried to convince me that iggy pop was really good. You got to listen to achy problems with the stooges and he plays. He sends me this link. So I go and click on this link and listen to this fucking song.

Speaker 4:          00:51:38       I'm like, this is so uncoordinated. It's all over the place. I mean maybe if you were a big ass iggy pop fan already, maybe if you liked it already and he got into this style of. But then I get that way about like some music that people go nuts for like the dead. I don't understand the data. It doesn't. A few of their songs are I think are really good, but a lot of it just doesn't ring with me and I think it's like a frequency that I'm just not tuned into that other people are. I went to see him and they run with me until I smelled those motherfuckers, the smell of those filthy fucking animals. And I looked in boulder, which collaborate those they were everywhere when I left being an army brat and hair and asked like some people just don't want to pay.

Speaker 4:          00:52:20       But the deadheads it was like ass and feet and fucking Brett and ears. Who has stinky fucking is besides the German shepherd. Those fucking dead heads. I think he is. I want to see the data you smell in there. I've been with. Next time you had a concert at red rocks. I went to see the dead Santana and public enemy. Oh God. That was scheduled dead Santana and public enemy of black people with guns and a bunch of stinky people with no fucking soap and somebody actually shot a gun at the fucking constantly. Benefits were crazy. Holy Santana came on and did a black magic woman dog and it was little off even that. Even that. Listen to the abraxis. Get yourself the first or the second Santana job. Listen to that brilliance. This fucking Mexican kid cook took a guitar and trying to fucking rock music and he mixed it with Spanish music and those first two albums are brilliant.

Speaker 4:          00:53:14       Oh yeah, go bovine fucking black magic woman is what the fuck happened. That one dude that made that really successful song with him recently, like within the last 10 years, just the underdog or what is that song? That's Rob Thomas from matchbox 20 where what happened to the fucking sing a great fucking writer. I mean that dude is bad. That dude made all those songs, wrote songs for a bunch of people and I think matchbox broke up and then he went and did that song with Santana. I think matchbox put another house. He put a pretty nice. It wasn't a bad single lab, you know that song,

Speaker 1:          00:53:50       that song was Santana? No, goddamn. It's one of those songs where it's like the perfect harmony of his voice and Santana and [inaudible]. Santana was one of those dudes that he put out a Santana song and I had to figure this out when I was a kid and I was like, wait, this is a different dude singing. Every time it was like, I don't get it, and then I realized, oh, it's not even a bad. He's such a bad motherfucker. It's not even about the singer. It's about the guitarist. It said one dude Carlos Santana, his shit is so tight and so bad ass that who had no matter who the fuck is saying it. Yeah, it's a Santana Song pitch you this the vocals and the song itself almost plays second fiddle to that God damn guitar. Now what a amazing dude that guy is because who the fuck else can claim that? There's like. I guess there's a few other guys that do that, like, like

Speaker 4:          00:54:40       be like a black wall was a back. What's his name? Dave? Well, they forget to fucking Jeff. Jeff, Jeff Beck.

Speaker 1:          00:54:50       Jeff Beck was another guitarist who can put out songs that weren't really Jeff Beck. I mean it was, it was called a Jeff Beck Song, but it was just because of his.

Speaker 4:          00:54:58       He was an egotistical motherfucking invaded that jam. Would Rod Stewart early in the morning? I can't sleep. Remember down there. That was a great factuation yeah, it was him. And then he canceled before the fucking tour. Once he left Rod Stewart go out there alive without a guitar because he's an ego maniac. Oh really? So he didn't want to deal with being second fiddle. The Rod Stewart Rod Stewart was too fucking strong

Speaker 1:          00:55:20       back as a Greg Guitar. But you can't fuck with Maggie May. I saw Rob Stewart last night and um, some, it was, some show that was at was like an infomercial where they were advertising some album, a series of. It was cds and dvds with all these. I guess it was all dvds. It was all musicians and comedians from some midnight special show and Rod Stewart was one of them. The rocking on the rock when you were out there looking like a lady. He looks like a ugly lady. He's in this little skinny guy in his weird outfit and he's prancing around stage in this weird way, but his songs are so. God damn good there is so soulful and he had some fucking songs, man. Maggie May.

Speaker 4:          00:56:10       Yeah, he's got an album called blind infatuation was already when he was starting to get weird. He's got an album called blondes have more fun. Oh my God. It's so hard. They called. You're insane. It is fucking bad. I listened to her once. I got to find it on Youtube. It's in that deep. But Rod Stewart, I went to see him. I never see fuck. Van Halen. I seen them bitches sucking Dick. Wrapped the show. Rob Stewart got on stage. There was two people made you want to suck my Dick and that's rod stewart and Kenny Rogers and do what? The white head. What we saw as soon as that motherfuckers started singing lady, but

Speaker 1:          00:56:47       that's such a unique voice, such unique voice like vocally and like the shit that he sang about, like the way he would sing, like they will kind of vulnerable songs, but in a weird way like, like Maggie may wake up, Maggie, I think I got something to say to you. It's late September and I really should be back in school. Like what is this song? Like, what is it about? It's like some guy was trying to find himself, you know, steal my daddy's q and make a living out of playing pool, you know, found myself or rock and roll band. The needs a helping hand. I mean like the songs were so weird and unusual man. Like his, his, just his stylistically the things that he was into singing about, you know, he was a, he was a bad motherfucker.

Speaker 4:          00:57:27       Really? Meek voice. Seeing your face bad. Fuck God. Damn. That's a good song. That's a song that's like, it's still, no matter where you are, when that song comes on, you're happy. You know, I will stay in my car until he,

Speaker 1:          00:57:42       I'm even if I'm in a rush until he say steal my dad his q and make a living that, a plan.

Speaker 4:          00:57:49       Every time you're in a car and stuff, I just got to sit. I got to sit tight. I don't care if I'm late, I'll tell you. I'll go to your house. Dude. I would've been here five minutes ago.

Speaker 1:          00:57:58       Fucking Maggie Mae was on and I'm, you know, I got out of respect. I got to listen to that song. There's a few songs is a few songs. Call me the breeze, call me the breeze comes on. She is

Speaker 4:          00:58:09       cleaner. Sisters, jump shot like vocal trouble. I like fucking all that crazy skiddish shit. They got another one on that album. I got an inside that is just so fucking cool.

Speaker 1:          00:58:19       You know? I knew in high school when I was 14 years old, when jump came out, van Halen jump came out. I knew there was something wrong with using keyboards. I knew back then like because everybody was in the van Halen, but I was in high school. Okay. When I was in high school in 1980, one was my freshman year of high school and my sister's boyfriend at the time was this kid. His name was jeff and he was John. Yeah, John Jewett, sorry. And he was really into van Halen to the point where he's going to be mad at me. Forgot his name. Um, hi dog. And uh, uh, he was really into van Halen to the point where he had it on his license plate. His license plate was van Halen. I was car and everybody was in the van Halen. And then the new van Halen came out. It was 1984. That was the album, right? Wasn't it? With jump. The new album came out, I remember in high school and everybody's like, oh, the new van handles out. It's awesome. And I was like, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude. I'm like, what the fuck is this? Love that shit.

Speaker 5:          00:59:22       I remember thinking this is lacking in Seoul. What's lacking in sold jump? That's on jump as well. Job. That song, that keyboard, that electronic keyboard manner that is not as good. You hear running with the devil, you know, hot for teacher, you know those are. Those are real songs. But geometry. What, what song is being streets on? Oh Shit. Oh God damn means treats is good. When that album came out, when the boom boxes were becoming popular member, everyone had to move their shoulders, stereo boom boxes. And that song was one of the first songs I remember hearing. And just awesome stereo. That seems so future. Like eighties was like all about break dancing and you know, like the future and stuff like women and children first. No, that was the second one. Really. So it's van Halen one. Fair warning, fair warning. I got wanted log.

Speaker 5:          01:00:23       Strike that pool boy down. They had some fucking jams. We had some good fucking unchained. Yeah. Main streets. Unchained. Woo. If this is love or hung out with David Lee Roth at the comedy store once videotaped. Yeah, he is cool. But we had it. We had to not release it because he talked to a lot of shit about some people. He didn't want it released. Um, but uh, he, he actually, they contacted you right the next day, the next day his, his fellow, the guy who works for him contacted Brian is like, please, please don't release that because David Lee Roth, just, he's just a, a free talker. He just hangs around and starts talking shit. He was talking shit about girls. He was talking shit about, you know, people in other bands and music that sucks. And guys who can't fucking, he's like you. And in a way, Lisa, he's got a little bit, he can't carry the spread.

Speaker 5:          01:01:13       He's got a little bit of that in him. But he was funny, man. He's a funny guy. He's a real guy. He had a real band and something happened and they replaced them with that fake fucking Sammy Hagar been open for Sabic when they had deal. People were spitting out of Philadelphia in Philadelphia. They were rolling, just spit off their fingers. They call it like whatever they do when they throw it at you. And I remember watching fucking singer and spit flying by and he's trying to duck and shit. It was like, I always did. Did you, did you like David Lee Roth when he did his own solar stuff? No. No. David Lee Roth needed Eddie van Halen and Eddie van Halen needed. Look, man, the. It's, it's not just one person man. It's fucking teams. It's the creative juices of everybody together. That's the really interesting shit. It's just hard to get that to work because you got egos and then he got Valerie Bertinelli who most likely probably wanted to fuck David Lee Roth but couldn't get them and got Eddie van Halen instead and then shit got weird and she was like, why do you keep them around? He's such an Egomaniac, you know, because she really wanted to fuck

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       David Lee Roth. At least that's what I would assume. But David Lee Roth was cool as fuck man. He was one of the first guys that like, I came up to me after the show and I was actually nervous. I was nervous to talk to the ugly raw and when he was telling me I was funny, you know, like dude, I fucking loved it. That was great. It was like, I had no idea. I thought you were just that fear factor guy. You're a fucking liar. I'm like, Holy Shit. I'm talking to David Lee Roth, like for me, going back to Newton south high school in 1983, you know, listening to the, you know, sitting out in the courtyard with everybody listening on the cassette player, listening to fucking Van Halen, and then all of a sudden I'm sitting here, just me and Eddie Bravo and Brian and we're hanging out in front of the Goddamn comedy store.

Speaker 1:          01:02:57       There's no one even surrounding them. There's no moms of people were just hanging out. He just showed up unannounced on like some random Tuesday or Wednesday or something like that. Hung out in the back of the, paid for his fucking ticket, hung out in the back of the club like a normal person and then came out to give me props and I'm sitting there talking to David Lee Roth and I'm shell shocked. I'm like, I'm talking. I'm like, I can't even believe I'm talking to David Lee Roth and we're talking about my comedy. I'm talking to David Lee Roth, but how much he liked my set. I'm like, wow, this is crazy. This is bizarre. And he was just a UCP, but the store, they're not looking for attention. Yeah. When you see somebody who's not looking for attention, like I seen Chris Cornell at the store would not go Wednesday night.

Speaker 1:          01:03:36       I kept looking around this motherfucker. I seen Dr Dre there a couple of times. A couple times. Yeah, I slipped up. We were there one night when he came in with that chick black Michelle a go. That's the one who was married to. Right. He was married to him, but he came and not dating her, but he came in with her like they were out in the night and they all went up to see Eddie Griffin. I can't remember what her name was. A cute little chick with black kid. Just got a reality show now with all black sisters really kind of looked the same. I got to think of her name. She's a comic. No, no, no. She's a big time. Big Time. Second time black. Okay. Well, I don't know who that would be, but the comedy store was famous for that because the comedy store, even though it's run by retards, it's, it's a god Damn Hollywood landmark.

Speaker 1:          01:04:23       I mean, that's spot. First of all, I would always be bad. Just completely baffled that here. I mean this is no recession going on and this is, you know, the Hay Day of the, you know, the nineties and the early two thousands and it's across the street from the House of Blues and yet on a Friday night, there's nobody there on a Friday night. There's fucking 50 people in the car. Like, this is criminal. You guys have the greatest spot on the planet earth. Not only does it have the greatest name and the history of comedy, not only is it a place where Richard Pryor film live at the fucking sunset strip, I mean, this is, uh, an amazing place in history and yet there's 50 people there on a Friday night. Like, that's so fucked up it was. But it's such a Hollywood icon that people are always going to gravitate to that spot just to peek in, you know, it's like, it's what it is, is basically las version of the comedy cellar, except it's not as good.

Speaker 1:          01:05:17       It's not run the same way. It's not as like the comedy cellar in New York is where all the top guys go and fuck around and workout. It's known and it's kind of like a restaurant attached to it. People eat there and shit. And you know, Jimmy Norton Rose wrote his fucking road is booked there. He brings a laptop and dudes are always hanging out there. So it's, it's a real, like a place where all the comics come. But in la, the comedy stores, the closest thing you know, it was like the closest icon place. I mean the Improv is the best club in town, but the comedy store has the best name. It's get the best feel to get the best location, you know, even to the Long Beach Laugh factory. That's was fucking awesome. It wasn't really great. Location is a really, really nice. What is the deal with that?

Speaker 1:          01:06:03       Can you go if you're not friends with Jo Koy? Nobody has. No. Uh, oh, that's right. He left a job, but he used to keep all the other Filipinos out. Right. Oh, the Asians. He didn't want anybody making any Asian jokes and he would work. He wanted only, only his Filipino jokes. Did you watch the, didn't it? Louis show with Louis Ck. I watched it on a line. I've watched that segment. It was more than one segment with Louis. There was Dane Cook. It starts off with Jim Martin. Yeah. Yeah. I watched it is interesting. It was like there's a little bit of revisionist history there. You know, I think it was unscripted. It almost seemed like real, like it almost seemed like they actually just sat down or like, I think they worked it out. I worked out the beats and then they, they did it, but I didn't like the arch I did.

Speaker 1:          01:06:51       I thought Danes argument was kind of silly. Like why didn't you stick up for me? Like why didn't you didn't say that I didn't steal from you, like, you know, like I've never stolen. Why would I steal a joke? I never told a joke ever. Like the argument was like really strange, you know? Yeah. I guess if you really think Dane Cook was guilty, then yeah, there was one of the jokes. I don't know if Dane Cook was guilty, but I do know he saw Louis Ck do those jokes before he did them and that's enough. That's all it is. All three of them are on the same seat and Louis did those in front of him and he did it in front of everybody he did in front of all of us. It's not. Look Louis Ck is the most prolific guy working today. He puts out a new hour every year, but back then he didn't.

Speaker 1:          01:07:32       Back then Louis was doing the same act for a long fucking time. So those bits. The bit about the guy getting hit by a car. He did that bit for years. She did it before the dude about a guy getting hit by a car. Steve Martin? No, no, no. Steve Martin did the naming the child naming the child a crazy name. I thought he got the wrong bit. Really? Yeah, I thought I hit by a car too, about what you're trying to say something to them really well or something like that. Really. I think you're wrong, but I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure you're wrong. I'm pretty sure the Steve Martin joke that, that, and this is true that Steve Martin came up with a um, a bit that's really similar to both Danes bit and Louis Ck is bid that if I have a kid I'm going to name them some crazy name.

Speaker 1:          01:08:18       It's unpronounceable, you know, this is being silly. Like that's not, that's not stealing. I mean, I mean obviously those guys, you know, it's kind of stealing. Look if those guys had heard Steve Martin and forgot about it and then reintroduce the joke, you know, like I didn't realize that they had a like, like just forgotten it, but you've got to stop doing it once you hear it about Steve Martin's bit. But the difference is Louis was doing it in front of Dane. So whether or not Dane is a joke thief that, you know, look, I liked Dane. I think he's a talented guy. I think he's a great marketer and I think he's a good person. I really do. But I also think he's wildly ambitious, you know, and I think that sometimes when you're wildly ambitious you don't even realize what you're doing and you're doing it.

Speaker 1:          01:09:08       You don't mean to do it, but you start doing it and those bits work and then you don't want to let them go. And even though someone's like, hey man, that sounds like Joe Diaz was bit. You don't want to let them go because they are weapons and you use them and use them to get what you want, which is you want love, you want that love and adulation. You want to be killing up there and you get addicted to it and you can't let it go. And if he's addicted to, if he's guilty of anything, he's guilty of that. So that's why I thought it was the argument was weird. I was like, man, you guys are like, you know, it's weird. But I liked how Louis such a good dude, man, you know, like even his whole way he's approaching it like I didn't like what people were saying about you and I didn't like that people were getting mad at you.

Speaker 1:          01:09:46       And I was like, wow. Like he's, he's just, uh, you know, one of the reasons why he's doing so well is that he's his, his, like the way he thinks is a good way to think he's a good guy. Yeah. He sticks to his fucking. He's not like these other folks that we have around 24 fucking hours a day that I've seen Louis. He came up to me with the comedy store. I used to host on Sunday nights and he would come up and do a set every night. Very polite. One night he came up to me, he goes, are you available next week, Bro? And I go, yeah. And he goes, I'm going to put them on, put you on my show. He took my name and number or like, whatnot, not good at grammar coke and never thought anything of it. Later he called me.

Speaker 1:          01:10:24       He paid me more than anybody else has ever paid me, and he took care of me. They had me there for the weekend. He came with his word. So because of that I give him my loyalty forever because he's one of the few of the. All of these fucking weak motherfuckers we got around this. That sticks to his fucking word. He's a real. His real not give them props. I don't give them none of these fucking Beasley motherfucking prompts, but Louis deserves my heart because he put me on television without every expecting anything from me. And he just told me he was like put me on. Two days later they called and I respect that to the. Especially like I said, with these fucking much we have around us as a comedian. He's the most inspirational guy to me and I think to everybody because he's the most prolific, like you can argue over who makes you laugh the most because I always say, you make me laugh the most. You're you're favorite guy to watch. You know, and I think there's, there's some moments. The moment when we were hanging out at the Improv and you're on stage, we were doing the weekend there and you did that fucking bit about about dead Dick, about you don't accept dead Dick and you've made it up on the fly. He goes, you take two popsicle sticks and you tie that pick up and

Speaker 6:          01:11:31       back in like a wounded soldier and when you sit, when you say,

Speaker 1:          01:11:36       when you said it, you, you, I knew you ad libbed it because I know you're, I know you're act by heart and you knew you had lived it and it fucking destroy you or beat red in the face laughing at your own shit, but you want me to do and me and ran should fear in the back of the room and we just go. He's the best. He's the best. Nobody makes me laugh harder than you, but Louis Ck is more prolific. He's the most prolific,

Speaker 6:          01:11:59       cool conversations about standing up with Louis or my act and my life has changed. I'm telling you this right off the bat, I believe it. I had to. I think he's changing the way a lot of comics do it and he's making guys write more. What was the conversation that you had with them? I had a conversation about storytelling and about jokes and he said that he had watched me and that, uh, the material was a little fucking crazy, but he loved that. He respected it, but he goes, you have so much more to tell people. He goes, I want you to talk about what is dark to you. That's why I started talking about mugging the hooker. That's why I started talking about all the crimes I had done outline and that's why I'm writing them on stage. Now you know what you need to talk about onstage, what brother you need to talk about finding your dead mother when you were high on acid.

Speaker 6:          01:12:43       How fucking craziest you gotta. Tell them about that onstage, bro. That is. But that's a show stopper. I know Joe. I got nowhere to go after you find your dead mother on the floor. Jesus can't follow you. Jesus can't. Fuck. I tried it already. You could end with it or you could end with it. And what about the rest of the fucking show? I got to let him eat in 20 minutes. So bad, you know, it's like going up to somebody going, hey bro, how you doing it here? We go up to somebody like by mistake and go, hey bro, how you doing? How's your brother? He just died. Yeah. Boom. Do you feel at a comedy? Show it a one man show setting. I could do it, but at the comedy show I cannot do it. It's too hard to recover from it. What does that mean?

Speaker 2:          01:13:24       He just tried to change this act over the weekend and Ontario and Katt Williams. Tell me what happened. Uh, he, uh, tried to do something different supposedly like he tried to do more of a serious, uh, kind of like one man shows where California Improv Improv. Yeah. And then the audience, which I knew he was there, I wouldn't want to see him. They wasn't having it. And so they started like, I guess booing or doing something like that. And then a cat starts screaming at him or doing something. And then the Ontario Improv. So this is, by the way, all based off tmz a interior. I've kicked them off stage and kicked them out of the building and then he wouldn't leave and so then they called the police and the police had to take them off the premises and they canceled the whole weekend.

Speaker 1:          01:14:05       Well he's definitely crazy because he keeps getting arrested and there's a lot of shit going on with him. He got caught with guns a couple times and. But he did a show recently in New Mexico and a bunch of people wanted their money back because he got on stage, it shows a 9:00 show. He didn't get on stage to like midnight and he goes on stage, the music stays on while he's on stage and we use it stays on and he's, he takes his shirt off and he starts dancing and he's dancing around with a shirt off. Then he starts doing pushups and then he starts talking to pushups, doing pushups on stage with no shirt on. And then he starts talking to people in the audience. So either he's just like trying to come up with some new material and just going deep into the crazy ben or he's really legitimately losing his mind. You know, we said it before, man. We've said it so many times. Brilliant people. There's a lot of brilliant people that are very close to insanity and I know you've been close to and Saturday because I've watched you be close to Saturdays here. Joey. Joey's been close to. Yeah, that was normal for Joey. That's pretty fucking normal. I just have to wait for that storm to end, but. No, no, no, I see. I know. You know what I mean?

Speaker 6:          01:15:13       I feel it at times. I feel it when I get home writing out your podcast, I've got to force myself out of the fucking house because of that. That's why you go to into your head. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:15:29       Yeah. You don't want to be alone with your head. Sometimes. There's moments where you need to interact with other people just to get a sense of normalcy. Right?

Speaker 6:          01:15:36       When you add them to the point where sometimes you're writing and you get into it and you're, you're there and all of a sudden you fucking mind just go somewhere, bro. It just goes somewhere where it just hasn't been in with standups. I could see it. I feel myself slipping. I tell you, I felt myself slipping a lot with the cope when I was on stage when I was talking to myself and I caught myself with four to eight and that would catch myself at eight. Wait a second. I was just at four a fuck that I get to eight when I was talking about earlier about Roger Waters.

Speaker 1:          01:16:04       Roger waters the article in rolling stone. One of the things he was talking about his childhood, his dad was in the military. My Dad died when he was really young and uh, you know, he grew up without. There's photos of him and his dad and all of sudden his dad's gone. That whole, that void. You know, there's something about loss and childhood. You know, when you, when you're young and fucked up, things happens. That creates like seemingly the most brilliant people the most, but they're also the most likely to do something fucking crazy, you know, crazy like looking fucking look at what's going on with Dave Chappelle here with Dave Chappelle, did the other dap and now he goes on stage and for 45 fucking minutes it tells one joke and then he says, this is a test of wills, you know, I'm not gonna say nothing.

Speaker 1:          01:16:48       You know what I'm saying? That Nita and like stays up there for 45 fucking minutes and know and you know, and people like, I just want, I just want to be entertained. We tell some jokes. He's like, you know, go see, go by my dvds, you know, you'll see you'll be entertained. Like meanwhile he was just standing on stage like saying nothing for 45 minutes. And again, this is a lot of hearsay to, I don't know the exact story of what happened, but this is what I keep hearing. And there was a, another video of him going on stage at some festival and he bombed there too and he was doing the same thing. Just standing on stage with no, no, no, no. This is not this. He's not doing anything gross. Just standing on stage.

Speaker 6:          01:17:27       I don't know what happens to Comedians, the comedians life and I could sit here in the next 20 minutes and give you a list of them that they think that they go from becoming comedians to thinking that I listen to what the fuck they're saying.

Speaker 1:          01:17:42       Well, that's it. I was listening to his reading his texts. He was getting tax was on stage on reading though. He has this whole new thing, style of comedy that he's doing. I've seen it. I've seen it twice. My friend Demar seen it four times or three times and what it is, it looks very organic. Like he starts off and he automatically starts going and we talked about this, but that's not what he's doing. He was doing that. That was not what they need to show. What they're saying is he's not doing anything but you're standing on stage. Not Saying a word. No. He said he was talking. He wasn't just sitting there ninth St. Jude. It this latest show that I am talking to you about. I'm not talking to show that you saw. I'm saying the show that he did recently. He got on stage and he was talking about how it was a battle of wills. I'm not gonna say nothing and we'll see how long we. Last year he was gonna. He was being quiet and he wanted them to be quiet until. Let's see who breaks first he said nothing and people were losing their mind like he. He told one joke and then the rest of the set he sat around and did nothing.

Speaker 6:          01:18:45       He. There's a point with these fucking comedians that they think that they go from being a comic. The social commentary, like they did something to that I deserved this social commentary and that's what's really going on. We've seen it with Eddie Griffin. We see it with this fucking guy. Now we see it with a bunch of comedians. I see that I put on that button, green room or whatever was just to watch stand hope and I had to put up with your buddy from Svu and Janine Garafalo. The guy says to the fucking guy, Richard Belzer, you know a guy that never said nothing funny this whole fucking life, and he's asked Dan hope. Why the fuck is he there? But they're sitting in there, not even stand open. Why are you here? And Stan hope goes because I came to see the suck my dick fest. Between you and Janine Garafalo.

Speaker 6:          01:19:27       Yeah. And then he goes, well, a literally like trying to be cute. You know, like these fucking idiots in Hollywood do like literally. How about I get up and put my dick in your mouth and prevents Matt just to show you how we're going to do this here. Somewhere along the line these comics think that we need their social commentary and we fucking don't. We fucking don't. We don't give a fuck what you think. Just tell us fucking jokes guy. Just tell us jokes. We don't give a fuck. Nobody gives a fuck. That's when a show goes sour because nobody gives a fuck. We paid to see you do an hour of material. If at the last two minutes you want to summarize your set and do it, do it, but if you're going to summarize it with bullshit that don't live by anyway, shut your mouth and just do the fucking jokes, Bro.

Speaker 6:          01:20:11       That's my big problem lately. Nobody wants to shut that fucking mouth either. Do the jokes to shut the fucking map. What is all this chitter chatter about? Stupidity for that day in that green room. I'm trying to watch stand hope. One of the most brilliant comments, a dear friend of mine, I couldn't watch it. Janeane Garofalo saying that the guy and in Tucson that killed the fucking, that tried to kill the congressman was pushed to kill him because social media force them. First of all, when she said that, that's not what a comedian worries is. She really says that. What a career. A real comedian doesn't worry about that. That's somebody who wants you to think that they care. So like me, because I do care. You don't care that it's fake tattoos. You got to fake. You know? That's what they care about. That's what we're talking about.

Speaker 6:          01:20:55       Whether it's a fad or whatever the fuck it, I can't deal with it no more want me to make me feel, make me funny, make me laugh. I would refuse to go on stage and give you my opinion of the White House, so the tea party, because at the end of the week, nomadic guy, I paid to watch you do jokes. I want you to take me through your world, but that's it. I don't want to hear no social commentary and we've seen it from a lot of comedians, bro. After a 55 minute mark, I think I got to listen to this shit. Do your 55 minutes.

Speaker 1:          01:21:21       Well, they also, they've developed a following of people who hang on every word and you know, there's a lot of them that think they have something brilliant to say and so they choose the venue of standup comedy and look, this fucking podcast is a perfect example of the. A lot of times people have something to say. It's not necessarily funny, but it's interesting, but this is the right venue for it. A podcast is the right venue for us. This is not what I would ever do on stage when I do, when I do my set, I have a fucking set I'll fuck around a little bit, but I'm trying to be funny period period and that's because people used to always think that like comedy should be used in some way to like educate, educate people in the light and people and then it's important to do that. And almost to the point of sacrificing comedy. Like, you know, Bill Hicks had some material that was like that where it was not funny at all.

Speaker 6:          01:22:05       At the end. Bill his wasn't funny. Let's get out of the way at the end, the Lance Williams garbage. Listen to the live from the village gate. That's almost. You could even hear the people like ready to laugh and was like, Oh God.

Speaker 1:          01:22:17       Well some of his stuff like he. Yeah, that was actually before the life in the village gate one was earlier and what that was like. He did the bid on abortion and this is what I'm talking about him. He was like, you know, like you don't want people to abortion. Then you fucking raise them, you fucking raise them. That's what he was yelling at. You fucking raised the kids and there is no joke and I'm like, wow, this is a mess. This is a mess. This is a comedy club. Okay. You just yelling out. You fucking raise them and being irate. Yes, you're right. I see your point. If you don't want people to have abortions, then you should raise their children. I see what you're saying that you should get involved. I see what you're saying, but you're not being funny period. That's not a joke.

Speaker 1:          01:22:53       You know, and that's a thing that happens to a lot of comics. It's they, they start to get people who want to listen to them. They start to get people who think they're deep and they start listening to those people and they do this at a comedy club and they up at a comedy club. We've seen it happen. We've seen it happen in so many titles. I thought there was this fucking kid from Jimmy's comedy. Allah. God Damn, I forget his name, but he's really. He was really funny. He was kind of crazy. He was really funny and this was like in the the late eighties, early nineties, and he came to Hollywood. He drove to La and it was working at the comedy store for awhile. Do you remember the kid? Kind of good looking guy, but overweight. Fucking forget his name. It drives me nuts, but he was a perfect example of that.

Speaker 1:          01:23:35       He would go on stage at the comedy store. They fucking tortured him. They tortured him. Can you go onstage and try to be like deep and meaningful when he was funny, he can be really funny. Like you had some good bits. I'm fucking good. Bit about hair club for men. It was really funny. You know, they show the guy playing tennis and they show the guy swimming. He goes, what? They should show a guy. It's pulling out and shooting his fucking load on some chicks back, you know, and she goes, nice hair. He had a fucking real good bit about some good bits. We went to the store one day. I mean, you know, like when you go to an open mic and just sit down. Yeah, we do that all the time. Kid, that window that was older and he goes, let me give you a personal issue with my Italian family portrait.

Speaker 4:          01:24:23       That would be bad. We just die like this joke ever goes. This was in my impersonation of my. This is a portrait of my Italian family. He was leaning for folks at home. He had put his hands up like someone's trying to take his picture, but sometimes like I was telling somebody that they're the best joke. I heard that you off my fucking ever was Charlie Hill at the store when you're stoned talking to somebody and he's back. Then he goes, how are you doing? My name is Charlie Hill. My real name was mountain, but they shortened the dog. I fucking lost my cookies at that dumb. Just because you're high. No, but that Joe Rogan Milwaukee this weekend I can the white patches theater, blue ribbon be Athena because we're going to have a good time. The last time you went to Milwaukee was with Chris Mcguire at that fair?

Speaker 4:          01:25:17       Yeah. It wasn't really. That was something we did summerfest I went like a year before you and a year after you. Some fucking, some guy that was there.

Jail for making fucking passed in some stupid state. So she was retaliation from whatever. And she was a drug dealer. That's why I robbed because she was a drug that in Robert's decided because I wanted to Robert, but she used to always tell me that there was great food in Milwaukee. And I'm like, are you fucking middle? What are you going to do? What do you eat? Cheese with it. Well, this is another part of it that a lot of people don't know with Donnie Brasco busted all those people. Half of the people he busted weren't in New York. They were in Milwaukee. He busted this crew up there. That was the ballasts theories. They ran a vending machines all over the country, big time.

They have to after nine slash 11, if a drug, if anybody whose phone is tapped, they call you right after the person goes to trial, the government supposed to send you an affidavit claiming the date you were on the phone with them and all that shit. So I was telling this kid this. I was saying on the podcast before, and I think he doubted me. He goes, can you please bring the paper? Yeah. You know what? There's a lot of people on my message board. You guys are some disrespectful fucking shit heads. Some of you guys who don't believe things, you're so fucking rude about it. And one of the things is joey. So don't, don't hold this up bro. We gotta treat this like everybody can hear this. You can read it if you like.

Speaker 5:          01:31:29       But um, so many people say, oh, this good comes onto the podcast. We just launched and tell stupid stories. Joey Diaz was not allying crazy, crazy life. I don't give a fuck. I've known. I've known Joe. If you only think about me, I don't give a fuck about. None of your motherfucking got no reason to lie. I don't owe you nothing. They don't know. Send the thief lighter. No one. Why ruin it with ally and if ain't nothing, it ain't gotta lie. They don't know how you're living. I got to know when I met you roles and hang on your all day

Speaker 6:          01:32:00       saying shit. The people get a fucking life. You fucking maggots get a fucking life. It's over. He don't want to say to you, but I'll just read. Most of them are taken advantage of the fact that there are non day and they judge people and it's not just mainly do everybody. I've seen somebody do to fucking like a music thing with kids the other day. It's like, you know what man? Who the fuck are you? What have you done? And then when you go to the youtube page, they have done nothing. They're nothing. They just to put videos up a burden. Shit. Well I don't think you have to do something to have an opinion aside, but you know what, if you don't have to be a can't, you'd have to be a cut. Be Straight instead of given it to me with an anonymous fuckin and give it to me intelligently.

Speaker 6:          01:32:40       I had a chick last much Joe Rogan who sent me the best emm or an email I ever got. She said she went to a show and she was very unhappy with my family. She didn't like that it was dirty and you know what? Ten years ago I would've said suck my dick. And I emailed her back like a man. You know what she said to me? She weren't. You were funny, but they didn't need the necessity, that curse. And I said, you should have said that you hurt my feelings. She goes, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. She goes, I just thought there was more to you than curse. I'm picturing Joey Diaz along with his nine fucking carrots answering this pitches. Email 11. No, I got gotta. I got it. You know you gotta answer these emails from people, but it's really funny, like when somebody, like somebody said you didn't put the drain on your Dick, who would make that up?

Speaker 6:          01:33:23       Why would you make that up? I'm telling you that I'm. It's like you don't have an agent like a big time agent that moved away and now he's in Dallas, so his name was first on. I am Deb. Do you know how many fucking people send him emails once a week telling me to take the. Had a Mug, a fag video off. So wait a second. I'm telling you a story that a fag beat the fuck out. I go confused agents, but this agent is the tap, but he moved. Now he's in Dallas. He's a big time, big time agent. He handles athletes now and he was telling you to take that video now. Me One morning he was dog. You have a video on there, but bargain fags. He's in fucking Austin, Texas. He, he's a sports agent and he got his dog. I keep getting emails from people.

Speaker 6:          01:34:05       It was late last year saying that you better take the video. Did you mug a fag? And I got. Why would I lie about getting beat up by a fucking guy? Why would somebody lie about something like that? Like why? What would make something like that? I can say if I beat up 10 fags or I stabbed him and throw him over the cliff or fucking Joe, he's lying, but who would lie about getting beat up by the fucking guy? Who Will? Why would somebody make? People wouldn't make stories up, but the point is you don't know. Why would I would? Because you're crazy if you're a crazy person. Ever understood what it was. I can't even lie on stage. Oh, I know a lot of people who lie. Oh, they all make up stories on stage. They might not. I don't want to hear about that, but I can't even. Like I see. I see a friend of my neck quit drinking and she's still doing drinking jokes on stage. Why are you doing that? Really? You're doing that. You can't commit that. Why doesn't she does talk about how she quit drinking, but she used to do this. What? Fuck up my that say something

Speaker 5:          01:34:58       to them. I just move on with my life. I'm just making a fuck quote here. It's like we need to go on up on st and doing cocaine jokes. I'll do it. I don't live it no more. I don't even know what that's like. Why would I talk about it? I talk about it. Yeah, in the years before, but I can't stand with those. Another thing you did that night of the wounded soldier, you were making fun of me because I had a five hour energy drink and go, what are you doing with that fucking five hour energy? And you went on stage with that. He goes, five hour energy drink. He goes, you know what? I do a and I wake up in the morning and I have all fucking big line. I snot a big line of cocaine as y'all fucking five hours, eight ball.

Speaker 5:          01:35:30       That's it. But for five hours it was red bands birthday and this week Mr Rogan has a birthday this week. He told, I forgot you're 37 now you're going to have to grow up eventually. You know what is your birthday? Don't you start getting the 11th, August 11th. That's, that's what is this day. Two days. Two days for. Oh Shit. I thought you will invite me up for the fucking bright. Come on Thursday. Thursday. Bitch you want to do, but we'll do it. We'll do it. Who's coming? Why don't you have all of us? Because I got to work all this week. I'm back to the grind. Back to fear factor family after I got them doing everyday this week because Friday we're bolting to Milwaukee for this pabst theater. That's August 13th. Milwaukee, PAPP's theater. Me and Joe Diaz. Tickets are almost sold out. Get in it. Pitches, don't sleep. I'm looking forward to that.

Speaker 5:          01:36:19       We're going to have a good time. I can't wait. I've been looking for is the last time we did a Gig was a vegas. No, we just did Irvine. Oh No, no. Pasadena. We did the Irvine in Pasadena, but I still got an email. The last theater we did. I'm thinking that's the theater we did on the road. Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh was fucking awesome data. That library. It used to be a library. Fucking great. Carnegie Library Music called fucking place was awesome. Pittsburgh is great. It's one of the things we were saying. It's one of the most underrated fucking cities. We didn't like it when we did that Improv. I didn't go with you that time. I had been there before. I used to go to the funny bone. It was okay. Like the Chinese food as well when we were there. The one of the reasons why we didn't like it is because there was apparently there was some fucking sports thing going on, some did.

Speaker 5:          01:37:03       They're a really loyal to their teams and when you got like a big game going on, nobody wants to go to see nothing. And even people that bought tickets didn't come to the show because it was some big sports game. Some football game or I don't know what the fuck it was. Team is in first place in baseball and you know what, didn't they win the world series or something this year? No, no, no. But they're there right now. They're super long. Uh, what did the steelers. Yeah, I think so. Sorry. I can't remember. How funny is that? We don't know. Shit. I can't fucking remember. But you're trying to be funny Brian. There a cricket doesn't. They don't play cricket in the manual that you fucked her room. There's nothing in there, bro. Empty. I drank, yeah, 8:50 of those fucking coffee shops. They make you thirsty, dude. That was fucking birthday boys in the room is shit I got peed on today by who? I grew up. We were having sex and she accidentally p for first time everyone was

Speaker 3:          01:37:56       coming and it was like it felt going down my leg. I'm like, wait, that's not normal. And she's like, oh my God, I think it is p. If you ever had that happen to you might be dating the retarded girl. No, she said that. She just didn't even know. Why do you always go? I've noticed every time I say something you automatically get angry. I'm angry. Retard. You say a lot of silly shit and I'm making fun of it. It's not called defensive. That's not defense. So I pissed on myself. Good. They'd be mad that I'm. Every time I say something like, uh, anytime I say anything, you always get angry, get angry, but you say some ridiculous shit. Dude. What's those pills? You got a mocking you or clowning at you. It's like you can't just say ridiculous shit and have me not say anything.

Speaker 3:          01:38:39       Yeah, but a lot of times I say something that you think is ridiculous, like hash is actually a resin resident residents. One of the ways they make it as resident that's not hash rehashes. There was a process to make cash that doesn't involve burning it. Resident is when you scrape a pipe, that's what resonance Hash Resin is a different process. It's not the resident of smoking been multiple ways to make it, but one of the ways, one of that ways to make hash is rising. One of the ways to make cassius scraping residence. I don't know if that's anything. Neither one of us know enough about how to make have to assess and shouldn't they? They take the thc as some somebody you're pretending that you don't like say silly shit on purpose, like you're playing a role and I mock you for it. Now. Also Syria as an example of me staying on just saying, you're just upset because you love this girl, and I said she might be.

Speaker 3:          01:39:30       I mean I'm just saying in general, every time I say something you get really angry at me. Really angry. You just noticed it. I noticed it, I noticed that all the time. Okay. I noticed you say ridiculous shit all the time and I, I clown you for it. But it doesn't mean that I'm really angry at, you know, I know, I know. But why does it every time I say something, you always have to completely shut down. That was barely bashing your girl. Pissed all over you. And I said she had an orgasm and she's never done this before, but she had the same time and she was like, whoa, this is crazy. You don't think that it's appropriate to say you might be dating retarded girl. That's a joke. That's a joke, dude. Obvious. I know. I liked her girlfriend. She's a nice person.

Speaker 3:          01:40:09       What? You're following the same thing that's wrong with that. Just, you know, she's your girlfriend about this shit unless you tend to follow what I'm saying. Nothing wrong with that. But Brian, you can't get the, the reason why I do this because in the past we've talked about where girls are really juicy and we spray that, that it. Is it p or not? And uh, I, I actually said no it's not, I just know girls that have done that before, but when she did it, it felt like she was coming like crazy, like, like I've had experienced before. But when I smelled it it was 100 percent. So with other girls at squirted it smelled different. So this time you smelled it, smelled it because it was just like, Whoa, why is it all over my asparagus now? Is there anything else that definitely makes you

Speaker 1:          01:40:53       pee? Smell pineapples, pineapples. It makes it smell good or taste good. Your loads. Pineapples. I supposed to make your loads tastes good, but that's what I hear. But pee smell a pea. It's always asparagus, right? That's the number one thing. If you thought of, like if I said, what makes you a piece? Think you'd say parents, asparagus. There's nothing else. Right?

Speaker 2:          01:41:13       And see vitamin C, vitamin C, that's when it makes it bright orange and bright orange.

Speaker 1:          01:41:19       Well, all vitamins make your pee bright. I mean maybe it is the vitamin C, Vitamin C, is it the more you're dehydrated yellow your pis gets yes. Or if you have a lot of vitamins, if you take a lot of vitamins, that's why people say, Oh, well you took vitamins, which comes out in your pee. No, some of it does come on your p and it makes you appear different color, but a lot of it affects your body in a positive way. That's one of the weakest arguments ever. Like you shouldn't take vitamins. Just pm out. I've heard people say that so many times, Jesus Christ. Are you really going into every cell and monitoring how your nutrients are distributed and you know for sure it all goes out in your urine. You Lazy. Fuck, you're so lazy. You won't even take vitamins. I've talked to so many people like that and they say, well, I'd like to take vitamins or just can't be bothered. Like you can't be bothered to stick a pill in your mouth and drink. How hard is it? You're eating, you're eating all this food. How hard is it to remember to put something in your mouth and drink and then you're healthier. You get nutrients that you're not getting from your diet.

Speaker 2:          01:42:12       Things that I do like that all the time. Then I'm like, that's so dumb. That entity like floss, I should like. I hate flossing the debt, but it's so easy. It takes what, two minutes and floss your teeth, but I can't do it. Like my body won't let me floss. I, I tried out for a couple of days and then I, I just hate it.

Speaker 1:          01:42:27       I think we're programmed in a certain way by the way we were raised and there's a lot of shit that people got on you when you were a little kid that you still to this day don't want to fucking do because your parents told you to do it. I have this problem with work, man. I don't like doing things that are work, you know, I don't mind doing things that are for me. Like I could work forever on. Okay. I can train, I can write, I can, you know, work on things. I can draw. I can work forever on things that I want to do, but if someone tells me I'm supposed to do something, I have a hard time. I have a hard time showing up for things on time. I don't want to. It's like part of me that wants to resist being on time and part of me that wants to resist doing work and I know it's from growing up.

Speaker 1:          01:43:09       It's from growing up, being forced to work, growing up, being forced to, you know, like to say that the thought of your work is dreariness and going to work is you're going to be miserable and you're gonna have to contain your emotions and contain your disdain for what you're doing and just force yourself to follow through. And I think that's a lot of us. It's like shit, like brushing your teeth. Brushing teeth is great, you know, but when you're a little kid, man, everybody told you to brush your teeth so it's annoying. So you're like, fuck you. I'm an adult. I'm going to eat. I'm going to go to sleep with fucking shit stuck in my teeth. Fuck. You know, you do it on purpose. These spite yourself by, by rebelling from your childhood and Joey. I mean, you grew up in the craziest way possible.

Speaker 1:          01:43:50       You grew up, you were sort of taken in by your, by your neighbors, right? Yeah, but when I was 15, I come from a house, get up, can I come from a house where my mother taught me wants to get in the shower, brush my teeth though, and if not, you got to fucking smack to them. But once you, once you've got outta there though. Once my mother died at 15, I moved to the other people, the neighbors when I met you. Right? This is, let me tell you something about when I met you, you know, when I met you, like, um, you know, I've known a lot of like wild motherfuckers my whole life and one of the things I said, I've said this about you on stage. And it's true. Like one of the things I love about hanging out with you is that there's a lot of people think there's rules to the way you're supposed to behave and live and think.

Speaker 1:          01:44:32       And then you meet somebody and go, Hey, this guy's not following any rules. I could say, Oh, I'm going to go follow him for a minute. Where you going, hey, where'd you, where'd you come up with this idea? Why are you doing this? He just, he just pulled you dig out. Are you sure you're going to go to jail? You see you smoking pot out in public. Like there's some people that, you know, when I grew up, I grew up very disciplined because I was a martial arts competitor and my from age 15 to 21 my life, my life was very, very disciplined. I didn't drink, I, I ate healthy foods. I trained all the time and the reason why I didn't drink a very rarely I might have smoked pot five times in my whole life from the time I was like, you know, 10 till the time I was like 21, maybe six at the most.

Speaker 1:          01:45:11       I might've got drunk three or four times because I was always worried about going to the gym the next day and getting fucked up. I was always worried like if I got drunk and then four weeks from now I have a fight. Would if I get my ass kicked in a fight that I would have won, if I didn't get drunk on that one day, I would so I would think like that. So I was super disciplined and then I met my friend Johnny B and my met my friend Johnny when I had gone from being a comedian or from from being a fighter to being a comedian. There was this drastic shift and drastic shift in the human beings and that was around. So I was around all these wild motherfuckers, but they were fighters. They were wild motherfuckers who were fighting in tournaments and kickboxing and you know, I knew dudes that would like fight in different tournament's just for a goof.

Speaker 1:          01:45:55       I knew dudes that would just go to a judo tournament. Didn't even practice judo. They would fight and karate tournaments. They weren't karate fighters that were, you know, they were talking about no guys, they don't just go and just try it out. They would do wild dudes who would just would take chances and start boxing. Yeah. I've been boxing. I'm hanging out with this gym in South Boston. I started boxing like, you know, this guy started wrestling. I mean I knew a lot of dudes who did a lot of wild shit, but it was always wild. You like martial arts type shit. It was crazy and dangerous, but it was, it was a discipline, sort of a crazy dangerous. And then when I started hanging around with Comedians, then all of a sudden I was hanging out with these wild Fox who are different. There's a different kind of wild fuck.

Speaker 1:          01:46:32       There was like an insecure and needy, but they would get drunk and fucked up and dudes would do dangerous shit and you know, it was a weird kind of a human being was a different kind of human being that I was ever around a lot of partiers, lot of people doing cocaine, people getting nothing. And then I met my friend Johnny and that was the, the total other end of the craziness. I mean, standup comedy was a craziness, but they ain't no crazier than a person who's a professional pool hustler. And that was my friend Johnny. My friend Johnny, when I met him, had nowhere to live, had nowhere to stay, did not know where he was, he didn't have a diamond is pocket and maybe had, if he had $5 he was playing someone for that $5 and that was all the money he had in the world and he, you know, he played with a house queue or sometimes he had his own queue, but I mean this dude was living wild, like completely wild and when I met you and um, you know, he was my friend, my best friend for years and you know, he died and um, I think it was like shit.

Speaker 1:          01:47:29       I v eight somewhere around there. And I remember when I met you at the comedy store, I remember meeting you and it was probably around that same year, somewhere around that same time. Yeah. I remember looking at this motherfucker. Here's another one. Like here's another dude just out there, wild in the streets. You had a pager sometimes you had a pager, you to pay the whole time. The same fucking page. I got it from J and J dot B dot. What year was this? You got this page? Ninety seven and I held onto that page until 2004 and that's what fuck these motherfuckers and this stupid rule never knew where joey was my rules bitch. You never knew what joey was and my friend Johnny had a page or two. That's how you got ahold of him. But that was back when nobody had a cell phone, but through the all the years of cell phones until we'd never had a cell phone.

Speaker 1:          01:48:18       Joey didn't get a cell phone until like 2004 first. Jackson, Spiderman two you've got to fake. Talked me into going to get Sam Raimi as by the man who was like, Yo, Yo, yo. So far. Yeah. Joey didn't have a cell phone. He was living on different people's couches, sleeping in a car until we got code. Yeah. Fucking going on the road with no clothes. Just fucking living off a fucking advances. And just. And by the way, by the way, he's doing comedy back then and he wasn't good. You weren't good you, you were a different comedian man. You know, and I always say that there's never a person that I've ever seen make the switch, flipped the switch and go from a guy who wasn't doing well on stage to a guy who was just destroyed, lost my inhibitions. I lost, but it was amazing.

Speaker 1:          01:49:03       It was because one of the things that was holding me down was going on my daughter. It was really holding me down and who I was. I felt. I kept thinking I was doing the role of choice, so until I committed to doing comedy and being a broke fucking comic the way you supposed to commit yourself to anything you dive into, I couldn't be good because I kept thinking of a time I was to back to Colorado will be a dad. That's what I kept thinking. I'm like, I can't be doing this shit. I'm like, Dad, but this is what was pulling me. I had nothing there with my daughter. I wanted to raise my daughter my way. I knew how I was going to raise a daughter. I was going to raise a daughter that she didn't grow up like these fucking dumb woman. You see that have dignity and they have fucking respect the same way. My mother, that's why I don't do what other people do a beat of the drum because that's how my mother raised me dog

Speaker 6:          01:49:48       to beat my own fucking drum if you don't like something, say it and how that wasn't a raise my daughter and. But the whole time I thought I was going to come to la and anytime I want to go back and get an apartment of boulders. I wasn't committed. One day I fucking got a thing that you wanted to change her name and the mother correlate with some bullshit story and this and I had to be this nice person. I don't like being nice if I don't have to bro. That's why I've changed so much. Especially after the blow. I don't take nothing from nobody now. Nothing. You can't get away with nothing. Nothing. So will you're saying is because I left my inhibitions. Go to be a good community you to. I wasn't committed to it. That's what it really was. Fuck the inhibitions.

Speaker 6:          01:50:26       I wasn't committed. I thought I wanted to be a dad. I wanted to be a dad. I wanted to be a dad, but they weren't opening up the door for me. I couldn't run that shit if I didn't like. What do you mean by the way? This is where it all goes to right now. We're going to straighten this out. This thing that happened in Denver, she threw me out because a lot of people have been tweeting me. What happened for sexual harassment? What are you talking about? The thing with the club, the comedy works comedy. There's a lot of people because most people have no idea what you're talking about because last week got a couple people asked me what Joey did. Here's, I'll fill you in. Joy Diaz has never been able to work with me at the comedy works in Denver and people always ask, when is Joey Diaz?

Speaker 6:          01:50:59       Colin, why can't you bring Joey Diaz at the comedy works? He has never been allowed to do that. Ever since I've been performing. So she told a bunch of. It was the woman who owns the club. Right. And it would have happened with some girl ran down and jumped and when I went to grab her I grabbed her ass. There was a kid there that was like in the same league as me. We're starting to get star spots and he was kind of weird about star spots. That's what they call them. Guest spots. Comedy works in those days. That's when you did Thursday. You were good enough to do Thursday, Wednesday and Tuesday. And we do like 10 minutes, right? Ten minutes and you get off. And Wendy liked me. Wendy likes Italian guys, you know who she likes to? East Coast and she like rocky whatever the porch.

Speaker 6:          01:51:35       She likes those guys. Right? So she kinda liked me and this guy kept seeing it. And one day I hear that shit. I'm supposed to open up with George Lopez. I got a call from Wendy. I did sexual harassment, sexual harassment as well. The girl, what girl came in here. So I got the whole story, but a bunch of comics had seen the girl jump into me and me grab arrest. We were partying. It's like be us being at the store and Katie can you and running to you and when she jumps at you grab it. Right? So the girl didn't say nothing that night. She didn't say nothing. We kept drinking and we did a couple of lines. Three days later she was silent with sexual harassment because one of the comedians talked her into it. He's like building. That was sexual harassment you should call Wendy.

Speaker 6:          01:52:15       So she called. That's what happened. That's all I want. That's all it was. And even at now. But that's not even what it was. That sexual harassment is sexual harassment. Harassment is whatever you. What's the definition of it though, isn't it? Well, I always assume that it's someone who has power over someone and like, like a boss that's like saying stupid sexual shit to an employee any unwanted. The fact that she ran towards and on, she read souls. The thing was that saint can't be sexual harassment. It doesn't really matter. It doesn't really matter. Girl, the fucking buddy told her and when the shit and told me I couldn't come in and that, you know. And then you went on the radio and then you signed the radio. You know what, I'm a thief. I'll fucking shoot you if I have to. I'm not a sexual predator.

Speaker 6:          01:52:58       So for that fat to say something like that is fucking wrong, but let me give you the flip side. She's still stuck with her fat ass and then when I'm here living in my fucking life. So she did me a favor. The best thing about what's going on in that was going to kill my ex wife, my ex wife or husband. I was going to kill him. I was already content to get a fax machine and write jokes for fucking Leno. They weren't going to present me what they were doing for my daughter. I was gonna have my buddies chip in $10. It was 94. I wasn't having to get me a fax machine that was going to be in jail. Writing jokes for them. I already had a plan and really. And one day I actually caught myself saying, all right, I'll just kill him because I can't kill her.

Speaker 6:          01:53:35       I know what it is to live without a fucking mother, so I can't kill the mother. And I said, Nah, just kill him. And I went down there one day with a fucking butch and I. it's just that you don't normally do. When I get a beef up my hand, I took a butcher knife and I smacked him with two felonies. I had two felonies in boulder and he caught. I picked up my daughter at the daycare. My daughter got into the car and we're driving and she goes, Daddy, what's a spic? And I go, where'd you hear that? And she goes, whenever you call the house, that's what John says. Close the fucking door. Those was the Washington speakers. I drove with a Safeway member. You know, you'd never go out to the baseline and 28th street, that's where it had a returner. I used to get my daughter on Sundays and Wednesdays, so there's one Wednesday and pull up my little girl in the car.

Speaker 6:          01:54:14       She got a little princess solution three, maybe four, get out of the car and I go, what did he say? She goes, Spit Daddy. What does that mean? I get out of the car, I'd go up to my mommy and she something. John, did you say speak in front of my daughter? And he goes, no, I didn't think. Well, she's three and she's never been to New York. So you got some explaining to do. And he goes, well, I didn't say it Joe. I go, well, you got a problem. Just tell me you said it and we'll end this, but if you keep sitting there telling me you didn't say this, I'm going to fucking knock you out. So one more time, did you say spic in front of my daughter? And he said, no, Joe Rogan. I lick this mother fucked up right there in the safeway parking lot with two shots to the fuck.

Speaker 6:          01:54:52       And then Bam, but that blind people yell and leave him alone. I'm like, fuck you bitch. And all this. In the middle of all this, I turn around and look at the client. I said, my little three year old princess bride. She was scared when I was five and six. I see my stepdad blast motherfuckers with your flapping hands on the street. I seen him shoot a gun on 48th street and I would say to me, I was raised. I was a fucking animal. I didn't want my daughter to go through that barrow at this time already. She was already seeing this shit. Now I smacked his fucking dude I had to go to. They didn't give me a ticket because if you check bold and next time you go. If you use a racial epithet and the city limits of bold that you got get what's coming to you.

Speaker 6:          01:55:35       Really? Yeah. So when there's something, cause he called you a Spec, you were allowed to beat him. My one clean when he went to court the next day with the black eye according to the judge even said, next time you call somebody a fucking racial epitaph, you got won't come at all because ofj dot j. Dot Flannigan. Nineteen 87. A football player in the early, in the late eighties that a lot of problems in boulder with the black football players. They were up there fucking those white chicks three at a time banging them j dot j Dot Flanagan, Kuneva Mcgee, and one kid says something. The Jj flank called him a nigger and he smacked him. The kids. I fucking flew up. Kids fucking. I flew out of his fucking head. I flew out of his fucking head. So something happened after that. They made it the judge j Dot j Dot Flannigan law that you can't say a racial epitaphs.

Speaker 6:          01:56:19       They sided with him in the city of Lynwood inside with him, but some fucking word man. Yeah, I agree. Don't say it. It's not nice, but that's the knocked out. At the time I was going to kill my ex wife and her fucking boyfriend at one side of me at the time. I'm going to kill these motherfuckers joined. I'm telling you, this is sincerity of my heart. Everybody. Nobody was going to fuck with me. That's the way my mother raised me. So this is after he called you a Spec. You want him to kill him? I was still gonna hunt them down. I still had a plan for hunt them down. I was in a hunt him down. I was. So what was going on though? You're white. You broke up with your wife and my wife broke up and then this new guy came in, the pit them against my wishes on whatnot.

Speaker 6:          01:56:56       She told me she wasn't going to date. Nobody for me. Not to date, nobody. I got into comedy and then one day she came to me when I was at a conference with the broker and she goes, I was late for hours because I had a date and that's how the war started and she moved my daughter in there and here's how the war started. White come from. You can't move my daughter into somewhere though, some man's house. She, if she's with your daughter, you think she should have been by herself forever? No, you come to me and talk to me like a man, you're going to move my daughter into another man's house. Understand me. That I don't give me the tricky. No, no, no, no, no. It's not tricky. That's my daughter. I paid child support before you move into another motherfuckers house. Don't say tricky because if it happens to you, you understand the feeling, still triggered all know the feeling and when you pick up your and that was like another man so nobody could judge me on this.

Speaker 6:          01:57:43       Nobody. I don't ever want to hear it from nobody knows until you know that feeling. Don't you ever say nothing to me ever until you know the feeling when you pick up your fucking daughter and she smells like another man. Joe, I'm sure somebody can say something to me, but until then, don't ever say something like that. But this woman is allowed to live her life. She's a lot to live her life, so she. You think she's got to get your permission before she came in with a man? What are you especially is raising the girls. That's where it gets tricky. Support. You were fucking joint. So what does that mean? Joint fucking custody. You still cost money to raise the kid and she lives with a guy constantly. I understand, but I'm paying child support. What? I don't know how that works. What do you mean a woman can not just moving your daughter's room with a man is illegal.

Speaker 6:          01:58:25       It's it. It's us. You just can't wake up one day and your daughter moves a fucking. What is her? What are her rights or her legal? No, I didn't quote Perry. Mason. I, I'm, I'm from the street of rights to come through like a man. But you know what I'm saying? Joey, if she doesn't want to deal with you anymore, if she doesn't want to deal with you anymore, she wants a minute ago with the guy, she has to get your permission. You want to do whatever the fuck you want to do. You do the fuck you want to do, but you can't take your daughter into some other woman's house will. I've seen that woman and saying, Hey, I got a woman and I want to. That's all I'm asking from anybody. That's it just commonly looked at me in the eye. Don't give me no bullshit, bro.

Speaker 6:          01:59:01       This is what men don't tell me. You asked somebody if your daughter and your wife are going to move in with a guy right now when you want to come to you and the Lord Christ. Joey, what are you? You're getting in an argument with someone who's not even. I'm arguing with society. I understand. That's what I'm saying. It's hard to listen to the saying to me that, yeah, you get crazy right? A woman has a right to be away from my man and what is she going to go? She's raising a kid out less. You got to. When you. When a woman wants to leave another Dick, that's one thing. You don't have to tell me nothing. You're moving your daughter. She's three or four. You got to come. Well, I. I agree that it's got to be a very hairy situation to have some man around your child, especially when you know that he's talking some shit about you and he's was raising your daughters terrible before somebody moves.

Speaker 6:          01:59:49       You're kidding with another person. They should contact you and say, Hey, I fell in love with somebody. I want to move my kid in there, but most women make the mistake when they get separated, the jump in the sack with somebody just to hurt the other person. I've seen it a thousand times. Do you think that's why they do it? They just know they do it because they want to jump into bed with somebody that you know, think about all the time. Look at what happened with being candid. His wife jumped into bed with Zulu nation and he fucked cane. What? Dean Kane came home one day and he didn't know who the fuck knows this story? Well, I'm telling you were right. He's like, it's like, no. Come on. Everybody knows the dean, George Washington, the apple tree details Zulu nation. He came home one day. Christmas had moved the kid in with another guy.

Speaker 6:          02:00:29       You know, he came home and the wife had moved the kid and with another guy and whatever the fuck. You know what I'm saying? They were separated and she moved in with another fucking guy. He did the same thing. He took the bits of the court and took a fucking jeep. You did everything. You cannot. You have to come to me though with without the court. So that's the. That's the problem where I lacked. I don't understand court. I don't understand. Cool. We're friends. Don't hit me with court. I know you're 20 years used to suck my dick and I used to eat your ass. Whoa. Whoa. You don't have to go to cloud. Have a relationship with this man. I'm missing what I'm trying to say. She's had a good time with Joe. Did assistant position at this time in my life. When did that favor by banning me.

Speaker 6:          02:01:07       She doesn't mean she made you leave Denver. She took me a fucking favor. Look where I am now, but you fucking mom was smoking dope. Not Good. Dope. But I'm having a good fucking time. The reason this, this crazy fucking argument with nobody just got started. The story got started because of the paramount. Bob, I'm just telling you the truth. September 23rd paramount there. Joe Diaz returns to out there. Say, hurry up. It's almost so bad. Oh Joe, you asked me what was going on. You asked me and I'm telling you I didn't know that we're going to fuck around with people you want to know. I tell the St Joe jokey pools or nothing. She'll keep it match what happened with me. So when they came to me and said you got thrown out of the end of economy was I was bummed out for like two weeks, but I knew I was losing the war over there because I wasn't going to lose that.

Speaker 3:          02:01:53       Glad you never killed anybody want to come back with a hand? Was there any kind of love interest between you and Wendy at any time? No. You sure? Did you ever kiss her? No. Nothing because that's what I heard. I heard that there was some kindness and you didn't hear that. Did you hear that? He's been in fucking jail. I wonder when people yell at, you know, I swear to God. I swear to God though. What'd you hear? I heard that, that they were like kind of fucking around with each other. I don't know who told me, but somebody told me, you told you. Nobody told him that. He's just trying to. You? No I don't. He's not going nowhere with it. Stop. It's not cute. It ain't gonna fuck. I swear to you. Make it funny.

Speaker 6:          02:02:30       What are you still people at Rogen on? You ain't even funny. Stop it. Stop it.

Speaker 1:          02:02:35       People are explaining me. Hash online and there's nothing more than compressed keef or thc extracted from plant material says high tech con man. People are also telling me that there's many different kinds of Hash tricombs and yeah, I guess some people actually do call it resin. It's not resonate as a. I understand resin I think. I think. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          02:02:57       tell them about the shit that I was getting with the fucking stamp. Hello? Knows about that shit. It's just like, it's just like the Olympic

Speaker 6:          02:03:05       fixed. They would stamp it with like, you know, it would be like the medium grade would be bronze, medium will be serving the best would be like Goldman. They used to have them. I have a platinum coding, so that's how you judge Hash in the old days when you got it, people would say, oh yeah, fucking platinum. You can't get no that. So that's, that's the emperor. I'm not kidding. These are jokes. The emperor, wherever it would make the hash, before they shipped it over here, they would stamp it for your approval and that's what you always wanted to get. You always wanted to get the hash with the stamp.

Speaker 1:          02:03:31       What I was talking about earlier, Oklahoma, Oklahoma Senate approves life in prison for making hash of you make Hash. They will give you life in prison. That's amazing. It's amazing how stupid they are in Oklahoma. That is so fucking dumb. They think that somehow or another, this is some dangerous drug. Who Do they think this is math? What do you get from making meth in Oklahoma? Because if you get life in jail for if you get life in jail for making hash, they should shoot everyone you've ever met. If you make meth, they should kill you and then shoot everyone you've ever met. Everyone you love should die for shut. The Hash has never killed anybody. The only times I was smoking hash and I'm like, I've just said, wow, I'm really high. That's it.

Speaker 6:          02:04:14       Hash is really good. If you work at your store, you eat little pieces of it. Oh God. The next day you wake up, often

Speaker 1:          02:04:21       there's a beautiful fucking story on a kid who had autism and his parents were given them hash and it killed his autism. It's amazing. The kid like wouldn't interact with anybody. The black chicks I did. No, no, no. It was a different one. So different was a white kid. It was a guy in northern California and he cut a little tiny piece of hash and he would stick it inside of a melon and he would give it to his boy and all the sudden this kid was interacting with people and he was calm. He was relaxed and there was another one with a black kid to where they're given a medical marijuana. Meanwhile, in Oklahoma, that's shit puts you in life. In prison in April 20. First of 2011. That's an Oklahoma. So not anymore. Not Anymore. There's certain places where somebody else might. They got to get this test for welfare. I like it. That's a good move. That's a fucking bull. Welfare is such a tricky thing because I love the idea that people can count on people to help them out if something goes wrong, but human nature is a motherfucker and human nature is. If you give people the ability to not work there, they're going to take it.

Speaker 1:          02:05:27       I never understood. People went there and said, I claimed craziness. That's $600 a month so you don't have to work and you're crazy. You're getting $6. You can't live on that, so I don't understand why you're jumping up and down so happy for. Some people are happy just to know a month or something. I just seen him about a year ago on TV. If you claim craziest 6:40 and those people in that documentary I was talking about earlier were documentaries that I think we're alone. How they made their money. They claim crazy. Yeah. Well because they're not claiming it because they had that asperger's or whatever it's called asperger's. You can get money from you. Look, I think you should be able to get some money if there's something fucked up with you and we should help each other out. We should help out our brothers and sisters.

Speaker 1:          02:06:09       The problem is, like I said about hippies. The problem is it's beautiful if everybody helps. If you've got a circle and everybody's handing out love to the left and like man, here have some live, it's going to come around back to you. It's all. We're all community, right? But with hippies, a lot of hippies when they're in a circle and they're handing out love to the left, the love gets to them and they step out of the circle and walk away and they take that love and they don't pass it around and they're always taking and not giving and that's something that happens when you have a welfare situation. You have people who. It's nice if we all help each other out, but some people just, they're greedy and they take that money and they just. They think that somehow or another deserve it and other people, they use it as a crutch.

Speaker 1:          02:06:49       Well, I don't have to work because now I got money. There's so many flaws in human beings and and just just human behavior. It's hard to make something like welfare work. It's hard to make it work the way it's supposed to work. Here's the way it's supposed to work, right? Here's the way society is supposed to work. We are supposed to live in tribes of 50 people. That's how it's supposed to work. We're not supposed to be connected. Three hundred fucking million of us all on this one patch of dirt. That is pro postures. The idea of a fucking community that has 300 million people have it is ridiculous, especially when people go on Rob, rob, bullshit and fuck you. So you will say, no, no, no, no. That's. That's crazy. You can't have everybody in. You can't have everybody in the same fucking team. It's not that you shouldn't be one community in your community, should compete against every other community.

Speaker 1:          02:07:39       You could all have be under the same idea, our umbrella, but the fact that all people are responsible for all the rest of the people, $300, million, it's too many. There's too many. There's too much room for craziness and douchebags and too much neglect and there's not enough people that are good enough focus or attention. It's just the numbers are too vast for a human being, a human being belongs in a tribe of small people, but the fact that there's so many of us are a small tribe of 50 people, but the fact that so many of us that we kind of are forced into this situation where we interact on a daily basis with millions of people that we have no idea who the fuck they are. We don't know anything about them and yet we're all combined under the same group. That's crazy.

Speaker 1:          02:08:20       That's when welfare becomes nuts because you're getting money from some people. You don't even fucking know these people. Fuck those people. Give me my money. You know? Instead of being in a tribe of 50 people, they go, hey man, why aren't you doing your work? You need to contribute. We're a part of a community. And then you feel it. You feel that your. Yeah, I am slacking. Yeah. If there was 10 people on an island and one person was sitting around, you know, if they all got shipwrecked and one person was sitting around going, yeah, bring me my fish year, where's my water? You'd go, we got to kill that guy. That guy's not using. He's not helping. You know, he's using up our valuable resources. We have to risk our lives fishing and getting water and this just sits around doing. You'd want to kill him, but in a society with 300 million people, it just becomes another thing you just told me. Do you know how easy

Speaker 6:          02:09:03       they make it for you? I don't know about now, but because what's going on? But you know how easy they make it. For some people, just verizon. I'll tell you how easy it is so you can really shit your pants because I really always dropped some money. When you get out of prison, no matter how old you are, you going there for heck of a mass followed with a Dui. You come out when you're 26, you could do paperwork and claim disability because you're a convicted felon for the rest of your life. What disability law, how is it a disability that you're convicted? Thought of them will say they can't get the job because they're felons who's going to hire a felon, so you get disability or $600 a month. You probably just want to keep you from robbing somebody. That's probably the logic. Not going to do it.

Speaker 6:          02:09:45       What's he going to do if you're on to give you a little something. So it was really weird. I remember leaving there, but when my mother died, she worked under her alias. My mother had an alias all those years because after she stabbed the guy in Cuba and she came back, she had to change her name because she came back with her friend's ID. My Jimmy runs Jesus Christ deal. But it was funny that I had a fight for social security when my mother died and I was 15. I needed the money. Like I went there 10 times to fight them and oh, we don't know what the fuck. Don't you know, at least give me a $200. I didn't need the money Joe, but it was just so weird that finally when they're selling me this, I'd go steal for a living. I go sold drugs. I never took after all the drama they put me through for social security, but they give it to me after I got a felony. Wow. Just like that

Speaker 1:          02:10:34       for the rest of my life. $600 a month. That would get on the fifth of every month and if you claim that they talk about the different disabilities and the difference, you could get up to like $1,200 a month. I wonder if people were ever going to evolve to the point where a society actually can work if like what our problem is is that society and cities and these giant ideas of countries, they happen so quickly and the development of the human animal that we, we, we, we haven't really evolved enough with our minds and our behavior to, to, to operate, like to operate really in a harmonic way with a society. And that's why there's all this crime. And that's why there's all this bullshit. That's why there's all these things that would not be tolerated in the natural group of 50 people that all know each other and love each other and support each other like we are.

Speaker 1:          02:11:23       We're designed to operate in tribes. It's very obvious. Everybody wants to be on a team. Everybody wants to have a family, everybody wants to have friends. Everybody wants to have a group. You know where the death squad look. I mean we are like a little family. We call ourselves a death squad. All of us together, you know. And the reason why we call it with Opi from opiod anthony named is that. And like 19 fucking whatever the hell it was, 2003 or whatever it was. I came in with Eddie Bravo and tate and you know, when he goes, oh, it's Joe Rogan and his death squad. And then we're like, that's hilarious. Does squad, because we were giggling, we were like a cost offset. Desk Squad were the desk right now and it sounds so stupid, but we call ourselves that and we have this desk squad podcast network and all that, but all this group of comics that we all hang out together.

Speaker 1:          02:12:03       We are like this, this little tribe. We all liked this little family. It's like a natural thing, but it's not natural to do it with 300 million people. If we were all together and we all lived together, it would be normal. We all love each other. We all take care of each other. We look out for each other. If something's happening to one of us, we want to help, you know that's. That's normal shit. I wonder if if it's ever going to get to the point where we could operate like that with 300 million people because it obviously doesn't work right now when you have crime, but it's that, but I don't want to say never because I think that human interaction and what where we are right now is so different than where it was in the thirties and the twenties in the fifties and just really 10 years ago.

Speaker 1:          02:12:46       Social Media and the interaction that we have with human beings today, the interaction that we have on with just with twitter alone, it's so different than than human beings who grew up in a different generation that didn't have this and our connection with each other is very different than people that grew up in a different generation and I think that that's part of the evolution of the human being and I think that human beings are slowly trying to figure out how to work together in these big giant ass fucking groups. I don't think it's impossible. It obviously depends on raising children correctly and not developing incredibly fucked up human beings that are a liability, but that's possible too. You grew up fucked up and you're not a liability. You know what I mean? Thinking about the craziest stories you've told just today about wanting to kill people, smacking people, the fact that you're a criminal and a thief and that you've been to jail and all these different things, but yet here you are hanging out at my house.

Speaker 1:          02:13:41       She went on to my best friends. You're very productive. You're a fucking beautiful standup comedian, you're a great guy, you've got a great podcast, you know what I'm saying? Like you pulled it together to become something different. And Brian, you know, coming from fucking Columbus, Ohio and working in a fucking gateway and being stuck in this town and you know, and being surrounded by a bunch of knuckleheads, you've pulled it together, you've become someone different. We all evolve. We all move into some new phase of life and interact with everybody that's around us in a very different way. Is that possible on a mass level? Is that possible as a society that we all hold each other accountable, all of us individually. And you become 300 million people together. No, no, no,

Speaker 6:          02:14:25       no. We come from a society where people don't give a fuck with two fucking selfish. Some computers and shit. I've separated us even more. I think they can separate us even more. I like human contact. I do too, but I like this. My computer guy was really good too. And I said to Eddie, Eddie, can you call and you take a picture and this is something that we. You said to me when that, can you take a picture and put it on twitter? And he goes, yeah, my wife goes, you could do it too. And I said, you don't want. But I'm out. I'm living my life. I don't want to be beat a fucking computer when I'm out. That means you're not fucking livid when I'm out of my house. I don't want to say twitter. I don't want to see facebook. I don't want to seem nothing.

Speaker 6:          02:15:00       I'm living my fucking life. That's what the problem is, that people are not living no more. They were on these fucking things too much and it's losing a little bit of human touch. That's what we all do. That's what I feel I feel between the texting and a lot of stuff. It cuts time, but we'll losing human contact. It's making us lazy. A couple of years ago, commercial came out and it was about a business and the guy goes, I'm having a meeting. And he started giving away plane tickets and the people will like, the salesmen were like, Whoa, what's this? And he goes, we've lost our fucking human [inaudible]. Everything is a twit or a fucking email or something. We're going to go back to belly to belly sales to, to, to look at people in the fucking eye and talk to people again. And, and that's, I mean, we're so lose now, this fucking crime.

Speaker 6:          02:15:40       They're jumping up and down and fucking England. Mexico's as volatile as it's ever been. We're in no danger. We can't even drive in fucking Hollywood because people won't even put that fucking blinkers on. They're so selfish. That's the first way of changing Joe. The way I changed was to start from scratch. If you can't pick up a piece of paper as you're walking, you're not going to change if you can't. You know, I used to, when I got the longest shot and I used to go to all these meetings in Hollywood and you go to all these meetings and every fucking meeting you go to some dumb motherfucker shows up 20 minutes late and says to you, well, what's the traffic one? Motherfucker, you live in La, you and guess what? I started doing joe. I started being laid and then one day I caught myself and I go, you don't want. This is what I'm talking about. For me to be a better productive, I have to show people, not tell them, show people, and now when I get to a meeting and you're 20 minutes late, I say

Speaker 4:          02:16:30       I say something to you because we're men. That's how character you never like an angry is he today and never very angry, very angry, never let your character ruin your destiny. And it all starts with little things. It doesn't start with being a fake and it starts with little things. It's character is what people don't see you doing. It's the things that pit and that's what we've forgotten. Driving Hollywood the other day. Data was eight, conquer lap. Okay, I agree. I think that there's definitely people need character joey, but you're discounting the idea that technology is connecting people and that's ridiculous. You're discounting the idea that twitter connects people in the facebook connects people. Yes, you should have human interaction and you know what? You should have human interaction showing up dog to people making. So you got a couple of idiots parking. No, that doesn't mean that there's not a trend of interconnection.

Speaker 4:          02:17:20       Douchebag, mothers, some of them, some of them. Not. Everybody starts and we want to make the world a lot better. Starts with the little things. We could talk all this nonsense to people because before it all starts with you dog. Oh my God. Because the word, all these people are, you know, so kind of a world and all this shit. In the last. I've never seen him angry. I believe in doing. I'm. I know. But Joey, we're talking about a positive thing and all of a sudden you turned anything. We talk about into something where you're yelling at someone. No, no, no. I'm not yelling at me, isn't it Brian? I'm passionate about something. I'm not. Y'All understand what I'm saying? Everything is some fucking molds. Just fucking idiot. Compassion. I'd done it. I understand the fuck to tell you. You want me to be honest with you on your podcasts, right?

Speaker 4:          02:18:00       If not, you quote one of your buddies. Joey. I want you to be honest, but I think we should be able to discuss ideas with you screaming about some personal. I understand why you got to get me real stone when I get here though. That's what happened. Did you say you peed on yourself? I peed on myself. How did you do that? Fucking sleeping. Woke up. I was so cold in your bed. The in my bed. I beat up because I had the sleep apnea mask on. So beat up word fuck in the pants with purpose. Oh yeah, yeah, I'd do that every day. I was asleep. I was, you know, sometimes my room, my room was fucking 50 below zero it now. So some nights at six. I'm like to the what is your wife? Did she bundle up bumble up big time? She was so she bundles up saying you get that AC cranked on winter.

Speaker 4:          02:18:47       How many cats are sleeping with you when you're doing this? To only to your same two every time. Yeah, and the other. The other nine don't get embarrassed about with the cold and cold there. They find they can't take the cold there. Sometimes I get up and move on that my wife has gone. How do you keep your, your place from smelling my cat shit because I have a problem with my fucking office. Clean. You clean it every day, right? Everyday. If you're a filthy animal, that's what happened to change every day. It's still stinks. No like shit. Every time I. my little girl, she loves wet food will spazz. She loves wet food, but when I give her that wet food, God damaged the wet food will kill you, but they love it. They love it. I only give her wet food every couple of days.

Speaker 1:          02:19:28       Get these achievement house. I pay a little extra for these crystals. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          02:19:32       right now. Do you like the Blue Crystal? Are you talking about the blue light will watch them. Shit. Just like we do a podcast once a while, all about a cat called podcasts and that's all we were like. We talked about litter control and thing. You don't get one of those electric ones that like a month and they didn't

Speaker 1:          02:19:55       do. You have a litter box with a dome over it. You have got to have that. I got four dorms. I got one day. They say, oh, it's a carbon filter. My little girl, that little spasm, she will make the stinky shit. I almost get upset at her, you know, but no, you can't get up such. As soon as I smell something, I'll clean it out. I got to scoop it out and flushing, but it stinks to do. I scoop it out and flushing and I changed every two days, but I stay on it. It's just so gross as creepy little animals. They're in there scratching on the Shitty fucking glitter and pissy litter and then they get out and just walk around your house. Shitty litter and pissy little pause and it's, you know,

Speaker 3:          02:20:33       definitely. He definitely has feline virus for sure. Sure. Honestly, I think this will be great for the podcast, get it tested and we give it like live results. Those don't know

Speaker 1:          02:20:46       we're talking about. There's a cat parasite called toxo plasma. Look it up on the Internet. A lot of people infected by this cad parasite and it alters human behavior and it makes you more impulsive and crazy and that's probably true.

Speaker 3:          02:20:57       Make girls more submissive. Guys. Keep believing that dumb shit. You keep believing what toxoplasma. It's 100 percent true. No, it's not. It's 60 million Americans. I've had cats. Was six fucking Joey. It also makes your wife or your girlfriend whatever. You were saying that. No, no, no, no, no fact that says days are over when you come. Correct. Because if not, I walk out of the fucking room. Shelly toxo plasma is nonsense. Now I got a cat disease. What I might cat, man, listen to you talk. That sounds exactly like they say what? Someone who can aggravate someone who has a cat disease talks exactly like that. I know, I know. That's what it is. Look Joey, a lot of people have it. They don't know that they have it. I'm sure I have it. Sixty dollars million

Speaker 1:          02:21:41       Americans have it. Sixty dollars million. No, no. What do you mean here?

Speaker 3:          02:21:45       They all. They all got iphone. So what time you got time for you to go home? What is it? 10, 15, 55. Zero. You should do this with your wife earlier. It's awesome to have her put her mouth inside of your mouth and talk inside your mouth. It's cool. Okay. Jesus fucking Christ. Breads. You wonder why people yell at you. You wonder why people yell at you. Knock it. You'll like it. No. What? No one talks inside my mouth. Dude. Echoes in the head. It's so creepy sounding. This what I'm saying? Just try it out. Make sure there's no errors. Fight in this podcast. We have really covered the full spectrum of welfare and black people in the movie

Speaker 5:          02:22:25       theaters and stabbing people walking in air conditioning. There is air conditioning here. Believe it or not. And we've covered everything. We've covered it all folks. And you know, it's been a wild ride. And uh, I enjoyed it. So most of the time, most of the time it was a few times. I love it when Joey Diaz goes crazy. It's one of my favorite things ever. Yeah. I love when you go off to, but you know there's no absolutes on these. I love you to death, Bro. You invite me up here, but have you got to get me in here and good shit from the jump. You know how I roll? I can't have that shit that you had this guy got to get the a one weed and calm me down.

Speaker 2:          02:25:23       see. Either way. Shizam Salaam Alaikum. Big Kiss, Tmr Mama. Anything to say? Brian? I love the fleshlight Joey Diaz. Jordan. I liked j dot ward. You don't lecture anymore anymore. He's think he got a little crazy when a little baby. Did he get a little, you know, there was a little twitter war out of nowhere. You want to explain that. He said, all right, here's the whole j dot region in nutshell. He's friends with Tom Segura, right? And Tom's like, hey, can you please help Jay Mohr out, give them some information. He wants to do a podcast if he could just talk to him. So I was like, yeah, sure. I'm to give me a call. He calls me up. I'm like, Hey, you know, I'm really busy but I can lead you in the right direction if I ever have any free chance. I'll help you out here and there and stuff like that.

Speaker 2:          02:26:07       He goes, well, can you just email me all the things I need? So I emailed them like some some equipment that he should buy on Amazon.com. Amazon Dot Com gave him a web host that he should go. And then he wrote me back like, hey, how much this is, all this stuff costs. And I'm like, well, just click on the links, you know. Anyways. So I wrote back and said he asked you to add it all up. Yeah. Yeah. He and he, uh, how did he say? He's like, Hey, can you add that all up for me? Or something like that. Can you add that all? Yeah, like he wanted me to click on all the links and added up for him for some reason. Wow. That's asking a lot. Well, it's asking a lot from a guy you don't know, don't know. The guy's sudden you, you went out of your way to provide him with all the information.

Speaker 2:          02:26:42       And it was like, I don't know, this guy, I'm doing this favor. I had to go on Amazon, find links and copy and paste and actually spend some time like for a complete stranger, you know? Right. And so then he said, you've never met Jane Moore, never met j dot Moore. I sold them and he says, can you add all this shit up? Yeah. And so, and I said, you know, look, I, I, because I think he was kind of confused with everything. He's like, you. I said, hey, if you want to use my studio, you can use it anytime you want to, you know, and he completely ignored that and he goes, hey, you know, stepping yet another email. We're on the road at the time I missed his last email he sent me. I didn't even know he sent it to me. Come to like a month or two later Thompson.

Speaker 2:          02:27:18       He goes, can you please write jay more a real, like a letter detailing everything he needs to do to do a podcast. I'm like, okay, I'll make it super detailed. No, that's fine. Get on itunes on Itunes, do this. Take the SD card. Actually was saying take the SD card out of your computer, you know, like it was that detailed. I was writing it and then like two days later I'm still writing this letter a, I see that he has a podcast. So I just like, Oh I guess with Kevin Smith. So I'm like, you know what, I don't have to send this out anymore. So I just ignored it. And then I noticed he started tweeting me like fucking crazy, like tagging me if you search his timeline since March, he's tweeted my names and their 24 times I've never tweeted that jude wants all right.

Speaker 2:          02:28:03       I don't know this guy. Right. So then finally I'm on my birthday weekend and I'm out of town. I'm at Disneyland and I'm like looking at my phone and it's like, fuck you red ban, you know, once you return a phone call. And he's like saying I don't return phone calls, check my phone records. He's not called. I've talked to him once on the phone. He's never called me again. So he's like making up all this shit and telling me to fuck off and about. I have no idea. But you know, from, from, from the people that came to me after that, like a lot of, a big comedians came to me and was like, dude, you know, we, I have problems with him, you know, f this guy. Don't, don't worry. Doesn't like them. Yeah. Stan hope doesn't like him. That's pretty well known.

Speaker 2:          02:28:41       But uh, yeah, I mean it's, you know what? I don't know what his problem is. I have no problem with the guy. I just, you know, he had a little hissy fit and now just so I wouldn't it though, it doesn't make sense that he would just go after you on twitter like that and he was like, be a man while he's going after you on twitter and he's saying that I'm not returning calls. I'm making a pretty much fake bullshit. How weird is it to, to go after someone on twitter saying you're not calling me? Yeah, like, that's, that's weird to will be a man. Are you going after someone on twitter? And I liked Jay. I've never had a single problem with Jay. Jay Moore and I have always been cool. I was looking forward to having him on the podcast and I actually wrote him a message saying, Hey, let's work this out next week.

Speaker 2:          02:29:21       I'm busy with fear factor. I'll call you soon. And then right after I wrote that, then I read all these tweets that you and him were going back and forth with wasn't doing shit. He, towards you were just getting tweeted at when he was calling you a bitch or whatever the fuck he was saying to you and I was like, this is just weird. Did he get drunk or something and just know from what people have been telling me that he has a, a, a side of him where he spazzes out and uh, this is normal for him. Like I guess like he just goes after people. He just has a temper, you know, you have problems with them.

Speaker 5:          02:29:58       I've just made a lot of people know, you know, your buddy now. Either people is that magical problems with them? I don't know. Problems. I just avoid them. When you told them you're buddying up with them. I just closed my fucking head because I knew that was going to be a disaster because just, just why? Why? Well, I was just going to do his podcast. So I like him. I looked at, I said, I think he's funny. He's got great impressions. That dude that does the best. Christopher walken on the fucking face of the planet. He's a, he's got a Hilarious Colin Quinn, his Collin Quinn is. This is funny as colony Quinn. I mean I think he's a talented guy. He's Kevin. I don't know. It's not the commerce. Oh, look what I know. I know that's the problem. I have to judge them. I have to judge them based on my interactions and my interactions with him have always been cool.

Speaker 5:          02:30:47       He's always been nice to me. I've never had a problem with them. He's always been cool with me, but you know, I don't like reading all that shit. I don't like seeing anybody doing shit like that. But you did that to Brian to you know, you, you wouldn't have to Brian to on twitter just the same way back, but it's the same fucking way he went after him on twitter the exact same way that you're criticizing right here. First of all, I didn't know what was really going on and if you want to really know Brian, it was these motherfuckers that got us all going because me and you will cool. Who's calling me back? All these outside forces that we call our [inaudible] friends

Speaker 4:          02:31:20       were the ones that with twitter, me and st all this shit. So next time you sit on a fucking tell you and that's why I got pissed off when I went to Jerry's that night and that dude came up to me. That's what got me pissed off because you're my brother. You want me? Never had a fucking problem. We goof around all the fucking time. That's why when, when they told me that you were furious and stuff, I got hurt. I called you right away. I called you right away. There's no. You know what I mean? I call or I show up. That's the worst thing about it. I love showing up. Guys. Just haven't found it right here, bro. I love you to death. And then I left him like every fucking nothing like that though. I know. You know. Listen Bro. That's why I don't deal with a lot of these fucking guys because I know it's going to end up and this is the type of person I am. I don't know how that deal. I don't know how to argue that. I don't know how to go to court. I don't know how to play those games. Those are not games that I grew up plan. So when people throw that at me or be bureaucratics, whatever the fuck that word is, I can't deal with that. Talk to me. I know, I know, but just come talk to me like a man because if you don't know that, I suspect

Speaker 5:          02:32:24       if they don't come talk to me like a man, Brian,

Speaker 4:          02:32:27       they don't come talk to you like a man. Then you got to suspect that containers and then you don't want after a while they want to do it on them because I know like my mom used to say if it sucks in the beginning it's gonna suck all the way through. So just leave it alone. If you have a bad week the first day with them, you know what? This is going to suck all the way through. So let's just shaking part friends because why put yourself

Speaker 5:          02:32:49       through the shit before I start getting angry at someone is not here again. I'll tell you, I was fucking 12 years old. I told that cock sucker. Then I'll tell you now, ladies and gentlemen, play the music. Let's, let's wrap this bitch up. Let's bring this mother fucker home. Let's bring it home in a positive direction. Joe Diaz, and I know you said something on twitter the other day that people will talk about positivity or probably concert. They all really are really, really. I talk about that shit. You gotta lighten up, but you got to stop beating on my fucking cough drops. You came over here and yellow, 100,000 negative things today. Don't you tell me what to be positive and negative.

Speaker 5:          02:33:31       No, it helps people. It helps people recognize that other people like to think that way too. Yeah, yeah. I'm talking about whatever the fuck I want. I got a podcast. Bitch. You can't stop me. You can't tell me what the fuck they talking about. I'm going to keep it going. I'm going to keep the bumping. Ladies and gentlemen, that squad.
