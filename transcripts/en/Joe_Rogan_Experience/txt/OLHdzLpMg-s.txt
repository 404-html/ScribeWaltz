Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Five, four, three, two, one.

Speaker 2:          00:00:08       Gary Vee. Ladies and gentlemen. Dude, I have gotten so many fucking tweets about you ever since I say we're going to do this podcast or I don't know if I announced it online or tweeted or something. Man, that you are. You're doing something out there. Dude. You got a lot of people behind you. Lot are people excited about you. Well, listen, I'm super thrilled to be here. I, I really appreciate it. I appreciate you being here. I'm thrilled to talk to you. Thanks. You're a motivational motherfucker, man. You got a lot of people up and Adam,

Speaker 1:          00:00:31       I'm super grateful. You know. Do you know it's funny. I, uh, I spent the three years for the last year. I've been okay with it, but the three years prior to that, I specifically didn't want to be a motivational speaker. How come I was selfish in deciding like that? I just didn't want to be that, that I was more proud in my own mind of being an entrepreneur or business builder who happened to have entrepreneurial tendencies. And I feel like the motivational speaker thing, you know, by percentages can get a little ugly, gets a little kind of hollow, a little spammy. And for my own mind, the way I had it, my brand was I suppressed and stop putting out the content like that. I would tell my boys and my internal employees, but for the last year I embraced it a little more. And so, you know, it's got a place, you know, I mean, you can't, I know you feel this because as soon as you announced it too, I've gotten so many emails and tweets and the ems of the same thing, if you're lucky enough that some way, the way you communicate brings value to others.

Speaker 1:          00:01:38       You need to be smart about that. And so I'm trying to figure it out. Yeah. Um, yeah. I mean I definitely think you need to be smart about it. You definitely don't. You don't want to get greedy with it or stupid with it or there's a fine line. But the population and you know, and doing the right thing for sure. And for me, when I go onstage, that is my zone. Like I, that's like, that's my arena, that's my court. I just don't think anybody does it better. Like when you give a motivational speech, usually business talks, but um, so like Rah, Rah, that takes, you know, I feel like I'm a defensive coordinator that's giving you the place, but I'm going to give it to you, like we can do this, let's rip their next, you know, like out of their body. And so when I'm up there that and the youtube videos and things of that nature, that's the majority of what people see of me.

Speaker 1:          00:02:32       And that's the only one version of it. And uh, yeah, I, I, I'm very conscious of the motivational thing. I think a lot of people use motivation for their own selfishness. And I'm trying. I know it all plays out in 30 or 40 years, but along the way for my own appetite, I want to balance it the right way. Well, there's a lot of people that are doing it that haven't, they don't really, they don't really do anything else. Like I know a guy who does motivational speaking, used to be a shitty comedian and now he's just doing these weird motivational speeches and they're like, there's sort of hobbled and cobbled together from other people's Shit. And it's like it's fake. You know what? Listen, I don't judge anybody very honest. I don't give a fuck really. I really don't really. I don't. But about what other people are doing.

Speaker 1:          00:03:19       Entertainment, escapism. Just, you know, people can say reality stars of this. People say watching football, like my beloved jets for three hours of stupid. Like people can judge escapism in any way they want. Here's my big thing. I'm a businessman, so I talk about business content. It's not just finding your inner peace, right? Scares the shit out of me is everybody who fucking says that they're a business coach and they've never made a fucking dollar outside of selling other people how to make a dollar. The scheme is basically sell other people on how to make a dollar. So I just don't want to go down that path and I think I can look the part very quickly and that's why suppressed it for a little while, but then in the last three or four years I've built a very large agency, a media agency, and so I think I felt good that I went and executed again, just like I did when I built the wine business.

Speaker 1:          00:04:07       So I filled that bucket of building another big business, which makes me feel more comfortable to go out and do the content and being out there. Well there's definitely value in giving people motivation is definitely value that other people get from it. It's a real positive thing and there's ripples that come off of that. And I feel like I gained a lot from a lot of people that are motivational. I get a lot out of it. I love it when they're real. When the real. Yeah. It's just, it's hard to find, you know, you've got to separate find out who's a boat, you know, who's a real health expert and who's a bullshit artist that is sort of compiled and remembered a bunch of things that other health experts have actually studied and done headline research on versus practitioners should imagine what you guys are dealing with.

Speaker 1:          00:04:55       Being at the top of the sphere of this important medium, you must get bombarded and it takes work. Like I've been able to navigate who I want to fuck with and have drinks with and who I stay away from. It takes a lot of time. Yeah, does because it can look the part and you got to like dig and then you gotta like take and you know, you know this, there's people that you actually respect who haven't done the work and are lazy about putting somebody else on and our, yeah, that's a good guy, but they're not. And they're like, fuck. I'm like, you know, the whole thing is really interesting. And then there's hosers mess. There's a lot of hoses out there. There's just no, there's no getting away from that though and kind of all walks of life and I think you're right though, did not concentrate on the negative ones because it's really just a waste of resources.

Speaker 1:          00:05:37       It's a waste of energy. But this is an amazing time though to get a message out there and to motivate people and to show people that, you know, there's, there's something positive not just in being inspired buttons. Inspiring others. Yeah. I mean, listen, you know, the communication infrastructure of society is incredibly interesting right now, but you and I are doing, do you know, I mean like if you map what you're doing right now, like it's insane. You, you basically had to give up all the economics to the biggest radio station in the world. Like, like everybody can reach so many people and of course everybody's gonna head's going to go to what's going on in politics and what's going on. And it's true, the reason that dictator when they're creating a coup d'etat wants to take control of the media is because people go with what the media is telling them.

Speaker 1:          00:06:27       And so yeah, I mean I think it's imperatively important to try to navigate and distinguish yourselves. To me, I'm saying this quite a bit lately, which is if you're feeling good right now, it's like, for example, I am, I feel enormously optimistic. You have a massive sense of responsibility to communicate that because the wave of negativity is extreme. Yeah, I agree. I agree. And I think it's super beneficial. And um, you know, what you were saying about the media being powerful. I mean the most powerful thing about it is everyone has access to it now. It was nothing keeping anyone from starting an instagram page and just putting up little videos everyday of how they feel and how they think. And it might only affect one person. It might affect a thousand people, it might get to a million people. And it builds. And what happens, Joe, is I think people look at this in a cynical way.

Speaker 1:          00:07:19       They're like, social media is bad. That person has no talent. Why are they successful? This political thing is going on. That's bad, this is bad. And what they don't realize is these social networks haven't changed us. They've exposed us. You know what people like twitter didn't change your opinions. Twitter allowed you to express them. Back in the day when something was on tv or the radio. We were yelling when I used to listen to sports radio, Mike and the mad dog in the nineties in Jersey, I was yelling back at mad dog, like, you idiot, no, the jets should do this. But now that voice is in play, right? Right. One famous person away from retweeting it to getting the foundation. That's the, you know, that's the match. That can start your infrastructure. Not only is it in play, but if you have opinions on sports, you could start your own podcast and it just builds.

Speaker 1:          00:08:11       And it could be massive in bigger than anything on the radio because it's such a superior medium. People forget that blogging was a precursor to this. I mean, where do you think Bill Simmons came from? People were confused, like people forget real quick. I mean, that was my story. I owned a wine store in Jersey. Youtube came out. It was five months old and I'm like, this thing is going to be big and it's sad to sit in front of a table, drink four bottles of wine for 20 minutes, and it was good enough that a lot of people want to watch what you started out. That's what you started doing. My Mike. So My, if you want to take it all the way back. I was born in Belarus in the former Soviet Union, so I have a very immigrant story. Came to the states in [inaudible] 78. Lived in a studio apartment half the size of this studio with eight family members.

Speaker 1:          00:08:52       Real immigrants. Shit. My Dad got a as a stock boy in a liquor store for two bucks an hour in New Jersey. Wow. Became the manager of that store eventually. You know, that immigrant thing just work every hour. Right? Dad Did. I didn't even know my dad until I was 14 even though he slept in my home every night. And uh, and we moved to Jersey. I was straight entrepreneurial DNA, like lemonade stands, like shoveling snow. I used to rip people's flowers out of their yard and ring the doorbell and sell it back to them. It was real raw entrepreneurship and then I'm 41 baseball cards were like the thing in 87, 88, 89 90. That was culture and I became a baseball card dealer and I was making two, $300 a weekend selling baseball cards in the malls of New Jersey that my dad owned a small liquor store.

Speaker 1:          00:09:37       Eventually in Springfield, New Jersey dragged my ass in. I hated it, but around 16 I realized people collected wine that was connected to what I liked, which was collecting baseball cards and football cards and I at 16 years old, spent every minute of my life trying to become the foremost expert in wine. I would go into like science class junior year and not give a fuck about Saturn and we'll just sit there and read the wine spectator and decided I was going to be the greatest wine retailer of all time. Heard the Internet in [inaudible] 94 in a dorm room playing madden [inaudible] 94. My friend came and he's like, you got to see this, went to a room, heard cooch, that whole thing and 15 minutes in was on a Bolton board and a PSA, seeing that people are selling wine and decided that I would launch a wine website and in 1996 I launched one of the first ecommerce wine businesses in America.

Speaker 1:          00:10:28       Wow. And so then in 98 I came home full time and from 90 to 2003 in that five year window I built my dad's business from a three to a $60,000,000 business on the back of email marketing, google ad words and just having a website and that became my first foray into using technology to grow very quickly. Sell wine through that website. Eat. So buy and sell. I don't know Jack Shit about one I go to. I just asked the guy, what's good dude? Do you like it? Love it. That's all you need to know. The number one reason I broke out in wine. Everyone who's listening right now, real quick, take a step back. Do you know anybody that's into wine? Everybody probably knows one or two people, they know what I know. Every one of those people are street douchebag. Anybody that's really into wine thinks like it's some magical information that they impose on others and they become a straight dick.

Speaker 1:          00:11:20       Since I knew so much about wine, I was like, you know what, I'm going to take this away from all those assholes. So I started the youtube show and I started comparing the wines to like Hillbilly Jim's like, you know, like boot and like, you know, like racquetballs and like the gum out of a tops pack, all the stuff that actually tastes like and democratized wine. And it was a good thing because wine should not be on a pedestal if you like it. Good. Nobody. There's no cheeseburger expert running around going, Joe, you're using the wrong cheese. It's from the wrong. Right. It's so douchey that nobody wants to get into it. So I was like, fuck that. I'm going to help wine. And it did. It got a lot of young people

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       into it. Yeah. There's a weird pretentiousness to wine that doesn't sort of. It doesn't really exist with a lot of other liquors, like it doesn't exist with Tequila. Well, you're seeing it right? Like craft beer, you're seeing it with Breadski, a craft beers more down home and it's Kinda cool. But you know what Brooklyn heads that are trying to be Douchey as to. Well Brooklyn's a rough spot. It's a weird spot. So confused and thinks it's like North Carolina thinks it's Asheville, North Carolina, like planted in the middle of New York City. It's for what a weird place Brooklyn is right now. And it wasn't like that when I was living in New York at all. Now when I lived in New York, Brooklyn was kind of like rough. It was like Guido's and you know, and uh, urban. It was a, it was a different spot and now it's just all these weird hipsters, skinny jeans and fucking vests on and half.

Speaker 2:          00:12:40       It's probably you listening, love your genes. See what I'm saying? Monday while they're doing it, they can even run on those things that you have to get away with something chasing you guys are getting away from it and not getting away. They just accept their fate and not stealing their role, their pants up, keep it tight. You know, they're, they're paying six x the price of whatever in North Carolina for the same item. Why? Yeah. I don't get that. I don't, don't even get that living together thing. Everyone's smushed into that one spot. It just seems like that's a retro that I love. I live in Manhattan. I liked it. I can't live anywhere else. I definitely could. I call it way, but I really prefer not. Why do you like to be smashed? Him like that. I need speed. I need the action to get to other places like La, like here we are.

Speaker 2:          00:13:23       Right. And like there's nothing going on here at 11:00 PM tonight. Trailer is you just got to go to the city. That's fine. But right out here in Woodland Hills? No, but like yes, fish. Yes. Fish but not Manhattan Ish. No, and not that that's bad by the way. It's probably mainly good for 99 percent. I just know what I'm about. Like I like it. I like, I like the action. You like there being a restaurant open at 1:00 AM, you can get a nice meal at and it's not even that cool. I'm not cool enough for that. Here's what I like. What do you like noise. So for example, what I fucking hate, right? So I love it. So let me give you a good example. I have to sleep with a sound machine because I need the chaos when I walk in my office floor and everybody's got headphones on and there's no sound.

Speaker 2:          00:14:05       I freaked my shit. And like poke somebody in say like blast your spotify or it like I need sound. Really man. I'm the total opposite. I want to be on a mountain. I want to hear birds Chirp and nothing makes me happier than hearing like sirens and people yelling. It really puts me to sleep. Like Lizzie, Lizzie, my sister right now. I know she's listening. She knows there used to be a train outside our house in Edison, New Jersey. I couldn't sleep. The train would come by and it'd be like one of those hips out sound. That's so weird. That's why I love social. That makes sense. You know what I mean? Post that it did a reply like I am an action junkie and luckily I haven't deployed that against drugs or, or a little gambling early on, but I've gotten away from Medicare when enough to get me excited and I can lose and get pissed. So like finally won that game where you're gambling like Vegas, gambling our sports vegas. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:14:59       And like dumb shit, like roulette. Like I would just decide like no, like $500 on the number five because like fuck, if I hit this know just like dumb shit. Like I'm gonna when I go so much for the UFC gamble at all. I've never gambled in Vegas. I've gambled on fights and that's it. I should really bet baseball. I've been a hardcore, like 25 year fantasy baseball player and so you know, a lot. The only time I've ever really made money gambling was when I new up and coming pitchers were coming up and that's how they really run it and that's where I've made my biggest arbitrage. It's hard to make money on fighting too. They used to be able to, when I used to gamble, when I first started working for the UFC, I'd still bet on fights and then I thought about it for a while and it's like, I'm probably not supposed to do this.

Speaker 2:          00:15:43       He's like, it doesn't make any sense. I couldn't. I can't affect anything and no one ever told me I can't do it. It's not like I'm a manager. And that your commentary with slate? Yeah. That. Anyway, they said, they said that it has been me. They said I was biased for people I bet against, which is hilarious. I've had that happen, but I stopped doing that like more than 10 years ago. It was probably like 2002 or three, like right after I first started doing commentary. I quit doing that, but used to be able to make a lot of money because there were some killers and there were and people were undereducated and that's, well there were some killers that would come in from other countries and I would go, you know, like they didn't know about this guy and I'd be like, oh, this like Atlanta.

Speaker 2:          00:16:27       I'm a golf guy, was coming in from, I forget where he's from, but I was like, Jesus Christ, what is the, what's the line? Fucking bet the house, you know, there was some guys from parts unknown. There's a few guys from parts did that so. Well. I was fascinated when they were like from parts unknown shit. Where's he from? Well that's no good for global enterprise at the UFC because you want to engage those people in the other countries. Like, like there's this guy, Habib normal. Go ahead off. Who's the number one contender in the lightweight division? He says fucking murderer. He's such a bad ass. And he's undefeated and like the big thing about this guy's a, he's from Russia. He's from Dagestan. Yup. And there's a, it's a really weird place because it's not a large place, but there's a bunch of killers that come out as one spot and this guy is like the main killer.

Speaker 2:          00:17:11       And so they're, they're planning on doing a big UFC in Russia. This guy's fighting in Russia. It's going to be fucking bonkers, you know? So like, that's a big deal at conor mcgregor in Ireland and you know, there's this, it's a big deal to fight in your country. One hundred percent digital thing has always worked, you know, World Cup Olympics. These are historic things like we're look, nationalism is on the rise. Yeah, no, it definitely is. And, and even, you know, statewide, you know, like a cowboy serone fought this past weekend in Denver, you know, and he's just from Denver. And so when he goes to Denver, they go fucking crazy hometown stuff. There's, there's always that, you know, it's just, it's, it's a fascinating thing. And that your signature on your fucking phone case. That's a little weird there buddy. I'm a weird dude. This is, you know, you got like a watermark signature that's a signature by the way that anybody could rip off.

Speaker 2:          00:17:59       You'll be super careful. Your checkbook. Luckily I don't have any checks. Sometimes I don't even know what a check is. I got a buddy of mine, his name is Guido Orlando. He's a good guy and he, uh, his signature is this, it's like, that's it. Which was great until he got divorced and then his ex wife just fucking went off with the to trench. Just drain the poor guy. Or do I still fucking stuck to his guns though? After she drained them, kept that fucking seconds. He's like, you can take the money, but you hadn't taken this signature taken. My big old bitch gets. Nobody could tell you how you write your name, you know, you could write your name a any way you want. So he just decided that's how I write it. That's it right now. That's a good question. He's a pool cue maker.

Speaker 2:          00:18:43       He makes custom made pool cues. Yeah. And last time I heard he was somewhere in the midwest where pool is still got a pool, is always connected to gambling and it's, it does better in places where there's not as much to do. Right. Not as many options for gambling. Although Manhattan is like a good spot for pool. It is, oddly enough. It's like a date thing, like you know what I mean? Pool pool pool. Like real pool gamblers, high level players. Yeah. I could play, I could play decent. What about darts? No, a dartboard over there. Somebody gave it to me. I never even opened it up over there. Are you good at darts? Yeah. Better than I am. People love darts. Just have good hand eye coordination. It's a fun. It's fun to play. Yeah, but it seems like you're looking at the same thing over and over again.

Speaker 2:          00:19:28       That's my problem with bowling and darts. You're looking at the same goddamn thing. To me. Pattern recognition. It's kind of how I think about like, yeah, content and business and those things. I like pattern recognition. Why do you like pattern recognition? He comes to me but you like chaos. I do. I do. I do. But I. But I, you know, I definitely am a big, big fan of, of pattern recognition. Like to me, everything just happens over and over and over again. You just have to understand the historics. So for example, my great thesis right now where I think all the money's going to be made, this is the television and that is the radio. So you're pointing to your phone. It was the television, the TV, the radio, and it's 19, 48 to 1957, meaning we are going from a primary as a society in the US.

Speaker 2:          00:20:13       The primary device in our lives is switching from the television to the phone. The same thing that happened in the late forties, early fifties from the radio to television. If you go back and understand the brands, the media companies, the personalities, what happened in that decade, then you can start making bets on understanding, Oh wait a minute. If the phones, the television than facebook and twitter and instagram are ABC, NBC and CBS. Shouldn't I become bob hope and seal ball? Because if you go back and read a lot of the radio stars didn't go to television because they disrespected the medium. Huh? So I would tell you, I asked you this before we went on. I was fascinating because I know you've been really a pioneer in this in early dude. Like you went to podcasting and I'm sure now everybody's like, oh my God and can I be on your show?

Speaker 2:          00:21:03       But when you first started, it didn't have the, you know, the brand as a platform. It has now short plenty people were snickering at it or what does it mean? That's what it is. They were doing it reasonably like people are still doing it. Howard stern was making fun of podcast just a couple of years ago, not even a year ago. He was mocking people doing it. Now we get $95, million downloads a month. Of course he's mocking it because everybody mocks the competitive thing that's rise. There's that, there's that. But it's also. Yeah, it is that for sure. Let's just save ourselves in that way. Well, in my opinion, radios fucked because it's it. You have to tune in at a certain time. You have to listen to their commercials. You have to. I mean the. The medium of podcasting is so superior that it's instantaneous. You pause it when you want.

Speaker 2:          00:21:52       You get back into your car, Bluetooth to your car. It plays anywhere. You can go from your car to headphones. It can play in your car or complain your headphones. You could pick it up, you could put it on your laptop, you could have it stream in your house, you do whatever the fuck you want with it. You delete them, you download their. They're instantaneous. You can get them whenever you want. You can go to the archives. I agree. I mean, and it's also a hundred percent uncensored, 100 percent unproduced. There's no one in like with this, it's me and Jamie and that's it. I mean there's no one else involved in this. That's it. And look at Jamie, he's just chilling, but I mean it's really amazing in that respect. There's no corporate end. Like when you get to these kinds of numbers, usually you'd be in some giant building somewhere and there'd be a gang of people involved.

Speaker 2:          00:22:34       They'd have meetings and after the show meetings and a tutorial post and we had. We never had a fucking meeting ever. You guys smoke a little weed. Even talked to each other. Yeah. Look, tell him we're friends, but a little weed will knock some pool balls around. Jamie has a good idea. We're going, yeah, let's do that. And we fucking wind up doing it, but it's so informal and it's like there's nothing going on like corporate. What's amazing is that allows the talent to rise to the top. Well, it, it also allows people to be themselves, which is what allows the talent to rise to the top or allows the. Let me say the word talent, but allows content to find its way in a pure manner where it's not like if you have a bunch of people influencing what you do, as soon as you start compromising and as soon as you start compromising, you just can't.

Speaker 2:          00:23:20       It's never going to get through the right way. Like one of the beautiful things about standup and one of the beautiful things about podcasting is that like if you go to see a guy like bill burr has netflix specials out right now, he's in gentleman just came out, he was on earlier today. Like you see his thoughts. There's no one telling him what to say. There's no one needed to know. When you watch a stand up on stage, that's their thoughts. They figured out a way to hone it to their personality. And then boom, put it out there like that.

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       And that's the same thing with podcasting and that's never existed before. They've never had the opportunity. The Internet is the. We take it for granted. It's really fundamentally only 20 to 21 years old. Windows 95 really kind of put normal people on it is the great shift in our society and I think we haven't fully quantified it's impact across the board. Well if you think about 20 years and how, what a short period of time that is in human history and if we go a hundred years from now and look back, they will look at this like this great explosion of content and creativity and expansion and integration. This integration of thoughts and ideas and the instantaneous ability to communicate that's just never existed before and they're going to think it's slow. Oh yeah. I mean this is going to say everybody's like, it's so fast. And the kids, the kids, I mean I love these kids are not going to be capable to live in society because they're on a phone.

Speaker 1:          00:24:40       I was told that I would not be a functioning human being because I played Zelda and Mike Tyson's punch out too much while they were right. They knew it in that way. I mean, but I tell my friends all the time, like, what world do you think our kids are going to be living in? You think it would be outside throwing a racquet ball against the fucking wall. Like the world shifted. Yeah, there'll be taking selfies of her ass and that's exactly right. So they're doing, they're going to be putting lenses and let me get a vr world 24 slash seven. That's what they're really going to be, is really what they're going to be doing. Yeah. What do you think is next? Like if you look at the cell phone and you look at technology and the integration in our lives, what do you think is the next step?

Speaker 1:          00:25:19       Voice voice is going to be really interesting because it's on us now. So voice. So here let's take a step back. It's all about time arbitrage. The thing that we're all addicted to his time. So Uber, Uber doesn't sell transportation. Uber sells time this whole convenience. That's exactly right. And it's. And it's packaged in time. So voice when Alexa can order your package for you instead of like whatever's faster, like the head of the I pads that we talked about, like the yearbook. Thank you there. Whatever's faster, whatever's faster is what we're going to gravitate towards. So I think voice activation, ai, ar, those kinds of things are really gonna start to populate up over the next half decade. Those, um, those earbuds that you're wearing, do you work out in those things? No. No, they don't hang in there. They'll fall out. I haven't tried it. I don't.

Speaker 1:          00:26:11       I'm not quite sure they look. That's the only thing I would worry about. They look pretty bad ass. I'm upset. It's the best product that was put out since the phone itself. You really believe that. I really believe that. Now. Do they work the way the other way? Is there a button you can press on them to answer the phone? Like how does that work? I don't know. The truth is I'm not even sure, like by the way probably, but I'm so weirded out like I don't do. I'm so bad at that. Like I never get the full value out of products because I don't even have the time to read. That's actually probably good because that means that a product has to be

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       really, really good to impress you because it becomes so easy to use. Have very good insight. Yeah. No, seriously. Yeah. Because there's some shit like on one of those fitbit's like good luck with all that. I'm not getting in there and pulling up apple product. Right. You know what they're gonna do. They're gonna make all that ship. Not work stuff. They're not. They're not here to be friendly. They want your fucking money. Somebody gave me one of these gps watches that you have to charge every other day or some fucking stupid shit. And the other thing that thing charges, like I thought it was like that three days like, you know, like instantaneous. It's been really good. It lasts for three days. Mine have been lasting for as long as three days here. Yeah, I ordered it, but they're not going to deliver it until March.

Speaker 2:          00:27:22       I think they're back ordered for quite a while because too many people like you. Maybe you can predict it up. You fucked it up, dude. Sorry everyone. I like it. I like it. So you think voice meaning like voice control voice and I'm one of the things that I use all the time as a comic is the notes feature on the iphone yet has that little voice thing and it's amazingly accurate and accurate enough that I could realize what I'm saying. Like even if it fucks up a word or something like that, I can go back and look at it. But if you've ever used it. Yeah, I do. It's fucking granted. But I think, I think it's the two point. Oh, of that, right? Where like things are actually happening because of your voice. So we could talk right now and this fucking thing is going to be able to pick up a good 99 percent of everything we're saying and I'm not even touching it.

Speaker 2:          00:28:07       You see it crushed it. I just Uhm, killed it. Perfect. Yup. Got It. One hundred percent. So to me where it gets really exciting is when everything around you is being at. So when everything becomes smart, then it starts getting really interesting. So our phones are smart, right? But what happens when your belt is smart? Oh, and now all of a sudden you go to order a big Mac and you try to pay with your phone, but your belts talking to your phone and when you go to pay it declines and it looks at you and says, order a salad. Fat Ass, Woo. Your belt is telling you it's tightened, correct. Tights pushing against your body. And what about when your refrigerator reorders? Another case of Budweiser because it understands how often you drink it and so you're down to two. It knows that you're going to drink to tonight because that's your average and as soon as you get home that night and open and grabbed the first one, it's already reordering it for you.

Speaker 2:          00:29:01       So your refrigerator becomes an enabler. Everything's going to be. Then they started doing the refrigerator, right? Your traffic, your toothpaste is going to have one drop left. If he orders it for you, so we're going to get into that place where everything is smart and that's when it starts getting a little bit interesting and then. And then virtual reality porn is going to be interesting. Well it's already interesting. Have you ever done the htc vive? You ever fuck with? Yeah. Duncan has the porn and the htc vive and he tried to get me to look at it briefly and they looked at it briefly like six hours. No, a few days. It's not, you're just getting too much. You know, you could just stare at someone's tits. They're just too big. The whole thing is too weird. It's just too. It's not going to be bizarre. You know, it was bizarre 10 years ago.

Speaker 2:          00:29:44       Dating somebody that you met online like bizarre gets redefined real quick. Oh for sure. And guys are real simple. You know, all you need is one of your buddies and five years saying, Bro, no, seriously. That's it. Just that tone. And that was it. Right? And You wonder, you felt where Jamie was like, no bro. Seriously. Well, how many people are getting laid now because of online. It's got to be giant. Like with tinder and swiping all these different things. We missed it. We missed it. That's to say. Yeah, I mean it seems like probably a bit less people are in committed relationships now because it's just a fuck rampage out there in the streets. Yeah. We never recover just a rampage. But a buddy of mine, my friend Greg Fitzsimmons, one of his good friends got divorced and uh, you know, fucking, you know, the whole deal.

Speaker 2:          00:30:32       Torturous marriage hung in there too long. The whole deal. No sex for the last year and a half plus raw, got out and now he's just on a pussy. Catastrophic rampage. I mean there's Dude's just crushing any sad. Right? He's happy, he's happy. He's got a giant smile on his face and his phone's vibrating. It's amazing. Yep. Yeah, I mean sleepiness and it does. You don't even have to be a good looking guy. He's all right. But I mean it's not even that carries water finds its own level so you could find your level. You find what it. Well, that's exactly who is willing to fuck you. They're out there. They're out there always someone. Someone's willing to fuck you 100 percent. True. You just gotta find that person might not be everybody. No, but what's real fun is when you actually break out of your level. Yes. Once in a blue moon every now and then every now and then below your level or above your level. Every now and then the moment you actually talk about the three point line and it's nothing but net. You're like, what? How did that happen?

Speaker 2:          00:31:34       Yeah. Well, you know, it's just, it's fascinating to me because I'm really concerned about the integration of human beings and technology. Not Concerned. I shouldn't say concern, but puzzled as to the end point. The end point is the robots kill us all. You think so? Yeah. Really? Yep. Why do you think that? I think we integrate with them. I think we can come see me until we become bothering forced to them. Yeah, and we don't stop. Well, I think it's those pussies that are scared to integrate that we're going to have to kill off. I think it's folks like you and me, they're going to get the chips so you think we'll be able to survive on team robot. I really killed those humans. I think there's gonna be some, some folks that want to make their own homemade bows and arrows and shit and chop the.

Speaker 2:          00:32:18       Yeah, with a stone ax like those assholes. I don't use matches. I'm fucking robe starts to grow those people, they're going to be a problem. I think people can be scared of it. Like as we continue. I mean people are scared of technology for regeneration of it. I'm real curious how far it gets before we get to 80, 90, a hundred. Like what are we going to really see at the tail end? Right. I mean you think of somebody who's 90 years old now, the shit they saw. Like I mean if you go the whole gamut, like, like in their forties and fifties, they're like a television, you know, like. I mean, so you know. Do you remember? How old are you? Forty nine. Perfect. Your little. I don't know. I don't know how this plays out for you. You might have been a slightly.

Speaker 2:          00:32:57       I'm 41, so it's slightly. It'll be interesting to see what you say. The jumped from fucking Atari to Nintendo. Oh yeah. Santa giant insanity or the iphone from the fucking razor or whatever. So when you have those moments, that's when it gets interesting when you have that quantum product that leaps everything, the ipod from whatever the MP3 fucking horseshit things we had said it's going to be artificial parts too. I think that's going to be a big part of it. Like people who are blind getting them artificial eyes that worked better than realize and then people, you mean initially it's gonna be not as good and then it's going to be as good as you were. 80, 60 slash 50. Now you're 19. Well not even plastic surgery. It's going to be genetic manipulation. I'm saying that the back to pattern recognition when when plastic surgery came out, you are 50 40, you know that range now, 18 year old girl, 16 year old girls are attacking it earlier.

Speaker 2:          00:33:52       So when first it's going to be for the blind and then some dudes going to be like, wait a minute, fuck this, why is my friend who was blind can see shit better than me, I'm going to just do that. And it could go from defense to offense. Somebody showed me a breakdown of Kylie Jenner's plastic surgery over the years and she's only like 20 years old. That's right. And this girl has had her face just chopped apart. She's had her chin widdled down, she's had her hips widen, her breast enhance. She's a little kid. I get it. And she's just there. There's sculpting her with scalpels. Yep. It's very, very, very strange because she doesn't look remotely like she used to look just a couple of years ago. That's right. And I'm thinking heralded for it amongst their peers. And so what do you think's going to happen? People are going to follow that pattern.

Speaker 2:          00:34:41       Oh, for sure. Yeah. I mean they're jumping in head first starts with celebrity than it supposed to. The affluent. Well, the amount of money that it cost to do something like that. It's got to be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars because she's had some really extensive stuff done. I mean, you just didn't see that when we were kids. No, you didn't see a 20 year old girl that hadn't been. Maybe a girl got a boob job. Maybe, but not even. I mean it was so rare for later. You know, maybe in our twenties we heard about such stuff. Wait a minute. One didn't to do that, you know, I get it, but now it's bizarre. Like they're doing stuff to their hips, like girls are getting their hips wide and because asses the offense now I don't. But it's just so strange to see. Like when you look at a person and you know their asses mostly like some weird extra substance that they're sticking in their lap it up.

Speaker 2:          00:35:31       But you know what the guys respond. Like my good friend moves set a long time ago. He said good friend named Moose. Yeah. Robin use. We call them loose. He said about fake boobs. He's like, if they're fake, why can I put them in my mouth? Yeah. If I can touch them, they're real. It was in 1999 albums. Yeah. I think that it's um, it's, it's a fascinating thing because we don't care, but we do care when it gets to lips, you know, there's something about lips were like, hey, hey, hey, slow the fuck up. Like you can get those preposterous tits and nobody blinks. But as soon as you get to lips, gods go Jesus. Like there's something about when they have this crazy. Yep. The lip implant thing. That's a strange one, man. That is a, there's something sad about that one where it elicits a response that you don't get out of the boobs.

Speaker 2:          00:36:19       I get it. Yeah. I could. Dude's nothing. Not a, not a Dick Implant and site. Not a goddamn thing you can do to start happening soon or thing it's going to be genetic. Yeah. And when it happens, I used to have a bit about that. It's going to take about 30 minutes for the first guy to dive and overdose because they go out with a pill that makes your dick bigger. We're not taking one. We're taking them all just going to go give me a stroke. Give me one less than that. Let's fucking do this. Simple that way. Yeah. Well we're going to morph because vaginas are going to have to change to deal with the size of the Dick because dudes are going to have carpet roll Cox. It's just going to be this giant. No, we're not going to stop like people don't understand.

Speaker 2:          00:36:59       Like once we have that ability to get bigger dicks than once, it's going to be like those crazy ladies who bought crushed beer cans with her tits. You ever see them? They get like a triple Z on instagram. It's going to get to that point. It's the spot. Yeah. It's soft porn though. I like how they don't go full twitter. Well that's why I'm glad it's soft porn. But twitter, let's use twitter. You can fuck me. You can do whatever you want on twitter. I kinda liked that. Don't be confused. Instagram can go there too. If what you have to be private is to be a private page. I mean nothing and then they get pulled. Tumbler was really there. Really? Oh yeah, nodding furiously. It investor and Tumbler and the growth was enormous. At one point I'm like, where's all this growth coming from?

Speaker 2:          00:37:42       I'm like, Oh, poor. Oh well what tumbler at one point in time became like really tormented social justice warriors, making bizarre blogs that are very difficult for you to understand. On that note though, it was a very creative space. It was, you say was like, it's gone, it's gone. What happened? Everybody left is it? But it's still active, but no, I like my space. Like a club, like sometimes the clubs, the hottest club in your city still in business six years later, but like it's bridges and tunnels and shit like that. Right, right, right. Yeah. Weird bridges and tunnels that people don't know. What that means is they give you a little doing some recall for powerful Jersey. Yeah. It's um, it's, it's interesting the trends, you know, like why did my space go away like that because the operators weren't good enough. So I'll tell you what's interesting about the trends in social and business digital that people don't understand. Everybody

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       was waiting for facebook to go away. It sucks as a beast. He's an extremely talented all time CEO and so he was good enough if my space was run, first of all, it's sold to newscorp and so once it was owned by the big company you talked about earlier today? No, they wanted to milk it. You know what they did with the first second? They got it. They pump the shit out of their x men movie that they owned into the platform because the economics and the movie were greater than the investment they thought. So they were milking it. Right? It's like somebody buying this and just pumping ungodly amounts of whatever products they thought. Your audience read into the point where they just saturated it. Isn't it weird how something gets a stink on it and then that's kind of it. Like no one wants to come along and try to revamp my space.

Speaker 1:          00:39:23       That's. So. That's another interesting insight. One of the things that I'm dying to know in a 15 year window is will there ever be a recall? Will something die? Will anybody, because I want to buy it to the B, two b space. I want to buy a historic brand, like I want to buy friendster. First of all, I just want. I just want, I just want the Ip, so I think nostalgia plays so the same way. We talk about like saved by the bell and that fucking the sparks and I think that I can buy tumbler in nine years for $40, Aka $11,000,000 and just make enough on tee shirts to the kids when they're 40. They're now 25 that were 15 year olds doing all those weird sites because they're like, yeah, tell him that it was the best. You a good point. Because Jamie and I were looking the other day at all the Netflix shows, like what's most popular?

Speaker 1:          00:40:10       Fuller House is the most popular show. Bringing everything back to him for just coming back, like at 24 is going to be on Netflix now it's going to be a Fox Fox, but it's a different 24, right? Yeah. But I mean like, you know, yes they're. But they're bringing the style. Joe, Joe, my big theory is nostalgia is one of the most under priced assets in the world. So, so my entire thesis in business, so I want to buy the New York jets. Let's take a step back. Yes. Really? Yes. And I'm going to. Oh my God. And I'm so. It's a very good. I'm going to make it happen. So the way I think I'm going to buy the jets and the reason I built my company gonna sell friendster. No, but I'm going to go and buy Mug croupier or animal crackers or cracker jacks or or rainbow pops. I'm going to buy a brand and then market it like it's 20, 20 instead of the Horse Shit TV commercials and fucking billboards and print and all the bullshit that these companies do. Right? And then I'm going to buy it for $130 million, do my thing and then resell it for two point 3 billion by the jets, win super bowls and then I can die. Damn Dude, that's the ultimate goal. That's the plan. Brother. Own the jets. Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:41:20       But you don't. You think that you're the kind of guy that you'll own the jets and go, you know what I'm saying? It's not enough what I need to win super bowls. Right? So I'm going to be like crazy. Like I'm going to make all these crazy owners seem calm. I'm going to be like, I'm going to do shit like I'm going to play. I'm really a 71

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       year old wide receiver. Oh, don't do that. Maybe you couldn't do that once. Genetic engineering kits to the point where they could just to come out with my fucking let's. I'm going to come out with my fucking bionic eyes and let's look and run a four, 3:40 with my new fucking feet. Yeah. Brian made from like duck fucking ass or whatever. You know? Yeah. Like when they integrate a. What was that article about? Their integrating spider silk into a human tissue. They're grading artificial skin for human beings. Were they going to integrate spider silk into human tissue to make it bulletproof? That's fucking Rad. Yeah. Yeah. That's a real thing. I heard the Peter Teal and I want to make sure I'm saying this, but I think till they leave. This is bulletproof skin made from spider silk proteins and human skin cells. By the way, guys, this is all coming.

Speaker 2:          00:42:23       Awesome. Peter Teal, but it might be some other. A mogul and silicon valley is, is putting young blood in himself. It is him. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. So is that going to work? Well, it's kind of like ask him do it. It's bullets based. This is the theory that it's based on. Forget about getting like a log dick. Tell me something that won't let me die and that I will definitely do. Well, not only will not let you die, which is entirely possible. It's going to extend your life, but more importantly, it'll give you more energy while you're alive now, which makes it fascinating because you're going to be able to do the thing. Yeah, fuck you. I'm thinking about doing it tomorrow. I might fly up. What about the spider doing that too? Go ahead ma'am. Shoot, bitch. At the thing is that bullet will destroy your bones.

Speaker 2:          00:43:05       That's so they're going to have to do something with the bone. They're going to have to give you some read Adam and tanium bones underneath, because like the spider silk, nothing gets so jacked in like four minutes. What does he do that 100 percent? One thousand percent. One million percent good. And he also does intermittent fasting, so he drops a lot of body fat. Got It. You know, you get into a state of Ketosis, you don't eat for 14 hours. He pounds like low fat, low carbohydrate, high fat, high contact. So this, his body's burning fat. He's doing tons of steroids. I'm sure. Allegedly. I don't know you. You seem like a nice guy. I'm not shitting on you buddy. I like them. I'm a big fan. I like Hugh Jackman. Yeah, it was fun, but I think he's on steroids. Just sure. Yeah. I'm just telling you I'm an expert in that shit.

Speaker 2:          00:43:53       I can tell. I mean it's very difficult to look the way he looks without doing them. Very, very, very difficult. Excuse me the other day and I'm like, man, he fucking beefs up fast. Yeah, yeah. Well, he does the right shit though, you know what I mean? But that's the thing about like saying someone does steroids, it's not enough like you. It's not like he takes a pill, a conversation that might train. So I started working out three years ago finally taking this serious. I've had two, two trainers full time. They travel with me. I've really gotten into it. I've got my life damaged. How many trainers I've had, I've had, I only have one trainer at a time and they travel with you, but they travel with me. So I was really out of shape, like come never worked out, didn't have a muscle my fucking body three years ago.

Speaker 2:          00:44:33       And I'm like, I'm gonna die. This is stupid and I can afford it. I'm going to hire. I'm not held accountable to myself, but I'm very good at being accountable to others. That's why I run good businesses. I don't want to let the team down. So I figured it out. I fucking found the binary switch. So I hired somebody and they travel with me. Well that's so days. That's an awesome idea because it will force you to work out. Both of them are. No, not with them. The first guy, Mike is like, like it was interesting. He wasn't saying do steroids, but it was interesting to hear a perspective of like, peep. I've been fascinated by the steroid conversation in general. Like I think certain things become taboo and then they don't like marijuana. Right? Is Steroids that I'm asking you because I feel like you're closer to that genre than I am.

Speaker 2:          00:45:16       Well, they most certainly work 100 percent. So let's go. Let's go over that first. Let's take it from step by step. Here's what's important. It's very important that young people don't do them and this is why because you ruined your endocrine system. It's very important that young people realize that if you do get an 18 now even into your twenties, when you do steroids and you're a young person and you have a healthy endocrine system, what happens is you inject exogenous steroids or exotic testosterone into your system. It shuts down your natural production of testosterone and then you're fucked because then when you get off the steroids, your body doesn't work right. Your testicles aren't functioning correctly and it takes you roughly depending on the person and depending on how you treat it, like what, what treatments you use to kickstart your endocrine system. Again, half the time you want to steroids to recover.

Speaker 2:          00:46:07       So if you did a two month cycle for one month, you're going to be miserable and your Dick's not going to work. Got It. So it's very important for young people. However, once you get older, like I'm 49 and it becomes sort of that. That's why people do it, put him in. Well because it's a self esteem enabler, right? For a guy. And if I'm a guy right now and I feel like I need the muscles for the summertime, he's like, I'm going to go on a cycle for two months. I'll have a shitty fucking ma may or April and that will be ready to roll. Yes. No, you know, you should get your blood work monitored. Like if you're really considering doing something. I think the most important thing is to do very little to do just a small amount and give yourself a little boost.

Speaker 2:          00:46:51       You don't want to go fucking hog wild and take some Androgel 50 and turn into a fucking gorilla. You don't want to do that because it's too much of a shock to your system. However, when you're in your forties like you are, then testosterone replacement therapy becomes a very viable alternative because your body is just simply not producing testosterone correctly. However, can we use gorilla because I just got excited. You could. You could kind of. You could still take some time, but here's the thing, like the Hugh Jackman thing, because when I get back to that, that motherfucker works hard. There is no way you look like that unless you work hard, so you have to do like really, really, really hard. You got to do fucking heavy dead lifts, heavy squats. You've got to shock your system. You're got to get your body to think, Holy Shit.

Speaker 2:          00:47:34       This crazy asshole wants to carry around gigantic amounts of weight. We're fighting against gravity. We have to incorporate all of our resources. Your body does not want to use resources to get bigger. It just doesn't. It resists it because it's not. It's not healthy and it's not a smart survival tactic like for your body to put on all this meat. Then all that meet needs fuel, like your body's not totally convinced you're going to have this fuel because for thousands and thousands of years, food was very, very difficult to come by. So for your body to be convinced that you're doing this all the time, we need this extra mass like you have to have massive amounts of food and massive amounts of work that's hugely important. And then steroids, those things too, but more important than steroids is balancing your diet out, making sure your nutrient levels are all consistent.

Speaker 2:          00:48:21       They're all healthy, that you have the proper amount of vitamin B, Vitamin D, All these different essential nutrients, essential fatty acids, all the proper amino acids, like a steroid is just a bandaid on an account a least five days a week, at least five days a week. Zero. Jamie runs a lot. He's a fucking stud. But um, you know, I do a lot of different shit. I love Jamie's. He's a fucking runner. You how many miles you run a lot of miles right now. I told you, I'm like, I'm doing weight lifting and I just get back into basketball, shooting hoops this weekend. When you were at your peak of running, you running some pretty impressive numbers of miles a week. Easily. Yeah, that's back to basketball. I just put up a post so I didn't let my brother Aja score on me and he's 11 years younger than me until he was like 15 score score. You wouldn't let them know.

Speaker 2:          00:49:14       I'm a. So I'm my four year old guy. He's got, he's got a Zander, my little guy, he's got a weird condition when he picks up the basketball he starts kind of weirdly crying cause he knows dad's going to come out of somewhere and block the fucking shit out of him. And so I posted this thing about it today on instagram and it was funny to watch everybody. I mean everybody's in these fucking eighth place trophies. I'm going to kill people like all this fucking infrastructure of fake fucking self esteem and then these kids go into the market and they get punched in the mouth and they don't know what to do. So you don't let your kids score and you either know. That's hilarious. I will not let I'm, I'm, I'm fucking gonna. Beat the like until he could win, then he's good. Like age.

Speaker 2:          00:49:53       My brother has a better basketball player than me because I didn't let him. Like, what? What are you going to let people score for? That's a very interesting perspective. Let me give you mine, please. I don't. Um, I don't think you should ever be very competitive with people who are not competitive with you. So here's a perfect example. An interesting thing. When I do Jujitsu, I'm a black belt in Jujitsu, Jujitsu with a white belt. I treat them very kindly. I, I might tap them out a little bit, but I, there's no way I roll with them the way I roll with another black belt. Well, that's fighting in that there's a difference. It's not a statement. It's a game. The game respect. So what like when, like if I'm rolling with someone and they're making mistakes, I'll correct their mistakes if I want it to.

Speaker 2:          00:50:37       If I'm wrong with someone who's a white belt, I could just cut right through them, just keep cutting right through them. But you know what you do with them, you discourage people from doing it and it's not really fair because you're not getting anything out of it either. All you're getting out of you're practicing like a grappling dummy and like occasionally maybe that's a good thing to do. I feel like once you get into the blue belt and purple belt range, then I'm going to go with you 100 percent because when you're dealing with someone who's not really competitive with you, it doesn't make sense. You're not getting anything out of it really. You know? I think. I think it's an interesting perspective. So what you really lovely like kids kick the shit out of me. I have an eight. Anyone martial arts? I have an eight year old and she's.

Speaker 2:          00:51:20       She's allowed to punch me and kick me full blast. She doesn't kick the shit out of me. Yeah. Of course, but she's 50 pounds, but she leg kicks me full blast. I mean I don't ever hit her back. She, she sets up leg kicks, she throws a left hook to the body and then she comes around with that right leg kick. WHAP whap. And as long you mean she's allowed to hit me full blast. So like she'll, she'll go, can I hit you on? All right, go ahead and she'll just tee off on me. So it gets her used to doing it now if I like. Every time she went to do that, I checked it and it hurt her shin or punched her in the face. Well then she's going to have this mental block in her head that she's not gonna be able to overcome one day she's going to get to be, get to a point where I can light spar with her.

Speaker 2:          00:52:01       She's not there. Yeah, I do think maybe she'll get there some certain games play out differently. Right? I mean fun. Like I'm not letting my seven year old daughter score basket either. Right. But I probably wouldn't punch her in the face. Right, right, right, right. I'm not letting her beat me in. No, you're not even letting her know. That's fun. I won't like snap her neck or rip your throat out like yes. Well what I do is like say like, here's another example, like if I'm rolling with a girl, you know, if you're a man is doing Jujitsu with a girl. Yeah. If you're going full blast, you're not getting anything out of it either. So what I do is if I'm sparring with a girl, I pretend that I'm only as strong as them, so if they're pushing against me instead of going the fuck out of here and just locking down and you know, and giving them the full chimpanzee strength I give, I give with things.

Speaker 2:          00:52:47       So I don't, I don't want to allow my body to use full blast. I understand. So as they push I just give in and try to use technique and find a better way in, you know, I just try it out, we'll try to go with it, you know? Yeah. So yeah, I let them score on me in that sense. Like I'll let them get side control on me. And then I'll hit escape and try to get back in, but everything I do, I do with almost no strength. I just move my own body away. I would tap them out in four seconds. I just don't know any. I understand. Probably wouldn't by the way, just because 99 percent of you don't know me. I wouldn't have done it at all. I would've never even got in there. I don't know that thing. But if you did know that thing, I think maybe you'd probably have a different opinion on it.

Speaker 2:          00:53:29       Correct. What I mean by that thing is if I like, I'm either going to go in there and not let the guy score or what would have mostly likely happened is I wouldn't go in the ring. Whatever that ring is at all in the first place. I'm not trying to discourage. No, I know what you're playing. Like. Yeah. I just think that when you're playing basketball and you're playing basketball with a small person, that doesn't move as good as you. You're trying to blow them out of just knocking them by slamming, slamming shit. Put it if I can. But if I can win 11 nothing and remind them for the rest of their lives, I'm interested in that. So fine.

Speaker 2:          00:54:08       I don't know what else to say. I understand what you're saying. Dick. Did the competition. It's fun. I enjoy it. I'm not trying to hurt me. Like I think there's two ways to build the biggest building. One, just build the biggest building or to tear everybody else's. Building down. No interest in hearing other people's buildings. But if I fucking build the biggest building I'm letting you know. And the same way that you should let me know I'm not gonna cry about that, but I love the game. That's why I love business. It's the one place you can do that forever. I agree with you, but I just feel like physical things that becomes a very to a different place. I'm not in rings and that gets into it. Again, in basketball, like you run faster, you'll feel very comfortable shutting out my seven year old daughter and basketball, but I'm completely not comfortable punching so you know.

Speaker 2:          00:54:54       I see what you're saying. Yeah. Let's let her score, man. Let her let her sneak through a little bit. Do you think the paper view of Mcgregor Mayweather? It's going to be because it's not just not a debate anymore. Hundred percent going to happen. I don't know about that 100 percent gonna happen. No. Putting it on tape right now might not be right. Well, listen. Well, you know what? Either build the biggest building or not when I will have a nice little exchange in 40 years. You will. You'll make fun of me. You'll know you're close as clip. It's happening. Well, I would say doing everything they can. If you looked at it as in terms of a zero percent chance to 100 percent number, I think we're in the seventies in the seventies or eighties, clarify because I think that's where Brad as well. I think there's a significant legal hurdle to overcome with the UFC and they might not.

Speaker 2:          00:55:35       Might not overcome that depending on how they play that card. This is my opinion on it. Now. Mcgregor has publicly stated that he believes because of the Ali Act, he can compete in boxing and not do it with the UFC, but he wants everything to be smooth so he would rather have the UFC involved, but he also wants the UFC to recognize what he says is their place, so there's mayweather productions, the UFC and mcgregor productions, so this is what he's promotions rather, so this is what he is stating now he's going to be a partner in the promotion and so there's going to be some sort of a negotiation for how things are split up in three ways and then the question becomes can can they work that out? Okay. If they can work that out, then it becomes a question of should they do it and will it be competitive and is it good for their brand and that's where they might have a debate on this.

Speaker 2:          00:56:26       I think what's gonna end up happening is the economics are going to be so big that it's going to override the brand play. The the math is just going to be too big. It's possible, but mcgregor so big. The economics of him fighting and MMA like see, look at it this way. So if he fights mayweather, maybe there'll be 4 million pay per view buys. Right. But it was packed. What was Pacquiao mayweather before? What was it, Jamie? Four and a half or something. We looked at it the other day. Just Google it. Google it real quick. I think it was like four and a half. I think it was the biggest of all. Four point six, right? Was it a four point six? I think was the biggest of all. Well, we'll find out. I think it was the biggest of all time. And uh, I think that, that those numbers though, here's the deal.

Speaker 2:          00:57:05       Mcgregor can do those numbers over the course of three fights. So is that a 44 point six? So four point 6 million papers using now mcgregor has done one point five for the Nate Diaz rematch. One point three for Eddie Alvarez. Some. Somewhere around those range. So that right there, just those two together. A roughly $3 million pay per views for to fight. He making notes. Fights. Fuck load. No, no, he's not going to make the kind of, I mean not as not the same money he would make as a co promoter, but, and, and if he loses in a bat in a boxing match, it's so simple for him to say, that's not what I do and go back. That's true. I don't know. MMA, the not even remotely close to you and not enough to be dangerous here, but what, from what I understand, I've done a little homework.

Speaker 2:          00:57:49       He doesn't have a lot of great natural fights. He's a third fight with Diaz. Great natural fights. These next three fights, he's got a bunch. So help me understand what like, you know, that's why I'm setting it up for you. So from a financial standpoint, from what the fans want, right? The champions underneath of it seems like he's fought several of them. He's one those pretty glaringly. Cool. What's the boy when the Nate Diaz fight glaring? The first one on the second one was a very close decision. I mean the other new ideas is the big one is the big one. So that one brings in close to 2 million pay per view buys. I really do. I grieve ds three, one point three and one point two, one point five, one point five and one point three, three for Eddie Alvarez where he won his second world title, right?

Speaker 2:          00:58:31       The other one is tyron woodley or whoever wins the tyron woodley versus Stephen Wonderboy Thompson rematch for 170 pound title. That's an interesting fight too, because if it goes up and and challenges at one 70 and winds that Jesus fucking Christ, now he's through the roof. Now he's the biggest star in sports. I mean he becomes this gigantic, huge global worldwide phenomenon that's, that's entirely inside the realm of possibility. Now he's not favored in a fight. He gets 170 pound champion because the guys are bigger, they're faster or they're, they're, they're stronger rather. But he's fast as fuck. He's really clever. He's very interesting. The way he approached his fights, he's, he's very intelligent and it's not outside the realm of possibility that he could beat someone at 170 pounds that's holding the world title, whoever that is. So that's a big fight too, and that could also with him attached to bring in one point five, maybe 2 million pay per view buys.

Speaker 2:          00:59:27       So what you're talking about is in a couple of fights he could make what he could make in that one. Floyd mayweather fight. He wants to be a global icon. There's no way. Anything he does in just MMA trumps that fight. No, no, you're right. You're right. Because it's a short sentence. It transcends the sport also. It's a really good match for him because mayweather doesn't really knock people out. I mean he knocked out Victor Ortiz, Ortiz had his hands down. Exactly. He fucked up. He headbutted him and then he was trying to apologize and then may whether the chaotic. But that was a different sort of scenario. Before that. The last guy, I believe he stopped as Ricky Hatton and he stumped. Yeah, 11 or 12. I mean he's in. But by the way, Ricky Hatton is like half the size of conor mcgregor. Conor mcgregor is a big guy.

Speaker 2:          01:00:13       He's tall. He's five, nine. He's broad shouldered and he fights. He can fight easily at one 70, you know, he cuts weight down to 1:55. I'm in a fairly healthy manner. Very unhealthy for him to get down to 1:45, but he has done it. If they fight, I assume they're going to fight somewhere in 155 pound range. Connor will be significantly bigger than anybody floyd's ever fought before. What was your favorite sport growing up? Martial arts growing up? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I was just like, why? It shouldn't definitely that Chuck Norris Movies got me into it times for sure. Yeah, there was that, but there was also the finality of it and also finish him. Yeah. Well it was just, it was so real. Like it didn't matter to me anymore. Have a ball. I love that. The hat, obviously a mortal Kombat the guy right next to the guy had the hat, like sliced you with the hat.

Speaker 2:          01:01:09       Random. Someone's slice to mortal Kombat three years. Uh, it just, to me it was so much more dangerous. It was so much more. There's so much more on the line. Or you'll fight fan like a boxing fan too. I've always described martial arts as high level problem solving with dire physical consequences. That's what I looked at it. Yeah. It's just, it's also your problem solving. Someone who's improvising in the moment with like. And there's such a psychological factor in why you like stand up to. Yeah. It's how I think about keynotes. So what. One of the reasons I think my speaking career has gone so well is I'm reverse engineering the crowd in realtime. How so? I'm literally give them the talk, right? Feeding off the reactions and navigating in an Improv manner on my business content. Huh? So you don't have a clear outline. I have a clear outline for the first seven minutes, which is I already gave you that spiel. I like to frame up my life. I'm an immigrant, made that little Schpeel I already gave you. That's all I've got. And then I basically go into the state of the union. Okay. So now if you're going to give a speech. So if you're going to give

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       one of these keynotes, what's your objective? Like what are you trying to accomplish? What are you doing that leg brand legacy, legacy. I, so I talk about stuff that most people think is coming and I think it's actually here and they don't think it's real anything. I'm a futurist or a or a destructor and so I'll go and talk about instagram and why I think people can go from zero to $100 million in their business in seven years or from zero to $100,000. So the amount of people listening right now that are making $81,000 a year doing something they hate that could make $80,000 a year on instagram either selling something or slowly but surely building their brand and then doing content deals is staggeringly practical. How do people make money on instagram? I don't make any money. I have one point 8 million instagram followers have made zero sense.

Speaker 1:          01:03:11       The way people make money, the way people make money is always the same. So I would argue you do make money because you're using a chest move instead of transacting just on that platform. That is a platform where you create reach and awareness that drives towards things of this nature and then you either sell advertising or get into business development where you have pieces of equity in businesses that you build through the attention people sell against the tension. So either you're doing commercials or you're doing step two, which is you're building brand, right? So one thing I've never done is I've never been paid ever for a piece of content I put out on social, which is the majority of how people get paid, but I get paid $100,000 to give a speech and I've done that because of the attention and awareness that I've been able to build on those platforms.

Speaker 1:          01:03:58       Every book, Mr. Speeches, speeches, fuck this. Fuck all this posts and pictures of my food. So do I think. I think. I think there's, you know, you could sell stuff right now I'm obsessed with people buying and selling shit. I don't know if you know this, but it is scary. Scary how much money can be made if you go to thrift stores and Marshall's and dollar stores and garage sales. And Flip Shit on craigslist. Ebay let go. Really? And I mean real economics. So people go to thrift stores, they buy a bunch of vintage clothes and then they go on craigslist. It's even scarier than that. Now that you have a phone and you get the Ebay App and you just scan shit. It's not even vintage clothes. Which is like the thing that most people listening think makes sense. It's fucking every single thing on earth.

Speaker 1:          01:04:48       Every single person right now that's listening, that's needs $5,000. It's in your fucking house. It's in your closet, it's in your basement, it's in your attic. Your shit that you're not using is worth money and you just don't want to put in the work. The flip it, Huh? Uh Huh. So I started something called the 2017 flip challenge, right? And I made this video and the amount of. I'm getting hundreds of emails a week of people like, Holy Shit. I was on fucking welfare. I have college loans. I wanted to take my family on a vacation. And it was the fucking fourth pair of shoes in my closet that I didn't have. Or people that are not as fortunate maybe really don't have a lot of stuff in their home. They were just going to dollar stores or thrift store scanning with the Ebay APP. One guy found some guy just bought like 80,000 fucking American apparel tee shirts for $80, forty nine cents. And it's like selling them for like 16 bucks on Ebay. Like it's the flip man. I'm telling you, the reason I'm saying this right now is I want somebody to leave with something tangible from us. They're paying for themselves. The flip, like all this fucking shit here. Like I'm looking. Yeah, I'm looking at him like that. Big things. Probably 11 and this fucking Buddha. So for 11 bucks, you think that's worth way more than that respect, you know. But like,

Speaker 2:          01:06:01       you know what the plan is to sell that guy, makes those. He actually sculpt them and then makes a mold of the sculpture and then sends them out. They're dope. And the sunglasses actually come off. A biggie. His eyes, his details in his eyes, smoking dope, and then we've got a condom. Mcgregor one here and the Tupac. One couple of bliss. Plastisol guy's a bad motherfucker.

Speaker 1:          01:06:21       So Joe on this thing. Seriously, it's. I'm fascinated by this. By what? This weapon flipping shit. Yeah. I'm fat because you understand because of the content I put out, I get asked a thousand times a week through social email live streams. How do I start? I need money. How do I raise money from venture capitalists? I'm like, you don't. You're not raising money from venture capitalist lets you know you're not fucking like at 98 point nine percent of the people are not raising money from venture capitalists. Invest. You're not inventing the next instagram. Let's get a lot more fucking practical and like start like learning how to actually make money and then take that money and if you want to go build an APP, would that money Mazal Tov. But learn how to actually make the money. And the flip thing has been, I'd be putting out business content for a long time. It's been the one thing that I'm watching people actually pull off.

Speaker 2:          01:07:14       Hm. That's a really interesting perspective because you're talking about something that's very practical, like somebody can actually get going on that books. You know, like when someone comes to you and says, I want to start the new facebook, you're like, well good luck. Yeah, that's been, you know this. They just think immediately they're going to be able to start to see match come up and you're like, Hey, I'm starting this business. It's going to be like it's gonna be for UFC fighters if they want. If you. Yeah, you get pitched $25 and invest in businesses. I fucking believe in let alone ones that you don't exactly like. I've had people come up to me that have like super solid businesses that are really. I think what they're doing is awesome. Have you ever passed anything that's gone on to be like monster? What? Oh, I'm not interested.

Speaker 2:          01:07:56       I don't. I'm not. I'm just not interested. To me. I mean obviously I have a very different life than you do in terms of like that is what you do. You're about. Because I'm not, that's not what I do, so for me, anything that takes away from my time is that thinking. Yeah. Normally, like people say, well you don't want to, you want to have to do anything. You just invest it like, no, you don't. No, you don't understand because then I'm gonna think about it and that's very valuable. My thoughts and having that resource occupied by anything that in is you are doing something, they're leveraging your name and now you're associated with it and you've got and you care about your name. Yeah. And like there's definitely that. I mean that's what you mean. Even if my name wasn't associated with it, if it was just they were just using my money, I just, I don't want to think like I have a limit. Yeah. Well I have too much shit I'm already thinking about. It's not less thinking. My thinking is over. Yeah, exactly. I avoid anything new just simply because I get obsessed with things. I don't have the time I get it. Yeah. What's the last thing you got obsessed with? Archery. Archery. Bowhunting? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:09:05       Oh yeah. Have you been doing. Trust me, five years, 45 years, and continue to get worse with less than five years. Four and a half years hunting, three years. Bowhunting. What are you obsessed with you pussy. Basketball. He loved me. Like honestly, I've been for the last little bit last year. It's honestly what you like, what you talk about, but not. I haven't been following you for the last year. I've been following you since you run diggnation a long time. Oh yeah. By the way, Jamie's the first person to tell me about. You initially talked to you about about him too. Like twice and then I got an email from your guy like serendipitous asleep, but a content and different things. Pattern recognition to. I'm just trying to figure out all this stuff almost because I was five, 10 years ago. I wanted to be Zuckerberg, instagram, all of that stuff and I know now it's not there.

Speaker 2:          01:09:51       I'm doing a different job and you know what's interesting about that? The thing that has really come to the top and my content that's really also helping people. Self awareness. One thing I'm enjoying listening to you, I'm like, I'm like, this guy really like you can just like a martial art. It's been really interesting. I'm sitting here kind of thinking. I'm like, wow, there's some real self awareness going on here and even just thinking about you now saying that I wish I could figure out, forget about drug to make your Dick Bigger. If I could give somebody a pill that would allow them to deploy self awareness, the amount of happiness that would be going on in this world would be tremendous. I I understand that. I can give them a solution struggle and overcoming obstacles and very difficult problems to solve problem solving, whether it's through martial arts or even through complicated things that don't seem complicated like yoga, very difficult tasks teach you about yourself.

Speaker 2:          01:10:43       Those things teach you about personal awareness. Let's let's take a step back amount of people that when they do that and fail, right, decide to spend all their fucking time on pondering and blaming is unbelievably high. Well, that's just a problem with the way their mind is structured. Let's just consciousness structuring. Hence why I'm interested in that self awareness pill and slash or populating this conversation to the top because when you start caring about what you are versus what you're not good shit happens. Right? Well, yeah, exactly. Or you know, I assume when I think about Larry Holmes, like I had a conversation once about like how the Jab that he was deceased in assassin. Man, it's really interesting when you start tripling down in your strengths, obviously you have to round yourself out. You don't want to get exposed, especially in mma. Obviously it's so multidimensional that way, um, that it becomes a vulnerability.

Speaker 2:          01:11:39       But fuck man, I'm big on tripling down on people's strengths. Yeah, it's huge. Well, the, one of the interesting things about mma is people that you call specialists, like there's a few people that are really good at one aspect of MMA and they dominate people because of that. Like Anderson Silva is the greatest martial artist of all time was just a sensational striker. And when you, every fight starts off standing. You had to deal with his striking before you could get to him before you could take him down, before he could try to submit him through that. He had to get through that and that was a. he's a specialist. Damien Maia is a specialist in a completely different ways. One of the top welterweight contenders, probably number one now next to a wonderboy was going to be fighting for a rematch, the title, but Damien Maia is a pure Jujitsu specialists.

Speaker 2:          01:12:23       His striking is only to get close enough to you to grab you dragged to the ground, strangle you, and in that way he's a lot of a lot of what he is as a throwback, but his jujitsu skill is so elite that everyone else who goes to the ground with him. Even guys like Carlos Condit who was a former world champion to really high level guy, just get smushed like a bug and strangled because he's such a specialist. I get it. Yeah, it's martial arts is very interesting in that way because that works with some people, but it doesn't work with other people and other people have beaten. Damien Maia, because of the fact that in many ways one dimensional, but that one dimension is a motherfucker of a dementia. I'm. I'm a big boxing fan. I grew up a big Aaron Pryor family to a big pernell whitaker fan.

Speaker 2:          01:13:08       Like what was in that bottle? Man? Louis, what the fuck did he slip them? What did he slip them? I'm dying to know. I would like to know Panama Lewis is still alive. I'm able to. I'm able to quantify that because I think about a lot of the boxers who had their one or two things. Then it was just fascinating. Sure. Like had to figure it out. Sure. Jones Rojo. You know, it's funny you're talking about Condo, like when Roy Jones found his moment to go up to heavyweight. Interesting. Okay. Well, here's a perfect example. We were talking about steroids. Yes. When Roy Jones went up to fight John Ruiz, I don't know. Roy Dot well. I've met him. He's a great guy. I'm a huge fan. He's probably one of my favorite boxers, if not my favorite of all. Time was great, but I'm pretty sure he did some Mexican supplements to fight John Ruiz to get up to that way.

Speaker 2:          01:13:47       He was 200 pounds. He was jacked. He was shredded. It's not necessarily that natural for you to put on that kind of weight in that short period of one slash 68 to one slash 75 to 200. That's a big. That's a lot of CIG jumping and looked amazing and you know, kept a speed. Then here's the thing, dropped back down to one 75 again to fight tarver and looked like shit. Yeah. Had a really hard time making the way and I think also you look at his body who was smooth, his muscle tone was different. It didn't look the same and I think a lot of that is endocrine system potentially suffering from the steroids, like taking steroids and then the crash, I don't know, this is pure speculation, but all my years of seeing people do the same thing, seeing people take steroids or take anything that any anabolic enhancements and then dropping down and getting off of them.

Speaker 2:          01:14:36       Again, you just, you've seen flat pattern recognition. Well, I know a lot of pattern recognition about fighting. I, that's one of the things about fighting is pattern chunking. You know, you see things that you've seen before, you know, and you, you see it coming before maybe even the other guy sees it coming and that's what I do with consumer behavior and that's how I bet on business. That makes sense. I was an early investor in facebook and Tumblr and twitter. It was because I just knew that that looked to me like email. That looked to me like I saw that I invested in twitter because I thought it was the next email. What do you think of snapchat? So I invest at a first full, full disclosure. I wrote a $5,000,000 check into snapchat, snapchat, snapchat. That you're responsible for those puppy dog filters. That shit's got to stop.

Speaker 2:          01:15:19       But ladies, listen to me. Stop taking pictures with the puppy dog nose stop. I like it. I think more the don't. Don't listen to me. I'm just fucking around. Do whatever you want to do. The flowers on the head though aren't making it look any better yet is it gives you a coachella. It's fake. They're fake flowers or think you're crazy person. They do that or should they put the check? No, they should definitely take flowers to figure out the next move because instagram's features have in the short term affected it and where snapchat was on the verge of becoming a monster was we started seeing 40 and 50 year olds download it. The features came to instagram. It gave those 45 year olds a reason not to download another APP and that's why snapchat's lost a little momentum. It's not that a 20 year old.

Speaker 2:          01:16:06       Yes. Some are using stories more than instagram now. It wasn't like a mass exodus of that. It was the growth that they were feeling. Forty and 50 year olds that were just starting just like facebook back in 2000, 10, 11. They just started getting your aunt that wanted to act like she was in it starting to download and then the network effect because her aunt has a friend and that's what happens. It stopped that and that is the concern that snapchat has, which is in wants to be at full scale because that's how you justify a $20,000,000,000 valuation, which is what it wants to go IPO at. I think snapchat's big things. The filters like the Zombie filter in the rainbow throw up all that stuff. Like that's what makes it cool and the fact that I could take your face and put her on my face, like that's kind of dope. I mean a lot of people do that and it's really pretty amazing. If your face is similar, like similar sized, what you can pull off. It's amazing. I agree. I mean, listen, they've done a lot of smart stuff, especially with ar and all that kind of stuff. It's gonna be very fascinating. If the glasses take off at full

Speaker 1:          01:17:09       scale or what else are they up to? They call themselves snap now. I've never seen a snapchat anymore as a company. Their snapchat, but as a holding company, corporate bullshit. Nobody cares about. The reason I care is when they came out with the glasses speckles I, I've never seen a social network act like a fashion brand. There's something different about snapchat that way. How's it act like a fashion brand? Because the glass is like if you said if I woke up tomorrow and found out that snapchat was coming out with sneakers, I'd be like [inaudible], where's. That would make no sense for twitter or instagram or facebook. Huh? So that's where I'm curious if they're opening up that avenue. Snap is very la out. It is not hardcore silicon valley product. It's got a little that La Flavor. Evan's got that. What's the difference? The difference is Silicon Valley is very tech nerded out.

Speaker 1:          01:18:00       It's a little different now because everybody's gone there to make their millions, but it is still very grounded in technology. Engineers are the rock stars and it's a San Francisco vibe. Snapchat is an La company and it started by a very young entrepreneur who is way cooler than the majority of entrepreneurs that we've seen before. Build these products just in life. He was a cooler kid and the vibe of the product that the exclusiveness of it, the awkwardness abusing it and they like that. It's like, if you don't understand us, fuck you. It had that vibe and so I'm curious to see how that plays out. Yeah. I don't use it. I have it on my phone. I use instagram and twitter and facebook and facebook. Honestly, I kind of use facebook only because instagram links up to it. I don't, but it's interesting like distribution. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:18:48       Yeah. I'd use it and I don't interact with people that much on facebook and people get mad, but this don't have that much time. That is native to interact there. Right. It's a lot easier to interact in an on a twitter. Twitter's easiest. Fuck. Instagram's a little weirder because like when you get a comment, if you reply to that comment, then you have to go find the original comment. It's not a native. It's clunkier. Twitter is the watercooler of our society. It's got a lot of shortcomings for content and how much people are paying attention to the newsfeed, but definitely from a conversation standpoint there's nothing close. So for example, when this airs, like that's where I'll go and engage with people because a lot of people have never heard of me before that, listen to this and I'll respond to those feedbacks much more data than anyone else.

Speaker 1:          01:19:30       Yeah, I will too. And that's where I have the most followers too and I will interact with people more, but I also feel like I said, I just think that Jamie was just telling me the other day that a instagram makes it so you can like people's comments now. Yes. That's a new little feature. They've, they've been, as you know, Jim, it sounds like you're really getting deeper and deeper in this game. Like they've been innovating very fast. Tons, tons. Snapchat today put out a way for you to link out to websites. So there's just movement. There's always moving. Facebook is definitely gonna launch stories in facebook. Yeah, because yeah, they just launched it in Ireland, so I've already seen the preview of it. It's out like it, so that's coming, so that will be interesting to see what that does. So plenty more to come.

Speaker 1:          01:20:10       I think facebook should become a television company like I think they should actually come out with a television and then I think when you're in an actual towe have an actual physical television. This is just what I think they should do. And when you're in your feed you see something, you just flick it and it goes on your television, you watch it. So like apple TV does. Hmm. Don't do that. Facebook, facebook, listen to me. If you want to talk about fighting somebody. Facebook, if you want to fight for job, no one's going to buy your fucking TV. You're got to make a lot of TVS. They're going to be sitting in a warehouse somewhere. Can we? The mistake I made that mistake, the TV I'm going to say, and in this keynote, look at this great clip from 2017 when I fully predicted the facebook TV.

Speaker 1:          01:20:55       I just. Why would they get involved in selling tvs? What would it be different than their TV? And you own the hardware, you own the action. Why would anybody buy that when you could do like a little google chrome thing that sticks right into a Usb port and just shoot it right from your android phone and TV and make the best product. Everybody has permission to play in anybody space. So if you make the best tv, Sony had no permission to go in the video game space until they made the fucking playstation. Everybody's like, what the fuck? Right? Like Netflix wasn't supposed to produce the best original content, but that's a difference, right? Like there's a platform, if you're selling a console that makes video games, then you have to hire a bunch of people to make games for that. Or you're the razor and the razor blade thing, right?

Speaker 1:          01:21:40       Like facebook and just first of all, razor and razor blade. Would it be. And you just become the platform. Other people can make it like Sony, Sony to make those games. Right. But they hired people to. They made some of their own game and mainly bought from other professors, but more importantly they created a platform that people built for that facebook has facebook can go out and buy the number for TB manufacturer steel to people from Samsung and they're in the fucking game. Right. But everybody already has a TV like getting them to buy a facebook tv one more time and you know this Joe, like we used to have Sony Tvs. Now we have Samsung. People like Jamie, you with me on this now he's with me with both of you. I mean, I see what you're both saying. Both of you. You know, I'm leaving Jamie, Jamie, Jamie.

Speaker 1:          01:22:20       This is historic. He also knows that I'm not connected directly. Correct. Yeah, that's a great point because I. I mean you brought up that snapchat sneaker thing a few weeks ago. At least. That's what I saw with a few weeks ago and I think that's a great point. It's not gonna work for everyone. Good idea if you want to go broke, but it's a, it's a brand thing like put all your money and you know what's interesting is actually where I was about to go. You just walked into it. I'm fascinated by the following, the fact that you even said easy's three years ago, right? Everybody, you would have never said anything to understand us. The reason why I say because he buys easiest and mock him on a daily basis, but what are the shittiest fucking goofy look at sneakers I've ever seen in my life and and they sell it crazy.

Speaker 1:          01:23:01       God, there's a lot of retards out there. Hey Joe, how about this? What I'm of the age then when, when you have ceased started when mixed martial arts started hitting the scene, right? Royce Gracie, like way back. It feels like. So I apologize. So you know, what did everybody say about that? No chance. Fucking stupid. Well, that's different. No, it's not sure. It is at the. Everybody understood that fighting at the fashion is primal. It's the way we express. These are definitely not private. Brother yeezys are primal. That's stupid. Stripe and color. Stripe on the side of Christ makes them harder to duplicate. They look like shit wrong. Trust me. Five years from now, you're gonna making fun of those things.

Speaker 1:          01:23:45       Hang in there buddy. On my feet right now. Those are pretty dope. Been retroed like four or five times and that's where those sell for $700 and they're like $160. Shoes and those look better. Those are Jordan's. They look cool. I've never wore a pair of Jordans my life. Really? Michael Jordan with my entire heart. Whoa. Whoa. I'm a 41 year old knicks fan. Just a one year old knicks fan out there right now. Fuck you. If you bought Jordan's, can't believe what you're saying. Yep. Stop the next championships. That's right. So, so you're just a loyal because he's a really good basketball player. You're loyal to the team that he crushed you. Loyal to his characteristics that you admire and you do on your own daughter. Yes. I respect. I, I fully respect that. I respect and understand he's the greatest basketball player of all time.

Speaker 1:          01:24:36       Right? Is he still, is that still a jam? That is probably right. I mean, listen, you want to get into the Wilton, there's some different ways to the bait that. Here's what I will say. You can say I hate when people argue with me on this. You can separate respecting somebody's skillset and thinking they're a piece of fucking shit, but you only thing he's a piece of shit because he beat your team. Yes, that's it. Isn't that more than a fuck enough? I guess. See Tom Brady choke would be phenomenally happy with that. If he died. Listen, I don't want to go there because I could never put it again right after Sunday. I'd be real happy. Real fucking happy. You just don't like that. He's really good and he wins. Correct. That's so weird. Expensive. My team see that, but that whole my team, I.

Speaker 1:          01:25:21       I understand if you own that team, but you don't own it yet. No, it's my escape, Joe. It's the one place I get to escape. It's my three hours fucking 16 times a year where I can recalibrate my whole fucking insane life. Well, I'm coming in from a perspective of weird perspective as a person who is a sports fan because my sports that I only watch her martial arts and as a fan of them, I'm a fan of performance more than I'm a fan of a person, so I'm not a fan. Like when I watch people fight, I'm a fan of whoever wins the fight. I'm a fan of how they win it. I'm a fan of what goes down. Not a bandwagon. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm a fan of technique. You love the craft. I love the craft and I also love. I love moments. I love someone dominating a moment. That is exactly right.

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       And I love when I don't have a horse in the race, so you always have a horse race when it comes to the ball and football and I used to in hockey and baseball, but my teams won championships and then I get out. All right, so you can if so, no baseball. So if you could appreciate someone who's a bad motherfucker, breaks the home run record. That stuff I get excited about. That's why I love that. That's what I liked. I liked boxing so much for that. I tend not to have a horse in the race. I usually root for the underdog. That's a good move. Yeah. It feels better when they win. That's usually my default. Yeah. When you. When someone is the favorite and they beat the shit out of, so I'm going to go. Well, I saw that coming when Tyson was in his prime. Those were weird fights because they were an execution fibrous cells and those were real event. Bruce Allen was post was posted by the way. Bruce Selden had, uh, uh, uh, no, that's smoke smoking. Burke Cooper, who I think of when I think about bruce selling because they had a similar body shape, jacked smoking. Burke Cooper, knockdown holyfield in Atlanta. Yeah. And I thought he had that excited. That's great. Fine. Holyfield.

Speaker 2:          01:27:08       Yeah. I mean there's a lot of great boxers, but Tyson had something going on where pop culture. Yeah, it was an executioner. Yeah. It's popcorn when they transcend into popcorn. The problem with that a lot of times is I feel bad for those, Rhonda. Right. Like the drop off is so extreme when you get to become a cultural icon. Yeah, but she's a real weird case because she's essentially done so you gotta wonder like her mindset when she was winning was this mindset of a destroyer. She would go in there and smash these girls and she was all in, but then she got wooed by Hollywood and all the distractions and movies and TV shows and all that nonsense and then bought into a bad strategy against one of the best strikers in the sport and fought the absolute worst way she could have fought against that elite striker and got fucked up and once she got fucked up, man the wheels came off.

Speaker 2:          01:28:11       She takes a whole year off and then comes back again and just gets annihilated and now dilated and now she's essentially done. Here's my biggest crazy mma in the modern world [inaudible], you lose the entire fight in within the time of an instagram post. You're in deep shit. You are, but you're not. See, because she beat cats in Ghana in 14 seconds and cat Zingano is still in the mix and mma, math is all fucked up, but it doesn't really work this way, but this is a fact. Cat Zingano stopped. Amanda Nunez, she beat her in the third round, but Ronda Rousey after that fight arm barred cat Zingano in 14 seconds, so I get those banana. What's really cool about Emma, I have said this, you may have caught the shame. It's the closest thing to entrepreneurship because everybody loses an entrepreneurship boxing's. Funny. That loss really dangles. It's devastating that loss.

Speaker 2:          01:29:06       I've been more fascinated from afar and I'm not as deep into sport, and you can correct me if I'm wrong, but there is an absolute different level because the way the sport is structured, there's an acceptance by the fan base of the loss in this sport that I think is very different than boxing. It's like it's a scarlet letter of boxing. When you're coming up, you need to keep it clean, right? You want to be undefeated and want to be an undefeated contender. It has a is a big factor and an MMA almost. No one is undefeated except number man off. He's one of the very few guys that's a top contender right now. That's undefeated and he's just a destroyer, but you know he's rare. He's. He's very rare. Most people at the top have lost a couple of times what connor showed when he lost, he showed the ability to regroup, take it on the chin like a fucking man.

Speaker 2:          01:29:51       Make no excuses whatsoever and jump right back in and when, and that's super, super rare. He's a phenomenal individual in his ability to visualize things. His belief in himself is just unflappable and his incredible confidence and ability to operate under pressure. That's the big thing, is being dwarfed by the moment, by the moment happened so many times, so much. People let allow those negative thoughts to creep into their mind. All those eyeballs. It's all fucking eyeballs, baby. A lot of eyeballs and a lot of doubt. What was the. What was the biggest audience you performed? What was the first time you took a quantum jump? Like what was the number? Did he go from like consistently doing like clubs? Then what was the first time like? What was that? Because I had a very weird thing happened to me with speaking. It was always like 500, 349 and then I got this weird Gig for remax natural national convention at the Mgm Grand, like 15,000 Jesus Christ.

Speaker 2:          01:30:51       And I was like, it was such a like. I mean, I would do it everyday if I could. It seems really bizarre, right? Like that's a yes, but I focused on the people that were closest to me. Okay. It worked for me. Yeah. That's a good move. That's the way to do it. And while taking into account all the people that aren't right there. Yeah. What about for you? What was the uh, well, I mostly started out with clubs for a long time, mostly did clubs. And then as I started getting more and more popular, I moved into larger places and the biggest place that I've ever sold out was in Denver, which was like 5,700 people. So that's a different experience, man. It's just weird. It's weird. Someone's addicted to their phones. Do you have another meeting tonight? What are you doing tonight? Doing a Biz Dev meeting.

Speaker 2:          01:31:42       Really Your Business Development meeting tonight at after 10:00 PM. That's hilarious. I, I normally. And you live in New York. So this is 1:00 AM for you. And I left at 4:00 AM this morning cause that's Chicago meeting soon. And speed. What are you doing? My brother still has a weird. No, I'm like seriously? What was super cool? I have, I've never even tried smoking a cigarette. Whoa. Yeah. Well that's good. Smoking cigarettes pot. No. Nothing. No, no, no much district rent of every one of my friends. And maybe make you a little bit more creative. Uh, I just think I have natural something because my brother literally thinks I'm a robot. Like literally as asked weird questions and passionate. If you're passionate, you're engaged. If you're engaged, you're excited. You know what I am energy grateful as fuck. Well that's good. Like if you really asked me what the slight variation of that is, I think it's gratitude.

Speaker 2:          01:32:35       Gratitude is huge. I think gratitude is a real drug, but I think it is too, so I'm just grateful, but certainly fuel its energy and its uh, its warmth and feeling also that's very attractive. Like other people recognize true gratitude and they get excited by it too. Yeah. And perspective. I think perspectives that other one. Oh, I agree. Yeah. Perspective is good, you know, being honest and humble and recognizing that yeah, you work hard. Yeah. You bust your ass. But yeah, you're also like super lucky just to be living in America for super lucky to be held into one. Yeah. Your Dad might've decided to jerk off one more time the day before. Right. And we wouldn't be here. Damn. 400 Janie. Your mom might've wanted to take a quick glass of wine, like 400 trillion to one. The odds of being a human being. No, seriously.

Speaker 2:          01:33:27       This is a little weird thing, but like we're going down this path, like I'm fascinated by that. Yeah. No, it's real. It's a real statistic. If you think about, come really start dividing and conquering. Understand that you can end up on your dad's. Come instead or Napkin instead of becoming a human trait. It's humbling. Yeah, it is a lot of ways. Yeah. But once that happens, once you become a human, once you become a human, then even then the odds of being fortunate to have good health, fortunate to not have been, have the fuck beat out of your body, your parents, or being in foster care with abusive people or a million different factors going down. You're going down the path that I think about on a daily basis. I also had the misfortune of three of my four grandparents dying before I knew them because everybody died in Russia and in their fifties because everybody's fucking miserable from communism.

Speaker 2:          01:34:16       And then, uh, so I haven't had a whole lot of death in my family. Like I had A. I mean, it's real good. So I'm grateful. Gratitude is giant man. It's really good. And you know what? And you can extend that gratitude. Like there's a lot of people that woe is me, but God damn it. You just need to look at, look at it in a balanced perspective. There are people in parts of the world that would fucking literally kill to be in any position that anyone listening to this who is woe is me right now. You know the problem with what was me? Nobody's fucking listening. My friends. Let me tell you who's listening to you complain either the two or three people that kind of have to because they're your parents or your other fucking losing

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       friends. Nobody gives a fuck. That's the problem when people don't understand about complaining isn't as zero Roi and also excuses. Excuses are terrible. They're the worst thing you could ever do is give yourself a reason why you're not successful or not happy or not this or not. That was easy for you to say, Gary. Yeah, because yeah, your dad, your dad's wine store, Bro. Fucking and here so happy. He started fucking youtube channel. Who will mud flaps to hit me with a belt if anybody's made it. That looks like you. That's it. That's it. So it must have happened. There's a blueprint, so I get it, man. Let's. What is even making it right? Well, that's your. Is Anybody happy? That's it. Are you, is anybody that's in similar circumstances, did they navigate their way better than you learn from them? Learn from them? I think for me the journey is the FEC and addiction, so he just loved the whole hustle of it all the game, you know?

Speaker 1:          01:35:55       It's funny. I was listening to you about like fighting and the performance. That's how I feel about business. Actually. Buying the jets is going to be the worst day of my life because then you're gonna need a new mountain to climb. Yeah. Started started crunching. I don't want that shit. You know what I want? I want to. I want to build a honey empire. Honey. Honey. Honey, I want to be able to bs. I want to build one of the most successful business things ever and I want to do it in a way that I treated my employees and my business partners in a honey manner. Oh, okay. Not actual honey. No. Honey like honey and vinegar or honey than vinegar. Right? Correct. Right. You get more. I was super pissed when Steve jobs was the icon in Silicon Valley and all my young friends started becoming dicks to their employees because they thought they were getting more out of their employees that way about him to narrative.

Speaker 1:          01:36:45       I fucking hate that, but I wish I knew what the actual truth was. I wish I got to see him communicate with his employees and see what it was that freaked them out. Like was he really a dick or did he work with a bunch of ne'er? Do Wells are lazy people were fools or you know what it is? Is it number one? Why he wanted to be number one? For sure he was a dick. He was definitely Dick. Listen, truth is back to the way you talk about steroid Houston, hugh, and I don't know. Right? I don't know her hard when a whole lot of human beings are saying it. Who worked for him? Yeah, I think he was absolutely completely obsessed and I think for a lot of people that really wasn't what they wanted. They wanted a job, you know, they want us to do good at their jobs, but I deploy empathy.

Speaker 1:          01:37:28       I know that other people have other goals and wants and needs and that shouldn't come. Mine mine, even though it's my company, it shouldn't come at their expense. It's my job as a leader to figure out how to provide for them and figure out what's left for me to do what I do. That's leverage, right? But what he wanted to do was create something unbelievably powerful and you had this supervision of it and he wanted everybody else to share that vision but not really necessarily share in the rewards of it, which is a big problem, right? Less. Listen, I am known. I don't know shit about him to critique it. Here's what I know. I don't like turtlenecks ready for this. Ready for this bottom line is he impacted an entire generation of young 25 year old silicon valley ceos who weren't smart enough and decided just to be assholes across the board for like two years there and it really suck.

Speaker 1:          01:38:18       So you would know that. I don't know anything about that. So explain to me what that was like because I'm just your, your miters we'll be talking to someone from another country, that whole era of like web two point. Oh that second wave, that 2004 that Kevin Rose, right. You know, who invented dig then you know, and xbox and Ed Williams and the investors Soka and all these characters. It was just a crazy thing. You knew he were sitting in again, it was kind of like hip hop, 85. Like I would go to these meetings, I would be in San Francisco, I would hang out with them and I just fucking knew I even have videos in 2009 like saying this ship and just knew I was like, these are going to be the fucking fucking characters that are going to be the next icons of the world because they're building the products that everybody's going to pay attention to.

Speaker 1:          01:39:00       And there were just a lot of things going on. At first it was pure shit. Like these kids really just wanted to save the world, right? Like let's make the world better with technology than they started having assholes. Like me come in who had commerce ambition and I'm like, yes, you save the world, but let me own 10 percent of the company while you save the moral. Right. And then you had the worst wave, which was the people who blindly just thought because they were 22 and wore a hoodie that they were going to invent the next facebook. Yeah. There's a lot of posers, right? You understand that there's a very big difference between being an entrepreneur and being a successful entrepreneur, right? Yeah. But the market right now, everyone's like, oh, you're a CEO and entrepreneur. Like, like as if you won. That's like me saying, I'm a basketball player. I play basketball, mom, I'm not making any fucking money. Right? And so yeah, we have a real issue in fake entrepreneurship right now. Everybody thinks, you know, it's cool. It became cool.

Speaker 1:          01:39:58       It's crazy to me how cool entrepreneurship became when I was a kid. Being an entrepreneur meant you were a loser and had an idea. You know, you're laughing because a lot of youngsters will listen. You don't know. Back in our day, like entrepreneur was a word that you rarely heard. I used to think I was a businessman. That's what I said, not an entrepreneur. You must hear a lot of really shitty ideas for living for a living because I get some email sometime and I'll get like one paragraph and I'll get the fuck outta here. What is this nonsense? And I just deleted. But you must get that like all day long, all day long.

Speaker 1:          01:40:34       It's hard to separate, right? Like how do you find those little diamonds? Sometimes you do and sometimes you don't. You have to take your ls. I have an email that I always look at from a good guy named Joe and he worked at a company called air bed and breakfast. Joe At air bed and breakfast. Gary Vee were huge fans here at our company. We'd love for you to never even replied. Now airbnb is worth a lot of money. Fucking money. Email for my boy. Ben Layer, founder of thrillist. Send me an email like, hey, I really like these guys. You should look at it. Didn't jump on it or be Parker big glass company, you know, like it happens. That's a weird one. Right? Who saw that? A glasses company was going to be giant, but other times you know Venmo. Zappos knew it right away.

Speaker 1:          01:41:18       Like, you know, it happens. I mean it goes both ways. I saw Amazon.com. I was like, bitch, how much money you gonna make selling books? Yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I use it every day. I'm from the generation where people made fun of my dad for because I didn't open a second wine store and I went on the Internet. The Internet's youngsters. Listen real quick. People debated the Internet itself. Forget about. Is snapchat going to be here in five years? Back in 1994. Five, six, seven, eight. People like the Internet not going to be here in five years. Go earlier than that. When ibm first came out with their home computer thing, that's ridiculous. Of course, that's a joke. Telephone is not a viable product. One said. Yeah. By the people that didn't want the telephone to win, nobody saw a lot of things coming. So what should we do, Gary Vee?

Speaker 1:          01:42:06       What's wrap this up? What should we do? What should people do? People should fucking stop complaining, right? People should figure out how the fuck they are. Good people should not listen to America. Propaganda of fixing the shit they suck at. They should be tripling down on what they're good at. They should be competent in certain areas, but you're not gonna become beyonce or your bone structure is a certain way like you're not going to solve everything. Your Iq can get a little bit better, but don't worry about the incremental. Figure out what you fucking puts you on fire and you're halfway decent at. If you're lucky enough right now to be listening and you're good at what you like become tunnel fucking vision because there's way too many voices telling you what and how. And here's the other thing, and this is the big one job, because you have a humongous audience.

Speaker 1:          01:42:54       The biggest thing that I've seen dividends from have the conversation with the person that's holding you back. The reason most people who are listening right now are not doing that thing is they're worried about the opinion of somebody, usually their mother, usually their father, and the reality is is that your spouse may be the person holding you back and you have to have that conversation. Turn them off. We have to get to a place where you're doing you because the number one thing that scares the fuck out of me is regret, and you're gonna. Sit there at 72 and I'm going to say, I wish I wish, I wish, and whether that's money or spend more time with your family. There's a million ways to do this. Not everybody wants to buy the jets. Not everybody wants to smoke weed on the beach and Bahamas, like everybody's got a different fucking thing. Figured out what your fucking thing is and stop making fucking bullshit excuses who the president is. Your mom did this like, like, I missed it. You had that idea for Uber. Then why didn't you fucking do it, Dick? That's

Speaker 3:          01:43:52       what I think. Joe.

Speaker 2:          01:43:54       Better words have never been spoken. Jerry, you're a bad motherfucker. Thank you, sir. Pleasure meeting you. So glad you did this. Thank you. Good night everybody. We'll be back tomorrow. Episode nine slash 11 with fucking Alex Jones. That's right. You heard it. And Eddie Bravo. Holla.
