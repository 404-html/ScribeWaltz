Speaker 1:          00:02:20       We're also brought to you by legal zoom. Legal Zoom is an awesome way that you can handle a lot of legal issues without leaving your house. It used to be that you would have to go to a lawyer and make an appointment and pay a lot of money to resolve. Simple things like power of attorney, living trusts, wills, you can do all that stuff online. Now through legal zoom. They've been handling it for over 10 years. They have an a plus with the better business bureau and they've helped protect people's assets with Llcs, s corporations, trademarks, real estate documents, and more. Even allegedly. I mean I've seen it on the website offered divorce, but I would like to look at. I would like to look at how many people have

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       actually got divorced through legal zoom. A grueling 10 years with legal. Yeah. People to it out, man. I was listening to this interview with this guy was talking about how much money you had to pay. Some famous guy was telling you mention his name, but he's talking about how much money, how to pay out in a divorce and freaking out about it. That's war with some people. More old stories to say about how your friend had to pay for his own wife's. I'm going through it. I wonder if I could use legal zoom. Got divorced. What's his name? Gary. Let us get married. Why would they let us get married and begin with skin fight? We can't be married each other. Anyway, go to legalzoom.com. Dad, why are you marrying him and see if you can get divorced from your boyfriend or your husband? Whatever. My Dad, whenever a gay dude says my husband, I was just go.

Speaker 3:          00:03:52       Okay. I got it. It takes a second. You know what I'm saying? I'm not judging, but you said husband, right? Your guy. All right. Oh, okay. All right, well don't you believe it's possible. I'm not homophobic at all, but if I see and I live in New York where if you see two guys making out, you're still like weird word a little still. Well it's always going to be if you're a heterosexual because for the most part you don't see it until you reach an adult age and then you're out in the wild with the wild homosexuals that just frequent these uh, thoroughfares and there's avenues and spot. Like if you go down Santa Monica Boulevard and probably we should probably just start the podcast right here. Is there different levels of that where you look at c, two people kissing and you're just like, you know what, I'm a little hungry for that.

Speaker 3:          00:04:36       Or like, oh my God, that's hot. Is it at all? Like on and off, you think like some people look go to who? What are you saying? Like if you're walking down the street and see anybody walking on the street, two guys kissing each other I ever say, is that, is it completely hilarious and weird? Or is it like mildly? Like, oh, I see what they're doing there, or is it like, because that seems to be talking to this question now way, way before you tried to express yourself in such a complex manner. It seems very like I wonder if there's different levels because I'm, I'm, I'm like, that's hilarious and creepy and weird. It depends on what the guys look like because there's a broad spectrum of masculine to feminine homosexuals just like there are, you know, like women look different, you know? I mean if, if you run into to have a certain type of women making out, it's not fun, but if know it's uncomfortable, but if you run into women that are just whatever, for whatever reason they flow together well visually, but if to Brad Pitt's we're kissing or Brad Pitt and George Clooney never be hot to me because I'm a straight male, what I would sympathize, I would say, you know what's weird that I would judge and then I would hope that they don't run into anybody.

Speaker 3:          00:05:47       That's mean I do that. Would you take a photo? No, that's rude to have you stolen. Just make like against a telephone pole. Depends if someone, they started taking

Speaker 4:          00:05:58       their pants off, I'd probably start filming, started going after it, but then you get caught with gay porn on your phone and then illegally acquired gay porn. You're a bad person and you're. Yeah, you're not supposed to be just fill in people. I don't think you're supposed to just film people, you know. I don't know what the rules are like about. I guess if you do something publicly should be assumed that you're filming it, but if you just took film of some guys, make it out and put it on Youtube. If you make a website called Joe News, you could just say you just hang one of those signs around your neck, like when they do for TV shows, like filming in progress to assume that you will be shown. Yeah. Legalzoom.com. That gives a codeword Rogan. He goes out with all these questions. I don't think they can do.

Speaker 4:          00:06:37       You can hire an attorney. Legal Zoom was developed by top attorneys to provide self help services at your specific direction, but they're not a law firm. Um, they will provide you with a third party attorney though if the shit hits the fan. I have to say all this before we get done with this. Otherwise we'll be stuck in this commercial for an hour. Anyway, we've, we've used legal zoom. Brian used it to a form desk squads. Aubrey used it to make on it. It's a, it's an awesome service. So you go to legalzoom.com and use the codeword Rogan. And last but not least, we're brought to you by [inaudible] dot com. That is o n n I t a human optimization website. And on it is right now releasing the newest of our artistic kettlebells, Werewolf Kettlebell, the legend bells. We have the Zombie Bells of course, which I think we're out of.

Speaker 4:          00:07:25       I think that's what's going on. The website here, I'm sure there's armed rebels were out of them. Still have the great apes. We still have some of those and we will. I'm sure we'll have the Zombie bills back because they were fucking awesome. We've got some other ones that are coming out too. We've got some new ones. Oh, that's nice, man. Yeah, the wearables dope, it's heavy as fuck to the Werewolf is a big one. It's 65 pounds, 28 kilograms, 60 to 62 pounds, so it's a good one to work out with hurt. They hurt if you do any kind of like a foot to flip it over and your risks. Like I used to do one with a skull and yeah, we just cracked my wrist. Well you got to do is first of all, you got to make sure that the face is outside facing the opposite direction.

Speaker 4:          00:08:04       That's a simple solution. I guess that's what you do, but that's hard to do when you're tired. But the other thing is you got to learn the technique of like punching through. Like when do you swing a kettle bell? There's a certain amount of control that you develop with it where it doesn't ever hurt your arm because then like a lot of times people when they're starting out especially they'll put like risk things on like they're trying to get an eagle to land on their arms cushion things so that when the Kettlebell flips and hits it, it doesn't hurt. But you get, you get to know what, what's moving. You're supposed to like twist it sorta twisted towards you first and then as you're going up you sort of punched through it and then it's a. If you do it in a smooth motion, never really slams in your arm.

Speaker 4:          00:08:44       But the thing is if you're doing them right, you're going to get tired. When you get tired, that's when your techniques suffers. That's when you can. You could fuck yourself up. Oh, techniques. Suffering is. I've done some doing crossfit. I did so much damage because I just never. We've worked hard on good form. It's so important. Yeah. Welcome to the club. There's so many people that have hurt themselves doing that kind of stuff. Those a power lifting exercises, you know, especially I'm Steve, I'm a maxwell who's a real expert in fitness and the guy who's, he's in incredible shape, he's 62 years old. You guys are just an animal and just a wealth of knowledge. He's not a fan of those type of workouts because he said that those power lifting workouts should all be done with very strict form and very heavy weights and very low reps and he's like, so they're essentially taking these, these workouts that are all about this one big explosion and the most you can get up and they're doing them over and over and over and over and over and over and some people can get away with that, but some people get really fucked up.

Speaker 4:          00:09:41       Well, they also have the element of like competition to it, which I never really bought into because I was just doing it like trying a lot of weight and get in shape. So I just. I looked at it as like whatever was on that board was my workout, but there was a competition element so it is funny that they spend. But the first 15 minutes of any crossfit class I've done is showing you the form of today's workout is the proper dead lift. This is a proper clean power clean, and then they do that for 15 minutes. Then they go, all right as fast as you can now for seven minutes, and it's like crazy, you know, and these people are competitive people and they want to win, so gosh, just like you just see how they're bent over the wrong way and just like putting so much on your back for anybody that's thinking about doing any kind of workout with either kettlebells or even just regular weights, just dumbbells or barbells, please start off slow.

Speaker 4:          00:10:27       If you've never done any workout before, working out is all about. It's tearing down your muscle fiber and then heels and when it heals, it gets stronger. You have to tear it down and then you have to recover. The recovery is one of the most important parts and that's one of the things that fucks up a lot of athletes. It's one of the number one issues when it comes to wrestlers, like a lot of wrestlers because there's so mentally tough. They overtrain they fuck their whole body up because your body's never getting the proper rest. You don't. If you're not a competitive athlete, that's in some sort of a program. We can't. You can't decide how much workout you you have to do because you have to follow a team. If you're not in that kind of an athletic program and you can do it yourself, be fucking smart about it.

Speaker 4:          00:11:04       It's hard to do because everybody wants to just. God Damn it, I've been a fat ass. I've been eating donuts and drinking cokes. I need it just I'm going to clean up my diet and I'm gonna work out like an animal. If you do it too hard, too quick, you rip things apart, you will. You're. Your body's not developed for it. You've got to build up to those kinds of workouts. That's why. That's why like steroids. That's what they do is they help you heal fast. He could work out harder. I think it's such a funny misconception always, but steroids were even in movies that would make it like, you know, it's like they stick steroids and druggos arm and he could just win fights. You know what I mean? People always treated with Barry bonds like that. They were like, he takes steroids, like he injected into his arm so we can crack home runs they go, still requires a ton of extra workout. It was gonna work harder still than anybody else. Definitely, but you definitely have an advantage over everybody else who works on it without an argument. I mean none of these guys are taking it and then

Speaker 1:          00:11:53       just being world leaders are taken and working out like demons and then being world beers. Yeah, there's a lot a lot going on with that stuff, but the real problem with it is the crashes, their endocrine systems fucks up their body. I was watching this, this thing on bodybuilders, men's videos watch this online where this guy was interviewing a bodybuilder. I responded to them. It's my timeline yesterday. It's the craziest shit ever. Has Dude who was a big time competitive bodybuilder, talked about how he got into it and talked about all the stuff that he was dumping into his body and it's like, whoa, fucking pain pills every day. Vikatin steroids this, that is his kid. He's like 30. His kidney was like ready to go. Like they were like, dude, you're going to be on dialysis in a year. Like it's over. Like you're going to have to need new kidneys.

Speaker 1:          00:12:37       Like you're usually just crashing the whole party. Just take giant purple, fucking great monster. What needle marks and fucking feigns everywhere and they just get addicted. Get addicted to that thing of sticking chemicals in your body and make your body bigger and training like a monster. You'd call them a junkie too if it was like if you saw what they did, they have like, you know, a plate or we. I grew up with, my stepfather was a competitive power lifter, so he was a new. A lot of friends who were bodybuilders and stuff. And you see these guys have like a plate of pills in front of him everyday. Oh my God. Wow. That's so crazy. Chunky behavior. Not Yeah, that's not a healthy folks, but yeah, junkie behavior exists in a lot of forms. Existing gambling. Gambling is the big one. I'm around so many people.

Speaker 1:          00:13:23       I know so many people that have really crazy gambling problems. That video they just put up, keeps going to be on the podcast. We're working it out right now. It looks like he'll be on October 10th. Really looking forward to having him on and talk to him that the video is the best workout video I've ever had. The extreme kettlebell cardio workout series. They're so brutal. It's all you need folks. You don't need a gym membership. DVD cost 30 bucks. You take one Kettlebell, a 35 pound Kettlebell in. It will fuck you up. I mean literally you don't need any more equipment and that Kettlebell will be around to the end of time. It's solid metal. Those things, they're so fucking durable. You never have to worry about them breaking. I mean you buy one, you have that for life. You can pass those things including the artistic ones, the Werewolf and the chimpanzee.

Speaker 1:          00:14:07       Those are solid cast steel. I mean those are iron kettle bells. These are like the old Russian metal. I guess it's. I guess it's. I guess it's iron, but the Russians were the ones who develop these things. This, this design. I mean, there's some of them, they make some of them that are like aluminum on the outside of their, kind of waited on the inside. These are not those, these are solid, solid metal and they're awesome. You can't get like any better quality kettlebells. We found the best ones you can get online and they're a little more awkward in some ways to lift with then some of the what they call competition kettlebells that are larger kettlebells but lighter. But that awkwardness I think is good. You know, everybody's trying to do fucking comfortable with these God damn things they're difficult to use and I do. That's how I do

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       my squats. Now I've put a 70 in each hand and do those things. It's awesome. Go all the way down to your ass, touches your calves and just think you're fucking fighting for your life. Think that Werewolf's are chasing you and shit. Are you holding onto it? I do. I think they're like my life's in danger. I think I'm like, I'm on a hunting trip, but I'm trying to get up a tree and a bear's chasing me or something like that. Were Werewolf ones like or like right here going. It's probably so we're referred to that kind of trading. It's like a like apocalypse trading because all functional movement. Yeah. What could you do? Functional movement is like, it's huge doing pull ups and stuff like that. Even just those basic movements like it's amazing how I can't do a pull up still. Like if I was, if I remember always feeling that feeling.

Speaker 3:          00:15:34       If you were like falling from a building movies, they'll catch themselves in the legend there. Like going to delay me dying for a couple more seconds. Like I could not possibly pull my bot. Maybe. Maybe with an adrenaline shot I shoot up, but something tells me if I had to pull my own body weight up a building, I'd be gone. If you got to catch yourself by hand, you'd have to be like one of those park core dudes shirt, super gymnast dudes. Most of us would just spazz off the building and fucking crashed to our death and we're gonna be at coke nails. They would promise Werewolf evoke nails. Have you ever seen those Russian guys who go out on like the cranes? I can't watch that much. It makes my legs feel weird. A on a.com o n and N it. We don't have to end this mean we can end this rather.

Speaker 3:          00:16:19       We don't have to do any music. Fuck it. We're just talking a use a codeword Rogan and save 10 percent off any and all supplements. A lot of new shit in including, uh, if you haven't had it yet though. The warrior bars, which are the most awesome fucking thing ever. This thing that we had made a, it's an ancient lakota recipe. It's a organic buffalo meat. I'm bringing stacks of these when I go up to Alaska, no antibiotics, no added hormones, and it's got 14 grams of protein and a 140 calories. Four grams of fat for every two hours serving very healthy for you. All kinds of cool shit on it. And again, use the codeword Rogan save 10 percent off any and all supplements Bra and cue the music.

Speaker 3:          00:17:01       Is it fucking up again? Now you'd say he didn't want to do music. So I. Oh, you already unplugged it. That's how wonky are fucking system is. Needed. A better system, but we can't just unplug play. I usually unplug it just. And nothing bad happens. Like in the middle of it, I get like an instant message or something. And you're like, what the fuck was that? Did you get instant messages on your ipad? No, but I'm saying if something like that were to happen, you know, bigj lit up dog. Yeah Buddy. Thanks for coming in, man. Thank you for having me. It's very exciting. But is that, is that an e cigarette? You know, Congress is trying to fucking band those finally. That's fine. The stepping in, the government's stepping up and ending these evil, evil e-cigarettes that are stealing money from the mouths of the babies of the families that own the tobacco companies, which is Marlboro.

Speaker 3:          00:17:49       Who makes your preferred brand logic. And I deal with the logic zero. No Nicotine. Yeah. Oh, I see, so it's like a, just a habit thing. Crutch. Yeah, but I haven't actually looked yesterday on my 29 days from a year. That's interesting. That's interesting. Like a zero tobacco thing that just fills the habit because it's just a habit, a pure water, pure water vapor. Wow. And there's no feeling whatsoever. Do you get like a little mental thing that happened? Was mental thing? Yeah. When I get the itch to go with things I've always wanted to do. What are you putting up?

Speaker 2:          00:18:23       They just a New York just said that now a e-cigarettes are allowed to have paid commercials during movies now and this is not, they haven't had that for 16 years since regular cigarettes were. Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. You mean before the movie? Like paid product placements. Oh, but wait a minute, that's not a product placement. Is that before the movie or in the movie? Hey, product placements in films has been off limits for tobacco companies for 16 years, so now they're allowed to have paper. Like in movies there's, they're allowed to be paid. So what you're saying is like if you watched the incredibles or whatever and they'll pull it out. Cigarettes, they're getting paid for that.

Speaker 3:          00:19:03       It's white story. Well, I was going to say, um, oh, what's the November man with the new one? With the peers fellow. So if he's smoking a cigarette, it's one of those things, right?

Speaker 2:          00:19:15       If he gets paid to do it, that's so weird.

Speaker 3:          00:19:18       That's that they do that on television, you know, like you'll, you'll only be able to use like Mac computers on some shows. Clearly obvious to. I was using number American idol and every judge happened to be drinking a coke turned out to the right. Well there's that too. And there's just, there's also like on certain shows, like you'll see everything. Even movies you'll see, like every product is a Sony and they'll say they'll close up on the Sony phone when someone gets a phone call. So you see the Sony logo and it'll be on a vial laptop and you'd go, oh, Sony has a deal in this movie

Speaker 2:          00:19:48       actually when it's not so many, it seems like it's always like they always use apple computers and they always have the sticker over the apple logo or iphones, but they have the apple logo covered up for some reason and like every single TV show. So it's almost like apples, like, no, obviously hold on, you have to pay us to show the APP. No, no, no. You've got it totally wrong. Totally opposite. They don't get paid by apple. So they cover it up. That's what it is. If apple paid them than they would have. We're not going to advertise your thing, but isn't it weird that it seems like every show does use apple products and all their shows.

Speaker 3:          00:20:19       They want to, you know, there's like a cult of apple in Hollywood for sure. You know, I'm not sucking my Dick, but I did a show called P diddy's bad boys or comedy on Hbo. And that was, it turns out that was just an entire season of a TV show to promote Sean John Clothing. Really? Or they made you, you had to, were showing John Closing. Yeah. You when you did sleep dress and definitely hip hop clothes. That's great. It's really meant you had to wear their clothes to do standup and all they could find in my was a short

Speaker 5:          00:20:48       sleeve like zip up sweater that said, show you how across the front room. Oh my God. That was about 70 pounds heavier than I am now. You did, you did stand up with uh, Sean John Shirt on because they made you wear it. Oh yeah. I mean I did, but coming, if he was at my pant leg rolled up in my first year of commodity, I think one pant leg rolled up, like ll cool J. I bought it in full wigger. I went hard on it. Did you, for how long? Just you know what it was. I figured out. I started out in a black comedy room and I just found out I could fucking destroy if I just went right to them on that level. Now I actually load that kind of comedy and it's fun to expose that. Like the white guy who goes into a black room just like, come on, y'all know when you buy a bitch or drank, that bitch won't go away.

Speaker 5:          00:21:32       I'm going to go dancing with dead drunk bitch. I bought it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because you know every job you up in a club where there's a few white guys who take on that role was zealous intention. There's a few of those white guys. There's always like one or two of those out there to like get known as a white guy who does black rooms. How man? Well, yeah, Gary. Oh, and I've watched him. It blows my goddamn. I have no idea. It's like, let's say it's like listening to what? What's funny is that when you, if they turn the microphones off on the audience, you'd be like, and you said there was all black people in the audience. You'd be like, well, they're probably furious right at what's happening. Like the basically being called clowns, like they won't understand a white guy unless he does this and then you turn on the volume of the audience and they're just roaring high five and just losing their shit and he'll see like, really?

Speaker 5:          00:22:20       It's such like a. it's such a grand scheme. Pander. It's blows my mind. You're allowed to do that panda though. As long as it's positive, you're allowed to do that. Pander. Good. It seems phony. It seems so phone. It seems really funny because there's guys I worked with in the black circuit when I started that like fantastic comics, black like bill burr used to do some of those rooms, you know, but isn't it weird that like no one has any issue whatsoever with a black guy who does like alternative comedy, like that really dead Pan, you know? No one's going to white, nerdy comedy. No. No one would say he's taking on the affectation of the white nerds. No, but I'll tell you what, that guy eats shit. And a real black comedy room. He the black right? The black. The black nerd is not accepted by the white guy who acts like a black guy eat shit and a lot of white comedy clubs. Yeah. That's what happened when I first came to New York and I would say, wow, it's so crazy that they make you wear their clothes. This lady would not stop hunting. You couldn't for say. No. Couldn't say as a part of the part of the deal. Yeah. There was also some contract where a in that where it's like he was your manager for like three years beyond that show or something like managerial cut of anything because assuming anything you got

Speaker 4:          00:23:47       a moving forward from pdds baby boys of comedy somehow was because because of p diddy. That's no joke man. I've seen that in reality show contracts. I've seen that we're friends, we're thinking about going on a reality show and they brought the contract to someone and it turns out like say if you're like, ah, you know, if they created some new show, like a real housewives type show, and then you became like the breakout star and took off and had like cookbooks and shit. Like a lot of these chicks do and started making bank. They get paid. They get a big fat piece of that. Man That's not all yours on some of these contracts. Oh yeah. Because you'll be. It'll even be called like oxygen networks, whatever chick presents. Yeah. It could be when you're allowed to use that in your credit, you know, like as seen on Sean diddy's, bad boys of comedy, you're allowed to use that.

Speaker 4:          00:24:32       You know what I'm saying? They'll own you like they're saying that you have no value other than the value that they gave. You mean they own it. Like they don't just, they don't benefit from having a talented person on a show that rewards them and gives them ratings, which in turn gives them more advertising. No, no, no, no, no. They want a piece of your future prosperity, your future prosperity based on you being an entertaining person that they put on television. So not only do they want to pay people just to shit tiny amount of money, then they want to script what they're doing, but then treat them like they're not even actors. They're treating them like they're these weird slaves. These robots that are out there in the world. Yeah, because I know actors let anybody do that. You can't, you don't get on a Sitcom and they say, okay, we own all your book sales and you fucking, you know, anything you do in the movies or anything from here on. But the reality stars though, are you totally against it because there's some issue of the reality stars though are completely made by the network they are though. But uh, yeah, but how is it any different than actors? Because actors are better at it because there, there is a skill there. Yeah, there's something. It's like, what about the ones that suck?

Speaker 4:          00:25:41       But I mean like, do you think like a Snooki should always give some kickback to Ltv to some degree? No, I don't. I just recording Ramsey. Well, hit singles. I think those are his shows. Know he's on like four different shows. Yeah. But I think those are his show. Yeah. He creates, you know what I'm saying? Like he's, he's a pretty famous dude. That's not a good example. And he also has a skill. It's like he's a world renowned chef. It's not like Snooki, you know what I'm saying? I mean you're talking about the guy was already famous. If it depends on what you do though, if you're like the guy who was on the bachelor and he owns like a horse stable. If after that show, the horse stables business picks up huge. I don't think there should be any kickback for some like that.

Speaker 4:          00:26:19       But if he does something moving on like another reality, just like the bachelor all stars, whatever thing. Sure. I think to some degree too, I think that's crazy talk. I think a person who working for you when they're doing something like that, if you're a producer of a television show or a executive in a network or what have you, who I don't know who's getting the money, then you hire someone. You're hiring someone because you think that they're going to be the best performer in this production that you're putting on. No, let's stop pretending the reality. The only reality show is fucking cops. Okay. You know, it's a reality show because one of the guys got shot and killed the other day because it's real. Really, really hard. Yeah. One of the sound guys and they filmed the whole thing like regular cops style. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:26:59       The guy got shot and killed the fucking sound guy. Did. That's, that's the only real reality videos out there. No, it hasn't been released yet. It's really recent thing. Um, but when you're watching a lot of these shows, whether it's about selling cars or you know, whether it's about being in a pawn shop, it's all rigged is everybody knows what the subject's going to be beforehand. They know what the scenario is, the painting. So you're basically an actor, you're in some quads. I actor. Okay. They can't, they put you on the show. Say if we do fucking big, big Jay's grill house. And uh, I decided, fuck it, I'm going whole hog. And then you see like a hog spinning around thing. Big Chad do stand up comedy. But I also love cooking. So I decided to open up and then they, they, what? They own you, they own you, they own a piece of you forever.

Speaker 4:          00:27:48       Shit. The reason why they want you on the show in the first place with some crazy housewives that fucking gets pilled up and start screaming at people or whether you're charlie sheen, if he ever does a reality show the reason why they want you because because they think people are going to tune into you and they're going to benefit from that. Like they can't. They can't own you because they made you fuck off. No, you're right. And I guess it is talking about originally, I can't remember who you're talking about. Not talking about anybody in specific. I'm talking about these reality shows, reality shows where they take people. And you know, we're talking about him being forced to wear those shirts and I'm saying that these, these shows that like, like him saying that he was going to be managing him for three years afterwards.

Speaker 4:          00:28:26       They, they connect people in these weird ways where they'll own you for a long time after your thing. They'll get a kickback. But I guess you're right. Even in the example that I use, I guess like Snooki really like she was cast to do so in essence he is an actor. When that camera's on you, man, let's be real. It's very difficult for people to be themselves. It's just very difficult when the camera's on you and say ready, go. You're performing whether you're performing in some weird sort of, uh, uh, uh, uh, sitcomish reality show. That's just not, it's not based on real. I know what the fuck is really going on. Like you see Alan Thicke show what data Alan thicke had this reality show. You would watch him and go, why don't you just do a sitcom? Like it's just so set up. So set up everything is Gene Simmons, things like that too, right?

Speaker 4:          00:29:15       It's sad and I love him. Simmons. I Love Gene Simmons. You have a kiss shirt on. I love kiss. I found a letter the other day that Paul Stanley's coming in. I found a letter the other day that I read. I wrote rather to some magazine when I was 11 years old. Like a kiss letter. Yeah. My mom saved it, so I'm going to bring it in. Read it to Paul Stanley. What's it? What's this new shit? Don't they have a new set of Gene Simmons show him and Paul Stanley up some arena football show. I don't know what he was

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       doing, but the reality show that reality show, those are hard to watch, especially with ones like why is Mark Walberg doing a reality? Like killing it in life, but yeah, but he's getting exposed as being a doofus by his reality show. That's what I mean. It makes them look like. It just looks like it looks good. Desperate move. When it's not. Well he's not. He's a narcissistic move. I think it's that. I think he probably wants to help all those other people out. That's helped his brothers. Yeah. He's helping his brothers and his family out. It's helping them like actually help feel like giving them money so it's like come around a little bit. I guess having him a part of it without a doubt. I mean he's a mega movie star. Having him a part of it ensures it's success. People want to see mark Walberg hanging around with his family, period.

Speaker 3:          00:30:25       I'll watch. I'll watch a show, a reality show that I find interesting to some degree at least give it a couple of chances. I couldn't and I. I've very much enjoyed mark Walberg. Yeah, but I couldn't even drum up a reason to give it a shot to watch that other than other than other than to watch it for the wrong reasons and if he's welcoming that. That's kind of weird. Well, we were saying earlier I think is really true about these reality shows being completely scripted, but the reason why is because these kinds of shows can happen where they're just boring. Nothing's happening. You know, if the Kardashians are fighting with their mom or fighting with her boyfriend and this guy's out of rehab, that girl's pregnant. It's always like something you're tuning into, there's always some chaos so they know how to hook you up with the best one is the best show by far and I recommend that actually like watch it, it's great.

Speaker 3:          00:31:10       Even if you skim through it on Dvr, the bad girls club, I could watch that over and over pieces of shit. I mean these chicks are garbage and they fight online. They, they fight over immediately out of the gates. It's like, this bitch thinks she's cute and they're like, what'd you say? Bitch? And then they ended the hospital fights fights again to the hospital will, that's how they stay on television. Oh yeah. Then the producers come out and they say like, look, we let you guys fight. You know, it happens. But you did, you hit her in the, in the eyeball with a high heel. So we're gonna we're gonna have to ask you to leave. And that's a good teary. Like, you know, I'm going to miss my girls. It's fucking ridiculous. Bought with Ohio. Yeah man. And, and people will take things to the next level because that's how you get noticed.

Speaker 3:          00:31:58       If you don't take things to the very next level, you don't get noticed. Yeah, I mean that's why I mean the UFC such a great example that buried boxing, you know what I mean, like sort of has. Well the problem with boxing is there's only like a few big stars that is like a few fights that you want to see and it's just going to punch it like the flood wave of whether my Donna fight this past weekend, maybe whether there's a master, he's a master boxer. It's beautiful to watch. I mean, he really knows how to fight. I mean he's just one of the rare real like him and Bernard Hopkins. James Tony is a good example. Just a real, uh, Andre Ward. Just boxing masters. Like if you understand how difficult it is, what they're doing, it's amazing. But you're watching a guy paint a really beautiful

Speaker 5:          00:32:39       picture where in mma you get that too and you get to satisfy that gladiator. Hers. You want to see two guys fight. I get my ears perk up on any time I see people fighting on the street or anything. It's like, yeah, yeah. Well, the, the, this, the added elements of takedowns and chokes and slams and it makes them more crazy kicks. And if you're a guy who was a fighter, if you're a young man who can box the reason why there's no stars, I think you're almost like, oh, I could probably learn some spin kicks. And really, that's such a much more glorious way to win this. You know, the cage, like, you know, Anthony Pettis, cage kicks, wins are like the prettiest thing you've ever better than any, you know, or, or at least tied with any great Tyson knockout it.

Speaker 4:          00:33:23       Uh, there's that fight that we were talking about earlier where a student, as a black girl attacks, uh, a teacher and start slapping. Don't, don't say what it is and show it. All right, we're going to get in trouble for this. Now there's this world star hip hop. No, I think it's the news was on the news as someone film it with their iphone. So it happened. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:33:46       No.

Speaker 4:          00:33:54       Oh my God. She's attacking the teacher. Whoa. This is crazy. This chicken just swinging at the teacher.

Speaker 6:          00:34:04       Oh, judo, hip toss her and held her down.

Speaker 4:          00:34:12       Whoa, that's crazy. That's cool. Needs crazy. Joe Clark. Holy. They need to lean on me. Principal. I think I would have went more crazy. He handled it way better than if that chick started slapping me. Well, this is. This gets into the subject of what we're talking about the other day with a Anthony Kumiai getting hit on the street while he's taking photographs. People don't react well. Deck. I reacted very well to getting hit. He didn't hit back. A lot of people just hit back when they, when they get hit and if you're. Especially if you're a man and you're hitting a woman, anytime people are hitting people. If a woman hits you, it's fucking dangerous, man. Getting punched in the face is like everybody thinks that a woman could punch you in the face and you're going to be fine. Like, no. There's a lot of women that are knock you the fuck out man.

Speaker 4:          00:34:55       If they. Especially if they connect on your jaw, you can't be hitting people and if you can't, you know, if you do hit people, man, you gotta be really careful who you're hitting because if they hit you back, like if that guy just decided to tee off on that check, I mean you see through her to the ground. That's a guy who knows martial arts for sure, and he was avoiding all of her hitting him, but he wasn't hitting her back. But if he did, man, you're running in flailing your arms and some guy uncorked one on your face. You fall back, you're unconscious, you're going to bounce your head off the ground and sometimes people die from that shit and that's a real problem. When people get knocked out, they fall down and they hit their head on the ground and die. It's like you're pretty much maybe having a really bad car accident with your face, which yeah, it's just like that.

Speaker 4:          00:35:37       It's, the ground is completely like, there's, there's, it resists 100 percent. Like there's no give to it. Like if you fall in dirt, you're going to be probably okay. You know, like if you fall in a grassy area, you'll get a concussion, but you might crack your head wide open if you fall on concrete block. I've seen him like a bowling ball. You ever talked a bowling ball, that sound? Imagine that your head and the amount of distance that your head travels of, you're a six foot tall man and someone knocks you out. You're probably going to travel a good five and a half, six feet. I mean, depending on how you're standing, you go unconscious. You're, that's a lot of probably more than six feet because it's, you know, you're going to fall back first to. I mean there's probably going to be a lot of momentum connected to your head bouncing off that concrete.

Speaker 4:          00:36:25       It's awful. It's awful. Those fucking videos freak me out, man. It was a five videos, face kicks and stuff. I can't believe I'm almost like so shocked at the mentality of someone that can do inflict harm on somebody. I always think that there's a lot of them out there that people aren't aware of, so I'm not shocked when I see it. I'm always like, I fucking knew it. I know there's people like that out there. I know there's people that have experienced this awful shit from the time they were born. If you grow up in a household where everybody's beating the fuck out of everybody and you go to school and people beat the fuck out of everybody and you see abuse and you see people going to jail left and right and life has no value and you've seen people die. That's what you're seeing when you watch those Worldstar hip hop tapes were a dudes out cold and guys are running by just punting them in the head.

Speaker 4:          00:37:14       I've seen a bunch of those. Yeah, me too. I was always like, it's like it's shocking that someone can do it to somebody else. That's a wake up call for people. Unless you're in. If your life was directly threatened and you were in that kind of a rage maybe, but I mean once somebody down like I don't know. I've been in. I've been in, let's say for a, for a guy my age, a decent amount of street fights in my life, but I've never. I've never had like a kill urge ever, you know, I've lost, I've won, but even when I, when like when it's over, it's kind of over, you know what I mean? I've never like tried to put somebody like that, you know? It will depend on why you're fighting. Right. But even if like, I don't know if it was a guy beating the shit out of your girlfriend, you know what I'm saying?

Speaker 4:          00:37:53       Sure. You know what I'm saying? Like what if you pulled up somewhere and just got there right when a guy was beating the shit out of your garage. I'm not saying not to knock them out, but I mean like to punch somebody's head. Like I don't know if that, I just don't know where my killer rage kicks in. Like actual murderous rage. I don't know where that level is in me. Yeah, I think it's pretty deep. I'm pretty mellow dude. I've. Yeah, but I think if you were confronted, I mean you might be, I don't know, I don't know you, but if you were confronted by someone that you were trying to protect someone that you cared about very much in trying to protect them, that some people get murdered us when they feel like someone is being like someone's trying to murder someone you love. That's when people get murderous, you know? That's a common one, but I'm saying my point is being like a street, I promise the situations

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       where on the world star hip hop videos where guys are getting face punted, I promise they weren't. It wasn't calling for that. Yeah. You most likely punting a guy who was already unconscious, seen a few of them where it's people just being drunk. Idiots laughing, laughing or talking shit or starting a fight when they were too drunk and they got knocked out and then once they were out everybody just started taking free shots at him. Did you oversee that? It's literally the worst people in the world quite possibly. And I think you would agree, especially someone who's trained in martial arts, so use what you have and have you ever seen that video of the God, the weird homeless black guy who's crazy and he goes into the karate studio? Yeah. And they kill them and they. I don't know if he's dead, but that was supposedly what happened was he died, mean the noise he's making after that access and what's, what's ridiculous about it.

Speaker 3:          00:39:23       It was such a, a cock wagging because the reason that guy went so far is because when he was trying to like do a show off, like Oh, let me stand up and fight this guy. And like, you know, shut him up. He wasn't doing very good. The karate guy was beating his ass in this fight. Like that is weird. I was actually like giving them a hard time to some degree. Guy Knew how to fight a little bit, you know? The other guy knew how to fight a little bit. The guy got killed. Yeah, he definitely thinks, oh really? Yeah, enough that he had been in fights before, you know, he wasn't totally helpless. The guy beat the shit out of him, but you were right in the beginning. He wasn't getting the best out of it. Yeah. I think the guy had probably mean he must have had some street fighting.

Speaker 3:          00:40:01       It was also crazy. He's crazy. But the guy, the guy thought he was going to go kind of like knock them around a bit and make them look stupid, but it was taking them long. We should snope stack because I don't even know if that's true. Uh, you know, man kills man and Kerr. Homeless man in Karate Academy now feel racist for assuming he's homeless. I don't know if that was the story. Always was guys black and crazy. It's probably homeless in Karate Academy. Snopes. Let's see. Karate instructor on official Dot Com. Murder of mentally challenged, man. Yeah. It seems like it really happened man. But I mean those face stomps, like what kind of human being does that Kinda gotten the kind of guy who gets a buzz cut and grows a mustache and he works in a karate school. Do you know what I mean? Like that guy seems like, not that you can't be crazy and be all those things but doesn't seem like it goes a little put together. Well, the guy who was the main guy was a marine. He's a karate instructor and uh, he let his, uh, his student who fought this guy and the student allegedly actually killed this guy is the real, the real life Cobra Pies for federal real evil karate teacher. Yeah. But there's a thing, man, that people do. Um, there's a video, Brian, if you want to pull it up. Well actually we probably shouldn't see someone getting killed right up. I mean it's online, but it's

Speaker 4:          00:41:34       really, it's, it's a tough one to watch even. Well that's a, he was up for assault in the 18th of the month on an unregulated charge. Wow. So I don't know what the fuck I'm thinking if it's true. You think with that kind of evidence, should that guy die? Okay. This is stupid man. They don't know what the fuck they're talking about. Hold on a second. This is one of the things it says sources in the medical and law enforcement community. The tech community tell us that indeed the victim must have died. The snoring at the end, a so called agonal, agonal breathing and assign have massive brain damage and impending death. That's just not true. It isn't true. When you get knocked out, you snore. That's whoever said that has never seen someone get knocked the fuck out. When people get knocked out, they have that horrible snoring.

Speaker 4:          00:42:20       It happens all the time. That's really scary. Shit. Scary Shit. First Time I saw it, I was 16. I saw so many laid out just it doesn't mean they're going to die. That's not true at all. So whoever wrote the store, I don't believe him. This guy should come out and do a show before. Just comes to you as like a diagonal face to face or just get the foot footprint. It's still, it's all. I'm a VIP. There's a video of it and there's all these stories of it, but none of them substantiate any like legal stuff. I guess you'd have to look into it deep enough, but apparently this shit was a long time ago. It looked like it was a long time based on the theory that if he did die, do you think that guy deserves to die? The guy who did it, the guy who died deserves to die early, go killed the guy killed them.

Speaker 4:          00:43:07       Well, with that kind of evidence, like it's clearly from that. It's clear that they were fighting. I don't know what the conversation was that lead that guy to be fighting that guy. I don't know if he said, I'm going to come in and fight to the death. I don't know what I'm saying. You know what I'm saying? It didn't seem like that kind of a dark underground like cooma taste situations place in Des Moines, Iowa. It was a think it was in somewhere in Georgia, but anyway, the guy was a schizophrenic, so it really doesn't matter what he said. He's crazy. I mean that's what happened in Virginia. December 13th, 1984 and he's obviously crazy. That's the thing. He walks in, you're like, this guy's a. and you could have, you see that guy literally also could have hugged him and that would have ended the situation.

Speaker 4:          00:43:51       You know what I mean? There's the thing that happens in martial arts schools though, where if you're running a martial arts school, crazy people will show up and they'll start like, they'll start shit. I've seen it. I've seen it firsthand. I've seen it at my taekwondo school. He would mind, my instructor would take guys like that, that would come into schools and he would make them spar with black belts and put them just like, you know, he go, okay, so you have to fight you a pretty good guy, right? Uh, we're gonna do some sparring here. Okay. Um, you have your gear, we have gift for you. Do you have you again? And he would like lower these guys in because they would come to school and they would go, you all false master, you all false master. You don't truly know martial arts. And you know, they try to reason them.

Speaker 4:          00:44:31       Listen sir, you know, you can, uh, was the Blue Tang clan class, but you can't yell things out like people. There's people that will come in that have real mental issues and they can be dangerous. You know, they also could be martial arts trained too. There's a lot of people that just learned how to throw kicks and punches from friends. Like like if you teach an athletic person how to deliver a good straight punch and just show them the mechanics of it and they practice on a heavy bag, they'll can fuck you up if they hit. You don't really have to be really well trained and disciplined and so there's a lot of people that have martial arts abilities like the ability to punch you really hard in the face, but they don't really know how to fight. They don't. They've never been formally trained, but they might charge you and punch you in the face and they can be really dangerous.

Speaker 4:          00:45:14       So if you're in a sort of a scenario like that, a lot of times these martial arts instructors are forced to defend themselves against these crazy people. That didn't seem like that didn't seem like that in this video and this video, it seemed like they lured the guy in, set them up, beat the shit out of him to. The saddest part is at one point during like when they're just kind of like, it almost seems like slap boxing. The homeless guy stops me. He goes, your good, your good. Yeah. It's kind of a fucked up video. Any. And he does. He starts saying don't stop. At one point he does tell him to stop and then it just stopped and spit on him while he's down. It's gross. I don't know if the guy died, but if the guy did die. Yeah, that's basically murder.

Speaker 4:          00:45:56       I mean it's like perfect example. What we said is where would that murderous rage come out? Would it come out if someone was trying to kill your mom, you probably would probably would come out, but this guy wasn't in that scenario. This guy was like, the guy was saying don't like he was saying stop. He'd given up like a healthy person backs away at that point. It's like it's merciless. It's just complete like drilling. I think I was so offended somehow, but I wonder if they just got away with shit like that and this was the only one that people saw. Like a wonder if this had happened more than once because like if a guy's willing to be the guy to death like that and then dispose of a body and this is the only piece of evidence that some schizophrenia guy was murdered like that.

Speaker 4:          00:46:38       Motherfuckers probably killed a bunch of people before and he's a marine. That's the other thing. We don't know what kind of action he saw. You know, if you, if you have, you know, you're serving your country and you're used to killing people on a regular basis, then you come back home and some fucking crazy skitzo guy wants to come into karate school and talk shit. Yeah, you'll get a guy killed him. Like why not? You've been telling people for years in the eighties. That was like how they yell. Previewed like karate schools. Like how many homeless guys if you killed three homeless guys and counting. I was a part of many challenge matches where people showed up at the school and then I got to watch them fight friends. I, I fought dudes that just showed up at the school. That was a super common thing, but you can more or less with that. Well, we took them to deliver a couple. Really? Oh yeah. We took a lot of those guys to the hospital. After we beat them up, we'd bring them to the hospital after they spark, but easily could have happened

Speaker 1:          00:47:29       to me. I mean I was good, but there's a lot of good guys that came into. There were guys that had, they had talent.

Speaker 5:          00:47:37       There's a lot of fight where you put on gloves.

Speaker 1:          00:47:39       Depends. Depends on what they said. A lot of it was bare knuckle. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Because you, you never know like what they wanted to prove. You know what is.

Speaker 5:          00:47:50       I've never, and I've never been good at it. Even back in school when it was the meet me at the library, I'd throw a punch then. See I say that because I was like, let's say if I got to think about till three, I probably won't show. Like I'll probably chicken out like later. Like I'm angry now. Let's just do it. Let's get into it. That's probably the

Speaker 1:          00:48:07       best way to get everything broken up and keep it from being like something that no teachers or adults know about. The problem is if you go on a field, meet me in the field and it's like children,

Speaker 5:          00:48:18       someone can get killed. Yeah. The Lord of the flies. I had to do that a few times. It's with bullies and it always sucked, but always it turned out me beating them up. So it was great. What kind of bullies did you beat up? High. One was all girl. One is now a one is now a cop and the other guy thinks is dead. Most of them, most of the guys who talk the most shit though, just never had to really be with somebody like stepping up to it. Yeah. When you're a kid, everyone's Kinda. I mean I bought into it too. That's why I said, but whatever it was instilled in me by my dad and step up was like very much like get it going while you're angry. You know what I mean? Like don't, don't wait for it. And that's why, uh, what I was going to ask when they'd come in and they'd say like, you know, Rogan, go teach this punk or lesson, like, like what was going on, he'd

Speaker 1:          00:49:01       get nervous as fuck. But the idea behind it was my instructor was training a bunch of people for National Tournament's. So the idea was like, these guys can hang with you, you're a national level competitor and this is a good thing to experience because it's very dangerous. So you're going to be able to, you're going to have to perform under some very real pressure, like people just swinging at your face and you know, you're, you're dancing around inside this closed area looking to knock each other out. And it happened a lot. It happened, I mean, not a lot, but it happened every three, four months over the course of like seven years that I was there, every three or four months, some guy from another school would come into town and would want to show people up. We'd like, you want to show everybody how much better his style was and people would duke it out.

Speaker 1:          00:49:42       It was, it was crazy. When you stop and think about it, this is all pre UFC and there was a lot of delusional people too. There was a lot of people that thought their martial art literally could not be beaten, but they did a certain type of wing Chung and if they could go to a taekwondo school and spa, they would just run through people. That would be no way they could stop them. Did you get half off your monthly dues if he won the fight? I didn't. I didn't pay after a certain amount of time. I taught so three homeless people. Even when I was a kid, I started out when I was really young. I was like, when I was 15 I was completely dedicated and I was there every day so they would give me things to do. They would give me like a clean things or teach classes. I taught a lot of private lessons, like the people that are first starting out, you have to learn in a private lesson for them and since I advanced

Speaker 5:          00:50:28       really quickly and I'd spent so much time there, I was pretty good at breaking down the technical aspects of like certain moves. You know, it's funny and pardon the, the hand job here, but I think you're a fantastic comedian. Super funny and you have such the origin story of a guy who would not be good, but yet I know a few people like that to have people that are very like strict and life about certain things. Mike Vecchione hilarious comedian standing is like a very like regimented guy. Grew up football. He was good at it. He excelled wrestling. Went to Penn state wrestling there, you know, and then but hilarious comedian, but it usually, it doesn't breed the funny guy. Yeah. I think the introvert or the or the, you know, the weird kind of like social awkward guy or the class clown type goes onto that.

Speaker 5:          00:51:13       But it's usually someone, someone's like a strict, like, you know, usually that story becomes like, you know, I have four kids, they all wear dockers and fucking sweaters. No one says fucking, but I'm not like a, I'm not strict. I just get into things. I'm just very motivated. Like I'm a more like, I wouldn't say I'm disciplined as much as I get more obsessed, you know, discipline and things that I'm obsessed about. But I'm not like a strict person. And then the other way, like I'm not, I'm just saying usually the comics who like a guy who's in shape and doing comedy and like cares about that and cares about his health just tends to not always be. It's usually a guy, it's like, you know, some fucking, some pig the other day, you know, this fat broad because you know, at 165 pounds you slob, you know, just being like that.

Speaker 5:          00:51:59       And you're like, who's relating to this? Right. And you definitely transcend that. But I mean that's what I'm saying. It's weird that a, I don't think that always happens. I think it's more of an odd thing. I think for the God's sake, you know, so I was getting, it's when all, all of your um, like flaws kind of become your virtues and comedy, you know, so the narrowed who got beat up and now he's telling us stories about getting beaten up and now girls will fuck them because he knows how to tell a funny. Do you know what I mean? That's usually the origin story. Yeah. But it doesn't have to be. So that's the cool thing about comedy is there's so many versions, you know, like black guys have always had that thing where they're allowed to dress up really cool on stage where gold chains and crazy leather outfits like remember Eddie Murphy and yet lyricists and.

Speaker 5:          00:52:40       But it's the entire difference of black comedy and white comedy if you're gonna take by those circuits. I said there's definitely comics that bridge both worlds, but the difference in is like white mainstream comedy is very self deprecating. You know, it's like my little Dick fat guy, bald, whatever it is. And black is rare. Like, so I'm slinging the Dick, right? And it's just like, I mean fucking a stool at a black comedy club is probably owed a lot of money in civil court to just like been fucked here just off the side stages. There's a bunch of like broken up stools from a, from gang rapings. I mean there's so like. But when I would watch, I grew up like a big fan of comedy and watching like one that in the eighties and I would watch two

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       to getting to where def jam became the thing. I loved all that too. I just didn't even know. I almost didn't even notice the difference that comedy taken a turn. So like you know, how good yard [inaudible] and how big your Dick is. Well it's comedy can be anything, man. It's just got to be funny. That's what people don't understand. Like if anybody wants to say that. Like I've heard people say this, this is like a social justice warrior thing. They say that real comedy always punches up meaning like get it, get at the bad person that's above you, dominating you. The boss, the president pushes up and you know, you don't pick on any people that are below you, but the reality is sometimes punching down it's fucking hilarious. Sure. It's not, it's not always, but it's about what is the subject matter, like what it like.

Speaker 3:          00:54:13       You could like, I remember Louis Ck doing a bit about how his kid is a fucking asshole. Sure. And it was really fucking funny because first of all, you knew he wasn't serious. It was. I mean he was talking about his kid, like in a frustrated way about a kid. Just being a kid. I'm sure he loves his kid. Like he loves life itself, but because he's, he's punching down, he's making. He's like shitting on his kid for being an asshole. Sure, sure. And it's hilarious. It's like there's no rules, there's no rules like a guy has to be self deprecating. The guy saying, so I'm slinging that Dick, right? I'm given that deck. You know when you give, giving that good tick and you feel that as whole reverberating off your ball sack every time you come down home with little loop the loop, you can be crying, laughing, listening to that, crying, laughing or you could be crying, laughing, listening to a guy who talks about it.

Speaker 3:          00:55:01       We can never get laid. The variable in those things is just, is it funny or is it not funny? That's the important variable. We. Me and my buddy washed nick Nikennon special. You want to have fun man. Get stoned and just watching nick cannon special. It's just if you like. I love watching just ridiculously horrible comedy. It's my favorite thing in the world. Good and just watching the Canon by an hour of television so he can slowly but surely peel down from a Tuxedo to a tank top is one of the first week as a backdrop. That's just a million light bulbs, so when he moves it's going to give you a fucking seizure. And his jokes, we're all like, you know, you meet a girl up in a club and you're all like splatoon just noises. And then apparently Brian, Gary was texting that night, like live tweeting or whatever, but she goes, I told you my baby was funny.

Speaker 3:          00:55:55       Oh my God, I love that. If you want to watch a show that just bring joy to your life. Have you ever heard of Bill Bellamy's who got jokes? Oh, well, just take a weekend and really dig into it because it's A. I don't think I have it in me. It's a comedy. Yeah. You don't like watching bad comedy? No. This is. It's on tv one, which is a black TV network. I didn't know that existed. Yeah, it's called TV One and Bill Bellamy hosted a isn't on top. No, it's done now I think to Tommy from Martin, but it airs on marathons, on this network. Tommy from Martin is the column, the Pope of comedy. He sits on the throne and judges as three comics come out and they do. The first round is just, they're set in front of an audience and there's three people from the audience picked at random to be the judges where they give a score from one to five, five being the best, one being the worst.

Speaker 3:          00:56:53       Everyone gets a five. And if you give someone a for the audience loses their shit, they get very mad at you. That's around one. The comedy is always got awful. And then, uh, it unprepared, usually it looks like the, these guys, another we're going to do a TV show that day and uh, and then round two, they come out and they do some kind of challenge that you don't under which they have a heckler in the audience or somebody comes out like actually actually a producer and hit you in the face with a pie and you got to keep going. And then they judge you score from one to five and it's just horrible, horrible comedy. But it makes me laugh. Like, why does that make you laugh? Just because it works. I'm amazed by I'm very interested and that there's actually a science to comedy.

Speaker 3:          00:57:40       Don't you find that interesting? There's like actual science, so you could just say the right words. Have you ever seen a comedy hypnotist now? Never seen one of those guys. Dude, you got to see a comedy hypnotist. If you get a chance, a real ones, I just assume it's fake. You know, not fake at all. There's something that really stupid people are susceptible to that you're not susceptible to. There's someone can like say some things to you onstage, snap their finger and some people literally go into a trance. Sure they can do it. Those people will laugh at anything to they're dumb as fuck to. I think what the reality of this world is that there's people that are. Their brains don't work so good, they just don't, and there's not a goddamn thing you can do about it. It's not about education. It's not about how much information you give them.

Speaker 3:          00:58:28       It's not about the environment they're in. They have nine volt brains. No, I know. And like the funniest to give the audience. The audience has never communally stood up to someone who was like, that's hacky. Like the audience never says that. It's always being judged by other comments. Say this is in general, like when there's a hacky comic on stage, usually he's destroying it depends on where you're at, right? I mean if you're in la or New York, those guys could he beat and shit possibly. But forums like this where comics and people get to talk and like there's so much insight information out now. I think it kind of weeds through that happened and now I think the audiences are a little smarter in some circles, but they have to be fans. Like if you. Do you remember going to see comedy when you first started to like go to open mic nights. See guys that you thought were really funny and then like a year later you fucking couldn't even be in the room and they're on stage. Oh, I mean the people I worshiped when I started, I was like, just the way he kills, you know, like I got

Speaker 5:          00:59:21       to do a joke where I open up and say dj put that shit on one more time because everyone had to have one of those. I used to get down to the underwear on stage, used to get down to my underwear posing to the 2001 theme. Oh God. And then one day no one left. I didn't do ever again. I went to see this guy when I was in a.

Speaker 1:          00:59:41       When I was in Boston before I did stand up, I went to see this, a comedy at a play it again, Sam's. It was like this movie house that had stand up in the basement and this guy did these like fake adlibs and I knew they were fake while it's happening. I didn't understand comedy be but he pointed to me and he goes, and this guy is over here saying this, but I didn't say anything. I don't remember what it was, but I remember like, he's like, what? I couldn't believe that he was pretending that there was some sort of a weird interaction. We asked for the rest of the audience and so I realized that this guy was just bullshitting and this is kind of this fake dance. And then as I got to know him, I kept seeing them over and over and over again. He was doing the same thing. Every time he would, he would set this bit up, he would point to a guy in the audience and he's like this. He would say the same thing. Like he never, he had his fake adlibs with the crowd. There was no variation. So if you saw him more than once the act was done like the, the, the, the veil had been lifted.

Speaker 5:          01:00:37       It doesn't bring any joy to watch. Like that level of shitty comedy like happened. No, it makes me sad. It makes me laugh. So I, I used to any show when it comes, I just can't believe nothing when you watch somebody either on television and their first joke is, now I know what you guys are thinking. Actually, I had a guy open for me one time on the road where, uh, he had a joke. I forget what it even was it about, but whatever it was, the crowd never laughed in the middle of it. And he goes, uh, so my family used to run a funeral home. He goes, now you guys laugh. But he goes into his job, but no one, no one laughed at that. But every time he goes, now you guys laugh. But I had never. That's always funny. The now, uh, I know what you're thinking, you see me and I'm like, it happens a lot.

Speaker 5:          01:01:23       People like it. I feel you should never, and a lot of us do, but you should never get on television with your first ever set, you know, when you go on, when you go on the road and me, you know, as a, uh, when I, when I go on the road and someone opens for me, I'm generally getting somebody doing their first set. You remember that. Like when every time he got on stage it was the introduction. So my name is Jay and I blah, blah blah, you know, it's like first day girl comedy. So I'm so and so and I'm a total slot and I sex with my friends and it's just like that. But that first set makes it on tv a lot. Now [inaudible], there's so many forums. Yeah, but that's just life. You just kind of move on,

Speaker 1:          01:01:59       just deal with it. It's probably not good to have your first set, but if you've been doing standup for 10 years or whatever it is, when you get your first set on tv, six years just fuckin accepted sucks except that it sucks and move on, you know, and you won't know. It sucks until you see it. You gotta watch it on TV like later in your career when you're better and you'd go.

Speaker 4:          01:02:18       But yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm saying I'm surprised that the behind the scenes don't catch up to like, like to see like there's no like, uh, they don't take any cues from the actual community of comedy itself. Do you know what I mean? They're like, this guy's been doing comedy for five months. Like of course he should be on letterman. You know what I mean? The behind the scenes, people know they're always looking for someone to come along to prodigy. That figures it out after four months. So weird. But I don't know if they do that person any favors though. They definitely don't. They don't give a fuck though. All they care about is what can they sell. Just like the reality show, as I, if you've noticed, if you've watched the video of moved into a new chair, ladies and gentlemen, I don't know if this one's going to make it and I don't know, but the other thing is better than no back things better.

Speaker 4:          01:02:57       Um, but it's, you know, they just sell you, you know? Sure. If they can sell the hook is you Olympians in Stanford, five months, they're not going to protect you. They're not going to go up that big Jay. He's got potential for the future. Let's not put it. Five month old comedy set. No the fuck you get on TV. Who gives a shit sink or swim as many more people they have to pay attention to. They don't give a fuck. I'll look. I'm sure the fucking. What's it? The hunger games. People were pretty thrilled that j dot snatches out there. That's huge for them. Just drew a whole new audience to that show because I don't know how those two are connected, but we're talking about someone being hacked now. Someone who was talking about. I thought you were saying about selling things like the company. I was saying that companies that don't care, like the movie companies don't care that she gets like exposed.

Speaker 4:          01:03:42       You know what I mean? Is it does give them a good job. They don't protect her. I'm saying they don't. They don't come out. They would have protected her. I'm sure they probably wouldn't have let it be released but it. But it's to their benefit now that it is. I kind of guess so. Yeah. But it's a different thing than I had in my mind. I was like, did it have nothing to do with it? I'm like, no. There was a connection in my mind. There was something there I guess. I guess I've only seen the first one now I want to watch more after seeing her naked. Right. Which is good for the company. So the movie company, even though it's like they pay her and she's like, you know, she has a relationship with them. They don't give a fuck if something to her detriment builds up their movie.

Speaker 4:          01:04:19       Yeah, I could see that probably. Yeah, probably after it's over there, like they probably would have protected her from getting out. But once it's out like hey look, in the long run we're going to do bro. She looks great. Sat around the office and yeah, it's true being the only way you're ever going to get protected as a comic because if you have a manager and the manager will say, listen Jane, you know, let's keep hitting the clubs and you know, wait a year, wait, wait a couple of years, we'll just work. Where's that manager? Jeff Salzman. Yeah, my guy. Yeah, it's hard. You've got to develop comedians. Like you got to treat them as like a longterm project. You can't like move people into a house before you can put a roof on it and he can't pretend it's done. What's not done. And when you see a young guy that's got potential, I mean everybody that we've ever met, they go through periods like you were talking about your black comedy period. Sure. You know, people go through these weird phases where they're trying to find themselves as, I hate to use the word, but artists find myself as an artist

Speaker 5:          01:05:18       man. And uh, but the thing is if there's a video of you have five months in and then it's terrible, but there's a way better video two years later. Well, if someone watches both, they go out. Jay got better, you know, it's just, there's nothing wrong. Oh, I did bet. Comicview thrice three times. Really? Yeah. So I mean, like who was hosting the first one ever was lester barry who was a black circuit comic for the very religious. Nice. The second time I did it was Arnez J in Miami. And the third time third time was funny because I said by this point I go, I'm not doing comic view ever again. Like I just, I've written that one off, I'm not doing it. It's always an awkward situation when I go there too. Why? Because I'm the only white guy, the production is white and they put some weird responsibility on me to be like the den mother of the comics, so I've like smoked cigarettes and I'd go outside, I'm going to go outside and smoke a cigarette.

Speaker 5:          01:06:13       She goes, okay, wait a second. He was everyone Jay's going to smoke if you want to smoke, go out now with him and everyone's got to be back in here in 15 minutes. And then she tried to get me all of their food tickets so I'd be responsible for them. It was very bizarre. Just because you're white. Yeah, I mean I assume so. That said, a lot of the black comics will do things like I'm going to go out and smoke and then go like, you know, fuck a chick for five hours trying to cut back 15 minutes before the show starts. So that did happen. Well, what they want you to do is just hang out all day waiting for the show to start. Oh, they put you there at nine in the morning until night. I went on at midnight. What? Yeah, because they just don't want this wrangle. Everybody acts. They don't believe anyone.

Speaker 5:          01:06:53       No, no belief. They're going to stay there. They've done entire shows about how happy they are. Like they'll do a show where the same joke gets repeated by different comedians. Well yeah, and so I went and did it. Kevin Hart ended up hosting I think one of the last ever seasons, but it was called one mic stand and where something like that I think is what it's called, one mic stand, but it wasn't called comic view and Kevin called me and asked me if I wanted to do it or if I would do it. And I said, yeah, but I don't want to do comic view anymore. He goes, it's not comic view. It's different. They're flying people out now. They're doing it all right. And set it up good. And it was a. When I signed the contract, gets comic presents, one mic stand. They gave us a big speech before we taped anything and the guy was like, we're changing comic fuel.

Speaker 5:          01:07:37       It's going to be different. And the guys specifically said no more stool humping and dj hit it and pulling out fake teeth. And uh, I mean we weren't three comics in before the guy was wearing fake teeth and fucking a stool. I mean not even by the way, when he's giving this speech to it, these same guys who were getting ready to fuck stools and put in fake teeth are doing like, you know, like staring at him, give the speech and like nodding their heads like a Pachino speech in any given Sunday. It's like an emotional, powerful speech. How we're changing comic view now. And then they went and they were like, yeah, let's go out there and show the world something. And then two minutes later you're like, Dj put that Shit back on that bitch with fake teeth to this one was black surrogates made for some great, great, great stories.

Speaker 5:          01:08:27       I had a guy one time, this is true story. Kevin used to host a club in Atlantic city, Kevin Hart called sweet cheeks, sweet, violent. It was like a pimps and players ball. No bullshit. It was like everyone was wearing zoot suits and shit. And bringing like three chicks a piece and they were all dressed up fancy, but they interrupt dancing to do a comedy show in the middle of the fucking night. Like two, 3:00 in the morning. Yeah. And I, I was hosting at one time for Kev, you couldn't do it. And they hated me. They absolutely didn't like me at all and I was going to bring the comic on stage and I go like, all right, but I'm gonna bring up next to go what's your name? And he goes, uh, ignorant Nigga. And I was like, dude, don't make me say that please.

Speaker 5:          01:09:13       And he's like, that's my name as my stage name. And I kept, I begged him to let me call him by his regular name and I go, it's not going to go good if I said. He goes, it's fine man. I'll explain. It's my name. You know, he set you up? Yeah. When are you going on stage? He goes, you're going to let that white boy call me. And I left. I just left the show. I drove off. Yeah. That was like, it was a dangerous place. The bouncer outside was a bounty hunter also, so he would run ids. Everybody that walked in, he'd get five people in light on warrants. Wow, that's crazy. He was a bounty hunter and an ID checker. Yeah. That's like fishing in a fucking swimming pool. That's so not fair. That seems like a deer in a stock pond.

Speaker 5:          01:09:55       You know what I mean? It just seems really fucked up a night club and it was just like an a pimps and players nightclub. Yeah, they threw the chicken wings at me one time. Wow. It was a. and I think I. Yeah, I think I was doing that joke where I was getting down to my underwear. Who the fuck wants them to do comedy at 2:00 in the morning and a place where they have dancing. They do. I used to do these ski trips shows that were like black ski trips and black people don't even ski at all. They don't. They go and they, they took a bus thing to go to this hotel and they'd all just like, fuck each other fucking drink, you know, green alcohol and a green alcohol, just like Tang arrays and the drinks were always great. Like thug passion streaks.

Speaker 5:          01:10:41       Yeah. And I go up there and open someone's already headline for these black ski trips and they just fucking hated it. Wanted no parts of the comedy show. I never understand why they force comedy into places where it doesn't need to be at all. Well, people make money, you know, I'm sure Kevin Hart got a nice piece by navy, I mean was, he was very young. We were like brand new in comedy, but I mean if somebody offers it and you're like, yeah, we can do a show there. Fuck it. Yeah. I mean the bar shows that New York that's become such a thing. Bar shows are shows and I go to them with this, you know, this expectation. What blows my mind about I think bar shows or a cool thing to have as far as like open mics. Basically. Little produce shows you can get people on, but like I'll hear my friends, you know, or younger comics who I know and I'll be like, where are you at tonight?

Speaker 5:          01:11:28       And he goes, so and so I go, oh, well do this other thing with me. Like don't go to that bullshit bar show. And it's like, I've been booked this for three months. Like whoa. Yeah, they call you. It's like you want to do my bar show it's batch when it sees bet 25 people, uh, you know, he's getting a drink ticket or half price off drinks and it's on Tuesday at 9:00 PM, somewhere in nowhere fucking Brooklyn. And then it's like, oh yeah, I guess I can do it. And it's like, you know, okay. So I'm looking at like, I have my book open here, like December, like May, like they really booked this things far out. Is that just because there's so many comics in New York? It is. I think it's a lot of it becomes like people just getting their friends on his ship probably find the gas because he's, a lot of these shows have become like legit to some degree.

Speaker 1:          01:12:07       Well if it's a good show, well run. It's very valuable to comedians. Sure. I gave you, you know, you go to Wednesday night comedy juice, the Improv, so he's going to be packed. It's a great place to work out material. Like that becomes the. Yeah. But you know what I'm saying? Sure. So shows like that become valuable and then little side gigs like was a place you were talking about three clubs and what does it mean?

Speaker 2:          01:12:27       Clubs? Yeah, I mean like all these kinds of bars says. But the like with the old red rocks has one now that's, that's like in the corner. But the problem is New York is like a billion times more bar shows in la. So like all the local comics in La, they will get that one shitty bar show, but it's like, yeah, it's like a month away when they get it.

Speaker 1:          01:12:46       Like how many rooms are there all told in New York? If you had to guests, you live in Manhattan. Yeah. How many rooms do you think comedy standup rooms or in the,

Speaker 5:          01:12:54       in the actual clubs, we could run through them. Really a stay at New York comic strip seller, seller, Gotham, Gotham, the stand stand. Um, Caroline's Caroline's. Then there's a Greenwich Village Comedy Club, New York Comedy Club, Broadway Comedy Club, New York comedy clubs. Still around. Just bought my new guy danger fields who are 10. Um, there is a lol comedy club in Times Square.

Speaker 1:          01:13:22       Lol. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:13:24       And then there's like places there's like, and then like some room show there every week times square, lol, lol, lol. I'm good dude. I'm not fucking with them. Uh, 11 were at 11 and then there's. And then there's like, oh, Eastville comedy club 13. I think. Yeah, I mean it's really, it's pretty nuts. Yeah. So that's the major clubs. It's really awesome. Did we say God didn't take them?

Speaker 1:          01:13:53       So that's, uh, that's the major clubs. Yeah. And then on top of that you got how many bar shows? Yeah. Do you

Speaker 5:          01:13:58       think in the city or around the. Even the boroughs in the city? Just in the city, just in Manhattan, I mean there's got to be fucking 10 a night fight against at least. At least. That's crazy. It's also like the people

Speaker 2:          01:14:12       that live in New York and go to New York, there are more into like plays and live performances that I think like the west coast is.

Speaker 1:          01:14:18       Well, if you're a young person or any person who's got free time at night and you're looking for some entertainment, it's one of the best place in the world and go, you can go to the seller. If you can go to caroline's and you can see live comedy in New York every night of the week. You can see killers. You could see, you know, a pto and ck and all these different people show up at clubs. I mean, it's one of the best places in the world to go out and see live comedy. Oh, New York. Yeah. Fantastic. Just to go out. I mean, that's what people, if they've never been in New York before, they're like, there's so many restaurants and somebody. This is somebody that it's fucking mad scene. I drove by the laugh factory last night out here and it was like the line was like wrapped around the building.

Speaker 1:          01:14:57       That's Jamie doesn't let people in. He wants that line to be wrapped around the building. He doesn't just like let people in. He makes you stay outside so it looks like a line out there. We're signing up for tomorrow. Those a lot of them was like the open mic nights, like they have to open mic nights. They make people sit out there from 9:00 in the morning, whatever the fuck the sign up time is and they have to wait in line until they get picked and then they go on next week. They don't even go on that week. The wait in line all day and they go on the next week. Why exactly. We've been. We've been rallying against this next time I a control. Exactly. It's a ridiculous idea that he has that in doing so he makes the club more special because it was always a big line. It's tough to get in,

Speaker 5:          01:15:39       put your thumb on people that could eventually like, you know, like say like, this is my home, this is the club that showed me the love. Like why? Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:15:46       I never got that. That same evil shit that makes producers put someone on a reality show and then try to own everything about them for the next 10 years or whatever the fuck it is. It's the same thing. It's like greedy thing that people do out here, this weird, creepy fucking behavior where the people that are coming up, I'm not respected as potential equals and if they do somehow another make it through. It's never through their own merit. It's because of the good nature and your, you know, your generosity. That's led them to this position of being a good a showbiz person.

Speaker 2:          01:16:20       I find it weird with any comedy club that doesn't have comics hanging out at it and like they want people to hang out like comp comedians to hang out like that place. The laugh factory. That's the one thing that I've always heard is like, no, they don't let you hang out there. There's one getting to hang out there, it's there. I know. I think that that's only to a certain group of, you know, the big guys, but the average comic is what that always tells me that

Speaker 5:          01:16:45       I did a club on the road one time where there was a young comics hanging out. So I was like, uh, I talked to them for a little while and I was like, you know, if you guys want to go on like, you know, you can put you guys on each one do like seven minutes or something, go for it. And they told me and I confirmed with the club that they go, Oh, now the club doesn't do guest spots at all. Like at all. I got thought it's kind of up to the isn't up to like the headliner if he like, doesn't care, like it was fine. They go now that's

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       just like our policy don't do it. I go and I told him when I talked to the manager guy, I was like, why would you discourage comics from hanging out? It's very like, you know what I mean? It doesn't make, it's not a friendly environment. Well Wendy Curtis, you know, it's kind of things you work those shitty open mic show. So eventually maybe they'll give you a shot at like hosting a weekend or you know, doing something like that guest spots. Do you know Wendy from comedy works in Denver? I know who she is. Yeah. She, uh, she had a great way of describing it. She goes, why would you sell widgets and not have like a widget development team? Like why wouldn't you, if you want to sell other people's widgets, you can make your own inhouse widgets. Like what are you doing when you're running a comedy club?

Speaker 3:          01:17:49       You're not develop any local talent. You don't develop any of it. Like it's one of the things like they were moving improv's into town and she was saying like, what are you guys going to do for like developing local talent? And they're like, nothing. She was like, what? Like that's alien. Like she's developed a bunch of comedians out of that club and she has like a whole system of taking people from MCS to relax to headliners. Like it's really well thought out, really like conscientious system of helping these artists, you know, sometimes they have their babies, but when people come to New York yet it's always a two coin flip. If someone's like what city? You're from Miami. Like, oh, what was your home club like? Oh, the owner. There was a piece of shit. Treat me like an asshole. Would you say about babies? Some of them are babies, no.

Speaker 3:          01:18:32       What'd you say? Should I say babies? But I don't know. Because you were saying that people complain about the sale when someone comes to the to like move to New York from their home club, you know, where they started. It's a coin flip. Whether they're going to say it was a great experience. So you know, they're very supportive of them. They get behind some people, the local clubs and then some they just like, there's such shitty people, but I never understand being shitty to like local town. This is crazy. People in clubs, you know, crazy people on dance clubs, crazy people tends to be a certain personality type here. You've got to be a hardcore motherfucker to own a bar, you know, and to own a comedy club and just want to deal with comedians all the time. You got to be either someone who loves comedy or an insane person.

Speaker 3:          01:19:12       Do you get frustrated when, uh, when people that are around comedy enough, even if it doesn't make sense in their life, they're like, I'm going to try and they started doing open mics or do you like, go for it? What do you mean? Do you get like, I know this club owners in New York, even that just fucking start doing comedy after owning the club for like three years, where like, I'm doing it, I'm going to give it a shot. But who knows, maybe there'll be good. They hired bookers and the booker start trying to do Qa. It's like very weird. Well, eleanor, eleanor Kerrigan, she was a waitress at the comedy store forever. I knew her as a waitress for more than 10 years now. She's a real professional comic. She started like many, many years in because she had no around comedy. No thought about doing it ever? Nope. Nope. Just got, get another job. One day actress. She was an actress. She did a lot of acting. She was in wrestling. She did some pro wrestling and then somewhere along the line she just decided, fuck it, I'm going to go on stage. And she started doing standup. Yeah, I mean now she's a pro. She's

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       funny. I mean it's crazy. I mean she's smart so she understands like what's funny and what's not funny. She knows what's happening and what's not. So she didn't fall in any pitfalls.

Speaker 5:          01:20:15       Maybe I feel the ego stroke because I feel like when it's done, like uh, the current Metzker, you know, Kurt Kurt's never had a girlfriend that has eventually been like, well, if this shit had never vocalized that, but in my mind, like if my chick was like, I want to do comedy, I'm like, what do you think? It's like super simple. You think it's that easy. You just go with like, you know what? I'm gonna do your stupid thing. It looks a lot more fun than my stupid thing.

Speaker 1:          01:20:38       Well it's also when they're around comics, they see how fun it is and they see like how comic think and then they start thinking like comics and same ridiculous shit show if you're, if you're around chick like long enough, like she'll start seeing how you pick things apart and make sure like if you're around someone who's really funny at work, you know, and it's like I have this boss who is a private investigator. Dude was hilarious. He was just instantly hilarious. Just would find things that were goofy about people and start and you would just how with this guy. And I learned a lot like being around him, I started doing that too. Like you start seeing how he would find these patterns. Like he was very predatory, like the patterns that we find that we're fucked up and people and just attack those patterns and it's like teaching pick it up in relationships.

Speaker 1:          01:21:24       People pick it up and friendships. So you know, Kurt is a funny dude. I get these checks were probably around them and they were like, Yo, what can fucking do this? I see what's going on here. I guess you could make it look effortless maybe, but like sort of also fun, you know, I mean if fun. Sure. Not Enjoying your life and you know, not enjoying your job, but you saw a guy like you having the time of his life cracking jokes, making shit. God dammit. I think I could do that. He looks he looks way better than a regular job. If you're a person that has a regular job and then someone like big Jay comes along, you're hanging out with them and you watch and how he does it. Like this fucking guy's barely working here. Sure. He's just laughing about shit and writing it down and then figuring out a way to say it on stage in a funny way. Fuck selling insurance.

Speaker 5:          01:22:07       How many people did you grow up with, um, before comedy that genuinely happy for you? Like really feel it. What do you mean? Like do you have like friends from before comedy still and are like genuinely happy for your success and like dig. What you do is like if, if I have one friend from growing up that I'm still friends with and it's because he's the only one of my friends that is doing what he wanted to do. Also, you have to have that self security before you can like really cheap. I'd go back to philly constantly, barely any. I mean I hung out with a lot of people on it growing up. No one comes out. No one gives a shit. Really. None of them give a shit at all. Come to your shows. You mean once in a while one of them will pop up, but a lot of times they'll say they're coming and they don't show up. I mean, I stopped giving a shit years ago. I realized that all at one time because a bunch of them did come at once and afterwards they were like, good job man. So we're all going over. It's like dollar beer night at the so and so. He went ahead and I'm like, well, hang here for a few minutes to catch up and whatever. They go, the place kind of closes

Speaker 3:          01:23:06       in like an hour and you're like, alright, bye. Fuck faces. I guess like, so what did you want them to spend more time having the Dodo vary by having seen these people in a while and I was genuinely curious about what's going on with them but you didn't want to go to their spot, but I just also, they were very dismissive of the whole thing, like thanks dude. Pretty good job. It's just seemed to. Didn't seem very. Like if they would've been like, wow dude, this is a pretty extraordinary thing you're doing at any point. I'm not saying they had to say those words, but they showed that at all. It makes them have to face the fact that like, you know, he said he was going to be a pilot but he's working at a fucking gas station. Do you attribute it to jealousy or disinterest or what do you attribute it to?

Speaker 3:          01:23:44       It might be a little bit of both. Who knows, but I know when I first started doing it again, like you said, the way you did taekwondo, it's a heavy commitment, especially because I started going after the first year of just doing it in Philly, Keith Robinson grabbed me, Kurt Metzger and Kevin Hart and started taking us up to New York and I did that. I started not being able to do all the bullshit with my friends that we were doing. I wasn't part of like dollar beer night anymore, you know what I mean? Or any of that shit. So and, but when I would come back and be like, hey guys, I'm doing this cool thing, like, come check this out. They were just like, Eh, I don't care. You know what I'm saying? Oh No, I'm going to go do this, this neat show in Atlantic city or whatever the case always went live.

Speaker 3:          01:24:23       When you're growing up, there's certain people that you grow up with because they went to school with you and then with your friends and some folks evolve and develop and change and grow and some people stagnate and actually develop problems for themselves to distract themselves. Like I grew up at some kids that were really good friends and then they became like, one of them became a pill head. Like he's gone. Like I don't talk to me more. If he called me, I wouldn't call them back. You know, you could probably get ahold of me, but he's too fucked up. It's too fucked up. I know his family. I know all the disasters he's been through. Just said I'm not interested in communicating, so there's going to be people like that in your life. Have you had to circumstantial friendships in comedy? You know what I mean?

Speaker 3:          01:25:01       Like that. Just like for you, like you hung with someone for a little while and then like, I guess it really like the Rosa. Did he live with me for awhile? When he first moved to New York, when he moved out and we were tight, we were together every day. We drove in together to the city and from Queens and hung out all the time and I just don't describe being Joseph friends. Like he's my buddy for sure, but I mean I'm probably the 30th person. He would call him if he had good news and his life. You know what I mean? I'd probably hear it third hand first and we have no beef at all. When I see him, we'd love to catch up and bullshit and have a good time. But you know what I'm saying? Like it turns out the issue just you need more from him.

Speaker 3:          01:25:36       I'm just saying I need more from him. I didn't even call me too. I think he's, I think he's angry at my racism is also. Oh, that Anthony Kumi a thing of the day was just so ridiculous. He did our show and uh, I heard you on the show. Went on this long thing that was very jilted lover ish in a lot of ways about Kumi not calling. I'm like, fine, it's just call him because I mean, it also recognized that the guy's busy. No, he defended all these other people but he didn't defend me. I'm like, oh, come on man, cause he didn't like talk about you online.

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       Like you're, you're upset at them. And then there was this accusations of racism that they also didn't discuss. You know, it's like, it was, it was. So all of it could have been handled better. Watch them go on the Anthony Show. Yeah, I listened to it. I mean look how that end. It should, he should have never. You should never just written them off if a guy's your friend and he's involved in some sort of a public crisis like Anthony was, you know, first of all you have to recognize there's a tremendous amount of stress involved in any sort of physical altercation. So don't expect people to behave rationally after someone punched him. That's one. And then two, don't expect people to behave rationally after like gigantic groups of people start calling you a racist and saying, you know what you're doing by writing all the is like essentially a hate crime.

Speaker 1:          01:26:54       He got fired from your job. People Rally for you to get fired from your job. Other people rally for you to get rehired. They want other people to boycott the show and cancel Sirius xm because of that. There was a lot stress going on. The idea that he's ignoring Jojo tweets. Like fuck man. Like what? What? What version of the thing did you see? That job is a little bit selfish. Sure. Yeah. And I love Joe. He's a great guy. That's what makes joe a really funny comic, is that he obsesses on things. He thinks about things until he finds out what's really funny about them and then he figures out a way to do it onstage and figures out a way to cut it down to like a really funny joke. He's a great comic. Shouldn't that same sort of curiosity, sensibility, obsession, all those. The combination of things mixed together in a stew. You know, sometimes I could fuck with your personal life, you know, I think that's probably what happened there. You know, that if, if it was a more rational circumstance for anthony, more rational response by Joe, I think they could have had a conversation about it and work through and I think they did kind of,

Speaker 5:          01:27:52       I just don't understand how joe in any way, shape or form had a feeling where it was like this effect to him in some way. I don't know how people, I mean I had, I had a, I got tweets that were like a, you know, cancel Sirius xm standby. And I just, I just didn't. Not that I don't, I, I did. Uh, I did, uh, Anthony [inaudible] podcast after that and talk to I, I, I am, I understand why he did what he did. I think he should've done the way he did it. I think there's a better way to handle it. I think he does too. Of course he does. But I'm saying, but I just think like, I don't know, but it was just. I agree that serious fired him. I wish he didn't get fired. I wouldn't have done it myself, but I'm not blown up when they said he's fired, I wasn't like, wait, what? Like I completely understand that the fire, the shit though will rain down on them. It wasn't worth it to them. So they fired him. Yeah, I understand. It's a business call, but

Speaker 1:          01:28:40       it is kind of a business call, but it's also a business call to not do it. Like you have to decide like what, what, what helps your business giving that guy an opportunity to express himself on the show would have generated a tremendous amount of ratings, you know? Absolutely. And I think if he'd done it eloquently, which I'm sure he would've, there would've been a tremendous amount of support for keeping them on the show. I think his, his argument in his assertion about the black community has always been there's a violence problem in the black community. It's not that he's racist against all black people. What his point has always been is that there's a lot of folks that are not willing to concede that there's a violence issue and he thinks there is an issue, you know, where he and I don't know what his take on the social ramifications or the reasons for this racial issue or there's violence issue in the black community.

Speaker 1:          01:29:28       You know, I think it's an economic thing. And what I've always pointed to is the Gypsies, Gypsies, and in England and Ireland and who are constantly getting involved in crime and fighting and the bare knuckle motherfuckers and they're white. You know, those type of people. Um, the people that live in these economically challenging situations where there's a lot of bad people around them in a lot of crime and violence. That's the atmosphere you, you live in. That's the soup you fucking were born into. And the shit's hard to deal with for everybody. And I think that what he did is also a function of that form of media. Like doing things in 140 characters. You can express yourself very good in 140 characters. And if you take, even if you take something from something you said in this podcast and put it in 140 characters in quotes and put it on a tweet, it could make it look like a real piece of Shit, you know?

Speaker 5:          01:30:19       Well, but what it really was like, he just tweeted out what he should just said. Well he, you know, exact part, it's a piece of plywood or no, he should have set it on the radio. But by then he could have gotten a way to say it so eloquently. I'm talking about in that moment of fury, you need to call a friend who's going to go, I know, dude. Right? I know you're so right. And then 15 minutes later when you calm down, you go, of course I don't hit every black person. It's like he, he vented and I said, and he's such a guy who's used to preaching to the choir and he forgot that there's like regular people behind that choir that I'm going to be like, we're waiting to hear catch that. Catch them like it's way easier. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:30:58       Take your tweet and retweet it than it is to say, hey, you gotta, listen to Anthony on Sirius xm this morning when he was going off about how there's a violence problem in the black community and all the crazy shit that he screamed and yelled about. That's one thing, but to someone to just take those tweets and retweet them or take them to cut and paste them and put them in a blog completely outside of the context of who you are, what your style of communicating with has always been on the show. The style of communicating on the show has always been him screaming. She's always done that, so when he does that in a twitter form, it's par for the course. I mean that's what he does. It's just when he does it on the radio, the people that are going to be upset at that, they would have to listen to the whole thing to get to that. They would have to listen to that chunk. Someone would have to alert them to it. They'd have to like listen to it all play out. All they have to do is just hear it, see it, retweet it, see it, retweet it, see it on a blog and then a bunch of fucking outrage attached to it and all these accusations, but

Speaker 5:          01:31:53       what do you do at that point? I mean on. In your opinion, do you come out in high defense of yourself or do you just go sit back and go? My. His resume kind of speaks for itself. Like you could just look at his body of work and notes that he's clearly not a outwardly racist. I mean like that. Well, a lot of people who want to kill those people to his world or like

Speaker 1:          01:32:12       a lot of people disagree with you there. A lot of people disagree with you. That's a fact. A lot of people take a lot of the things that he said on the radio show, cut them out of context and put it up and say that these are more pieces of evidence that he's racist. I don't think he's racist. I think he's frustrated. I think that he liked a lot of people that have been involved in these types of scenarios. You only see the person's attacking you and you only see the group that they're, they're attached to and if I lived in New York and I had to deal with a lot of bullshit on a regular basis, I don't know how much bullshit he deals with, but whether it was bullshit coming from Irish people or it's bullshit coming from, you know, Asian people that are fuck with me all the time.

Speaker 1:          01:32:52       I mean if you were living in a group where there's a certain number of people from x community that are causing a lot of crimes, you're always gonna have some frustration. You're going always going to be upset about that. I don't know where his head's at. I don't, I've never had like long, like uncensored conversations with him about this. I've talked to him on the radio and I love talking to them, so I. If I had to guess, I would say no, I don't think he's racist. I think he's just not scared of speaking his mind about very controversial issues that could very easily come across cross as racism when he's describing things like very real statistics like crime statistics, like they're undeniable mean if you look at crime statistics and the amount of young African American men that are in jail, it's fucking bananas. It's bananas representative of the population as a whole. Like this small amount of people that are black and then the large amount of black guys that are in jail. You would go, okay, well is that evidence of racism? That's why they're being prosecuted, or is it evidence that they're committing far more crimes? Is it a combination of both? Is it a lack of social awareness that has allowed these inner cities to get completely out of hand and these impoverished neighborhoods the. Yeah, I think that,

Speaker 5:          01:34:02       but all the fury is just going to be that. He was like, you know, some black bitch basically, you know, just to just be so dismissive. This no one's carrying about the statistics he's throwing out. They're only focusing, but my point is you can get those facts out. If it had been a bunch of Irish people and he was like, you know, this, this mic ginger fuck just punched me, punched me in the face because he's white. He could do it, but he could do it. But then his tweets would resonate more. It wouldn't make any kind of news, but at least it would resonate more if he had some kind of facts and figures to support, you know, whatever the violence problem.

Speaker 2:          01:34:36       I find it interesting though that after all this recent shit about him being racist, that he doesn't just kinda back off and just for like a year talk about cupcakes or something. He's actually pushing it almost to the point of like, like

Speaker 5:          01:34:50       you're like is really proven

Speaker 2:          01:34:53       my speech and, and, and, and everything like that. He's almost to make a point about, you know,

Speaker 3:          01:34:59       what, what do you, what are the examples you're talking about?

Speaker 2:          01:35:01       Well, like, you know, after all this thing of him being racist on twitter. Then he started going off on Ferguson Ferguson stuff and then.

Speaker 3:          01:35:10       Well, what did you see when you talk about things like that, like do you know specifically what he said about Ferguson? I know I can pull it up at that memory. What we know is about what Joe Derosa talked about the other day, but he didn't cite any specifics either. So I don't know what Anthony said about Ferguson. If I knew that I can comment on it specifically.

Speaker 2:          01:35:26       Well, I mean, I mean I follow them on twitter and he. He's still doing silly things that you think about Ferguson. Yeah. You gotta keep blowing stuff up to go that deep into that point. What I'm saying is you can go on his twitter and see what I'm saying, but what I'm talking about, he doesn't back off. Well, he doesn't have. He doesn't. He doesn't back off for a reason. It seems like. I think most people, if you got that much, like you lost your job, you got in trouble on twitter about a certain subject. Then I'm like alright, I'm not going to talk about Pi for awhile. Definitely

Speaker 3:          01:35:55       because he. Because he immediately show, yeah, he immediately made like a chunk of money, you know, it's like a netflix subscription type thing. So he immediately made like a gang of money off that I assume so. I don't know. I don't know how well he's doing, but I hope he does. Well. I thought that it'd be probably smarter if he did it through subscription that way more or through, um, through advertisers because advertisers, that way, you know, it's going to get a large number of people that are gonna listen to it because if it's free, you know, like, but he's Kinda like hamstringing himself by making a subscription service. But I think it's tough to make it costs money. Like you're definitely cutting people out of it, but I think there'll be an initial thing, but you have to like get people to catch latch on board.

Speaker 3:          01:36:36       It's really hard to get people to pay for Shit on the Internet in this day and age. Howard Stern Howard stern gives you like, you know, I mean you basically are paying for serious for like that or, and a. and you can't argue that like starring channel that gives you tons of energy for what you're paying. Like he gives you a lot of different stuff. It's like him all day and other shows and there's old content and just like fun productions and stuff. But that's not online. That's on serious. It's like if you subscribed to series, is that what you're saying? You can get that online took. Yeah. Yeah, but I'm saying but I told her for making people pay for something. But he had but he did 20 some years of giving it for free. So now you can get or you. We're talking about two different things. We're talking about satellite radio or we're talking about Internet subscription.

Speaker 3:          01:37:14       Does he have an internet subscription? Was same thing. I mean it is like you could watch it online sterns thing. Well Sorta, but it's satellite radio. You're working for a company. I mean it's not like what Anthony's doing. Anthony's doing completely independent Internet subscription thing. I was confused, but now Howard went from being for free to ask for basically it costs money to listen to them if you want to. I'm saying, oop, going from like, you know, he didn't live as a free and then years of, you know, he wasn't a specific charge for Sirius xm even though he was like, yeah, he wasn't. But now he's asking for a netflix amount of money for one show. That's what I'm saying. There's no variety. There's no like, uh, he's not really giving you anything besides. Well, that's very true to our show. It's very different because first of

Speaker 1:          01:37:55       all serious is in so many cars. When you buy it, you buy it, you get a 90 day subscription and it plays and you get to listen to stern. You get addicted to it and listen to all the different music channels to get addicted to it. But you're paying for satellite radio. You're not paying for a specific show on the Internet. That is a complete total difference in what you're getting. Like the get something on the Internet is what I'm saying. It's very difficult to pay for. Get people to pay for something that's on the Internet. It's not difficult to get people to subscribe to satellite radio, especially the satellite radios in their car. Bazillions of people like Netflix and that's all Internet based. Yeah. Netflix gives you thousands of options. That's the point I'm making. I think it's hard to be able to pay for like one, two hour show a day, four days a week, flicks his movies and television shows me.

Speaker 1:          01:38:38       If you're paying for Netflix, you're paying for something that you can watch on television. I mean it gives you a good watch, anthony show on TV, but that's not how most people are probably watching it. I bet the majority of the people that listened to a show or getting it, they're getting it on like as a, as an audio thing that they listened to on the subway or something or in the car. That's what most people do with these things. It's just it's hard to get people to pay for Shit online. You know what I mean? People are trying to do it. Like drive plus is a drive is a youtube channel that I really love. It's a. it's all about very sports cars and the inner workings of them and they do all these really cool in depth pieces. They just changed their format and then it became drive plus and they made people subscribed to it and the video they did it to.

Speaker 1:          01:39:23       The first one was one that I was a part of. This shark works company that makes these cars and the comments were just filled with pissed off people. He was so fucking mad. I mean they were so mad that all of a sudden they were going to be forced to have to pay. I forget what the amount of month is. I don't think it was a lot like five bucks or something. I don't remember though. And people, the entire comments for the video was all about people being angry that they had to pay for it. The to Hulu thing was with their or fall off or whatever. When they went from, hey, have it all for free to like now we charge you. Yeah. I don't know. I bet they lost a lot of people. I mean that's just what happens. People don't want to pay for shit, but Netflix is so good.

Speaker 1:          01:40:03       There's so much stuff and they have their own independent programming like that house of cards show or they're doing a Chelsea handler's going to do a show on it, like they're. They're actually becoming like a network, so if you pay x amount a month for it, the amount of content that they have access to is fucking incredible. I like that plan to or they just released the season as a whole right away. That really does make for like, well there's also some weird shit that goes on with them with like cable Internet providers and did different internet providers. Like now they're going to have to pay more because they use up more like they have to cut deals. Otherwise they throttled back netflix users. There's a lot of like weird shady shit when it comes to like bandwidth and how much bandwidth is worth and how much bandwidth gets soaked up by different applications. Which shitty Ben Affleck, Justin timberlake movie

Speaker 5:          01:40:54       or you're going to make about that guys fighting for bandwidth. The behind the scenes war

Speaker 4:          01:40:59       with wars. Yeah. It's tricky, man, if you're trying to sell shit online, unless you're a Netflix, like if hbo became an online thing only even with all their awesome shows that they have there will be tough.

Speaker 5:          01:41:13       Although that said the hipsters have dominated that world and a lot of them don't do cable at all and just get like a subscription to hbo go and Showtime Dot Com and all that stuff and they watch all their shit like that. Well there's a lot of people that do it through itunes. Yeah, you do like apple, you know, you'd get an apple tv thing and you kind of get a switch and all those things. It's probably cost you somewhere like 50 bucks a month and you could be pretty much have access to everything like the next day. Pretty close.

Speaker 4:          01:41:39       I mean there's a lot of shit you get. I mean I use a itunes for a. I use the apple TV to watch that show, the strain and I tried to watch it on regular TV. Oh my God. The fucking commercials make you hemorrhage. You can't leave. How often the fucking commercials come on. It's like a couple minutes in Bam as another commercial and then a couple minutes after that, Bam, there's another commercial like, oh my God,

Speaker 5:          01:42:03       like they just assault you with commercials. I keep cable direct TV for a few. One of the football package is huge, but two, there's also something that makes me feel like an adult having, having, having a cable. Do you know what I mean? Like you're supposed to have cable. I don't know why, but it really does. It mean just like a. either I stopped now but for a long time. Well, beyond needing one. I always had a house phone, like a land logs. I was like, you're supposed to have a landline just in case, but it's just gone off the cell phone now

Speaker 4:          01:42:33       after a while. Well it's also like you don't ever want to have something that you can't just turn off. Yeah. The beautiful thing about cell phones just shut that bitch off and nobody can put. Yeah. But um, yeah, like those, a lot of people do that Netflix thing now where they don't have cable. I just have netflix and use the computer for shit. And then hook up one of those. I do it right now. I just went and it's great because you could just target what you want instead of listening to background noise. Pretty much. Yeah. That's probably smart. Keep you from watching as much stuff too. Not just flipping through the channels and then you want, you know, sometimes there's a search process to like, what do I want to see here? And you'd go on and sometimes I'll take a half an hour just looking for a good movie to watch. It's just wasted half hour here.

Speaker 5:          01:43:16       But like having cable, like I'll never seek out the movie breaking ever again. But I'll watch the last 45 minutes of it three times a week if it plumps on. Yeah. If I'm flipping through the channels and roadhouse comes on, it's like 2:00 and you're not going to stop.

Speaker 4:          01:43:30       I'm going to wash that shit. It's like a gift of the universe. If you're like alone in a hotel room, flipping through the channels and Roadhouse,

Speaker 5:          01:43:36       you're on the road, he'll start laughing. You gotta watch it. You owe it to the Jeff Healey band to deal with. I want you to be nice until it's time to not be nice. How I know that is. I will tell you, my mom used to come home from work in the middle of the night and feed my little brother. We didn't

Speaker 3:          01:43:52       have cable and we had a VCR and we had roadhouse and she'd watch roadhouse every night. My mother knows every road roadhouse. That's ridiculous. Yeah, it was a vhs. Whoa. You have vhs. Oh my God. I had that and hard to kill on the same tape and we watched it constantly. You know what's amazing? If you could go back in time to when those, uh, video stores were out, like a local video store is like every community. How to like a local video store, like a mom and pop video. Sure. And then the blockbuster came in and fucking, oh my God, blockbusters. Gonna shut down all these mom and pop video stores. And a lot of ways they did. Except blockbuster didn't have porn. That's what kept them alive. So if you wanted to get the porn, you'd have to go to the mom and pop video stores came back to that day when those things were all like everywhere and you said within a couple of decades these won't even exist anymore to go.

Speaker 3:          01:44:41       You're gone. You're going to get everything out of the air. People will be like, what? Yeah, he just going to press a button on a machine and you're going to get it out of the air specifically for porn. What you had to go through to like our franchise in Philly, we had a place called west coast video and you had it all and there's red boxes. Everything was going to have red box. There was no, like the covers were up on the wall. You got a red box. And the beauty of that was I would try to just like find like my mom and step pop would rent porno movies when I was younger I guess for them, for themselves. And I would they leave in the VCR. We only had one VCR, so they, I guess they'd watch it when I stayed at my grandma's and I'd come, I'd see the title of it and I will always find titles that weren't very porn sounding and then I would go stay at my grandma's the next night and I would tell her like, hey, if I reserve movies, go pick them up and I would reserve.

Speaker 3:          01:45:30       That's it. My little grand mom, go pick up porn movies for me. It's God. She'd be wanting to make popcorn and we'll watch it together. I'm like, Oh, I'm going to probably watch it later. Did she ever call you on it now? But one time I never returned one and they ended up calling and uh, to keep it, I just tried to keep. It was a terrible. It wasn't even a point. It was when I rented, it was like a, like a skit, a maxi type thing. I had a friend that if the videos were really good, he would not bring them back because he was like, I'll take the penalty. I need to keep this one borns. Oh, I had a guy take me a court for that, for not returning and then eventually, like the only reason I got the hook eventually is it was a mom and pop place that went on there.

Speaker 3:          01:46:09       It's called wow video. There was a mom and pop place when I used to hang out this pool hall in White Plains, New York, and there was a mom and pop place across the street that they found out had tracy lord videos that were illegal. Wow. And the guys at the pool hall found out about it and so they took them all and they, uh, they pay the penalty on all of them. They just like, they're like, these are valuable because she's under age and I'm like, Bro, that shit, what the fuck you doing? She means she looked like she was of age. She had large breast diseases and she was, she looked like she was enjoying it sexually. This big banana tits. Yeah. They were weird sets, but I'm beautiful girl. But anyway, she was fucking like 17 years old or 16 years old at the time when they were.

Speaker 3:          01:46:54       When she was making these big soft. These guys found out about it. Yeah. Well the whole deal. She was a woman. I mean she looked like a woman. She's obviously a little girl, but if you looked at her like, what is that? You'd say, well that's a naked woman. No, no, no. She's 16. You piece of shit. What the fuck? How would I know you showed me or naked. I watch a documentary is like, her boyfriends were like in their mid twenties, early thirties and shit with none of them have any idea. You mean the guys on the show? Our actual boyfriends. She had her boyfriend show orange. I'm calling the porn video. This show, the guy that she dated the porn stars for Awhile. Oh, she dated this guy, Tom Byron. Remember when there's only like four dudes porn stars like Peter North. Tom Is always the first one because he shut the biggest load.

Speaker 3:          01:47:38       Isn't it? Weirdly gay? That's the reason it's gay or that he did gay porn did before that. Yeah, he did gay porn, uh, wasting those big loads on dude buts I don't know about wasting. I'm enjoying it and this is pre Viagara, so he was really getting hard for gay guys. He stayed in there like he stayed in the game a really long time simply because of those loads. There were ridiculous. The fact that I know what you're talking about, like if you brought it up about any other performer, you'd be like, I'm calling them performer. What do you call them? What do you call a guy? This artist's chicks, adult artists. Peter North powerhouse, sort of everybody knew those were the things you knew Ron. Jeremy can count down from 10 and income and Peter North shoots, but I didn't know that. Everybody knows that. I didn't fucking know that you guys had jeremy know that all was porn is what he would do.

Speaker 3:          01:48:32       He's counting down from 10 or it has the girl countdown and then when she says when he pulls out and blows a load, no kidding. Really. I had no idea. No idea about that either. Yeah, that's a weird thing to know. You guys take a little time into another hedgehog. Watch it. How many points have you watched? Oh, tons. I stack collection action. Yeah. And all the tapes were the tapes were red rose, like shitty colors to read. Videotapes. Yeah, right. The cheapest fucking stuff that I had a friend side. I had a friend who had two vcrs, black dude named frank. He would just make compilation of like his favorite come a great. They were great to borrow. No because whatever it was, it was like fat ass white bitches and then just be like all. So he was like the first compilation guys because they have compilations now the way before the Internet.

Speaker 3:          01:49:18       But I think if I was a, I'd have a severe problem if I grew up with like the Internet. It was good that I was here that I had to like really work to get my porn use severe problem if you had instant access. Absolutely. And I feel so young. I think a lot of people do have a problem and I think it's as someone who has a daughter, I fucking hate that. You know, facial cumshots as part of the common day, you know what I mean? Like that's what you do right out of the gates center sex to right as the gates sexually know. One girl, like I said, I'm not going back to that. I'm 36 years old, but I do remember in school like the girls who fucked it was kind of quiet and the ones who everybody knew fucked were kind.

Speaker 3:          01:49:58       They were kind of Shitty to them. They kind of got like, you know, like oh she's a slut. Which was just all the guys wishing they were fucking, you know, wishing they were fucking her but still like vilify, you know, I think, I think the Internet is just like made that completely like 16 year old girls talking about who sucks Dick Better. That's crazy. Is that really what's going on? Are you there when this is happening? Are you hearing rumors now? It's happening. No, no, no, no, sure. I have siblings who were very younger than me because I was step father. So I have a sister who still in high school. Oh. So I mean like she's, you know, hopefully the best of my knowledge not doing this stuff, but they were doing a thing a few years ago where the, uh, the kids would wear the colors, you snap off the color, that means like, you know, finger your asshole in the locker room and then you go do it.

Speaker 3:          01:50:41       And the girls would always be like, ugh, so unfair like walk and they would just go do it because he goes, oh yeah, that was the rule of bracelet rule. If you imagine if that was going on when I was young, I don't know, I would never be a comic, that's for sure. I would have got nothing done. Do you really believe that though? Yeah. You would eventually become a comic. You would just get bored of it. Maybe. Maybe. But I mean I, even now I had one point, I lived with a guy who worked for the cable company, so we got unblocked. Just a shitty playboy channel. Like how benign the playboy channel is. And if I was playing madden on the loading screens on playstation two, I would constantly flip back, like back and forth to the playbook to see whatever it was [inaudible] there'll be a girl with her pussy out and that would just for some reason I like, I'm going to watch that for a minute and then come back to the loading screen date.

Speaker 3:          01:51:26       Remember when they had fake porn that like Emmanuelle series on showtime. You'd watch these weird movies. It was like kind of, it wasn't, it was romance that wasn't designed for women. It was like romance that was designed for couples or men to watch. So it eventually got two people having sex. But all you really saw was like you saw breasts and he saw the man, like fake humping the girl. But he knows he saw no penetration. But you could tell like their organs were ms.like their sexual organs were not lined up correctly. Was blowing them. But she's like head butting him in the chest. Yeah. And if he was banging her like where's her pussy sitting there and belly buttons. Weird. Some strange place. None of it made any sense, you know, and, but they were fake Moan, uh, and they were always on late at night.

Speaker 3:          01:52:15       That crap, man, do they. I couldn't jerk off that. Now if I tried for a long, there's no way I'm too far gone. Yeah, you can't go back. But you could if you were like trapped though, like if you were like in the Amazon jungle for like six months and then all of a sudden you got to a hotel room like, oh my God, tv and you flip through the channels and carry on. Emmanuelle was on and it was like little shitty filter because there are those cameras they used back then were dog shit. So it was like there was no adhd really low and kind of Fuzzy and Oh, I used to be able to jerk off to like the girls gone wild like promo video on like each channel night. But I mean it's just like, that's just such a thing of the past.

Speaker 3:          01:52:54       I couldn't even. Everyone was like, how could you, why you couldn't get so excited to the, uh, the fattening thing. All the celebrity nudes that came out because still images. I can't check off the still images anymore. Yeah, and the only thing that's hard about it. Well they're hot, but it's just that they're famous and you know them from something else. That's always a big thing about porn stars. It's like people used to have this idea, at least that the really beautiful women were important stars to really beautiful women were like Cindy Crawford or you know, whoever fill in the blank. Farrah Fawcett, those are the really beautiful ones. And the porn stars zero. A couple of notches behind. But there's porn stars today that are fucking tens. Yeah. Unbelievably beautiful. If you look at and be like, that girl could be Lindsay Lohan. She could be a supermodel.

Speaker 3:          01:53:42       She could be anything. And she's just getting old. Yeah. Good Dick, you know, talk about. But they've also like removed like the excitement of exits. So out there like there's still something more exciting if you saw a girl that was hot at the gas station and somehow you were able to see her 10 minutes later, like do something where you opened the door by accident. She was naked. That's way more exciting. Do you know what I mean? I guess because you're seeing them. It's from a different context. Like a porn star, you know you're going to see if that same pornstar happened to be the star of a Sitcom and you saw her naked. That would make that so much more exciting. But the fact that she's, you know her from sucking Dick, like seeing her pussy. Isn't that exciting? I guess I see what you're saying.

Speaker 3:          01:54:25       Yeah. Unless you weren't being inundated with porn. See if you. If you're being inundated with porn, I think that's the real issue is you get numb to the porn and then with the real excitement is like, oh, I'm not supposed to be seeing this porn. So it makes it exciting. My favorite comment, if you weren't going video shit, if you weren't getting inundated with porn and then you saw some porn, some naked sex, you'd be like, well this is great. You get excited. Oh yeah. Numbness. That's what it is. Yeah. Well you're also get like A. I think I also used to be able to jerk off and fucking three minutes. Now it's like a. it's a whole process because you're like, I could find a better video. It's like a challenge to yourself and then the head shake. You make it yourself when you're just jerking off to that third one you found like 40 minutes later you're like, come on man, I could have made phone calls.

Speaker 3:          01:55:10       I got emails to send out a lot of shit done. Yeah, and here I am right back at the same stupid bachelor party gang. Bang. Well it's like those a monkey tests they do with cocaine and heroin and give the monkey heroin. They take the heroin once a day and they're straight. They give them monkeys coke and they just keep hitting that coke button until they're fucking hearts explode. You know? There's something about giving guys access to constant 24 hour porn. I mean that's where all that gagging shit and gaping and fucking all the abuse porins got to become violent. Well, it comes out like, what's next? We've done all this. What's next? We're going to fucking pee and girls' butts. Okay, okay. How about we p and girls' butts and we attached a Straw that pee pee and we make them drink it out of their own. But that guy's in jail. I said, yeah, he hasn't yelled is out now as you ever see that documentary and Max Heart Max hardcore. Did you ever see that documentary

Speaker 5:          01:56:00       called hardcore where the girl comes over from England? It's a. it'll make you like furious at that guy. You ever seen it before? I think I saw clips of it on effect. It's a, it's a girl who comes from England, you know, porn producers like your beautiful baby you're going to do basically starts off. We're just gonna do like pictures and lesbian porn. And then before you know it, like they get to sets and it's like, well I thought you said we're just going to watch today. It's like, no baby. Come on. Like I told him, you're doing this anal porn today. She's like, well, I said no anal. And he's like, wow, come. It's more money if you do it. And it's really watching them break a girl down to a one point, a Max hardcore, I believe it is getting ready to do something terrible to her.

Speaker 5:          01:56:37       And she finally, after crying he, she said she didn't want to do it. The first thing he does is he walks into a room when she's going to meet Max Hardcore for the first time, a bunch of people in this room and the documentary crew, he walks in, he shakes everyone's hand and goes over to her, seems very real. Pulls her panties down and stuffs as Dick in her asshole. And she makes a face like it's pretty real. And she gets weeded out. And then he goes, let's go upstairs. He starts talking into a scene. She says she doesn't want to do it. He gets really, first thing he tries to do is hit her with the baby. You're beautiful, you're going gonna. Make a lot of money. This is a great thing. People want to see your beautiful body. He does that for about five minutes and then he kicks right into you. Stupid Bitch, check or whatever. Go back to England and tell your kid you can't take care of her and just fucking okay, good. Can waste my fucking time. And then she agreed to do it and the documentary guy step in and they turn the camera off and just says like, at this point we thought she wasn't responsible for self anymore. They pulled her out of it.

Speaker 3:          01:57:31       Okay. Is this a hundred percent confirmed? Did you sure that this wasn't in any way set up? That's why you know, like there's a lot of these porn scenarios where they do a casting couches. No, no, no, but there's a documentary couches. No, I know that there's other ones that they do where it's totally rigged. Yeah. I think most of them always rig, this is not a thing. This is a full length, like two hour documentary. It's about this girl that was just one scene, but they showed him fucking her in the ass. She doesn't. She's not opposed. Okay. But she goes, yes, yes. They say, well they don't show it as dick going in because it's just not the way. It's a documentary guy. So it's like if it happened in the corner over there. So they're not showing the actual sex. Yes, they show it. They just don't show the penetration. But you see him put his dinner and she and her makeup face and get weird. I don't know if that's. I don't know if that's a setup. You know what I'm saying? Like do you know that that's not a set up. Obviously I can't confirm it to 107.

Speaker 5:          01:58:24       Do a weird thing in this documentary. Sounds like a real documentary. I mean if it wasn't a porn documentary, they would show like real porn.

Speaker 3:          01:58:30       Yeah. No, they don't show. There's no penetration. Doesn't necessarily mean it's true that that's not necessarily true. I mean, I don't know. I see what you're saying. Like it sounds like it could be real, but it also could be something that they set. I don't

Speaker 4:          01:58:42       know anything good, but you know what I mean? It's the same. That same world. You know what I'm saying? That world of the fake auditions that turn, but this isn't. This isn't a, this isn't a jerk off bubble thing in any way. This whole thing is terribly like, what the fuck is this guy doing? This girl was like, is he really doing that? It's not a. Oh, okay. It's not, it's not. There's no fancy. You sit around and you see the documentary guys like, like even like the, you know, the guys talking to each other like this, like should we do something? So He's just an evil guy that's out of control. Abusing the shit out of chicks and putting it on video. I've heard them on Howard Stern. Right? It seems like a pretty horrible dude, but I'm having a little bit, but it seemed like a horrible dude.

Speaker 4:          01:59:19       This is a road Dr. hold on a second. What'd you hear? That he seemed like he was a horrible on Howard stern is the way he talked. The girls come in, they want to be porn stars and he just like, he doesn't mean. It's like, well you're a little fat, but you know, I can work with that, you know, you know, right. Pig on your face. And he just kinda like, it's like a gruff, like shitty guys. Maybe it's a character for all I know, but I heard, but why be the villain? I mean the guy did go to jail. I don't know. You know what that was for? So I'll show you exactly what it was before he went to jail for. No, really? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Obscenity laws. It's a very scary thing. Look, I don't think that would he see. It's a tricky situation because I think anybody with any ethics or morals that looks at that guy and what the kind of videos he did, you don't want to be attached to that.

Speaker 4:          02:00:02       It's disgusting. I mean if even if it is fake, it's still like, man, what? Why does this get you off? Like you're just, you're being fucking horrible to these people if that's really what gets you off. Like what kind of a human being run, what kind of uh, what kind of a product are you selling. But the way they got them is there are certain places that have like really strict obscenity laws and so they prosecuted him in Florida and it's one area that had these really brutally strict obscenity laws. So they went after this guy, they targeted him, I think they saw the videos and he decided this is a piece of shit and we need to put this guy in jail. And they in their eyes, the prosecutors eyes. I think if I had a guess that they found a guy who had made this sort of a evil business off of a loophole and that loophole was the, the freedom of expression that he's allowed to have his own artistic interpretation of what's porn and what's not porn.

Speaker 4:          02:00:55       But anybody like you, that's a normal guy who wants to, you like, this guy's a piece of shit. Like he's making movies for fucking evil people. Yeah. To to want to get off to that as a very bizarre thing to me it is. It's definitely very bizarre, but it's also like at what point in time is it censorship at one point in time is like, who's to say that you can't. I mean if you made a movie, okay, this is a totally unrelated thing, but if you made a movie about a guy who was a horrible serial killer, right? And he's very statistic and it's part of the entertainment is this guy's very sadistic and then as long as someone catches that guy and kills him, most of us are like, wow, that was a fucked up movie, but they got them in the end. The problem with this is nobody gets it in the end except the girl girl gets it in the end. You know what I mean?

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       Like the girl gets abused and it's about abuse and that's it. There's no narrative. There's no like story arch arch where someone comes along and they fucking find this guy and they lock them up in jail at the end and then everybody feels safe. Now. It's just awful from the beginning to the end. It's awful. And then it ends. There's no plot. It's just him violating somebody and this and this. But it rolls on without him though. I mean there's like a thousand Max hardcore, I'm sure. Right. Those guys, they'll put on a on effect. I've seen them do those, uh, the compilations of like, just not even the sex part, just the guy's being mean to the chair. It's like they, they bring in like awful, like unattractive women and they shit on them and then fuck them. It's very weird. Yeah. And they smack 'em they sign up for the news is like physical abuse.

Speaker 3:          02:02:25       That would be illegal and you would actually go to jail for like, you can't smack a chicken the face, but you can't, you can't really set a waiver to say that's okay. I, you sorta can. I mean like wrestling, right? Ah, but it's different if it's a guy smacking a woman. I mean, let's be honest, isn't it? I'm morally, if a guy saw them, if they're doing a wrestling match and a guy smacks the guy, these guys are, they're agreeing to this. They're both guys. If two girls are doing it, they're both girls. But if a guy does it do a girl. But I mean there's been, there has to have been pro wrestling storylines where the guy accidentally swings and smacks the girl. Like that's part of the story lines. Uh, I mean, I just watched the other day a triple h put Stephanie Mcmahon and the pedigree. Well in movies for sure there's been domestic violence in movies without a doubt. But they're not really. No, no, no. But they're not really hitting. That's the actual contact. Nowhere in pro wrestling there is conscious that's the difference. And progressing, they're actually hitting. So if you've,

Speaker 2:          02:03:25       there's absolutely TV shows and movies that they hit each other.

Speaker 3:          02:03:28       No. You see a woman hit a man. You never see a man actually hit a woman in a movie that, a recent movie.

Speaker 2:          02:03:33       Well, I bet you there is in the last year some show that you have a, a man hit a woman and it's a real hit.

Speaker 3:          02:03:40       No, they can make no jersey shore though. No, but that wasn't set up. You can make it look like it's a real fear. You could make it look like it, but I've never seen. I've never seen a woman cough, a man or a man cuff, a woman in the face where I thought it was real. That Jersey shore, a Snooki got punched in the face by dude. Yeah. That was real hundred percent versus 100 or she got blasted and that's the type of thing you can't fake. I mean she just got popped. That guy was a fucking savage. That guy was a schoolteacher. I know an MMA fighter. Was He really? Yeah. Yeah. I mean he just uncorked on her face. I guess MMA has been around long enough now. There's just finally there's some guys coming out and disgracing the sport a little bit. There's always going to be crazy people and everything. Sports players, fucking whatever competition. Aggressive Holo athletes or people that are nuts. You're going to run into people, I mean in the most unlikely scenario, if it's a competition, you know you're going to run into not even if it's a competition, there's

Speaker 5:          02:04:38       probably asshole dentists that'll punch in the face of they're doing shots and then sometimes it works out as mma. Guys, it works out great. What? Remember that was at a world star hip hop video with the. Was it down in DC? Kind of unassuming white dude. Oh, Ryan Hall dropped a big black guy. Right. And the guy who gave up eventually. Yeah. And then it shows white party, the black dudes later and mounted them. Do you need me to kick his ass? Just held him down and just our grappled and let them know. Yeah. Let them know that it's going to get worse. That's so awesome. Yeah. Well especially if you haven't grappled before, you get tired so quick like, okay, okay, get off me. Like you don't have enough energy left to attack them. Like there's nothing left. I love. I love bullies getting knocked out video.

Speaker 5:          02:05:17       I do love those. Those make me happy. It's nice when you see that as comics. I think what you said about the thing about punching up earlier, it really is like we do seek justice to some degree. For sure. The, I just have a problem with the statement that all good comedy is punching up. That's just not true. It's a lot of good comedy that's punching sideways in a lot of good comedy that's punching down, but there's no but, but Louis Ck shitting on his daughter. There's no, like a lack of justice there. Do you know what I mean in that regard? Because you said you kind of know it's not only as an implied, it's very obvious. He's kidding. He loves his kid. Nobody makes an outward. Uh, and it's funny. No one does make it our thing with the, the fights people choose to pick.

Speaker 5:          02:05:55       When I did, uh, interestingly enough with the daughter thing, right? I did fallon a, I talk shit about my daughter for the first two minutes of it. And then I did Michael Vick jokes and thousands of hate mails the next day poured in over these Michael Vick jokes over imaginary dot. I say that, uh, he was on my team, so I have to love him because he's on my team at the time. He's on the Eagle still and I say, uh, I go, you know, I know he's a terrible dude and did some terrible things, but while he's on my team, just when like I'll throw him a dog, let them tear it apart, like a wearable for the end zone if he scores. And I said I'd mail them a box of puppies with a photograph of me shushing if he wins the super bowl and it killed in the room at the end. But then all the hate mail came in for that. And it was such a weird thing. It's like not one person was like, how do you shit talk your daughter like that, you know, you're telling a joke about shitting on her father's day present or something she got for you. It's like no one cares, but then there. But there was petitions online for a public apology from me for imaginary dogs. Dogs that don't exist. Well, once

Speaker 1:          02:06:56       things happened, people get excited and they want action. They want, they want you to apologize and if they can force you into action that they've won some sort of an online contest, you know, they've decided. They've written a blog about it. They started the Hashtag make Jay Oakerson Hashtag make jay apologize specifically. It's so bizarre to get that wound up about comedy ever. I don't get about everything man. I mean every fucking youtube video that comes out as a thousand comments. People at Duke it out in the comment section and people get fired up about almost everything and anything and if they have the license to be offended if people have the license to be offended, like they could think that what you said is not funny. You know, they can think that what said is cruel, but this licensed to be offended. You have her on my show. Again, this is my show. I like to show

Speaker 3:          02:07:42       actually blown away though, like offended people get us, but I feel like comedy should be void of that. Of course. Yeah. But sometimes I feel like we're treated like we're speaking to fucking congress, given affidavits in court. There's a laughing microphone behind me on a sign, you know, like what do you, will you see what's going on? People are just getting attention. You talk about it and you engage them and they get to be upset about you and find other folks that are upset about it as well. Everybody gets to be good to have a little attention to. That's why, you know, it's obviously one of the most famous moments on the show, but that's why I was always. I was, I was very, uh, tight with Kilstein Jamie Kilstein and one point I'm like, as a comic coming out against comedy that, that blew my mind so much when that happened. Yeah. The thing about still once in a while, yeah, I was still once in a while, go back and watch that whole thing because I'm trying to get where he was coming from with that. Where he's coming from. It

Speaker 1:          02:08:33       is a very rigid ideology. There's a very rigid ideology of, you know, what, what the, the down the people that are talking down on it, we call it the social justice warriors. They talk about it in a mocking sense, social justice warriors, but social justice warriors like the idea behind like this super male feminists, very liberal, very, you know, a lot of them Vegan like this, this whole idea of do the least amount of harm possible. They have a very rigid ideology when it comes to certain things. They don't leave any room for certain things to be discussed in a mocking manner, you know, and I think that you get stuck in that world if you're in that world. Like they have very rigid rules. They don't think you should ever say a joke about rape was really fucked up. As Jamie had one about rape.

Speaker 1:          02:09:19       It was about men getting raped and that was okay. It's like you can't, you can, you just can't have any mocking jokes about any woman getting raped. Even if the Daniel tosh situation, it was like such an obvious line that she yells out during is if no one knows the scenario. Tosh was on stage and he was asking the audience what they wanted to talk about because like occasionally someone will yell out a subject and it'd be pretty funny, you know, and then you may be able to come up with a bit from it. Who knows? He's just having a good time with the crowd being loose adlibbing. Some guy yells, talk about rape, and he goes and he starts listing off all the thing that's not funny about rape. Like what are you talking about? What is it? The humiliation, the physical violence like what part do you think is funny? And this woman like self righteously yells out. Actually there's nothing funny about rape as if he didn't know that is. If he wasn't saying that exact same thing and he goes, wouldn't be funny. Five guys raped right now. Like, and then everybody starts howling laughing. Why? Because it's a funny thing to say in that moment. Sure. Into argue against that. Saying like that promotes a culture that accepts rape is completely ridiculous. What it promotes is, is rallying against people that are stating the obvious there, stating the obvious to take moral high ground.

Speaker 4:          02:10:34       Actually, there's nothing funny about rape. Like he was saying that very thing with humor that there is nothing funny about rape. When she chimed in, it's a person that wanted attention. That's the same person that wrote that blog. She wrote a blog about it. That very person was like the nightmare person to say that too because she went and she wrote this blog and then he wound up giving us like fake apology, which is pretty hilarious

Speaker 5:          02:10:56       to show you. Did you see, uh, what law and order Svu did with that story? They made that into. They did. Oh yeah. You know, they do the polls from the headlines. So they had the guy, first of all, they refer to them as like the like where you going, like we're going up to the college campus to watch that. That new rape comic is intentional. They call him a rape comment was Jonathan Silverman plays him. That's hilarious. The new rape coming in town. So he goes up there and his jokes are all about, you know, like fucking chicks against her will to some degree, but everyone loves him. He's, he's getting huge applause and cheers. Oh my God. The SV into. What's funny about that is at one scene after they, they suspect a, he goes on trial because a girl almost got raped after his show.

Speaker 5:          02:11:41       A girl was a fan of his and they tried to make the argument that these guys wouldn't have tried to rape her if they weren't all goosed up from his comedy show. Well that was the actual argument and what they ended up doing with the story was first thing they do, it made me laugh was the whole Svu team goes and sits front row at his comedy show is what they do first and they're just sitting there staring and shaking their heads and you almost want to go. You guys are actually being a pretty shitty audience. Like at the end of the day, it's like if you're going to sit there and stare at least sit in the back. Like that seems like kind of a weird. Like you're making the show get weird and rapey by staring, staring at him, but then when they do, the big payoff is at the end of the whole episode. They make that. He was also a rapist. A. I actually tweeted out, I was like pretty fucking irresponsible. Like that's a really irresponsible thing that for the first show I got to do.

Speaker 4:          02:12:29       You would think that it, by the way, the kind of people that actually would be rapists, they would be talking about how rape is awful because they would probably be trying to throw people off the yes, they wouldn't be like raping all the time and then joking about rape and all the time like that sounds like the exact opposite of what you would do if you were trying not to get busted being a fucking rapist. Crack jokes. Are you trying to loosen people's expectations? Remember there was a comedian rapists remember that? Oh yeah. That would backtrack of schools. He would go to colleges and he would rape girls at colleges and he would ask them to pray for him. Really? Vince champ. Yeah, but they need to do a thing,

Speaker 5:          02:13:06       but then he'd do. He would go like those block bookings, like he would go to one school, pick up the check, go to the next goal and then double back. So that's how the. I think he pulled it off for awhile.

Speaker 4:          02:13:16       I didn't know he had a strategy. Did you have a strategy and what? I understand I could be wrong with that obviously, but that's where I've. I've heard that from several sources that it was like a doubling back thing. He won star search in 1992 and he's serving a 55 to 70 year sentence for committed at college campuses on a standup circuit. How many did they say? How many rapes? There's a bunch. I don't know man. The story I'm looking for has been removed from the.

Speaker 5:          02:13:40       How many rapes were the while there was somebody rapes

Speaker 4:          02:13:43       nineties. Like I rates it was in the late nineties. Yeah. I don't know how many guys, how many girls he raped, but he would have asked them to pray for them, which is really fucked. Rave. The last thing a chick wants to hear what you're raping them. You feel bad about the rape.

Speaker 5:          02:13:59       I think rape, rape, there always has to be like, it seems to me like there's gotta be a shut up or I'll do this element to it because I feel like you just couldn't. It's like professional wrestling, like how you couldn't suplex somebody like a vertical suplex that doesn't want to be suplex that you couldn't possibly do it. Someone I feel like, how could you fuck someone who's really snapping their legs shut and fighting. That almost seems like it's an impossible task. Are you serious? It's got physically for real. Yeah. I mean it's something that, it happens all the time. Obviously you can happen. Nobody saying. I think there's always an element. I think eventually the girl kind of has to do like some kind of like get this fucking over. If you fight physically fight the entire time, I think you almost couldn't pull it off.

Speaker 4:          02:14:39       Um, I don't know, man. I think a guy could probably pull it off. I think they do. I don't know even know what you're saying. Like guys, definitely rape.

Speaker 5:          02:14:48       I know. No girl, no price. Did it make it sound guy to say, guys, don't let guys girls fight them off.

Speaker 4:          02:14:54       Still rape him. That shit happens all the time. The land managers bigger, you know, big, strong men and small women. It's probably, they hold you down.

Speaker 5:          02:15:04       The seems pretty obvious I think though if needed. Booze. No, I mean like if you like, she's not going to be wet, you know, I'm not even talking about that. I'm talking to someone like nonstop, like physically flailing around, like to completely subdue someone's for. Have you ever just like playful? He wrestled with the girl, like with your girlfriend. It was like, uh Oh yeah, my, my chicken. If I tried to hold her arms and a tickle her and she's flailing like I don't think I can control her feeling. She's not a big girl at all. I control my growers. He can't move. Brian Kicks Ass on police. He's a fucking savage dude. You could stop a rape. Don't rape. Don't forget all personal appearances. Put that aside. He's a savage. Jesus Christ. Control my girl.

Speaker 4:          02:15:47       Yeah, you could look man. If you know how to wrestle, you could hold the chick down pretty God damn easy. It's not hard. Could hold up dude down,

Speaker 5:          02:15:54       but you have to hold her down and accomplish something that's sort of intricate to some degree.

Speaker 4:          02:15:59       I don't know. I don't know. This is a weird thing to speculate.

Speaker 5:          02:16:05       Let's break it down. How would you take it around the horn? Classroom? Judo, throw the Jujitsu and I think that, uh,

Speaker 4:          02:16:16       it probably be a Jew. It's like especially there's a lot of violence involved, right? Like hitting choking. I don't think it would be hard. I mean it would obviously it wouldn't be as easy as like normal sex. No, that's almost making the point. I'm saying by the time actually the sex part happens. I feel like there's just like give up to some degree, man. Yeah. I guess you can see me appearing at the Tomahawk University started announcing my college tour. It's called the don't worry. I don't believe I could possibly rape you tour. Hey, everybody has their own confidence level will put up. They, you pull off. He can't pull off in this life if you feel like you're limited in that regard. I can never dunk a basketball and I could never break. I was in two things. I physically can't pull off. He's a fucked up thing, man.

Speaker 4:          02:17:09       That that's like so common in the animal community like violence and sex. Like if you ever watched, I was watching this documentary or is listening to this podcast rather, uh, about Tasmanian devils and how vicious Tasmanian devils are with each other and that while they're having sex, like they almost, they always bite each other. They're constantly biting each other and they fuck each other's faces up like when they have sex and they fuck each other's faces up when they're fighting over a meal. They're constantly going at it. But there was a disease that was spreading amongst them. It was actually a type of cancer and the type of cancer was actually proving to be, um, something that's contagious. By some strange manner of evolution. These cancerous cells would burst and infect the cells around them. And so they, all these, a Tasmanian Devil started dying off because they started developing these cancerous, contagious tumors and they were constantly biting each other in the face so they would be biting into these tumors and the tumors would like literally make tumors on the other animals.

Speaker 4:          02:18:12       Jesus. Yeah. But just constantly attacking fucking mangling each other. Like that's what they did. They were just constantly like biting when they fucked his back and they make these crazy noises mad. This guy who is a, uh, if you ever listen to radio lab, you know, what I'm talking about was amazing podcast. It's an amazing podcast. And the podcast is all, you know, it's all like really interesting things that are like one of them they had about the problems with trying to communicate with dolphins and just really fascinating, fascinating stuff. One of them was on the apocalypse, like how, what the asteroid impact did and how many animals were killed off and what the original humans probably looked like. The thing that became a human that was alive back then, this fucking burrowing underground mammo rodent type thing. But um, they were doing this, this radio lab one on these Tasmanian devils in this cancer that was spreading.

Speaker 4:          02:19:06       It was fucking madness, man. Want to dig into stuff like that. Too much of it gives me a genuine anxiety, especially apocalypse stuff. Yeah. But you know, it's like, oh, it was always just a chance to meteor size of Texas could destroy the earth, which is weird that that became like a thing with these animals that they would bite and fuck while they're biting, biting each other in the face. And, and that's not a discussion. That's just nature. What's the nature of it? Yeah. It's not like constantly do it. Apparently they just bite. They just always fighting over meat and fucking biting each other in the face and flux and kills like immediately. So yeah, same, you know, it's like sodas, black widow, right? Yep. That's real common insect community. I on aunt wants this, a weird fucking ant that takes, they're almost all females and there's occasionally males and when they find a male, they bite his legs off, they bite his legs off and they bring the males like slightly larger.

Speaker 4:          02:20:00       They bite his legs off and then they carry them into the hive to breed and then they wind up killing him. They make him write a book. They just need to cripple them. He has like wings, I think to get the story of misery. You make them write a book of your favorite character. We have it. So we are such pussies. You know, we, we have a conversation about how difficult it would be to rape somebody and it's a dangerous subject to tread. You look into the nature world. It's like sex without rape. They're like, what are you talking about? That doesn't even happen. I wanted it. I take it. Yeah. There's the, that's how you make sure that are fucking. Well yeah. And the, the lion has to get through all the male lions. He has to prove his worth and then eventually he's going to get pushed out by some new young lions, you know, because he wants to keep like a few checks around and some new young lines again, and then he's going to be out there on his own.

Speaker 4:          02:20:47       They'd say that's like the biggest problem in Africa. Took a metaphor for snl for the new line, comes in, the other one gets sent out to pasture, so meadows ever watch that show, but like with a African villages that the real problem that they have is when a lion gets cast out and the females don't get the food anymore than the lions have to go get their own food and a lot of those old males, they start to get crippled and slow and the chip teeth off and shit. Then they become super dangerous because they can't get the normal game animals they used to getting. So then they start snatching people just. Oh yeah. Just so I keep proving themselves. Well, there was a leopard writing. There was a story about. It was in the news yesterday about a leopard in India that they'd taken us responsible. One individual leopard responsible for 15 deaths, 15 different people that had targets, drunk people and that it waits. Yeah. Fucked. Is that to grow? Yes.

Speaker 4:          02:21:42       Spot. Yeah. Well people, you know, they go out and they start partying and this leopard is apparently developed this taste for drunk people. Like he knows that when people come out of these bars, they're slow and they don't know what the fuck's going on. They're not on there, they're not on the ball and they get jacked. It's almost weird to walk out of anywhere in the world of a bar and there's a leopard waiting for you. Even in India. India is scary with. In fact, in India I find it more weird. There's a bar than a leopard waiting to kill you. I feel like the bombing. There's bars and India. Well, you know, it's interesting like India, everybody always thinks of as being like this place of peaceful meditation and Yoga. Right? I mean that's. A lot of people think of desert, but you, you hear about all these goddamn gang rapes like India. These stories of people getting like gang raped on buses and women dying. You don't. You hear about those quite a bit like that. I wouldn't have normally associated that with India. You know, we don't, we don't think of that, but it's like when you have a billion people, you get a lot of crazy shit going on. You've got a billion people stuffed on what continent he imagined. Yes.

Speaker 5:          02:22:43       I mean the young people anywhere picking up on that, especially with Internet, everything picking up on like the culture of all that stuff. So if you go to South Africa, there street gangs, you know and they think their bloods and crips because that's what they see really. Sure. Yeah. I mean it's not, I don't think there are directly affiliated, but there's like there's street gangs, you know, like that kind of thing in South Africa with a weird place like that. Do you remember

Speaker 4:          02:23:04       when there was an ice cube song about moving the crips and the bloods to the Midwest now was a song steady mom and I think it was road trip. It was, yeah, it was. Who was something like that where these, these gang bangers. It got too hot and La. So they set up gang affiliates in the middle of the country.

Speaker 5:          02:23:26       Oh, those are those like southern ones, like those documentaries, Hbo with the white boy gangs, like just a bunch of dudes wearing like bandannas over their face and caring. Hey sickles. More terrifying thing coming your way. It's like the children of the corn with Doo rags on. What was that show? It was like banging in this bank in Little Rock and little rock. That's. Wow. That's white trash guys. Get him geary. That scared a lot of people. Oh yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:23:52       Banging in little rock type shit. That scares a lot of people. The idea that this gang violence that you see in like Inglewood and Compton on the television shows that that's somehow under that Boyz in the hood. Shit could somehow to make it.

Speaker 5:          02:24:06       Yeah. And it's terrifying. Split when you see in the south. It's weird cause it looks. It's already kind of a scary area of like swampy overgrown hedges and stuff. And then there's like there's like a dude with an Uzi wearing a red flannel and swampy Louisiana whether

Speaker 4:          02:24:20       and if you. Yeah. Fuck. And if you're scared of it, you're racist. Just don't hit back. You know, I tell you what, I've talked about some shit on this podcast and gotten, you know, a lot of people's reactions about it. But one of the biggest reactions I ever got about anything I said was that I was talking about John Jones and I said, I wonder how much of like why is now popular is racism. I wonder if people are racist. Even say you wonder that someone might be racist. Like if if someone's reaction to something, it's probably like flipping of me to say like that's especially when you're not considering it before you're saying it, you're just discussing a subject because you did. It's interesting. It's such a charged subject. You've got to have a fully formed idea before you say it. But just the mere possibility that some people can be racist was such a. like people are so angry, like not even saying you're racist. Not saying the only way that you couldn't. Like the guy was because of racism. I said, I wonder how much of it is racism. I wonder if it's a factor. Because I always wonder about races.

Speaker 5:          02:25:17       I think he gives reasons beyond that, but I think it's a fair question. I mean he gives reasons to dislike him, he see on race. But

Speaker 4:          02:25:24       you know, at the same time, yes, some people will just, is it ridiculous? The notion that people would just blindly like thing just, you know what I mean? Like I don't know where we'll live in a world of apologies, don't apologize for asking. Well, it's, it's, it's just such a highly charged subject. It's a fascinating thing that it's so highly charged that you know, even a mere suggestion and if people thought in some way that I meant, if you don't like them is because you racist, then that's my shitty job of communicating an idea because that's certainly was never what I was thinking. But what I was thinking was, I think I know for a fact when I was a kid, I used to root for white guys. I just did like when George Gerry Cooney fought Larry Holmes, I remember very clearly being embarrassed that I rooted for Gerry Cooney because he was a white guy because I remember Larry Holmes box the shit out of him and he just picked them apart.

Speaker 4:          02:26:17       And before that mean Gerry Cooney was a really good fighter. He was a, he beat Ken Norton. He knocked them out, devastating knockout, and it was like, it was, he was a good fighter, but Larry Holmes was a master at the time and it was just, I should have been appreciating what Larry Holmes was able to do to this guy who'd been able to knock out some really good fighters that Larry Holmes was just using his skill and that it was. But I had been rooting for Gerry Cooney, so when he lost, I was like, Damn. It was because it was, it might've been because he was the underdog too. I was a kid. I was dumb. I know. I was rooting for it because he was white. I know it was, it was probably Blake. I was a senior or a junior, maybe a junior in high school. So I guess I was 16 and uh, yeah, it was just dumb.

Speaker 4:          02:26:58       I mean, it wasn't that I was racist because it's been going well. What we, what you attach to the most, like what you related to the most? I could be that guy. Yeah, most certainly. Most certainly. Yeah. But um, I did it a little bit when I was 20, not, but not nearly as enthusiastic with Tommy Morris screaming, I love you white box know with Tommy Mars that I was like, I just, you know, I was keeping an eye on him. How'd you feel that? The Ray Mercer. Oh my God. After that, that was the worst thing I've ever seen in my life. That knockout was so good that my friend Kevin, who is like a huge fan of Tommy Morrison was, was like, he wasn't even bummed out. He was like, damn, that dude's awesome. Just saying that, you know, ray mercer was so awesome. Even though he was rooting for Tommy, it was such a brutal knockout.

Speaker 4:          02:27:44       They just wanted to see rand mercer fight again. So good cuts of Ray Mercer whispering and the guys a year, a few years later, like, please take it down. I'll give you half the money. Who did he say that to? I forget, but it was like a core TV case. Oh, that's right. Oh my God. When they were in the clinch, he goes, take a dive. I'll give you half the money once that was it Bobby Chez? No. Who was it that he had a fight with? He had a fight with someone and it was an important. If you lost the fight, he was not going to get a title shot. Yeah. So he was. That's right. Or allegedly he asked him. I don't know if that's true. I don't know if you ever been proven. Was it ever proven you can look it up? I think he may have been found guilty of that.

Speaker 4:          02:28:20       Maybe. I don't know if you ever watch that documentary. Speaking of boxing, but the guy, what was his name? Where they, they made his inside of his gloves. So Resto? Yeah. Yeah, they fucked it was billy, Billy Collins Jr. He claims he didn't know he claims he didn't know. YeaH, that was a Panama lewis. That was the same guy who doctored up. Um, uh, aaron priors a drink. He said, don't give me that water. Give me the other one. The one that I fixed. And then he gives it to aaron pryor and aaron pryor goes out there like a fucking bat out of hell and knocks out alexis are way on the next round. And they said it was some sort of a stimulant and problem. Aaron pryor rather wind up having a bit of a drug problem. So rarely been, could have been related in that way.

Speaker 4:          02:28:59       But um, it's just weird how, how the, the, the ferocity of the reactions when I brought up this racism thing, maybe it was like irresponsible on my part, but I'm, I'm sort of happy that I brought it up anyway just because I'm fascinated by the response and I'm fascinated by no black people disagreed with me. That's the weird thing. The weird thing is the guys who disagreement, I don't know everybody who disagree with me on twitter, so I'm kind of talking out of my ass here, but the people that I interact with on a regular basis where their comics or whatever, they all thought it was. The black guYs all thought it was very valid that there's certain mount of like extra judgment that you give a cocky young black athlete and I was like, that's fascinating. I wonder if that's true. Even just paying attention to that.

Speaker 4:          02:29:44       That's something I wonder. I wonder what if a factor it is and it's not. It's not the only factor that there's $350 million People on this planet in this country rather, and if you know, if a million people like you in a miLlion people hate you this fucking wide variety of reasons, but to say that out of all the millions of people who know who you are, that they're on a certain percentage of them that are racist seems disingenuous. I mean iT seems like there's a certain amount of people across the board, they're going to be racist. If you have $350 million people. I don't know how many people you're going to get that the racist, but there's gotta be a certain percentage that has to be factored in there. Know, seeing. You wonder how much of it is. I think the interesting thing is that I think floyd mayweather, people that hate him, I bet there's a lot more racism involved in that than jon jones.

Speaker 4:          02:30:32       Jon jones gives you a pretty valid reasons. It'd be like sky sort of a dick just publicly from what you see, you know, I don't know anything about them other than what I see in the press and on the shows. But I mean like maybe whether it's a guy you know, you see, he's like, you know, the press is talking to him. He's like throwing $100 bills, you know, just like a master showman. That regard too though. But that personality feeds into someone who's got racism in their heart. That's really, that fires them up. Well. I've read some horrific shit about. Well, I've read, I've read some racist shit about both guys, about jon jones and about floyd mayweather, but this recent barrage of shit about people like how much hate they have for him after he fought my don and last. YoU know, I don't know if they were betting on my door. I don't know what it is, but that's also how he sells tickets. I mean he sells tickets by people wanting

Speaker 1:          02:31:20       him to lose, but he so fucking good. You could bArely hit him if, if he gets tagged once or twice hard and a fight. It's shocking and rare, but there's a lot of fights where he'll go like the entire fight to box in someone's face off and not get hit at all. So for every sugar, shane mosley who connects our. Every madonna right righthand that lands. This is like a lot of rounds where he's not even getting hit. He's just slipping out of things, move in and doing things to you that you didn't expect and moving in a way that you didn't anticipate and being nowhere near you when you're looking to hit him. You know, he's a master, but he's also a master at manipulation, mean he's playing the heel where I think john is just a young guy figuring it out on his own while he's one of the baddest man on the planet at 25 years of age and he's had this ridiculous rise to success that happened in a really short period of time.

Speaker 1:          02:32:11       Like from the time he was like 21 years old to the time that he's 25 starts martial arts and becomes the light heavyweight champion. I mean tHat's fucking crazy, man. He had a martial art background because he was a really good wrestler and did know some kicking and punching and stuff before he started into mma, but he got into mma because he got his girlfriend pregnant and he, you know, he couldn't go to college. He wanted to do the right thing and said, all right, fuck it. I'll start fighting and then got into it and he's a crazy road for anybody to take and to be that popular in that famous at 25, you're going to fuck up man. But there was going to make mistakes.

Speaker 5:          02:32:44       You got to watch. Can you almost pinpoint what it is when the switch flipped on him? I remember like I saw I went to, I went to ufc 101, uh, in philly, forrest griffin versus a silver and there he was walking around a jon jones is one brand and I remember, uh, my buddy dave was with me was like, there's jon jones. He's like, that Guy is bad ass and he's going to be the next chair. Like he was just really pumping up like saying how great he was and how fun of a young boy. And then I started paying attention to more and he was amazing. And then just one day just seems like people were like, what a dick.

Speaker 1:          02:33:15       Some people. Yeah. Yeah. When people want you to be perfect, they're looking for flaws too bad motherfucker cheating was the first thing I saw. He didn't do anything wrong in that. What do you mean?

Speaker 5:          02:33:25       I thought it was weird that he dropped him afterwards. I know it's an aggressive situation, but I think dropping a guy that he said he knew it was unconscious was. It was. It was kind of shitty for a sport where I thought, I thought this is all supposed to be handshakes at the end.

Speaker 1:          02:33:35       I see what you're saying. I see what you're saying. That mode though.

Speaker 5:          02:33:40       You could hear a. But when he walks over, it's funny, greg jackson, that you could hear him say to me. He goes, john goes, go when these people back and go check out if he's okay. He says, he goes, go check if he's okay,

Speaker 1:          02:33:49       They'll get some fan. Yeah, go get some fans. Yeah. No, that's true. Um, I think, but also I think to be a bad motherfucker at that high level, like a lot of times these guys are so intense that they get completely caught up in it and they just trapped in the moment. I think I know the dude. I know him from backstage. I know him from when he's not fighting and he's really friendly. He's really good, but I wouldn't want to be fighting them. I think if you're competing against him, I think he's all those that are at the top of the

Speaker 4:          02:34:18       heap there, pretty fucking ferocious and some guys are better at keeping it together in scenarios like that where they don't drop the guy. Some guys aren't. You know what I mean? Dan henderson is one of the greatest of all times, one of the most famous moments in his career as he knocked out michael bisping with his vicious right hand and bisping went soaring. I mean he was out cold and henderson dropped one on him. He afterwards, he talked about it in the post fight interview. How he dropped one on it. I mean that's common. So the last one was really running his mouth kind of thing. Exactly. Yeah. Baba lou, who's another famous mixed martial arts fighter, a great fighter who fought in a bunch of different organizations. He lost his gig with the ufc pArtially because he held onto this guy after he was done choking them and then talked about it in the post fight precedent interview with me, you know, and I'm.

Speaker 4:          02:35:06       That guy was not doing anything that bj penn hadn't done. Bj penn did the sAme thing that jens pulver like paula was tapping. He's still fucking hung onto it because they were angry at each other, but Pulver didn't go out, you know, and for whatever reason, him holding thAt choke for an extra couple of seconds was okay. Whereas bob blues guy went out and then he talked about it, but everybody knows why they do live. Sure they do it because they're fucking caught uP in all the trash talking and all the bullshit and you know, it is important that a fighter let go and a referee tell them not to, but it's understandable how these guys get caught up in that. It's understandable. It's got to stop doing it, but what john did technically is not. There's nothing wrong with it because when the referee came over to him, he didn't keep hanging onto it.

Speaker 4:          02:35:48       That would have been a more agregious example. More and more, you know, but it is one of those things where you appreciate like nate marquardt fought this guy, damien maia knocked him out with one punch. Damien was dazed but still conscious and marquardt hovered over him and pulled back, realized he was out of it. The referee stepped in and stopped it, but nate easily could have dropped a bomb on him and he didn't end. It was a really classy move and people really respected that, that he did that and I made sure I talked about it in the commentary. That is a very classy move for jones used to do that. Whereas you and she's like homeless, look at the ref like stopped and did that with vinny pazienza. He looked over at the ref and he's like, come on man, stop the fight. The referee said no.

Speaker 4:          02:36:26       He said okay, and then he went and dropped him again. You know, and yeah, didn't mean there's moments because I think an interesting thing when once you lose your mojo, man, it's amazing, isn't it? Amazing. Boy jones overnight went from like still doing amazing things and then he lost it. He lost again and he lost. It can go. It's like once you stop believing in yourself as an athlete, like you believe it is a lot to do with you believing you're indestructible. Once you see that chicken, your own armor, man, getting that, getting that energy back up to do it again must be really, really hard. Yeah, I guarantee and there was a lot of other factors involved in roy too because he went up to heAvyweight and then really how to dehydrate himself and we can absolve very badly getting back down the light heavyweight again and then he got knocked out.

Speaker 4:          02:37:11       I mean he fought. I'm Alan Johnson right now. Glenn knocked him out after god dammit, I can't believe harbor. Yes. Antonio tarver tarpon knocked him out. Tara was the first guy to stop him and he did it in a fight where it was a rematch of a fight that they had that was very close, and then roy went up to heavyweight. He box John Ruiz and beat him for the title. Then came down to light heavyweight and in losing that 25 pounds, he really dehydrated the shit out of himself. He looked terrible. He looked like he had starved is he lost all of his, like his, his like hardness to his muscles. He looked terrible. It was a really ugly weight cut and he might've been done some shit to get up to heavyweight too. That's possible. And then you get off that shit. Your hormone levels crash.

Speaker 4:          02:37:54       That's a speculation, but the bottom line was tarver knocked him out and when tarver connected and carver was a big puncher and we connected and knocked them out, roy was never the same. Then the glen johnson fight with scary. It's never the same. It's just one day just happens. It's Mike Tyson was never to say lennox lewis. Yeah. He was never the same necessarily after jail, but he's still pretty ferocious. They have to do well. He tyson went to jail after he lost the title. Tyson and last and then went to jail and came back was still fucking for ferocious. The difference in like whAt happened with roy's at roy fought again, like within a certain amount of time it got knocked out really bad and when you get knocked out by a guy, when you get your brain's scrambled like it takes a long time for tea.

Speaker 4:          02:38:35       It looks like freddy roach is a genius and one of the things that he did brilliantly with manny pacquiao is after pack y'all got knocked out. He told him like, you're not going to fight for a year. He's like, take your head out of this like there's no more. We're gonna. That was a bad knockout. And freddy is a guy who suffers from a trauma related parkinson's himself. He's got the shakes from his career in boxing and so because of that he's super, super aware of damage and he's like, look, you could be okay, but you got to heal up like there's no contact for a long time. You're going to not fight for a year. And then he came back a year later and he looked great. He looked like manny pacquiao and it's. I think that rest time is super important. That recuperation time. It's very important when god gets knocked out and so we saw roy get beat by that guy or get beat by tarver and then beat again by johnson and a really scary way.

Speaker 4:          02:39:26       Yeah, yeah. That's what he went through the ropes. Well, he went down and back to his. He banged his head off the ground and he was stiff at the end of the fight. Like he was like stiff in this weird, scary way and it, it didn't look like the kind of punch that would do that to you. Like it didn't look like the kind of punch that would really put you in a catatonic state. Like that was. That was scary as shit man. It wAs also scared because Roy Jones, you know, he used to be invincible. Yeah, that's what I mean. Watching that haPpen to people is very, you know, watching like, you know Michael Jordan number 45, come back on the Washington wizards, you know, you're like, well it's like watching Michael Jordan play baseball. Yeah. That was the first thing I get them in. Yeah, that was definitely the first thing. But I mean, but to come back because he came back and it was pretty great again, but by the time he came back from

Speaker 3:          02:40:14       the wizards that one time it was like, why? Even like you never wanted to believe it wouldn't be good anymore. I never saw that. I saw him. He come back. That was tough to watch. I that with a being from philly iverson when he came back for like did like 16 games before he left again. And to have some weird situation where like when he gets to be 50, he gets like some giant chunk of money apparently. Yeah. Either with a reebok. Yes. And kind of like the like trust or something a weird. but he's broken out right now. That's what they say. At least that he was begging for money. It will. AS it turned out it was bullshit. right? Wasn't that a bullshit story? They're begging for and they just retired his number. He looks fine, you know, like no, somebody was. Somebody was saying that he was outside of a mall asking for money.

Speaker 3:          02:40:54       But then I think that turned out to be like bullshit rumor that someone started. Yeah, that's absolutely. I heard marilyn manson lives above a liquor store here in la. There's no might. He might do that just to be a fucking crazy person. Marilyn manson is the real deal. Dude. Talk to stan stan. Hope now he's moments my favorite rock star of all time. do you know? Stand up? Yeah. Yeah. Do you need to talk to stan? Hope about manson. They hung out. Oh good lord. Really? Oh, I don't want to say anything on the air. It's not my place. But go ask. He's, he's not playing games. Sounds like an absence story that involves a lot of different things. You need to hear it all from standing up. I will look into that. Mellon manson or talked to tate fletcher. Fletcher's hung out with them too.

Speaker 3:          02:41:37       I've never met marilyn manson because uh, for the same reason. Every time I see dice, I never really talked to him because I'm like, if this guy's a douche bag to me, it's going to just destroy my thing. Dice would be cool to you. If you're a comic on bobby kelly's podcast, they made me read it. I wrote him. I got stolen one night and just this is, this should have happened 15 years ago, not a year and a half ago. I wrote him some faceBook. He loved letter and the return thing was like, ah, this is actually licensed assistant. He doesn't really check it. Yes. Oh, I gave them references to who to ask about me, you know? How long had you been doing comedy when you did that? Fourteen years.

Speaker 3:          02:42:20       It was a year and a half ago. I got stoned and I was like, oh, you know what it was. I got stolen that I was listening to dice. Man cometh and dice bank. Come with whoa. Look as a, as a professional adult comic now doing it many years, like I, I see the holes and everyone's game. I'll wait. You know what I mean? Like I don't. There's no pedestal that I have mom, except for the fact that dice when I was younger, I loved him. It was my favorite thing in the world, was part of the reason I would be funny. Like I would go to school and recite dice lines and it was also a bonding thing that me and my step, my step pup started dating my mom and staying over and everything like that. Like he would let me watch dice, like he brought that into my life. That was our, like our bonding thing that we both just loved ice. So now when I see him, just one of those guys just like you, that I just, somehow we haven't crossed paths and uh, I've seen him once them once in a while I'm like, I'm to go talk to them and I just don't. well, if I'm ever around them and you're around them, I'll introduce

Speaker 1:          02:43:12       you. he's great. He's fun and he's been on the podcast a bunch of time. He's been great on the puck. Yeah. I hung out with him in norton and anthony and uh, it was as a bunch of us and brian and who else was with us was Bobby Kelly? No, it wasn't Bobby Kelly. Kelly. Yeah. Bobby kelly was there too. Yeah. And we all saw him. We went to his show and uh, in vegas at the riviera. Nice. Which is the classic venue place I've ever played. Hasn't changed since 1970. I mean, they haven't done a goddamn thing. They've washed the floor. That's it. At the comedy club? Yeah. The upstairs right across from the dancing girls shows that the above thing. Theater. They used to have the frank marino drag show in drag queen show. Did you ever see that? No. Oh, it was great. He's like, the lady is a queen.

Speaker 1:          02:43:55       I think like he has like a, like a book out about being a cross dresser. He's do a whole show where he would like cross dress this guy and he's like a famous crossdresser for vegas. Like one of those guys were like, you really didn't see him or hear about them anywhere else. But If you're in vegas like frank marino, you'd see his name on these calves, like the little triangle that sits on top of the cab. You know what I'm talking about? That the little billboard they have that they ran out and uh, so dice had that room was like the upstairs room. It's a larger room and we went to see it were howling like little school children and then the after it was over we were hanging out backstage and I was like, holy shit. I'm backstage with dice. Like I was thinking about like being a kid and listening to his. It was a cassette. Yeah. My rules was just dice. I think the first one was just dice, you know, and I was listening to it. This girl I was dating, we were crying, laughing. We thought it was so funny because back then it was like so shocking what he was saying.

Speaker 3:          02:44:53       Anytime time someone dismisses dice, I always go, he goes, he's having a hard time making friends. So I go to see the psycho therapist and I'm like, hey doc, I'm having a hard time making friends. You fucking cock sucker. Like if you told me that's not funny, you just don't know what's funny. That's funny. Well, he, you know, if you know his story that that dice part was a character. Yep. Oh yeah. No, I mean just from being a fan, but I heard him on your thing to tell the whole story and everything, but it's weird. It's weird that he acknowledges that being a character and still in a weird way chooses to live as the character. He likes it. He likes being. That guy looks were in wrestling sort of a fucking joey. Joey buttafuoco sweatshirts and shit. He was the cut weightlifting gloves.

Speaker 3:          02:45:36       Oh, you're could do flashdance flashdance shirts used to wear the gold's gym jacket everywhere. It's great. The way he came out on that, uh, the one he did in the round. The special. Yeah. Was just the headband with the big feather, like staying alive hair. Will you ever hear him talking about how he tried to move back to brooklyn to. Oh, it's hilarious. Yeah. He just tried to move back with those animals. Don't like, like after he became the dice man, I'm going to go back to the neighborhood, get put up a fence and hide behind me. He can't. It's the same hanging around with those people. It's an interesting. I'd be curious to find out if larry the cable guy, like he's like, hey, hey babe, I gotta run to the hardware store or whatever. You know, I'm sure it doesn't do that, but whatever I have to go out for, if he has to go throw in like a sleeveless flannel shirt, he can go back.

Speaker 3:          02:46:27       I mean he's like a tucked in shirt guy. Well he that is a complete and total dan whitney. But does he, I mean he did. He almost committed to living his life. Now is larry the cable guy? He sort of passed the test too. I mean if he ever went out as dan whitney or did an interview on the view, he's one of the few real characters in standup was like if he went on the view. I don't know why I keep saying the view. If you went on the jimmy fallon show, the tonight show and he went on his dan whitney, it would probably blow his whole fucking thIng. Well, it isn't that what happened when you can almost pinpoint the change in diocese career trajectory was when he cried in our centennial hall. He humanized himself too much, whIch some people probably thought it was a cool thing, but when he cried about like, you know, dice man supposed to come out and be like, you know, they were taking a movie out of the theater that was as beef and he got teary eyed, but if before he sees, you know, dice is supposed to come out and be like fuck you don't see my movie.

Speaker 3:          02:47:20       Huge watts. But he cried or sydney hall and it was real. It was a genuine moment and that's just, you know, that's not who he is. But I think he was also under some insane pressure. Like if you don't remember what it was like back then, like there was so many people that were angry to meet me and he had like some hateful comedy. Yeah, lIke the things that he was making, like the way he was making fun of it. It's like if you go back and listen to like eddie murphy raw, if you go back and see some of the gay stuff, like it was like really aggressively anti gay, like the comic strip in New York. I've told us on so many radio shows, but it does make me laugh that how things have changed and no one comes down with eddie murphy ever for this stuff, but they have to have is gold albums on the wall and the first one track for just called faggots and then track one on the next album is causa says faggots and then parentheses says revisited that we didn't cover it all in the first go around.

Speaker 3:          02:48:20       Well it's in that way like social justice warriors as it were a kind of important because that's the only reason why a lot of thIs change has taken places because of how outraged people got. Like if people just kept quiet about it back then. So in a way like a lot of the, the old like taking it too far, like sort of bounces back and it has a healthy middle. You know what I mean? Like in some ways like there's always going to be like the far left, but in a lot of ways the far left tempers the far right. It's like, because like the standard, it'd be, it changes, it moves back and forth, like if you, if you let people go and, and you know, be as racist and homophobic and as hateful as they want and don't do anything about it. They kind of never realized that where they're doing it shitty. But because of

Speaker 4:          02:49:08       the blowback, like dice all that crying and everything that he did, that's probably a direct result of blowback. Like he's probably like, he was constantly experiencing people that were protesting. Remember he got kicked off of mt for, for lIfe. And I remember kurt loder saying about how unfunny it was, and this is not like unfunny to who to you. Okay. I guarantee you if he did that late night at the comedy store, he would fucking crush. So like, are you recognizing this as a character or do you think there's a real person who's saying these real things and you don't think there's any comedy in this, this play that he's putting on, which is essentially he's pretending to be this soulful guy. Oh, you cock sucker like this. He's going to fuck a guy's chicken in front of them. It's obvious that he doesn't really mean.

Speaker 4:          02:49:51       I mean it's like five minutes left. So he's doing. There's some craziness to it is. I mean it's a character. I mean, is that, is there a difference between that character in the bad guy character in a movie where the guy's going to run around killing people or raping people or is there a difference? I mean it is just fiction. Like how come we don't hold the actor responsible because the actor didn't write it. If he wrote it and he wanted to be, the bad guy would be. We'd be upset at them. No, it's like for that kind of comedy, but I mean, but there's also, you don't have to do a character to say. I feel like I feel like the entire disclaimer of everything goes to, like I said earlier, it's like there's a laughing microphone behind you on a wall. Like we're not.

Speaker 4:          02:50:31       You know what I mean? Like I'm not addressing, you know, the state of the state of the union. You know what I mean? Like I'm up here telling you like, it's clearly. That was always my thing about, uh, with the taj, the lady getting so mad. It's like, do you believe for one split second that daniel tosh is pro rape and as slipped through the cracks to find himself massive television success? do you believe that? That doesn't happen? It doesn't happen. That would have reared its head before. It's not what they're saying. What they're saying is they found a green light. They found a green light to be outraged and you know, also some people way more sensitive than others, you know, being called out in front of all those people have. And everybody laugh aT what he said to her probably sucked for her.

Speaker 4:          02:51:10       She decided that she was, for whatever reason, she was justified and proving our point or making her point or expressing herself, which you know, you should be allowed to express yourself, but the idea that he's supposed to apologize for that. Like if you look at what it was on paper and then they hear comics agreeing with them, that was just disappointing. But your outrageous supposed to come at like oppression, injustice, whatever semester you're supposed to like rage against the art. You know what I mean? Like in a clear, the creatives fucking around situation where someone's just fucking around. IT's clear he's adlibbing. This is not a thought out piece. You know where he's advocating a woman, a random woman getting raped for no reason other than the klan rallies. What I'm saying, it's there. You're in an environment. If this is what it is, well you know what man?

Speaker 4:          02:51:53       Some people be really happy if everybody was exactly like them. If everybody had the same sensibilities, sensibilities, sensitivities, and everybody had the same ideas about what's important to talk about, what you can't talk about, what's taboo, what's okay. You know, there's plenty of people out there that agree and disagree and they're fucking going at it back and forth. That's what's fascinating. That's fascinating about trying to find out where's the middle ground, like how much of it is me being crazy? How much of it is me just tapping into one mindset with whatever thing you support or disagree with anything, whether it's the style of comedy that people do or the kind of music that people are into. Some fucking kid got arrested because he took some lyrics to a song and put it up, put the lyrIcs up as a tweet and they arrested him because it was like some fucking crazy.

Speaker 4:          02:52:40       You're right. Some song about school shootings. Oh, it was going to say it wasn't for like the actual copyright of the song. You're saying? No, no, no, he. They came. They arrested him because he tweeted some in the band. I forget what the show's almost over. I forget what the band's name was that came to his defense, but they're like, this is the lyrics to a song. It's like an anti school shooting song, you know, but it's like talking about like where this all comes from the rate. I don't know if it's an anti schools shooting song, but it's just a song and it's coming from like the rage of like where, where, where's this guy feeling? what is this guy doing? This guy tweeted this. These lyrics, like if you tweet something from a movie about like kill them all, let god sort about like, does that mean I'm going to go out and kill people?

Speaker 4:          02:53:20       I mean gus van sant and made a hole basically a columbine movie. Yeah, right. Do. If I remember he did that movie though. we added in for some reason was before they went to do the murder, they just got in the shower together and made our elephant. He just added that in there before they went to go shoot. It was all the same thing like filming themselves and planning the whole thing for weeks and getting the guns together and then right before school that morning they just hopped in the shower and started making out the two dudes. Nothing about that ever in the real story. That was how he made it. Like, you know, oh no, this isn't the columbIne story these kids were making out in the shower first. Wow. That's pretty clever of him. And on that note, big jay oakerson. Thank you very much brother.
