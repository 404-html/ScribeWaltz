Speaker 1:          00:00:05       No headphones. I'd rather not have that gene. Grazie no, because I learned that, I learned that the hearing my own voice in my head makes, makes me focus on it and I don't want to focus on the sound of my voice. I want to focus on your thoughts. I'm focusing on, Ooh, it's like blowing out in my head and all this shit's going on. That's smart.

Speaker 1:          00:00:26       What's up? Oh, we're talking about whether or not you should have headphones on or not have headphones on. Don't are we up? No. If you're hearing the audio recording in this, what's happening is we switched to a new tri caster. We were having problems with our old one to tri caster is the machine that allows Jamie to switch cameras and put everything up on the Internet and hopefully includes skype so we could get some people from like getting signal, but there's no video showing. Hmm. Are we going to restart? I don't know. I'm trying to make sure that that's actually true. Sorry. It's okay. Uh, we might have to restart. Folks would try and live while we're going live with some new shit. But I want it. I want people on Youtube. Is it audio? But no video. I don't know why I figured that out. Ladies. Gentlemen, if you are just staring at a blank screen, would you have to shut this? Showed down to get the video back to it should work, but all right, just do a double camera. A two shot. So you're never going to be okay now. Is it live now?

Speaker 1:          00:01:30       Tech motherfucking, they would suck. It would suck if like we did back in half an hour. It turns out none of it got picked up or we did a whole shore. Camera's going on youtube right now for sure. It just, they don't see us right now. He's trying to fix that motherfucking dollar. Gee, we were having problems with our old tri caster crashing a lot. So we've got a new tri caster, but it turns out that, what is it that doesn't match up? What part is wrong? The control panel. It should be okay. Hey everybody. Oh Shit. Oh Shit. Um, what were we just talking about? We're talking about material, headphones, headphones. Oh, listening to yourself and the headphones. What I think of is though, it makes me like I close out the outside world. Totally. And I just lock in on the conversation. Yeah, it's only psychological.

Speaker 1:          00:02:21       But if you will watch, if he puts up a video, it'd be nice to hear it and then you brought your head and you have to put the headphones on. I just feel like when that's on, it's just like I pay more attention to not talking over people too. Can't stand the sound of my voice. So hearing you, thank you. Thank you. But I can't stand the sound of it and I, I hear enough. I don't need it blasting in my ears as I talked. Then I focus on it and then I think that's a good get depressed. It's a good quality to, he hate your own voice because voice, he would listen to it all the time like, Ooh, you know how hard it is to listen to my standup. That's tyree hard for everybody. It's death. It kills me. But I, but I always

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       hear your voice. You've got to listen to your shit. You got to go back and edit, you got to edit your shit. And I'm like, I don't want to listen to my self. I just, I want to put every, uh, every time I go up on stage behind me, I don't want to go back. But I know that's not the right thing to do. You, you get a, you take a lot of time out of the development of a joke process if you just listened to the previous versions of it. Cause like I have this new bit that I'm doing right now. Um, and I have like three different versions of it and it's not right now. It's very shaky. It's very shaky. It goes one way, it goes the other way. Sometimes it gets a big laugh. Sometimes it's just, it's just clunky and I've got to figure out which one's the right formula.

Speaker 2:          00:03:38       So the only way to do that really is to listen to how I did it. Right. And then play it back and then write it out. I'll listen to how I said it and I'll write it out. And then I'll think about like what would, I would be thinking if I was sitting there listening to this or if someone was saying this, you know what, I anticipate what they're saying with the punchlines are going to be beforehand. Because if you do that takes a lot out of it. You know? It's got to find a way to sneak it in. You've got to find a way to make it where it really relates recordings or ever have an uh, an old bit that you like an old one from like 10, 15 years ago that you'd think like, damn, I should have added that adding shit to it today.

Speaker 2:          00:04:15       Oh yeah man, if you kept going, that's like the argument like already had a good point about that. He was like, if you just keep adding to your bits and making them better and that's why you don't want to release a special, you could have used that same creativity to come up with new bits instead of doing the same old bits for 10 years. You could have used that. You know, cause there's some guys that think that like if you got those old old, old bits there, Samurai swords, man, they'd just been hammering down and Polish type this, they have this rhythm to them. You're like Jesus Christ. Like I remember, um, I did, uh, uh, did a special once and I rent, I didn't have like hardly any new material and so there's like 2009 inch or something like that. So I did some of my old old shit from like 1,999 tiger bit.

Speaker 2:          00:05:05       No, no, no. It was uh, some other stuff. What I didn't, I didn't do that, but when I retired that bit, I retired that but bringing that, you can always bring that back, bring that back. It's over. But uh, but I remember thinking, damn, these are these old 10 year old bits. And I had for like literally 10 years before I did my first recording. I started in 88 and I recorded in like 99 so almost 11 years for actually recording anything there are so tight because I had been, I'd never done them on anything so I could do them all the time. Yeah, I do. I'm on the road or just they would just, Yup, Yup. Yeah. You learn how that path, you got a fucking Ninja. It's unconscious. Yeah. Yeah. I love your description of what you were talking about, tying your shoes like you know how many tire shoes you don't think this loops going in here and this is going here and then I'm going to bring it here and then he just like that you wouldn't even

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       be able to eat. You couldn't even teach it to someone over the phone rings and it's teaching me over the phone and be like, I got to do it a few times first and figure out what the hell I'm doing because I don't even know what I'm doing. I have no idea what I'm doing when I talk about shoes and I do it every day. My son, when he learned to tie her shoes like maybe six months ago, it was, he never wanted to, he's like, he wants to do everything. He wants to decide where we eat every day, but he doesn't want to tie his own shoe laces. So, um, we finally made him, he, you know, and he was happy. He was struggling with it. And I use that as an opportunity to, to show him how you can master anything. Anything that you're having trouble with.

Speaker 3:          00:06:33       Go look right now you're having trouble that you could do what he could do it, but he, he struggles. So one day you're going to do it like Daddy, like, oh daddy does it. I'm not even looking at my shoes. Look and I do it and go boom. And he's like, I got to look at that crazy. Isn't that crazy? I'll do it again. Look my other shoe and I do. And he's like, Whoa, how'd you do that Daddy? That's like magic. And I go, I go, you can do it. To Watch one day you'll go do it and you're not even going to look. So like the next day he's trying not to look. He's like, Daddy, I'm not looking. Look, hoodies, he struggled, but now he's got it that then now I could use that, that whole story that he won't forget it. Go. Remember that.

Speaker 3:          00:07:15       Remember when you had trouble tying your shoes and remember how good you can look how you are now this is the same thing, whether it's gymnastics or break dancing or Jujitsu, karate, whatever we do, it's, it's the same exact thing. Your body is magic. You just got to tell it a thousand times and then if I only listens and it'll do it itself. I thought about that today. Not Today, but like now look, if someone, if I had to learn today how to do like a three 60 roundhouse kick. Yeah. At 50 years old I'd be like, what? What am I going to do? Yeah. I'd be like, what are you doing? But when I do it, it just like, it's just something I've done my whole life. Just Push, you know, it's like a dance and your bits, like you were talking about like I bits that you've been like your Noah's Ark bit was so god Damn Tigers, we were on the road, you know, back back in the day we were on the, you know, if you went on the road, I hung out with you.

Speaker 3:          00:08:10       I went on the road and you know, every, if you weren't on the road, we were at the comedy store every weekend. You weren't on the road. So I saw your, your act over and over and over to the point where I wasn't listening to the jokes no more. I was listening to the audience reaction. That was what was entertaining. I got to sit through another hour of your shit. So for me, I, uh, I started, uh, being entertained by the audience. Like, which jokes work and, and it's very, it's fascinating when, you know, there's women out there, they'd go out there and they had to drag their husband out. He didn't want to go out. He wanted to stanch cause we, you never take me out. And she dragged him out. He spent a lot of money there. They're buying money, they're buying drinks, she

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       wants to make sure that they have a great time. So there's always like 10 of those wives that dragged their husbands out and they just want a lab. So it's, they're, they're laughing at stuff that isn't the punchline. And you, you, you, uh, there was so many things that you would say that just, just the way you set them and wasn't, it wasn't the, the joke at all, but there'd be like four chicks for just laugh and they're like ready to laugh, you know? Well, people that love standup comedy, you definitely can get into like certain rhythms, but then you can, it's like everything else, right? Like you, you like one level of comedy, like one kind of comedy, but then you see a bunch of comedians and then the original stuff that you liked you'd think sucks. Oh yeah. I used to think comic view was the funniest shit.

Speaker 1:          00:09:40       I was obsessed with coffee. My whole life was all about music. But my, my two side things, we're fighting. I love boxing. Ever since I was a kid. I was a huge, gigantic box and fan. Then I got into the UFC, but uh, and then comedy, it was a, all I taped all I tape at home on my vcr was comedy specials and Tuesday night fights any kind of boxing. And it was just comedy, comedy and fights where my hobby and music was the goal. That was my life. I take comm anytime comicview was on that I have which ones? Comic view. It was all black. Is that bet? Yes. Yes. Is that the one that deals you will use to host? Okay. And, and uh, you know, uh, you know, live at the Apollo, the def comedy jam. I was the biggest fan of black comedy.

Speaker 1:          00:10:31       The biggest fan. I mean, you know, right away. And then you look back at like some of those, the standups after hanging out with you though and all, I started going, Oh shit. Okay. That's load up all the, a lot of those guys who are low level, well it's just, there's, there's premises that just get, you know, there's, there's guys out there like bill burr or Dave Chappelle or the real high level guys that are seeing things and then they're commenting on things and they're pointing things out that maybe other people didn't notice. Then there's other people that are doing bits because they know other people have done bits on that subject successfully. So it's not totally stealing, but they're not really being creative. They're just like trying to recreate some mat. There's a few guys that do that. Like you, you hear them and you go, man, you know that Bill Hicks did a bit about that.

Speaker 1:          00:11:20       Like you know that this guy did a bit about that. Like I see what you're doing. Like you're trying to like read, like you don't have your own original point. A lot of those shows were like that. They were just trying to make it, cause it was the comedy boom man. Well you're talking about was like there was a comedy tv boom that included evening at the Improv. MTV, half hour comedy hour spotlight, lot spotlight live on vh one some Friday night thing they had on Fox that uh, used to be at the laugh factory. They still have a police show. It was crazy. There was so much comedy, it was out of control,

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       but there was a lot of guys that just didn't belong in the business yet. I mean, I couldn't say that it couldn't eventually have broke, but they were basically like, did you ever notice, hey like there's a lot of those fucking guys where they would like, hey and there's a Goddamn wild kingdom plan out my live in Rome. Like they had this like comedy rhythm that they would do, but they didn't have shit to say. But it's still worth a lot of those guys were doing comedy to get a Sitcom. They weren't tracking, they didn't really want to do comedy. Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. They thought it'd be easier if they did it that way. Well, there was a lot of actors that I talked to about it. They're like, Hey Matt, for me it's real hard to get auditions. And he goes in for the longest time, I'd sit around and watch you guys get development deals and I'd be like, fuck that.

Speaker 3:          00:12:38       These guys don't even act. And then I realized like, why am I complaining? Why don't I just do what they do? How hard could it be? Yeah, it's hard. It's so easy. Sam Aaa did a special last week at the viper room and Hollywood man, we've known Sam forever. I don't know. I have known him for 15 years or something like that. Maybe longer. God Damn Dude, God damn this exam special. It was his first special, you know, it took them 10 years to get his shit together. But holy fuck, that hour slammed beautiful. She did is a viper two washes. That's a great place to film a special man. It was. I stayed for both shows. He did. You know when you film you do too, like you know, just in case something goes wrong and he would do some stuff to, it was weird. I've never seen a comic before.

Speaker 3:          00:13:27       He fuck up a bit and go, wait a minute, let's do that one again and then start again and do that like three times. He just wanted to make sure it was perfect. You know what I mean? Because the response was so great. The he was just on stage. He couldn't even believe it. He couldn't, everybody was dying in Edwards was there. Beautiful. Yeah, it was, he, it was, it's really good to see him, uh, blossom. I think that, you know, based on the Netflix specials that I see on average three minutes at a time, I mean a lot of bad ones, they're just putting out comedy specials left and right. My random dudes you never heard of, and a lot of, a of a lot of super vanilla, Netflix, comedy specials, Vanilla, like they're not going beep, beep. There's the little bit of that going on.

Speaker 3:          00:14:11       And there's also, I think people need to fill more shows. I think they're just filming one show sometimes. Sometimes too. I really think if you can afford each should do for Ricky Gervais is his new one. I was never a giant fan of, has never really paid attention to him. Like Ricky Gervais'. Then you do like cartoons or something like that. His new special on Netflix. That one is a grand slam. He's fucking good. Yeah. Oh yeah. That's awesome. Can you see Chappelle's Oh yeah, those are great. Yeah. How about the one in the belly row about, I mean I was there for that one. Do you remember how we ended that shit? Basically telling people exactly why he went to Africa. That's pretty crazy. That took balls as dangerous shit. Well he's really knows fuck. I mean cat willy, he's doing a specialist pretty good too.

Speaker 3:          00:14:59       I didn't like that one as much. I didn't like it as much as I liked his other ones. He spent the first 20 minutes on Jacksonville cause that's where he filmed it and I thought, you know, okay, I see what he's doing. But he had some, I thought he had some pretty good stuff considering that, you know, all the crazy stuff he went through. I thought maybe he'll never be back and he's just going to be like insane or whatever. But he did. He did come back and he is, I'm a big fan of his bolt, salt stuff. Some of the best. Oh my God. The pimp chronicles. Come on. Yes. Katt Williams. Katt Williams was a, is one of the guys that if I'm just, I don't have shit to listen to in my car, I just put youtube and just Katt Williams, just some random bit.

Speaker 3:          00:15:39       I, if I don't have anything to go, he's like, he's a Goto. Yeah, he's a Goto for sure. It's a good time, man. Good time for you. And now the comedy store's unfucking believable. It's nothing like we used to hang out there every day and the early 2000 and 2000 2001 before 10th planet was even a thought. My life consisted of deejaying at strip clubs for money at home, trying to make it, you know, in music and hanging out with you doing comedy, you know, it's crazy. That was crazy. And you think about that, pleasure is always half empty. Yes it was. It was like a dying dinosaur. It was ready to go and shit was ready to go. And then when you add that men see a shit and you left man, that the place was, it was like, how is it surviving like right there on sunset, such prime at the prime spot.

Speaker 3:          00:16:25       You could put a giant hotel there. How's that place not going to get knocked down? And then when you came back, I remember asking you a couple of times and that, that seven year absence or whatever it was going, do you ever get to go back to the comedy store? Because I wanted you to to go back and you were like, fuck that. I ain't called back. You were like really? Like, you know, you felt like you got really screwed by them and you did. Those mother fuckers turned their back on you at the comedy store and took that dude side and now looking back, they know they made a big mistake. So you were like, you standing in Goddamn ground like fuck that. I'll go to the ice house. So I'll go to Improv, fuck the congress store. And then you came back man.

Speaker 3:          00:17:00       And it's in, it's like, uh, a different world. Literally a different world. Like, it's fucking booman is selling out every goddamn night. Bolt rooms are packed. It's like, uh, it's like, it's unbelievable. Like you couldn't, nobody would believe that shit. It's so alive at the comedy store. People just go there like during the week, like it's a big event. Tuesday nights, Tuesday, Tuesday nights sometimes they have two sold out shows. Khurram and the original, the comedy chaos Tuesdays. Yeah. The father's never been like that, but no, it was buck. They opened up all those, those old decrepit brooms and made a bark. Like they're opening up a everything's, there's all these bar that used to be a video room. That back bar is the best he can get away from people and chill out back there. Yeah. That she wasn't around back in the [inaudible]. That was probably the whole smoking car door in the back now.

Speaker 3:          00:17:49       Yeah. But he goes out back to south side, the outside bar. It's booming. There's always people there drinking. It's, it's crazy weird. Right. The Bar's always mobbed. It helps nuggets. And then across the street, House of Blues, they knock that shit down. Like when you walk outside and you go up that ramp, you know that ramp is and the parking lot next door and get that views insane. Yeah, the view's incredible. Like they have the best view in the world. Comedy stores like, um, it's like guns and roses slam big and the fucking eighties disappeared for 20 fucking years. 25 years. And now guns and roses not only made a comeback, but they're bigger than ever. They're bigger than ever. It guns and roses. Unbelievable. Everywhere they play, they're just sell it out and it's in, I saw him in Mexico City and got completely blown away. I was like Mexico City, we there for seminar. I was there for combat. You Tony's fight.

Speaker 3:          00:18:48       That's crazy. You saw. Yeah, that brings us, oh, it was incredible. And I was never a giant guns and roses fan. I respected them. I like their songs and shit. But you know, as a kid, once one of your friends claims them as their favorite and now they can't be your favorite. So it's like some stupid shit. It's some stupid shit. Like my friend Matt, he claimed guns and roses and I'm like, okay, cause we wouldn't, if, if he bought a guns and roses record, I would just tape it. I wouldn't buy it too. So whoever actually own that, the master, you know what I mean? That was their band, you know what I mean? Fuck you. That's my band. It's like a sport. It really is. But you have a bunch of teams like yours. My band was kiss cause I, even when everyone made fun of him, I'm the only one who admitted they still liked him for a while.

Speaker 3:          00:19:31       Then you get like that with boxers to no, with boxing was different. It was boxing is all racist. It's completely racist. And it's okay. Boxing's the only sport, it's the only sport you could be racist, black guy will not ever have generally is bummer general. It was Donald Curry getting knocked out by Mike Mcowen, Mike, Mike Tyson font. When Mike Tyson fought Gerry Cooney, every white guy, white guy did Mike Tyson. I saw what a bunch of white guys, but not anybody famous. No, not really. Um, anybody. Well, uh, Gelada coolish guy who was, that's right. That's right. But does he comes wipe? Yeah, he's from Poland. A lot of them is pretty well times the European whites. We don't think of them as American war. The animals. Yeah, we definitely, yeah, we want like Russians are always going to go for the Russian guy. So boxing is the only one.

Speaker 3:          00:20:33       Like I didn't give a fuck who the Mexican was fighting. I'm going for the Mexican. Even if I didn't know the Mexican, I already had love for him. Yeah, he wasn't Mexican and he was Panamanian. That's good enough. Right. If he was Argentinian, you know one role, Dan, remember him. I remember Argentina, that guys, if he's fighting a Mexican, I'm going for the Mexican. But if he's fighting a white guy or a black guy, I'm always going for the Latin guy. That the only sport where you could be totally racist. My best friend was black growing up and we, we both watched boxing together and he always went for the black guy. I always went for the Latin guy and it was like, it was okay. There was nothing wrong with that. Who was another a Argentinian champion that was champion before? Um, Marvin Hagler. God Damn it.

Speaker 3:          00:21:19       It's at the tip of my tongue. I cannot remember. His name was Pepino. Cuevas. Alexis are guayle. As long as there were Latin, there were Mexican to me. He was right before Marvin Hagler. God dammit. I see him. I see his curly hair. A handsome and fellow calls Mons on. Thank God I got it. It was great. Pull it up. Jamie's going to pull it up before I go. Remember [inaudible] zone was a bad mother fucker, wasn't he from Argentina? It was beautiful. Yeah. He was a tough guy, man. There was a, those are the blood and guts days of boxing. You know, Roberto Duran can be candidate lightweight, 135 pound killers. It was a different world back then, man. Those guys were tough as shit. 15 round fights is different though. I always, I was always the, I, I, there was a point where I thought generally overall just black people are way funnier than white people based on stand up comedy.

Speaker 3:          00:22:17       I was like, give, this was like a little Richard Pryor. Eddie Murphy, you know, I really believe that. And like Mexican communities. I wasn't like rooting for Paul Rodriguez. I was like, oh good. I was, I didn't, yeah, I know some people do, but I didn't. I was, I, I was, uh, you know, now he's just against the white and see him more than anything. When people found out it wasn't really Mexican, they were like, what? He's on Dorian. Ron during a German or something. Yeah. Did he ever see some Mexican? Yes. Yeah. He was like, he doesn't anymore. It was like an end. Andrew dice clay, he was kind of raised by Mexican people though. He should, he should have said that. And he said, listen, this isn't all, it's just this like, it's my character. I'll change your name. Carlis I'm calling them and see. I couldn't, we change Andrew dice clay.

Speaker 3:          00:23:03       Yeah, but that's first of all, that's like a character name, but I'm saying like saying your ethnicity, maybe Carlos. I had to put tape on my eyes and trying to save his Kareo Chan. He would be like, what? Right? You can't do that. But if you try to claim, if I tried to claim German, right, just out of nowhere, like you don't know any better, you'd never see my 23 and now maybe you did like a [inaudible] character where you're, could you do German accent? Not Arnold Schwarzenegger. Uh, that's Austrian. Oh, okay. Yeah. Um, no. I don't think I could probably do one if I may. The Arnold so easy. So like I can only do sir. I can't do trump, man. You can't do trump. No, I can't do it at all. My voice doesn't make those sounds like I'm

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       not a good impressionist. I'm just good at the ones that I can do. What does Arnold think? A trump busy. We've had this conversation before is not a bad guy. He's just a guy. Oh, that's right. He's listening. He's doing what everybody wants. He's making billions. He's fucking porn stars. And you're mad at him. This is the fucking American Jean who looks like Bro. For real though, who looks like him and fucks like he does. I, I'm a little bit more impressed with donald after all the scandals. It backfired. You guys will try and go, no Clinton on this guy. He's not trying to fuck kids so that, hey, here's a thing about it, like Roseanne Barr, they were saying that Roseanne Barr was, uh, was talking about some conspiracy theories that have been disproven. This is what some thing, cause she was talking about trump, break it up, child sex rings.

Speaker 2:          00:24:36       But he really did spend a lot of time concentrating on that and having people go out and try to break up the sex rings and sex trafficking. Like this is not something that is a conspiracy theory. This is something that he's discussed many times. It's also not a conspiracy that there's sex trafficking. So as much as you want to discount trump, here's a problem that I have with people that are on the left right now. They didn't do not looking at everything, throwing, looking at what they want to look at. He's bad for the environment. He's always lying. He cheats on his wife. He does this, he does that. They say all these things that he does bad. But when something comes up, like Roseanne says, ah, I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt because he's going after sex trafficking and then it turns out all these other people.

Speaker 2:          00:25:22       So that's conspiracy theory. That's a bullshit online. No, he said it. He's put effort into it. Like you gotta give the Guy Credit because if you don't give them credit for things that he does at are important, nobody's going to listen to you when you're criticizing them either because you, all you're trying to do is when you're not trying to look at the thing for what it really is. Yeah. He's this guy and he's not perfect person, but he did make note on many times about at wanting to break up stuff, just sex trafficking rings. You know that you're, uh, your kid is 20,000 times more likely to get kidnapped them to get shot or to school. Does that make sense? Yeah. At 20,000 it's conservative. It's probably really like 70,000, because if you go by the numbers, 800,000 to a million kids go missing every year in the United States.

Speaker 2:          00:26:08       And I looked that up though. That doesn't, I'd never found a source for that. You said that before and I looked that up and I couldn't find that. It wasn't nearly as, I read it online so it could be wrong. It cause a problem with these things, like when we say, especially if you say it, I'm like right now 2 million people are going to listen to this or whatever. The fucking knows. Even if it's a 100,100 if it's 102 hundred kids, that's more than school. One of y'all. To my point, it's more than school shootings. Like what would you rather have your, you know what's worse? I don't know what's worse. Get having your Kubrick shot at any, right. Look at this. According to the National Center for missing exploited children, citing US Department of Justice report, nearly 800,000 children

Speaker 3:          00:26:43       are reported missing each year. That's more than 2000 a day. The end. See Mec says 203,000 children are kidnapped each year by family members. Oh, family. That's a little bit of six thousand six hundred thousand. Yeah, that'd be 600,000. So what's worse has always having your kid, cause uh, cause the conspiracy theory is that there's this giant international child sex trafficking network going on that is being covered up. That's what's going on. And if you look at a Jimmy Salvo in the UK that brought a lot of light to what's going saddle savile. Yeah. That was a terrifying story. The story with him is Jimmy Savile. He's dead now. He died in his eighties at, in 2011. He was uh, uh, a super famous like Dick Clark kind of guy. He was a d, he was the host of a pop top of the pops. Um, it's like if your band got on that show, you're going to be mega.

Speaker 3:          00:27:43       He was huge. He was friends with the royal family, with the prime minister's Margaret Thatcher, Tony Blair, a picture of him. He looks disgusting. Pull up Jimmy savile. This guy looks like a child. Look at this guy. Look at this guy. I was just super fucked by that guy. Check this out. But he was 12 super, super famous and you know what he would do? He would raise money for hospitals and specifically psychiatric hospitals and he would bring the queen of England and he got all this power to raise millions for these hospitals, these mental institutions. He, that's what he prayed on it for kids, so he would, what he would do is he would, he would do so much for these hospitals that he would put himself on the board and give himself a job. They're in a position and he would hang out at these hospitals. There's all, there's at least five. There's at least 500 people that have come forward to say they've been were raped by him. When that ran a 500 people, at least it's in the thousands so that he's holding up on his neck. What does that say to me? Oh yeah, he would fix it. He worked, he worked for the BBC, super famous super, and he would, he had Christmas dinner with Margaret Thatcher Multiple Times. What does that red hat? He's got the, it looks like a maggot hat right above that. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:29:04       There's a crazy guy who it turns out he was a child rapist. Yeah. And um, that's the same thing with Sandusky and the covering Husky guy it up. The question is becoming this old dude. Yes. Because people knew they're complicit and they then trump the mystery. The mystery is how is he so tight with the prime ministers, the royal family, all these politicians, all this shit comes out when he died. Cause every time there would be an allegation while he was alive, she would just sit them down and go, what are you going to do now? I'm going to ruin your life. You better drop this shit. What are you going to do? You think they're going to come after me?

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       You know how many millions are given this hospital? So he would just shut everything down. Right. And there was all these underground covered up allegations. Did getting knighthood was a relief because it got me off the hook. What does that mean? You got me off. He was knighted. So got him off the hook. What do you think is that he got knighted when you get knighted? Could they, could they not arrest you anymore? Is that what happens? Is it like being the president? Yeah, there's a, there's a documentary on Youtube called the ninth circle. Jimmy Savile, the ninth circle. You find out why they covered it up. Why did they cover it up? Widen this agent, Dj these. It's like Dick Clark. They should've just mashed them up. Why was it all being covered up? It's fucking insane. When you find out why has it for dead bodies in general, the key dead people.

Speaker 1:          00:30:28       Why he loved fucking dead people. What'd you hear this then the nights are green. The ninth circle to watch that Jesus Christ. It's insane. It's insane. When you find out when you watch that shit dude, it is crazy that you like you're saying this and it sounds like, like it can never be possible. It sounds like it never, it could be possible that some giant television star that worked with children. It was always helping out. Children could have actually been fucking them the whole time and a bunch of them, hundreds of raping them and then people must have known. There's no way to everybody. He was killing them too. He was killing him. He was killing them, dude. They got, they found all these bodies. It's a [inaudible]. It's a big scandal in the UK. Hold up right now. Look, Jesus Christ, there's an island called Jersey island. It's owned by the Queen and look into that shit.

Speaker 1:          00:31:27       I don't even want to get that. I don't even want to get that deep into it because that I don't have a rape children as young as nine while working at BBC leaked report on veils. And this is in the independent. Yeah. How come? Why not? How come there's not the same kind of effort for this kind of stuff like there is with the um, um, the gun shooting, the Florida school shooting. Why isn't there, because that's not a big event where it's one thing where all the deaths happen in one deaths or deaths. I understand. I'm with you. I understand. But I mean this is also why people don't freak out about 500,000 people dying every year because of obesity. Like what would you, what's worse? What's worse? Having your kid get shot at a school shooting or having that motherfucker rape your daughter and multiple times and then kill it. I don't think what's worse. They're both hard. Exactly. It's horrible. What's scary is that that is being protected. Yes. There's someone that either knew about it and now he's trying to cover their ass because they knew about it. That was the thing about Sandusky. Y'All saying Guskey did the same thing. He was raping all these kids and the whole time he was running these programs for underprivileged children and helping all these orphaned kids. You've got to watch your kids, man. You got to watch a he away with abusing 500

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       children and sex with dead bodies. Whoa. Hanging out with the queen. Did this guys tight with the cooking them to God and all these little kids around him? You know what you want me to tell you why he got, why they left him alone? You do know according to the ninth circle, what does the ninth sorts, it's a documentary about the whole thing I'll cover on because everybody's doing it. They're all doing it. He was supplying everybody with kids. That's what he used the hospitals for. Well this is not a new theory. This is not a new theory when it comes to like groups of freaks. He was a pimp. He was supplying everybody with kids. This is, this is something that people have talked about, like very intelligent people that I know that have talked about in terms of like, uh, there's been stories about people that have taken politicians to like islands and shit because that's where they keep like young girls.

Speaker 2:          00:33:35       You know, I don't know why I'm looking at you jammy dude. And you know what, but there's, but someone talked to me about this and they were saying, you have to understand that if you are in a group of incredibly wealthy people and you have extreme, a desire for extreme sexual scenarios, whips and, and you can't, whatever the fuck it is, you can't young girls, you can't let anybody know about this. So people come into these people's lives that can facilitate these things and then they developed a sort of bond of silence. And this is how when this shit gets out of hand, you can get a Jimmy savile or you can get a Jerry Sandusky. They'll say one thing about [inaudible] there was like, this is not, sky was not on his own. Like he was supplying chill iceberg. Wasn't that one of the things they, that doesn't come up San Dusky Google sent Dusky was supplying children to other pedophiles because that was something that was also speculated about some of the donors that were donors to his, uh, his charities.

Speaker 2:          00:34:34       We're also somehow involved in molesting those kids. You know what a death right? Is death ride, death ride. No. Jimmy savile would supply 10, 15 boys to a certain politician. Um, he'd have a boat, he'd take them out on the boat. He couldn't, he couldn't afford to have any witnesses. So those were always the last rides. Those kids would take their called death rides. She couldn't have ways. This is from that same documentary ninth circle c, but how do they know that for a fact? You just got to watch it and, and uh, and make the, uh, conclusion. I'm not low. I'm not ruling it about to get shit back. So you got to look at him like a prosecuting attorney, not a defense lawyer. He's already a shitbag. He's already confirmed already ripping kids. What's the stop of killing? Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. I mean, that's a good point because if you're the type of person that could rate a child, what can't you do? And that's what I'm saying, right? In the UK, the numbers could be wrong, but I heard that every three seconds a child is reported missing in the UK, ever. That's 175,000 kids a year get reported missing in the, in the UK, it's a big businessman has got to be more than that. It's a Jochen's in a year. Isn't that every three seconds at 175,000 that seems low. Every three minutes. I'm sorry, 39 every three seconds. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Is Crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:36:01       Every three minutes, every three minutes. This is according to something I saw. 31 million seconds in a day. Yeah. Yeah. Um, I'm sure the numbers are probably a hundred. 175,000 isn't as big as 800,000 a year, but damn, that's, that should be pick up on all this out. What we're doing for the Florida shooting and for the shootings and what that David Hogg Guy Come on man. That that's what's scary is that people are buying all that stuff, buying all what stuff? The whole gun control propaganda. You know, it's so obvious. It's, it's, it's ridiculous. It's ridiculous thing to gun control. Propagandas it's really simple, man. It's like they've been, you have to disarm the population and that's what they're doing. And by Ann's trying to disarm it, they used to say, they used to say, oh no, we just want some restrictions and some background checks. Now they're just saying it.

Speaker 2:          00:36:59       You know, some people are saying revoke the second amendment. They're tearing the constitution. They're tearing the constitution. Those four kids, those four kids, there's a concept. They weren't, they weren't, that's not true. No, no. That's photoshop. No it isn't. Yeah. Original image that that girl was tearing. It was like a target target. Okay. Someone replaced that image with the constant. Okay, but they're essentially doing the same thing. Yeah. No, I know what you're saying. They look, first of all, they're 17 they were at a school that got shot up. Their friends died. I get it from their point of view. If I was 17 I would think, and also they got cameras in their face and everybody's paying attention to them and ever. The New York Times is interviewing on the Washington Post. Everyone's calling them up. If I was them, I'd probably be doing the same thing.

Speaker 2:          00:37:41       You would probably too, if you were in high school with those kids and all that shit went down. I don't blame them by any stretch of the imagination. I don't even blame people that are trying to revoke the second amendment. The thing that infuriates me the most is that all people want to look at is the guns. That's all they want to look at. You need to look at the mental health of individuals that are willing to fucking shoot up a group of kids. Like why? Why the fuck would someone do that? Psychiatric medications are a big one that if you bring up people roll their eyes like, oh, this again. There are massive changes to the fucking chemical composition of your brain. When you take these things, what you're capable of doing, what bothers you, what freaks you out, what you don't give a shit about.

Speaker 2:          00:38:23       When you got all these people that are on an Ssri, antidepressants and anti anxiety medication and over and over and over again. When they test these shooters, they all test positive for something. The pharmaceutical companies do not want fucking hear about this. They don't want to talk about this. Phil Hartman, my friend who got shot by his wife, she was on Zoloft. They got a settlement from zoloft. The family got a settlement from zoloft after she fucking shot him in the head while he was sleeping. This is, there's a lot going on. It's not just guns. It is crazy that that fucked up kid could get guns. It is crazy to just crazy it. The FBI went to his house two years before, but what can you do? Do you hear about the kid that they just stopped and China, the Chinese immigrant kid, they're sending back that his roommates in college, we're saying this fucking guy's stockpile and guns.

Speaker 2:          00:39:09       The cops went to visit him. He went and bought another gun and he's talking all kinds of crazy shit and everybody's nervous about him. Like he's a fucking shooter, wedded, ready to happen. Stop going to class. And that's how they sent him back because he's on a student visa. You can't not be in class. This kid was like gearing up. He was gearing up and maybe, maybe they caught it before it happened and maybe they wouldn't have like two years ago when they interviewed this, uh, the kid from Parkland now decayed. The strangest thing about the parkland shooting is the interview one of the teachers did on ABC. That's this, this doesn't make any sense to me at all. It's like she said, um, I have the video. I could send it to you, Jen. I, it's, it's less than a minute. She says, why? I opened up, I heard the, I heard shots.

Speaker 2:          00:39:57       I opened up the door. All the kids ran in the hid behind their desk and there I saw the shooter 20 feet away from me, but at first I thought he was a policeman. I'm like, what is the police doing here? He had full body armor and mask on a helmet on and was shooting. I was like, what is the cost? What are the cops doing here? That is the strangers, uh, video I've seen because possibly someone shooting at the kid. That's not what she said. She said she saw the shooter. That's right, but I mean, how long was she watching for? Right? If you're like looking out the window and you see someone that's shooting someone or shooting a gun or even holding a gun, first of all, you have to realize that people in those traumatic situations, their memory is very fucked up.

Speaker 2:          00:40:40       It's very shaky. Your brain's flooded with adrenaline. You may remember your openness suggestion. People can put things in your head and you all of a sudden think that that was a real memory that you saw. There's been like scientific studies on that and about suggestive memory and about someone can literally it, especially during periods of great duress, they can introduce ideas into your head and you will tell those ideas hours later, days later as your own and you don't even realize that they put them in your head. It's real weird memory in traumatic situations like guns, shootouts and shit like that is haywire because you're on, you're working on that reptilian part of your brain. You're down to the lowest level. Like my friend Steve Rinella got attacked by a grizzly bear. He was in a fog neck island. It's a crazy podcast. Heman. These other guys, they had killed an elk and they were packing this elk out and they left the elk by the tree while they were at their camp.

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       Then they went to go back and a baird claim the elk and this bear rushed him and he was like, the one of the ways you described to me, it's like you have an idea in your head of like what? Like an animal instinct is like, and he goes, I'm telling you, this goes way deeper than that. This goes, wait, when you really think your life is in danger, you really think it's over. You don't even exist anymore. You're moving. You have no idea what you're doing. You're you're you. You have to piece together what happened afterwards and you were barely there in the first place. You're just gone. You're gone. You see somebody else like you have no fucking idea who you even are right there. And then all these people that like I would have run in the building kicked that fucking guy's ass. You barely even know who you are. You've got this video.

Speaker 3:          00:42:18       Oh, I sent you the video, the video of that. People have to understand memory. Well, let's listen to her and then let's see if she sounds like, okay, let's hear what she says. I actually sent, sent you that the actual clips at the one. This is not it. Didn't I send, I sent you one right on your phone. This is not it though. That's, that's the lady. But I don't know when, when she's going to say let's just play it cause we don't hear it. We're not hearing it, Jamie. That's good. Dick Writing Love Letters. When the fire alarm went off, as students filed into the hallway, she heard gun fire. The killing had begun. Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:42:59       I was about two feet away from my door. All of a sudden I heard gunshots in the stairwell, which is about 20 feet away from my room. And then kids were screaming and then running back towards me and towards the end of the hallway. So I just went in this very strange autopilot mode where I pivoted on my feet. I unlocked my door and the kids just start pouring in my room. I don't know how many kids were in there, but it was pulling them and getting them in and shouting at them to get in the room. And then I suddenly saw the shooter about 20 feet from me standing at the end of the hallway, actively shooting down the hallway, just a barrage of bullets. And I'm staring at him thinking, why is the police here? This is strange cause he's in full metal garb. Helmet facemask a bulletproof armor shooting this rifle that I've never seen before.

Speaker 3:          00:43:47       Huh? I don't know. That sounds like a someone who saw something. Yeah, very good. Look at it. And then there's another video of a girl saying yeah we heard shots and we're running through the hallway and then I run into Nicholas crews and I looked at him and I told him, Mike, isn't it weird that everyone thought this was going to be you? And then he just stood there and then we ran off cause we heard more shots. Wow. That's th th it doesn't make any sense. It doesn't make any sense. And that stops those details get taken down. Those videos get taken to dive. Video's not taking down. They've been taking them down when they find him, they take, there's this people actively taken down witness testimony that doesn't go with the official narrative man. So you think that this is like a flag, like someone shot up the school food all the time.

Speaker 3:          00:44:35       That's what they do. And then they focus on it. They got it. They got bad. This Nicholas crews guy and they go, oh, we got a perfect guy. So they come in, they have a professional team, they drag a nicholas crews, they do what they gotta do. They throw him in there, arrest him and go, we got him and then everyone buys it. That's what's going on in my opinion, in my opinion. But this is a, this is a crazy opinion, right? Because you weren't there on the other side of the country I'm sure. But every time there's any sort of a mass event, some horrible event, there's always conspiracies, you know, because most these star, they're like to have a, what was going on right before this was the release of the Pfizer Document and conspiracy, you know, and the doctor was bearing that the five, the document was a document that trump released and got zero zero air play from mainstream media.

Speaker 3:          00:45:28       And it was a document that that showed that a lot of really important people in government from all the agencies were all colluding together to take down trump. And there's text messages and emails. They're going back and forth. So they all work together with Hollywood, with using Hollywood. So there's this so five's, the document was about to get dropped and everyone was saying, wait, they're they, they're backed into a corner. They're going to pull something off. Watch. Here it comes. They're going to pull out. There's going to be up shooting or something. Wait for it. Here it comes, and then boom. So as soon as it happened, the reason why conspiracy theorist are gone, that's it. And look at all the mistakes. Look at, look at all the testimony. That doesn't make any sense that they're ignoring like that. The thing, the thing that gets me is there's so many fuck ups in that shooting as a false flag.

Speaker 3:          00:46:21       We're like all these, these witness test, the witness testimony. That doesn't make any sense. That to me, I think they did it on purpose to keep all the conspiracy theorists busy because there's so much shit. It's so cheap to keep everyone away. That doesn't make any sense to keep everybody away from the Fi's document documentary. You know what? It's also possible that people that were at that shooting, their memories all fucked up because there were so many shooting people. That's a real thing, like that's 100% she sounded like she didn't know what she was talking about then since then, but that wasn't when the shooting was going down. You got to see people when you see people like right when they've seen some shit, their brains scrambled. Yeah. That's something that have to take into consideration. Especially some nice lady probably never saw anybody get shot in their lives. Probably never saw much violence. Yeah. Maybe. Maybe, I don't know. There's two, there's two sides of it. There's, there's people that believe the official story and then there's people that see it as, oh, this was the false flag to distract from the Pfizer document lists. I'm not saying that false flags don't exist. I mean you and I was discussed on this podcast in great detail is important. False flag, which is operation northwoods. Yeah. If they're willing to do that, they're willing to do

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       anything. This is also the problem when we say they operation northwoods was 1962. The question is if that's how they did business back then, which is what they did. I mean operation northwoods, they were planning on attacking Guantanamo Bay with the Cuban going to arm Cuban friendlies, have them attack Guantanamo Bay. They can sacrifice American lives. They were going to blow up a drone. Jetliner blame it on the Cubans. All this was to get us enthusiastic about going to war with Cuba. They were going to sacrifice American lives. This is 100%. They were going to lie and fake shit. Normal, which was normal empires for all countries is just a normal false flags are. It's nothing new. It's been going on since the dawn of time. False flags. That's old school. The question is, and this is for the rational person who's like, this is ridiculous. You have to wonder, is that evolved?

Speaker 2:          00:48:19       Right? Everything evolves. The, the, uh, the way we use technology evolves, the way we use literature evolves, the way we use TV evolve, everything evolves. Does that evil corruption in government evolved to or does it just somehow or another get snuffed out because of the light? They don't buy that. I don't, I don't buy that. If you look at all the different things that we've shown that there's collusion in, just look at the fact that someone like Hillary Clinton can run for president while she was making hundreds of thousands of dollars giving speeches to banks, like when she was in that debate with Bernie Sanders and Bernie Sanders was like released his transcripts. Tell us what you said. Tell us what you said to those Nice Bank are people that give you a half a million dollars or whatever the fuck they gave you. Like that's insane to think that some, I was like, listen dude, she is so fucking entertaining.

Speaker 2:          00:49:04       We're going to give her $250,000 for an hour. It's worth it. Trust me. I know where in the banking business and I know we make money with money. You know what I mean? We're all about money. We know the value of money. We're in the banking business. This lady talking is worth a quarter million dollars. It's the best. She's going to go up there. She's going to knock your socks off. So she's amazing. She's funny. She's hilarious. She's amazing. Her speech is super well and she stands up there on the podium and just knocks your fucking Dick into the dirt. Was this Hillary Clinton gets humiliating $7,000 less than snookie for speech at rutgers as her story grows old. Wow. So she got, she got a price slash to $25,000 I think they're kind of thrown under the bus. Her standard fee was $200,000 per speech, but some folks suggested it may be her broken record that set the recent slash price of 25,000 she made so much money off the Clinton Foundation. She's fine. She's like, I'll do it for a thousand did I got fucking 100 million from that Haiti earthquake? Are you getting the but those people, people like her. I think one of the things in the back of their head is always the potential litigation. I think they're always want to stockpile legal funds cause someone could always come after them. If you stop and think about the Clinton Foundation and like, you know, if you had 100 million and now

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       you have, you know, 75 million, you're like, oh my God, we gotta I gotta take some odd jobs that shit. Do some speeches and Saudi Arabia, listen, it should be illegal for someone to run for president. If someone who they could influence in a positive way with passing things and signing legislature, if you pushing things forward using their influence, if someone is in a position that they could do that for a company and that company wants him keeping you $200,000 to talk, that's just fucking insane. That's insane. That's bribery. That's are you saying that it's worth $200,000 if she sucked every dick in the room, it wouldn't be worth $200,000 right. There's no way. Who's going to pay $1,000 for a Hillary Clinton Bro job other than for the story. I think she didn't get a lot of money for blow job. Do you think so? I think fucking alt right guys.

Speaker 3:          00:51:17       A disparate fucking battle on down dude than Devin Bu cockies. You know what I mean? She'll do do a bit cocky for getting this. I feel this feels like a disrespectful term we're taking with Hillary. I'm sorry. As a person, forget about it. As a woman, just as a politician, no one should be, it should just be impossible. There's enough spirasi theory that, uh, Hillary Clinton's father, he wrote him, I, I'm assuming he's, he's not alive anymore, was a huge Jewish mob boss who is responsible for opium going into Chicago. I don't know if that's real, but it makes sense to me. It look what we know for a fact that some politicians have run drugs before the bushes. But here's the biggest one. The fucking Kennedy's open, open, flat out. I mean, it was moonshine at the time. But guess what? That's drugs. That's as much of a drug worse than wheat.

Speaker 3:          00:52:13       It's worse. Way Worse. I mean that this how the Kennedy family made their money. We needed a president to run marijuana. How cool would that have Tommy Chong for president, Jimmy Carter was like, he was just doing, he just stuck to marijuana drug. John for President Tom, he's got, he's got diversity on his side. Cheech could be the running main cheech and Chong, 2020 guys get on it. I have you on the podcast support you 100%. If you think about all the stuff the government was willing to do over over time, like, like, you know, uh, operation northwoods for instance. Uh, they were willing to kill their own people. Uh, um, you know, there's a lot of corruption, bribery, lot of shit in the government. Right, right. Yeah. If you had to equate that to one person, you could say the u s government is kind of like John Gotti.

Speaker 3:          00:52:57       Right, right, right. Kinda right. And you're a little bit, a little bit, I killed some people. Yeah, for sure. It's on people. If they cross him off boss. A lot of, yeah, a lot of scamming going on, a lot of stealing. He's Kinda, he's Kinda like a politician. He's kind of like the overall, you know, how could anybody trust anything? He would say. Yeah. And anytime someone would say, hey dude, like some John Gotti nerd came up, he goes, dude, you know, he killed 15 people one night in my annual, you wouldn't did, where's the proof? Where's the proof? Show me. He wouldn't say that you would go, you believe in. And even if it wasn't true, he's like, [inaudible] still a douchebag. He's still a criminal. He's still killing people. So yeah, you were wrong about that. I was actually, you know, traffic content and it wasn't, you know, but still, you know what I mean?

Speaker 3:          00:53:41       People just naturally, when it comes to the government, they know how corrupt they are. They know that they're willing to kill their own people. They know that the politicians aren't waking up going, how am I going to make everyone's lives better? So all those speeches you here, you know them trying to like hell. They're not thinking about helping their thinking about keeping, keeping their power. They're the criminals. That's what's going on. So while they're in a business and this business has criminal rules, they've allowed them to have these criminal rules. It's all about how can every politician, they're all trying to get ahold of that. That tax money. Oh, that's the, that's the, the, the, the end game right there. You get that tax money. You're never, you could steal tax money and people were never going to come after you. You Steel Corporation money, you're going to die.

Speaker 3:          00:54:26       I didn't even get mad if he still tax and the tax man, this has just come up with the bills. Come up with something. Anything. Just anything. Okay. Uh, W W we this bills to, to build a churches and uh, we're going to help children around the world and we're going to find a cure for leukemia and that. Fuck, yeah, cool. Boom. It's really easy. You just gotta make up some shit. You got to pretend that you're going to help people. Oh, this one's the affordable housing act. You know, we can help more people like that. Politicians really trying to help with, they're trying to do is rip off tax money. That's it. It's all allocated. Move it, move it to the people that they wanted to have it too. Yeah. It's a, it's a dirty business. I'm open to it. Then it changes and the seagulls.

Speaker 3:          00:55:06       I, I think the way we are being programmed in doctrinated, I think it's genius. It's working so God damn well because it works on really smart people. There's intelligent people all over the guys. Damn. We're invested in the system. They, everybody's invested in this indoctrination that the school system man, you know, school really is designed to get your, take the kids from the family, like the kids believe their teachers more than their own parents and they, it that the state takes your kid. They're there. They're raising their kids. Yeah. It's, it's ridiculous, man. I think most of what's going on in schools is not that. I think most of it is people that are just totally apathetic about teaching people. They don't give a fuck. Most of these people that are teaching, they're doing it as a job. There's a lot of terrible fucking teachers out there and they don't get paid anything.

Speaker 3:          00:55:59       And it's 30 conspiracy taught, not taught. And told how to teach and what to show. They're not like, okay, just give us your own versions of English together with educators, they get together to try to figure out a way to get people to learn these things, but it's uninspired. That's more, more than anything. There's no money to a conspiracy theory is that the Rockefeller, John Rockefeller and Carnegie designed the school system to slaves and to separate the family. What's the conspirators career? The conspiracy theories they designed to create workers, right? People that are slaves to the system. The conspiracy theories, they openly said, we don't, we don't need any more philosophers are geniuses. We got an offer that we, we, we got that and we got science right here. We've got jenny sites. You need come to us like w when was the last, what was the last science?

Speaker 3:          00:56:49       Great scientific discovery like in the last 40 years that wasn't government funded. Like there's, there's no what their, who's funding these studies. Why do you think that they're government funded? Like some new shit they come out with? Uh, I don't know. See, I don't know. Yeah, I don't know. No one can name anything. I don't know what. I mean, we'd have to go over some of the styles, but I'm sure a lot of them are not government. I'm assuming that most scientists are getting paychecks from the government. I'm just assuming that I'm just, I'm, I'm assuming that most scientific datas is not, it's coming from a bunch of scientists who are getting grants and they can't say crazy shit. They got it. And there, you know, I sent you that one email that one guy was telling me that there, uh, he worked for a team of scientists and they're working for pesticide company and they're told to the go, we're going to do some studies here and we want it to look like this and let's keep doing it.

Speaker 3:          00:57:41       Keep doing the studies until when we got, oh, that's the worst they can do. That is insane. That's insane. They keep doing study until they get the results they want and then they don't publish the bad studies. The only published the good studies and this is what you have done. It seems like there's basically in a nutshell, like three kinds of science. There's, there's the sign like pseudoscience. It's like it's pretend science, but for sure it's not real. It's false science. Pseudo science and then there's the scientific facts like for sure [inaudible] it's a scientific fact that I can get on the Internet with my iphone. I don't need to read a study about it and say, oh, I didn't. I actually can. I know it. My friends know it. That's a scientific fact and other scientific is my car will take me to point a to point B to point c over and over and it may break down every now and then.

Speaker 3:          00:58:26       That's a fact. That's us. The science of my car. I believe that science, scientific facts and then there's a science that you, you, you have to take the scientist's word for it because there's no way that you can verify that if you have to take, do you have to have faith in science? That's like a religion. But scientism, hold on a second. What are you talking about? Like what particular kind of, any kind of science, whether it's a medical science, if you, you have, you have a choice to believe in science that you can't verify yourself. You could believe it you, but you'll have to believe it. You could say experts in the field verify it. All the people that understood all the bop with all the, we, all the science that we know that though had been, has been corrupted. Just the big ones. Uh, sugar science, uh, tobacco science, marijuana science, vaccine signs. We know for sure all just those four that there's been a lot of corruption and so it's hard to trust. So when someone comes out and especially the government and NGOs, yeah, our scientists, scientists say that it's safe

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       and effective. You got to be like, damn, I don't know about that. I'm not going to just take your fucking word for it. You know what I mean? You guys are criminals. You're John Gotti and you guys are saying, you guys are saying that this is safe and effective. I don't know about that. You know, maybe it is. I hope it is, but I don't know. I don't know cause they can't prove it for myself. Oftentimes drugs that get past as being safe and they turn out to not be exactly the problem with these studies. Exactly. This is like when we were talking about earlier with that, nobody wants to discuss the idea that psychotropic drugs have played a part in school shootings. The salt, a very recent thing with human beings, the reason spike, but they're talking about the recent spike in shootings, even wet by people they know we're mass shooters.

Speaker 1:          01:00:03       Those people are almost all on these pills, but this, these pills are very recently big. So when you're talking about, yeah, so when you're talking about just the history of human beings involved in mass killings, it's really recent. Craze is ramping up. It's going crazy. Yeah. Well you know what also is ramping up people taking pills. Yeah. These things are somehow, are they? They might not be the cause of it. 100% it might be society, it might be suppression, it might be terrible childhood rearing. It might be childhood abuse in might be all sorts of like mental health issues that are inherited. All sorts of crazy diseases that people inherit mental diseases. Even the vaccine pamphlets. There's I think that HPV vaccine that like girls are taking it at 10 11 and 12 man, that the shit that it says in the past, but there's not just one to one site. Possible side effect is suicidal thoughts wanting to, it's called an one, it's called impending doom.

Speaker 5:          01:00:57       What's up? Take your pills last night. That documentary on Netflix that's been going around. How is it? It's pretty good. There's not a lot, a lot. A lot of the adderall one isn't. It is, it is, yeah. So there's not a lot of information we don't already know. I feel like they just kind of compile it and make it look really good. But one interesting thing that you'd like, he just brought up. A doctor says in it, there's no side effects to pills. There's just unintended benefits or non benefits that you want. They're all affects. There's no like side effect of like diarrhea for instance. It's an effect of the pill. Just wasn't what you wanted.

Speaker 1:          01:01:28       I see what you're saying. Don't call it the side effect. An effect. Right. So if he takes something and on some people it gives suicidal thoughts. It's not a side effect. It's just an effect of taking that to those people. There's, there's girls wanting to kill themselves for taking the HPV. That's his dad for taking acne medication. Accutane is a big that one. Oh, do you know Andrew Santino? Hilarious comedian. Funny Mother Fucker. He took acutane when he was saying high school. Is that what he said? Said it was like the best thing that ever happened to him because his face totally cleared up. But the worst thing that ever happened to him in terms of like how it made them feel like, it just, it makes me feel a lot of people get it and they get suicidal thoughts. Yeah, for sure. See. So you got to ask yourself, you know, even if, whether, whether whether kids really are shooting up schools or it's a false flag in there setting up the kids to

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       do it with. That's the other side. Whatever the, whatever the, the truth is there. There's a gigantic problem with these pills that are making people crazy and no one really, this is not a big push to stop it or anything. They're being protected there being retired. There's a giant business in it. There's billions of dollars. Sure. But there's also a lot of people that liked those pills. There's a lot of people that loves xanax. Like this is, again, this is one of those things where we always want to look at the bad side of it. A lot of people love crack to crack person. You could get thrown in jail for that. Yeah, no, for sure. But I mean people that are functional people just how you like weed. I like weed. Some people like Xanax. I'm not saying you can't have that. It's not my opinion.

Speaker 2:          01:03:04       It's not, it's not, that's not how I feel. What I am saying is like we need to be honest about the consequences of all these things and that this is somehow or another left out of the equation when I think it's a major part of the equation. I don't think it's the only reason why people are shooting up schools or any of this shit, but I think it absolutely must be playing a factor and for whatever reason people don't want to consider that factor. And I think some of it is because there's a lot of people out there who liked those pills. They liked the way they feel on antidepressants. They liked the way they feel on anti anxiety medication. They like take an ambien before they go to bed. They don't want to hear. They like what it gives them. I know people who can't sleep without ambient, they can't sleep without it.

Speaker 2:          01:03:45       If you tried telling them that Ambien fucks up your heart rate or does this to that or you know, make up some things. I don't know if it fucks up your heart and just saying that if you started saying that to people they would, they would just immediately tune out whatever dude, I'm sleeping like a baby. You know, it'd be a great false flag is if they set up another shooter and just said he was totally stoned, you know, that way they could reversely because of course nobody would buy the legalization of weed of course to choke. Do you know what? Uh, I, um, what would I started smoking then changed my mind. They have the power in the media, ted, to turn it into that. Like all of a sudden these guys are getting really high in Colorado and in California we need it.

Speaker 2:          01:04:23       We need a, it's a joke. It's not funny. I wouldn't work today. I've been smoking blunts and I would like, I smoked him. I was like, okay, now I understand rap music. Like I was like, these rappers are so aggressive, but they're also high. I'm like, what the fuck's going on? It's the God damn tobacco tobacco mixed in with weed. That is a different thing. That's a different animal. It's a little too potent. Sometimes it's a little too woo. It's like you're like, you're like, what are we talking about? I like it every now and then. Every now and then I like to, I like, and I'm like, you know what gives you a different kind of head buzz? Well, tobacco things, yet I donald's her own, he got me under dip when he was not a not, I haven't done it since then, but when we were in the podcast, he did it.

Speaker 2:          01:05:03       I swallowed some of it and uh, but one thing I liked about it, I was like, oh, now I get why you guys do it. It's like, it hypes you up. It gets you kind of like elevated, you know? It's like you ever smoke a cigar? Maybe too. It's a version of a cigarette. Like you're getting your time, some serious fucking nicotine. Your system. When you smoke a fat Stokey, you've got a big old fucking Hoyle de Monterrey double corona and you're put out castle style. By the time you get to the end of that thing, your highest fuck dude. You're not high like you can't talk or like you can't walk or you can't function, but you're definitely feeling that tobacco, you're feel it's, it's doing something to your system and they say it actually has a cognitive enhancing function that's similar to nootropics and coffee as well that are like it.

Speaker 2:          01:05:51       It actually can make you perform better on tests if you smoked cigarettes or if you smoke a cigar and writers always say that like I know a lot of people who write like writers for sitcoms and stuff like that. Those guys always smoked cigarettes when they write and they say they can't write without smoking. Steven King said that it's like their weed. Yeah, well it, it does have something going on men, but it's instead of like, it's not, it's to me it's more like amped than it is creative. We'd is super creative. Weed makes me think of thoughts while I write them down on my, I can't even claim that. That's not even my thought, but that's weeds thought. You know what I mean? Like I would have never just leave me by myself with no drugs in a, in a notebook. I would've never come up with that idea.

Speaker 2:          01:06:34       But the weeds like, hey man, listen to this. You know, the weed weed is way more of a, uh, like an idea steroid. I believe it, dude. I see people who don't smoke weed and they write and I'm like, cool, you're so brave out there out there with no helmet. You got no life preserver on. And now it's crazy legal everywhere. This amazing, this recreational weed in California. It's insane. He just walked nine states now. Yeah. Crazy. I think 18 states have league, a legal medical and nine states have legal, recreational, nice. Two-Cents mass. Yeah. It's a wave. It's going across the whole country. It's changing everything and it's good. And you know what the next wave is? MTMA MTMA therapy for PTSD patients has unprecedented results. Maps is involved in this. What does it, multiple [inaudible] Multiple Disciplinary Association for Psychedelic studies or something like that. Maps is amazing.

Speaker 2:          01:07:34       A really above board organization that, um, is at the forefront of legalization of psychedelics and of psychedelic research and they've been involved in studies with soldiers and they have amazing results with this stuff. Mtma just lets you forgive yourself and lets you forget everything. It reprograms your brain had reprogram, lets you forgive other people in your life. It changes. It could. One hit of MDM, MDM and Dma, I that always confuses me, molly and said it's a lot easier. One hit can change your taste in music for ever, for ever. I believe it because before he ever did it, the first time I did it was 1997

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       and before that I was a dj at this point and I couldn't stand techno. I hated techno music so much and I was a dj and anytime a girl went on stage and she was a technocrat, I'm like, this is because I played drums for real. So when you listen to techno or house, it's like that's the most basic dump chute. Every song, every fucking drum beat to Sam. I couldn't accept it as a musician. And most musicians feel that way about tech now. And um, I went to a birthday party at the key club in Hollywood and I walk in and upstairs is techno and downstairs in the little bottom club is hip hop and it was a birthday party and everyone was downstairs. And me and my buddy rick, we walk in and we're standing at the edge of the techno floyd and there's like all these dudes just like dancing by themselves or just like mental cases, right.

Speaker 3:          01:09:05       And I was just standing there looking at him going, what the fuck is wrong with these people? Oh my God. So I went downstairs or playing hip hop and like, that's what I want to hear it at clubs. I want to hear hip hop at a club, I want to dance with a girl, not by myself, you know, so I'm downstairs and then they start passing around some molly. And so say we want to do, and I'll never forget that that first one was blue. I'm like, I dunno, I dunno. So I took it. Me and my buddy both took it and it hit us that that first hit just hits you like a fucking pile of bricks. We go upstairs and we're on the dance or dancing like morons, dude, and we're looking at each other. Go, you get it. I get it. I go, you'll get it.

Speaker 3:          01:09:46       I get it. From that point on, you got all into Trent's? Yeah. From that point, it wasn't just like that night. It changed my musical taste right in one hit and I had a friend at the club, it was a total rnb duty, hate a techno, and he would talk shit. When I play tech and I got one day, you're going to do some modeling and you're going to be all into technical. It's a fuck you. That will never happen. I can't stand this music. He starts dating the raver check like six months later at the club, some raver chick, he ends up at a ray. He ends up dropping some molly, he starts coming in and bringing all these new tech note cds and he's all into full blown in the transit tech. No, just one hint. This is the real, real

Speaker 2:          01:10:26       problem. It's illegal, so when you get it from someone, you don't know what the fuck you're getting. That's the real problem with molly. This is a real problem with Mtma. It's also the dosage. You don't know what the dosage is supposed to be. Look, you can overdose on alcohol and alcohol's everywhere, but everybody knows what the dose of alcohol is was. You go to a bar and you get a shot of Jack Daniels. You know what that is? It's not like sometimes you get a shot of Dac, Jen, Jack Daniels in his Jack Daniels. Sometimes you get it in, it's super fucking moonshine is 10 times stronger and you die. That's the problem with heroin. Yes. The problem with a lot of things, the real problem with Mtma seems to be that it's illegal. That's the real problem and what they're finding is that there's great benefits if it's used correctly.

Speaker 2:          01:11:08       I mean, anything can be abused, but that doesn't mean we should make it illegal and what they want to do. I think their, their timeline is somewhere around 2021 making it legal for, for therapy. It's going to change the world. It's going to change everything. It's gonna change the way people feel about the past is going to change the way people interact with each other. You're going to know just by people's behavior whether or not they've ever done it right. You know where it comes from, where MTMA comes from? Well that's the part of it. The act of ingredient that takes you a, that just plant, right? Where's that plan at the of Thailand. Crazy wars over Thailand or Cambodia in Cambodia. It's like the bark, like the, something about the like the root of a tree trunk or something. Yeah. So it has something to do with a tree, James pulling it up, but it becomes very dangerous for those people.

Speaker 2:          01:11:58       Right? Like all that the trafficking becomes crazies. Yeah. They fuck up for us. Like for us being chopped down of just, just for the people being murdered. It's like, it's heavy duty stuff. Sassafras. Um, I dunno, I googled it and just look at images and that's what's popping up. Maybe it was a place Mtma Cambodia trees. Bars. Sassafras. Okay. Maybe that is Sassafras and SEF. Rolly Sassafras. Yeah, I guess it Sassafras Dude. It's a whatever, whatever that plan is. They take the see if that just google vice, uh, the making of ecstasy, cause I'm pretty sure vice to this. But could you go with that please? I think a vice had a special on that. I wonder what would happen if he just ate it raw. I wonder, can you do that?

Speaker 6:          01:12:46       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:12:47       Um, is there a special, what does it say?

Speaker 2:          01:12:52       The truth about ecstasy? Yeah. So there's, there's some sort of a vice episode where they grow this stuff anyway. Um, this should be something that's not distributed by criminals were in ski masks like you've seen in this video should be something distributed by stores and they should be doctors. And if you wanted it, you could have a rave where you even have medical centers in the rave. We keep people from overdosing the transitionary period from people going from drugs being totally illegal to some drugs, having massive benefits. Like if you're, you go to a club, right? And everyone, there's, c'mon, we're doing shots, were doing shots, the whole fucking bars getting wasted and drunk. Everybody's fine with that. But you're not fine with a club where everybody does a small amount of ecstasy. Well, why can't you do that? Well, that's drugs. Well, the other one's drugs too.

Speaker 2:          01:13:40       He just used to those drugs. Once we get past that hurdle, and it might take a whole generation before people get used to places where you can go, one drug gets you violent, one drug makes you want to have sex. So listen, you're not going to stop that drug. Here's my point. It's a powerful, really useful drug. People going to find out about it. It's an amazing experience. They're going to do it. So what's the best way to handle that? Best way to handle is make it safe, make it legal, make it regulated so they know what actually is in each one of these fucking pills. You're not getting it from some pimp or some asshole or some fucking crazy dude is stuffed in a balloon. Put it up his ass hole and made it across the border with it. You don't know where the fuck you're getting this stuff.

Speaker 2:          01:14:19       All sorts of shit. Amphetamines and all sorts of crazy shit. And people die from it because they don't know what the fuck is in there. Here it is. Yeah. Um, okay. It says more a boy, Mr Mode a h p. R e w p. H n. O. M. Trees. Murray proved pericom trees in Cambodia and the, they're found in Cambodia's Oh, Sassafras. The factory has been set up to distill, sacrificed oil, uh, processed by boiling the roots and the trunk of the exceptionally rare plant. Oh, they're really rare trees to wow. How crazy is that? How many of these fucking trees or like in the middle of the rain forest and we don't know about, you know, I mean, there's some, there's gotta be some shit where they haven't tapped into it yet. They're finding all sorts of different pharmaceutical drugs that they can cocked out of stuff.

Speaker 2:          01:15:06       The transplants, they buy Amazon. Yeah. They find all the insects are evolving so fast and the Amazon that they only have names for I think 90% 10% of the insects, 90% they have no names. No, it's crazy. Is that true? They have all sorts of bugs and the Amazon for sure that they have an identified, they know that for a fact and they do evolve. They're rare thing where you can, there's like some primitive life forms that you could find that didn't exist before. Like they found this crayfish, I think it's in India or Europe, maybe Europe, crayfish that produces by cloning. They don't have sex. So female, they're all female and one crayfish just makes a bunch of other babies. It just makes babies just need sex. And they're like, what the fuck? I mean obviously there's no genetic diversity. Right. Cause they obviously would need a male DNA.

Speaker 2:          01:15:57       It makes it the female DNA. There it is. Mute and crayfish clones itself and it's taking over Europe. So this crayfish doesn't fuck, they just reproduce like one crayfish could just reproduce. It's really bananas. So this is a new thing that didn't exist 25 years ago. This is something that they're very sure wasn't a, a living organism up until recently. Here's the good thing. Crayfish are delicious. People are starving to death. Now they've got some mother fuckers that all you have to do is just throw some stuff in there. You don't have to count on them. Fucking, maybe it's the same stuff that made the frogs gay. Could be, could be bro. Maybe it's linked. Could be, but if you, I mean it could be, could be pesticides, it could be. Um, look, there's another thing about the amount of people that flush pills down the toilet and how much that shit goes to water treatment plants and into, um, aqueducts and reservoirs and shit.

Speaker 2:          01:16:50       Yeah. There's a lot of pills that get flushed down our toilets and some of them make it into rivers and shit. Some of them making it to the ocean. You know what's supposed to be particularly bad. I never thought about this until a friend of mine who was a surfer told me he was a yoga teacher, was a surfer and said nobody told him and he got real sick cause he went into the ocean right after the rain. You can't go to the ocean after the rain because when it rains in La, all that bullshit, all the chemicals and toxins and cleaners and oil and gasoline and plastic washes into the water like right at the shore. And that's where it's all just swashing around in there with the waves and you get in there and you get sick as fuck. You're basically getting poisoned.

Speaker 2:          01:17:31       Is there some kind of filtration system before they just let all the water just run right and right is right from the streets, from the runoff just from the streets. I think it, where does the toilet water go? Does that water goes through a sewage system that goes through a sanitation system. But sometimes those break, I was uh, at the Charles River in Boston once and it was a, it was like right across the street from where I lived and I'd hang out there all the time when I was a kid and I was standing there on the shore and I saw these bubbles and like these chunks of things floating up to the water. And I was like, what the fuck is that? And then I saw condom bloke come up and I went, ah, that's a sewer pipe death, flushing condoms and like shit and condom water.

Speaker 2:          01:18:17       It's coming right through the fucking ground into this river where all these fish lift, these fish are probably living off a human shit. What's the water like after the s the sewage water runs through the filtration system. What does that water perfect and where does it go? Fiji puddles that does it go into 99 to 99 for eight ounces. Based on what I saw online, it seems like Fiji water is the best water out there. Like they took, they tested a lot of bottled water and, and a lot of bottled water has a lot of bullshit in it. Look at this. After 50 years, Boston's Charles River just became swimmable again. Took $500 million in nearly two decades of work. Here's how the city did it. That's it, man. That was the river that's connected to over that river. Went all the way down near my house.

Speaker 2:          01:19:05       Why would you say the polluted people are gross? Well, dude, when and people started building shit in the 18 hundreds it didn't give a fuck about the future. They took that sewer pipe and just lay it right there, pop it right into the fucking ocean. I'm gonna take a shit right in that water. It's going to go shooting down at pipe and drop right in a fish's head. Who Cares? They didn't give a fuck when they were building things. They would have all their industrial runoff just go right into rivers. They taught, they polluted thousands of rivers. Like who the fuck knows how many fish died? Because people in the early days of the industrial revolution were fucking assholes. They didn't have any consequences. They didn't, they didn't think about the possibility of completely destroying the environment. Like that didn't exist before the age of the industrial machines. The only time it existed before that was in dead bodies would, would pollute rivers systems after war. You know, like when people would throw bodies into rivers like that would, you know, that would fuck up people's wells that would fuck up. Uh, you know, any drinking. What people got real sick. How did king's Shit, well, what did their toilets look like? Like back in the 1,516 it was like some dude

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       the his mouth. Yeah, you're exactly right. I don't have shit right. Dab Pimp ass toilets for the kings back in the day. I'm sure they did. Once you google it, Jamie Google's toilet toilet from King Henry the eighth that King Henry the go killed all his wives, right? Toilets from all the way back in the bcs. But I'm going to go to more resemble King Henry. A's got tired of those ladies just cut their fucking heads off. A king's loaf go to. Where does it lead to? Suspected by by doctors. They want to make sure it's got enough fiber in his diet. Keep His highness alive. Where did the changes? She would just find Jamie, what's that face called? A thunder mug. Oh, nice. Pull that up. Here we go. Hold on. Make sure. Oh, okay. This is a for the 16 hundreds that's what he shit into.

Speaker 1:          01:20:57       That's why I say is this is a shakespearian chamber pot, not the bards own thunder Mug, but it is a typical chamber pot and that's what they would call them chamber pots. So it's a potty shit in like literally shit in a pot that looks sturdy. The, so it's really like a toilet bowl. It's like a toilet bowl. It just doesn't have water in it. Do you think they've left water in it to make it easier to clean up next to it? Probably smarter to have water in there. So you plop in the water? Yeah. Otherwise you get a couple of slaves and pull it out. Dumping your good luck. If you ever have to take a shit on a plane and you see how little water there is and that little thing that you drop in logs into, and then when you flush it never gets it all, you know, and you've got to think, do I just like play stupid and get Outta here?

Speaker 1:          01:21:40       I gotta give a courtesy flush. American revolution is a hole in the ground. Nice magic fallen into that hole. That's your death. You choked to death on shit. It's happened. 100% happen. Tapping, I read about a dude who fell into a septic tank. The felony has septic tank and drown had a septic tank in his backyard and he was fixing it somehow or another and it broke a fell through and he dragged in a fucking septic tank. How did they get rid of their shit in the city? Just regular peasants. Like what did they just around in the streets or did they have to collect it and drag it out to the woods to, good question. Well, there was a real issue, uh, in Rome in the early days of people shitting in the streets. And apparently there's a lot of people in San Francisco right now that a shitting in the streets.

Speaker 1:          01:22:27       It's a real issue. Jake shields, my friend, uh, the MMA fighter, um, Jujitsu master, jake shields, you know, of course he put a video up on instagram of some dudes shitting, like pulling his pants down and like shitting right into the street. Like you said, it's happening everywhere. San Francisco has done an amazing amount of bombs. I think it was jake shields. I don't want to speak out of turn. Pretty sure it was just the best city for homeless people for sure. They let people do whatever the fuck they want and that city, there's so nice. It's so open minded and they feel so guilty because they made $1 billion from like brazzers.com or some shit, you know, they take the bait, all that tech money, you know, like it's different kind of

Speaker 2:          01:23:05       money there. They're so liberal in comparison to like Wall Street banker type dudes. Those dudes are like cut throat, right wing, like private jet. Fuck you Minko big watch. Go cow, cow doing coke. Whereas the money on the other side, like the tech money, they're all like, well diversity is really important. And, and women, they need to be represented in tech and this is their space. This is the space for them to, we need to let them know, we need to encourage that. Like there's so left way, if they're like these homeless people, they also be, just because they don't have an address doesn't mean this city is not equally. There's, you know, we have to help them and offer aid crackheads just taking diarrhea, splatter shifts against walls. I think they just let these people get away with, they were fucking mentally ill people and they just let them wander around through their streets cause they really cared.

Speaker 2:          01:23:59       You know what they would do, they would, uh, really put some money into taking care of these people. So just letting them wander around the streets, shitting all over the place. Have a place where you can get them clothes from the salvation army or something like that. Have a place where you'd give him regular showers, have something that's like appealing they can go to all the time. So you keep them from just shitting on the streets in front of everybody. Like that's crazy. Billy Corgan had a residency in San Francisco of up maybe eight years ago and uh, it was all about him just writing songs on the spot and then going on stage that night and doing brand new songs. I could weird kind of residency. And he had this one song that he wrote about, he just hanging out in the park in San Francisco and just wrote about the bums and how disgusting it all was and called the song peace and love.

Speaker 2:          01:24:47       Excellent song. One of his greatest songs. It's deep. It's about the bums. There's so many men. We used to run into him all the time. When we did gigs in San Francisco, we'd go out to eat and you'd have to do like this bomb obstacle course on the way to the restaurant. Oh, here comes wanting to get across the street. Oh No, no, no. I don't have any money, bro. They're super aggressive tests. Yes. People were real tolerant there. Yeah, but isn't that better? That's better than the opposite. It's better. That's, I think it's good to live in a place that this tolerance as possible. Even if the super lefties get annoying, you don't want the opposite to see they might fuck up because there's the same sort of mentality that goes on with people on the far left and people on the far right and that mentality is my way's the right way.

Speaker 2:          01:25:29       I'm right. You're wrong. Fuck you. I'm going to make you change. I'm going to make you do what and that doesn't work. That doesn't work on anybody, but I always feel like it's safer and better when that's happening towards like kindness and compassion and income equality and all these things that are, I see like even though it gets very authoritarian, I see that at least it has like a good heart to it all. Like even if it's misguided, some of it's missing, some is misguided or even if they're pretending did, there's always that. That's a good move. Right? If you're going to pretend you pretend towards the left, yeah, she was some money.

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       Yeah, you could steal all sorts of tax money. Just pretend. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:26:08       you're helping people. There's definitely a lot of that going on. There's no doubt about that. Dude. We haven't talked about Tony Ferguson. It's two o'clock. Yeah, this is the kind of just walk already. Holy Shit. We ramble down. Um, we have to talk about Tony Ferguson, seeing as how you, his Jujitsu coach. And I was fucking convinced. I told Jamie, I told Jimmy Smith, I'm like, I'm not buying it. I'm not buying it. It's April fools. The Shit's coming on April fools. Fuck you man. Yo fool me once. Shame on you fool me 50 times or how many times have been busted by April fools? Mike, There's no fucking way. Tony Ferguson got hurt a week before the fight. There's no way. Yeah, and it's true. That's the first thing I thought. I'm like, oh my God, everyone's going to think this is April fools. This Dana says, yeah, everyone's, no one's going to believe this.

Speaker 3:          01:26:53       Can I found out, uh, late Saturday night, you know, I'm in the studio with Danny loan or just making some music and, um, you know, I knew something, something might have been wrong because we were supposed to work Saturday afternoon and, um,

Speaker 3:          01:27:17       he never no shows. He's late a lot, but he was late and I'm just hanging out in front of a studio. He's got his own gym now and after awhile he didn't return his tax. I'm like something, you know, he's, he's a fucking superstar. There's a lot of shit going on inside. You said, okay, fuck it is, I laughed and went on with my day, went in the studio and then I get the tax. I can 11, 25 at night, Saturday night. He said, I fucked up. I fucked up my knee. Uh, blew my fucking alcl out. Um, he wants to fight, he wants to fight. He does not, he did not, not want to fight, but his doctor said, you can't fight. And he was like, I need a second opinion. So he went to the UFC doctors and they said, nope, you can't fight his lcls detached from his knee according to, so it's pulled from the bone.

Speaker 3:          01:28:05       It's pulled off the boat. Yeah, that's what they said. It's really, it's, it's not like usually you tell Dana described it. Yeah. Usually you tear your lcl, MCL usually cause I've, I've done my mcl before. It repairs on its own so thick according to what the doctors tell me. I don't know shit, but they're uh, you know, but you need to tell your meniscus. You probably need surgery for that or you tear your acl, you for sure need surgery for that. Um, if it's, if it's, if it's a complete terror, but the lcl and the MCL, the only time there they, again, according to what I hear, the only time we need surgery is if it's fucking blown the fuck out. Like motorcycle acts, acts freak things and uh,

Speaker 6:          01:28:45       okay.

Speaker 3:          01:28:45       When I say Tony wanted to fight, he, he would have fought with that shit. He didn't give a fuck. They wouldn't let him fight. He wanted a fight.

Speaker 1:          01:28:52       Was He walking with sunglasses on? Indoors? I don't know. I don't know what he was wearing. This is what Dana, Dana was saying. I think said he, he tripped over some wires. Some, you know those, those thick cables that they lay down. Yeah. Apparently tripped over the water and fell. Fuck, fuck. That's insane. It's the craziest thing ever. It's insane. It's so crazy. It's so sad that fight. It's doomed. Dana White said he would never put that fight on again. I'm like, are you crazy? Book that Shit again. The thing that sucks is the thing that sucks is a four is a magic number. Dana said in an interview, kind of hinted at or alluded to the fact May, I hope I'm wrong, I hope I'm wrong, but that they would, they're going to strip tony of his interim belt like, you know Robert Whitaker's. Where'd you see that?

Speaker 1:          01:29:40       Um, someone told me I didn't hear it, so that's why I'm saying, I don't know if it's true. Someone said, yeah, David, he just did an interview and he, he was, he was a hinton like oil. He said it and sell it in such a way that Tony is going to get stripped of his belt. And I, and I thought, that's ridiculous. Here's my question. If someone is the champ, right, and they get injured and they can't defend their title, then they have an interim title. Right? But if the interim guy gets injured and can't defend the interim title, do they strip the end? Is that ever happened? Robert Whittaker, he loses interim lightweight title when number grumet often hallway square off. So I guess they're taking the time. They didn't do that. I mean, they didn't do that to Robert Whitaker. He was the interim interim champion.

Speaker 1:          01:30:23       Should they have an interim interim? No, I dunno man. But um, it doesn't seem like they let the whitaker take 11 months off to recover. Why would they do the exact same thing? It was the exact same situation. Robert Whitaker was fighting for the interim, or he had the interim title. He was going to fight, I forget who it was. It was either, I forget who it was. And then he got injured. They didn't strip him right. Why they strip Antonio. Do you feel like it's punishment for him getting injured a week out? Like they're pissed and like fuck it stripped them? Yeah. I don't know. I don't know. But uh, that's, you can't do that so. Right. I mean he got heat. Did Tony wanted to fight more than anybody? We've got to buy what you do. Like if he happens four weeks ago and it's an injury and training and he tears it from the bone, is that they just rescheduled the fight, right?

Speaker 1:          01:31:18       Yeah. And it's still for the interim title. Why is it like a week out the interim is canceled? Maybe it's because they have to make a big fight with Max Holloway versus could be before the world. They have like that cost that cost Tony a lot of money because he has the interim belt. He, he was, this was going to be by far is the biggest pay day ever for him. I mean, he was making some good money. Right? It's because of the belt. Because if you strip him his next fight, he doesn't have that belt anymore to, to, to get money, you know? And so he'll get significantly less money. Say what if you don't have a belt? Hell yeah. Let if what if Max or could be wins, right? One of them I assume is going to win whoever wanted is, and then Tony gets healthy and then they're going to have tony fight one of those guys for the title.

Speaker 1:          01:32:07       Like he would get less than he would have for this fight if he doesn't have the belt. Really? So that's part of the contract. If you have a bet with you are going to negotiate for a fight and you have a belt, you have way more power than if you don't have a belt. Right. So by stripping them of the belt, his next fight, when he heals up and comes back, he's going to, it's going to cost them. And it's not fair because again, Robert Winokur didn't get stripped of his interim belt. They should Max Holloway and Khabib, she'd just fight. Just, you know, a main event fight. It doesn't have to be for a belt because that's gonna Fuck Tony. Well, why would it fuck Tony if he still gets the interim title? If he kept the interim title, then it wouldn't fuck exactly for his next fight when he negotiates for his next fight hung and he would be interim title holder versus world title holder.

Speaker 1:          01:32:56       Why does Max Maxon and could be and have to fight for a bell? It doesn't have to be for a belt. The UFC holds all the cards. They can make up the rules, they can do whatever they want when it comes to the rankings and stuff. Right. They can't do it or whatever they want when it comes to rules. So with their, their position, they're like, look, this is going to cost us shitload of money. How do we recover? Recoup that money? You know, how do we a, okay, we get Holloway to fight. Oh, that's almost as big. That's a giant fight to, okay, now we're back. Now we're back in business and the stripping him thing, I don't know what the policy is on that. I don't know if there's a public policy or if it's just, they just make the call. I think they could do whatever they want to do.

Speaker 1:          01:33:35       Hmm. I don't, I don't think they would never give up that power if they did have it, like to some organizing body. Like why would they write cause organizing bodies could even get corrupted. But I think you have to be very careful when you make like interim titles that you don't make too many of them and you don't have them around too often. You know, you're like, once you have them, you've got to get them resolved pretty quick. Like they're, they, they're a way to build up excitement about the fight. But yeah, I mean I don't think they would have stripped him if you got injured four weeks ago. But who knows? I might be wrong. They might just be, maybe they have a new policy. Maybe they just stripping people, but then conner hasn't fought in 500 days. It's not stripped. Yes, exactly. Not stripped yet.

Speaker 1:          01:34:20       Hasn't fought more than 500 days. MMA. Last time he fought it was Eddie Alvarez does his last time in May fight. That was a long time ago, man, as a long time ago. And then, uh, he hasn't been stripped. So imagine being a lightweight, just sitting around waiting. Well, he's on boxing TV, having a boxing match and floyd mayweather, he doesn't, if he gets stripped of his title, it doesn't defend, it makes 100 million bucks. They're like, when you fight fighting again, and I was like, who fucking knows? It would be say shit. It'd be a lot clear as what to do in this situation. If connor would have just fought like a regular lightweight champion, there wouldn't be this, this interim, uh, confusion. It's so good for conor though. All of it just makes it bigger and bigger. It's like Dave, Dave and changed the rules for him. You know?

Speaker 1:          01:35:07       I mean like, think about that for him. Like it just makes him bigger. He hasn't fun 500 days. Who fucking cares? He's just rolling around a bathtub full of hundred dollar bills every day. Just dive in there and swimming. He can do whatever the fuck he wants to see that documentary on Netflix. No, I didn't. It's really good. Good. Yeah, he knew he was going to be a champion back in the day. It starts when he, he has just one tattoo, the one down, one down his back. That's it. None of the neck tattoos or anything and he already knew. He knew he just had dynamite in his hands, you know, crushing people on the local local scene, crushing them. You know one shots, boom. Yeah. I saw him fight in 2013 I think somewhere around there and his first chance at DFC, I wouldn't have known if I didn't see this documentary.

Speaker 1:          01:35:55       It's hard to keep track of everything but wasn't Sweden. It was a Swedish show. It was like last minute replacement. They brought him in and he fought. What was his name? Black Guy. Shit, I forget his name. Good guy. Real good guy. And he lit him up and that was like damn after that one fight, like there's, there's footage of of him and Dana and like Dana was already, he already knew it. He goes, man, I guess the hype was real. Jesus. My favorite fights with him or the two fights with Nate Diaz though. You know why? Because those are the fights where he couldn't put someone away, just crack them and put them away. So had to see him fight. He had a fight and it's a totally different game. Like if you see what he did to Eddie Alvarez, that was a totally different kind of fight because he's stung.

Speaker 1:          01:36:44       Eddie early had him hurt and he was his, he owned them and then he fucked him up and stopped him. That was a beating. What round was that? I think it was a second single was a second and he barely made it out of the first, right. Yeah, barely made it. I mean he got fucked up from the get go. Connor just had us number is way faster weight quicker and like covering distance, just just like laser beams at night. And I don't think Eddie fought right. I think Eddie was a little bit too caught up in the moment is the big hype of the fight getting to fight conor mcgregor and he just got fucked up, kind of had his hands behind his back and standing right in front of him. Chicken neck and I'm, and then pop them in the face like that was ugly so that you know, like what year was that?

Speaker 1:          01:37:24       That was 500 of those 500 days ago. Like that's the kind of fight is a great fight for conor, but that's all hammer. When he fought nate, he had to be the nail through a lot of that. Yep. The whole fucking second round of the first fight. When nate got them down, it was the second round submission, right, wasn't it? I Dunno when he submitted him, but nate's submit them in the second round. What are you looking at? Me Funny when you've got something these full pull up more than I do with my Dick. That's what connor said. These pull out more than I do with my deck and like how we got to specify with his dead. He must have the only pulled out four times Max. That's not that great. The fights with nate were fights, you know, he had to dig deep and he lost the first one.

Speaker 1:          01:38:08       He got beat up and got taken down. He got his back taken. He got choked. He tapped. I mean he fucking lost that fight. And then the second fight he drops nate. But he can't put nate away. Nate gets back up, they're going after it. There's fucking times where he's got to stand and walk away. He's got walkway cause he's too tired. He can't engage right now. Please. So you've walked away a couple of times in those exchanges. Those were dig, dig fights. What's this buddy? Round two. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. We're submission real Nigga choke four minutes and 12 seconds it around too. Yeah. He beat him down, warm down and then stopped him. That's and the fight that conard one. Could that have gone either? Yes. Yes. It was arguments that's very close fight and a really close fight. I think under the new rules connor probably would have won because um, I think, look, I think even just one knocked down, it's not good enough for a 10, eight round.

Speaker 1:          01:39:00       It's just not, you know, in a, in a five minute round, like one knocked down, it's, it's, it depends on how the other exchanges were going. These changes were all the same and then you cracked him once. He definitely won. But did you win ten eight ten eight is a beat down I think, you know, but even I think that should be wrong. I don't think it should be that. I think she'd be like a hundred points and I think they should have like scores for like one through 10 in striking, one through 10 in wrestling, one through 10 or nonapplicable. If there's no wrestling at all, you just attend. But you got to look at it this way though. If, um, if you could have a fight and in one round it's super close and really nothing happened and just super close and no one really connected anything.

Speaker 1:          01:39:40       And that happens all the time. That's a ten nine round. Right, right. Should, uh, and then you compare that to another round where a guy got dropped but it was kind of a flash knockdown. He pops back up and then they, then it's kind of, even for the rest of the round, that can't be a ten nine too. Right? So either you got to make more, 10 10 rounds or nine nine rounds, and then you could say, okay, knock down doesn't necessarily mean ten eight cause then at ten nine is going to mean one dude. Clearly one any lamb and some good shots. That's a ten nine it's all how you lay it down. So if you're going to give, you know dude who where the round could have gone either way and you're going to get someone at ten nine and it looks just like a dude getting knocked down.

Speaker 1:          01:40:22       It should, that should be different. So it all depends how add more draws or make it so that if you knock a dude down, that's an automatic ten eight round, you're not going to Dennis ten eight you knocked him down. [inaudible] your ass. What if he's beating your ass all over the place and then you catch them with like five seconds to go drop him and he gets right back up and he cracks you with a jab. Do you still get a tenant because you dropped him? I think that's a, I think I would say that's a nine. Nine. Yeah, it's a nine, nine maybe. Right? Cause it depends on how much she's beating your ass before the guys beating your ass down the whole round. And then you clip him once and he drops. Maybe you weren't really beating him down that hard. Maybe it just look like it cause he's still cracked.

Speaker 1:          01:41:06       He, if you were really beating him down, how was he able to to knock you down? It happens all the time. Guys still have power. Especially if you're running into something that's a hard one. That's a hard one to school and knocked down than a beat down. You get out class, the whole match or the whole round and then you get knocked down once. Do you remember when the draw Drago Pete cell fought? Uh, Scott Smith. Scott Smith from rocky four. No, I'm kidding. That's not that. That's your center. Do you remember who drago in the second round against rocky. We met him. Remember I talked to Matt Serra's? I remember Pete Sell Pizza. Yes. I know exactly what you're, Pete dropped, uh, hurt. Um, Scott Smith real bad with a left hook to the body. Like Scott doubled over and winced and pete moved in for the kill and Scott just landed the perfect picture point.

Speaker 1:          01:41:53       But he, but he was at like, wasn't, was hurricane it faking it? No, he dropped an agony after he knocked him out. Yeah. Pete Hook to hook them to the body hurt him real bad. And when Pete moved in for the kill, Scott Smith hit him with a per picture. Perfect. But I do remember, I remember that just knocked him out. He falls back and then Scott Smith's drops to the ground. If they stopped the fight and he's in agony holding onto his side. It was crazy. It was crazy. So that can't happen. Like even if you're beating a guy down there is still moving if they still just plant and just uncork one Pat Barry Check Congo. Remember that shit? Pat Barry had check Congo on co we're street, he was wobbling all over the place. It looked like the fight was over and pat moves in for the kill and boom, check Congo hits him with the hay maker as he's running in flatlines Pat Barry for the first time in his career, chicken happen.

Speaker 1:          01:42:46       If you're not knocked out, you're still moving. You still could knock someone out. It can happen, especially if they get careless. There it is. He hits him with the left lead, this boom. I mean as a picture perfect left hook to the body, but watch this. He's in agony. If Pete moves in back home, I mean that is a crazy right hand. That's like round nine of a lange versus Balboa. I looked at him on the ground and agony afterwards. Pizza couldn't even believe it happened. Yeah, you should always faint before you move in. Always. Always. Even if you think you got a guy hurt checks. Yes. Fees like this. Oh, okay. Okay. Give me something. Show me what you got going on. I mean the best guys, they never just charged like Max Holloway. We fished off. Aldo is. It's constant pressure, constant pressure, but when he feels Aldo firing bags, I'll step back for a second. Right back on your baby. The best painter, that's always pretty good. Damn good at it. It seems like I just saw someone fight in the UFC or maybe Bella tour. That was always just fainting. Just one boy. Wonderboy might get my, my vote

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       for the best fainter because wonderboy also has like, it's like what? What style? Faintings most effective wonderboy has an extra advantage of having that right leg forward or left leg forward, whichever he chooses. Sideway stance with that long body of his, that's a weird thing I've dealt with that man and the old martial arts days and taekwondo days. It's the hardest thing to deal with those long guys that can have a, that have a powerful front leg. He just keeps you away. You don't know what the fuck he's doing, so he faints and then Bam, he comes in with a left hand or he faints and boom is a roundhouse kick in your face. I think he's the most, cause he doesn't also, it doesn't move like everybody else. Everybody else has like sort of a modified taekwondo style or a Moy Thai style rather, except for the taekwondo guys.

Speaker 2:          01:44:37       There's a few guys, like even connor connor has more of a karate style. A lot of the times he'll stand like total. Like when you see him fight Aldo, he stood totally sideways. I mean he was, he was bouncing back and forth, back and forth like a karate fighter. Remember how Don the Dragon Wilson is to, is to just get up on one leg and just keep his left leg kind of flip it. Oh, it just be on one leg and just keep the left leg all the way up. Dude. I sparred with that guy once. He's annoying. Right? Uh, he's very good at that. He's very good at that. He was real nice to try to earn too much energy. Well, he was just not good high kick him. You could tie kick him dude. He's good at that too. If you watch don Wilson's fight with Dennis Lexio, Don Wilson fucked Dennis Alexio up back when?

Speaker 2:          01:45:17       Dennis Lexia, I didn't know about leg kicks. Dennis Alexia want wound up becoming one of the very best guys that leg kicks. He was also one of the first guys I ever saw get his leg broken in a fight. He fought stan the man longe Anitas and he had to a grass skirt Australia and Stan Lodge Nitas he used to work with my friend Shuki remember Shuki the, the, the uh, the Israeli guy who was teaching me kickboxing back in your day, his leg was all fucked up because he would hold pads for Stan longe Anitas he had that big old type leg pad at home. Like if you think some people, like if you see a guy who kicks real hard, right? The heavyweight world champion Moitai guys or Thai boxer, a kickboxer guys like a standalone. Janine is the power they have in their Kik is unfathomable.

Speaker 2:          01:46:08       I remember I brought this up with you, but you say it wasn't you. I was at Beverly Hills Jujitsu once and we were watching Pedro his, oh, kick the bag. And I was like, what? Like you just think of one of those slamming into your thigh and you're like, there's no way. There's no way. He shook, his whole leg was fucked up and holding the pat on one side. He was gonna need a hip replacement. Damn Dude. Magic. I kicked your leg while you're holding pads for him so hard. You need a hip replacement. What was not worth it on the Dragon? Wilson beat the beat. Um, Dennis Alexia with leg kicks with my point. But Don had that weird style. Like he would stand totally sideways and he didn't take any chances. He fought superintelligent. He fought deep into his forties to man. He's an Oj. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:46:53       Commentary with him. He was my partner in King of the cage for maybe five or six shows. Man. Talk about the worst co commentary ever. Me and Donna driving was really bad. Oh yeah. Can you imagine a na commentary is? It's not, that's not my Gig, man. I could do color, but being the play by play guy, that's just a whole, that's a whole different animal with, with Phil Baroni. Ronnie was fucking hilarious. It was the Miami show. Yup. We got to get tiny UFC in Miami. I think that was the only one ever. Right. Um, I don't know about that. This is gone. The Dragon. Don Wilson. Who was he fighting here? There he is. Look at him in these red pants. Oh, it's him fighting Dennis Lexio. Yeah. See how he would just flip that thing out? Everything was like light and flippy and they just, they couldn't, he didn't know what to do with it.

Speaker 2:          01:47:43       They couldn't kick to the legs, right? Oh, they could. Or they could wait. Oh, look at that site. You know, they could see you just kicked him in the leg right there. Don Wilson fucked him up with low kicks in this fight. See? Desolo Alexia was trying to kick them in the legs. This is after what had happened was a lot of these guys like Don Wilson that had a traditional karate background, learn how to kickbox. They realized how potent leg kicks were. A big factor was rick the Jet Rufus Du group as his brother, who was one of the all time best pka style above the waist. Kickboxers Rick Rufus. When I was a kid, man, I want it to be like Rick Rufus. He would fight dude sideways stance and just fucked him up, fucked him up with a hook kicks and roundhouse kicks and dive in with punches like blitz karate style punches.

Speaker 2:          01:48:32       I mean Rick Rufus was doing shit that nobody was doing and he fought his tie. Dude, I do not remember the gentleman's name, but Duke roufus brought it up. I'll podcast is being like a big transformation in his life cause that top side you fight is just chopped. Rick down. Just chose those legs like a mix rules, a little bit of Muay Thai, a little bit of American kickbox and they allowed the leg kicks but they didn't allow elbows or something like that exact set up and and a k one. Yes. Here it is. What does it the guy's name? Yeah, the fight that hug out was pause that real quick. Chang's Plec Keyapp Song Grit Kyat some [inaudible] Chang quick Chinese quick Yuck Song Grit. Which okay. Record. Oh well yeah, he had like more than a hundred professional fights. I mean he was a world champion. He wasn't an okay guy. Yeah, he was really good.

Speaker 2:          01:49:20       Okay. I thought he was a beast. He, okay. Let's see what his, what he was fucking him up with his hands though. Rick roof was fucking him up with his hands. Had Him hurt, had him almost knocked out a couple of times, but he kept landing those leg kicks and the leg kicks back. Had to be carried off in a stretcher. He couldn't fight because he couldn't walk down his legs gave out, gone. Well, he didn't know what it was there. So I mean it'd be, this is like a long time ago. He didn't understand, but he tagged with some punches, man.

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       He could hurt. He could hang with his hands. No, we'll get that spinning back fist and the punch behind it, he was fucking him up. He really was fumbling by little, he was landing them like his little Thai guy is though to take those shots. One of the greatest back fights ever. And kickboxing history. Just, just the fact that this is how Rick Rufus learned the power of who that fucking go back there real quick. Go back there guys. Almost go back. Watch this. Look at this move that he does. He does that. A touch jumping side posts, spinning wheel kick hit him in the head. Dudes out on his feet at the end of the bell, they sit them down in the corner, out on his feet. Just keep playing. This one of the greatest matches that's of all time. So historically significant in martial arts. This is why this is where they learned.

Speaker 1:          01:50:32       Yes. This is one of those American kickboxers. This is, this is was an eye opener. This is like UFC one for kickboxing. Dude. I remember the first, the first time someone ever kicked me in the leg and they didn't even do it hard. They did it to show me like how hard it is when you get kicked in the leg. It was like a light bulb went off. Oh No. The first time I've ever heard of a leg kick. I was, uh, working at the Strip club as a DJ and one of the managers was all into karate. He turned them into, you always had done tournament karate for 12. Oh Shit. Look at this dude. He's lightened him up with his leg kicks. And then, uh, he took me in the back one day and he goes, dude, stand there. Let me kick you.

Speaker 1:          01:51:08       And he kicked me with his shin. He goes, people are doing this now. How does that feel? Does he wasn't, she was experimenting on mine legs. Does this hurt their lending with their shin? And I'm like, damn it. Fuck that a lot. Their Shins. That's weird. Well, the crazy thing is when you feel it for like from someone who's just like tapping your leg, how much it hurts. Now think of this dude whose name I can't pronounce again. Oh look. So rick would try to throw his own kick, but his low kicks were like foot kicks. The, I mean, he was a foot kicker. He wasn't like a Shin Kicker back then. Like most karate guys, we're in step kickers. You would hit a guy with a roundhouse kick, but you had hit him in the body with your instep. You hit him in the head with your instep.

Speaker 1:          01:51:48       Almost everything I ever did up until I started doing Moitai was with my insteps or the heel like heel kicks. We'll kicks. Stuff like that was incredible that Americans didn't figure that out. You know? Isn't that killed him in the leg yet? I mean this is crazy shit. Did he hit him with a punch on the way down? Back that up again real quick. Just out. Just a hair. Look at this. He goes down. Yeah. He elbowed him in the back of the head. Holy Shit Dude. Show that again. Watch this again. Watch what happens. He goes down and on the way down, watch this. Boom. See that elbow, Yo dude, no doubt. Dirty elbow to the back of the dome. One more time please. One more time. Please. Look at this down on its way down. Watch his left. Boom. He fucking cracked the back of his head with the help of referee. Didn't even know what an elbow was. That's an invalid technique. You're tenured, you miss a punch. Landed

Speaker 2:          01:52:46       with his elbow, tried and land a punch. Buddy. Dot. Going to take any points away because you didn't land, Dude. He's fucking that right leg up south potter southpaw. Oh, look at that and made him switch. Dance is, look at that. He's chopping them down. Dude. You can't even imagine how bad this must hurt for Rick Rufus and the middle of this fight. He doesn't know how to block these things. He's taken one on the front leg, one on the back leg. He's just getting crushed. I mean, this is crazy. You want to cross the front with a Dick? Is duties flatfooted now he can't to bullying. Can't spin. He can't spend. Look at this. Accompanied by a stomp. He stopped him. Oh, that's top to the body was legit. Oh my God. Damn. They need to make a movie out of this. This is crazy.

Speaker 2:          01:53:34       They should make a move. They should make a documentary from the boy. A pour a tie fighter. Right, and rufus like make rick roof is the evil white guy. He can't. He wants to blow up the world. He can't even move. This is like, these guys are so important. It's so important to our understanding because Rick Rufus was so good. He was so good and he was doing movies, shit on people. Those jump, roundhouse kick, Spinning Hook kicks. Look at this round too. I mean he was doing some really wild shit and even landing it on this guy like he was fucking good. He was a legit champion, no doubt about it, but he just did not understand the low kick game yet and this was, it was so important for a guy. Look at that. He lands that high kick. It's, it was so important that a guy, as good as him fought this guy so we know for sure it wasn't just that, you know the ric rufus wasn't any good.

Speaker 2:          01:54:28       No rich rufus was fogging or real good. Real good. Then too. He's getting crushed with those and this tie guys look at as open hands to look how he's moving forward. Just open hands. He's all about protecting himself, pushing off and low kicking. Look at his hands. See His hand placement. I mean, that's crazy shit. Look at that. Boom, pushing off. He's barely even tried to punch with them. He's basically just using his hands to create space and distance and give Rick Rick roof is something to think about and to block the punches in the kick that rufus throws and then boom leg kicks. He just leg kicks him to death. Look at that. He's not punching. He's just leg kick. Leg kick. Hands up, hands up like that is crazy. As soon as he stopped exchanging punches, he just started dominating the space and then slamming those leg kicks in. Look at that. Boom. Fakes with the hand and across both thighs. That's one of the most painful ones, man. The ones across both thighs. Ah, ah. Rob came in back when I was getting coaching from him. He tapped me across the front of my thoughts with his shin. Just dunk. Just tapped me. My legs hurt all day. This guy. Wow. Really that throw holy Shit. Those ties. Can Chuck each other around.

Speaker 1:          01:55:43       Two man round posted a little clip. Oh Shit. Look at that. Of a fight where they had, didn't they just wrapped up their hands? They didn't have gloves and the head butts were legal. It was kickboxing or you could throw pieces and you could have, but did you see that clip? No Dude, it's evil guy headbutts his opponent standing up. He just, just spears his head right into a knocks the guy down just from a headbutt and rufus. Like he only stands that one way most of the time too. So that that front right leg is so vulnerable to that left outside kick cause they're both southpaw. If rucc rick see now he's trying to switch up and he's putting his left leg forward cause he's in so much pain. Like look, when he walks back to his corner do he could barely walk at the end of the third round.

Speaker 1:          01:56:27       Barely. Was this in Thailand or was in the states? I don't know where it was. It looks, it says cores, beer on the canvas. I want to think it's in America and plus the way they're making them where he's wearing those pants. I got to think it's America. Those pants look so stupid in comparison. And also Rick Rufus was also wearing pads on his feet. Oh Shit. How did he go down their leg? Kick another leg. Can you rewind that Jamie? Look at the pads. Look at the pads on his feet. Okay, here, look at this. How does he go down? Oh that was just the leg kick. Yeah, just low kick caught him in the spin and just totally took his leg out and he's wearing those, those booties on the tops of his feet to like to protect the bones of his feet cause he's a foot kicker.

Speaker 1:          01:57:08       See what I'm saying? Like that's extra weight. You were an extra four ounces or whatever the fuck it is on your feet. It slows your kicks down and the Thai guy just says taped up ankles and shorts on. It's really interesting because it's really is like kickboxing versus Moitai pool and we chopped the leg gambling, we chops late. Again, look at this work roof is in so much danger here. I mean he's basically just totally helpless. And this tie guys going across the shins. He's going across the, if he's blocking with his knee, he doesn't give a fuck. He's just kicking through him everything. Boom. Look at that. Boom, look at that. He's just walking him down.

Speaker 1:          01:57:44       Boom. And then another one, no terrifying. That must be to have that guy walk you down like that. Hands out like that. They call the fight, I think is that jt will the referee is a famous referee who got it was will and like all those karate. That's Dick Dude. That's Duke right there. Now that's not jql. That's a duke right there. Uh, telling everybody that he didn't think that it took a lot of skill to kick someone's legs. I think rick should've won the fight. He had the guy, big historical stuff. The way the cookie crumbles tonight. Let's take a look at the monitor down here, Jeff, and became like the man, look at this. Bam there, you know, he says buck on his knees to do the same type of injury that Angela football player's career. You know, I don't think it takes much town to kick somebody in the legs as you thought.

Speaker 1:          01:58:38       Those jumping, what's crazy now eric? We're throwing in all deep and real town. Well, it was crazy. I mean, Duke I think was only 19 at the time. You know, he's changed. He's, he's learned. And one of the reasons why he's so good is because he's open minded, but he became a world champion, more Thai fighter himself, which is crazy. It's just like Jujitsu and leg locks. I know what I mean. It's just like that, that doesn't take any town. You're just jumping on a guy's lag, dude. All, all martial arts techniques that are effective, there's still people that don't believe in certain techniques. And the big, uh, another big moment for Maury tie in the history of that martial art was, uh, Paul Varland versus Marco. Who else? That's when we saw was UFC seven. That's when we saw the damn cause before UFC seven, everybody was thinking, okay, you can't really do any kind of striking you.

Speaker 1:          01:59:27       You, you have to learn Jujitsu or you will lose. It's going to be, people were just losing faith in striking all together, like just work on, um, uh, it, it was almost like jabs didn't even work back then. Like who throws a jab in mma? You're going to get taken down and get choked out. And UFC seven, that's when we learned, okay, leg leg kicks work. You got to 300 pounds. Yeah. That changed everything. Yeah. Portland's violence was huge. The polar bear there. Call them tech. I was gigantic. And Marco who washes took his legs and then marco, who was, he also beat revco par do that judo champion. You remember he mounted them and then tap. He goes, it's over. Once you get them out. That's what he thought. That's it. That is what he thought. Isn't that crazy? Look at this marco. Who else would get heel hooks on people and shit? Who's he fighting? Says, yeah, I get some in the heel hook right here for this. I think this is the first he'll hook in. The UFC. Might've been if it wasn't him, it was, um, oh, that's amazing. Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Maybe he Ken Shamrock against Patrick Smith. Yes. I don't know if that was a heel and ankle walk. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          02:00:38       I dunno. A heel hook. Yeah. Ken probably had the first ever leg lock and then I was going to say, oh look, tech tar off didn't all that gets him heal hooks. He got a knee bar and a straight ankle lock I think. Oh old school son. Old Kinda mma show revealing old fights. Man King in the streets, baby. Give me five Paul Paul Varland. It's v a are viral and you were talking to Eric Apple about his old days sparring with Marco. They would spar Brazilian style, get ready for concussions. It's just, yeah, it didn't matter if you get your nose broken, get back in there like everybody was just going to war. That's what dad, everyone was scared to death of back in the early days and I was a white belt ever. You hear about health gracie school up in it's Paul violence versus that Marco, who was versus that's Paul violence fighting. It looks like in a pre UFC fight or maybe after his UFC career. He was, he was a master of was it trapped?

Speaker 2:          02:01:40       Fighting? I Dunno. I think it was trapped and that you're really, there it is right there at the top. It's the UFC. UFC. He wore a singlet. Remember he wore a wrestling singlet? Yeah. Like look, he's six. Seven. Can you get this big fella? Can you wear those singlets anymore? You can't write. No. Why not? Uh, it's a good question. Girls can, well actually it looks like he's got different colored shorts on or is that the Monitor? So he's a tank top. Is a tank top on? He's fighting with a tank top on. It's not even a single it right. It looks like a singlet. It a little bit, but doesn't look like different colors. Well, maybe you're right. Maybe it's just we're seeing his legs and yeah, it probably is going to the last minute. It has a phone. The last minute of the fight, that's where he chops him down.

Speaker 2:          02:02:23       He just chopped him down there with the first one. Boom. He's so much smaller than I look how small Marco is in comparison to Marco's a bit guy. Boom. See Paul violence doesn't have any idea what to do here. So he, he just keeps kicking back. Oh, he just touched his leg. He did. Oh boom. Oh, chop them down. Your fucks now. So, and Marco just got on top of him a trop to hammers on them. Boom. Boom. No gloves. Yeah. Old School. After that, everyone started throwing a leg kicks firmly believe we need to go back to no gloves. Firmly believe. I can't emphasize it enough. I think people would get less hurt. I think you'd, it'd be a more realistic, you got to have Rogan fighting championships on an Indian reservation. I don't think it makes that. I mean, I'm beating a dead horse.

Speaker 2:          02:03:11       I know I'm a broken record. I just don't think it makes sense to tape your wrists up. Your wrists are very vulnerable. You shouldn't be able to just make a cast out of them and slam him into things. I feel the same way about your ankles. Like, imagine if you could tape your wrist up to the point where nobody or your ankle up to a point where nobody could ever get you in a foot lock cause your ankle was protected. That'd be ridiculous, right? We'll essentially, when you get someone in a wrist lock, what are you doing? You're pulling against the wrist. Well, is that a valid technique? Okay. A valid technique like a wrist lock like this, very hard to do when someone's risks is taped the fuck up. When your wrist is really Rocco right across here, it goes all over your knuckles.

Speaker 2:          02:03:45       It goes all around new arrest. He goes all around your wrist and makes it much more stable. You can really dig into things. It feels way better. It feels way better to hit things because when you don't, especially like my hand is bigger than my wrist, so if I hit things on either side, it'll be like more wobbly. You want it that you want that bitch taped up, you know? Yeah. And even if your hand is the exact same size as your wrist man, it's just, this is a joint that is a super articulating look at this wrist and he looked at all the stuff your risk does. Your wrist is crazy. It really think about joints is the only joint like it. Your knees don't do that shit. I guess your shoulders are kind of crazy, but your wrists, when you're punching, you would have to develop some serious, strengthen your forearms to be able to be a really effective bare knuckle fight.

Speaker 2:          02:04:32       I mean truly bare knuckle, no wraps in your hands. No nothing. Just truly knuckle you had. You had also learned that you must punch things with the top knuckles. You have to, and even then you could break them. But if you start hitting, people in the jaw are great there with this crack, this fucking thing is just going to break. Hit somebody in the forehead right here, crack. It's going to break. You're going to break them. You get elbows, break them for sure you're gonna break up. But with those gloves on, you get away with that shit. You can get away with that shit and you could, you could pitty pat guys, you could do that more and just not even like tried to find like specific spots. Just start hitting them. You can't do that. You have to make sure you're getting the soft tissue.

Speaker 2:          02:05:12       You've got to target soft tissue. You've got to look for the job. Bang. Body appears to the public to be more brutal. Right? If you don't, right. Listen man, all you need to do is watch anybody kicked somebody. Just think the fact that we let someone slammed their fucking Shin into some dude's face. That is watch Jeremy Stevens when Jeremy Stevens fought Honney j uh, what's his name? Honey. Jason, remember honey? Jason. Jeremy Stevens. Hi Jason. It is like the head kick to end all head kicks. I don't remember. Oh shut up. You guys aren't allowed to pull up like a, you'll see footage. I wish we could we switch to have a special exemption from the past. Like maybe like promote bypass every time you use it. That would be good. Great way to promote it. Right? They would let us thing one time, like they reached out and said like here's an account, but then they never responded.

Speaker 2:          02:06:01       I was like, okay, let and then, but that'd be a great way to promote it. But yeah, I'll talk to the UFC. I'll try to see what we can get done on your show. You could talk about fights and and have no issues with pulling up the awesome. That would be huge for them. That would, it's free. They don't pay me for this and that's, that's how people would do it at home. Maybe hanging out with their friends going, fuck, remember that one fight. Put It on fine. You coming in New York this weekend anyway? No. Come to New York. No, no. Cause I gotta be there the next week. Anyways, I got to go to Brooklyn again the following weekend. Geo is fighting Gordon Ryan's brother. Oh Shit. That's been, that's going to be amazing. It's going to be awesome, man. Those guys are awesome. I love the level of Jujitsu that's available right now.

Speaker 2:          02:06:41       It's way better than ever. I mean, the level of just the purple belts these days would destroy purple belts of like eight years ago. Amazing. It's crazy. And it keeps going up and up to, I was watching some videos today online. Instagram's huge. The loop when you watch a technique and you can just watch it over and over again. Exactly. Yeah. That makes, that accelerates the learning process so much. I was watching a clip today. I washed it like 15 times in a row. It was, I'm a Cyborg during that Tornado guard pass, uh, on some big giant Dude Cyborg Bjj I think is this thing. He hit this giant dude with that tornado sweep, you know, he does that. He gets under you and spins and rolls over. Very, very interesting to watch be people can do that. That's so strong. But that's what his post was about.

Speaker 2:          02:07:33       His posters about technique. And is that like your technique is like the steering wheel, but your strength is the engine? Yes. I believe that. I believe that too. I mean every top pro athlete has a serious strength and conditioning program. You look at Gordon Ryan's body. Yeah. Well that kid's body, that kids our goal. Rilla you know it's not, it's not a coincidence that he's jacked as fuck and has awesome technique and taps. Cyborg. You think about how good Cyborg as then think about him tap and Cyborg and tap them pretty handedly. That sweet man, boom, that was Orlando Sanchez is 300 pounds. Exactly. That's why it's crazy. That's why it's quite quick. Big that sits there. Look at this suite. We get a sweep leg up in the air and a hand to foot in between the legs and then he pushes the hip with his hand.

Speaker 2:          02:08:21       That's one of the greatest sweeps of all time. Of all time. The Shit. Look, look at this. So he gets hunger. He using his foot as he tucks him under and pushes him. I'd like to know what the amazing like to know where the left hand is left hand on the hip. Watch how he rolls when he rolls him. Watched his left hand, his right hand on top of the left hand seat on the hip. See it pushing where? Hushing hip though. Like it looks. It's hard. It's right here. You probably just getting anything that he can. It's flat. If you look at the way w w what was he? The left hand. His left hamstring has got to be so strong. Oh Dude. He's a gorilla. Left hamstring. Insane. Right? But he is excellent. Even just a hamstring cause he looks to me like his foot sideways and he'd watching.

Speaker 2:          02:09:00       He does it again. Look, it's foot is sideways like a sidekick. Look, look at that. I mean it's like he's going against the inside of the leg. This is what's even crazier. The strain is like the abductor muscles. He's going like this way. That's another look at, look at his left leg blocking dude's left arm ours, right? Like I'm sorry, the right leg. Right, right. Yeah. It's amazing. Yeah. And that guy he just swept is an adcc gold medalist and 300 pounds and he's a really good wrestler. He's a black belt in Jujitsu. That right then that shit that he should just leave that on a loop at of school. Yeah. You know what I mean? Well, cyborgs of gorilla. He's got an ma. Did you see ever see it as strength and conditioning routines? I know that motherfucker doesn't play, dude. He's a real law.

Speaker 2:          02:09:44       He's a goal. All the top guy. Oh yeah. I just saw a Andra Galvao doing dead lifts today. Yes, garage. He, let me ask you this. Is it better to just let the deadline, I was going to ask you that because of that. When he dead lifts, is that best way to do it? You tell me. I don't know. Shit. I don't know shit either. I would always think that the negatives are important. I mean the negatives for me are very important. Like for Chin ups, I go way slower going down. It seems like every six months there's a whole new philosophy on I'm strength I can. It's totally the opposite of the last one. So crazy. It's like now the big thing is, you know with intermittent fasting it's like, okay, there's all these diets and eat this and gluten that and all that and then now the new diet is donated for 18 hours and no, it's not crazy. That is crazy, dude. That shit works. You know what's great about that is it makes you have

Speaker 3:          02:10:34       a time every day where you can have the most fabulous meal ever. Cause when I, when I eat, I'm starving and salads taste. So good luck. I want a big key. I of a double salad. Yeah. And when you're not, when you're not that hungry, it fee it now. Now I feel like if I'm not that hungry, I don't want to waste a meal because it's so much better when you're starving and you're out of control. Yeah. I eat that way most of the time, except on days when I know I have a really brutal workout in the morning, like a weight lift and work. I'll run fasted, I'll do yoga fasted. But if I'm going to lift, I want to have something I need. I need some fruit or some, it's almost three right now. I haven't eaten at all and I'm fine. I'm fine. You know, it's a, it's a, it's um, interesting diet.

Speaker 3:          02:11:25       I hope it isn't bullshit. No, it's definitely not bullshit. I was never a morning person either. Like I never did. I never really looked forward to breakfast was always add and have I got protein bar or something just cause I had to, did you ever listen to my podcast? I did with Dom D'agostino. He's a scientist from, I think he's University of Florida. Um, but uh, a key to genic specialist does a lot of Quito research and research on fasting and the benefits of fasting and he goes into the scientific benefits, the proven benefits of fasting. Very, very interesting stuff. What did he, what were, what were the most I would really want to direct you to that. I want to fuck it up, but it's for a preventative cancer. Um, yeah. Ketone bodies in the blood and crease cognitive improvements. I just think we eat too much.

Speaker 3:          02:12:12       We eat too much meat all the time. So easy to know. I like watching TV and snacking, you know, watch a little netflix snacks. We all do. But if I'm watching Netflix and it's nine o'clock at night, I really shouldn't be eating. Isn't it weird that like popcorn became the official food watching movies? Isn't that weird? I know it's loud chewing shit. You can't hear dialogue and have no one likes to say, dude, let's go get some popcorn. No one, no one ever looks for popcorn and less they're at the movies. That's a good point. What is it only time? Maybe a Disneyland because it's like, Yay, I forgot about popcorn. Fucking and by that while I'm here too. Other than that, like the circus movie, circus, circus, popcorn, circus got peanuts into the mix. Maybe there's something about the popcorn that like it's like genetically modified and it's like it helps with the, with the brainwashing just in the palm court.

Speaker 3:          02:13:03       Yeah, probably do up to microwave, dude. That's what it is. They might exact curls and it fucks with your head Bro. Basically microwave, just kill everything. Right. When you might go into your food, you basically just don't have anything. It's just like, yeah, pop, pop. I'm not hung. Survived in a way. Right. Isn't it crazy that we haven't really improved upon micro? It's like they mastered that shit 40 years ago and it's still the same goddamn micro. I know it's really bad for you and they're going to take out of microwave popcorn. When you get popcorn,

Speaker 1:          02:13:32       there's fats in there that your body just doesn't know what the fuck to do with. That's where those things could sit on a shelf for so long. Those little packets, I think, what is it? What is the toxic ingredient in microwave popcorn that they're eliminating? It's hilarious. They decided, Oh, this shit kills you, but we're going to let you sell it for two more years. They didn't just make it illegal. They made a moratorium. I think it's trans fats. I think it just might be a vegetable. Oil Fats. There's certain certain trans fats that are just, your body's just like, what in the fuck is this non food? You're, you're making me. Yeah. We were talking about delicious protein bars before the show. That gives you the most unbelievable farts. That's how I know I shouldn't be eating, so if I'm, if I'm eating something and I'm just lighten the inside of my car on fire chemical here it is. Chemicals used in aligning of microwaveable popcorn bags including look per fluoro. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          02:14:31       acid or Pfo are part of a class of compounds that may be linked to infertility and humans. According to a recent study from Ucla and animal testing, the chemicals caused liver cancer, tech, testicular cancer and pancreatic cancer. So that's one thing, but I know that they banned trans fats. I might have conflated the two stories. Did that, cause what is the ban of trans fats is the one where they're giving them like all the like hostess cakes, those bullshit cakes that sit on the shelf forever. Ding dongs are my favorite. Those things, those, those pop, those pie cakes that you get from hosted to like the lemon filling, those are just trans fats to the gills. Twinkie method. They last 20 years or whatever. How long do they last? Twinkie like you and I were laying around in fucking bored, smoked a little weed, watching some TV and up to God.

Speaker 1:          02:15:23       I'm so hungry. When he got here, man cabinet and you had like ring dings, twinkies and my grab a twinkie. If I'm starving laying around watching survival chillin, I might eat a twinkie. These are like the worst wedding cake. It's just, well, you know what I had last night at strawberry shortcake, US popcorn makers could face long, expensive road to lose trans fats. Okay? This is why I conflated it. Microwave popcorn makers could face a long and difficult task. Ridding their snacks of trans fats, US Food and Drug Administration proposal to ban the additive goes into effect. So you s is banning. So the u s ban on Trans Fats is what I uh, what I got confused with us ban on trans fats is like a, they're given these people like two years. Isn't it crazy that they're there? They're going to make it a big deal out of this.

Speaker 1:          02:16:13       They're going after the trans fats, but they don't go after like, like, like real shit. Like alcohol is like killing people all day every day. I know, right? It's like you, you say, why don't you say this is going to kill you if you keep eating it, but it's awesome but you're going after trans fats. Maybe it's like someone, someone in the popcorn industry just pissed off and I illuminati Mammogram, you know where to go after him. And this, is this like a smear campaign? Trans Fats, danger? No, they're bad for you once they know they're bad for you. But what about just take him, what about the, that one drug that everyone's getting addicted to that's legal. Uh, adderall. No, it's, it's a Carolyn. It's morphine. No, no, no. Very popular. Very popular prescription. Oxycontin. Oxycontin for sure. Fuck your life up 100% but he have serious pain. It also leaves yeates pain. And the thing is, can you, can you just write it for a few and they're going after trans fats here. It's crazy.

Speaker 1:          02:17:13       Let them have their popcorn. Fuck Aa. They're going, they're making like news articles about it. [inaudible] after Trans Fat. What about the 800 kids that go missing every year? What about, why don't you cold weld? Different people go look for that. Okay, that's true. But these are different people. These are food scientists. But I think the point is that this stuff that there's other ways to make food, but the thing is, I don't know what is the benefits of Trans Fats? Does it make processing easier? Like, why do they use that as opposed to like other healthy fats? I don't know why. It probably has something to do with shelf life maybe. Yes, probably. That's probably why it fucks you up too. You got to think about what a preservative is. You know, like someone was explaining, did you see, uh, what's wrong with wheat or what's with wheat?

Speaker 1:          02:17:52       Did you see that documentary? Maybe they were talking about roundup and glyphosate and they were talking about roundup, this stuff that they spray on some plants that they said, well don't worry, this only affects a bacteria. Yeah, and so they said that, well, this one, they were creating it and this is one of the reasons why they allowed it to be used, but what they are explaining in this documentary, it's just, I don't know if it's true or not, but what they were explaining was, yeah, you have bacteria in your body dummy. Like you're taking this stuff into your body. They didn't say it that way. You have bacteria in your body. You're taking this stuff into your body that only kills bacteria. It's going to kill a part of your body. Like your body is partly bacteria. In fact, there's more bacteria cells in your body than there are human cells.

Speaker 1:          02:18:32       That's just a fact of being a person. So this is a crazy thing that they don't know that and they either know it and they did it anyway or they didn't know that in which the case, what you were saying earlier, they should have no business telling people what's the good science and the bad science if they allow that to go through it. Yeah. That's another example of bad science. Yeah, well it's definitely example of maybe they didn't know when they first came up with the stuff, but as technology has advanced, they haven't eliminated it either way. Whether they didn't know or they did know and there was a diabolical plan, whatever it is, it's just, it's that science is bogus. Yeah, but should you be allowed like we know diet cokes, terrible for you. Should you be allowed to sell diet coke if you want, but just most do most people know how bad diet coke is for you or Diet Soda?

Speaker 1:          02:19:20       I should say the most people know. Most people don't. Most people don't. They don't know. Mostly Park. I'll have a diet every now and again once a month or so I'll have a diet coke. I been pretty good at keeping sodas at my life now. We discovered a, the Pellegrino. Yeah. Pellegrinos great. Yeah, just water. I love it. I used to struggle with being at a restaurant and you're struggling with, should I just drink water or can I get a fucking, I'm gonna have a coke and then I have to coax and then I feel guilty all night. Uh, that struggle went on my whole life, dude. I been drinking way too much. Water. Pellegrino, the Pellegrino that tie that in Perrier, that, that satisfies me enough. ZV is a good one too. And um, there's a couple of other like flavored waters. They're like more carbonated.

Speaker 1:          02:20:11       It's carbonated water. Ah, the Cla, the Cla is Pellegrino and carbonated waters. Is that bad for you? Is that gonna is that gonna come out that we get cancer from that are the bubbles fucking me up. They are not good for your teeth. What do they do? The bubbles, just as bad as soda. Water is. I mean it's just not good for your, it's soda isn't Pellegrino has settled water. It's the same thing. And carbonated water is bad for your teeth and mass amounts. I mean like one or two, probably not a bad thing. So we'll just drink it about once it gets in your stomach that do the bubbles, do the bubbles like fuck you up. Gas, Illuminati Bro. They're all ideas. Those, those ideas in those bubbles getting you to buy into bonds. Who knows? Who knows? Maybe maybe they find out that the bubble of your guns, your system do something, uh, bad for Ya.

Speaker 1:          02:20:58       Yeah, right. I mean, I wouldn't be surprised. I hope not shit out. It's completely benign because I turned her, we've heard about the shit out of it. I do too. Here along as it's playing carbonated water with no added citric acid or sugar, the answer is no. The process of carbonation is simple. Addition of pasteurized, pressurized carbon dioxide, gas into plain water acids, sugars and salt, or not being added. It's the addition of those ingredients that ups your risk for tooth decay. So no harm at all. So it's just carbonated water is just carbon dioxide gas or maybe that's an Illuminati. Dude, stop freaking me out, man. Did you know the funguses fucking like mushrooms? They breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide like we do. Does that make it make it good? It's like an animal more than it is like a plant.

Speaker 1:          02:21:44       They're closer to animals than they are to plants. A fungus, fungus or like an animal. Almost. Not really because it doesn't move. I mean, but it's closer to the animal wrangler moves shit. Yeah. Fuck that fungus. That's the worst man. That's the worst. But like mushrooms are there. There's some sort of other thing. They're not a plant funguses and a different kind of thing, uh, from another fucking planet, man. That's what I think. You think mushrooms aren't legal right? They're not. There's that recreational mushrooms are the ballot for 2000 coming California. Any states already legalized my, but they should. They should do it the same way they do what

Speaker 2:          02:22:26       they're going to eventually do with Mtma. Look, mushrooms are great, and remember the first time you, and I remember the first time you and I did mushrooms, you were living at your old house. We were chilling in the backyard, dude, and we to do the talking about life wasn't that much. It a small dose, but it was enough to go whoa. Like it just gave me a better perspective. It's just opened up my mind to that. I was, I was relying on all the patterns that had been explained to me about life to be correct instead of like looking at it with fresh eyes. And I felt like at 30 years old, it was the first time I was able to look at my, my life with fresh eyes, look at life itself and go, oh, this is just this weird temporary experience eating your comedy, tear your comedy.

Speaker 2:          02:23:10       Just, you know, from, from the early Joe Rogan, like your first CD somebody someday I'm going to be dead. Right. I'm going to be dead someday. I'm going to be dead someday. From that comedy to the once you started getting into psychedelics, big o difference. Yeah. It changes who you are cause well, it also makes you super humble because even if I don't appear humble, um, when you, when you get hit by that, that the big dose, whatever it is, dmt or whatever you do, when you get hit by that dose, you realize you are just a part. You're not the big thing. It is a part of something that is indescribably big. And the idea that you're important or that you're the most significant thing around you, it's pretty ridiculous. Like you gotta do your best to keep your body alive and do your best to do your part and whatever the fuck you do for a living, do your best at that.

Speaker 2:          02:23:58       But you're just a part of something that's infinite. Did your experience with mushrooms and Dmt, did that make you think like there's gotta be a creator to all this? Not that there's a creator like a guy in a lab. It's like making a person inside of a fucking yes to not not a creator in a sense of an individual, but I think that the idea of an individual became more ridiculous than anything. It's like I understand that like what we are is almost like something filtered through these predetermined like almost like we're a membrane, like something from another dimension expresses itself through this physical membrane and then we're almost like the barrier to what comes out on the other side that this was the thought that I had when I was on mushrooms, that what we are as as as a person is almost like the the carrier, like a vehicle for whatever a soul is and that this thing uses this life to pass that, that thing through onto another experience that happens in the next dimension that'll be so fucking alien that you can't even imagine it today in this dimension and this dimension would be alien to that dimension that it was just this never ending infinite process of soul traveling.

Speaker 2:          02:25:15       I had this very bizarre, like thought about like if you, like people will often say like if you had to live your life over again, you are born tomorrow. You got to do

Speaker 1:          02:25:24       it all over again. Could you do it? You'd be like, what? Oh my God, I got to start over from scratch. How can I be a baby again and rely on those same fucking people again? Oh my God, I got to go back to first grade. That was terrible. That's when my parents broke up and Oh, and people start freaking out and thinking, but you already did it. You already did it. What'd you have to do it forever? Could you do it forever, forever and ever and ever over and over and over and over and over again. Could you do that? Like reincarnation? You might be doing that. That might be just as possible. What, what hit me? Is this just as possible that you've lived this life and infinite number of times and you can continue to live this life and in front number of times. And when you do, maybe so you're saying there's a possibility that we have some kind of soul type thing, right? Some kind of sauce ability that you're on a loop. Just like those, those youtube videos, are those a instagram videos, a Cyborg hitting that? Yeah, that sweep. So we're on a lifeline.

Speaker 3:          02:26:13       If so, if there is a loop and it say either, either it's involuntary or voluntary. Either you say either when you die, you wake up and go, Whoa, that was an awesome ride. Let's do it again. Or it just happens automatically. And you did you get the choice either way. Maybe you do, maybe you don't. Some spiritual gurus say that, yes, some people choose, some souls choose to keep coming back. Some stay in the infinite heavens forever or whatever, and then come back some every now and then, who knows what's real. But, um, you're, you're talking about there's some kind of soul thing and there's either a, you're pro, you're, you're, you're saying that this probably an involuntary reincarnation of some sort. Yeah. Right. So, so maybe possible. Maybe either if, if you decide to come back for sure. If that's the case, you would, you would say, okay, I'm going to, I'm going back in to that earth realm and you for sure don't want to know where you came from that it would seem, I'm guessing that the beauty of life is after you dying, you realize what the hell.

Speaker 3:          02:27:20       Oh, that's right. You, you don't want to know. It's like watching a movie. Like I'm, the other day I watched a movie and I'm watching the trailer and 30 seconds into the trailers unsane the movie at 30 seconds I stopped it because I didn't want to watch the rest of the trailer because now, okay, I got enough. I want to see this thing. I didn't want to see more of the trial because I wanted to go to the movie and be full. I didn't want to know what was going on. I wanted to be confused, right? I didn't want to fit, be able to figure something out from a trailer. So, and most people are like that. I'm not special. Like if you went to a movie and you already saw your buddy didn't and you told them how it ended, he would sock you right in the chest. Fuck you doing. You just ruined the movie from you. Faggot. You know what I mean? Strong word. But I mean that I don't mean that in a homosexual. I'm sorry. I'm just trying to be funny and I apologize to all gay people out there. I apologize. I love gay people. I love gay people. Um, there was just me trying to express an emotion, but a, and no one's also at the same time going to go to a movie with the, have you already signed say dude, before it starts telling me the whole movie. Better

Speaker 1:          02:28:18       analogies that you never get a chance to see the future. You're not going to get a chance to see the future

Speaker 3:          02:28:21       once you're reborn again. This life when you come back, do you want to have a memory of your past and you don't, you don't get it. It's a part of the system. I think it's either, whether it's voluntary or involuntary, it's best to not know where you came from at first. It's best to figure it out. That's probably what this is all about is figuring it out. Cause when we go to the movie, part of it is it's all about the journey. It's not about the destination. People always use that as a, you know, an instagram. It's not about the journey or thought about the destination. It's the journey. That's one of the most popular saying it's ever and it's beautiful. You have to say it every now and then to remind you, remind the rum. Well My, another thing to remind you, you don't even think about it as a journey.

Speaker 3:          02:29:01       Just be in the moment except the moment and be in the moment. Live in the moment thinking about the future plan for the future, but exist in the moment. You know, don't think of it as a journey or a destination, but the people that are the most fucked or the people that are trying to make it one day I'm going to make it. And then when you make, there's no making. It never happens. It doesn't, it doesn't change. It doesn't matter if you're an illusion. I fell for it. Hook, line and sinker. Oh my God. The the wanting to be a rock star my whole life. They got me good. I wanted that man shit. Oh, I was going to have that mansion and just filled with the shakes and that's what I was after my whole life. They got me good. When I saw kiss and I saw that shit, I'm like, I want that.

Speaker 3:          02:29:43       I knew, right, right. When I saw kiss meets the phantom of the park, 1978 on NBC, one of the worst movies of all time. It just blew me the fuck. Oh, he was a power outage. I was watching it at home and the power went out and I was devastated. The weird thing about that, that Arrow's 1978 and if you followed kiss, if you were older, I was eight and if you followed kiss and you know from 73 on, they already had their early cool years and then after kiss alive that a few more awesome albums and then they got to the point where I started doing disco and that was 1978 that's when I got into them when they started doing disco. So I didn't, I didn't even know what selling out was. I just heard I was made for loving it and I loved it.

Speaker 3:          02:30:25       You know what I mean? I had no idea. But um, man, I don't even know where my fucking point was. What were we talking about? I don't remember either. The point was you're never going to get to know what the future holds. You just going to be living your life and that's how it is with everybody. I don't remember what the fuck your point was. Swallow the rockstar thing Roxanne to be a rock star. They get you. They get, you can, there's so many different ways they can, like, you get your, you get yourself too. I mean, you gotta, you gotta think about what you're exposed to, but look, it's like, like music videos, what they sell in music videos. They sell that. It's like they're offering it. The book I got and a lot of those rappers that are flashing on the cash, it's not even their money.

Speaker 3:          02:31:04       It's not even there, their mansion. But it's pushing that you like pushing, like you want to do whatever it takes, whatever it takes to make it. I was so zeroed in on that, you know me? Yep. Up until up until a few years ago, I was zeroed in on it. Uh, then I began to realize, wow, they got me real. God damn good. You know, I was obsessed with some, some, uh, an illusion. Fame is an illusion. Obsessed with the destination instead of the journey. Right. Well, I enjoyed the journey, but it was like you're obsessed with, it was all about conquering the music business. That's all it was about. And it's not about that anymore, obviously. Thank God, thank God I sucked musically because if I would've had a record deal and my 20s shit, I have did some crazy illuminati shit back then, I would did whatever I like, whatever.

Speaker 3:          02:31:52       Just I would have been to those parties with the crazy mask and been doing. I'm like, let's go have parties with the crazy shot. They just let you think. Guidewire hit album. They're like, hey, Eddie Brown, come off California. Come on down. Thank God my music sucked because I would have went along with all that shit in my twenties I was so obsessed. I was so obsessed with making it in the music business. I would have did any of the home, but you wouldn't have done that. Gone part of the Jimmy Savile. I would have been hanging out with whoever was famous, you know shares. Well, you know it's like retirement is a lesser example that people are always looking to those golden years. One day I'm going to retire and I with our hands at the sunset like, no, you're thinking about death then we don't do shit anymore.

Speaker 3:          02:32:38       You don't have nothing to do. You know? The only time you should think about retirement is if you have a job that you can retire and they pay you still and then you can go do whatever the fuck you want. That's what you should be thinking about retiring. But thinking about is this time where heindel leave, we get to relax, she put our feet up and then they turn you into soylent green, turn you in a foot. That's what you were really green aiming for and it, you know, and everyone is is a working t to get that vacation and some far away beach where they can have a beer and the destination is that they go far away at least five to eight hours. You gotta you gotta you can't just use, you can't just use that to get just, you have here these beaches don't count it.

Speaker 3:          02:33:15       They count for people and not on the east coast. They count cause they come here but you live here so it doesn't count. You got to get on a flight and get on it. Go to a Goddamn beach. It looks just like Malibu. Just like you got to trap you. Got to go across the country go, you've got to go to Fiji, the Ocean Masco chasing that beach, and then what are you gonna do on that beach? The first thing you're going to do is check to see if there's internet as the first hacking thing you're going to do. It's an illusion and then every time you go to the airport you see that picture of like some dude just lay in there on some deserted beach. Like that's even possible. I thought that was possible. I thought it might've deserted like a deserted that you have your own deserted beach, you know that your genome, see that I off camera, out of the frame of the picture is a bunch of people trying to sell you a, an inner tube and some just, you know, people trying to rip you off and sell you shit.

Speaker 3:          02:34:04       They don't show that part. They just show your feet, your feet in a beer. If you have a perfect beach like that, you're going to sell it to a bunch of people. And it's not just to be this one dude. Unless you one of those Richard Branson guys, that's when you go full or you got your own beach Wa yes, yes. You have that. Those, those only exist for Jay z. You know what I mean? You've got to buy an island. Richard Branson type dudes or Tyler Perry. He's got an island and it just seems like these vacations are all like rip offs. I remember me and my wife went to Cabo San Lucas and we looked at the package and like, Oh shit, let's get this resort. There's five different restaurants. Amazing. All inclusive. This is amazing. You get there and it's the same kitchen, five different restaurants, but only one is open at a time.

Speaker 3:          02:34:46       They just take different shifts and it's the same waiters, the same food. Oh, you to come up bunk ass place. I've got to send you to some good places. There's a good place in uh, in Cabo. It's called the one and only [inaudible] never go back there again. Cabo was amazing. I love it. Oh Man. Everyone's trying to rip you off growing up. Yeah, that happens. What about Hawaii? Hawaii. Yeah. If someone goes on vacation, someone gave me a nonstop first class ticket to Hawaii and a five star hotel for two weeks, I wouldn't go. Why not? I've traveled so much. It's an illusion to me. I want to use up all my shit much. I want to sit in my house and look out the window and she'll fuck. Yeah. You know, that's what I want to chill. I want to be with my family. I want to be with my son.

Speaker 3:          02:35:34       That's an illusion. They have, you know, I'm going to travel with my family for them, but I've traveled so much. To me it's an illusion. I've never been to a place where, um, I was pissed that I was leaving. I was always ready to go. Like, dude, I'm ready. You want to change our flights and leave early? Shit, when we went to Cabo, we change our flights and left early. It sucked. Wow. Like what are you gonna sit on a beach? We got that right here. We go to Santa Monica. He had a free vacation we've made. We got, me and my family get hotels because my son loves hotels. We'll just get a hotel in Burbank, like a VIP hotel in Burbank where you've got like this gigantic room and we stayed there for for a day. You got to just do w we'll talk after the podcast.

Speaker 3:          02:36:10       You can do vacations the right way. There's ways that you could do go zip lining in Costa Rica. Dude, I got tricked into going to Costa Rica. I told you that. I'll never go to Costa Rica ever again. Okay, that's good. Unless it's for a seminar. I'll go for a seminar. Like could you just to seminar, but I ain't trying to go to the jungle and anything like that. Fuck that shit. We've got to wrap this up because I'm going to Piss my pants.
