Speaker 1:          00:00:02       And we already live. Yeah. Damn. Watch me tweet and talk at the same time. You know there's a lot of guitar players that can do that. Tweet and guitar. Yeah, they can sing and talk at the same time. Me, I can't even type and talk at the same time and I don't have to keep any kind of spelled experience wrong. Do you sing and talk at the same time? It seems like sing, sing and play guitar at the same time. But they'll also play guitar and like could he keep playing the song and then talk to you about some something? You know what I mean? Like, like I know man, when you get down they need to make up left and they're still playing the exact, you know, some of their, their brain can, can do both at the same time. It's like drummers, I don't get that.

Speaker 1:          00:00:44       Like a drummer has like one beat on one leg, one beat on the other leg. How God damn impressive. His diocese, kid Max is a fucking beast. Really? Oh my God, Dude. We had Max Silverstein. He came on the show with dice and we played a video of it and I had seen him do it live when we went to dicer show cause he does, he does like the, his band does a song before dice comes out. So I knew that the kid could play the drums, but there's a video of him at the comedy lab next to the Improv and who show was it on a, I don't know, whatever it was, the fucking kids and sane. I mean, he's not just good at the drums. He's sick. I mean he's, he's, it looks like a fucking professional. Really? Oh, it's amazing man. The hand eye coordination is ridiculous.

Speaker 1:          00:01:35       I mean, he fucking goes off on this solo and he nails it. He nails it perfect. And it's one of those, one of those moments, you're like, that kid's a bad mother fucker. That kid could be a bad motherfucker at anything he wants. He wants his fucking dad did a great job raising him, man. That, that kid loves his father. You know, that is a beautiful thing to watch Dyson as kid for real. He loves his fucking kids, man. And they love him and they're all empowered. Like his son is super confident, young and strong and smart and you know, he's, he's fucking got a real shot, a real shot, you know, without anybody's help. Just from talent, just from the, you know, the, the ability to play drums like that. You can do that. I really believe you could apply that shit to anything.

Speaker 1:          00:02:27       And if you go to a on it and use the coupon code, Rogan it yourself. So Alpha brain, and they learned to function on my level son. So seamless people will make fun of me for this Alpha brain. But you can all go fuck yourself if you take it and you don't see any results. I think there's something wrong with your brain needed to go to a doctor and you could find out or you need to get that from I Tommy buns. He just held up his arms and shut his wrong. She's throwing phones around this rappels apples. It's really a fucking guns around this room. Ah, no. So for, for Real, what is Alpha brain? It's really the, it's all bad. It's best explained on, on at.com cause it was written by sober people first of all. And second of all, people who understand science other than my level of understanding, which is repeating shit that other people understand, but I don't ever really understand.

Speaker 1:          00:03:19       He believes in evolution. Um, well I think there is certainly a lot of evidence for natural selection and adaptation and that it's most likely the way things have evolved, but there's some holes in it. There's some holes. Yeah, we'll talk about it. Kind of a question for talking about this. The middle of a commercial. Hey Man. Well I thought this way, this ship roles here, I want to thank God it's Icom for supporting us while we got hacked recently folks. And uh, we uh, had to like severely upgrade our, uh, her um, uh, technical system, whoever it is that the website interfaces with.

Speaker 2:          00:03:53       Uh, I learned something new passwords. If you use like a regular word as a password and it may be a number, you know, that's okay. But the hardest thing that would take like, I forget like 32 years for a computer to hack is if you just take three random words and put them together, like Taco fart handicap or something like that. Yeah. And that way the computer will never just the odds that we'll get to that point, it was like 32.

Speaker 1:          00:04:22       Well yeah, but then they'll just have a new computer search engine and now they were like, yeah, what bitch? And they'll nail it quick or we just got the capital and lowercase thing. I don't think that matters like zero. Most things aren't case sensitive. Yeah. But uh, either way on it.com spelled o and n I t and if you go there and today is the 11th, September 11th. And uh, if you go there for one more day, use the code, got your back and you get 18% off of everything. That includes kettle bells and battle ropes because normally the coupon, a coupon code of Rogan only works for the supplements. It doesn't work for the kettle bells in the battle ropes. The reason being is that we sell those literally as cheapest as humanly possible, but because of this fuck up, because the fact that everybody feels terrible that this website got hacked.

Speaker 1:          00:05:13       The, we don't know whether or not anybody's a credit card information got compromised so far. No one has a reported any what they call substantiated fraud, I think they call it, but uh, whatever it is, some scumbags figured out a way to get into our system. It's just, I don't understand the way they do it. I completely talking like I'm explaining French to you though. I don't speak French so I could never really comment. But as far as I know, I mean it's really, I think for a lot of these guys it's fun to see how they can sneak into systems even if the not stealing anything. I think script kids that are just really bright and they figured out how to sneak into your system. It's all against the hunt man. They're like trying to see how far they can get it and then you have to some hacker.

Speaker 1:          00:06:00       Is she the other day? What'd you do? I'll talk poll. Let me, yeah, let me just get through with this. So because of that, because everybody's very bummed out about that and that you're, uh, you know, the credit card information has been compromised and if you go to [inaudible] dot com forward slash breach, it'll explain all that. It's just an unfortunate aspect of doing business on the Internet. We apologize and nobody, uh, nobody foresaw it this way. Uh, we've beefed up the security considerably, so hopefully it won't happen again. Whoever hacked this, please don't do that. Thanks. You don't have to do that. That's mean, I know you can do it. Okay. We know you can do it. Please don't do it. I don't want anybody to get caught and go to jail for something stupid like that. And you know, and if that's how you're making your money, how dare you go get a fucking respectable job.

Speaker 1:          00:06:43       You son of a bitch, you're stealing numbers from offline. You can't do that. I'm a big fan of you guys. Whoever you are, I want to give a shout out Favell shout outs. So anonymous. Well, sec shout out right out to the hackers of the world. Yeah, man, look that, you know, there's a certain, there's a certain amount of morals that are on the Internet when it comes to how things get done as well. You know, there's, there's a, there's a moral attitude at the Internet and then I think more mirror society than it does. Uh, the shit that you see on television, the shade that you see in the news, you know, there's a link when anything goes down. The difference between like, Dan, we shouldn't do this in a commercial. Joe Joe rogan.net. That's my website. Go to [inaudible] dot com use the other phone.

Speaker 1:          00:07:29       You know, that's not for today though. Do not sponsor us to that. That it's only a part time thing with the thing. We're just trying it out. Seeing how it works is the phone. It's phenomenal though that Samsung Galaxy s three is fucking is to shit. It's really sweet. It's sexy. It's amazing. It's really great. It's got a little for you every now and then. A little hiccup here and there, but it's really special. I needed to phone. It's a special phone. What's the queefs about? It wasn't it? And it just seems like I'm, I think they're, the iPhone is a really well designed phone man tomorrow. The way it is it tomorrow the light comes out, the way the, the, the touch screen first of all is better than anything on the planet. They're the best touchscreen. The quality of it feels better than anything.

Speaker 1:          00:08:14       Like when you'd have the case on an iPhone and you just feel that knowing glass, it's like the sexiest piece of equipment ever. But you got to walk around with a condom on it because, you know, it's so breakable. But, but it's still super duper fucking sexy. I mean, hold on to that thing. I mean feel that that's a genius piece of device. And so it's, that phone is to always a little better than everything I've tried. The way it interfaces, just cleaner, smarter makes more sense, easier to find shit. It's just better. It's like our Tiffany jewelry, my phone really started taking a shit the most today really. And it's totally because it comes out to my apple sending out electronic. The Joe Rogan experience is brought to you by on a.com going Oh, and it, we've got to get this podcast start, this ridiculous. That's it.

Speaker 1:          00:09:03       We're not brought to you by anyone else. Go to death squad.tv though, and pick up some, some funky sexy cat shirts. It has been proven that you are 20% more likely to get your penis touch if you weren't a desk. What captured 20% 43% with alcohol. You add a desk, squad shirt and alcohol, and someone's going to touch your penis. And this is a blind study. Yeah, it's like three out of five times someone's touching your penis. Okay. All right. I feel good for you. I feel like the odds are strong. Thompson Gore is here. You dirty bitches. Let's get it. Poppin Brian Experience.

Speaker 1:          00:09:44       Oh, sweetness. Tommy buns in the fucking house. Ladies and gentlemen. It's Tommy like it's good to have you buddy. We were about to, uh, just talk nonsense and go through commercial and Tommy buns hits me with, do you believe in evolution? Thrown heavy handed question. That's so fucking right hand bombed the open the round. Well it's just funny to me cause I was watching this thing about and this guy was like, this guy I can believe in evolution should be taught in the classrooms and it was like a political ad like that. Like that that appeals to somebody. They're like, yeah, fuck that guy. He thinks evolution be fucking asshole. You're like, really? There's that. There's actually enough people that believe like I, I'm not a science expert so I don't want anyone to think like, wait a minute, you're about to, you're not a science expert.

Speaker 1:          00:10:43       I know. I mean I know. What price point do you become an expert because if you were just you and you lived in the 14 hundreds you'd be a fucking science x. You're probably right. They'd be like, electricity is God's way of showing you his anger. You're like, well no, actually it's just some shit that's formed by from the lives of the atmosphere and my president. You'd be a fucking scientist. You could explain so much shit to these people. Well actually I would just know it and not know how to explain it though. Would just be like, no, no, you drive, you drive round. And they'd be like, how have you known? I'd be like, just cousins scene. You would, you would work with those people for a couple of days and you'd be so annoyed. You're like, listen, you have to listen to me. I'm your new king and I'm going to show you how to build an airplane.

Speaker 1:          00:11:25       They'd be like an airplane. What the fuck you talking about? Get some, get someone I'm going to show you you need this has gotta be straight like that. Think like a bird. But then with the tail up in the air air draft from above and below you go to go. Where did you get this idea from? I Dunno man. They just come to me to just come to me. You draw like bows and arrows for like Davinci was like from the future and went to the past. I think the Davinci too many ideas. You know what people love to say when there's a guy like Davinci, they go and I wanted to sit, just say it just of instinct. It's probably had like Asperger's or something. They always want to say something like that. Like that. There's no way you could be close off with that guy that brilliant and not be fucked up.

Speaker 1:          00:12:03       Like I'm not willing to believe it, you know? I don't think that, I mean keeping like, I almost agree that like I don't think you could go to Davinci and be like, how do you like your eggs man? And He'd be like, you know, actually like I think he would be talking about all kinds of weird shit. Like thinking about what you would look like if you cleaved you in half and pulled, you could draw those two sides. You want to donate your body like today and you're like, no. And I dead yet. Did you ever see that exhibit, that bodyworks exhibit where they take human bio together? Yeah, that's right. It's crazy. It is creepy as fuck dude. And they were stopping us from taking pictures over. They told us to put our phones away. I had to take camera and pictures on the sneak tip.

Speaker 1:          00:12:41       Yeah. We're like, no, flash a horse. Remember the horse, they had this like real horse. It had been like, well, what was fucked up was that if you did this, if you haven't seen it, folks, the body works exhibit is a in the exhibit where they take a bunch of death dead bodies and through some new method of uh, somehow or another coating them with plastic and then fusing plastic into the muscles. It doesn't change the appearance, but it completely stops them from decaying. So it's really creepy. They give you the different acts years. Yeah, so they give you like a portion. Yeah. That's what's really fucked up is the clinical aspect of the dissection of the bodies on display was a little disturbing because it was almost like butcher ask. It's like if this was a guy's basement, you would want him locked up forever.

Speaker 1:          00:13:31       Okay. This guy would be one of the most horrific serial killers and twisted fox ever. Ever. Even if it was a grave robber and he did this, you would want this motherfucker locked up forever, but you can do it and somehow because you've involved plastic, which means that it's been like government sanctioned or something. Now you can just display these dead bodies and people can come and pay. Like how, where did you get these bodies? Exactly. And all you need. It's not even like under heavy scrutiny of some of them had like bullet wounds or something. Does that exhibit even still around? It's got a smell by now. The one that I saw, I saw it in Vegas. Um, it was at, I think it was luck. Sore. Yeah. Yeah. And um, and too much sadness for one day at the end they said that all the bodies in that exhibit were from China.

Speaker 1:          00:14:20       Yeah. Wow. Yeah. Oh my God. Yeah. That's scary because when you're, when you're from a country that has been known to do some really horrific things to like prisoners and Shit, pretty questionable track record when it comes to human rights. Well, there doesn't seem to be that there's that many of them in China. And so it's, I mean, uh, or rather that there's too many of them in China and there's so many people that in some areas the overpopulation, it's gotten to a point where they've sort of devalued life and a lot of, I mean, when you start hearing the stories about them, you know, forcing them to only have one child. And so this terrible stories of families drowning, uh, Chinese girls, it's really horrific because they want a boy fucking crazy. And you know, if that's propaganda though. So I really honestly shouldn't be, well outside of like, outside of the major cities, there's a lot of like extra like out in the countryside, which is hundreds of millions of people, there's extreme poverty, there's extreme literacy.

Speaker 1:          00:15:24       There's, you know, there's not any healthcare or anything. It's just the hundreds of millions of people outside of the major cities. When you, I mean that kind of poor, I mean we have the, we just haven't figured that out yet. I don't, I don't, I don't think most Americans are really like put that into their head. Like that level, the level of poverty that exists in other countries. We have extreme poverty, but it's, you know, there's, it's not like really what you see. Yeah. In third we have horrific poverty, but even just existing in a welfare state is way better than a giant chunk of the world has access to. You know, if you think about like what, what it would be like if you just had a shit roll the dice and you wound up in Nigeria. Yeah. You're a baby in Nigeria and it's just flies and mosquitoes and malaria is, and a dude's got a Hyena on a chain and you're like, what the fuck would you, most of Africa is fucking crazy.

Speaker 1:          00:16:19       Really wild, crazy place man. I just got back from there. Did you really? Just in South Africa. Oh that's right. You were doing gigs out there. Yeah, it was awesome. It was so cool. People were so nice. Crowds were fucking awesome. And then I met other Africans that were in South Africa and I learned like that's the destination. Like if you live in Botswana, Mozambique, Namibia, you go like I want to go to South Africa. That's the, that is the crown jewel of it. Cause that's the most developed like by far, by far, by far. And like when I was in, uh, I was in the casino walking through it with this comic who is from, I think he was from a former, what is he from? He's from Nigeria or somewhere, I don't know. Mozambique, I think. And I was like, uh, so what's like, you know your country?

Speaker 1:          00:17:08       Like he was like, man, he's like, you, you know how you picture Africa? And I was like, yeah. He's like, that's what it's like. Like it's fucking open terrain and animals and tribal shit. And he goes, this shit right here. The casino, the only thing like this in my country is like where the king lives. What if that too, there's no shit like this at all. That's going to be so weird to have one city that's like on top of the ball and everything else. It's just as bad. Barely keeping it to air. They're barely keeping it together. Yeah, it was. Um, but it was, it was a, it was an awesome experience. People were the crowds, like so good, very like mixed crowds and just juiced for the shows. I mean, I would say out of 15 black coat jokes go fucking killed. They understand American black humor.

Speaker 1:          00:17:57       Totally. They got it. They totally get it. And they got it. They got everything. You got everything man. Wow. Um, did you find, did you find them to be like, um, into like harsh material or they just, it was interesting. All the, the local guys, we saw a bunch of some South African comics and a lot of them are, have very political material and because it's a very politically charged atmosphere, you know, you think about that, like they got democracy in 94 so it's Kinda like us, you know, you just fast forward like, you know, like the 60s and seventies really politically charged in America. Right. And then right. And then, you know, there's just like, it's fresh. So that's what everybody talks about. They talk about politics and things going on, but it's like South African politics. And then we go in and we'll talk about the mundane, like just silly, like observational shit.

Speaker 1:          00:18:49       And some of the local guys were saying that like that's so unusual for them. Like to that somebody would just talk about some like small observation they made because it's all about making an impact with like your observation about what's really going on in the world or in the country right now. You know, so everybody's a preacher. I mean there's a lot. He said that, look, you can go to like a, you can do it, go to a standup show in South Africa, that's all locals and they'll all hit on political shit. He said that's not uncommon at all. That's interesting. Is it funny? Did you find it funny? There's this guy, David cow is a South African comic and he was fucking tremendous. Yeah. I didn't even know what like, he was like, you know when somebody really good and you don't necessarily get the reference but you laugh anyways.

Speaker 1:          00:19:34       Like you don't even, you're like, you don't know, like I don't even know what that was. Right, right, right. You still laugh just cause he's just timing and it's funny. It was like that fucking devastated the place. Wow. Yeah. I mean he was so, but he was all like, it was all about south, like current shit in South Africa. Wow. And it was like, it was wonder if that would translate like if he did the u s I think he, I don't think it would, I don't think the act would, but I think he's good enough where he would just need to just figure it out. That was something that never happened with the Boston guys. There was a bunch of guys from Boston that Boston like no other place does like local material. Like my first 20 minutes was all local material because you knew it would work.

Speaker 1:          00:20:19       It was like almost like it was first of all there was a lot of really funny shit about Boston and people from Boston love laughing about Boston. Yeah. So that like everybody that was like really strong had such a Boston centric act like Steve Sweeney in Boston. I'll put him up there with the greatest standup performances of all time. I'm telling you, Steve Sweeney in Boston in the 80s, you to lay them down, do just boom, like he was Boland strikes crushing with this Boston material and he's just such a funny guy. He just such a funny guy and he had been through the, like the hard Boston club scene, you know, over a decade before I ever saw him. You know what I mean? He's just, he was just a bad motherfucker. Yeah. And that guy, you know, when he would go to California, he would lose like a big chunk of his act because he couldn't talk about that shit anymore. It was so frustrating to me. It was like, man, you could do that about anything. If you could hit that level of comedy, he could do that with anything. Yeah. That's the thing

Speaker 3:          00:21:24       that we all, everybody thought this by the way. We'd all, cause I was there, Christina was on the show to a finesse Mitchell, Ian Bagg, uh, Mitch Fatel, Brian Haner and we all watched David and we're like, he just goes to states why? And fucking like, you know, he needed to work like kind of week after week. Right. And just if he did that for just a few months, he would put together a stellar fucking act. I'm sure.

Speaker 1:          00:21:48       Well, I think now, especially because of the Internet, the guys that are coming up over the next 10 years has a lot of good guys. Yeah. And I think that a lot of these good young up and coming stands up, the standups have had a chance to see so many good acts online so that even if in their, in their area and their area is not so good. You know, like there's all, I'm Roman mentioning names, but there's some places you'll go and like, oh he's the funniest local guy. You should have him open for you and you have the guy open for you and he's fucking deaf. Just nonsense and just bad hacky tricks and you're like, oh cow. Riced but if you're in that community, all you really need a stage time. If you've got like access to, you know, you can watch the, the Kinison archives, he could see bill Hicks stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:22:33       She could see Stan hope. You can see David Tell, he could see Norton, you could see all these different comics online. You could sort of get at what do you enjoy, what do you enjoy? I know you don't enjoy it, what that guy's doing. So instead of thinking about like the hacky stuff that's in your neighborhood, you have access to all this stuff. Whereas like in this, the 80s when I started out, there was no access to that other than like cds and cassettes. It wasn't as immediate and it was more, it was way more difficult to sort of create a scene or to, you know, to, to get good without like a good scene around you. Yeah. Yeah. You know, I think, cause I always feel like I'm only as good as the guys that I see around me on a regular basis and the guys that I performed with other basis.

Speaker 1:          00:23:15       Yeah. So if you were stuck somewhere where you don't see a lot of good shit, it definitely would affect your game. Yeah. Because like when I see someone really good, like when someone's stand hopes in town or when a, I see ds go up and kill or you know, a towel or some, you know, someone I really respect and I see their act, I get so charged up, uh, it gives me energy to make things. Yeah, it definitely is. Yeah. That, that little juice, that little, the little squirt of just some push to get you forward. You know, that's so important for nothing. Like seeing great staying at when you were standing up and you see somebody great at the show you're at and you're like, fuck, I'm not a fan of

Speaker 2:          00:23:53       watching stand up. Like I like when I'm at the comedy clubs, I tried not to watch anybody.

Speaker 1:          00:23:58       I don't watch a lot of standup, but I do like if the, if I know there's somebody either I want to see, you know, or somebody I know and I'm like, oh, like a friend of mine or somebody who's like, you know, this person's really good. I don't sit through a whole shows but I'll watch that person. And sometimes it is like, man, that's fucking so exciting. You get pumped up about it. You're like, that's awesome. You get like, um, like it makes you want to work. I could watch Joey Diaz do a thousand sets in a row probably.

Speaker 2:          00:24:25       Well yeah there's definitely certain people but like if I'm like, you know, at the Improv or whatever, the ice house and there's like all these comics going up, I would not, I don't like sitting there watching them cause it seems like to me it just, it, I'm too scared of going there and then having that like something in the back of my head from somebody else or it seems like that's really,

Speaker 1:          00:24:44       I get it. I get anxiety when I, when I sit around I'm just watching like, uh, just comic after comic home, not get anxiety. I get like, man, I can't sit here right now. Like, I just get like, I'm like, I got, I got to get up, I got to, I can't sit through this if I think it's like if I sit and that's like a minute in and I'm like, ah, this is not going to be, this is not good. I have to get up and leave. You can't watch do it. So you can watch like Louis C K for fucking hours, but you can't watch a bunch of like, can't I want to say any names? But there's a certain group of people that, you know, you've, you've seen them do standup and you never going to understand it, but yet there's still bumping around and you might like be in the back of the room one day and they're on stage and you, you almost have a heart attack bucking up and out.

Speaker 1:          00:25:29       You got to get out of the room. They'll in fact you, I think, yeah, they will. Well, do you know this real thought behind? That sounds crazy, but it's, um, there's a schizophrenia, something happens to schizophrenia and I believe it's called Alef Renea and it's a, um, a very rare situation where people will go to visit crazy people and become crazy while they visited them. Really? Yeah. And um, they don't know. They don't know exactly what it is and they think it might be for mono, it might be, um, might be something in the way you interact with this person. But it has happened before where people have gone in to visit people who are fucking crazy and they, all of a sudden people were like, we're going to have to keep an eye on you and then boom. So it's just like almost by like the association with that person. But it could be that they were just always crazy as fuck. Nobody without, or you're with them. It's almost like when you, what's it called when you like Stockholm Syndrome where you start to, you start, I think that's what guys with your kid matters. Yeah. But I mean like it's like you, there's a certain exposure to that person that starts to affect your like on a deeper level. I don't know enough about how affect each other to really,

Speaker 3:          00:26:45       when I was in college, I was in psych one o one our teacher one day we were talking about, you know, you're going through all the basics and then he gets to schizophrenia and he was like, okay, he writes it on the board and he's like, schizophrenia is the worst thing that could ever happen to you. And then this kid in his class and our class raised his hand and he's like, Yup. And he's like, I have schizophrenia. I don't think it's the worst thing that could ever happen. And we were all like, oh, you're just pissed off the schizophrenia guy. And then he's like, well, what I meant was there are different stages of schizophrenia and that the worst one is the worst thing that could happen to you. Which one do you have? Like do you have? And he's like, ah, I have like a less like, you know, severe. And he was like, Oh yeah, that's not what I meant. But Nice. It'd be really bad if I to back pedal.

Speaker 1:          00:27:32       I'm trying to find the name of this, uh, this thing that, that we're, we're, it's happened before, so the rare case of people who've visited schizophrenia, but I can't, I can't seem to find, so I might, I might be talking a little bit of Shit because I'm just repeating some things that I think it was, I think it was Terence Mckenna, it turns from Canada lecturer. But, um, the idea was that I'm, one of the things that they think about some people when they start to lose their mind is that, um, it, it becomes a, a pheromonal problem when they're giving off this weird smell to people like this, uh, this, this, um, what does, uh, you know, how would you describe a fair amount of hormonal smell, I guess? And people treat them. We're there. It's a fence. Offensive. People treat them odd and they start thinking, why am I on, am I crazy?

Speaker 1:          00:28:22       And that, that tipping point is like really not that hard to do on some people. Really. Yeah. Because if you think about how you interact with people, I'm sure you've had times in your life where you've been a is socially awkward or you felt like real weird. It felt like real vulnerable little special when you were young. Brian, barely. You barely feel get one correct sentence yesterday with Kat von d. Come on that I looked over. He came in his pants three times. It's like, how are you doing today so far? I keep on thinking about it. Beautiful. I met with me, I saw a picture of you hugging her was just like, you're just in bliss. He look like, he was like, I'm actually touching her. I liked girls that think like that. Like the energy thing she said about, you know, I love girls that think like that.

Speaker 1:          00:29:08       That's a very nice person and she's incredibly artistic. She's a bad ass bitch so many fast. She was really nice too, man. She's really nice, like legit Nice, like not a bullshit. Nice. Just a nice person. Yeah. It's nice when you see someone that's trying to do that, that's trying to do the right thing. Yeah. It was rather bro. Where did you get that from? From Kevin d from watching how she talks. I think so. Well, we're trying to hit you. Don't you don't think Kat von D is Hot? Are you saying something? Like I said, I watched her show look. Yo Man, sounds like to me. Do it again, but look me in the eyes. Red Ban is that are um, impression for everybody. Like what? Spiderman sound like sticky in my head. That's it. It's sucky. Impression do. That's terrible. That was fucking spot on. Really? Yeah. Deeper crashing.

Speaker 1:          00:30:11       No, I'm a big fan of Kat von D. I watched every episode of that show. Really? Absolutely. I see Eddie Bravo episode. Probably missed that one, but the other ones I caught. Why it's me, man. What's it must be the ringtone. Fucking a t and t commercial. You gave me shit about mine too because I have on that. I have the same thing. Why I don't change turn. I just want to know if someone's calling. Okay. That's all I want to know, Brian. I don't really give a fuck what it, Sandy, I love you. Hello Brian. Hey stop him. He's taking your girl. That's not cool. You said Kat von d I love you. That's so not cool. You, you don't understand what it was like for Little Bri yesterday. Really horrible. You want to hear my new ringtone is a cat?

Speaker 4:          00:30:55       Yes. Okay. Stop that.

Speaker 1:          00:31:01       He's terrible man. You really need to find out what happened to you that froze you in 12 did you spend some time with schizophrenia? Like yesterday? There was some strange moment when you were 12 and you just stuck their emotional life in that ring tone. How do you even know if it's your phone? If it's ringing? I don't give a fuck. Just check. How about that? How about I don't give a fuck, right? You should sell ringtones man, cause I was going through the ringtones store and that the top 10 ones are so dumb. Like snakes. Unicorn was the best one and I was just really stone. But there's like one that's just like a black eye going yo man into your phone. That's what I want. I want a white guy doing a bad black guy to, if you were in like a really black area and you hear the phone go right,

Speaker 4:          00:31:45       no phone, motherfucker pick up y'all phone bed.

Speaker 1:          00:31:50       You don't think my impression of a blackboard turn right. Just think it was over. It was okay. It was a little racist kids lately. I only said that. I only said that because it was the funniest thing to say. Okay. Um, I don't think you're racist by any stretch of the imagination, but I did. I put on myself, I put what some people thought was a racist tweet the other day. I wrote a, I saw a black, I would admit Romney bumper sticker on his car. I go to the mines were right. This fucking thing is over. Yeah. Like that. That's ridiculous. Is Black and white racist piece of shit. And all of a sudden people were saying on a racist piece of shit. How is that racist? Uh, I don't know. I don't know enough about Mitt Romney to know if there was a joke in there about him in black people or what.

Speaker 1:          00:32:37       My question is what black guys are relating to Mitt Romney or here? I mean that's going to get you some more tweets. I need to look. I wish there was another alternative because I'm not really happy with either one of these guys. This is, it seems silly to me. I mean, uh, I feel like socially Obama's way better, the way he communicates his battery, he's way smarter. He's way more moderate, more way more reasonable. They're hanging out with way more impressive fuck Yad. Where the Obama [inaudible] out is that seems like fuck, look at all the shit that got passed while Obama was in office. I don't know how much of that had to do with them. It's so hard to believe that a young guy just a few years older than me would be so willing to give in to this ridiculous idea that given the government more power over the people is necessary to keep us safe.

Speaker 1:          00:33:29       Cause I think that's just total horse shit. I just think they want to lock it down and they're slowly eroding our rights and they're doing it in a very unconstitutional way. And that's not the way to do your job. Your job is to do it within a constitutional way. And if you, you, if you can't keep us safe in a constitutional way, it means you suck at your fucking job. You need to get better at that. But we don't need to do is look at everybody's fucking email and listen to everybody's voicemail messages and track everybody's movement through GPS. And you don't need to do all that. This is crazy because who decides who has access to that information? Who Decides? You know, he, the people could harass you because you have different political beliefs than them or you, the, your, you know, interrupting their campaign that, you know, this, there's a lot of different things that someone could do if they have influence, if they have enough power over you by, uh, by being able to, to, to track your whereabouts and listening to their all, all your phone calls.

Speaker 1:          00:34:24       That shit is ridiculous. And the fact that that's happening in America, man, that's what we always used to make fun of the Soviet Union about that, you know, everything. Everybody was being a spy. And spied on. And we never thought that shit was going on over here. And then meanwhile the government just opens up the floodgates and it's all of us and now it's so gross. And that didn't you retweet that somebody, I didn't even know about this. And it amazes me that the, that this happens and nobody knows that they, they audited the Fed and that they find out that like the bailout, um, amounts, we're not even close. It was trillions of dollars in secret Bayley's bail outs. And then certain companies were getting trillions, not brilliant. Not even like what we were told they were getting like with say, 50 billion, you're like, Jesus, you've got 50 billion now.

Speaker 1:          00:35:14       They got like one point $3 trillion. Yeah, it's insane. And that was like, uh, the, like it was in the news, but like I feel like nobody really, they were like, oh yeah, so what happened? I don't get it, man. I don't, I don't understand how any of it flies. It's the, I mean, the whole idea that you get that, first of all, the whole idea that the only way to fix all this shit has to take more money from office fucking preserve. That is so bonkers. That's the stupidest idea ever. It's like you're telling me that you just have to, no matter what, keep these defense budgets the way they are now. That's what they're saying essentially is saying, look, look, we're not going to shrink that. So let's just concentrate on who it along. Why can some things off and some other, it's this giant chunk.

Speaker 1:          00:35:53       Our money's being thrown at this ridiculous situation, this horrific situation rather. And now I can't fix that. That is just what it is. You know? We'll cut that a little bit. We're going to cut that a little bit. We got no money for pizza in school though. You know, it's, it's, uh, the idea that, you know, when you're gonna need a little bit more from everybody, like, no, you don't. You need to stop spending money on shit that we don't want you to spend money on. What the fuck? Where's the money going? And nobody. The thing is like not only defense, but nobody is ever really willing to make confessions. Nobody wants to give up whatever their cause is or whatever their committee, they sit on, just go somewhere else. So you end up finding a group of people that are all agreeing to not make any, any deals like no, just take from somebody else, just not us.

Speaker 1:          00:36:39       And it goes around the circle and then you'd go like, all right, that was fun. Fucking nobody made any concessions at all. First of all, the only way we're gonna fix this whole world problem as we're going to have to be able to read each other's minds. People are just too full of shit. Language is just one step on an ever ending or never ending rather process of, of getting closer and closer to each other languages, uh, the ability to do it and expression and you say what you s you comes out of your mouth. I know what you're saying. I know who you are. You talk, I know who you are. We're going to be able to get past that. That's what the next step is. The next step is we're going to be able to read each other's minds and until then we're going to have a really hard time with this fucking thing because people were full of shit and people misinterpret people's words and people are touchy and people don't know why they're really mad and you know there's a lot of the problems with what normal human communication and part of it is, I can only gauge your intent like guesswork.

Speaker 1:          00:37:35       I can only gauge your intent by how you, how you respond, guesswork and, and, and then you put it into the computer that is your brain and try to figure out if this person is good for my life as personally bad for my life, is this person, my friend, and they're looking out for me. Eventually we're going to just read each other's minds. That's all going to be bullshit. And you're going to know who's a consequent consequently know the cons to going to have to straighten up. It's going to be like a beautiful moment. Yeah. But you're also gonna know, you know, all the creepy shit about people we're getting, we're going to definitely get past the idea that the only way I can communicate is through some noise, some mouth noise and some text messages looking at somebody you think, well, look at the interface of text messaging.

Speaker 1:          00:38:17       I mean, look at how that's already got your, you've already got this new way to communicate with people that are nowhere near you. Yeah. You know, so you're, you're getting a little bit of their information, a little bit of their personality, a little bit of their mind, this little text that's coming in on your phone. Yeah. Well eventually that's gonna it's gonna Morph into the next thing. Whatever the fuck it is. It's going to be people that let you ride along where you could tap into their consciousness and you could walk around with them and shit. Yeah. I don't, I don't see that being outside of the realm of possibility. I think that's totally possible that you could eventually get to a point where a person interfaces with some sort of an internet connection in, um, it may be some, some sort of, something that you would wear on your head that stimulates various parts of the brain with electrical impulses or something that can trigger certain experiences.

Speaker 1:          00:39:07       If they figured out how to really wire that, maybe they'll actually have to fucking drill some holes in your head and Shit and put little little conductors that you have to screw shit into. But people would totally do it if you could actually work that out. Probably ride along with each other. Yeah. Look, you could go, uh, you were a real fence if you're a real freak, you know, like those dudes like watching their wives, fuck fuck other guys, they get like be their wife while she gets fucked by this giant black guy. Yeah, he's gotta be bad. Cause that's the scariest big guys one. But big black eyes. The scariest or that's maybe like what is thing? It was not like cuckold, is that what they call them guys and like watching other guys to fuck their wives in front of them. That's, that's interesting.

Speaker 1:          00:39:49       That's to me, that's the real quick and that's the exciting point for them. They're like, this guy's about to drill my wife, this is fucking awesome. That's so crazy. Yeah. Yep. And they want, they want her to get fucking hammered. But how can that end in anything other than murder, suicide, Kenneth? I don't know. But I was just thinking you could never switch it. You can never fuck a girl in front of your wife. And she's just sitting there brushing her hair. Really. You know, slow. And I don't think so unless she was crazy. But it's, but it's not normal that a guy would sit there and get off on that. No, it's not normal at all. Some guys are just real freaks. Yeah. But there's everything, you know, I mean, shit, that's well put. There's everything. That really is what the answer is. And we didn't really know that as much when we were kids.

Speaker 1:          00:40:36       That's why you were subject to get a costed by like, uh, some predator. Yeah, because you never knew any predators. So we didn't, we didn't have access to nearly as much information. The Internet really exposes fuck yeah. Every kid knows about pedos now we got a pedo bear, you know, I mean pedos weren't something that everybody talked about when I was a kid was it was like you keep away from that man, he's a bad man. And He'd be like, Oh, who's the bad guy? Bad Guy over there. Why is he back by the partner wise that nobody understood what, how kids know now you have the files, how many kinks there are. Like there's all these, you go on line sub categories of shit and you're like, that's a thing. Really? Yeah. Oh my God, there's exposed and instead we're like adults now. But you realize that like if you look back on like fifth grade, you, he's aware that 10 year olds are online. All these, oh there's this shit. There was always specialty things. There was always like, like, but it was hard to find them. Like if you were going to be in a weird freak shit. Yeah. Like some dudes are in the feet. Yeah. And they were, they were actual feet magazines. Yeah. Nice. We, I found a feet Porno magazine with my friends. I have it in the woods. Oh, okay.

Speaker 1:          00:41:49       We were wandering through the woods and we found a pile of magazines, like in a plastic bag. If you found them in the woods, there were almost 60% of the time they were porn. Right. Right. If you found a dude who went to read magazines in the woods, it was a lot of people that would go and they would just go beat off in the woods, man. Great. I love that. And dudes that go to read magazines and they left their stash back there so we will go find their stash. And so it was me and my two friends and uh, as, uh, they were opening the, the pages, my front, there were two, one dues from Argentina. They'll do was from Cuba. Yeah. And we're, we're in Florida and we're peeling back these pages and this kid stops and he goes, man, I think this shit is just dicks and feet.

Speaker 5:          00:42:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:42:37       Ah, that's the quote of the day ladies. And, and it was one of the first times I had ever saw anybody like so clearly say what the fuck when they don't really want an answer. Right. You know that, you know when you say like, what the fuck? Yeah. And you don't really, yeah. It was just like, what the fuck? Like he knew, I didn't know. I knew he didn't know we were 11 or we're looking at like dude's jerking off on, yeah, I guess a whole thing. I've been wanting that to be a thing. I didn't know it was, I found the creepiest new fetish I'll yesterday, it's called belly punching. Just guys and girls punching a other girls in the belly really hard. Really? And they get off on it. I don't want to watch that. And the videos are just really disturbing. I, it's from Brazil.

Speaker 1:          00:43:27       You don't get that off. Please shut that off. That stuff bugs me. I don't get off on it, but I've seen it and it was like, it was so extreme that I was like in tears laughing. What was it? The ball kicking. Oh Jeez. But so I saw one, I was like, oh, that's clearly that guy has a cup on, you know, like you can tell this one was genuine. She was like, she was kicking like 50 yard field. It's like lining up and taking off. And he was like, ah, his legs were shaking and then she's like, yes, suffer, suffer and like fucking dude. Fuck. Is that about, I don't know man. But somebody like somebody who's not watching that like to lap, they're watching that. That is the most erotic arousing thing. I got kicked once so hard in a tournament. I've been kicked many times when I get kicked once in a tournament where my cops slammed into my balls and it, it Wa I was fucked up.

Speaker 1:          00:44:18       My, my ball swole up, they were purple and they swole up like it's swollen up like twice the size of normal. What I don't understand, I don't understand how the guy can physically take it. Which I didn't do. I have what? Do have any photos? I would have taken a photo of the batch of it. I was only like 16 or 17 they physically tell like cause like that obviously a fee where you like ha like oh it was fucked up man. I been kicking the balls and it's like I can't even, I wouldn't be able to like if there was a second kick I would just shit myself. I got a boner on the way home though, so I was happy. I was happy that it still worked. It was almost like my body was letting me know my way because that was when I was like, when I was like 16 or 17 I want to get those random boners I could be walking and it was just kid a complete hard on like out of nowhere. What the fuck is this doing here? It's cool too. You didn't know. It's like given a blind person that gun. Like what is, what is this a trigger?

Speaker 1:          00:45:10       I don't know what you're doing and when you're, when you're a 17 year old kid just walking around with a boner. I would crank out so many fucking always horny and like that that chamber is fucking reloaded immediate immediately. And what's really fucked up is that that is probably like one of the biggest shifts as a human being that your life makes from no sex at all. To boom. Having a girlfriend when you were in your teenage years, which are confusing. It's fuck yeah. I mean your teenage years are on mass and in that you were having relationships. You're making it out with people and young penises going into girl's vagina. It's the best you've ever felt in your life. And she's on the pill so you can squirt it in her, I guess. So confused. He gets so baffled. You're so fucking twisted. Just so absorbed in that person.

Speaker 1:          00:46:04       And that's why you see so many people that age, like throw everything else away for that relationship because they can't. It's all so addict behavior. Yeah. We've all been guilty of it. Sure. Addict behaviors. Not just physical addiction. It's just like squirly thinking, you know, no addict behavior. It's like some, there's a lot of like different activities that shouldn't really exist for our shitty minds, but they do exist and people can't help because of the fact that they have access to casinos. There's certain people that cannot fucking hell bet they're drawn in there and gamble. They want to, that's what they live for. It's it's, I've seen it. It's craziness. And they'll go on these programs now. I'm not gambling anymore. I'm not doing this anymore. I'm done. Then next thing you know, and I'm just going to try it a little, I could handle it now.

Speaker 1:          00:46:56       It's all about management. Boom, back in the slide. Crazy in debt. Never get, and it's not, it's just no, just no drugs. There's no dealer, there's no no poisoning. There's just fucking do this weird idea that you need to fucking pull that lever and see those lemons. You so glad I don't have that. Oh, and then they take that money and go right back in. Was fucking horrified. It was a guy named White Plains Charlie when I was a kid and I used to play pool at executive billiards. He was the first guy that ever met was an absolute 100% gambling junkie. This guy didn't do a goddamn thing for a, and he lived off of handouts and games who hustled pool. He slept in like homeless shelters and the, you know, in different people's houses and you know, had apartments in like real, real squirrely situations and he would just come down the pool hall and go to the race track and that's all this guy did.

Speaker 1:          00:47:52       That's all this guy did. He was always in action. He was always an action component and it was so sad guy cause he was in his like seventies you know. And he was like, you know, just a really tiny, tiny man and people would yell at 'em and they'd fucking treat him like shit cause he was always broke and he would yell at them and he would always loses money. Those guys almost had those motherfuckers. I'm supposed to have seven, seven a fight and you know, we'd have some number of problem that went wrong on. Of course, I know that would have paid two thousand two thousand can you believe that? Shit. I can't tell you how many conversations I had with White Plains Charlie. Well, he would come in there and go, Joe, you ain't going to believe this. That got me out the track again. I'm down and I was, I was like at the time, maybe 22 to 23 years old, so the whole thing to me was just completely baffling.

Speaker 1:          00:48:42       I was like, wow, this guy's out of his fucking head for sure. This is crazy. He just can't stop gambling. I've never seen anything like it. I know it could. Poker guy like that who just can't stop. They can't stop and sweaty hands. I, I was completely addicted to play in that quake game a hundred percent 100% I loved it. Loved it, loved it. Dubbed the hours and hours a day. If you were talking and I'm listening to you talk and you're boring the shit out of me and be like, why am I spending time doing this when I can be playing quake and my time would be awesome as always, really I would not want to talk to people. I would want it to sit in front of the computer with the headphones on because you could hear like who's walking on the right hand side. Really like footsteps on the right or footsteps on the left.

Speaker 1:          00:49:25       You have to, you have to creep because if you walk you don't make any noise. But if you want to jump, if you want to strafe jump. If you want to run, you make noise. Yeah, and I would get addicted dude. Wander down hallways, rocket launcher and people in the heads. It's fun. It's fun. I've been lost in video games before to addict behavior. The real problem is it doesn't make you ultimately feel like you got anything done. Like if I put the same amount of effort into making podcasts or the same amount of effort into like doing stand up, I feel like I got something done, you know? But if you're just out there fucking throwing squares with numbers around, what are you doing? What are you doing? You playing cards? What are you doing? Just nothing actually happening. He playing quake. I fucked him.

Speaker 1:          00:50:10       Killed everybody that nothing really happened. No. Okay. You just got, you just got jolted, nothing was really created an eight hours. You basically gave all your time, you know, to this uh, this artificial experience and you know you've got an adrenaline rush out of it. It was a lot of fun. It was great but, but ultimately nothing was created. Whereas like if you took that same amount of time and you decided to, I'm going to draw a picture, I'm going to paint something, I'm going to write a song like an actual physical thing manifests itself that people can enjoy or fucking rocket launches. Lightening Bolt guns and shit gunning people down. Hey low. You don't get anything out of that. It's weird that your game halo you used to be. I tried to, I step away. I literally forced myself not to get on game systems that much anymore cause I would, I would do that and I would do a Madden and NCAA most to be awesome.

Speaker 1:          00:51:05       The mad cause I liked college ball a lot. I would play, you could create a player, you start your team and then play a season. Did you make white guys? When I would make, I would make fucking Tom run at 43 44 it would give them ridiculous power. Absolutely. I'd be like Vikings three two 30 just fucking yoked. Yeah, absolutely. Just Vikings, Vikings, army of Brock Lesnar's the full, I would say I would play, I would do the spring thing, spring ball and then play fucking 12 games season that the conference game and the in the bowl game. And then recruit players for that cause you can recruit and recruit them for the next year and fucking, I'd played, you know, 14 games in a row and I'm like holding on for the next season to start. And this is like in one city. Wow. Yeah. It's, it's hours and hours. It's not good man.

Speaker 1:          00:51:57       Well that's the same thing with poker too, right? I mean, when people start playing poker, don't they disappear? Absolutely. And the guys that, the guy that I know that, that, that does it the most, like not only did you disappear and doing all that behavior, but he's also fucking losing his livelihood. You know, like Shit fucking down 500 today. So art, it's hard to make a living playing poker. You mean you gotta be super good? You mean all props to those Daniel and the Granola type characters that have been noon, Phil Ivey and all these guys that you like to hear about? I don't play it. Um, I don't like cards. It's not that I don't like cards, it's just, it's not something that I'm interested in doing because when I was a a kid and I would play pool, the card games would always interrupt the pool action.

Speaker 1:          00:52:38       Oh really? And everybody would like Jesus Christ. Is this a card place or a pool hall? Like guys that what you would normally get bets with? They wanted to go gamble because that's all pool halls were about. All pool halls were about what? It's like hobby people who were into a, just knocking balls around with their friends who never got good. And then either tournament players are gamblers. And so the tournament players are usually both porn meant players and gamblers. So there's always gambling unless of asshole came around with a deck of cards because you can't, you don't, you can miss when you're playing pool, you know, you can mess, you can hit play on a Gaffey table where the pockets are weird and this guy might know the table about it than you do. So he knows what spots to avoid. But with poker you can't eat, does no missing.

Speaker 1:          00:53:21       You just, you're really gambling, you're just gambling. You know, you're, you're using your intelligence but also gambling. I don't get poked in the, I'm of the mind for it, man. I'm really powerful. CTO, coconut water. Thank you very much. I'm not into it man. Let me see. Emanated by numbers and I'm intimidated by, um, just like the game itself never been, was like an awesome game. It seems like a, a real absorbing game though. It seems like a very, like you have to really be a, a bad motherfucker to understand the in and outs of poker and to have like, you know, years and years of intuition. I mean those are special dudes. They, they obviously have special mines. Just for me, my, my, I was always so absorbed with things that required execution, physical execution as well as like mental. And that's why I liked quake cause it was like this hand eye coordination thing.

Speaker 1:          00:54:07       That was what I was getting my rocks off on. And that's the same thing with pool. So to me it's like it was always a physical thing as well as a mental thing. I felt like the real, the real thrills to me, well when I can combine the two things together, when I could combine a physical experience and a mental experience. That's why I liked Jujitsu. That's why I like playing pool. So the card thing was lacking. The physical part, there's no execution. I didn't have to execute. So that was, it was like way less exciting. I was like, you can't compare the difference between when you're watching a guy gambling and his gambling for $10,000 a set of nine ball and every fucking pocket he's putting his hands on his shirt and blow it on his hands and put talcum powder on and he's sweating and he's trying to keep it together.

Speaker 1:          00:54:52       You're trying to like really gently control how ball spins and collides with another ball and you know, make sure that you hit it just enough so that lands perfectly for the next one all while you're gambling, you know? I mean that's what, what's exciting when you're just sitting there with cards and you, you know what card to pick stupid. Just pick the fucking card. It's like you win or you don't when it's like it's not the same loss you guys shoots your nuts in and the game of pool, I'll give you a plan. 10 year plan to race to 10 and he breaks. It runs out 10 games on you, you lose. You don't even get a chance to play like that can't happen. That has happened. It really not to me, but it has happened in the past 10 in a row. Just run.

Speaker 1:          00:55:31       The things happen more than once. There was a one guy who did it for $1 million. Cool. Yeah. They had an insurance policy to a c who could a run. If you could run 10 racks in a row, which has never been done in the competition before, you could win $1 million. They'd only been done like a couple of times. Like Johnny Archer ran 10 and out on Francisco Bustamonte there were gambling. And that was like a legendary story because Francisco Bustamante doubled the bet after Johnny Archer ran 10 and out on him. And he was like, this guy can't keep this shit up. Doubled the bat. And then in the next game, which is really nuts. And then the other one was this Earl Strickland guy who, uh, they had this 10 rack thing where they were insured for 1 million bucks, but the insurance company didn't want to pay because they couldn't believe it.

Speaker 1:          00:56:15       It had been done. They couldn't believe like they, they found the statistics. No one had ever broken, run out 10 racks ever in any, you know, modern nine, that ball tournament that they could have on record. So they said, listen, I don't think it's much of a gamble bet $1 million. If someone does it, they win $1 million or else trickling did it the first fucking tournament they had. I think it was the first, it was either first this second he broken ran 10 racks, like a demon fired in combinations on the nine ball. I mean it was ridiculous shit. It was like movie shit. I am, they denied him. I think he wound up settling but he never got like the full million. I'm really, I think he only got like a quarter million bucks or something like that. I hope I'm wrong, but he's like one of the greatest players of all time and uh, and you know, and he gambles too.

Speaker 1:          00:57:02       He does like those action challenges. There's a action report matches where they uh, they have um, uh, online del La have like just two guys playing for like 25,000 bucks. I'm like put up the money and then they'll, they'll have like a gambling contest. You ever played a, what's the other one called? Sneaker? Sneaker? No, I've never played that same principle but smaller. Well, um, it requires uh, some incredible fundamentals. You, there's more room for error in a game pool then there is and snuck her first of all because the nine ball, like the chosen gambling game, nine balls, the balls are all wild. So what that means is if you miss the one ball in the corner pocket but it spins around and lands on the side, it's still counts. You just, you keep going. When snuck her, I don't think that would ever count.

Speaker 1:          00:57:47       I think sneakers like very precise, you know, I think, you know, and you have to move balls. I don't really totally completely understand it and the tables fucking huge and the balls are tiny and the pockets are tiny as shit and there's certain ways we shoot it. It doesn't accept the ball the same way. It doesn't pull a table. Like I don't think you can cut a ball down the rail the way you can on a, on a, on a regular pool table. So it's, it's, it's a little bit of a different sort of a game. But snooker players notoriously are good at pool. They, uh, like some like the top world snuck players like these English guys and killed Steve Davis. Yeah. They, these uh, these guys are awesome snugger players like world, you know, world champions and they come over and a pool and then eventually they start Rodney O'sullivan and eventually I start fucking up the Americans.

Speaker 1:          00:58:31       Really? It takes time. Yeah. Well the Americans, there's um, this is like a few high level guys, but um, the European guys have such a strong team. Man. It's like there's so many guys like the, the Americans might have like the best guys of all time. Like Johnny Archer, one of the best guys of all time, Earl's trickling when the best guys of all time. Shane van Boning one of the best guys of all time and one of the best guys right now. But Europe is like, there's so many fucking players that are killers. Rear Sump, many pool is huge over there. Man. It's weird how many good guys in Asia, they say an Asia, like there's parts of Asia. We're pool is fucking enormous. The Philippines especially, it's enormous. Like you'd go there. It's like one of their most, they're like number one, um, behind soccer I think.

Speaker 1:          00:59:15       I think at soccer they're the Philippines in the soccer. Does that make sense? Or is it baseball? What am I, am I knickers? Maybe. I know we're just making shit up. Bace no. Well, I mean, I slip and slide. I'm amazed by how sports like culturally like evolve. Well also how certain places like so love a sport and do not give up fuck about another sport. Like cricket would be a great example of like, it's big and some of the islands, it's huge in India. Pakistan, um, Australia, I mean, that shit is like, is it a gambling game? Is that why it's big? I don't know if it's a gambling game, but like you watch it and I'm like, I don't what the fuck's going on? And clearly nobody in this country who's not from one of those countries, like nobody gets, I don't know the rules.

Speaker 1:          01:00:01       It's, I think it's difficult to follow. Like you see the number, you're like, what? And it's like a five day game, you know, you don't understand why they're selling pass. I never do cocaine. I just, I can't get into it. But you know, same thing. Billiards, soccer, football, like those are very regional specific. Well I think you get into a game and then once you get into it, you understand the skill behind it and then that's what you, you know, look, it's so weird. And people were willing to fall into things so odd. Just look at the way baseball uniforms look like. What the fuck are you dressing? Like why do you have to translate that for this stupid game? You're dressing like you live in a different century. What kind of stupid button up shirt or you Wang, what the fuck is with your socks?

Speaker 1:          01:00:46       What the fuck is with your tight pants? If you were just a regular dude walking around with those pants and then street, I'd say get the fuck away from my kids. Yeah, but because you're playing some silly game, you have to dress like a, a pilgrim. This is ridiculous. This game's retarded beyond belief. I know it needs to be revamped. It's like one step away from a pirates fucking out. It's ridiculous and it's a ridiculous game. It's just fucking boring as shit. It takes too long. I can't do it. I've never had to do it. I liked it. I like playing it when I was a kid and when you like playing it, you understand what the skills involved and you know, hitting a 94 mile an hour fast ball or fucking really skilled but catching a ball that's like over the fucking top of the wall.

Speaker 1:          01:01:25       But who cares? Yeah, I don't, I don't like baseball. I like football by far. My favorites like woman's softball. Sports are awesome. I'll tell you what, man, anything that's hard is awesome. Anything where you get into it and you try to express yourself and, and you know and show your, your ability to concentrate and focus through a ball or through whatever the fuck it is that you're doing in any sport. I love watching it. I love watching competition. I love watching. I love watching people, but pay off like a hard work paying off. That's like, to me, I want to see that shit all the time. Even tennis, I don't give a fuck about tennis, but I watched some tennis the other day. I just watched it. I was like, whoa. That guy's really trying to hit that ball. And he's really trying to get, oh, he's real close and pressed.

Speaker 1:          01:02:08       I don't really give a fuck what's going on because it's not my thing. But if I was a tennis head instead of a pool head, it's the same thing. It is. It's easily gotten hooked on tennis or baseball or golf. This is a fucking era. A golden era for tennis too. Isn't bad motherfuckers playing really? Fuck. Yeah. I mean, who's that guy? The guy that beat Serena and um, the other one was, what are the other, the other William's name? Viness. Yeah. Being a sensory and he beat them both. Really? Yeah, man. After he played, he played golf, drank beer, and then, uh, played, uh, one, one seven to one, or whatever. The fuck this really, yeah. Beat them both. Yeah. I don't know. I'll do that. I'll do it. I'll pull it up. It's a famous case. Federer is, you know, like, just amazed.

Speaker 1:          01:02:56       Like he'd be looking at his, he's like one of the all time best right now, right by far. Yeah. He's, um, he's like, they could put him up there with Mcenroe and as proud of those guys, he devastated and crabs dominates people. That's amazing. And he's been doing it consistently now for just years. Men and the dog is also up there. And uh, what's his name? Just retired, uh, Roddick and everybody was like, if his peer class wasn't so good, he would be, he would have won so many more titles, but he's just happens to be around, uh, uh, in this era of like so many, just absolutely dominant tennis players. Yeah. I don't follow it enough, but I would assume that that's just the case with everything right now. Right. I mean, like some of, in the case of basketball towns, like here's an example of one where it's not like the heavyweight boxing division.

Speaker 1:          01:03:48       So people say this is just the, an era where it's not as, as competitive and as big. There's not as many big exciting fighters. So, you know, we don't talk about right now as being the most exciting time. And I mean, you know, boxing in general has taken a dip, but like people have always been drawn to the heavyweight division in boxing. You know, it's the most, it's the one that, that people always like big, you know, so the heavyweight boxers right now, you know, I guess you could, the Klitschkos, the Klitschkos can pretty much own it. I mean, part of that you could argue that hey, they're not American. So Americans get excited about American heavyweights basically. And those guys have been dominant. They're not American, but you know, the division pretty much has a lot of journeymen and they go up and they give it a shot.

Speaker 1:          01:04:36       And sometimes the belt switches hands, but it's pretty much the Klitschkos to, to run through. And people don't talk about this. I was like, wow, this era right now, you know, heavyweight boxers, not a great area. It's not a great area. I know it's not a like a Holyfield or Lennox Lewis and there's, and there's, and then like another guy would pop up. But you know, beau would pop in and you'd be like, Oh shit, who's this guy? And it's weird, the two white guys are running shit. Ronnie White Russian dudes who are doctors this, uh, running shit. They tell you, I went to this, I went to this boxing gym in, uh, uh, in Glendale and it was a guy there who was like trained a bunch of them and he said basically like those guys they train like, all right, a thousand right? Crosses like, yeah, they're willing to do some shit.

Speaker 1:          01:05:20       Then like if someone comes in not knowing that to start that shit over. And so like technically every punch is always exactly like executed, like never off. You'd watch them. It's just like, it's perfect execution, but it's not exciting before anybody has a chance to get good. They nip them, go get them quick before he gets sit as a guy becomes he remotely and the contention and the guy, the trainer guy was like, he's, he's foreign. So he has this heavy accent. And he's like telling me about like, different, he's like, no. Have you ever fight with a Mexican? You know, they're like dogs. They just go into a fight, fight, fight, fight. I'm like, okay. I was like, do you tell everybody that? He's like, fuck dude, it's such that foreign mindset. This is no, this is just how it is. Just racism was, and just like, he's like, Dad, he's like, you gotta take a Mexican doubt cause they'll never stop fighting.

Speaker 1:          01:06:09       And I'm like crying. And then he was like, the blacks, oh please, just great. You know, like, like fighting black house. No, he was like, they're just the, you know, like, he's like a, he was talking about Floyd and he was just like, you know, um, technically, um, just had fantastic puncher like Floyd Mayweather, just everything perfect. Perfect. But on top of that has out of control, reflexes skills and providing skills. And he fence trained perfectly. I mean, his brother Roger, you know, Roger, Roger May, whether it was a fantastic boxer, his dad was a good box. Talk about Victoria teas. That was the best sound bite ever from 24, seven. That thing was so ridiculous, that fight, that fight was so ridiculous. He sucker punch that dude. Guys look at the referee and he's like, bitch, we still fight and correct. Blam weird of Ortiz though, too silly.

Speaker 1:          01:07:08       So, and then he kind of gave it up, but then like we talked about, um, what's his name? Uh, I liked the way Victoria t's fights on, man, that guy's crazy. Yeah, he's a tough guy. Just messed up. He just made an error. What's the Filipino? I can't even think right now. Uh, you know, so who's the many backyard pack? Yeah. Um, I would like, you call it the Filipino, uh, one of the greatest boxers in the history. Maybe the greatest accomplishment, but he, you know, like he leaves the ground like, Oh yes. Rose's legs and his punches. Fucking powerful. Ooh, he hits so hard. A lot of his power comes from his legs. He's a powerful dude. Manny packer. I was a fucking murderous puncher. He, he, when he fought, um, what the fuck's his name? Um, the two d broke both his eye sockets.

Speaker 1:          01:07:55       It Margarito. Yeah. Antonio, the guy who was disgraced for use plaster and his knuckles. Yeah. Yeah. Boy, he paid that price. Karmic Karmically, he paid that price man cause Paki I'll beat his fucking eyes and he beat his eye so bad they had to replace the Lens in his eye with an artificial lens. Oh my God. Yeah. Have fight again. Yup, man. Fuck yeah, he did. Yeah, he got back in there. Jesus Christ. We got back in there and fought Miguel Cotto and Miguel Cotto was one of the guys who he beat or they suspected they did something to his gloves because he's fucked a dude up. Like murderously fucked him up and he never really did that with anybody. Like he was just knocking motherfuckers out cold. Cadeau no. Now Margarita before they found the plaster in his gloves because he did it to Cota though, right? Yeah, he did.

Speaker 1:          01:08:42       He did the first time, but the second time Codo stopped him. But it was a, I think it was like a cut or some shit that stopped him, but Margarito uh, couldn't, couldn't really hit as hard after they caught him with the plaster. That was scary shit to think that a guy was like making his career. He put rocks in his gloves put up. I mean dickhead. Yeah, he's not, he's totally cheating. Yeah. And getting away with it and giving you like definitely fucking more aggravated brain damage than you would be getting. You know what I mean? He's hitting you with fucking casts and your faith. Yeah. Like that's really shaking up the inside of your head. There was a fight during the, I think it was the 80s where a guy had pulled, Panama, Lewis had pulled the stuffing out of a guy's and I remember that.

Speaker 1:          01:09:31       And it was this kid, I believe the kid's name was Louie Resto, the boxer. And then the other one was Billy Collins. I think it was, I forget, I forget what the guy's name was, but the poor kid had like ended his career and the the, cause he just got bare knuckle the dice. Yeah. Well he crashed into a tree. They think he committed suicide. And the guy, Panama Red was, uh, Panama Lewis Lewis was, uh, was, was suspended like years. The fighter, I don't think he ever fought again. And he denied any wrongdoing until a few years ago. And he, he gave it up on camera. Really? Yeah. Yeah. The boxer, which fight about the fight that you're talking about. What they found that right away though. But the box, the guy that was guilty of like the guy who, who Panama was training. Yeah. I believe it was Louie Resto. He, he denied it and was like, I didn't, he didn't know that.

Speaker 1:          01:10:27       He didn't know exactly like it was an accident. And so that's silly and you would fail the first punch you through. His family always had his back. Like they were like, you know, it wasn't, it wasn't on him. And then on camera with his family there, he was like, no, I know what I did. Oh, they're just devastated. Yeah. That's a terrible, terrible, terrible thing to live with, man. That's not just cheating. That's like, ugh. That's horrific man. You basically, you know, you ruined the guys life. Yeah, you did. It ruined the guys life. A guy who was really good at competing under a set of rules and you just fucking totally hijacked the whole thing on TV. You stupid fuck on TV. Beat a guy up with no, no padding and your gloves. So you just bare knuckle cranes and you cheated. You cheat and asshole. Isn't it crazy that you still get all these guys every single year in every sport that

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       all still cheat. And you know the

Speaker 1:          01:11:17       big slate, they took some, I forget some, somebody metal was, you know, one guy had marijuana in his system. Oh really? Yeah. The motherfucker had weighed in the system. Yeah. Some ski or some Shit. Ah, that's not, well, let's get your eye. Can See someone who got kicked off the team for weed was a judo. There was a judo guy, was a judo guy, got kicked off [inaudible] shit. You're like, how are you still like, you know, they're gonna come after you, man. There's a lot of different shit that people are doing that they've got away with in the past, I think. And they're slowly starting to clamp down on that thing and fucking Armstrong. Well, this isn't, well, the crazy thing about Armstrong is he's only done by this one. Like it's an American thing that's gone after night. It states anti-doping and it was fucking, but that has nothing to do with the Tour de France.

Speaker 1:          01:12:07       So when they say that he doesn't have the, uh, the eight toward the France, notice how I say France? Yes. Sophisticated. I've been to the airport in Patti Sharp Balto what they're saying that jurisdiction they do. I thought so because I mean, everything that I saw was, he was stripped of his title is I heard that he was stripped by these people, that they don't recognize it, but I don't know if he's necessarily stripped by the, the, whoever the fuck puts on the Tour de France definitely did what they said he did. You think so look up guns.

Speaker 3:          01:12:42       Hundred percent. I do not believe in these witch hunts for, for like people that are essentially, uh, like heroes and super like nobody accuses, um, you know, Michael Jordan of having done this. Nobody. A clique accuses, um, you know, Joe Montana of having done this. They do it because it's there. His teammates have all come, come clean about it. They've also, we all did this shit, everybody. And then when you finally have your chance, you finally have your chance to be like, this is the last. He's like, you know what? Enough's enough. Really, enough's enough. That's the, I'm just tired of fighting this fight. Well, you have a chance now. This is your fine. This is the, like the final lap of the, of the race. This is when you go, I'm just, you know what man? At some point,

Speaker 1:          01:13:31       well he's been in his defense, he's been defending it for years. But you give up and let them take your name. And while you're doing, know that he has passed, and I'm just playing devil's advocate here, but do you know that he's past like 500 drugs? Yes, I do. I do. But why? Why is there a witch hunt to get somebody like that? I don't, I don't, I don't lose, this is what, what gets me, you ever see a dude is like killed his wife and he's on the, he's on the news and they're a accusing him of, uh, of, you know, like, why'd you do it? Why'd you do it? And it was like I didn't, didn't do anything. And you're like, that is not how you would react if your wife was killed and they were dragging you off and you were innocent.

Speaker 1:          01:14:07       You would be freaking the fuck out. Like what? You lost your loved one. You're a crazy person. You're a crazy person that they caught doing something. Yeah. Um, so, but like you think that they would go after him though if he, if there wasn't any evidence to support that. I don't know. Like, like how, no, I'm saying like, do you like for Lance, right? I mean I don't know what they can do. I mean I think once he's passed the drug test, he passed like 500 fucking drug test. But here's the thing, where's the evidence? What do you have? Do you have any of his blood and you can run it through a machine and find some shit that we didn't find before. Is that if you don't have that then what are you doing? I think they do have a, have they do have that.

Speaker 1:          01:14:49       That would be no, they would have said they had that. If they do have that, they would have put that shit on the news. They would tell you what it is. It's not something that you can keep a secret. They have some sample, cause some sample was referenced with some sample reference because he tested positive for EPO. Was it that, I feel like you got tested positive or something, but whatever the fuck it is, you would, you should have either got him back then or you need to let it go and realize that now with your new super sophisticated methods of, of testing, he might not pass those tests before. But guess what he did let's fucking move on. Yeah. Well, you know, leave the guy alone. I mean, you're going to ruin his life because he did exactly what everybody else did. He just was better at it.

Speaker 1:          01:15:29       Cause that's what happened. So, but around you gotta be, you have to assume that he's a real motherfucker. But here's my question. Why did they, why does he have to tell anybody that he was, if they were all doping? Okay. And that's what we're assuming that's the case. We're assuming that everyone at the top of the list, and by the way, a lot of the doping does not necessarily even have to be unhealthy. Like the blood transfusions. That's not unhealthy. Blood doping is not unhealthy. It just is an unknown, an inordinate amount of blood in your body. You have a much more easy way of producing oxygen. You A, you can process oxygen better. That's why being dehydrated it's so bad for your cardio. It's like one of the most important things for, you know, outdoor exercise. Well that was, um, I think, uh, that was a fuck. How would it, how would they describe it?

Speaker 1:          01:16:20       It's, um, I, I just don't think any of them can achieve the highest level without doing at least some of that. If it's not blood doping, if it's not taken EPO, if it's not taking, you know, some fucking routes that boost your testosterone that are illegal today but won't be legal in six months from now. When they find out about it, there's a, it seems like if everybody is doing it at the very top of the list, if the all those guys on his team got busted, I can only make sense that he could do it too. I just think that for me, the assumption that I make, and I again I realized that I'm not privy to any of the like evidence or information, but the assumption that I make is if all these guys say he did it, that he worked with all his former teammates.

Speaker 1:          01:17:05       Do they just associates? Everybody says that and then the, the, the doping organism. Our agency is so adamant about pursuing it. Like what? Why? Why would you do this if there's nothing there, why are you trying to get the like Pete generally that doesn't happen. People don't go after somebody just because, do you think that's because like prosecutors sorta get a wild hair across their ass. They're like, we're going to go get this guy and then it becomes like a competition. They could be it. That's definitely possible. And they get, they get, you know, they, that that obviously happened like in that Duke Lacrosse case where the, the, uh, the prosecutor there was like, he made a fucking show of it. Like we're going to before even like reviewing a what, like the information and the evidence and then he paid a huge price because he was boasting and trashing them before they even got in a courtroom and ended up fucking losing his license to practice.

Speaker 1:          01:17:58       But I think part of that, what he did before was from that charge, he got of like, I'm going to put these, these rich entitled kids, uh, fucking in their place, watch this right now. And then it came back to bite them. So yeah, I think there is partly for some of that people going after the big name, but I just don't see, I don't see them trying to do this to him for no reason. I just don't see, I agree with you, but I don't know what the reasons are if I felt like if the guy passed that many drug tests. Yeah. I mean if and if everybody was doing what he was doing, if that's what they're saying, what's he just, was he just better in spite of the doping was everybody was doping. If he's the best, he's the, he's a super talented actor.

Speaker 1:          01:18:39       Clearly he's unbelievably disciplined. So if you're telling me they all doped. Yeah. Is that, isn't that not a level playing field? It's like the baseball argument. They're saying this is like the asterick whatever era. Yeah, because like at first it was like a few guys and then a few more and then you're like, hold on, did everybody just juice for like this five or 10 year period and it's looking like a huge percentage where it's not even news anymore. Right. When you find out that like all the, all the big, all the big superstars did it, you know, all of them. It's crazy. All the home run records were broken in that era. When you look at Mark McGuire now and we hear him talk about it and you hear him, you know he just like broke down when he was describing what he did. He look at the best is when you see like a, when he was like an Oakland, a bash brothers era and you see him and he's like, you know, he's like six [inaudible] four and he looks like a fucking pencil to that.

Speaker 1:          01:19:30       Did a TV show with him. Did you really? He was an on an episode of Hardball Faculty of These Really Skinny Man. He was young. This is the pre HGH days. He turned into a Gore Raila. He just went crazy with that working out. But, but look at the dividends man. All of a sudden he's just playing over rising balls. But bonds too. When you see [inaudible] Aiko higher. It's uniform and is a giant shit. It's fucking big. Conseco was, yeah, he's a monster suit. I was walking, I was working rather in the Boston athletic club and I was 19 and Conseco was in town and he needed somewhere to work out and they must have been staying close to the Boston athletic clubs. They came down and worked out and that guy walked through the door. I was like, Jesus Christ, like on TV with their silly 1860s outfits on. They don't look that big. But when that guy walked in the, I'm like, he's like 300 pounds. He's fucking huge. I mean he might not have been 300 but he was like, well over two 50 he was enormous.

Speaker 3:          01:20:29       The, I remember the first time when I was like, holy shit at the size of some like fucking humans was, I was in high school and I played in high school football like two hours north of Miami. I went with a friend of mine on like a recruiting trip with his trip down to the University of Miami and we're standing on the field and the players were run out of the tunnel and I'm looking at dudes in their chest, like I'm standing there looking at the numbers and I'm like, holy fuck, I could never play. It's guys like this, like dudes that were like six six, three 30 and I was like, these are fucking animals running around, man.

Speaker 1:          01:21:10       Did people like that exist a hundred years ago? I don't think so. The one of the reasons why I think they might have like every now and then there was a guy that was the, the heavyweight champion. His name was Primo Carnera and it was all like legit giant. He was fucking enormous. But like the best guys me see how big Primo coordinator narrow was. I think he was the biggest heavyweight champion ever. I think up until like at least like modern times. Cause I think there was some fucking giant Russian dude recently that was even bigger than that. But, uh, I think this guy lived in like the, the fifties I believe it was. Yeah, he lived until 1967 so he was a seven foot one. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh No, no, no, no, no. Okay. Now this guy, six foot seven, the Russian guy that I was talking about is seven foot one. His name is Nikolai value of, he's seven foot one. Holy Shit. So these guys were giants back then, but Carnera was only a six foot seven. That's still a big motherfucker. Yeah, Jesus. Yeah. Up until that time he was the tallest heavyweight in history. And I think today like what are the Klitschkos they're like six, six, yeah, same size and dude's, yeah, they like the same size. So this is Primo Carnera, but back then he was like a like a freak.

Speaker 3:          01:22:43       Yeah, I did. Um, what was it? I did a, this fundraiser,

Speaker 1:          01:22:49       he was 275 pounds. This guy was

Speaker 3:          01:22:51       naturally and he, and he, uh, that, that was like, by the way, the biggest size of any athlete? Yeah. Through like the like in the 80s, like I remember that like Lineman in the were

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       two 75 to 80 and in every team would have like a 300 pounder and you'd be like, Holy Shit, they got a 300 pound on the team and now the entire line, what the fuck is that? Is that human growth hormone? What is that? Is that steroids in the beef? It sounds, is that what that is? It's standard now. Everyone's is three 2130. What's happening is it's selective growing. What is it? Cellphones. Is it, this is the first couple of generations we were really understood nutrition and made sure the kids have vitamins growing up and they grew to their full potential. Is that what it is? Part of it is that, I bet that has to do a lot with it, right? Yeah. I think that is part of it. Yeah. And also put, now you have this thing where it's like you're, they are con like there's more education on just, you know, like for instance in sports everybody has, like you can be like, Hey, I want to be this weight and you're going to program, you need fucking 300 grams of protein a day and you need 5,000 calories.

Speaker 1:          01:24:02       Yeah. You need to do this type of workout and you're going to fucking swell up. You know, you can actually set that goal and somebody can tell you pretty much manufacture it. Like in knowing their, their science, this is what you need to do too. If you want to obtain that so you can execute that, you know, but back then they'd just be like, oh fuck. And I don't know. Yeah, there's definitely that. Like you definitely put on more size now than ever before. But what, what I'm saying is that the actual number of giant humans has increased. It's not just like the ability to put muscle on, it's like the size of people is just, it's more common to see these Primo Carnera guys in athletics today, these six foot seven just naturally gigantic human beings. Like that's, that's more common today. It just is.

Speaker 1:          01:24:46       So what the fuck is that? Why is it more common? Why is there two Klitschkos there's two giant six foot six guys or box and everybody up these two giant Russian dudes, you know, and just think about how many of those guys exist today? How many, how many giant human beings are out there? There's a dude, um, who fights in the UFC? Stephan drew, if he's fucking seven feet tall, man. Kids seven feet. Yeah. Yeah. I don't even think he's 25, seven feet tall. Can you know the world is not designed for you and your seven feet two man, he's giant. Semi shelties and other one's seven feet tall. Giant kickboxers Jesus Christ. Where the, you know this and I guarantee you have kids that are coming up today, the kids that are growing up and they're going to be, you know, coming to fruition or a coming to a full height rather a within the next decade they're going to be even more giant.

Speaker 1:          01:25:33       It's like people are going to get bigger and bigger and bigger till we like start morphing, you know, and we start super giant. We're going to be giants. There's no doubt about it man. As soon as they figure out a way to engineer the body selectively, we're going to figure out what's the optimum size you can be and people are just going to grow to that size that like a hundred years ago there was not a fucking bunch of six, six, 300 pounds people. Do you know how much the average soldier weighed in the civil war? How much? 125 pounds. Yeah. They were tiny little dudes. Tommy as a fifth grader. Yeah. That is not the same type of human being that we have today because people were malnourished. Everybody's catching fucking diseases is shit all over everything. Babies are dying. Nobody knows how to wash their hands.

Speaker 1:          01:26:21       Right. And it's a mess. That was a mess. Those are tiny ass little people. Those people lived in the 18 hundreds or a tiny ass little people. Yeah, we just have Gargantuan and they're getting bigger. These, these Shaquille O'Neal dudes. I did a fear factor which Kilo Neil and I have, I stand deck height, fuel deal. He's a, he's a grown man. I'm a grown man. His Dick is in my face. I mean he's just so different than me. It's just such a great quote. I'm standing next to him. We, and we do a countdown. It's hilarious because it's me, you know, I was like shot, count them down and he goes Whoa, Oh and you know the people go and do their stone. It was really cool cause he liked the show. So it was fun like having him coast with me for a day, but it's just so ridiculous. I'm like a little child standing next to this giant. I have super nice guy though.

Speaker 3:          01:27:12       Jonathan Ogden offensive tackle, six eight like three 40 played at and his hand. He just like, he just held to have my little fingers. It was like nice to meet you and like and like just squeezed a couple of fingers and I realized my hand couldn't even like get around, like even simulate a handshake and he also had a conversation with somebody, like as I was talking to him, like down here, I was like, yeah, so it's cool to me. He was like, yeah man, so this other, at the end I was like, I'm down. I'm like, Damn. I was like, hey man, like a kid. Like when your kid walks up to you and they're talking to and you're talking to another adult and you're right, just hold on and you're talking to the adult and they're like, but daddy and you're like, just hold on and you just talk over them. He did that to me like I was a child. I just looked up at him and I was like, it was nice to meet you. You're like pat at the top.

Speaker 1:          01:28:00       Go ahead. Yeah, it was dope. It was not like a human though. It was like a fucking superhuman. Yeah. It's amazing. The variance, you know, how much, how much people vary in, in the height and size like that. But yet we're still in the same species. Yeah. But a guy should kill Neil. It's like, it's such an extreme version of it. Fucking huge. It's friendly guy though. Super, Super Nice Guy. Yeah. Mike Goldberg did a whole season of shack versus with them. Oh yeah. He did a bunch of cool shit. Like that was gold box. Oscar de la Hoya. And you know, it was kind of funny. He did a bunch of different things. I am a, you know, do you know the other comic Bruce Bruce? Do you know him? He's a big dude. Big enormous guy. Not that tall, but write like 300 plus pounds. I sat next to him on a flight. Did I tell you this already know? And uh, I'd never met him before and I recognized him, so I was like, hey man, like, you know, uh, I'm a comic. And he was like, oh yeah, he's super fucking Nice. And he's just this big giant looking. Can I ask where this story goes?

Speaker 3:          01:29:02       Where? Sleep apnea? No. Okay. No, it's uh, uh, you know, 10 minutes into the flight, got braids and shit. So we get, we get delayed and first of all, we're flying la, Atlanta, and then I'm going to, I'm going on to Lauderdale. He's staying at, he lives in Atlanta, I guess. So everybody that comes on the plane, uh, who's black says something to him and I'm like, do you like, do you know these people? He was like, aw man, these people just, they just fans. And I was like, read, like everybody on the plane has stopped and they tell us there's a delay, you can get off the plane if you want. And some girl walks by and she's like, do you need something? And he's like, ah, I'd love sweet, like a candy bar. And then she's like, okay. And I'm like, who's that?

Speaker 3:          01:29:46       He's like, I dunno. It's like, that leads just buying you candy man. And he's like, yeah, pretty much. I was like, okay, whoa and sweet. Like, I can't tell you how sweet of guy he is. So we're, we get to let the girl comes back, gives them candy. I'm like, I love you. And he's like, I left. Thank you sweetie. He, she goes back, we take off, we started talking comedy and he's like, I'm doing this tour with a, you know, I'm torn with this person and doing shows with these people. And I'm asking him like, Oh, what do you think of so and so? And we're talking back and forth about people and he's like, I'm doing this show right now where I'm, uh, you know, doing some theaters with Mike Epps. I'm opening like for him at these massive theaters. And I was like, Mike Epps is a funny fucking dude.

Speaker 3:          01:30:25       Like, just a naturally funny guy because we're just like talking shit. Oh yeah, yeah. It was like, you know, that guy just turned to any situation funny. He's like, yeah, but, uh, ain't no mother fucker funnier than Andy Griffith. And I was like, what? Like, what'd you just say? And he's like, Andy Griffith. I was like, are you not Eddie Griffin? Right. Are we talking about Andy? The whistle shit. Yeah. He's like, aw man. And I'm like, are you serious right now? And he's like, you've been to Andy Griffith Museum. I'm like, what kind of questions that man? Like what kind of questions? And he's like, aw man, they got the, like the, the car from the, from the show, you can, you could sit in the car. They have like a set, but like with the kitchen, they used to show the kitchen, you can go there. You get all the Andy Griffith show you ever want.

Speaker 3:          01:31:10       I'm like, are we in the real world right now? And he loves any good man. He, I was like, I don't think I like anything as much as you like Andy Griffith. He's like, I love Andy Griffith. And I was like, clearly. And he knew, he was like, uh, you know, and I'm not exaggerating. He was like, you know, there was two, uh, black act as that ever appeared on the Andy Griffith show. And I was like, wow. He's like, one was a February 8th, 1963. Why the role of Tony? Are you saying the right data? You just know I'm making up the date, but he knew the day lets these people not all right. He knew the day we're going to heat this up on Google. He knew the exact date and he knew the role and the episode and then he was like, and the other one was April 19th, 1968 and that was when, remember when they couldn't find the mail. I'm like, no, I have not seen these episodes. Fuck member. When they couldn't find my mail. I was like, I swear to God and I was like, Holy Shit. Andy Griffith

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       is a shit man. I was like, Andy Griffith, real Andy Griffin is a shotgun. Love Andy Griffith man. Wow. Wow. This is a lot of people that had like p that pay homage to the classics like this dudes who are really get into like old movies and shows and, and I've met like super fans of some things that you don't expect. But that for me was so adolescent field. I saw Carol Burnett the other day. You did Dan. She looked good. She looked good. I'm telling you man. I mean, I think the lady is in her late seventies. She looked very healthy, smiling, laughing and talking to people. She, um, that show was great. Yeah, it was a great show. Well, it's interesting. We were, we were talking about this the other day, like there was like a big wave of a woman run shows back in there in the day with a woman was a star.

Speaker 1:          01:32:51       There was Laverne and Shirley, there was Mary Tyler Moore. There was road. Uh, there was a mod, remember mod and know, and then there's mod and then asthma on bad on nod. And I remember that there was a, there was a show that was like a big popular show. And then there was, um, the older lady who used to be a model ran the news room. The fuck was that? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Orange, Brown, Murphy Brown. That boring gas hypnotic. What did they do to get people to watch that show for all those years? What kind of long time? Hypnotism five. Yeah, there was a gang of them, but I mean that the, the era of, um, Carol Burnett was like, there was a, like Lucille Ball, there was a bunch of them, there was a bunch of them, like really strong women comedian presences. It's like Dan has changed quite a bit now.

Speaker 1:          01:33:43       Like the role that women have on these, like, you know, you have like girls like Chelsea who have their own show, but it's like her personality. It's not like, uh, like her being the head of a sitcom. And then there's, I'm Whitney Whitney who had a show that people didn't respond to that well, but then people said, well, it's going to be tweaked and they're gonna figure it out. But she, but genuinely people seem to like her. She just has to find like the right vehicle. Right, right. But how many of them are there these days? It's not, it's not like it used to be. Yeah. Especially what, well, also where they need to, you know, where they're getting their shot. You know what I mean? Like, you know, like how many, how many people are getting the opportunity to have their show, you know, because the, because the talent, there's still talent.

Speaker 1:          01:34:26       Just a bunch of talent out there. Like you know, there's definitely talented comics, female male comics out there and, but they have to get a shot to get there show. That seemed to be like that was an overdrive in that era that you're talking about if you were a women. Yeah. Women. But also I think just comics too. Like there was, there was an era of pushing the comic to get the show. And here's the thing that's funny that you, when you like why, how come not that many stand up, let's say have a show right now. Right, right. Like how many more? It's like bait and extension of the comic. You'd look back on that era and all of those shows were hits like the standup where the comic was elite. A lot of those were hits, man. Yeah. There was a few bombs though.

Speaker 1:          01:35:05       I was, I was there for a view. Yeah. But there's a watched a few, I was a part of a few that was for, I had my own Sitcom. Uh, you did a pilot for NBC once. Yeah. It was called, um, overseas. I don't even think it ever Erin anywhere. Even as a pilot. You shot the pilot though. Yeah, it was super expensive pilot. But the, um, the thing about like those, uh, development deals I tried to do at standups is that they would just throw a bunch of money at a comic and then get a bunch of like, you know, writers and supposedly had some success on other shows and throw as much shit against the wall and see how much of it sticks. Yeah. You know, and I think that it's, it's real hard for you to take the one thing that you're fucking awesome at, which is stand up.

Speaker 1:          01:35:54       The one thing that you really quick and complete, express yourself. You're uncensored, you're, you're producing it, you're directing it. Nobody's interfering with your, your vision of how the joke should play out. And there's a big difference between that and being on a set comp set and that that difference is it. There's a, it's really fun being on a good Sitcom. It's terrible being on a bad sitcom. It's terrible. And it's not as, Mo is not as much fun and it's not as rewarding as doing standup. It's just not, you know, for me at least it's like a, it's fun doing like a cool sitcoms. But if I had a choice between watching like the best sitcom ever or watching Richard Pryor do stand up, I want to watch Richard Pryor. That's the best stuff. The best stuff is stand up. So it's like you, you do shit that's not as good as the best stuff and it's just because they're paying you to do it.

Speaker 1:          01:36:43       That was how I was feeling about it. And the thing that you don't really love to do and that they're paying you to do, it takes all day and then you don't have as much energy or time leftover for the thing that you do love to do. And I can see that. So the only reason why you should do it is to get exposure for your standup. Yeah. Which I hear it like, I mean some of the comics that really alike doing comedy, doing standup, that's generally what you hear them say. It was like it's just going to drive more people to see my show. Yeah. That's how it should be. That's how it should be, man. That's how it should be. It's a, the art of standup comedy, he didn't get any respect for awhile in the 80s I think as a, as an end destination because everybody was like, you gotta get a Sitcom, you gotta get a Sitcom.

Speaker 1:          01:37:22       That's what Jerry Seinfeld did. This guy did the pilot in terms of like your career, like I did it in the middle of news radio alarm. It'll all, I was doing news radio. Yeah. Cause it was the same producer. So seed that and that's shelf spoiled his shit out of me man. Because they were so good. The writers were so good and they were crazy. They would, they were so nuts. They wouldn't even start a script till like two o'clock in the morning. Sometimes, and they would, she would show up and it would be like tape day or a rather, um, a rehearsal day and we would get like the first 30 pages and they're like, or the first five pages or whatever it was, they're like, we're going to give you the rest later. And then a scene two would come down at noon and they would shuffle down barefoot and slap it down.

Speaker 1:          01:38:03       They'd go back and they would, they would get to this state of sleep deprivation and come up with this really silly shit. And I suspect it was because nobody had informed them about the benefits of we'd really, I think if those guys were stoners, they weren't stoners and those are the guys were stoners. What they did sober was brilliant. You know, if they, if those guys were high, they could have come up with the most silly and ridiculous show in the history of the universe. How many seasons was that Sean, for five seasons. Five. Yeah. That was a longer, even now it was just too short of a syndication, like the normal syndication length. Oh, Mitt isn't syndicated. Oh, it isn't, but it's to, to, to episode short, we only did 98 instead of a hundred. And you're supposed to have a hundred so that they could sell it.

Speaker 1:          01:38:46       Yeah. But it didn't become popular until after it was canceled. Really? Yeah. Became popular when it would air on TV during like regular TV time, like seven o'clock and eight o'clock and late night and shit like that when it was syndicated and then people will like, this show's kind of fucking funny. Yeah. It's just gotten monkeyed around back then, man. Back in the day when when news radio was out, nobody knew where the fuck you where if they moved you from like Monday to Wednesday, you're done kid. Nobody knows. The other thing, like more to your point about the, uh, you know, when you're just in charge of your standup shows, man, you're talking about so many people are giving their input. You know, like the executive producers, writers, like so many people, we should really do this. We should really lose that. Well, I don't like it when you come out that way.

Speaker 1:          01:39:29       I don't, I don't like it. When you do that, I don't like it when you, Oh stop please. I don't care. We can only do this one way and the only way I'm going to get advice as is from funny people. I can't get advice for someone who's a business person. It's like, I just kind of tell you that. I think that approaching it this way, when they give you a comedy note, that's just like, I had a conversation with a guy and he's talking about podcasting because you guys have really nailed down your brand and I'm like, oh that's gross language. You're grouse. Yeah, that's the last thing we've done. Nailed down our brand. He's like, you know, I go, what do you mean by then? It's like, well you know, people know what kind of, you know what you're putting out there. It's like, you know you've really like well defined, your, your brand.

Speaker 1:          01:40:20       My brand. What is that? Yeah. Fuck you talking about the edge. It's like show Biz talk. Well, we're trying to, right now we're, we're working on is development deal, but we just don't want to sign with anyone. We really want to work on developing its brand. Yeah. Brand. Are you, are you a bottle of ketchup? You fuck. Define what do you need a brand? Sorry is silly bitch. If you're that defined you, then you become immobile. You become locked into an emo Phillips type character. Oh yeah. Imagine going Cmo Phillips and he drives to, tries to do stand up and be like, hey, hey, fuck head. Why aren't you acting like you're poised it up, man. We ended up, we ended up shithead. What's this? You just standing there telling me about butter. Okay. Get a move on with I came to see your, your fucking funky act.

Speaker 1:          01:41:09       I love it man. Well, if you're not going to do it, where's Judy Tenuta? I want to see your weird shit. Yeah. I'm here to see your, your whole dirt. You ever know. How do you go from doing that to try to do just regular standup? I only give him shit because I know he tells his opening acts not to swear. Oh really? Yeah. Well I've heard from [inaudible]. I don't know exactly. I wasn't really there. They could have been a bunch of bitter twats but uh, I don't remember who it was. They said they got harassed for being too dirty, opening for him. Man, that sucks. I might've been half rotten. I kinda wish I remember who it was, what happened to have her, I've had it going to get them back in here, man. I've had it said passive aggressive love half Ron for it.

Speaker 1:          01:41:51       I mean, you know, opening for somebody like say fuck a Lotta and you're like, Oh, do I? And they're like, oh no, no, no, that's not a thing. And you're like, you just made it a thing because you just hinted as a thing in um, in Boston they used to like always decide like headliners would decide who had oh porn and they would, you know, there get him Outta here. He breaks the fuck meter. It was like, that was like the big thing. They didn't want to go on and after anybody dirty because if you wanted to have any sort of shock value to your comedy whatsoever, but that just means your comedies on that. Good. Yeah, that's how I always fell. Sure the bass guys can go on after Andy Body. It doesn't matter. I seen, yeah, it's just, especially when people know who they are. Like I got a chance to see Hedberg a bunch of times and I saw Hedberg in front of people who are fans and I got to see a Hedberg in front of people who had no idea who he was. And it was a big difference.
