Speaker 1:          00:00:04       Dirty bitches. That's when you saw him. You dirty bitch. And I need, I need a little, a little more rhythm to pull it off. The Joe Rogan experience podcast today, Tuesday, September 4th, 2012 because how the Blanco is dead. That's me. That's me. They got that result of Blanca Lady, who's that? She's the cocaine cowboys lady. I still have not seen it. I was talking about this. We'll talk about this later. Um, I got to do a commercial Charlie's parents podcasts. It's broad, deep dye on it.com. That's o and n I t what is on it? And it's to supplement company. We make Alpha brain and a bunch of shit that I talk about on the podcast all the time. Uh, the one thing I can tell you is everything that, uh, we sell it on a.com is all stuff that I've used, I believe in. I endorse, I wouldn't get behind anything that wasn't legit.

Speaker 1:          00:01:01       And the fascinating thing to me about Alpha brain is that it's a, you know, like all the, all the information from the tropics of like you're interested in the subject of nootropics, which is like, it's all nutrients that have been shown to have a positive effect on human neurochemistry. The idea is that you, your, your brain produces more, more juice. You have more ability to string together sentences. You have more neurotransmitters. I don't understand it. That shit goes away with time, your receptacles and all that stuff, it starts to die away. Everything does. Or going down, Greg, it's going down. But what I've, what I've found is that I benefit greatly from, I take a lot of vitamins and uh, I take a lot of really what I believe are a very effective supplements and I eat a lot of really good food. You've got to be healthy because if you don't, this motherfucker will fail on you.

Speaker 1:          00:01:57       It will fall apart. You'll crash into the rocks. Like you've got to keep it together, bitches. And that is what Ana is all about. The company is basically set up. Everything we sell is stuff that will improve you with the strength and fitness equipment, kettle bells and battle ropes. There's like the best way you could ever work out if you want to develop functional strength, that directly translates into any athletic endeavor. Kettle bells and battle ropes are fantastic. Battle ropes are these giant fucking ropes and he flail him through the air and you do it for like sprints of 30 seconds and oh, it's brutal. So those and kettle bells, they will last you for to the end of time. The battle ropes, he can't give me any cheaper than you can get it on [inaudible] dot com and the kettle bells, there's like as cheap as you can humanly sell them. We're sending cannon balls through the mail. It's not that easy. It's ridiculous. I mean, that's where senator, I mean some of them are 90 pounds. You're sending a 90 pound fucking cannon ball through the mail. That shit is expensive as fuck. It's just like an Alpha brain. If you want to take the ropes and make them yourself, go get a bunch of

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       ropes. It's really expensive. You'd be amazed. Yeah. Those really big, heavy, big, thick, heavy ropes. Those are expensive as fuck. You know, it's not easy to target and you got to go to a, you can get them though. You can go to nautical stores. I just don't think they usually sell them in, in, in the length sizes. Yeah. It's probably hard to get, but you can definitely get it. I mean, we got it. And so just, uh, it's just a big heavy rope, you know, if he can make your own, make your own. If you've got some extra giant rope playing around, he could probably do with chains too. If you want to go fucking crazy rampage Jackson style or like 17,000 tennis shoes. Yeah. I mean, the idea is like the, you're using your whole body in like a whipping effect in shoelaces. The wind, like the, uh, the amount of a wind it takes to work out what can do like these 32nd sprints, 20 seconds off, and then 32nd sprints. That's like, uh, this protocol of different exercises you do with the battles are fucking brutal, man. It's like nothing. It gets you tired. Like nothing ever do outside of like wrestling a man. Not that you do any man wrestling. I wrestled a rope man once. Rope, man, that was a fucking workout. It's alive. Uh, the father off me off a water bed when I was two.

Speaker 3:          00:04:13       Just kidding. You're the only grown man that I know that still uses. Just kidding. I know. What's, what's the source version of that? Yeah. Like what's the adult version of that? Like you don't have to say no, you're just kidding. I know. You know the original one. No, no, no, no. Yeah. We might not to say that instead of like, just kidding or not really. I think it was from, we were like, you know, ten nine, oh, I never am more committed. That's way better. Black people used to say it in my town. They'd be like, Nah, no.

Speaker 2:          00:04:50       All right. That's my new thing now on at.com o n n I t go get yourself some fucking Kettlebell. Sun Hemp protein powder. We've got all kinds of groovy shit and it's all the supplements have a 30 day. All right, 30 pill rather, 100% money back guarantee.

Use the code name Brogan and you will save yourself 10% off you dirty bitches. All right, Brian, cue the music. Let's make it official. Greg Fitzsimmons is here,

Speaker 3:          00:05:23       Rogan experience, Joe Rogan podcast by night all day,

Speaker 2:          00:05:35       and then that happens. This is what happens. Every podcast you have these fucking awesome conversations. He'd get rolling and then we play that music and all of a sudden we've got to start from scratch again and we forget what we were just talking about that we were like saving for the podcast. What were we talking? I said, we have a very inefficient way of starting to show and we have never analyzed it until this moment and have thought the best

Speaker 4:          00:05:58       like talk show like tonight show thing would be as soon as the guests walk in the stage door backstage, they should just be getting filmed and then play pieces of that. Yeah. You know, cause who gives a shit? Once they sit down, they tee it up. It's like I can tell you the end of George Clooney story. His mom made cookies and then uh, she got hit on, Oh fuck, fuck about your pre packaged dry ass story that you've done before. Or they talk, you know, me talk shows now you see guys promoting a film. There's this website that tells you all the late night shows guests for the next two weeks and you'll see like Paul Rudd go fucking daily show tonight. She'll Laderman cone and you know, and then start working your way down. So you're on like a Jimmy, uh, what's the guy who does a, the late, late NBC show?

Speaker 4:          00:06:52       No, no, no, no. It's like he does music. It was on MTV, not Jimmy Carson Daly. Carson. Carson Daly is still on television for 10 years. I like his taste. I find a lot of weird, creepy bands and movies from that guy just because he's, he's kind of like cutting edge hipster. Like he, there's a reason why. Like he was on MTV, our same generation. Now he's older so he does give some cool tastes of music once in a while you watch it. When I catch it I always, I'm interested cause he doesn't pick little random cards out of the blue that you maybe you haven't heard of like music wise, at least we're movie wise. I don't know. I don't think he's bad. I I'll take him over. Leno you no I never said he was bad. She's fucking hard.

Speaker 1:          00:07:38       Those things are really hard to do. It's really hard to do. Is Talk Show like that. It'd be even remotely interesting. It's so segmented. It's like you never really get a chance to get rolling. You're just trying to like interject and say witty things in this really brief story. It's like you barely get to know someone like under the, the, the idea of this, this breaking it up and for these long ass commercials and you know, you talk in between the break and then when we come back, you know, and then it just, it's so fake and Hokey. You removed

Speaker 4:          00:08:09       yourself and the good guests just say, you know what I'm going to do? He's going to introduce me and I'm going to tell a great fucking story. Then we're going to go to commercial. But if you try to fake that, you're hanging out talking. That's, that's torture. Special recording music. An Alienware computer, right? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:08:25       Yes. It's hard to do, man. It's hard to do that job. That's a really difficult job. This is way easier. It's way easier to do a podcast. Like there's a, yeah, yeah. Cause the podcast, you just start talking, you know, a show like that. Like you have to, you have to operate within like this really narrow frame of time. Like what if this is like a really intense subject, something that is a really controversial to you and the person that you're talking about it with. Sometimes it might require

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       a long time to delicately work through some weird subject I get. The guy comes on it and he's talking about his wife just had an abortion or something that could do it. Yeah, it could. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you know, it's like there's, there's certain things that when you're, you're talking about it, you need some time. You don't want to have to go, uh, go to pre k and you know like, come on. Really? Okay, we'll be back. Cause the host half

Speaker 4:          00:09:21       fill every second. You get uncomfortable when the things not going well. So they, they jump in like some dysfunctional enabler.

Speaker 2:          00:09:26       Yeah. The commercial ruins the conversation. It ruins it, it fucking kills it. It's the death of it. And the idea that you have to do a commercial at a certain time, like opie and Anthony have commercials, but they just talk until they're done. And then they go, all right, well you guys want to take a break, let's take a break. Placement commercials will write back. And it's completely organic. Yeah. It's like you're watching separate shows. You're like, you're watching one hour and a half show where they didn't go to commercial and then another hour show when they didn't go to commercial and then they'll go to commercial.

Speaker 4:          00:09:54       Well and also you don't get the sense with opie and Anthony or podcasts that we're talking the way to human beings talk. There's a rhythm and there's a pace and there's not, there's not high Iq moments. Every three seconds. Like when you watch a monologue in an interview, you had 20 writers mapping every word. So to me it's off putting, and I think it is to, a lot of American sitcoms are the same way. Human beings don't have conversations the way they do on sitcoms. So that's why people started wanting reality TV. They were like, this shit is, makes me feel uncomfortable because it's not real.

Speaker 2:          00:10:28       Right? Yeah. It's, it's clumsy. It's like the way the president talks to the, to the people, that's the same sort of thing. It's the same sort of animal. It's like seeing gene Simmons on his show. That's just an annoys the fuck out of me because they stuffed, this is fake. It's just a really dumb fake, like he glued dildos to his hand, you know, like really like this. I have to believe that you glued a Dildo to your hand. So unfortunate. Do you know, I guess it's just trying to keep doing it. You know Bobby Lee, right? Sure.

Speaker 4:          00:10:59       Apparently. Uh, apparently he's talking about this. I'm not, I'm not outing him about this when he goes right.

Speaker 2:          00:11:05       Pretty fine. How many times have people had to say that statement in reference to a box store, which I love. Bobby Lee loved. I really do love truly.

Speaker 4:          00:11:15       Well, you know why? Because he's Vaughn, he's a broken toy and he knows it. We all know it. So you don't have to. So that's why I call him the story. He is, but he goes on the road, he buys three bottles, a Elmers glue, and at night he pours it on his hands and then peels it off. Are you serious? That's so cool. I heard that and I was like, I want to fucking do that dude. You know those markers, the crayola markers, you can bite off the end and then take out the ink out of it. You put that in a glue overnight and we'll turn whatever code, color marker. So you put it on your hand. You can make it like green hall cans. So it looks you're peeling off. Nice tip for Halloween.

Speaker 2:          00:11:51       Yeah, you should. What are you 12 wrong

Speaker 5:          00:11:54       was wrong with you, man. Like a stone labor action show hole in his brain, folks. He took too much ecstasy. He's like that commercial where they show the whole do a three d of his head. God, can we just talk about how it acts to see, it's just so amazing. There you go. So I'm going to hone his brain around. Is this really breaks apart your life in front of you? Like really accurately? Like it's really nice. It's if you, if you talk about, I don't want to just help, don't do ecstasy, but in my opinion, uh, like if like mushrooms never really seemed like they kind of helped me when I'm like, yeah, that's cool. If was look like butterflies and stuff where exits, he actually kind of like, like almost like you're just start talking about shit that's bugging you and he like, like I was really angry the other day and I just kept on going like, why am I so angry?

Speaker 5:          00:12:44       Everything I'm saying is anger and it like, it really showed me immediately like what was wrong with me at that point? It was like a psychiatrist and a pill. It was weird. Have you done it much eval done once or something budget at once? Yeah, it's don't do it, but it's amazing. Amazing. I had a, I had a positive experience, like I learned something from it, but I also realized that the physical toll yeah. Is a pretty substantial, yeah. Your body takes a big flood. A lot of five HTP and a lot of counter fucking XSE fix my brain juice and stuff. So I do it right. Like I've never, the next day felt like shitty. Like lot of people wake up the next day and feel depressed and they, you know, I've never felt that that was originally how on it was conceived. Then roll on and roll off or what hills.

Speaker 5:          00:13:36       Those are some of the first products and the idea of being to help reboost your, your neurotransmitters have to go on a binge. Yeah. I love them. Instead of us working towards people, you know, becoming sober, we work toward fixes over juice. Just adopt change. We just say it's too fun. It's too fun to not indulge in my head, man. It's cold. A liver cleanse or something. What's that? Can you turn these down, turn you down? What's going on here? I feel like I'm at an ACDC concert except it to you guys talking better? Yeah, that's great. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, he's on a different channel or something. Well y'all ever separate volume chart. It's crazy. That sounds so deep. We all have our own separate volume. Well, who'd you have on last? They probably turned it up. I don't remember. Whoever it was probably had come in your ears. Whoa. How dare you. How dare you? Silly boy. Yeah, that ecstasy on good for you boy. Yeah. Alright. Eventually it's going to rot your head out. I literally do it once every four months. Something like that. I don't do it like every week or some crazy, but even once every four months you PR that's hit and they kind of hard. Well they say that

Speaker 6:          00:14:52       it does fuck with your receptors that you can't get happy. It's like same thing with opiates. If you, if you take them too much, you clog up their receptors and the only thing that gets through is the drug. That's why it's so hard to get off of those fucking pills I can get in is brutal to get off. Oof.

Speaker 5:          00:15:10       I could easily just stock, never do ecstasy again.

Speaker 1:          00:15:13       Real friends. Several people that I knew and grew up with who became pill, pill, pill people. Yeah, I've seen it happen. I've seen people lose everything. See them lose their shit for pills.

Speaker 6:          00:15:24       Yeah. It's creepy weird rd. One he went from taking the pills cause it's basically heroin. It's the same makeup. And then he couldn't, he didn't have pills. One time at a club and some happy, little helpful doorman said, well why don't you just snort some heroin? I got some heroin and boom

Speaker 1:          00:15:43       over. Wow, she's Christ.

Speaker 6:          00:15:48       I took a right shoulder surgery a couple summers ago and they gave me Vicodin way too easily. You know, Revit. My surgeon gave it to me. Then my, a general practitioner gave it to me and uh, I had a supply gone and I took that shit for six months. I was taking not a ton, maybe three, four a day, but it started to feel like when I didn't have one I was not feeling good and then when I stopped it was some fuck those toughest two days of my life.

Speaker 1:          00:16:15       Yeah, I've heard that the withdrawal is like almost some people they just can't take it. It's like a torture and they just quit and they go back on the pills and say, you know, I'm, I'm just can't do it. Yeah. It's terrifying how easy it is to get them. It's terrifying how like quick people are to take painkillers. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:16:35       I'm good. I mean I like drinking more than any of this, you know, like I think that's just something that I could relax, have a few drinks, feel good, but I, I don't never got into having like cocaine and it seems like that's just like once you, you do it once the next day you wake up and you feel like, shit, I don't want to do that again. You know?

Speaker 1:          00:16:53       Yeah. Yeah. I don't get addiction of pills and I think that opiate thing is a totally different monkey. I think once it grabs you, it just grabs you by the balls and just intertwines itself with your system. When you get that monkey on your back, that's a completely different experience. I think the opiate one seems to be more of a intense physical experience.

Speaker 6:          00:17:17       Yeah, it is. I'll tell you what, I've got a friend who's been doing it for five, six, seven years. Very successful. Screenwriter cannot write without it. When he take cause writing is a, it's scary and if you lose all your fear and you write with abandoned, that's when you do good writing. So he started taking them because it got him out of his writer's block. But now you start taking it just to get normal. That's when you're in trouble. When you're not even getting hot, you're just trying to crawl back.

Speaker 1:          00:17:45       They're terrifying and it's, you know, the people, and people will call me a hypocrite because I smoked so much weed. Hypocrite if a current, but I can stop and take a week off and I feel no physical effects. Like I did recently, went to Hawaii. I didn't get high for a week. I didn't, I didn't bother me even a little bit. It's like there's no withdrawal effects. There's nothing. I don't think people understand that. I mean, some people think that there's some sort of a psychological withdrawal effect that some people go through. And then there's people that just, their body just completely behaves differently than the normal person's body. Yeah. And they have much more of a proclivity towards addiction. You know, there's some people apparently that like any sort of a change in a state of consciousness,

Speaker 6:          00:18:31       the brain, they can look at chemicals in the brain and see an addictive brain in the way it behaves. It's very different.

Speaker 1:          00:18:37       It's fascinating. And so there are, I mean, I would never say, I mean, look, some people die from eating peanuts. You know, I would never say that mom, you know, my is my experience in, in taking anything. It's the same as yours. So for some people, pop might just be this impossible ride into the depths of hell. I mean, I don't know. I mean, and then immediately they're hooked on it. It's not to me, but to someone's with some really funky, weird genetics. Someone that can die from cranberries or some shit. You know what I mean? Like one of those weird people.

Speaker 6:          00:19:09       Oh, I mean, addiction in my family, everybody. I mean, my dad, my dad died at 51 basically drinking and smoking and you know, three and a half packs a day. And uh, I'm sorry, I hate hearing that. And aunts and uncles, everybody's got addiction. So I quit drinking 21 years ago. I was 25 years old when I quit drinking. I remember Greg Pre and post. Yeah. Yeah. And it was like a, for me it was like, I know I got to, so the addiction shifts, you go from one thing to the next. And for me it was, uh, drinking, went to working, went to sex. And I really believe that. I don't know what a sex addict is. We all want to fuck all the time. You know, what's, what's the, what's the line you cross between a healthy libido and sex addicts? You did. And it was very unhealthy. Like she did not leave the bed all day and just wanted to fuck or masturbate all day.

Speaker 1:          00:20:06       Well, some, some people are just trying to erase whatever is fucking with their head. Some they're running horrible vision from their past, you know, terrified memories, molestation, whatever the fuck it is. Some people just trying to just rub that out there. Just, you know, they're just trying to masturbate to heighten their experience with, they don't have to think about that for a brief moment. You know, there's, there's a lot of people out there that we're fucked with when they were kids. I mean, it's a, it's a terrifying number. It really is.

Speaker 6:          00:20:37       I kind of get wary to, when I see somebody who works way too hard and never lets up on themselves, I always think you're fucking hiding from something, you know, they're not no balance, real relationship.

Speaker 7:          00:20:48       It's just people can definitely get crazy. They can, well, it's, it's, it's hard because you get so focused on success and then you're dealing with a bunch of other ruthless motherfuckers who are focused on success. So you have to like up your game and that's, that's like the whole drive of modern man and people get way Douchey or that way. It's like you're responding to competing against each other and you all do shit out. Worse and worse do shit

Speaker 6:          00:21:15       documentary called happy. You can get it on Netflix and it's uh, it's like a, you know, a very academic, quantifiable look at happiness and how it transcends cultures. They started out showing this guy in India who pulls a fucking wreck, Shaw and he lives in a tent with his family and the guys, you know, it sounds fucking corny. The Dude's happy, you know, they followed them and they interviewed them and they say that 50% of your happiness is just your wiring. You, here's your fucking DNA, here's the juices in your body. Here's how people, like they showed a woman who'd been run over by a truck, she was a beauty queen and her face is fucking mangle. It's hard to look at her. And she returned to her happiness level within a couple of years. Same thing with somebody who's depressed. They can hit lotto within a year. They've settled back at their baseline. So that's half. Then 20% is shit like status, career, money, and then 30% is shit. Like what you do flow, getting into exercise, getting into martial arts, getting into, if you're a writer, getting lost in something, that's the other 30% so you have to strive to control that 30% by not letting the 20% get any bigger and giving yourself the room to, you know, have that balance. And it seems like exercise, like the number one thing.

Speaker 7:          00:22:35       Yeah, that's a huge part. You've got to keep your body alive. How to keep it moving. He could keep stressing it. Got to keep making it keep regenerating. He keeps sending impulses into it. Firing your hormonal system, going to, you got to force herself to work. If you don't force your body to work and wants to just give the fuck up, you use it or lose it. But they say the same thing with, I was saying before how they, this is where I heard about this in a documentary about how your, uh, what are the chemicals that make you happy again?

Speaker 6:          00:23:04       Yeah. Your endorphin receptors start to dry out. They start to die and the more you use them, the less they die. So they say try different activities, learn a new language, try a new sport, travel somewhere. You haven't been

Speaker 7:          00:23:20       navy. I don't discount the idea of any like really big. So I dog experience for, for helping you. I've, I've, I've learned a lot about myself doing them, you know, and he and the regular one that I do have the isolation tank to start just getting high and getting that thing, you know, it's, it's mind blowing enough. You know, I have, I have some pretty intense visionary experiences doing, do you remember them?

Speaker 1:          00:23:45       Clearly? Some of them. Some of them I remember really clearly the one of talked about it before. It's so retarded. But uh, it did, it really did happen. I was in the jungle and I was walking through the jungle and there was a bunch of people, we were barefoot and they were talking and I knew their language. I understood what they were saying. The language was not English, it was a different language. They were talking and I understood it in their language in my head. And then I freaked out and then I said, what the fuck am I? And then when I freaked out, I spelled it out to myself like in English, like what the fuck am I doing? I am listening to a language and I understand it in that language but I said that in English and then I snapped out of it and woke up and it was the co repeal this thing because just like when you have this conversation with me and I know exactly what you're saying cause I speak English, I knew exactly what they were saying but it was not English, but I knew what the intent was.

Speaker 1:          00:24:51       I knew exactly what they were saying and I understood it in their own language. It was freaky as fuck cause it's so real.

Speaker 6:          00:24:59       So you had two selves in a way. There was the guy watching the guy speaking the language, standing, observing. Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:25:05       Yes, yes. Well that's what woke me up out of it. I couldn't stay in it. It was so crazy that I couldn't stay in it. It was just, it was like what I was, I wasn't capable of holding the hallucination.

Speaker 6:          00:25:17       You ever think about that though? Because I think that that has a lot to do with maybe happiness or maybe Saturday is that we all do have a couple of voices. You have the guide judging yourself and then you have your id, you know, your animal impulses. And uh, you know, Freud would say it's like your, you know, your, your ego and your super ego and that basically you are observing yourself all the time and the guy that's observing you is the fucking asshole. He's the one that socializing you and getting you to do what's appropriate, which you need to a certain degree. But the balance within that, I think it's the distance between the two voices. Uh, you know, obviously if he completely became transcendent, maybe, maybe the Dalai Lama has one voice and how close can you get those voices?

Speaker 1:          00:26:05       Hmm. Really close. Yeah. Well you know, you, there is the momentum live and then there's the, every now and then you are like objective assessment of the life that you're living on momentum. Like sometimes you're just, life is on momentum for like long slides and then you need like another perspective on yourself. You need to go, what's, it's going to slow down? What's going on here buddy? How are you really thinking how you really live in? I think that those reset situations they can get in life, whether they're a strong yoga class, you know, whether it's, uh, you know, right.

Speaker 2:          00:26:42       The why that I could do it too. It can be extra. Fuck. Yeah. We could realize like, Holy Shit, I'm a fucking loser. I'm out there driving drunk. Yeah. For sure. That could fucking snap you over into a realistic perspective on what you're,

Speaker 6:          00:26:58       and the other voice then steps up those, those little epiphany is going to happen. And then all of a sudden that, that guy that was in the flow, it's like, dude, get in the back seat. I got the wheel for a little while. You're going to get it back on the road here. You know? And it's like, uh, you know, for me, having a wife and kids, uh, and not drinking, I don't have much escape. So I really do struggle with that. Like the guy that's telling me to do the right thing and I realized I drive a fucking Prius. I have college savings accounts for my kids. I fucking exercise. Like it's great stuff, but there's a part of me that feels like that animal inside, you know, and I'm not going to fuck around, you know, I'm not going to drink. Uh, so I try to find other ways and part, part of it is just being a clown when I'm out with my wife, I fuck around, but everybody parking attendant, waiter, I just, to me it's like being out with her and having fun as a fucking greatest and making her embarrassed and she protest, but she loves it and that's a relationship.

Speaker 6:          00:28:00       Know really funny. That sounds like fun. That's what I was looking for him. Yeah. I put a Napkin on my head at a restaurant last week and she actually got mad at me because I wouldn't take it off. It was like a really nice restaurant.

Speaker 2:          00:28:13       I want to see this such a, it's Simmons sense of humor moment. You just love, just love being able to do that though.

Speaker 6:          00:28:24       Do it. And realize that you are so different from me. That's what, that's what you're saying. Cause she grew up, she grew up in New York City in a fucking not a great neighborhood and she's sophisticated chick. You know, she got her masters in social work and, and you know, but she's not wild at all. She's very dressed down. But she accepts me because she's been, she grew up around insanity. Right, right, right. So it's a perfect combination. And she read, she reigns me in peacefully. She's not a nagging wife, she's not a ballbuster, but she is almost that other voice that gently I just watch her and she peacefully brings me back into my kids. You know, sometimes, you know, sometimes you, you go away and you come back and you see your kid and it's like you're not connected and you gotta you gotta work your way back in. And she's like, my guide, she brings me back into it.

Speaker 2:          00:29:11       That's awesome man. Yeah. If you can find someone, you, you just Joe with them and you enhance each other. That's what relationships are all about. The, I mean that's what we all hope for, but it's the crazy thing is how rare that is. What it's worth too. I don't think. Sure. Not a perfect soulmate. It's you know, but I mean, how many people do you know that are truly happy in their relationship?

Speaker 6:          00:29:32       Oops. What is the percentage, you know, how many people do you know that are struggling? How many people you know that fight a rally? Half. Probably the married couples I

Speaker 4:          00:29:42       know really like have a like to the point where they say it out loud. It's a thing. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:29:46       Yeah. I would say that you're, yeah, I would agree with you. I think the people that I come in contact with, it's about half, half of them seem like nice couple, look at that. They seem friendly and seemed like they enjoyed each other's company and then half of them snipe at each other and you know, and they do it right in front of you. Oh man, that's so rude. You know what I'm doing. You know what I'm doing. Just stop it. Stop it. Now do you see what he does? You see it right? This is what I deal with. Oh, those relationships are ruthless to watch man. Cause that's out in public. You can imagine what it's like behind closed doors. You know. Did you see that video of a basketball player who was a first round draft pick? Did you see that Brian, the dude beat his girlfriend up and did it on camera.

Speaker 7:          00:30:34       Oh yeah. Yes. Prep his daughter. Like was it in front of his daughters? Were a little girl there. Are you talking about like he reached over the fence? No, no, no, no. This was um, it was, it looked like it was like some sort of a hotel or a or a apartment lobby or something like that somewhere where they had a security camera wherever it was. He's this big fucking dude, big super athlete basketball player. And he like kicks her to the ground and smacks her in the head and you're watching us. It's terrifying. She's really little man. She's not a big person and he is giant and apparently he just beat her ass and they sentenced him to a bunch of different shit. Man. They sentenced him to like all told, I think he has to go to jail for like three years. And uh, yeah. And he, he just, when he probably dropped the fucking $20 million contract, you should see the video to the video is crazy. He collapses in the courtroom, collapses and it was like, oh no, no, no, no, no. Fell down. Collabed I mean it was, it was really fucking intense. It's terrifying. I mean, he realized that he was going to go to jail for three fucking years.

Speaker 4:          00:31:51       You know what sucks about that is that ain't gonna change the dude and that ain't going to change any other domestic abuser putting people in jail. It's like, why isn't there more like, you know, especially in the inner city where you see people with less father figures and you see more violence to, to really make it a part of schools that you learn how to respect women, how to respect, you know, the opposite sex. Because it is something that is cyclical and it is cultural. You see a higher instance of domestic abuse with poor people and you know that should jail doesn't change that shit. It just causes more anger.

Speaker 7:          00:32:24       Yeah. It, it, it's not like it's a great place where they're going to, you know, sit around and do Iowasca and find their spirits of realize where they went wrong and the path to enlightenment surrounded by dudes. Yeah. It's a mess. The whole idea is a mess. And then you get into the fact that there's private prisons in this country and that that's one of the most mind boggling facts about American culture and just makes you wonder like, what is, what is the intention of the people running this fucking place where they've allowed so they got vacancies, they're losing money. You gotta fucking get some reservation people out there. That's what the cop side, their reservation is for the prisons. Yeah. It's almost like that, huh? Yeah. It's funny that like the, the police officer's unions will actually, uh, lobby and vote. They like try to make sure that certain drugs aren't made legal and like they have a, Oh shit.

Speaker 7:          00:33:20       Yeah, sure. It makes sense. Yeah. Police officers in unions or not police officer's unit, but um, uh, what would they call them? What did they call the people that worked at jails, corrections officers, corrections officers, corrections officers. They will actually like use their money and influence to try to make sure the drugs stay illegal. Speaking of which, number one, domestic abusers in the country, corrections officers. Really, Jesus Christ, super high rate of alcoholism. Or I read this book about singers. It's a terrible job. It's terrible for them, man. I mean, I don't have anything against corrections officers. I, it's a terrible place to be, to be just completely surrounded by people who are locked in a cage and you're not, and you walk amongst them all the time and they can just take a fucking free run at you at any moment. You live your life and constant stress.

Speaker 7:          00:34:11       Yeah. Yeah. I don't, I don't envy them by any stretch of the imagination. I think that if you're going to really take, being, uh, putting someone in a jail and reform seriously, you're going to have to come up with a way better method than what they're doing. This is ridiculous because this is a reforming anybody, there was a, I read this book about Sing Sing. This journalists went undercover as a prison guard for two years and he came out of it. He divorced his wife, he was an alcoholic and he was living in a fucking one bedroom shack. His whole life fell apart and he said that the, the alcoholism on the inside, he said, it's just end. It becomes consuming. It becomes a challenge that you take with you when you leave work. It's not you go to your job, you finish and then you go have your life.

Speaker 7:          00:34:56       It becomes these motherfuckers and I'm going to do this and it eats you up. You become part of it. Yeah. Human beings are weird as fuck. Trying to figure out how our behavior lends us astray or leads us astray rather and how we can try to get it back on track if it's at all even possible like as a, as a group of us. It's like when you look at the, the, the just the massive amount of crazy human momentum type behavior where we're just on our momentum. Like, here's the thing in New York where they had to recently pass something that makes rabbis have to get consent first before they suck your kids. Dick suck. Yes. Do you know when you circumcise a child, the rabbi that traditionally will suck upon the boy's penis to stop the bleeding now? Yes, yes, yes. This is all Jewish.

Speaker 7:          00:35:50       I don't know what sect of Judaism. I don't really care what they call themselves. Whatever. Silly people do this. It's real. It's they've, they've had babies die in very recent times because the baby will get herpes from the mouth of the, the whatever. I think they called them. Loyal. Yeah. Sense of tradition. There's a guy that's like, there's this nutty fucking video of this guy defending it and he explains it in, in the, the word, the Hebrew word, which means to suck like that. It's strictly says if that's how you're supposed to deal with that. So that's what they're doing. So, and you're just discounting my, my thought is that you're just discounting that this fucking baby's not going to remember this experience. You know? How do we not know that that's some nightmare in the back of his mind, like constantly fucking with them.

Speaker 7:          00:36:37       They did. Cutting the Dick is where it starts cutting a deck and then sucking it. It's, it's, you know, they say tannic shit. It's, it's tribal. It's fucking, and it all goes back to shit. It's like, you know that the American Medical Association no longer recommend circumcisions in third world countries they do to prevent aids and uh, other, uh, that's never got that. How is getting your dick cut going to prevail? It used to be because the, the fold around the crowd would that good. You're going to get aids that way. Really? Really? It's so ridiculous. I think it gets infected more because there's shit that gets in there like wash your Dick. You don't get it. That's my point. We got running. People can't even wash the, Oh, so because we don't have running water. They're getting aids through. They're there for skins, which is true. Therefore, skin makes aids.

Speaker 7:          00:37:26       Well, anything that folds back around the gland, like a vagina basically collects way more diseases than a penis. You know, like men don't catch aids almost ever so straight up sex with a woman who has aids. But if you've got a vagina, you've got a really good chance of getting aids. If you have sex with somebody, if you have any kind of tear in your vaginal wall or ceilings or floors or shades or blinds, your lips, oo, slats. Uh, do you know that there's a doctor who doesn't believe that it's terrifying when someone, when you're too stupid to know who's dumb because there's this guy who's a, uh, his name is Dr Peter Duesberg and I've read all his stuff and I know that he's a professor of biology. I believe the University of California Berkeley. It's like a legit guy. And his whole idea is that HIV is not what causes AIDS. Oh yeah. I heard about the president of South Africa said the same fact titty really the biggest aids country. And the other way I met HIV before and I was talking about transmitting diseases. Nowadays, I am way too stupid to understand who's right and who's wrong then because obviously there's a bunch of geneticists and a bunch of disease specialist who completely disagree with him and they think that HIV does cause aids. I wish I was smart enough to know what the fuck who's where. It's ridiculous.

Speaker 6:          00:38:50       Well it's all shit happening at a molecular level. It's all, it's all guesses. It's, but it's percentages and if you say that when we see these symptoms of a immune deficiencies happening and people there have lesions in her losing weight, then we often find that before that they, you know, uh, that, that the immune leads to the lesions and all of the outbreak of aid. So why not play those odds since we'll never know the actual truth if there even is one.

Speaker 7:          00:39:15       Do you think that's what they're doing? I what Duisburg is saying is that there, it's linked to partying. What he's saying is that it's a dude's do like, um, math and go crazy poppers, poppers and Emile nitrates. Apparently those poppers are unbelievably bad for you. Like, like instant brain damage and that doing that partying on a regular basis like that just wrecks your immune system.

Speaker 6:          00:39:41       Well that's, I mean it's why third world countries get aids more is because when you're malnourished and your system is worn down, you Terry easier, your tissues break open and your immune system can't fight back as much. So it's, you know, it's, it's about, you know, wealthy countries get it less because they're fucking, they're in better shape.

Speaker 7:          00:39:58       So you, what you think is at HIV is something that can be avoided.

Speaker 6:          00:40:03       I think it, it, I think the likelihood of getting it as increased when your system is worn down and you're malnourished and uh, you know, you don't have enough fluids in you then you tear and that's where the, uh, you, you have more cuts around you because your, your skin, everything is just not as elastic

Speaker 7:          00:40:20       frog. And that's all coming from sex. That it's just completely sexually transmitted. Yeah. You put a penis and a vagina and you rub it back and forth and something tears and then the semen gets in there. Boom. HIV. Remember when you were a kid, you thought everybody would be dead of AIDS by now. I now we were convinced we caught the wave. We got fucked. Who got scared? Remember you get, do you ever remember what uh, happened the first time we took an aids test? Yes. Did you panic? Yeah, I fuck and panic because it's like a 24 hour wait a fucking bannock man. I fucking had panicked or thought about some weird drunk nights on the road as a 20 year old, 21 year old. Come on man. I had to, I caught gonorrhea once. I crossed the chlamydia green. When you pa like his ass, it hurts.

Speaker 7:          00:41:12       It hurts worse than any and you're fighting your need to urinate all bladder. But every ounce to comes out you are ready to fall on the floor screaming. Wow. Yeah, it's nice. And then one shot in the ass did dawn is the syphilis outbreak in porn. Really? Some dude got syphilis and then like didn't show his full medicals, didn't show, he fakes the shot. He took a shot and he thought he was clean 10 days. That's his story. And apparently 11 days. He didn't even, we waited one day and then the next day he did a movie and gave people syphilis cause it's dominoes. She then have sex before. I mean he didn't even, I mean you didn't even get another check. It didn't even get another blood test to see if it's still in the system. He didn't even, he just said I got to work. Well because you don't have to it. My friend is the head of the uh, the um,

Speaker 3:          00:42:08       a venereal disease department of the Health Service for California. His whole thing is trying to get, I mean he knows as much about porn is I do because that's his whole thing is like, you know, when they started using condoms, that was him and he said that the testing, once a month you get tested, which means that gestation period for HIV is like 20 days or whatever. Right. So you're never really catching it. And that there's one agency that does the testing for all the porn movies and it's not even a medical office. It's not, it's not a doctor. The clinic. Yeah. But they closed all these play places down there. They're all forced to go to one place now where it used to be really convenient that like you should be able to go to any doctor, get a test, get all the tasks because it's all the blood sent to the same places as these labs, but they're not letting them do that anymore. So now they're all forced to go to this one sketchy plays and, and so there's all these creepy people at hangout. They, you're trying to fuck with them and stuff like that. And it's, yeah, and it's also they have to pay for it. The actors pay for the test themselves. What fucking job that you go to that right? I mean, first of all, it's a law. You have to give tests it to work. If it's a law, why the fuck are they paying for it?

Speaker 7:          00:43:19       Yeah. That is a business that didn't get a bailout, that business crumbled. I mean there's God's still making money. There's like the very clever computer guys. But you think about like the business of pornography and how many people watch pornography. And then the fact that all of a sudden no one was paying for it anymore, like all of a sudden it all just went away and it's gotten bigger and porn is everywhere. Yeah, it's everywhere in the Mitt. Romney gets an off. What do you say? Number one profit tier from pornography? Yes. Who It is? Mitt Romney? Nope. Close. It's another Mormon. Really? Oh, the Marriott family. They own more hotel chains that sell porn and that's the only place people are paying for anyway. They're the number one profit or from pornography. Squeaky clean Mormon people do pay for it still. Allegedly. I should say that so I don't get that.

Speaker 7:          00:44:10       They're squeaky clean. No, no. They fit. They're the number one. I think they may well if they're not number one there, they made a fuck load of, I would say motel six with me. Number one. I think they own it. I think Marriott owns a lot of this chain auger still sturdy pornographers to Marriott's. Isn't that crazy? When was she found out? They made like millions a year from pornography as businessmen in the road weeping at the end of the bed. Lisa, the expense account, I don't have to, that's why they do it so much. It's all in the expensive. They don't question you for those $40 movies. Hey don't mark them anymore. They don't mark anything. They don't give you a title on the bill. Just moving horse. Yeah. They can't give you a title in the bill that they had to know a long time ago. That was a must. When you block porn, cause I'm assuming you don't anymore. What was your thing? What section? Real and shopping. I didn't ever have a thing. Never really got like too specific. It's uh, you know the thing about porn is this different, you know, you want to see different people, you know, you know, even if one girl is really pretty, you get bored.

Speaker 5:          00:45:17       I got, I started off girl girl only. Like I didn't even want any grades.

Speaker 7:          00:45:21       Picture Brian's like, let me just pretend that we're all on a slumber party and I'm going to be your best B f f ever.

Speaker 5:          00:45:28       Well, it's just something I didn't see every day. Like I have had sex, but like I never saw two girls together. Right. Shit was like aliens to me. Yeah. It's, it's strange.

Speaker 8:          00:45:39       Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:45:39       Um, but they look happy. Usually. I just like to see a dream crushed and Mike Clip, I need a dream crusher. A casting couch or oh, those are the best. Those are hilarious. Or the, the was it was it bang bus that used to have you guys pull over and people would just fuck get it in the car. We got a porno star. Holy Shit.

Speaker 5:          00:45:59       Now my favorite, now it's fucking machine.

Speaker 7:          00:46:02       Wasn't that kid the kid that was in some, what was it? What movie was that?

Speaker 8:          00:46:07       Okay.

Speaker 7:          00:46:07       The kid that had done a porn when he was young, he did like a bang brothers.

Speaker 5:          00:46:11       Oh, Jonathan. Yes. Yeah. From project tax. Yeah. Yeah. What was his story again? Uh, he just, he did a, uh, I think it was a bang bus. How old was he? I think he'd be just turned 18 or something like that. He's a John. Johnathan came and think it was written it last name right now, but he was in that movie project acts and he's like a big Chubby, nerdy kid with glasses and he was in a movie where he fucked, I think it was his first time too, like four girls in a bus. And He, the funny part was though is that it really for girls, I think it was and the funny thing was is that he had like a huge hog. So it's just like, it was like so weird that like I actually knew him before, like, like we had them on, I had him on a few podcasts, like I didn't know about it and such. I think knowing a guy and then finding out you this in porn and then seeing is he his hog that happened with me with a, you know, seven racks from MTV.

Speaker 7:          00:47:08       He was like one of the original VJ then. Yeah, it doesn't, he has another name now. He has a band now. Yeah, exactly. And He's good. He's fucking good. Yeah. Good. But on my podcast, is that what, what song? the 80s is that what it is? And I can't remember about the eighties fuck no, I'm going to go crazy. We'll drop into the podcast

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       later. But um, yeah, but he did some kind of, he just masturbating. But I think it was a big hit with the, with the men gentlemen

Speaker 7:          00:47:37       came out like after he was famous. No, I'm going crazy trying to remember this fucking song. You so crazy. Shut the fuck up. What's wrong with you today? You've got to stop doing ecstasy so much. Breaking your brain, man. Holy Brain. What's the fuck machine? Cheesy

Speaker 5:          00:47:52       brain fog machine is a, it's the called the fucking machines.com I think it is. And it's actually robots that Oh fuck. Really high powered. Like, like you know like Oh cool. Shoot in and out of them like 80 miles per hour and they can't control it. Like they're tied down. So like there's somebody sitting there going, yeah, I'm going to fuck you hard. And like, it's really crazy. Like Dana, dear mom did it and it seems like

Speaker 7:          00:48:17       break your pussy. Yeah, that's a good way to get your pussy all broken. So machine robot metal deck, but just fucking stabbing, you know. Well what if, what if it goes a little too hard? I know. Let's run with it

Speaker 5:          00:48:30       or where you hold the other end. Is it that much of a Chore Machine? Fuck you. You gotta be real careful about that kind of shit. Shit. And what's crazy is that that people on those web cam sites are now doing it because they have like these, I guess you can easily buy him now for your home. Like, like a portable one that's just like, or they may come from like a hardware store, but like there's this one girl that she's just so it's like getting up, like the Dodo is like, I don't know, 12 inches maybe like a huge dildo. And she was giving a blowjob to it, put it on full blast or you can just see it like her, her throat get bigger, like a snake eating a watermelon and it, and it's, it was like you're gonna hurt yourself. You're going to break something, you're going to choke and or you're going to crack your neck open. So crazy. And what's weird is that

Speaker 4:          00:49:17       what is like the, with the algorithm in your brain that wants, like when you talk about different, like I used to love Asian chicks, got another feet. I was never like, I'd let me suck your feet and your call, but I appreciate a nice pair of feet, especially on an Asian woman. Let's just put that out there. So then, then I move on to the cast and catch and I start to wonder on a deeper level, what is it about my personality or my brainwaves that attracts me to a specific thing. And then what is it that has so broken down the social order that people respond to machines. Fucking, it's like the flesh, the softness, the humanity has been stripped away and all that's left is the violent part of fucking

Speaker 7:          00:49:58       do. Have you heard of this new, um, this discovery at Harvard, they've created a cyborg flesh of course at Harvard because nobody can get later, right? Yeah, exactly. I mean, but along those lines like this is like literally step one until you, you create a robot that's going to fuck you up. Amit. Robot. This is nuts, man. Fuck the flying jet. This is pretty intense shit. It's to create the Cyborg flesh. You start with a three dimensional scaffold that encourages

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       cells to grow around them. These scaffolds are generally made of Collagen, which makes up the connective tissue and almost every animal. The Harvard engineer's basically took normal collagen and wove nano wires and transistors into the matrix to create a nano electric scaffold. The neurons, heart cells, muscles and blood vessels within grown as normal, creating cyborg tissue with a built in sensor network. Is this the plot of a porn movie or this is reality. This is reality, man. This is crazy shit. This is like Cyborg flesh. Like they're figuring out a way to replace your skin with robot skin. I'm going to see you in 20 years from now and you're going to be a 24 year old, handsome man, Asian. They're going to take your whole body and slowly replace your skin with some fucking robots. Can. I'm going to have to get used to young Greg. It's going to be weird. What about the hair? Talk to me about the air. Get your fuck. Even if I could grow my hair, I'd go back to shaving it and it was freeing feeling. Just rub it through. But it will stop you from getting a certain type of exam. Hard life. They're there. They've created and court officials. No, no, no. I'm saying this is step one to be a robot. You know, that is your sex slave.

Speaker 3:          00:51:50       Well, that's why, you know, it's all male scientists and the women, they're like Israel trying to fucking defunk uh, Iran's nuclear program. They're coming in at night exposing all this tests. Totally, totally, totally throwing, fucking painted them and shit. You're never going to get their fake pussy fucking white laboratory on fire while they sleep. Yet he finally think they've got, when she comes out and they design it like a garbage, it's spells of the pussy just fucking devours that little Dick, that little Harvard Dick. You're so funny though. Sexual Boston to you say that little Harvard tick.

Speaker 1:          00:52:36       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:52:37       You're getting, you're fucking, you're at, you're at your graduation with the count on trying to hide the stump.

Speaker 1:          00:52:42       This, this, this thing is really complicated. I don't think I even understood what I just said, but what would it seems to me is that this is, I mean they're going to be, they can create flesh. They've already figured out how to do that. They can, they figured out a way to create meat in like essentially like a test tube environment they've had, you know, so it's just a matter of time before and the meat is replicated DNA. Is it? Is it green? Understand it. I'm too stupid to answer that question. I guess the big, the big turn is getting it to actually reproduce itself DNA like it does in humans. Exactly. But it seems to me that if they could replicate one aspect of it, if they could figure out how to meat, it's just a matter of time. It's like we went from the model t Ford to the, you know, 2013 corvette.

Speaker 1:          00:53:32       It's like it gets better. It gets better, it gets better, it gets better. It's when they're doing this now, this is what they're doing now. This is going to expand into something else incredibly freaky. This is going to be incredibly, incredibly freaky. This is cyborg tissue. I mean this is, you can make a fucking cylon. Okay. You could make a Cyborg like this is step one. When they look back in history, when life is like Battlestar Galactica fucking for real and we really are fighting off these intelligent robots that we created. This will be the day where people look at this and go, wait, what did, what did they do? What did they make? What did they started with this? And then goes from this to what? And by the time they tell you about this, how far are they along on this? There'll be the ones telling you about it. Yeah. Clones. Clones will be telling you about cloning. We, well we figured out how to clone this just cause it guy is clone who's telling you about it.

Speaker 4:          00:54:27       Yeah. And, and the amazing thing is that you look at, like I went to the Santa Monica promenade the other day and they come out of the five story parking garage with a line of cars at two different stations. No human being like you're literally collecting between five and $10 every 15 seconds all day and night. You can't pay 12 bucks an hour to some fucking guy to have a job. And that's what's happened is that they talk about unemployment is his dad. You know, the unemployment rate is high. Well, it's not just high because the economy's not doing good. It's they're slicing jobs with machines everywhere. Just to stay at. Even with the job rate, you would have to be creating x number of jobs every month and with these cyborgs, what the fuck? Who's, who's going to have a job anymore?

Speaker 1:          00:55:16       Yeah. Who's going to have any sort of a manual labor job? I welcome the side work friends. I think I rather enjoy paying a machine and talking to the Hershey garage. The idea, I think it's faster too. So it's, it's more convenient. It's faster. So there's a crop. We are so crazy because here's the problem. They are going to be intelligent. If they're going to be intelligence, they're going to be able to be sentience, which means they're going to have their own will. They can do whatever they would like to do. The first thing they're going to do is make a better one of them. They're going to realize what we did wrong. What was stupid about this? This is shitty. You thought about this like a person would, let's Redo this better. And they'll do that almost instantaneously.

Speaker 4:          00:55:57       That's the big question in all of this, since the 1950s when they started talking about robots and stuff is can there be a [inaudible], can there be that transition from something that's been programmed to something that can control itself?

Speaker 1:          00:56:13       You know, it'd be really horrifying if there never was a cent yet moment, but it acted as if there was one and it just ran around like this meat puppet

Speaker 2:          00:56:23       program. Just fucking gun and holes and people. Yeah cause it didn't know what it was supposed to do.

Speaker 3:          00:56:28       Yeah. You can just throw him in a toilet, pour some water on him, you know, stop. You know like that's like a cell phone. Eight is electronics and my

Speaker 2:          00:56:36       think twice probably have that covered. That whole get wet part. It'll still, they already know how to do that with cell phones. You know there's like some product they dip it. No Shit. Yeah, they dip your cell phone in this product and you can like literally drop in the ocean, pull it out, dry it off and make this thing cell phone. You can bring it in and they do this. Yeah. You send them the cell phone, they take it and soak it in some kind of crazy polymer that doesn't have, I don't know the word polymer. I shouldn't be allowed to say it cause I don't even know what the fuck a polymer is. Whatever. Plastic Shit. How about that? Some awesome, super cool plastic shit. [inaudible] water from getting through to the electronics and somehow or another I don't understand it. That's weird. Yeah, but the, there's demonstrations of it online.

Speaker 2:          00:57:19       I can't remember the name of it, but if you're so curious you will Google it. You just hit your cock in it. Never wear a condom. Yeah. I don't think you'd feel pee as much. Y'all black saying shit like every time you're in the shower with your girl you got a boat or she's like, why is it so? I see this is so weird. It's like you never just beating up on it like the hood of a fucking Chevy, like your deck on fire and stick it in the cake, isn't it? Dan is one of the nicest qualities about those old American muscle cars was those big long, giant hoods. When you wax the car and then it rained and the water beat it up on that thing and you just kind of swipe the water off those fucking cars, man, those were works of

Speaker 3:          00:58:05       art. I get to show you this Mustang I saw today. I was over in Burbank before Burbank. Nupur everywhere. Wherever CBS Radford is. That's Burbank, isn't it? Parking garage, studio city. And uh, there was this, don't be a hater. Don't be starting gang violence. Check this out. Feel some kind of special cat. It said like California. What is it? California additional what? What he's showing me look like a 68 Mustang. But it had these, uh, maybe you'll recognize it. I'd never seen him. It's hilarious to me how a guy like you, it doesn't have some fucking crazy car like this. It's Todd. You're already convinced me head writer job on it. What's that? I said this is an old one that looks like a 67 maybe. I don't know that it's got scopes on the side by the doors. The lines of those cars were just so beautiful and it was a three 50 like special edition. It sat on the side. But no, I'm up for a head writer job. It's why I was just over there. And if I get it, I'm pulling the trigger cause I'll be commuting to fucking CBS Radford from Venice. I think I'm gonna get the challenger to get by. It's a lot of gas, gas, but feel like a fucking

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       man when you get in there. The rumble of the engine.

Speaker 3:          00:59:27       I rented a Mustang in Ohio, my wife in the back and not like, yeah, he rented a Mustang and didn't like 2012 convertible Mustang. It was just, you were just telling me about. I have one, I love it. Yeah. But here's a different style. I think.

Speaker 2:          00:59:39       Well I have the, the, it's a different, what's different experiences? The GT 500 it's 550 horsepower. So aluminum block engine and the Ford gt engine put into this wobbly as convertible body. It's beautiful. It's so much fun. It's the most American Dick hard car I've ever driven. Okay. I wouldn't want to drink black. I wouldn't want to drive it every day, but when I drive it, it's fun. It's fuck, it's just, I don't even think about playing anything except seventies rock in that car because it's just got that as a rumble. The VI Lenon scanned it all the way. I got it on a big Leonard Skinner kick when I bought this car cause I'm like, this is the kind of music you need to be listening to.

Speaker 3:          01:00:16       Simple man is perhaps the most moving rock song father telling his son

Speaker 2:          01:00:23       how to be a man's fucking great on the battle of the ballot of Curtis Lowe. Yeah. Yeah. They had, they had some classic shit, so fucking underrated. But there's something about dudes that guys can, for whatever stupid reason, like really viscerally connect with the sound of an engine of a car and you know that kind of like, you know, 1970s in 19 late 1960s classic rock, they ball together into one really like guy centric experience and I dunno what the fuck it is. It's really weird. Like I've tried to assess my love for the rumble of an engine before, like why it's so retarded with me. Like I get it like a shriek, like a little child when I hear a good engine whale. Like I just fucking love it. It just sounds awesome, but it's stupid. It's so stupid. Like wouldn't it be better if it was completely silent? Like that's what I don't like about the Prius that it's totally side. But wouldn't that be awesome? You know, it was for one thing and this fucking stupid life to not just make a shit load of noise everywhere it goes. Wouldn't that be awesome?

Speaker 3:          01:01:28       You know what, give me a Prius that has a fake sound when I the, it just plays on the inside of the car.

Speaker 2:          01:01:34       Well do you know the, they have a BMW that does that. It, the BMW m five has the sound of the engine transmitted through the speakers. It's really kind of a cheesy move but it's, and it's an automatic double clutch. It's an automatic, but the best way to drive it is to use the paddles. You know like when they like tracking down the track. It's a, it's an amazing car. I mean it's not, there's nothing bad about the car, it's just the decision to like make the sound come through the stereo. It seems like cheating. Like it sounds like what it sounds like they had to make it a, a, a turbo because um, there's all these new crazy gas efficiency laws that are coming out and it's really hard to make a the same like gas guzzler type engines. By the time I think it's 2016

Speaker 1:          01:02:21       I believe it is, every car is going to have to be above 35 miles account. That's going to be the industry standard. So like all these cars, like these mustangs and shit, you won't be able to buy them just in a few years from now. You can't get anything retarded in a few years. Yeah. Because like it, and by the way, the, the, the Shelby, the Gt 500, somehow or another, it doesn't even get a gas guzzler tax, you know, I don't, I don't know how that is huge. It's a huge VA, but they figured out something, make it really efficient. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:02:51       You were saying that, what was the, the car you can bring on a track that got better mileage than a Prius,

Speaker 1:          01:02:56       uh, be a BMW m three. Yeah. When you bring a Prius on to attract top gear, did this, they, they took a Prius and they made it go full blast around a race track and all the BMW had to do was keep up with it and the BMW kept up with it easily and got better gas mileage than the Prius did. Hmm. Because the Prius was fighting for its fucking life or as the BMW was just like sprinting.

Speaker 3:          01:03:18       Well. Yeah, but I think the Prius is designed to save you money. Stop and go through town. It's not not, not for highway.

Speaker 1:          01:03:24       Yeah. That's the whole point of the brakes generating extra power, right? Yeah. The breaks help

Speaker 3:          01:03:29       and it's got it down to, mine's got to down shift thing now, so you actually collect even more it, it'll decelerate the way if you downshifted wood and collect that energy when you're going to pull the trigger. As soon as I get this job, I'm going to find out in the next week. Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:03:43       Women will never understand these conversations, but we'll never understand fucking handbags. Do you ever get a handbag conversation with Mrs Fitzsimmons?

Speaker 3:          01:03:51       Not like that at all. Oh God. We just went to a big wedding and she borrowed handbags. Jewelry. I felt like such a dude dress. I'm like, book go shit. She shopped for two fucking weeks and didn't find anything. I go into a store and it's very simple. I need a shirt. I'm going to this store. I'm walking out with his shirt. That's all it takes. Pants, this store walk, Christmas shopping, got to buy some for the wife, this store coming out with something. She spent two weeks going in and out and did not find any. That boggles my fucking mind. She had the best affairs ever. No one has got no class. It's keeps on leaving. I know all these guys. Warmth, warmth, the way your wife shooting. She found a friend that had addressed though that. Yup. That's weird. That's hilarious. So what does your wife usually wear?

Speaker 3:          01:04:49       Like lumberjack shit. Like, yeah, she's into flannel Timberland's she's got a hay hay in her hair now. She does. She works like she's got big tits so she'll wear 34 days and tight jeans. Not Tight, tight, but you know, she's got a good fucking body man. I swear to God. I had sex with her the other day and I was just like, fuck God damn it. Your body's nice. You know, I check her out all the times. And uh, she, she initiated, it was fucking night milky. She initiated, he's given us full details. I mean in, you know, in the living room and walked in. Music wanted it. Okay. And the music player now what was on TV? I was like something like seeing how it was on my laptop, on the chair in the living room and she fucking lap dance. We would know music and then we threw down on the couch and uh, and then she just walked away, kept on doing her shit.

Speaker 3:          01:05:45       It's Tuck it. Would it be funny if Greg and his wife didn't really have sex at all anymore but he liked, could written all these stories but it gets a crossed up and he doesn't realize he told us this one already, but it was a little different before it was on the couch. He said the same thing about her walking away. You imagine catching someone in a crazy lie, the best marriage ever and just find out, oh death. That was the saddest. I saw a little bit of this movie with Kevin. Kevin James. It's a fucking good actor. Good Act. I mean, I, my kids watch when all these movies, and not only does he do physical comedy, but his face can do so much shit. Even in drama. He's a powerful dude. His, um, here comes the boom moving, here comes the boom, movie's coming out in October.

Speaker 3:          01:06:31       And that's a movie where he, uh, plays a MMA fighter. He plays a guy, was a college wrestler. He's fucking great in it, man. He can, he can act and he can take those silly high concept movies like that and actually grounded enough to make it funny. But this movie, anyway, he's, he's about to, uh, his friends get to propose and he's telling me how great marriages, he's trying to drag them anyway. And then the guy sees his wife cheating, calls are on it. And she goes, well, what do you, what do you know about our marriage? He goes and gets a fucking hand job from a Thai girl every Friday, and it all falls apart. You know? And this guy wants to get married, but he realizes that every married person is spinning another fucking story about their marriage. And to me it's like you either stay married, like getting divorced.

Speaker 3:          01:07:17       You should never do until you need a divorce, then you should get a fucking divorce. But to live a lie in a marriage, why not kill? You're not alive if you're doing that. Yeah. Some people just can't change. They have a real hard time just moving on to the next thing. We'd have a really hard time just changing. It's very difficult for some people. That's one of the things in this happy movie, it talks about how the pain, the thing that you think is gonna be losing your job, going, bro, even getting kicked out of your house, it's not as bad as you think it's going to be. And the fear of it happening controls so much of your actions. It goes away right away. You experience it and you're in a new reality. All of a sudden I got no house. I found another place. My life moving forward. Uh, you keep on getting out of sync with us for some reason. You're a camera. And so I'm trying to fix it flashed. I noticed that it flashed. Yeah. Well, I'm trying to fix it right now, but long was the audio is on. I'm going to be, I'll be a man of mystery, but it was weird. It's like me and Greg would be talking and then you would answer like five seconds

Speaker 7:          01:08:16       on delay. So it was like me and you were in a different world. Didn't show this really trippy to watch. I've been, I fixed it once before then it started happening again. Yeah. You think it's because of switching this laptop? Yeah, probably switched to Windows. Yeah. We tried to do the podcast at windows. The iTunes version will be good. Ladies and gentlemen, go get that audio version. And as far as the video, uh, we gave it a shot. Uh, wait, what is it? We were broadcasting for the first time today. It looks like it's, yeah, I fixed it. I fixed it last time it started happening again. This is the first time we're broadcasting the video portion of it off of a windows computer when you've done them before. Why? Because we have one, we have this Alienware computer that gave it to us. So we figured, well, let's try it.

Speaker 7:          01:08:57       Let's try it this way. Normally you do it a different way. Normally we do it through a Mac and I mix it up, points in our head. We decided, uh, we decided to see what would happen and apparently there's some issues I want to with the, that's a fixable thing. It's probably the power of the laptop trying to handle three, uh, uh, webcams at the same time. So I'm guessing you get a weak ass bitch. Well, we went from an Imac, which is topical line two, three, three webcams or taken it down. But that's a gaming laptop. Those things or they have super power when it comes slowly. Fix Cards. Yeah, but wouldn't that have anything to do with the information coming out of CPU? I mean, you're doing three webcams. I don't know. And it's the power of powering and here's why it's the wrong one. You know, I should have brought that big giant one in. We should have tried it with that one because that one is much more powerful than you think. That would be a good drive. Yeah. That's a lot of shit, but there their computer sort of, we're trying to do this. Technically we're a mess

Speaker 6:          01:09:57       trying to do a two camera thing. Backstab I'm doing a one hour special on, we're shooting backstage with multi cameras and trying to stream it live before I go on and uh, the directors all on top of that shit. And I was just like, you know why

Speaker 7:          01:10:11       you begin to be doing in the stream?

Speaker 6:          01:10:14       Just um, you know, I'm backstage, my, my two best friends that I grew up at, two biggest fucking troublemakers because I'm shooting it in Tarrytown, New York and these guys, I can't even get into what they fucking did cause one of them is the town judge, the other guys, the fire chief is a fucked up these towns are at. So, uh, so the special is going to be me. They're pulling up somehow illegally getting firetruck and pulling me up to the front of the theater on a firetruck and then at the end they're leading me out and putting me into a police cruiser and a tear it down. So I want to have all my buddies back page that I used to fuck around with growing up. All the troublemakers and just right up until they announced my name and go on stage. I just want to be fucking around and laughing.

Speaker 7:          01:10:56       That's a great idea. That'll get your really warmed up. Sort of like a, when we do the Ice House to the podcast we do right before we can show exactly. Same sort of thing. Probably inspired me to do it actually. It's a great move a think about it. Those are the guys that put you in the frame of mind, you know that made you a comedian the first place.

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       Yeah. You get into the rhythm of making them laugh and do that to the audience. That is a, when you get a group of guys and a couple of them were funny, it can get pretty fucking crazy. Yeah. If you get a group of guys and a couple of them were funny. Well cause then you got the guys that they're laugh keeps, keeps it going. Then he got the guy you're all shitting on. Yup. And you all know the dynamic. It's like a gift. It's like a beetle. You got four guys and they all have a role. Exactly. It's hilarious. Who is your, who is your guys growing up? Uh, well,

Speaker 1:          01:11:44       my two best friends when I was growing up were two Jimmys and they were both a a year ahead of me. So they, they were graduating and they were both a tradesman one. Jimmy's a carpenter and when Jimmy is an electrician, just real normal guys. And I lived with a one, Jimmy. Jimmy did Teleo great fucking guy to this day. I talked to him every now and then. I really don't get to see him that often. I saw him when I was in Boston when it was there for the UFC. Him and my other friend Jimmy, Jimmy lawless.

Speaker 3:          01:12:11       Hey Sal. Both of them together. Yeah. Yeah. We hung out and then they brought their kids. It's crazy. You know, Jimmy Lawless brought his kid. It's just, it's so weird. In Israel. Name is lawless. Yeah, that's, he's a great guy too. He's, he's been my buddy since we were like 15 as it just like, like all times.

Speaker 1:          01:12:31       Oh yeah. He's just a great guy. Well you know the, the thing that I've always said about that life, the living that life in Boston, it's a hard life to live in that whether it's a, it's a hard, it's a hard place to grow up too because people in Boston have like extreme blue collar work ethic too. There's like a lot of that up there too. There's a lot of people that like when I was in high school I felt so lazy cause I knew like 10 dudes that had landscaping jobs, they had their own like, like series of launch. They would cotton and they were hiring people and this, I remember this kid was driving a brand new car when we were in high school. Like what the fuck? He always had money. This kid is incredible. He just figured it out. I felt like such a lazy asshole because this kid had figured out how to move and hustle. Like there was so much of that and I grew up in Newton and Newton upper falls. There was so much of that there.

Speaker 3:          01:13:22       But Newton is kind of right and wrong side of the tracks isn't it?

Speaker 1:          01:13:25       Well, my side of the tracks was just, we just lived in a really cheap house in a pretty decent neighborhood. I mean it was a cute little neighborhood, but the houses a piece of shit and my parents bought the house so that we could be in the neighborhood so that get us into a good school system because we were in Jamaica plain before that, which was like really shade

Speaker 3:          01:13:45       the area. Where else? Hey, make me a fucking Sally's down. Jp.

Speaker 1:          01:13:50       Jp was shady. I saw some crazy shit live in there and just a couple of years it was a, that was a tricky place. But you know, no, nothing compared to like real bad and it's not Compton or anything like that. But

Speaker 3:          01:14:01       there was that whole like Italian, Irish, like you had JP, you had uh, uh, not Dorchester, but um, uh, west Roxbury,

Speaker 6:          01:14:12       not Roxbury, but west Roxbury right next to JP. And it was like you weren't in Dorchester but you could get your drugs there and you know, there was, there was like people that had got just enough money to get out of the really shitty neighborhoods, made it out to like Jane.

Speaker 1:          01:14:25       Yeah. We would go into Dorchester and late at night and buy food at places. And I remember we were at this place, they were serving like steak and cheese sandwiches and uh, it was open really late at night and this neighborhood was fucked up. This is like, it was like you were scared to expose your money before you paid for it because you thought someone would just snatch it from you. Yeah. Like there was just some, some wild, crazy people there. And they had this thick plexiglass between the, the server in you and they only served you through like the slot. And uh, they gave the guy the sandwich and then the guy says, that'll be, you know, x amount of money and the guys just start screaming hardy page or you motherfucker, you're trying to cheat me, you motherfucker. And they were like, I can't let it go.

Speaker 1:          01:15:09       Let it go, let them go, let them go. Just let them go. Just let them go and they just let this guy creep out on there and just hoping that he didn't just blast them, hoping that you didn't catch a man on his last day. You know, because you can, if you, you know, especially if you live in a big city, we fucking, I guess you can get anywhere if you just run into someone on their last straw, like that guy just run into that guy and they were like half of the sandwich. Thanks. Take it easy.

Speaker 6:          01:15:35       That's where you got to have instincts. You know, you can take anybody in a city, you know, you take somebody who's not from a city and you put them in a city, they don't have that instinct. Don't let him go walk away or challenge. There's times where it's just a safe to challenge.

Speaker 1:          01:15:47       Yeah. Sometimes with, sometimes people talk too much and they get themselves in trouble and they don't know what a real fist fight is. Like. They don't know what a real, there's no rules out there. Okay. That guy could stab you. Like you don't even know this guy. He might be from some other country where you know they'll stab people on the regular. I mean, he might fucking shoot you. You don't know what you're doing. Why are you fighting people? Like if you could avoid it at all costs, avoid it. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:16:12       Paul can be a subtle thing too. Like when I, you know, walking through New York City all those years, if I'd be fucking lower east side late at night, three black guys come from the other direction. Not to be racist, but the fucking reality is three black guys walking past me in a bad neighborhood. You fucking cross the street. That's dangerous. You've got to walk right at them. You can't make eye contact, but you don't look away. There's a subtle way that people know how to live in cities and if you, if you fucked that up, you become a victim. Like exponentially more. Yes, absolutely. That's what I mean by challenge. Yeah, I know what you mean by that. Yeah, I agree with that. Definitely. What I'm, it was like people start unnecessary altercations. I run, I just take off, let's turn around. I see a black guy had a cycle, probably could outrun a black guy. God was that racist? What I just said? No,

Speaker 1:          01:17:02       no, because you're, you're just admitting that white people are scared of black people.

Speaker 6:          01:17:07       Yeah. I'm more of black people and white people.

Speaker 3:          01:17:11       I can tell you, I mean, if you want to be fucking totally rip myself open, to be honest. Yeah, I am.

Speaker 7:          01:17:16       I'm not, uh, I think, uh, physically more black people can kick my ass, but I think there's more white serial killer. So interesting.

Speaker 3:          01:17:26       You're yelling, you're going cereal. I'm with Greg. I think a white people are just as creepy. You're crazy. I think my fear comes from what I look like. I think that as a white guy who's not big with a receding hairline, I think I look like somebody that you could fuck with more. And I think especially for black people, I look and that, and it may, and it's not true, but in my head, in my fucked up view of things, I think that they're seeing me that way. I'm putting that on them. That's good. Get you in trouble, man. I got robbed by a black guy, so I immediately think that you never got robbed by a white guy. I'm a white guy. I mean I'm, I've only, they robbed once. So hopefully in the future it's a white person and an Asian person than a Mexican. So you have a phone, multi racial profile of people who have offended. You don't even put that out there, man. I'm just to come back to you like the secret and he's gonna start having hanging around China town late at night so it gets robbed there. Drunk pants down. What am I going? I don't know. I keep forgetting.

Speaker 3:          01:18:31       Can you give me directions? Totally lost here. I'll give you money.

Speaker 7:          01:18:37       How many dudes are out there doing that right now? How many dudes are out there? Just fake drunk and Chinatown. Yeah. Wow. I'm so drunk. I might just do anything right now pretending to pass out after to let the guy fuck them.

Speaker 3:          01:18:53       A cop comes over and sees it and you want to report this? Nah, Nah, I'm good.

Speaker 7:          01:18:58       Let it go. How many times do you think cops interrupt blow jobs on a given night in Los Angeles?

Speaker 3:          01:19:05       It's amazing cause they don't even hide. I mean you see, you see prostitutes just bobbing up and down. I wouldn't say it prostitutes. I was saying someone just being someone just getting crazy in the car. If you, have you ever seen people do that? Oh fuck. I saw a girl given head while driving down Pacific in Venice, driving home from dinner with my wife and were at a red light and I point to my wife and that dude is driving an SUV and all you see is this head and they're higher than us. I can only see the top of the head bobbing up and down. And I look at the guy and he looks at me and I'm expecting a fucking a thumbs up. Nothing just looks at me. Look straight ahead, heads Bob. And, and to this day, keep his boner. This was five or six years ago to this date. Every time we're driving down Pacific at that spot, I go, I remember the time you got check. Yes. I fucking who's probably scared that you were going to try to honk and ruin his blowjob, who's panicking? Felt the conflict, the IDI conflict. It was losing his edge.

Speaker 7:          01:19:58       That's what the porn star saying when they start to lose it

Speaker 3:          01:20:01       is there edge, I wonder what that guy did at dinner. Cause like if I'm, if I'm on fire dinner, you know, I put the on my head, I'm getting laughs,

Speaker 6:          01:20:08       whatever. Then I'm driving home. She might hold my hand and I get some sense that there's going to be action. But how good was he had dinner that she fucking started bobbing up and down on them?

Speaker 2:          01:20:18       I don't even think it was Dennis. The one that I saw. I saw I was in the middle of the day. It was oddly enough with Kevin James that we're bringing real life and uh, and he was right beside us and, and Kevin spot it at first. And uh, I was like, Holy Shit. And Kevin was going to hit, hit the horn and I talked about it in though. He was just joking, but the guy saw us and gave us a thumbs up. That's guy. The guy saw us and went like this.

Speaker 6:          01:20:46       Yeah. You pointed to it and it was pretty funny. That was my closing pit. Remember? For fucking years, it was like a ladies, you've never seen this before, but here's what we do when he gives a blow job and then I just start pumping my fists in the air and doing that. I closed. I was so embarrassed. Fitzsimmons killed man at fucking killed. Wow. Do you ever go back and think about some of the shit that you said when you were on stage? You Go Wapo well, you know Jim Florentine just put out a CD called my first notebook and it's shit that he was so embarrassed. He used to do, we found an old notebook and you went out and he did all of it in a club. He's putting down on a CD and he's promoting, you're going like, I don't know why anybody would buy this. This is,

Speaker 2:          01:21:28       that's brilliant. Oh, that's hilarious. That is done. Well, that's not brilliant for everybody. A lot of people go to all these fuck a material blows. But for a guy like me, it's brilliant.

Speaker 6:          01:21:39       Well, I think it's, it's interesting. It would be interesting to people in the same way that like, you know, you hear the, the like Bruce Springsteen, there's these tapes, they're just called them the tapes, the album. And it was when he auditioned, the first time he drove in from New Jersey and a fucking broken down Pinto brought his acoustic guitar and started playing, uh, Mary Queen of Arkansas and all these amazing fucking songs, acoustic with different chord structures, different pitches. And it's like, it's fucking, it's not as good, but you're riveted because you're like, wow, this is, this is the fucking sketch that led to this masterpiece. So I mean, not that that would be the equivalent with standup, but I think it would be interesting for people to hear maybe the, what was the roots of a set they already know rather than just a bunch of shit you never did again.

Speaker 2:          01:22:24       Yeah, for sure. Yeah. If they could hear it like after the fact, like this is what didn't make the cut. This is how the bid evolves. The problem is when those intermediate steps get online. Yeah. You know, when you know they get ready to get on the youtube clip or something like that or you know, you see it and go, oh but that's not even, that's like the beginning of it. It's like it's just growing. Like they're always, they're always growing up to a certain point. But there's that really fragile time for a bit. When you're first doing the first few times you're doing it on stage and not if one of those got online, you'd be like, yeah, that's, that's a steal.

Speaker 6:          01:23:00       Well, cause a lot of times you're talking around the joke, you haven't figured out the bare construction of it and you're describing the joke. Did it later will become,

Speaker 1:          01:23:09       yeah. That's a very good way of putting it. And, but I think when a lot of people don't know that are watching standup comedy is that while you're doing it, you know, you, you're, you're barely even thinking about what you're doing. You're almost like writing it. You're almost like when you really lock it in, you know that feeling you get when you're really killing. Yeah. You're in the flow. You don't even feel like you're a part of it. Like you're witnessing it all happen. That's exactly what I'm talking about. The happy thing that that's the flow. Yeah, well that's what, you know, the whole, the idea of being in the moment, completely zen and locked into how the universe is expressing itself through, through whatever the fuck is going on through either stand up comedy or through music or through to car racing. Whenever the fuck it is, man. It's just that, that, that moment when it all works out, you know,

Speaker 6:          01:24:01       and you come off stage, there's nights you come offstage exhausted. Those nights you come off with twice the energy is when you went on. It's like you just soaked in all this energy and you just fucking ride. It can last a full day where you're just buzzing still.

Speaker 1:          01:24:16       Yeah. It's a, it's a weird Gig, you know. And the weird thing about a uni is that we've known each other since we first started. You know, there's not that many guys from our little group is you, me Maguire, Tom Cotter, Tom Cotter, three finalists. America's got talent. Powerful. Tom cotter. Good luck to you buddy. Um, I mean there's, there's, you know, not that many guys from that, that small group of open Miker is that we were in that like the, the, you know, you think of open mycosis like classes. Like this is the class of 1988. There's a class in 1989 and we were the 88 guys. Yeah. You know,

Speaker 6:          01:24:52       and it was an every couple of years it was a very different brand of comedy that would come out. Not very different, but enough that you could detect it.

Speaker 1:          01:24:59       Yeah. There was challenges and trends. And what was that Kid's name? Who was a, uh, no, no, no. The guy who was a irregular at the, um, at Nick's comedy stop. He was sorta like Nick Depaulo, but oh, um, he became like their regular guy. Fuck. He's funny as shit. Funny as shit. He never left Boston. No, I forget his name kills me. He's still a killer too.

Speaker 6:          01:25:34       He is a killer. And that's the thing about Boston is the guys that have figured out the, the sort of formula that works in Boston but are also an original voice. It's just amazing how you can, you can destroy when it's a match of a comic versus a certain locale. Like you take somebody like David Cross and put them in San Francisco, boom, locked in, they're going to go for long rides with him. You go to a, you know, Houston with somebody like a, you know, like what Bill Hicks was. You take a southern and you put them down, blue collar guy. You put them in North Carolina, but you take guys like Nick Depalo or this guy and you put him in Boston and it's just, it's explosive. What happened?

Speaker 2:          01:26:13       It's a match. You don't remember his name. It's driving me fucking crazy. It's really funny guy. But he just stayed, you know, and I'm sure he does. Well like in Boston, Paul Nard Dizzy. That's it. That's it. Beautiful. That's it. And I remember that kid was like the class, I think of 89 I think he came a little bit after [inaudible] 91 maybe 90 yeah cause I was gone by I think 90 to 91 or 92 I was gone. Might've been [inaudible] 90 it might have left at the end of the day. It was 91 91 yeah, definitely. But he was really, really fucking funny. I'm sure he still is. That guy was, he was really good. Yes. So edgy. The Shit don't rip a hole in the million boom. And it was like a hammer attack dude. It was just hammer you over and over again with another one. Here's another splash line. Another punchline. Yeah. That's the rapid fire Boston style. It's like the, the, the crowds in Boston were so hostile that you had to develop this like really energetic, like rapid fire style. You have to be leaning forward. Yeah. Mentally you got to constantly be up. There was no sitting on the stool. Get the fuck off the stool. Yeah. Jesus. Sure. An entertainer.

Speaker 6:          01:27:25       Yeah. There weren't long pauses. I mean, you know, you start working the road and you, you learn the value of a nice go get a sip of water, fucking let them sit. They'll kill you. Not Boston, no way. Stay on the horse. But it's also the, the, you know, I find it a very Irish thing is that um, you don't deserve to feel good or have any pride. And so Boston is about stripping it away from you. So every joke is about, you know, I go to the, you know, I go to the fucking a tall both and the guy, I hand them a 20, he goes, you've got change. No, that's your fucking job. Your job is to make fucking change. I give you a 20 year. It's just like any fucking entitlement is just fucking knock in a cold way. Just knock the Shit Outta you. Yeah. Like immediately. And then there was no dissent.

Speaker 9:          01:28:18       Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:28:21       100% right. There was no, no entertaining and other sides of an issue.

Speaker 2:          01:28:24       Cambridge was an odd sort of a club. Do you remember catch a rising star in Cambridge, right? It's fucking club ever. Maybe Tom was a great club that was run by a site. Then Robin here was, who was quite a character, but he loved comedy.

Speaker 6:          01:28:41       You left a certain type of be hated me, but he came and he called me. He ate, you go in and you audition for the guy you do 10 minutes and then at the end of it he either, he tells you right away he goes, no or yes. And he said, no. And I didn't give a fuck. I've always had very thick skin. I go, well, uh, I'd like, why? And he goes, well, I can either tell you now or we can go on the back and sit

Speaker 7:          01:29:02       down and I can tell you exactly why. I said, yeah, let's go on the back. First words out of his mouth. As far as I'm concerned. You're just another cocky little Irish puke. That was the beginning. Wow. That's fucking racist. He didn't get racist with me, but he said that I am everything that he hates about comedy. He goes, what you do is everything I hate about comedy. Wow. And I said, oh, okay. Well, I just didn't, we don't like the same. And then we have this like weird stare down where he's like, it was a big guy, thick motherfucker. It was a big guy. Like I didn't want to tangle with them. I didn't want to have to scrap with them, but it was a, it was an intimidation moment. It was a, it wasn't a comfortable moment. I didn't like it. It wasn't like this is a smart, friendly guy who should be managing a comedy club and influencing comedians.

Speaker 7:          01:29:55       Everything had this heavy leftists bent to it. Everything had this like Harvard socialize. Yeah. Barry Crimmins would sit at the bar and if he didn't like what you were doing, he would yell shit out at you. Like he was like the dean of the club. They were best friends and I love Barry Crimmins. He's a fucking brilliant, brilliant guy. But back then he was drinking a lot and he and those guys were on a mission to create a place that they thought was fertile for this type of comedy. I was a the catch before ever did stand up with a friend of mine from high school, Diane Derosa, real nice girl and we're just buddies sitting in the club. And your boy Kevin Meeney one on stage. This is before I ever got onstage myself. And this was when Kevin meaning was on fire. Kevin Meaney was a fucking co rusher, do Russia core Russia and you didn't understand what he was talking about.

Speaker 7:          01:30:54       His big pants were a big pants people and you'd be Corizon laugh and it was so ridiculous. And I remember leaving thinking God I knew he was funny cause I'd seen him on TV before but I like five cut five tonight shows that year. Yeah, I I but nothing like seeing them like it's such a completely different experience seeing a guy like that live because he's like the silliness is not that contagious when it comes to the TV. But when you're in front of that dude and he's, he was fucking crush. Hard to describe. I saw him in that same club probably, I don't know if it was the same weekend, that era, but when he came in the place was fucking jammed and he went up there sweating and a bow tie and a jacket. I don't care. And to this day I say when people say who's the best can be, I say, nobody has ever made me laugh as hard in one set as Kevin Maney. Wow, that's a good statement. I stand by it. I believe you. 100% I might, I might. I, it's too far of a distant memory for me to, uh, to say that mine was just as good, but I remember being blown away at how funny it was. It was just so long ago.

Speaker 6:          01:32:02       He's silly and he would sing that song. I don't care. And that was his theme. He did not, he was going to be this ridiculous rip fucking torn kind of a character, rip Taylor, rip torn and rip tail or rip tail. He was, the guy threw confetti and acting crazy. It was like a little bit of an element of that mixed with the guy who really understood standup comedy. He was fucking hilarious. He was in my wedding party, really was one of my officers. Wow. Yeah. I grew up in one town over from him and my dad got him on stage is very first time because my dad was big radio guy in New York. Wow. Kevin was a waiter and waited on my dad and it would be funny and my dad said, you should do stand up. And he was friends with the guy at catch and he got them on stage his first time.

Speaker 2:          01:32:43       I remember when we were open micros. I always thought that was really fucking cool. Like Holy Shit. Fitzsimmons actually knows Kevin Meaney like you actually knew Kevin Meeting. Yeah. And when you have problems or when you were going through things you would ask like Kevin Meeney questions. I remember a several times having conversations where you are dispensing like wisdom that Kevin Meeney told you about standing up and we were talking about it like, okay, yeah. Okay. That makes sense. You know, those early years when you're such an old blind blabbering fucking moron up there and trying to like, you know, it has the seal your way too. Oh, coconut water in the house.

Speaker 6:          01:33:22       Yeah, it was um, you know, it was a time when I really needed a mentor and he wasn't, he wasn't a guy that brought me on the road open and form all the time. It was just more of like you said, I could call him anytime and he hears a guy who was this hot one hour special on HBO. Miss Uncle Buck comes out all the money in the world and I come out to la and stay with them. You bought a Chrysler K card. That's the kind of guy who was fucking business, you know, underneath all the silliness. He was a conservative, simple guy. So who was advice on comedy? I especially respect it because I could see this guy was going the distance. This wasn't a guy. It was hot. It was going to flail out, which you, you know, to this day he's, you know, he's still out there fucking banging it out. That's awesome. Now he's out of the closet and now he's getting know,

Speaker 2:          01:34:06       Bang it out his name. I didn't know that he will. I mean, I wasn't one of those things where I was like, well Duh. You know, I thought, oh,

Speaker 6:          01:34:16       I thought it was straight. I thought he was straight to a lot of people he'd been married to. Right. When you married Roy, give a fuck. What am I the inquired with the kid? No, not only married. He met a woman out in La. Uh, fell in love with her and uh, called me. It was my babysitter who lived next door to me growing up. Whoa. Fucking weird. Is that, whoa. How old was she? She's probably seven, eight years older than me or a Harvard Mba. Real fucking successful type a personality and a, yeah. That my dad had died.

Speaker 2:          01:34:48       Oh, there were a lot to be a fly on that wall. That's my gene Simmons oppression.

Speaker 6:          01:34:54       Really? Is that what he says? Joe Stuck in my innocence

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       to be a fly on that wall. Is he currently ever show? I don't know, man. We were trying to get a campaign. Have him apologize. Bert Kreischer. Bert Kreischer was on the x show with him at Jensen was done, and he said Gene Simmons treated him more horribly than any human being he'd ever met in his life. And Burt said that it was just like demoralize him because he was a huge kiss fan who's a huge kiss fan, who was just literally, and if you know Bert, I look, I've known Burt since I knew I met him back then, but I've been friends with them for a couple of years now. He's just a fun, wild dude. And you, if you misread him, you might go look at this annoying guy, man. I'm trying to relax before my performance man. And so he a, apparently it was like super rude to Burt, which is we can't have, well we can't have that. That's not a surprise. It was any kind of known for being who he is. He's known, but I met him and he was really nice. It also makes me,

Speaker 4:          01:35:57       yeah, but you know what that is. That's the guy who treats different people different ways, different status. People get a different treatment. Well is worse than just being a dude.

Speaker 2:          01:36:05       I wish I could have a personal experience to share other than the positive one. But meeting him was awesome. Then he came to my comedy show, him and his wife and his kid, his kid, uh, got my shiny happy Jihad CD from iTunes and he really liked it. So is this thing fucking up again Brian? And it's just kind of just can't keep up with it. It just kind of wonky. Right. We'll switch it back, we'll switch it. But anyway, he was really cool. His whole family is cool. They came to a new year's at the Improv was fun. But you know when you hear a story like that where someone's like super rude to a guy like Bert and like, oh man, that's so hard to hear. Yeah. Cause every now and then you were here a story. Yeah, man. I met Patrick Swayze one, she was a fucking Douche bag and they're like, was it really? Or what are you really annoying? Which one is it is, it might be that you might be really annoying and somewhere along the line you might've decided that he upset your feelings and how many, I mean, have you ever had like those weird, like people who feel slighted because artificially slided people?

Speaker 4:          01:37:07       Yeah, well they're looking for it because we're storytellers and we all want to go back to our town or back to our friends and go, hey, I met Joe Rogan and they're going to go really? What was he like? And the truth is he said hi to you. You shook his hand, maybe said three words and then somebody else did. Now they got it. They got to fucking pull from that a story for their friends. So if there's a hint of you being dismissive, they're going up, they're going to blow it out because then they've got a connection to you or he was the greatest fucking guy in the world, which I never want to fall into. That can't be it. I mean I'm total, I go hang out after the shows in the world and want to be the guy that I'll take a picture with you, but you know what? Don't put your arm around me while your girlfriend figures out how to snap a photo on your phone for the first fucking time of hugging people. Gregory. I don't get that fellow big hug like this. I don't mind the hug.

Speaker 7:          01:37:55       You know what I like? Is the armpit on my shoulder, my shoulder. Oh, the sweat. It just deal, man. That's what it is. The guys, he's flunking on you and I bet your girl can smell it. I bet it's some sort of a primal thing too. Especially if homeboy, he doesn't know any deodorant. Like if you'd come home and you're around your wife, she probably feels like you got conquered. That's right. What is this a man on you? There's man, you shown her. That's right. Or she doesn't know. She just wants to fuck you. It's just to know why. How weird are primal smells like mean isn't that, doesn't that which puts women on the coinciding menstrual cycle, isn't it an affair mono thing? Is that right? I believe it is. I want to say it is. I might be wrong, but I mean how, how Prime Hill are we?

Speaker 7:          01:38:36       Women get around each other. They're their menstrual cycles all coincide. So if they all get banged, they all raised their kids together so the kids have friends. That's my theory. Isn't there a thing about how your, your, your sperm count raises looking at houses the fuck are you doing, you know, what are you doing? I'm looking to see what the comments are while I'm listening. The comments, your sperm count goes up when you're traveling or something. Of course you're ready to conquer a new land. Yeah. Your body knows it's not around. It's normal smell. And you, your, your, your dick gets hard when you go to pick up your spear. Yeah. Traveling. You're going to war. I'm going to kill and your luck cause we'll be home in three days. How many people are programmed that way? How many people from the life enrollment times we're programmed to kill and fuck, fuck at the same time.

Speaker 7:          01:39:23       So I mean it must be really hard to work that culture out, calm that culture down. I mean we're talking about the amount of violence that we see on a regular basis. Pretty fucking minimal. It can be a pretty horrific in certain places, but in America pretty minimal compared to what it would be like if this was the sword fighting days. Yeah. You know, like on a regular basis people had to deal with some shit that we couldn't even fucking begin to wrap our heads around with. Yeah. It was really about power. It was what can I take and he would do it with swords. It would run into a city with sore to chop everything up and take all the people and take their goal and it fuck all their women. I mean nutty shit happened. And the world, like in nature, you know, you destroy your, you know, if you are competing with somebody for a food source, if you're an insect, you will start to kill the other insect or you will find a way to destroy the food starts for them so that they die.

Speaker 7:          01:40:17       But it's a weird thing of the, when, when people get into tribes, especially where they become really synchronized, like as this tribe, this is, this is us and we're going to go after them and they never even would consider the idea of taking them into their ranks are like, hey listen, we're just going to go plunder. What'd you guys like to come with us? You know, we could, we could be a big army, we could all get together. We'll take them as slaves, but they never take them on as equals. I mean, there was a lot of slave holding back then. I mean, it must conquer it and you fuck the women and you took the dude's and say you're slipped. Yeah. I mean how many people had to live their life like that? I was lot. Right. That was free for how many years did that kind of shit go on in this world?

Speaker 4:          01:40:59       Well, the Old Testament, the whole fucking book talks about slavery like it's not even a sin. It's in actually the seventh commandment is thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, thy neighbor's house, I neighbors donkey or thy neighbor, his man servant. It's a commandment that recognizes slavery.

Speaker 7:          01:41:16       Jesus Christ that wrap your fucking head around the Bible, baby. Wrap your head around the, it's funny how people choose to believe in like parts of it. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:41:28       I know. And the wording of parts of it as if it wasn't translated from ancient Hebrew to Hebrew to Roman fucking English, and it's like, and you're going to tell me about the subtlety of the way he said gay people shouldn't lie together

Speaker 7:          01:41:41       in 2000 years later, my favorite is when people tattoo biblical quotes on their body. So you're really not supposed to do that. Like it says it in the Bible, you're not supposed to get a tattoo. I'm like, yeah, but I don't think Jesus meant it that much. I also think it might be

Speaker 4:          01:41:58       fall under the first commandment or is the second about thou shalt not have graven images. You should not have representations of God. And I think by extension, why are we hiding? Why do we have fucking crosses with Jesus hanging off the wall of that you're isn't that kind of covered by extension on the second commandment? Do we want to his, he is fucking bloody corpse.

Speaker 7:          01:42:16       So very strange practice to look at that all the time. You know, and the idea that you're being reminded of the deity, the one perfect being that existed, oh thousands of years ago and since then his followers, her reverted to pedophilia and fucking craziness and fear. Yeah, I know. I know this coming that has a cross on his arm and I don't, I'm not friends with him, but he always wears like, like those like elastic band things on his arm just to cover it up so no one knows. Oh really? That's funny. You get it removed. Yeah, get a cover up. Maybe he still likes it and he's hiding it from comics. Oh, well it could be that some people get too ashamed of being religious. A lot of fighters get religious. It's like he gives them something to, to, to really lean back on, you know, something to give them strength. And you know, I've always said that I don't have any fucking idea whether there's a god, I'm not a religious person, but uh, I leave anything up to the idea of possibility. I think anything could be possible. Anything, well, it definition

Speaker 4:          01:43:23       of God, but to think that there's not some power that orchestrated did miracle of, you know, like we regenerating DNA, all that shit. You know, to think that there's not something that can tell you that I know how big the moon is going to be at what point in the sky and fucking 50 years and be right. You know, give me a fucking break of course, whatever you want to call that. I think that I always just default in nature is God and fill in the details. When, when, when I know more

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       well it, it could very well be that there is an intelligence to all of nature that we're just not capable of, of, of tuning into. It could very well be the trees and all sorts of different parts of nature have some sort of intelligence. It just doesn't translate into words. It doesn't try and translate into, you know, certain noises that we recognize with certain images and certain meanings. It could be some other form of intelligence and it's, it's super possible that the reason why, you know, we exist in this ever changing world and this world is, you know, being more and more hostile to people is that it kind of recognizes us as a threat. You know, the you, if you have to think of this system has got to be prepared for everything. Okay? There's a reason why certain animals eat other animals and certain diseases kill certain percentages of the people.

Speaker 1:          01:44:46       There's like this crazy corrective system that goes on on earth and we agree with that up until it gets to people. We don't ever want to think that Earth could ever look at us like, wait, we might be some fucking cold that it has and that the more we pull the fucking fish out of the ocean and throw our garbage in it and the more we pollute the sky and change the temperature of it and fuck the whole balance of it up and in artificially change the levels of certain things in the environment, we should expect that the earth is going to respond to this change accordingly. It's going to try to push back. I mean if, if it is intelligent, if there's some real method to the whole idea of this whole thing evolving from hot ball of rock and lava and then somehow or another acquiring water and somehow or another

Speaker 4:          01:45:42       more matters, more elements and more life forms. Yeah. Just keep going and going and going. And it's all it's, you know, and it goes back to like a turn of the 19th century. There was a lot of, um, uh, so a social scientist and England mills who talked about population naturally controls itself, wars, disease, that there is an actual healthy number of people to be on the earth. And because of science, we've been able to just completely fucking hyper below that number of people to the point where we've staved off and natural correction. We haven't had war in any real war and a long time. We haven't had any fucking plague in a long time. You know the play again, 19th during World War One, 1970 killed one out of three people in, in Europe including, well the war and the plate together. And you know, we, if we had that now, people would, they'd lose the shit. People can't even imagine a devastation. They don't think it's possible. Whereas numerically, it's beyond possible. It's way overdue. Well, there was a super volcano

Speaker 2:          01:46:50       warning today, um, somewhere, God, I want to say that. I want to say, I want to say somewhere in the South Pacific. I don't, I don't really remember, but there was um, a warning not to travel to this particular area because it had been some volcanic activity. Maybe someone a la, let me know what the fuck it is on Twitter, but we had a couple earthquakes at the California hundreds, right? Well, it wasn't hundreds. No Shit. Yeah. Well, there's an area in Yellowstone where they have thousands of earthquakes a year. Thousands.

Speaker 7:          01:47:22       She should ask, not just Yogi bear chasing boom, boom, boom.

Speaker 2:          01:47:28       Oh booboo. What is another guy got killed by a bear in Alaska and that's where you're going? Yes. The hardest dark. The guy who got killed by the bear was a out there photographing it and standing near it way closer than what they tell you too. He was within 50 yards. Like you should never get within 50 yards, 50 yards. That's, yeah, that seems far. Yup. Yeah. You should be far as fuck. Yeah. You shouldn't make clothes because you most likely you'll be fine. But if you get too close to a bear and he decides for whatever reason that he hasn't eaten in a while, and you might see if you're at a ball, if he's desperate, you can catch a desperate bear, especially late in the year, like when it gets close to like December, you know, some of those barriers are still walking around. Those are the dangerous ones cause they're not stuffed yet. They're not, they're not ready to hibernate. That's how that grizzly man God got got. Yeah, he went wandering around out there after. It was like post season when they were, uh, the, most of the healthy bears are already in heartland nation.

Speaker 7:          01:48:28       It's like being in Faneuil hall at two in the morning when the bars get out. Exactly. If you're not home, the ancients, last chance for romance, you didn't get laid and now you're going to look for a fight. And that's what, what happened at two 15.

Speaker 2:          01:48:40       That one little, uh, what is it? A fast food place? It a Mcdonald's. It's on the corner of that. That was why that hotel that we used to stay out of it. We would go to Faneuil hall. Remember that place that we worked at? The comedy connection then

Speaker 7:          01:48:51       it was a chain, you remember the thing was called Donald's, but like it wasn't Mcdonnell Ari and Brian, Wendy's Ren Brian walked there and almost got in a fight. Yeah. Like twice and just waiting in line everywhere it goes. And you know, I didn't like Boston the first, like three, two times. We went there because we kept on going to that comedy club in that area. And then they call it the combat zone. It's like one bad block and awful. And then we, the last time we went, we went somewhere else. We stayed in this really nice hotel and they're filming a movie. There's all these actors in it, but it wasn't like a totally different experience. It was like being in New York on Monday, we were, um, we were at the connection and Faneuil hall wasn't in the comments. Okay. Wasn't there, but the connection was, uh, yeah, the, the, the Wilbur is actually, oh, like go a way cooler set. You know, it's a beautiful environment and everything like that. But that area is not, it's not the dangerous area. It was when we were doing standup, like people don't understand the fucking, they have like a four seasons there now. You know,

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       it's, it's a gorgeous area. When we were coming up and stand up, it was the combat zone. You would walk over there, they would be hookers. It was scary. You'd see people smoking crack, you would see peep show booze and they slowly squeezed all that shit out. That was like our one CD

Speaker 4:          01:50:03       area. I remember I could always park on the street because nobody would park on the street that had a piece of shit because you're, my window got smashed so many fucking times. You just were, you were just used to it.

Speaker 1:          01:50:14       Yeah. That area around next man, you got your, your fucking car got broken into all the time. Unless you've got a spot on that street, on warrant and street. When you would go around that little side area where the connection was the old connection and go down to the end where Nick's was. Every now and then he'd catch a spot. You get super fucking lucky. Yeah. But that whole area is a gay bar. No. Do Dude

Speaker 10:         01:50:35       is detective Byrd.

Speaker 1:          01:50:40       Uh, yeah, that much with the cubs game. Like a really a hot gate. Will you let me, let me get in the back door.

Speaker 10:         01:50:50       You went with a bug door line, Fred Sammons cheeses.

Speaker 1:          01:50:53       Um, but the, yeah, that area. Um, at one point in time it was uh, there was two comedy clubs in the same theater where the same area where the connection was. There was the connection. And then above it and my, my car cat a place, remember that? I don't remember my Clarks. Yeah. He had some sort of a comedy club. It was, it wasn't for a long time. It was in the same theater that they used to do the heads like some long ass running show. One of those fucking, oh, you're talking about above the original comedy. Oh yeah. Upstairs they had some kind of a nun's you one of those, he's a little run or some fucking shit done sense. I think that's nonsense. None Sanity. Um, and then down the street you had Nick's, which had three different rooms, 50 yards away, 50 yards away.

Speaker 1:          01:51:38       They had an upstairs and then they had two downstairs, one smaller room, and then one that was like a disco. You remember the disco Rome that didn't really make it that they got rid of the disco after awhile. It's like too crazy. But guys would do that. And then across the street there was the fucking duck soup at what's now the Wilbur theater. Duck soup was the, the idea of a Billy Downs. And Paul Barkley had this idea to put a super upscale comedy club and put it in Boston right there and charge more money and have only clean comedians. Yeah. And it didn't work.

Speaker 4:          01:52:14       It didn't work. But then you forgetting dicta already had a room. If you walk then across the street and through a mini mall, there was the comedy vault, which had been a bank. Yes. And the fucking room was, the fault was still there. And you would stand in this little fucking room. That was a bag and it was a sweet little room. It's gray room. But I mean it's, you're talking about within literally within a quarter of a mile, you had even three, four, five, six, six comedy rooms and they were all

Speaker 1:          01:52:41       good. Yeah, it's ridiculous. We're becoming those, those annoying

Speaker 2:          01:52:46       old dudes to keep repeating stories about the glory days. But what people don't understand is just how, that's by the way, that's a meme. What people don't understand. Cause I always say that when I don't know exactly what am I saying next time is that the, the scene was just to us now today, looking back on it, as you know, you see what's around today. It's so, it was such a spectacular scene. It was just the most amazing scene for like developing as a comedian.

Speaker 4:          01:53:11       Well you look at like, did you read the book outliers? No. It's this book about how people like Bill Gates came about at a certain time. They had a certain gift that wasn't necessarily a good thing. Like I think gates is mildly Asperger's. He was born, he was born in the Santa Cruz area just as the tech thing was exploding and he used, I think it was Santa Cruz, whatever the UC college had the first like mainframe computer as a teenager. He was going in there and writing programs. So he was at the beginning of a wave with the exact personality type and he carried it through and became something that you can't do again. And like Howard stern was an outlier with radio. He became the guy who did all the things you weren't supposed to do on radio, bad mouth, other people be dirty self aggrandize and all the sudden this wave of syndication of radio stations came about and he fucking caught that wave and took and with talent. This is talent God given fucking, uh, you know, a weird recipe for what matches the demands of that time and being in front of the explosion that happens. And I believe that we were very much in the outliers spot of standup comedy by being Boston at that time.

Speaker 2:          01:54:24       It was a very unusual environment for sure. It's sad that it doesn't exist anymore. It's when a friend saw me to put out that documentary when standup stood out. Yeah. And it's really interesting, but I think he kind of nailed it is that the, the scene was fantastic until people started making it when, uh, when everybody just wanted to be funny.

Speaker 4:          01:54:40       You are one of the first ones. No, no. Yeah, I remember Joe Rogan cause everybody's back. They're gone. But you hear Joe, Joe moved here. Dude, he's, he gets to do the prompt shows the danger fields. That was literally like, people were like me making this shit. Well, I'm just saying in steps and then Joe Rogan just signed with a a what? Jeff's then all of a sudden Joe Rogan just got out a hundred thousand dollar deal with Disney and we knew every detail your fucking career because nobody had done that before. Nobody from our class had gone anywhere really except like, you know, I remember a Budd Friedman came to Boston and did a showcase to do evening at the Improv and we, it was like the for months we were fucking obsessed with our set and a couple people got it out of it. And uh, and that was our closest brush to show business until you all of a sudden God on this fucking track. And it was like, wow, you can do that from this. So you ruined everything. That was real.

Speaker 2:          01:55:36       Well everybody thought for some reason that the only way you would ever get on TVs if you were clean. And I thought the only way I would ever want to do comedy as if I was funny.

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       So I knew I wasn't good and because I wasn't good, my dirty comedy wasn't, it was unbearable because it's like not as, it just not, is it offensive? Not only is it offensive, but it's also bad. It's bad and offensive, which is like way worse. Yeah. Yeah. Well in the beginning I think, I think, you know, take, took a while for me to figure out how to do it right, how to do shit that I actually thought it was funny, but I knew I could never do it clean. I just wasn't going to try. I just was like, nope. I just, I, I, I fall, I'll scratch together some little five minute sets here and there, but that seems crazy. Like why would I do that? Why would I limit what I'm thinking about? Why it seems like that's like step one to fucking yourself. You know? I just got lucky that it worked. It didn't have to work. It could have skid off into the fucking woods and I could have become some kind of an,

Speaker 4:          01:56:31       the thing about that time though, there was no roadmap for it. And that's what an outlier is. It's like you're the, you're a pioneer in the sense that you're breaking the rules and yet you're rising up faster than anybody else because things change and there becomes the, you know, the needs and the demands of the marketplace for whatever it is you do. A, they change very kooky. They're dynamic and the, and the, and it's why we have the, you know, variation and species. It's Darwinism.

Speaker 1:          01:56:57       Yeah. And it's, I've also felt like when, when anything happens to that it's good, then you actually believe that good things can happen. So for me it's like believing that something good can happen. Like all I could think of was, well, you know, if I keep working at this more good things can happen. Like I'm on a roll and I, I don't want to stop this role. And so I think, um, you know, when you're a young guy and you know, your life has been like Kinda like half sketchy, filled with a lot of fucking failures, all relationship failure is all like, oh, just different failures that you go through and then you're on stage and you're trying to do comedy. Like just trying to make sense of that aspect of your past. When you look back on your, your life of being an open miker and that the wild experience of, you know, trying to fucking do that for a living, it doesn't even feel like it's you does it, I mean, doesn't it feel like it's a lie, you know, it feels like you're, you're accessing memories that were copied a hundred times over and they're real shitty and you like, I think it was this Guy Larry Rowe poochie yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:58:04       Larry Alario Gucci. Yeah. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:58:05       yeah. And I think I wore shirts that had zipper is going down the arms and I think I had a mullet and I think I did a joke about what I do and girls are calling me and none of it's, and, and I also look at it like limitless fucking energy and passion. I would tape every set, rewrite it. I would fucking drive me anyway. We would drive all over the fucking place. It was, there was no limit. And then I'd get up at the crack of dawn and do fucking banquet waitering and then I would go audition for some cold call bullshit downtown. I mean, there was not like now where I got to pace myself, pick my battles back then it was no, every fucking battle I'm in. Yeah, and somewhere

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       along the line I think as a standup comedian, you forget that this was a terrifying time. Like those times that you talked about were terrifying, but might've been the most exciting moments of your life, you know? I mean the, the, the first couple of sets that you do that are good, that feeling when you're like, holy fucking shit. I think I'm onto something. And then you become obsessed. Did you want to write things down everywhere you go? Because yeah,

Speaker 6:          01:59:08       I went to college and to me it was like I was told what to do and how to thank for four years there were tests on a set of information I was supposed to learn and internalize and believe. Then you're going to stand out and it's a blank slate. It's what do you think? Would you believe when you make that work? And all of a sudden I felt in a way like that made me grow up in six months more than I did in four years in college because it was all my creation.

Speaker 2:          01:59:37       Yeah. Yeah. Well that's one of the most important things about, uh, you know, really finding yourself as putting something down and been able to look at it and go, I fucking, I got that. I did dad. I got, this is an actual thing that I did. Like, here it is, it's put, I put it down and then you can move on from it. So easy. So much more easy. You get more momentum. Yeah. Did you ever read the war of Art Steven Pressfield Book? What's it called? The war of art now you told me about that, dude. I've got a copy for you. Yeah. Yeah. Brian,

Speaker 6:          02:00:06       by the way, I want to on the air. Thank Joe Rogan for one of the best gifts I've gotten in the last fucking 10 years. Uh, a beautiful, I'm going to mispronounce the name, aerial Carmeli Aerial Carmeli pool cue. And I am a, I am a pool, just an addict my whole life. And uh, I've, I haven't had a pool cue and about

Speaker 2:          02:00:25       15 years. So under that shelf down there, there's two books to see him. It's the war of art during the corner. Can you reach it and no, no. You Yoga doing bitch. All right. I'll find it. I'll give it to you after a show. Remind me there. It's there. Right there. He just can't reach over. He's impossible. It was a cop down the Canyon de Chelly. Oh yeah. He would already be talking that who'd already, we know Brian. It's okay. Don't get it. It's no, no, no, no. It's no big deal. It's the most passive aggressive thing. Yeah. Shit from the other side. Right. All right man. Just leave it there. Yeah, don't worry about it man. I totally cool with it. I'm really happy with it. No big deal right next to you. No, no, no. There you go. That's the book. I bought a bunch of copies just to give it to me like it's got dust all over it. Yep.

Speaker 6:          02:01:18       I love it. Break through the blocks and when your inner creative battle, fuck yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:01:22       It's a great book. All right. I love it. It's a great book for like creativity and I'm sort of getting past the roadblocks of, um, procrastination. Oh fuck. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Somebody showed me, this one's been very interesting work. The guy stuff you

Speaker 6:          02:01:38       kind of read and then on each thing.

Speaker 2:          02:01:40       Yeah. Well, you know, it's an ethic. The guy provides an ethic and he's got a new one called turning pro, which is just as good. I just got into that. But he's a very inspirational dude. You know, I, uh, I love hearing about dudes who work really hard. I don't like hearing about guys who would come crazy and become obsessed and become unhealthy, like they work too much. But I like hearing about dudes who have like a great work ethic. Like could always, like whenever I hear about Louis C K putting out a new hour every year, I always like, I love hearing that. That's inspirational to me. I felt like I get like some energy out of that. Like, Ooh, look this palsy. Um, it's too much for me. It turned out I did a, I did mine. Then I did another one in the little less than two years and that's why I was doing like a lot of the UFC stuff as well. I do less UFC stuff now than I did before, so it was while I was doing that, but I still feel like I like to have a bit around for awhile, like a year or some stuff.

Speaker 6:          02:02:32       Bets are fucking thick too. I mean, it's not like you write a free standing joke and have to write another, I mean you, you find something and you explore it and you extend it and then by the end you got to chunk. That's 10 minutes. So you string together six of those. You've got an hour

Speaker 2:          02:02:48       and I, I, you know, I know there's like more life to shit sometimes, but it's like I put some stuff on a special before and then right after it's, and you're like, oh, you motherfucker, the punch line of punchline comes out, you know, the tag line, it changes the whole thing.

Speaker 6:          02:03:01       Dana Gould's just gave me a tagline that took a bit that was already killing and doubled. It really, I get this bit about how we, uh, waste water in this country. How we just have fun with it. It's like a joke. We Have Waterpark, we have fountains which just shoot water in the air. Like, fuck you look at all this water. And then Dana's tagline was, and then what do we do? We take money we don't need and we throw it in the fountain and on top of always killing that tagline, just like instant applause,

Speaker 2:          02:03:28       right? So true. That's a perfect like description of, uh, like ridiculous opulence. Giant fountain. Well, see what you could dip in and dip your feet in. Sit in front talk.

Speaker 6:          02:03:40       It's like a kid with a pot in his lap and it's, it's like he's pissing, you ever see those pissing out of it?

Speaker 2:          02:03:45       I saw a house in Montecito once, you know Santa Barbara? Yeah. That was, these people had like, they must have owned a museum or some shit, but they had a fountain that was so big. They converted it into a swimming pool was fucking huge. This huge gorgeous fountain was a swimming pool. These people have like three fountains as houses, ridiculous like that Monosito area of Santa Barbara. It's like some of the most gorgeous houses like you've ever seen. You're like, Oh hell yeah. Perfect weather all year round. They're looking over the ocean and you're like, Holy Shit. Anytime

Speaker 6:          02:04:17       I'm in that part of the world, you go down below San Francisco, they got to think all the seven mile drive, which is where like Pebble Beach Golf Club is and I really do think that there is not a more beautiful place. I mean, I haven't been to like Tuscany. I'm sure there's places, but I feel like you can actually afford to live in a place along the code, the Jag, California coast where the weather is fucking perfect. All the, it's

Speaker 4:          02:04:38       just peaceful people and I sort of feel like, why not do that? Teach school

Speaker 2:          02:04:43       each school, what would he do? And living in a fucking movie. We're going to learn how to bake bread. Yeah, I lost it. They're faking shots are, that's crazy. There are some places like Carmel, like you ever been to word those were Clint Eastwood was the male is right below where I'm talking about. Oh is it right below that? Right there. So fucking beautiful. It's so beautiful. You get hot, cold

Speaker 4:          02:05:02       town. It's all like art galleries and cafes that are fucking, you know, international and it's bad. I mean, but it's one of those things where hope you like white people cause that's all we got here. Rich white people.

Speaker 2:          02:05:13       Yeah. That's a real white town, right? Old White people. That's all public. Yeah. Yeah. He said some crazy shit at the Republican. Oh, he's losing his marbles for sure. Right.

Speaker 4:          02:05:25       Hey. Well it's like, it's tough because those John Wayne type guys, they come from an era where you know men were manly and it was simple and it was black and white and it's just a different world now and you try to, you, you can't shake clinics was not going to not be that guy. But the times dictated different, more layered approach to things.

Speaker 2:          02:05:43       I think he's missing a substantial amount of what he used to have as a young man as far as his intuition on how to do things correctly. He just doesn't seem, he didn't seem there. It seemed like a big struggle to me. That whole thing where he's bringing in John Voight how much on my shelf it was. There was something weird about it. You know, the, just all the crazy talk about him being a conservative and it'll conservatives and we just try to, you know, play our cards closer to our vest. Like what are you getting wrapped up with? Are you, do you really believe this narrative? Do you really believe this or are you actually paying attention to what you're supporting by being there, pretending to talk to a chair. Like if you talk to the president like that, he should have beat the fuck out of here. He should box your ears. Who the fuck are you to talk to the president like that credibly,

Speaker 4:          02:06:32       that whole fucking thing was just negating. None of it was putting out here's our real, here's our plan for the economic recovery specifically. All it was was tax cuts and more shit. We're going to give you stuff that adds up to negative and yet they're selling it by by basically dismantling what already existed. Like everything was a negation. There was no positive energy about it.

Speaker 2:          02:06:57       Yeah. It's a weird thing to watch this all play out to watch this Mitt Romney guy and to see this, this whole situation. It's really weird. It's weird. It's weird to watch it play out man. As Paul Ryan Dude has already been busted line on all sorts of shit. He said he ran a marathon in less than three hours. Yup. That's like world class.

Speaker 4:          02:07:16       They could they, they timed it and it was four hours over four hours over an hour in New Yorker did this piece last month about this guy who was a serial marathon liar and he had a website about raising money for kids with fucking down syndrome and support them. This guy has a dentist in a small town in Michigan who everybody loves and he's got this whole reputation about being this marathon runner who's going to run in all 48 states in, in the continental us, and he's going to, he's going to do a marathon and each one is going to post this. His results, well, they're starting to be a couple questions about that. He hadn't, they, there was no pictures of him in the middle of certain races. There is a fearsome marathon contingent that that tracks every single marathon. One of the things I have is these chips and you have to, you have to hit I think three chips during the race to to prevent the rosy ruins thing for someone jumping in a car.

Speaker 4:          02:08:10       So they went back and they looked at the chips. He fucking hit all of his chips in everyone. But then there's pictures of them in different outfits. There's races where there's no pictures. There was one race. He actually made up what? He just made up a range. No, but he posted that he wanted to have a San Jose Marathon. Nobody responded. So, so he posted 10 with 10 people that finish in a certain time, made up the names, put them on the website and had him as the winner. Oh, that's hilarious. So He's, so anyway, they unraveled it and it was just more like it was, the piece was just about how people can get, what is it called when you lie and you have no, you have no guilt about it. Um, sociopath, sociopath, like this is a sociopath about marathons. Everything else in his life was totally fucking straight up. Good guy. Except this crazy man. And so the point being there was a very clear record with Paul Ryan of how La, there's no discrepancy. There's no, you know, he absolutely ran it in four hours and 10 minutes to set it. Still Pretty fucking good. Really? They say that's average. I think that's pretty good for a guy that looks like that. It's like an 11 minute mile. Amazing. Didn't quit. Quit all the marathon. Amazing. Made it through. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:09:25       It's a hard thing to do. My amazement, anybody runs 26 miles. But why lie about the time when four hours on still pretty fucking good. He's trying to pretend like he's like a super athlete.

Speaker 4:          02:09:35       Well that's the problem is that if he lies about that, tell me it's a character thing, period. What if he's lying about that? What else is going to lie about his numbers for the economy are a fucking joke. They'd been debunked by bipartisan committees in Congress because he introduced this whole new economic recovery plan and it was looked at and they said, this is horse shit. This does not add up. But he had every Republican lined up because he was the new hot shit in in Congress when he came in as a junior

Speaker 2:          02:10:04       senator. What is his strategy or his philosophy that he's going to do? It's different. What was his idea?

Speaker 4:          02:10:10       Well, it's real and rand this guy, so it's pure free market. There's no regulations and a you the, you know the, it's letting capitalism basically dictate everything and it's about getting rid of the safety net entirely. He wants to take apart Medicare. He wants the entire new healthcare program taken, taken away. He wants to prioritize social security, which again has been shown in study after study after study is a worst case scenario. You're taking a fund of money that people have paid into with a very nominal, uh, broker with service fee, you know, built into a 0.04% or whatever and you're saying, okay, everyone grabbed theirs, give it to a broker who's going to take 5% your bloating, this one industry because they've lobbied you. That's all. That's all this is about. Banks want to be able to get their hands on this money and crank up commissions in, in making the investments for you. That's all this boils down to.

Speaker 1:          02:11:07       Ran into a, due to one of my shows who, uh, is an Iraq war veteran and he went in, he actually volunteered for the army and then right after he volunteered, um, I don't remember which branch I said the army, I might be wrong or right after, I think it was actually the air force right after he volunteered, nine 11 happened. So right afterwards he's going to war. And, uh, he'd said that one of the first things that the United States government did was they printed Iraqi money, just fucking crazy amounts of it and just flooded the market with fake money. And that's how you're crushing economy. Is that amazing? Like, you know, wanted to crush our economy. They would just make, just put millions and millions of dollars like in the streets and people would go crazy and run out and buy Ferrari's, Ferrari's, it'd be worth nothing. Anything that happened here.

Speaker 1:          02:11:54       Do you think that's a, could it happen here? I, yes. Look, the, the, the economy is not based on anything. That's what the idea of a gold standard. That's where it's supposed to make some sense. And the idea though that you're, you're going to be able to make something like a dollar bill that can't be reproduced by somebody with nefarious means. Of course. They're going to be able to figure that out. Man. As technology gets better, they're not going to be able to hold off the, that whole printing press thing. People are going to figure out how to make money.

Speaker 4:          02:12:19       To this day, the, uh, I forget what the Iranian and Iraqi currency is, but a DNR I think. Yes, exactly. It is the lowest rated currency on the planet. It's like a hundred thousand per $1.

Speaker 7:          02:12:32       What do you do then? Do you have to start from scratch? You have to start. The whole civilization

Speaker 4:          02:12:36       got to go to the gold standard. I mean it's, you got to find something to tether it to.

Speaker 1:          02:12:41       Yeah. And then by then the militaries in the streets and you're fucked. I scramble.

Speaker 4:          02:12:46       Yeah. You know what's amazing is you're talking about Mesopotamia. You're talking about the most fertile, the origins of all civilization. And it's a fuck zone.

Speaker 1:          02:12:55       It's amazing. Well, I've, I think they're the townies of the world.

Speaker 7:          02:13:01       I think that's what it is. They just been around too long. That's where civilization was invented. So that, that area, that's the, sorry, same assholes who developed their civilization 6,000 years ago. They just stayed. Everybody else is like, these people are fucking crazy. They're throwing rocks at people for dancing. Let's get outta here. So every other civilization branched off from that one part. But they stayed and they got, yeah, they got two story. I got a double decker. I'm fucking rent out the upstairs to my parents.

Speaker 7:          02:13:32       Do you want, when you go back to Ohio, do you relate to townies or do you think that Ohio is like a better place to live? Did you go back and forth? Boring. But I mean if I could have a humongous house, you know, and people live great there. Everyone has, my sister has two kids, works as a hairstylist, but she has a huge house and a huge yard. So it just seems, it's weird. It's easier and more comfortable. It's not as stressful. It's not, it's weird how much variation there is and areas where you could buy a house variation. The money, like who she, you know, I'm so white you can get, and you know, another thing was is like when you walk to your car at night and when you do certain things, you automatically feel safe out there. Like you could just sit there and just have money in your both of your hands and walk to your car after going to a movie. And no one would give a shit dude, from that video that you made, that dude who went to the 100 best videos, by the way, the Heckler, the drunk heckler and Columbus. Oh yeah. Remember that one? Yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:14:30       dude, that was first of all, that was a awesome video. You may cause you the way you edit it was so funny. It was just, the dude was so ridiculous. But we missed the best part of the story because this guy who had his shirt off and my comedy show screaming, yelling. Yeah. Yeah. I came off stage and I hugged him. It was like the most ridiculous shit of all time. He was just like so hammered. He was so crazy. We ran into him at the end of the night, face covered in blood shirt lists. Just somebody beat the fuck out of this guy. And I looked at him and I looked at them on, sorry dude.

Speaker 7:          02:15:02       Yeah, but we didn't, we didn't fuck it filled that need to know. No one had anything on. So we were like, Shit. Yeah, I saw this dude. I was in. Um,

Speaker 2:          02:15:11       and Jose, if you do that fucking club in San Jose, the Improv. Oh yeah. Fucking amazing. I'm supposed to do it sometime soon, but the, the, the show got moved. It was a for, I was going to do the Friday night before UFC. Places like a 500 year old ancient theater, three Charlie Chaplin perform their cheese and acoustics. You don't even for 500 years old. I'm just making shit up. There weren't people in California five and years ago. Stupid. What would the ass tax doing? A standup show. Isn't that weird? That just 500 years ago there was no people. And you've got to Europe and you'd like to talk about Iraq. It's like they got a history. Yeah, that's San Jose Improv is one of the most beautiful interiors, like the, the inside and the feel of it. Like it feels like, uh, like a seasoned performance room, well worn room and the guy that runs a jam is fucking treated me great.

Speaker 2:          02:16:01       Anyway, professional bowler. Yes. Bad mother fucker. He was a Vietnam vet too. Good too. He a, he goes bowling and just fucks people up apparently. Apparently he's like legit worldclass bowler and he'll go to Vegas and people gamble in Vegas, you know, they get crazy. They're out there on vacation. Well it's called ball a few frames. They start talking shit and you know he comes over and he knows how to him until he knows how to play their ego. And he starts getting involved in a big gambling with some knuckleheads and he's come back with like

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       sick money from gambling in Vegas. Yeah. And he's such as fucking

Speaker 4:          02:16:34       cool guy. Just unabashedly the real deal. Cool. Just a cool guy. Yeah, he's a, and you know he got fuck man. He went to Vietnam three and a half years, came back, did his 21 years in the navy and now he's like, yeah, I get 120 bucks a month and fucking benefit. He goes, they cut all the benefits that you're promised and including like going to the Va hospital and get, get your glasses, dental, all that. Shit's gone to do that. That's my, what the fuck. You get pro, you go to war, you put your life on the line for the country. You are fucking taken care of period. That that is the biggest travesty happening right now.

Speaker 1:          02:17:13       Some UFC fights, we did it for the, some institute for traumatic brain injury, I believe it's called and it was there. They're building some huge thing so they had to raise money for it. So the UFC fights raised a lot of money for it. But one of the things I was thinking of was how crazy is it that there's these billion dollar deals that these people like Halliburton and these companies around there like Halliburton get billion dollar deals in in it somehow or another is not the money for these rehabilitation centers. Like that's insane. The fact that they can profit off the war and not be giving anything back in the form of some, at least you know, do what what a charity is doing. At least do that. I mean you're profiting from the charities just stepping in.

Speaker 4:          02:17:55       That's exactly why it's privatized because the u s government allows itself to be buffered from number one. If there's a rape overseas eat, doesn't it? It does not get processed in US courts. They've got, they've got all illegal people work in the jobs, they tit tell these girls in the Philippines, the Halliburton does through another agency that they get it, they're going to get a job doing hairstyling and they're going to make 40 grand a year. They take them off and they're working at fucking burger king in the mid, in the Mideast sleeping in fucking tankers and paying off the money. They had to pay to get over there for like five or six years before they make a dollar and slavery. Yeah. It's fucking slavery, slavery word.

Speaker 1:          02:18:34       They'd just, they have it written down somewhere. So it's like okay to do. Yup. Somehow or another,

Speaker 4:          02:18:39       cause it's not the US government because the US government is sub contracting to Halliburton so that you know, any kind of, uh, any kind of lawsuits that come in, don't they don't touch the u s government. And so they, so they're not paying out to the soldiers because they have no real relationship.

Speaker 1:          02:18:55       You slavery without chains, just make it so they can't leave. Yes. May mean you might lose one or two every now and then, but you can get them back. You can get different ones and it's a terrifying sort of a situation. But that's like a lot of what's going on apparently in parts of the Middle East in like Dubai or did that gone on and some uh, construction sites, I think didn't vice do a special on that Brian?

Speaker 4:          02:19:17       I don't know. Yeah, they said if he buys things do by, brings in people from, um, I don't know. I can't remember what country it is, but they bring them in on these, they're not even, they're like work visas that are like a week long and the second you're done with your work, you're gone. It just, you don't earn your way in. And so that's something like, you know, three quarters of the work force is not from that country and they just have these sprawling fucking camps that people live in. And then they kicked him out as soon as now instantly. No, no coverage in accidents whatsoever. It's barbaric.

Speaker 1:          02:19:51       It's fucked up too, because again, we're talking about the townies of the world. So they really still are rocking it the same way they did a thousand years ago or several thousand years ago. There really are rocking it like that. Yeah, just rocking it like that. Behind the rules. I mean, they really do steel, it's still have kings and uh, there was some piece on, on, on um, that dude, um, who, uh, we had Brian on the podcast the other day, David Seaman, he had something that's his real name, powerful dude though. He's a great guy. That is his real name. Um, and there was something that he had on his Twitter page. It showed how CNN had some stories about the Arab spring uprising in Bahrain and they decided not to aerate and uh, apparently about rain is fucked up and people start to make youtube videos of it and put them online because there's not enough interest in, you know, there's so many, everyone's aware of Saudi Arabia, everyone's aware of, you know, what's happening in Egypt. Everyone's aware of Libya, but a lot of people are not aware about rain, so they're still trying to keep this one locked down. And while everything else is going on, but there's some horrific fucking foot. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          02:20:59       and it's just government controlled media. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:21:01       man. They're gunning people down there trying to stop a civil uprising. It's horrific stuff, man. Horrific stuff. And there's really graphic videos available on,

Speaker 4:          02:21:11       and our interest in the average spring ended about a year ago. People don't even know what's going on is worse than any of it. And people aren't even fucking tracking that because it's like we, ah, we already had Egypt, we already had Libya. Where we've got our Phil,

Speaker 1:          02:21:22       what people don't understand is the pocalypse is here. It just hasn't reached California with the apocalypse of you're in Bahrain, that's the apocalypse. If friends are getting their heads blown off right next to you by sniper rifles, that's the apocalypse. I mean, this is a civil war. People are dying in the street. The government is gunning down civilians. I mean, it's craziness.

Speaker 4:          02:21:45       But what about the places that like Egypt that now has democratically elected do there really, isn't it? The Muslim Brotherhood, they were voted in and they're, you know what? They're not as bad as people think as they say. The sound rather. They sound scary. You know what though? It's one of those things. Where are they going to snake it in? They get an office, everything's cool. I'm gets a Turkey at Thanksgiving. Two years later the women are all in fucking potato sacks.

Speaker 1:          02:22:08       I wonder how much longer that's going to work with the Internet with the distribution of information that we have right now. It gets harder and harder to convince kids of nonsense. It's harder and harder. It's just not the same sort of animal that was around when we grew up. Lou, when we grew up, you know even if you didn't believe in God but made no sense, you hedge your bet one on one with everything and you know you believe it is real. I did all that Shit I was supposed to do. Even if you don't have a whole ton of faith in it, you don't have the kind of access to him or we didn't rather have the kind of access to information that kids have today. Cause if they have a question about anything, like why is the sky blue? They Google, why is the sky blue? I mean kids are growing up doing that now. So they ever have a car, you can't just bullshit them.

Speaker 6:          02:22:45       Yeah. You're assuming the internet stays is free as it is now. I mean you just by saying Google, you know, so many people get their information from two portals. You've got Wikipedia and Google and if those are, you know, Google is part of a multinational corporation and eventually they're going to rein it in because of corporate sponsors are because the same pressure CNN gets to not put out stuff about Bahrain. Any big company is, is ultimately going to be effected by the people that are running it.

Speaker 1:          02:23:11       Did you hear that? Some of those leat hacker dude's hacked into a, uh, an FBI laptop and found the names of a hundred of no 14 million, uh, apple ios users. They found the information on them.

Speaker 6:          02:23:29       I don't know what station three they cracked into that database and got all those names. It's fucking crazy. Index box. Well, cause they chair the, what's crazy is challenging and they said you'll never crack. That was either playstation, Xbox that challenged the hackers.

Speaker 1:          02:23:44       Basically they can get through anything. But the, um, the, what was scary about it was that these, you know, this, this whole hacker thing like really wasn't really recognized. Yeah. Yeah. I mean when like when you see like that Guy Kevin Mitnick, you know, that guy is, do you know what that guy is? He was like a really famous hacker. He was a guy who at one point in time they offered him a job eventually at one of the big companies who would do like what's called phone freaking or you um, phone freaking you'll like you, you figure out like how to get, um, make calls through like a box that would send a tone down the line. This is like the step one. It's like the hacking the system. It's like back when dial tone phones came online when diet was, see before dial tones. We all remember when you were really little kid, you had to spin that dial, which is really like alien to people today.

Speaker 1:          02:24:39       But when you dial a number you'd go down a lodge. It was ridiculous. And then they came out with a dial tone situation. But what someone realized somewhere along the line is that there's a computer or something interfacing on the other end that's responding to the tones and those tones represent a number. So let's find out what those tones represent and then we could fucking do whatever we want. And to have access to free unlimited long distance calling. Because remember back then you couldn't get long distance. Long distance was hard. Yeah. Like if you dated a girl and she lived in the five Oh eight, you'd be like, oh Jesus, she loves way the fuck over there. It's the long distance and then any, any sort of a state crossing state lines, long distance. That was a long distance call. Your fucking parents

Speaker 7:          02:25:24       would scream with you. You're a long distance. It could be 10 miles away. Remember it used to have held a separate long distance company to like at and t, but I had sprint as my long distance. Right. Spring can save your money. Do you remember when, um, they used to have it for cell phones were long distance for cell phones. It's like super expensive. Crazy. Do you remember that was crazy. He'd use a calling card, which meant you had to punch in about 16 numbers before you put in the number you are calling. Yes, exactly. Yeah, I remember that. But this, uh, this Kevin Mitnick guy, he started out doing that and then eventually it went to be in some sort of a full blown hacker. But to go from that to be able to experience what's going on right now must be like really incredible to witness.

Speaker 7:          02:26:06       Well there's a group that he is actually opposed to, there's a group that identifies itself as the somethings and they are an international web of hackers that get off on doing it. And they've done every talking about low sec, is that what it's called? That's one of them. There's a sec. Yeah. And he came out against anonymous because he, for him cracking the codes was about the science. It was about the art of doing it. And these guys are much more into sabotage. They have a political agenda, you know, they, they out corporations and they blackmail them. And so, um, you know, the bottom line is you're never going to get the talent on the payrolls that is going to be out there because they're independent minded people. There antiestablishment people they don't want, they don't want to be in a payroll because they don't, they don't wanna be told what to do.

Speaker 7:          02:26:54       They offer, they offer this guy a job and he went to Microsoft or one of those big companies for like six months. They basically wanted them off the streets. They wanted them in house and he just got bored and he fucking left. Well that was the, the, the big issue was that why did the FBI have these 14 million ios users information? Why they have that on their laptop. That's like what, how much to what extent is spying already going on, on almost every American civilian. Cause it's probably gotten pretty fucking crazy now. Do you feel like when you're making a text message that you're sending it to the government as well? Eh, cause I saw my Dick, they've seen me talk about fucking farts a, I mean like what? I'm not worried about anything. I understand that you're not worried about it, but do you understand that giving people that kind of access to information is not, it's not cool.

Speaker 7:          02:27:43       The more they, why should we agree that they should be the ones who are allowed to look at all this stuff and be fair at this data? I think that's ridiculous. It's ridiculous to allow someone to be in that sort of voyeuristic position and not, I mean look at look at anonymous or look at any of these hacking groups. They, those files when they had, when people hacked like playstation. It's something that if you were in the right circles you would be able to have that file, you know, and like you can doubt, what are you trying to say? Like it's, it's if you wanted information, like if you want it all this information, you yourself could get it right

Speaker 3:          02:28:22       now if you went online, like if you wanted all these peoples ps three names and numbers are Oh Ios, six informations, you know the FBI got an online also, you know there was what your sites

Speaker 2:          02:28:35       download all this information off of this torrent websites where you can download stolen formation. Real absolute. So what are these websites

Speaker 3:          02:28:44       since this FBI like guy, he could have his job, could have been like going to torrent websites and downloading shit. You know, he might have also had beauty and the beast and three d, You know, on his, on his laptop. You know, who, who knows, who cares? I mean like if they're going to single you out, they, they're going to single you out.

Speaker 2:          02:29:03       Absolutely appreciate your, um, you're not wanting to get upset at the experience and like, who gives a fuck? I'm not doing anything wrong. But the real problem is you give people too much power and they fucking abuse it. And that's why there's all these psychological, like fail safes that are set up in door system that, you know, you're not supposed to have too much power. It's supposed to be like a whole checks and balances system. Make sure that people don't get out of hand because they do naturally. And if someone all of a sudden can check your phone, someone all of a sudden can read all your emails, they're going to,

Speaker 3:          02:29:31       yeah. And the bottom line is right now that seems safe because there's no imminent threat, but you see a guy like Rick Perry become president and load up the fucking FBI and CIA, they're going to go, we want the Christian values protected in this country and they're going to start going after the guys that put their dicks online and you're going to be fucking, you know, I'm not going to be rounded up. You're good. They're going to on a miss his way more intelligent than the government and they're hackers are way better than shit will take over.

Speaker 2:          02:29:59       Eventually happen. It's a fascinating idea. The idea that the civilization will be taken over through the inlet and that the Internet is because everything is going to be run through the Internet. They would figure out some way of having a constantly changing code that you can never crack and they use it to just manipulate wealth. And then if you, as long as you keep your shit together, they keep everything running smooth.

Speaker 3:          02:30:20       Yeah. But look what we did. Look I Israel did to Iran's Internet, you know, they fucking blew it up. They were able to crack every, you know, and we're talking about the most intense firewalls that that could be put up by, you know, a pretty wealthy country. I ran and they got in there and they fucking destroyed everything. And I think you're right, there's gotta be a fail safe in place for every country and an overall scheme. I mean, there's no way somebody who's not had the foresight to put that stuff in. It's kind of

Speaker 2:          02:30:53       kind of amazing when you stop and think about the ultimate goal of all this stuff is to connect us all on some really fucking strange way.

Speaker 3:          02:31:01       No,

Speaker 2:          02:31:01       the ultimate goal of all this technology technologies that there's not going to be any privacy in a decade. The one exist. That'd be something that we look back on when we were kids.

Speaker 3:          02:31:09       You're going to be able to go, I want to rent this six foot like room or whatever, uh, two years ago at three 15, seven, you know, uh, here's

Speaker 6:          02:31:20       the date. You're gonna be able to take the date, the time and go, I want to see video and hear sound of what happened in that room. You will be,

Speaker 1:          02:31:28       I bet eventually will be. Well you know the idea that has been proposed is that if you get a computer that's strong enough and wrap your head around this because it was really hard to fucking absorb that. If you get a computer that's strong enough to record everything that has happened in this world, like every person that exists in this world, every business has been created and put all of this into a data bank and extrapolate over a period of no more than you know, x amount of days or hours did. If this computer with given enough data, giving the, the knowing the characteristics of all these people, which eventually there'll be no room, there'll be no limitations when it comes to processing power and no limitations when it comes to storage space. You literally will be able to store everything that ever happens and that this computer would just, a few weeks of data might be able to go backwards mathematically and tell you the absolute accurate origins of life on earth.

Speaker 1:          02:32:27       That it might literally by studying things, not just on a physical level, but like on a subatomic level, that this might be enough information that they could figure out pretty accurately what happened. Like how a human being even came from the primordial slime. How it got to be a human I give it might be able to show you the, you know, the, the birth of culture and it might be able to show you with a, with a supercomputer, like what's caused all of this? Like what, how did this start caused that and that cause this, like it might be something that you could figure out mathematically.

Speaker 6:          02:32:58       Well, what's amazing is that how slow evolution is. I mean, you, people think physical. I mean, physical evolution takes so long. You, you can't even wrap your head around the amount of time that it would take for hair to not grow on your nose. You're talking fucking millions of years of time for shit to really happen. So it's, you

Speaker 1:          02:33:17       know what's crazy? Not always man. One of the things that they're finding out is it. In some instances it takes place much quicker than they expected. Like in the Congo, the Congo is a rare spot because it used to be grasslands, but then it became a rain forest pretty quickly and a lot of animals got trapped that our grasslands, animals like a antelopes and stuff, they got trapped in the Congo and some of them learn how to fucking swim. There's a animal that's an antelope, I think it's called a Diker and it's swims and eats fish. They can go under water a hundred yards. I mean, it's fucking crazy. This is an antelope man. I mean it's adapted and evolved and if you look at all of the animals that exist, there's a BBC Congo documentary that have a a brought up before. If you could find it online, get it. It's fucking sensational. It just shows you all the freaky shit that's in the Congo, the birds and the lizards and the fucking, the fish that come out of the water and walk to the next part and jump in. I mean that's fucking nuts man. That's, it's, it's a really, really weird spot in this world.

Speaker 2:          02:34:18       And what's this thing right now it's just called Congo. It's a BBC documentary on the Congo. But these fucking things of this has only happened over like a couple thousand years. And so they wonder like when did this antelope starts swimming and eating fish? Like before it was out a little like, almost like a little tiny deer running around, but now it's eating fish. Like what the fuck man,

Speaker 6:          02:34:37       can you wonder? Like, you know, they got that nuclear power plant down the coast here and they talk about the changes in the fish around there. Cause there's a certain amount of heat that emanates from the power plant into the ocean. And they say that there's been a change in, uh, the looks of some of the fish. Jesus Christ, a nice dinner.

Speaker 2:          02:34:55       I was wondering what, what happens if you eat? I mean, if I think it'd be really bad for the fish to get all of that radio activity, but how bad is it for you to eat like a radioactive halibut?

Speaker 6:          02:35:06       Well, that's why they say don't eat all fish. Don't eat fucking stuff. He, he fished it lives and dies very quickly because the longer they're around, the more they're, they're taking in, um, talk. What is it? Yeah, but specifically what's the metal that you are snakes. One of them? No. Um, mercury. Mercury. Yeah. The longer they live, the more mercury goes in their system.

Speaker 2:          02:35:27       I had a, I tested for high levels of arsenic from eating too many sardines. No Shit. Yeah. I used to like to eat sardines. I see him like Canada and sometimes to casting. How would you say? Disgusting. But I enjoyed it. I smelled it. I tried to make me feel bad.

Speaker 6:          02:35:40       Donald's breath went where

Speaker 2:          02:35:48       I did. Rosie O'donnell's a TV show. Ship TV shot. Oprah's network firewall. Yeah. Yeah. How was it? Sri? Nice. Yeah. Yeah. She'd nice. Give me a big hug and everything. She's into conspiracy theories. She just had a Hershey, oh yeah. Huge. Yeah. She likes to talk nine 11. She likes to talk. She's got some points. He's got some valid points. Hey, I respect that she didn't send up any, a Wacko radar on my side. You know, I'm all, I'm a one of those guys that, uh, I'll, I'll listen to anybody, anybody telling any crazy conspiracy theory. I'll listen, you know, for the most part. But I know when people are just like really reaching and she wasn't, she's, but she's, you know, she was on that show with like Elizabeth handful back cause like they're really hot. Chick is like Super Republican and they would go to war about, you know, like tower seven and nine 11 conspiracies and

Speaker 6:          02:36:32       yeah. And she also said some shit and she defend, uh, uh, what's his name? Mel Gibson. Mel. She really, she said, I forget, not a full on the fence, but sort of like way more than he should have gotten. Like, but here's the thing about, I think being somebody who is an alternate, an alternate lifestyle person, right, is that you have to depart from the status quo to be who you really are. And I think with that, you get some clarity and some truth in your life that you can apply to other things, conspiracy theories or whatever. Cause she's, she's different. So I think once you're labeled different, frees you in a way

Speaker 2:          02:37:11       that's interesting. Yeah. Well, she doesn't have to conform. And she's a big lesbian. Everybody knows who's a lesbian. She's powerful. She's got a lot of money. Chicks Schleicher she gets hot chicks. It's kind of a, it's a tricky situation. He, Brian did we freeze up? She shows him I'm frozen up. Okay. Just came back when I asked you your video. That's Voodoo. Yeah. We were frozen for a lot of people. Watch the video. I don't know that was many. Um, we just, we, it's probably, we would do way better if we didn't even have it.

Speaker 3:          02:37:37       Do you? Sure. I just released a podcast that was audio only, Olive Garden podcasts. It's called ready of garden butthole. That's kind of olive garden, but that's the name of the podcast and we actually recorded live at the olive garden. It's pretty stupid. They let you do it. We had a show the other day and these people brought Brian breadsticks from the Olive Garden Olive Garden bag. It's becoming the most ridiculous repetitive job. It's so silly. But by the way, how awesome was that fucking show? Oh, amazing. Both Friday and Saturday night with Doug. Stan hope and, and Joey Diaz and Ari.

Speaker 2:          02:38:12       So much fun. We uh, we were supposed to do shows in Vegas and I was supposed to have a UFC in Vegas, but the flight got canceled so we moved it to the Ice House that you, do you go up there much besides a, when you do my shows or do you have to do weekends there? I've never done it in my life. God loved God. So one of the best clubs ever. It's so perfect. It's just such an old seasoned place short. It's fucking like really low ceiling. Like really tight, tight slide. Perfect. Perfect. I did this. I did some sort of a show. I think George Lopez hosted it in 1994 those are the first time I ever went to the ice house. Oh wait. It was at any force on him? What will you six TV for for awhile. Damn, he was, he was 20 and I was on stage at the Ice House doing some TV show.

Speaker 2:          02:39:00       Yeah, I did the show. I think George Lopez wasn't he the host of it? Very Latino club too, isn't it? Not Anymore. Now we white eat up. Why did the shit out of it? Yeah, it's still a lot of Latino's. Yeah. That area has got a lot of light to San Jose, but we brought in a lot of white boys, a lot of white kids. Just, they said that there's a totally different vibe to the club now since we've been doing a lot of shows there, which is great. You know, the, the waiters and the people that work there always complimenting the audiences and stay on that. Yeah. We, we bring in a nice group of people. We're, we're super lucky and don't think that we don't appreciate the fuck out of that because I know people that are scared of their audiences and they don't want to hang out with their audience. They run from them. You know, it's nice that uh, you know, like after the show is when we're always there talking. I mean we've, we've had many nights where we stay till one 30 then

Speaker 3:          02:39:50       no, I remember the lashline he stood out there and they, it was really nice and orderly. They sorta like people lined up, they came in, took a picture, said hello.

Speaker 2:          02:39:58       Yeah, we just said, but there was a lot of it is cool conversations too. Like the guy who I told you, the Iraq guy who told me, uh, you know, about going over there and flooding the economy with money. He told me the whole really interesting thing cause he was just a young kid or would just fucking fucked up and joined and areas and this crazy false pretest. But he was talking about how he was there and he was like, you know, talking to someone who is like a sergeant. Some guy had been there for awhile and saying, well, you know, we're over here to, uh, you know, fight for freedom and all that stuff. And the guy goes, what the fuck are you talking about? He goes, well, he had to get oil. And he was like, what? Let's, yeah, we're here for the oil. We've got to control the oil. That's why we're here. They built a Po, a pipe from Kosovo. They already prepared for this. And he was like, what? And he remembers, you know, talking about like, he was talking to him about how he remembers that. That was just like a shattering moment in his life. But he was like, Holy Shit, this isn't a movie like this, this, this is crazy. He volunteered for some nutty ass fucking war.

Speaker 4:          02:40:56       Well, every fucking war man, every war that we've ever fought, there's been another reason.

Speaker 2:          02:41:01       Yeah. But that one, you know, especially the people that joined after nine 11, there's a lot of people that join that really thought they were going to do a difference. They really thought they were going to go straight fucking war hero style and reclaim America. Yeah, but don't you think that's true? Every, every war we've gotten it to pretty much a, sorry, except Vietnam. I think the reason why they had a drag people in Vietnam was because Vietnam was like super unpopular war that we would probably never could get off today. It just with the, with the Internet, you wouldn't be able to pull off that sort of Gulf of Tonkin incident. They would have to actually have a real event. Really. But they've done that before, man. You know, Hitler did that. Nero did that.

Speaker 4:          02:41:37       Oh yeah. The whole thinking of Alicia Tanea they see something that happened 22 months before we declared war. That was it. That was just an excuse we use because we were in emerging nation. We want it to be one of the big boys and it was this war going on and we said, fuck, if Germany wins, we've been supplying, we were making a ton of money supplying the, uh, the allied forces and if they lost, we were never going to get day old as fuck and billions in debt. They lost. We weren't getting that money. We went in there to hedge our bets and make sure that it went the right way. So we pretended the Lusitania was the reason we were gone in a bunch of Americans were on a ferry ship that got sore. Let's get in there and they played it played on the heartstrings

Speaker 2:          02:42:19       well before drones and missiles and high speed Aircrafts and all the shit that we have today, you had to use strategy to win a war and strategy, much like in chess involves sacrifice, okay? And there's no way to win a war if you're not willing to sacrifice some of your troops. And unless you understand that you're going to be a shitty general and you're going to make even more people die, okay? So the realities of war dictate that you do something unbelievably horrific and make sure that a certain amount of your people die.

Speaker 4:          02:42:52       Now, the final words said by Marlon Brando, he says, do you think we're going to win this war? And he goes, we came in and we vaccinated a bunch of kids who, who would, uh, who had been infected their arms or their legs have been infected with gangrene or whatever. And we inoculated them and the tribal elders came back and when they found out we'd done it date machete and off the limbs of all the children. And that's when, that's when Marlon Brando went. He's like, that's how you win a war when you're willing to do that.

Speaker 1:          02:43:20       You win the war. Yeah. You gotta be willing to take shit to the very, very highest human level. And that includes doing horrific things to your enemy. I mean, if you've read the accounts of what the American soldiers did to American Indians, native Americans, when they were trying to clear out land, they did some horrendous thing that would wear like women's vaginas on their hats. Condom out. Yeah. These are American soldiers. Yeah. There's a lot of accounts to that kind of shit. What is like hairpieces just put it on their hat, you know, like they have a fucking cowboy hat on. Just stick a woman's pussy to their hat that they cut off of an Indian that they butchered out who are like native American. I should say that. The word fake mustaches. Well I got, I got into this, uh, this weird sort of uh, native, uh, American fascination thing for a while and I was reading like a lot of shit about how, just the different ways that the, the, the, the people that migrated here, it started just killing them. Like how like these people had no idea what the fuck was coming. I mean it's a really, an incredible amount of people were wiped out over a short period of time and it doesn't get nearly the amount of attention and respect like in our culture does, is it deserves, yeah, slavery gets a lot more cause it was like just before we kind of like stopped that sort of at the same time. But you know, it's really in a horrific thing when you really stop and look at the actual numbers of people that died.

Speaker 4:          02:44:49       People look at the Germans and they still got, you know, the stigma of the Nazis. In 10 minutes, we'll stay with the Germans forever. But what you don't look at is, you know, what Great Britain did around the world, whether you're talking about Africa, Asia, India, you know what they, the amount of people that died in the name of manifest destiny or Christianity, you know, the British are truly the per capita have committed more atrocities than any race in history. And yet wasps in this country, it doesn't get any better. They are the most heralded. There's no, there's no racist jokes about the British except her teeth. Yeah. That's it. That's not bad.

Speaker 1:          02:45:29       Not Bad at all. It's truly giant to a big vaginas. Yeah. Cause they have bigger heads so that their babies are, have bigger heads. Wow. I didn't hear that park. But yeah, it's, well, what's really incredible is that we're the byproduct of all that craziness. All the raping and pillaging and sword fighting and shit. It's all come to, you know, native Americans being killed and people tracking across it and boom, here we are. I mean we're at the very end of the time, we're at the west coast of California, the United States. The last spot that people settled in the free world. This is the new world's final chapter. I mean, if you really stop and think about it, there's no, unless Antarctica defrost, we start moving

Speaker 7:          02:46:10       cities up there. But if that becomes like the new cool place, like the perfect weather to Greenland, you know, all of a sudden Greenland became, no, Iceland became the place because it warmed the fuck up and they rent. There's hot chicks and everybody went. It became like the fastest growing economy in the world for a while. Call accept the fact that this whole planet spins in a weird way and it goes through cycles where shit gets really fucking cold and when that happens in your spot, you got to move. You can't be, we can't be like completely dedicated to one spot. It's ridiculous because you look at the history of the world, they find these mega don teeth in Montana, these giant shark teeth from his fucking 80 foot long monster sharp. They used to live, they find them in Montana. That means Montana was the ocean.

Speaker 7:          02:46:59       Like you can't just say, oh, you can't goes away. It's going to get you. You got it. You can't, if you're living in Malibu, you're living in a fucking dream. Okay. Cause people that live like on the water, good luck. Good call. You're at the edge. Are you that confidence that the edge is going to stay there? Do you put your finger right near a fan every day? That's what I done living in la though. Oh yeah, you're right. I mean in a certain extent, but I think that if the real, the real thing happens like that, like something that the water comes this far in, you know, we're dead. We're already dead. Well you look at down in Mexico at Easter and we were in south of can't coon that whole, that whole area. Yeah, exactly. That shit was, you know, we go into snow days and you go down a hundred feet and they're showing you in the caves.

Speaker 7:          02:47:49       All of these fucking, you know that the ocean, basically, there was a tsunami that landed on that area and it took thousands of years for the water to drain through that land again. And it was just, it was fucking underwater there. They're finding hundreds of cities in Europe and in the, in the oceans. They're finding the remanence is on a constant basis. I'm like, uh, uh, you know it's happening. I said hundreds, but it's really been dozens, but it really has been like super frequent that they're finding more and more of these ancient civilizations that are underwater. It's just going to happen. It's just what it is. The, the, the earth doesn't give a fuck about you remember that you used to be the whole thing of like there's the lost city of Atlanta. It's like now there's about a thousand of them. There's places that went underwater. There's so much underwater shit.

Speaker 7:          02:48:33       There's, I mean, and by the way, how much shit is underwater. I mean like what do you get like 10,000 years for the ocean changes it. Well, you can never recognize it again. How long does it actually stay with all those waves and shit happening? How long before that stuff was unrecognizable roads, sand and covered in sand and shit. Fucking many sea ships are out there. What a terrifying way to die. That must've been getting a boat, hit an iceberg and then realize you are just fucking days by boat from anywhere out in the middle of the I do it. I

Speaker 4:          02:49:08       went, I was boogie boarding yesterday and I went too far out and big fucking waves. So I get fucking slam first. I'm going under these giant waves. I mean these are like seven foot waves and I start going under them and then, which you normally can do, but then it was fucking sucking me and I'd spin. So I do it like three or four times and I'm trying to go out past the waves so that I can get my air cause I ain't getting in. I look out when I'm fucking like 50 yards out and I just start. So then I finally catch one and take it a little bit and then I go under, flipped around and now I can touch the sand. But the waves are still fucking giant and so they're landing on me and I can't get under the wave. So it's fucking hitting the into the sand and spinning me and I can't get out.

Speaker 4:          02:49:52       So long story short, I finally fucking just scramble and there's a lifeguard waist deep coming at me and he's like, dude, you are right. It's like you got fucking pounded. And the thing is my wife, there's a whole bunch of people watching my family, all my friends and shit and they're like, were you scared? And I was like, I didn't have time. It never occurred to me because I'm sure it's like when you fight, if you stop and are scared for a second, you just lost your fucking ability to problem solve. And then my back is on fire today and I realize how fucked up I got. Well the only way to stop that feeling is to get over it. No, I mean that feeling being in water and just getting tossed and like it's just socks.

Speaker 2:          02:50:32       So if you haven't had an experience like that where you have to really operate under extreme pressure, it can be really debilitating. Some people just immediately give up. It gets really scary where some people find like surprising resolve and it's a weird thing about human beings, like how much your, your mind is capable of doing five minutes, but people are one way or the other.
