Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Yeah, oh, you dirty bitches with live. This is a woman playing the background. It's a band called honey honey and it's the song's called the angel of death. I'm in love with this chase voice. I heard this like an hour ago. Somebody posted on my message board and then I just listened to it and I've listened to like 10 times such as such a pitch. I'm such a bitch for like a hot girls voice, a girl with a beautiful voice man. There's like a weird harmony that it connects to in inside yourselves. You know? I don't think I bet women to understand it. You know? I don't know. I don't even know. I don't even think this chick knows what she's doing. She knows how to do it though, but the, the impact that it has on the male standing, the Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by the flashlight.

Speaker 1:          00:00:53       If you go to Joe Rogan.net and click on the link for the flashlight and into her in the codename Rogan, you'll get 15 percent off. Number one sex toy from her. There's no other way to say that. I got to come up with a better way, Brian. I got to come up with something creative that have been there. Yeah. They've been saying they'll help you get you one. Do you want one? I'm missing out on life otherwise. So if you want one dude, I got one for you. I, I, they just sent me a big buck

Speaker 2:          00:01:15       and I brought one for studio flashlight and it lasted less than 24 hours. I brought it here and I was just going to use it. Just show it you just in case people ask about flashlight because everyone always asks about what, what's, Hey, what's this? And so I had it for less than 24 hours and was like, dude, please can I have one sea herring?

Speaker 1:          00:01:31       Uh, so. So see stole your flashlight. I gave it to him, gave it to him. He's fucking right now.

Speaker 2:          00:01:36       Probably. Yeah, I gave him the black

Speaker 1:          00:01:38       model. One, two. Nice. Well look man, it works. Solid product. We wouldn't doors it less. It was good. It's a funny thing to get behind. You know, people, people find it very offensive and pathetic and juvenile. And I'm not sure, but I like it. I liked the fact that people are bothered by it and it's so stupid. It just highlights how fucking ridiculous we are. Completely ridiculous that we would care at all about pleasure. You know, that we care at all about like a device. It's really good at extracting sperm. That's all it is. You know, what's your fucking problem? People were also brought to you by [inaudible] Dot Com, o n n I t, makers of Alpha brain, the cognitive enhancement supplement. I didn't take mine today. I hope I don't sound stupid. Got Some right here. If you want to hook a brother up, I would say a Nigga, but I'm not that confident.

Speaker 1:          00:02:29       Beautiful. Um, if you go to on it.com, o n n I, t, all of this will be explained. What it is is essentially nutrients for your mind. It's not gonna make you a genius if you're a retard, but it's going to enhance the way your brain works, going to give you. It gives you like a feeling of mental clarity and energy. Um, there's a lot of people that don't understand. Nootropics are, they don't know what new nootropics are. I suggested you as Google. It's an Oh, new tropics, and it's all about vitamins and nutrients that help your brain function at a good level. And um, you know, there's plenty of studies that had been done on this and you should research it before you buy any of this stuff. Also, I want to say that if you, if you see on its products and you want to try it, you're not sure if it's gonna work for you.

Speaker 1:          00:03:18       You don't know, try it. The first 30 pills are 100 percent money back guarantee. If you don't like it, we want to make it as easy as possible for you so you even have to send the stuff back. If you try it and you don't feel like it has any effect on you, then send, send the pills back or d or excuse me, don't even send the pills back. You don't have to do shit. You just get your money back. Uh, used to be with as many as people ordered. But unfortunately a bunch of people decided to just buy a bunch of it. Get all their money back and then sell it on Ebay.

Speaker 3:          00:03:46       That old story. It's not even a story. It's a fable. It's a true story and it's their story though. I've sounded it so many times. That's the problem, but it is always ultimately true. It's a fairytale. You think so now it's fairy because patrols, if I've said it too many times, it's become. It's become like not real anymore. Yeah, you're right. It does. It changes a little bit every time. Like you know.

Speaker 1:          00:04:06       Well they did. They bought a bunch of them. They bought like nine owners and they sold them on Ebay. That's the story. That's all I know though. Dude. I don't know. Next weekend is going to be Amazon marketplace too. I didn't make this up, man. Don't be an asshole trying to do a little commercial here. You're going to help him. Brian. We're also a. We make a shroom tech sport, which is a quarter step mushrooms, a supplement. It's got beat 12 in it too. It's great for any, any really, really hard workout people if you're in the crossfit or anything crazy like that. It's a. it's a great endurance enhancement supplement, really helps you push into points where you would ordinarily be fatigued. You know, I don't. I wouldn't suggest any of this if you're not someone who works out though. There's also shroom, tech, immune, all this stuff, if you're fascinated by it, a far better description than I could ever give is on [inaudible] dot com.

Speaker 1:          00:04:56       That's o n n I, t and M. There's also a, an enhanced science of Alpha brain where we've updated due to some criticisms updated. We hired a science advisor and updated the way everything is described and everyone's trying to be as above board and cooled this as possible. So that's what it is. If you're fascinated by nootropics, go to [inaudible] dot com. O n n I t enter in code named Rogan. You get 10 percent off, not just the first order either. Now it's as many orders as you want. We fixed that shit. Alright. Powerful. Daniella boat. At least in the house.

Speaker 4:          00:05:39       You're like a 12 year old DJ. That's like the kind of like sound effects. I would be really interesting.

Speaker 3:          00:05:49       I was a Dj and I was 12. Yeah. Or it sounds like a sports broadcast, you know, like this week.

Speaker 4:          00:05:55       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:06:00       A lot of those sports guys are hard to handle. Intense. Yeah. With this special breed of guys that like shit on athletes, you know, there's like some of them that are just sports broadcasters, but some of those dudes like they do. Um, and then the like he's a bomb. He's always been a bomb. He'll never get off the bench and you're like, whoa. Like you're talking about like a professional athlete. Their son, you better settle the fuck down man. You're getting a little crazy with your insults, their fat guy in front of a microphone. How dare you, you know, I like that insult shit. Right? Daniella Bolelli my friend or shut up. Exactly. So brother, you are a scholar of religious history, right? I mean you are essentially. Why not? Yeah, I mean that's the best way to describe it. You are actually a professor on it.

Speaker 1:          00:06:48       Yup. How do you think that it is that we live in 2012 and we have this incredible depth of religion. It's still controlling our lives. How is it possible that something that seemed so like it, it seems so if you were rationally looking at it, you would go, okay, maybe there's some truth behind any of this. Maybe, maybe, maybe there's some truth behind the origins of the creation of the universe, but clearly this shit has been written by people and we're going to base our lives on this. This is fucking bananas. People when they say base our lives, most people will say they do, but then of course when it's convenient, when it's not, it's like, let's conveniently forget a couple of passages. Like there's um, but aren't those the safest ones? The ones that stick to the code, those are the most danger. The ones that want to throw rocks at you, like dancing a Christian girl who slept around every now and then.

Speaker 1:          00:07:50       You know what I mean? That's like way better. I've seen someone who completely stick to the code. Yeah. No, but I mean several of the sinks are because they boiled it down to wheat or now the type of questions that no one has an answer to and sort of fact these, unless you know, people always say, oh, it's good already in decades we go for science and reason and we need to be irrational and don't get me wrong. Give me a reason why he's a great tool, but if it doesn't give you answers to things that scare the hell out of people, people are going to want some answers. Whether they are bullshit dancers or not, doesn't matter. It's like, give me some answer because otherwise it's just damn scary. His religion than a tool to allow people to psychologically adapt to the next stage of evolution. Like, like something like a placeholder. Yeah, I mean I think it's what people need to deal with. The fact that I can't deal with uncertainty. Is it possible at all that any of it is based on reality? I mean know that so it sounds ridiculous, but so does the universe itself, like the universe itself is pretty ridiculous. The Big Bang is pretty ridiculous. I don't claim to know shit, so who knows what's up there. I, I don't believe or disbelieve, you know, my

Speaker 5:          00:08:56       attitude is there's what I've experienced and there's every single house. Yeah. What I've experienced, I kind of know. And every single males who the hell knows, you know, I mean it pissed me off when people assume that stuff, that they themselves as an Evan expedience somewhere that's the ultimate truth and everybody needs to believe that. It's like, what the hell? Why? How nuts would it be if you died and you really were at a date in the cloud, how psychedelic would that be if you really did have a dude, St Peter who's like the FBI who's just been following your license, you're a baby and he's like going over day, why'd you do this and why'd you do that? Like fucking really. That would really, that would wearing a mom and she. Can you imagine, what does that really stand for something though? I mean, I wonder if that ideal that this ideal of, you know, having to live like a Karma free life and having to like have done only good things only be pure and then you get to um, a moment.

Speaker 5:          00:09:57       I mean, is that what they're, are they envisioning a moment of ultimate enlightenment? When you're framing what is the idea of, you know, of, of the heaven, like where's it coming from? Is it coming from the need for the next level? We're the, the possibility. What would be the best possible scenario? The best possible scenarios. All loved ones would be in the clouds forever and ever. But really, how fucking long would that last before you were bored as fuck. But you imagine if that's heaven, you're just hanging out in the clouds. You can't drive anywhere. You can't go to the movies. Everybody's up together and having, what the fuck is that? That's ridiculous. No flashlights were. We all have wings now, so we just fly around up here. You know, what do we do after a while? You get bored. Where are you getting your food?

Speaker 5:          00:10:43       You're in the clouds, you know, you eating fucking cloud fish. What are you doing? Where are you getting your food? This is ridiculous. We don't need food anymore. Oh my God. What is there to live for? That would be my question. Are their flashlights in Africa? Can you fucking have it? How about that? How about that question? You know, you fucking heaven. If there was heaven, would you be allowed to? So what if it was just like a smoker? Replace. The whole thing was just smoke here. You know, like you're like, you're not allowed to smoke, you know, all the time. So like you can have full relationships and get girls pregnant. You can still get a driver's license, but everything's just really smokey. Yeah, that sounds. That makes sense. But fucking talks because you're in heaven. It's all cloudy clouds. So it's like real life book Seattle, like maybe hit Seattle. Seattle. Exactly sucked.

Speaker 4:          00:11:34       I'm definitely going to vegas. Oh Wow. Vegas.

Speaker 5:          00:11:39       Vegas is some sort of purgatory. No, that's definitely. Oh, it's like in their logo. State motto.

Speaker 4:          00:11:47       Hi. I think it is. Well, you know what? There's about the

Speaker 5:          00:11:54       human behavior man, when you get them in that frying pan frying pan. That is Las Vegas, you know, I hate it now. I just don't even want to go there. I just went two days ago and Jesus just that drive there. I was like, fuck, I forgot how bad it is, but it's fun to. As it is, it's the best place to go see fights. It's like no other place. Like it's going to the best club, like a bar one night and then you're hanging out there for a couple of days. Yeah, it's, it's a weird town. I like Vegas. There's a lot of things I like about. There's plenty of cool people in Vegas, you know? It's just the reality is when you get people and you just let them go free like that. Do you give them 24 hour free rein, go drink and you just wind up doing ridiculous shit.

Speaker 5:          00:12:39       That's what I need though because you see these people that are doing or why do we know this sheets and you know that they are the ones who are at 9:00 AM at tie. Then I'm like, this is the current, Florida's lave is the. I know it must be a fucking grind and try to go back to work after a weekend of that, but people who lived there, man, they must get an extraordinary view of humanity. They have like, they would be like great psychologists. People live in Vegas. They probably understand a lot about people. You know, if you work at a casino, say if feel like some dude, you could be like a guy who's like a real crafty dude who lives in vegas, could really describe humanity in a very unusual level. Probably know any of the show and just see them at their real estate.

Speaker 5:          00:13:25       Just the idea that you would get people and allow them to drink through all hours of the night thinking, drink whenever they want. Like nobody ever tells you to stop drinking. It's so ridiculous that just drinks it, that you need a drink. Like why are you can still drink. This is crazy. It's just that alone is nuts. You know, we're just a note. No one's used to that shit. So that's. So that's a weird thing. Alcohol removes inhibition and then you have. So it's like just that alone is what makes Vegas fucking completely insane. I mean, you wanted freedom. Here you go. You got it. Let's see how it goes. That is. Dan was the first time that I actually was anywhere rather than on the street. I was like, Whoa, there are actually people living here. It is. This weird filter was just an adult.

Speaker 5:          00:14:05       He's not on there. So I'd love it though. I love the fact that there's is a place like that. I love the fact that there's a place where people can gamble. I don't even gamble, but I love that you could just go gamble at 3:00 in the morning. I don't do it, but if I was into it, I would love the fact that I could just do that. You know? I just, I hate the fact that you can't, you know, you have to go somewhere for something like that. You know that we restrict that sort of behavior everywhere else that's big enough that our lead Gen is one other thing that pissed me off the most because I mean people being religious, I have nothing against it. If it, if it helps you being nicer to your neighbors or whatever. Good for you. The stamina piece me off to no end is when they want to impose their own morality on you and so the victim of this crime slow, you know, no gambling, no show, no drugs,

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       no. But is there a positive message in trying to control some vices? I mean, is there a. is there anything that you could say as far as like social engineering, like man, if you wanted to have a really safe environment, maybe what'd you make? Prostitution illegal. Would you make drugs illegal? Would you try to suppress it or would you do. Do you think that the safer thing would be to just decriminalize it and let people figure it out for themselves? Mediamath regulation. I'm kind of like the way that the dam or something. Yeah, exactly. Where do you have some safety standards is good for everybody involved. You limit the damage that people can do to themselves and to others that, hey, it's your choice. Which our life. Yeah, that's weird thing, man, isn't it? It's a weird thing, but just the idea that you can control what other people do, but only to a certain extent.

Speaker 1:          00:15:43       Like we don't say that we can control porn yet. Although there was a thing about Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum, all of them are going to go after porn. Was that who it was? It was that. It was at least two of those characters we're going to go after porn I think was gingrich and Santorum. I don't think about. Not that it makes much difference because those guys are, you know, different shades of gray. But man, it's so weird the now anyone on or could devote for Santorum scare the shit out of me. A lot of people are voting for him. They love this guy. What do you think they're connecting to? I mean, you as a person who, I mean, he's obviously the message, uh, quite a bit of it is that is religious.

Speaker 5:          00:16:26       I mean that kind of stuff you'd boys down to somebody will give you the image of what you would want to have. We are, we promote all the good guys will, uh, be rewarded old. The bad guys will be pioneers. We stand for morality, we squash anything else. And the thing that makes some of these people feel good is we'll squash every one else who doesn't agree with living life the way we do so we can impose our happy dog mountain of anyone else because that ultimately is the kind of shit that he stands for. And it's a, people like it. I mean, he's not just 30 Joanie. If you look even outside of early John People voted for a color, you know, it's not, it wasn't just purely taking power. People like Nazism, people like the hardcore form of communism, people like, they like certainties. They like somebody with least puts up a strong face and is like a stand for all of this volume of solid, clean know that shit. Then simplify life. And that's scary to me. It's really scary. Yeah. Big Time because uh, I mean it's not real. It's based on a,

Speaker 1:          00:17:29       it's based on numbers. Yeah. And he must have a belief. You must have a belief. I mean, there's no way he could be talking this much if he doesn't have a belief, but anybody who believes something that they can't really prove and believed it to a point where they're willing to base their lives on it like that.

Speaker 6:          00:17:47       And, and you want

Speaker 7:          00:17:50       just run the biggest nuclear arsenal in the world. Really? Look what, look what you're banking on. Look, look what liquid corner you're in. You're in the corner of fire and brimstone for real. Yep. You're in the corner of gays. Shouldn't be allowed to get married. And like, what? What are you doing in 2012? Why do you want to give a fuck about what gay guys are doing? Your Weirdo. What kind of Weirdo gives a fuck about what some gay guys are doing? Like, oh, we have to stop that. Birth control is bad. Yeah. Birth control is bad. Such fucking crazy. It's like he's. He's like pulling us back in the 1960 [inaudible] his birth controls. Awesome. Did you can shoot loads in a checks and I don't get pregnant. You stupid. Fuck

Speaker 3:          00:18:34       dummy. You fucking dummy. Have you ever tried the female condom on a girl? Who was that? Like a dental dam? Yeah, it's like a dental dam, but like you could just come as much as you want into her. Like it's amazing but you have to change it because it's like a vagina diaper because it gets really full. So that team that you just gave us the bus draw girl. Nobody was killed my son. Seriously? Yeah. Who's going to be all excited like my vagina diaper. It is. Guys will still fuck you if you have a diaper. We don't care. We can get over that real quick. You know, for a woman that would be a w. probably a a deal breaker. You know, he'd pull off a diaper, bunch of goobers in a bag. What if a girl got a diaper on, had shit all over it and she was really hot and you had a bunch of Napkins and some hot towels and what? You'd cleaned her ass and then her fuck. Yeah. Yeah. Wouldn't even bother you. Really hardly be like a little whatever. Just got to deal with it. Wipe her ass clean baby with big tits. But for a girl, for guy and like Shit's middle. His Dick and his pubic hair, she believed that's it. It's all women know what it nearly as much as we do. I agree. We'll clean ship. We will clean your shitty ass

Speaker 5:          00:19:47       for real. Right? That's true. I don't know why we're free. We're free gear, right? Is that in the Bible? Do you think that the Bible was initially created just to try to keep people in line? You think it was created, like look and these are some stories. This is some lessons that we've learned and then it just kinda like got out of control. Like I think it goes both ways. There's some. Sometimes you use it as a tool to control people's behavior if you feel that they are to fuck it up, but also it's an internal thing. I think he's not just a, I know this is bullshit about. I'm going to feed it to them just so I keep it a crazy scene line. I also think that sound, the people themselves who started some of these things feel needy. They desperately need it to the point where they will. They are going to be the first one to stick their own lives on it and that's I guess the Santorum thing. You know? You want to leave that way. I mean, I think our knots, but whatever. It's your life. You should be free to do whatever you want when you want to impose it on everyone else. That's when you'll piss me off. That's when it gets scary. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:20:50       Which is bizarre to me. Anybody who really absolutely believe something that much is bizarre to me. Yeah. Like why do you believe in what you. Where are you seeing this? You really believe that book Zen. What's going on? Man? This said, that's how that seems crazy, but you're banking it all in one book. There's a lot of books, man, don't let a lot of shit has been written, you know, and they're really. The shit that's the weirdest is the oldest. You can't. That's nonsense. We need like a new behavior standard guide for humans. That's what we need instead of a Bible, just a behavior standard guide so we can all get through this world like this. These are the rules that we agree to instead have bestowed upon us by a higher power. Yeah, you definitely shouldn't do most of this shit. The Bible says.

Speaker 7:          00:21:32       Tells you not to do. Don't be killing anybody. Don't fuck your neighbor's wife. All that stuff. That's all good. Yeah, you really should. That's. Those are good, but we need some more of those and we need like a comprehensive guide just based on what we all know to be. Right. We all know, I think this is the best time ever to do something like that because even though people were complaining that times are tough and unemployment is bad, and it certainly is economies and in terrible position, but still better than any time in human history. Right. There's really been no better time as far as like safety as far as like the access to get food and medicine. This if there's ever a time for us to get our shit together. Like on paper now, is it like together as like a group of humans instead of instead of bound by some crazy words that were written first in ancient Hebrew. First of all, they were. They were told as an oral tradition, Philip for thousand years first. Yet it's not for seven. Orlando, Dr Kim. Imagine what the fuck happens to a story when you tell it for hundreds of years before somebody figures out how to write things. Whoa. That's nuts. What do you think about those Dead Sea Scrolls? Do you know much about that?

Speaker 5:          00:22:48       I mean, his artist sinks. There's what are you fish? Our scriptures of every religion are one tiny part of what used to be out there, and then people, I mean you get to the kids as Afghanistan, literally, they get to vote on which books are sacred and come from God and which ones are not that mean. Can you believe that? It's like somebody's seat around the table. What it's like today, right now we pull out some book and go, okay, what do you think about it is these gods are not. Okay, next let's talk about this one. It was really that arbitrary. I mean I nearly. That's amazing. How many books were like left out? Are those available? Who knows because a lot of these.

Speaker 5:          00:23:29       This is the end, the Bible. A lot of these was because he wasn't like, oh, we decide this is God stuff and sold the other stuff. Well read it. If you want to noise like we have to burn it because it must be the Davao son, so it must be terrible and horrible and we need to squash any possible other alternative and soul that's burned them old. Wow. And so when something goes pops up that shows a different side to it that wasn't made a part of the official Canon, that it makes everybody feel like, what the hell is going on like is so we can base our life on this or can we or I mean most people are going to ignore it anyway because otherwise he masters with categories. But that's a good idea.

Speaker 5:          00:24:07       What a weird time. Yeah, I mean, thinking about like the concept of faith, the stuff that's at the basie self, uh, Judaism, Christianity, Islam, think about like the story that they own, the revere. They all think he's a great idea. You know, God the shows up that say, but um, I really think you should kill your song. And they, it's like, well, I don't want to kill my song, but you know, if it's God speaking wedding decades, sorry, bye. Come on, let's go. He's about to kill him. And then God sends an angel. Say, no, no, no, wait, just kidding. Just testing your faith. You know, just checking. You pass the test. You did very well and now you're rewarded for it. You know, last time I check when you hear these embodied voices telling you, you should kill people, least thinning to that is not what should make you the guy who everybody looks up to.

Speaker 5:          00:24:52       One thing we want a great example of faith. You analyzing what a crazy story God wants you to kill your baby. Yeah, what the fuck, and you're gonna kill your baby for God and that was the right thing to do and God said he was just testing you. Holy Shit. That's a sign. That good job you'll pass. The test is that Old Testament. The Old Testament is about as wonky as it gets, right? Predictive, but they said that the Dead Sea scrolls were even wonkier. Like you know, there's, there's a lot of dead sea scrolls stuff that hasn't even been included. That is the oldest written version, right? Jazz, because it's not part of the official cannon, doesn't mean that it's all good stuff. I think it's not like he's easy to fall into the pattern of, oh, these evil bastards a manipulated the seeings put on these horrible things in the books.

Speaker 5:          00:25:38       And so every scene that got squashed must be good. No, not really. You know, some of the stuff that got squashed, it's probably even worse. Who knows? So I love the fact that the Dead Sea Scrolls, it was always linked to crazy shit. People were always like, it's always, you have photos and mushrooms and it's like every, every wacky, crazy story is linked to the Dead Sea Scrolls, you know, even the fact they found them, you know, one of the coolest things is, uh, the science of putting together the pieces because a lot of them were in leather. One of the ways they put together the pieces, what they did, genetic testing on them to find out which ones came from the same animal. So they knew that it was a piece of one's skin. Incredible stuff, man. That's amazing. Amazing stuff. It was really incredible. And they're still putting that fucking thing together, you know, people are still trying to decipher it, which broadly over the last 2000 years.

Speaker 5:          00:26:30       And they found that banter over those things. But you know, 500 years ago somebody would have looked at it. It's like, hmm, you know, maybe I can start a fire with it or something. Yeah. When you're starving and you have to cook the book, it, it, you cook the book, you know when you need something to light a fire, you're going to fuck that book. Light it on fire. We're going to die tonight. You know, bicycling. Yeah. Fuck yeah. How much stuff was lost in the burning of the library of Alexandria, south of disordered. I mean, you're talking about thousands and thousands of volumes. It's pretty damn scary. Yeah. It's amazing to think that human beings can be so fucking creative. And then so destructive when people don't understand is there was some sort of incredibly advanced society that was, that it created ancient Egypt.

Speaker 5:          00:27:18       I mean, to this day it's a. there's a bunch of puzzles when it comes to the immense construction, the, the fact that how much just actual mass was moved the size of some of these, these, uh, old ballistics. I mean, it really is incredible society and they knew a lot of things and all of it was wiped out in a fire. And I think it was two fires. I think there was two different times they were attacked. Yeah. I'm sort of like a man. Well, how much further would we be if we knew all that Shit, you know? But it's the same kind of stuff that happened even in other places because when the Spaniards came over out here, when they conquered the aztecs and the Aztecs who are one of the indigenous people that had big lied, but our reason that books and written language and the whole thing and the Spanish approach was like, well there's these look like in the volleyball.

Speaker 5:          00:28:09       No, while, in decades. It's gonna wait, we can burn it. Burn it though. Hey, that's nice. But so if it wasn't a Bible, they just burned it bazzy. I mean, it's like your guys that are not curious, don't see. It must be devil worshipers and we shouldn't burn evidence and you have ever done because it's all crap. Did they burn and Maya and stuff? Yeah, I mean basically anything that was in mines inklings, anybody you know there's still fine in Mayan temples. That fascinates me, man. They said that they might be as many as a thousand unfound temples in South America. That's crazy. But then again, when you hike through the jungle that there are some tiny or you can see how that could be because you can't unsee it. You know what? Going to be 10 feet away and sold them a theme that you have no idea where they are.

Speaker 5:          00:28:55       Fucking incredible culture. It existed here. What a bizarre, strange culture that made these, you know, these, these cities that were aligned to like astronomical, you know, points like really amazing, like he could look the way the sun would come up through some doorways. It was like perfectly built. It's incredible. It's like the stuff that they had figured out how to do. It's like, how did you do this? This is amazing. One of the pyramid, the bottom of the pyramid, there's a gigantic store and ahead of as snake and he's like, where the hell is the body? It's like because of that one day of the year when the standardize, this eats the shade of the steps in such a way that it looks like the body's coming down here. I mean it's like, can you imagine like building that whole thing and then you have like shitty weather

Speaker 7:          00:29:42       that would really suck. Just the calculations involved. I mean it is it. Is it possible that some of them could be coincidental? I guess the snake thing could be. It's possible, but there's so many of them. There's one in the temple of Luxor. I think it is, where the light comes down this corridor and illuminates his whole room on one day of the year. No, I mean these guys were awesome because this incredible with the had figured out. They've figured out some amazing shit them in the mind. It's like so much stuff was lost in the past would have been so fascinating to really know what it would. What, what? Like how much knowledge really was around during the construction of the pyramids. I mean, what did they really know? How much? Well, how much is lost in just the sand and erosion and how much is gone and fire. What the fuck did they really know? You know, good.

Speaker 5:          00:30:37       Ninety nine percent of the human population today with modern technology and tell them. Build a pro.

Speaker 7:          00:30:42       Yeah, of course. Nobody. Yeah. Everybody liked. Makes it like it's no big deal. Canada here. It's crazy. If you were asked by just a little bit anywhere so it gets the top. It's fucked. It's amazing. And they used to be covered in smooth limestone to east to be shiny and then there was a gold cap on the top of them. God Damn. That must've been magnificent. Theater Islam. And what happened if people don't know you, look at the pyramids were they're so fucked up. That's because people stole the limestone. They chipped it off of those buildings. Those Gross, disgusting rat people chewed away at that beautiful construction, one of the most amazing things a human being has ever created and they chewed away it just pulling chunks of beautiful stone off and building their shitty houses with it. Fucking crooks, rat people. So you're in a good mood today. What kind of a human being would deface the pyramid date? There were people that did that terrible human beings. I mean, could you imagine, man, what kind of a person would fucking chew up the Pyramids and steal the stone? Jesus Christ cookies, your own limestone bench. You know? Can you make a house out of wood? Right. Even the three pigs had options.

Speaker 7:          00:32:02       They knew some shit though. Huh? That's a fact. That's what kind of religions

Speaker 5:          00:32:08       around in ancient Egypt, like what did they worship? It was all like hanging around that. Or you see the transition from tribal religions that tend to be more mad, a little flexible because they are not written down is relatively small society. So there's a lot more flexibility about the beliefs. So there are generally mystic shamanistic kind of beliefs, but then when you turned them into a big society, we like millions of people living in it. They become, you still have a lot of these traces of that stuff. It's all about spirits and these and that, but then they become much more hoodie juvenile fish. Ow there's a clergy leaders if it comes and there's the and you know. So it's kind of a more structured type of funny museum that in my mind kind of pretty much hitting mean whatever his mood about only museum to begin with. You tweeted a Robert e Dot Howard quote the other day. I love that guy. Oh, me too. When I was, when I was a kid, I was a huge. What was the exact tweet? It was a Conan quote, unquote. I forget what the hell it is, but it's basically cannon going off. Yeah. Find it because I'm about to write down their lies.

Speaker 7:          00:33:06       Yeah, it was um, cone in, in uh, it was one of A. I forget which book, but it's a famous quote. Where the fuck is it? I live, I burned with life. I love Islay and damn content

Speaker 5:          00:33:25       women are like, that's so gay for a man. You know the Sumerian culture, like what a little fucking chrom what a hard ass God he was. People don't know Robert e Dot Howard was as bad motherfucker who's an incredible author who created. He created a, what's called a conquer and Conan the barbarian. It was all these crazy fantasy books. They're amazing. They're fucking really fun to read. When I was a kid, man, I became hooked on, on the Conan novels and he was, uh, he was uh, a really nutty dude and wound up taking his own life. Right. I don't know if he's throwing out by the legend has it that he would say that I'm at night. He would see these as he would have got derrick to it, right. And suddenly he would see the shadow behind him and he wouldn't turn, but he cooked out that he was calling on Kevin and John Tax ready to shop.

Speaker 5:          00:34:17       You set off on last year, all told night. And he would stay there and like sweat that right there. Right in the morning he was gone. So he could finally sleep because I know wouldn't be back ready to shop. He said, oh wow. That was the coolest fucking character in any book ever written down. You know, the people like Conan the barbarian with Arnold Schwartzenegger. That was pretty cool and everything like that. But really the, the real. If someone got ever figured out how to do the book justice and make it really put it together, right? Like the last one was Kinda corny. The dude was pretty bad ass. He was. That dude was a good call, man. He, he seemed to me like what Kona and should look like now look great. But the screenwriting was the screen writing was bad, but he was good. His fight scenes were great.

Speaker 5:          00:35:04       He looked like Conan, you know, I think he people were hating because he's too fucking good looking. That's what it is. The dude is just way too good luck and you make students super uncomfortable. But if you, if you not a hater. I met the dude, he was super cool. And if you're not a hater, you know, look man, he got lucky. He's born six foot five fucking perfect chiseled face. You just got to deal with that bitch. You gotta deal with that. But guess what? That's what Colin and supposed to look like. That fucking guy is coming at. They just need to do it right, man. The fucking writing was all corny. Like the ending was all corny. What if like Michael Bay did it? What Dude? Yeah,

Speaker 7:          00:35:38       something like that. Or swords blowing up. Horses spinning around everybody you know who would do it right? Quintin Tarantino. It right. Tina would fucking do it. Right? He would dig into that bitch and if you can get Quintin Tarantino to direct the movie, God Damn Son. That would be bad ass. Show it.

Speaker 5:          00:35:56       It would be good magic. Get him to write it to get him to write the screenplay and put put together like one of the, one of the better books. It was so many good books too. I gotta give you. Having Tarantino would be a freaking dream, but I like, I have to say I liked the, the original Canon. Yeah. And I find it interesting that, that he's the same guy will come up with some of the concepts were UFC, you know, our old gracie said, but all over it because he wasn't one of their students of the students off the graces and he was the gracies. They had the art Davey and they were immediately as, as kind of a creative director or into the first UFC started coming up with some of the ideas that then somebody else designed for the arc that go on and all of that. And I'm like, I love that guy. He created Conan the barbarian and was at the beginning of USC. That's incredible. I didn't even know that. That's interesting. You have some UFC trivia that I didn't even know that I can go home. Satisfied now I'm, my work is done. Rampage Jackson is mad at me. Why? I don't know is an interview. Read it.

Speaker 7:          00:36:59       I was watching. I was just call me fake ass. And he was saying that shit. Really? Yeah. He was saying that all I want them to do is throw low kicks and reasoning. It doesn't throw low kicks is because he's fighting a wrestler. You dumb asses. Look, man, you know, I don't. I'd love rampage. I don't mean to be rude when I assess things. I'm just trying to objectives. Really try to figure out how this guy could be doing better than he's doing. When I look at a guy like rampage, I look at a dude with. He's fucking, first of all, one of the most exciting fighters of all time. You go back to his fights and pride like the Ricardo Arona fight or the or the, the uh, Kevin randleman knockout. Remember that? Random and knockout. God damn the slam on a roll. And I meet so many.

Speaker 7:          00:37:43       He had a great, great fucking fights in pride. Know rampage. I liked him a lot. I like him as a person. I enjoyed hanging out with them. I did a thing with him for the UFC once it was, um, there was a show that we did, I think it was called ultimately. Was it ufc ultimate inside or something like that? Is that the one we're doing now? I don't even remember the name of it. It was, it was on spike. Oh fuck. What was the name of it? You know, UFC unleashed is Michael Goldberg's. What the hell is it called? Any idea right now? Alright, what time at UFC? Whatever it was. I don't remember what it was. Um, we, uh, we drove around in his tracks. He has this giant monster truck with his face on the side of it and shit. It's fucking awesome. It's hilarious. It's all lifted and shit. And we drove around and uh, I even trained with them. We went to the gym and trained and we filmed everything. We went and got chicken

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       together and yeah, we went to popeyes. He's cool as fuck. I like them. I don't mean anything when I, what I'm trying to, like when I'm judging a fight or what not, I'm not judging a fight, but when I'm, when I'm doing commentary and a fight, all I'm trying to do is sort of objective, really assess what I think someone could be doing differently to try to get themselves out of a spot if they're not winning or you know, I'm just trying to commentate. It's not, I'm not like critiquing the guy soul, I'm not like breaking down who he is as a person. I liked the guy a lot, but even ran pitching himself admits that he was more exciting back in the day when he was in. I mean, it doesn't have to be. He's a great fighter. You can do whatever the fuck he wants.

Speaker 1:          00:39:18       One, when I'm doing what I'm doing. Commentary is just my objective opinion. That's all it is. It's not that I don't like the guy. Why do you think he stopped? Because even prior to pretty much every fight he would picked somebody up, leave them up in the air, slammed. I mean it was like he's saying, do you know he needed every fight? No facade. Then never again. I'm like, what the hell happened? I don't know. I mean he has a lot more tools now. He's, you know, it's, it's hard to tell him. Also he was finding people in a ring more. I wonder if that's different. One thing can actually be easier to pick people up in the cage because they are age would. Well He, you know, it also you could get fucking after doing that for a long time. You could get, it's possible you could hurt your back, you could have like issues like a lot of wrestlers of really powerful guys.

Speaker 1:          00:40:06       I don't know if he does, I'm just guessing. But a lot of guys eventually have like kinks in their neck and shit. Tito's had to, a disc replacement and data wasn't even lifting people up was just shooting straight, lifted some people up to. He knocked out Evan Tanner, that was with a big body slam and when he was younger he would hold these guys up a lot. You know, I think as you get older you get smarter. As you get smarter, you fight more conservatively. Right. You know, but I just wish the guy wasn't mad at me when I tell them to throw leg kicks, it's just because he has awesome leg kicks. Oh yeah. Is, you know, he's like, you know, I'm fighting a wrestler. Dumb ass. Like I know, I know I'm Dutch. I'm just saying man, he landed a few and his leg kicks are fucking bad ass. I would like to see that if I was in his corner, you know

Speaker 2:          00:40:47       when rampage is mad at you, is that something that you should be worried about? Like if you're out and you see them somewhere and you're like, oh, I would talk to him and I'd take, we'd be cool instantly.

Speaker 1:          00:40:55       I'm not a, I'm not a bad person and he's not a bad person either. He's just, he's just upset and he's sensitive and he's also got the toughest fucking job on the planet. There's a lot of pressure and a lot of stress involved in being a fighter, you know. And the last thing I want to do is add more pressure and add more stress. All I'm doing is trying to just analyzing the fight. That's all it is. It's just I have to be objective. I can't, I can't protect someone's feelings, you know, at the expense of doing what I'm supposed to be doing, which is sort of analyzing what's going on, you know? And some people say I'm biased and he was standing a bias towards Jujitsu guys because yeah, your lego second deck. That was cute. That was funny. It

Speaker 7:          00:41:34       was funny, it was good. He was animated and Shit. You know, he's, he's a funny guy, man. I like rampage. But if anything I'm more biased. I always say towards like really aggressive strikers. Like vendelay Silva is my favorite all time fighter. Rarely. Yeah, I think so. If I had to pick like one guy, like the vandelay and pride, he because he was so wild man. Just every vandelay Silva fight, you know exactly what the fuck you were getting into. It was like a Tyson fight and then that same sort of feeling. Right. You know, when he was on top, you know, when, when vandelay was just smashed and dudes, when he was at his like, he's very peak. He was so wild. Yeah. It was a wild guy to look. There was an excitement as a fan, like holy shit. You know what I mean with vandelay was gonna fight man.

Speaker 7:          00:42:17       Everybody would get hyped up and still to this day, like that commonly fight proved it. Still to this day he's got that, you know. So my all time favorite style of fighting is really not Jujitsu. I, you know, I, I liked strikers to watch, I like to, I still like watching beautiful Jujitsu technique. I absolutely do. But for the Oh shit moments for the Oh shit, like almost always chaos. It's almost hit its head kicks and Mirko Cro. Cop was like the king of the Oh shit moment. Of course, you know, his, his left high kicks and Fan Angela, you know, those are the guys that I always like really enjoy watching maybe the most, if anything, I'm biased towards those guys but I just, you know, I appreciate all of it man. I appreciate wrestling. I think wrestling is one of the most important aspects. I always show that that's the biggest base of the pyramid, you know, and I was never really a wrestler.

Speaker 7:          00:43:11       I wrestled for one year in high school. You know, it's, I don't have a bias when I'm looking at it. I'm really trying to look at it as objectively as possible and it changes all the time or what's important. It changes all the time because different levels of guys will enter the game and that's when things gets weird. Like gets things get weird, like when you get like a really high level striker that all of a sudden learns how to sprawl and is really good at wrestling. Maybe we wrestled a little bit in high school and then all sudden boom, he's in the UFC and you got to deal with this. Like, you know, you get to like a really high level professional Moitai type fighters who have really crisp striking. If one of those guys, one of those really top end guys, but one of those are Nesto who slept in his prime.

Speaker 7:          00:43:52       One of those guys stepped into the UFC. Everything changes in that division and then everybody has to figure that guy out. Now you have to, you know, everyone has to either evolve around his skills, find a way to, to be able to stand with him. I hope he gets beat up in the gym, you know, shooting before the man. It's such a, it's constantly changing. What's important, what's important is constantly changing. Where are we seeing like a new version like, oh, and then what if, what if one of these guys show site and then all of a sudden you got this Jon Jones version, this new thing, how do you fucking deal with this? You've got some young kid who's really confident, very smart and has unbelievable strength, comes from a background

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       and has the longest reach of any fucking human being on the face of the planet is blasting you and you can even get close to him and he's getting better every day. Every, every time he blinks he's getting a little bit better. You know? It's ridiculous. And also he's creative because there are lots of guys today that are awesome athletes. They're great fighters, but they are kind of boring to watch because they do what everybody else does and so, I mean, don't get me wrong, it's like all the respect in the world because they are doing something amazing, but it's not that you'd watch somebody like Jen Jones so you would watch Anderson, CEO of some of these guys. There's like, it's a master at work and you sit back and it's like, Jesus, what is going to do now? You know, he's an artist. There's a reason why it's called martial art.

Speaker 1:          00:45:08       Martial artists. That's. That is exactly what he's doing. That's artwork, right? When you watch his shogun fight, watch the John Jones shogun fight. If that's not like a symphony, it's like a beautiful work of art. You know what he did is he. He destroyed one of the best fighters on the planet and he made it look easy and it puts it in perspective because you know, fucking Leonardo didn't have some six, four do it, trying to punch him in the face while he was painting his masterpiece. Absolutely believe if you watch the John Jones Leo Machida fight that that is a work of art. I absolutely believe that that's artwork. That's fascinating. The finish was so beautiful. Everything about it, everything about the fight is incredible. The fact that the yellow tagged him a few times, Liotta look great, but he just, he caught Leo. Oh God, I'm on the ground of days.

Speaker 1:          00:45:56       I'm on the ground and caught him in that standing gear, Tina God damn woo. But you put it all together like as far as like, it's awesome entertainment impact. You cannot. That's a work of art, man. Absolutely is a different type of art. I like watching some time somebody's entire career kind of radar than watching a bunch of fights from different people. Like watch one guy and watch back to back finds of their stuff and you see the evolution of their style and you really see a style. They're at work and it's, it's awesome. Yeah. That is a fascinating thing to watch guys evolve. You know, I remember Anderson Silva's first couple of fights when he first started fighting in pride. He was primarily a standup guy and he had submitted, when he went to the ground, like Takahashi, I think it was, got him in a mounted triangle and then um, with wrestling shoes on, I think he did was hit Takahashi.

Speaker 1:          00:46:42       Now somebody, uh, some dude who had a losing record of all the things, the same guy. You. No thinking about shown it before, um, before, uh, he's the same guy. You'll meet Carlos Newton by decision and in one of the Bushido events that cause it. That's it. Yeah. Okay. Now that's awesome. Yeah, and so he mounted them and guide them in a triangle. And then Rio. Joanne got him in that flurry flying. He'll book. You never seen Anderson Silva lost in one of the most spectacular finishes of all time. It doesn't get any better than that. I'd be stewed Rio shown and fluid him sideways, tied his legs up together in the scissors like a movie that's like some shit from a movie that's like some shit from a pro wrestling show. And then caught him in this

Speaker 7:          00:47:30       flying. He'll hook and Anderson like immediately tapped in screaming in pain, you know, that's really the best submission I've ever seen. Crazy. And there's anything that craziness. And on top of it I apparently Anderson's foot was fucked up when it was going into that fight. It looked like the second he touches him and is already tapping and screaming and going crazy. Apparently. Yeah. He went into that fight with a fucked up foot. That's why he wasn't. He wasn't moving so well. Yeah. That's what it looked like. So that guy goes from that and then all of a sudden he fights in the UFC against Chris Leben and now you see this master, you know, you see like, wow, like the way he took leaving a part like this is a master, you know, the way he moved when he liked everything leaving through, he's like shocked out of the way, encountered Bam, Bam, Bam.

Speaker 7:          00:48:15       These just precise counters and lievens charging forward and he's blasting them with kicks and knees and punches and you're like, God damn is he good? Holy Shit. His fight for as good a fiend. I mean I do. What the hell can you say? Well, you know, you know, one of the interesting thing is that forest, I had an interview with him about that and he told me that he had gotten knocked out twice in training camp before that fighting. So right. Right away he probably shouldn't have even been in it. Right. You know? Right. I mean, if you get knocked down in a training camp like two times, how many concussions are you allowed to have like really close back to back, right? That already are disclosed to somebody touching you the right away and you're like, well, there's been a few fighters that have had that happen to them and they both got knocked out exactly the same way.

Speaker 7:          00:48:59       One of them was a, there was a dude who was fighting in the UFC for awhile. Um, fuck was Marvin Eastman. Marvin Eastman got knocked out. He was a. He got caught by Travis. What the fuck's his name? Luther Travis Luder. Of course, Jesus Christ. How can I forget that guy's name? Who's sick? Jujitsu guy, but not really known for being like a super powerful striker, real strong guy. I can't believe I forgot his name. Travis. I'm so sorry. I love that guy. Actually, I just had too much weight. Do I blame it on the weed? That's way too much weight and really strong. I've been sitting here stone like a crazy person over here. Yeah. It's not good for your brain. Stuff's terrible for him. Anyway, Travis Luder caught Marvin eastern with a right hand and just like at the end of the punch and eastern went down like he got shot, but he got snipe from a, from a fucking tower.

Speaker 7:          00:49:51       It was a. He had gotten knocked out twice in training camp as well by a. He was a knockdown once, I think by Tito Ortiz accidentally ran into a knee and knocked down another time when I take down attempt so you know when that's happening, man, you, you know you can get knocked out super easy. It's big enough. MMA and religion. That was one of my favorite moments ever when a eastern mountain lost a fight to vitor belfort, did that crazy knee and sprite and then they added the cameras in the post fight interview on Belford saying thank you Jesus for giving me the strength to do what I do. And then they pan on. Marvin eastern phases like you

Speaker 5:          00:50:27       sold that is pretty top one looks at a. I think you said, if I remember correctly, you said he looked like a good spot, Diana, which has the best line server, but it's really, really unfortunate that I actually saw that it just kept it to myself and you see Belfort going out about Jesus giving him the strength that you see somebody had been plead with blood everywhere and you're like, really? That's what was going on. But I thought that was pretty funny, but that'd be a good guy. But I think a lot of fighters really, uh, liked to believe in the Lord and like to, you know, to be on a good path because first of all, I think it helps their fighting. I think a lot of guys who were Christians, you know, they have a little bit of extra faith. They have a little bit of extra calmness, like extra belief in themselves.

Speaker 5:          00:51:14       If you truly are a believer, there is a benefit to that psychological as a tool, right? That's why do exist for edits and Dane doesn't look like it makes sense, but that's why it succeeds because he'd believers the huge benefit. It helps people be disciplined and stay on certain paths, you know, helps people, uh, you know, stay on, uh, uh, if you, if you really truly believe in a higher power, you know, it's much more likely that you're going to have a, at least some sort of a code that you're living by. Right? Does that make sense? Totally. What is it possible to live life like? It'd be really nice without that mean is it possible to give Vince people to live like a, like, you know, live like a free person, but also live within principles of decency and just abandoned everything else. I'm very much thing so, but it takes, um, it takes special people because not everybody can handle it because a lot of people, unless you keep them in a little cage, dale go crazy and do all sorts of messed up stuff.

Speaker 5:          00:52:15       It's kind of like the daoist I left out is because you see them, they are. The first fatality is like, our staff is, you need to be smart, you need to be sensible, you need to have all these tools that you don't have. So go to take confucianism instead, it's better for you because you won't fuck things up too bad. They'll give you a simple rules to stick, to limit how much damage you can make. Confucianism is bad, therefore you seriously just go there. Our stuff, it's too, you know, they are elitist. Obviously they are a little bit with this, but so is life, you know, not everybody's gonna get it. That's how it is, you know, it takes a hell of a human being to live with no rules and steel behaving amazing way, but that doesn't mean it can be done. And uh, so in that sense I find, you know, all the rules, giving her allegiance useful for a segment of humanity. But then if you want to talk about full potential of human beings, I feel like no, you can do better than that. People have a real hard time with that though. When you start segmenting human beings and saying that some people are more worthy or some people are more capable or some people are more even evolved. You know, I haven't ever last cell so I don't care.

Speaker 5:          00:53:26       But I mean to be, let me explain it so I don't sound too much like a vassal butts eats, I believe in being nice to anybody. Okay? I don't care. Meyer stupid, whatever you should treat everybody giving them opportunity, you know, it's like prove to me that you're not a moron. Great. I'll give you all the opportunities in the world. But at the same time I can be delusional and expect that everybody's going to be amazingly smart and you walk into any room and you can throw. It's like I kind of expect people to suck, but I'll give them all the opportunities in the world to prove otherwise. And I feel like that weighs a healthy balance between being realistic about it and being without turning into a jerk. You know? Um, so you think that if, if the government came out and said, hey, listen, we, uh, we did some studies, it turns out religions, totally bullshit.

Speaker 5:          00:54:14       And we're going to start from scratch because we don't know what the fuck is out there. What percentage of people do think we just go completely batshit crazy and riot in the streets? Would it be any, would anything change it on isn't not based on evidence anyway, so it doesn't matter what anybody tells you. You a lot of people wouldn't be marching through the street. That would be one way where people would like really show how much they believe in March. They would start marching through the streets. They would organize it, would really put out a message, but that's one of the coolest things about living in us today. The in general in the Western world, you'll find a few. Not even that long hand. They're 200 years ago they were, you know, you'll burn people on the public square kind of thing. They, they disagreed today.

Speaker 5:          00:54:55       Even the hardcore fundamentalist, they got all riled up and they got piece, but they are not the Taliban, you know, they may think like them, but they don't act like them, but we were trying to stop it from getting any further than this. It's anybody that has that much faith in what they can't see. That's, that's, that's a disturbing thing. You're willing to die for this. That's an issue, so they're willing to die. Part of worries me is you're willing to kill whatever you know. It's your life willing to enforce your ideas. Yeah. The one that pissed me off the master of this things is the euthanasia debate. The fact that today in 2012 with the technology that we have where you could let people die in a good way, you could black, you know somebody say, look, when I get to that point, I want to be able to shoot me an injection.

Speaker 5:          00:55:45       You put me to sleep. You give me the other one that puts me out without being, yeah, that's their damn life. Nobody's saying that you need to die that way. You want to go in whatever way you want to go, good for you, but you really want to tell everybody else how they die. It's a tricky thing, man, because I think there's a lot of people that have cranky old grandparents push them motherfucker into that bed. I go, look, he's been delusional right now, but he's been telling us to kill him for a couple of days. Just going to go ahead and do this, but there's the double thing. You have either people should do when they are young, what do you want to do in x amount of situations and sign it. Then the one that are less, they change their mind, but that's what stakes or they pick somebody that the same way as they pick somebody to manage their bank accounts.

Speaker 5:          00:56:31       They picked somebody who can make those kind of decisions. Wow. Because otherwise really you are in the position where today you have a sick dog, you can take them to the vet and they are gone in no time with no pain, but for human being, you have to suffer every step of the way senior, your body go to crap and it's very uncomfortable with giving somebody the power to shut off a life. We're very uncomfortable with it. Right? It's tricky and in my mind is that's you know, when you love somebody, you care for somebody and you see them go down that path and that's what they want. That's the biggest thing you can do for them. Just let them die the way they want. Yeah, no, I see what you're saying. I mean, I, I agree with you, but I think people, like I said, are very uncomfortable with the idea, especially religious folks.

Speaker 5:          00:57:16       Yeah, it's God the side when you get to yours, so let you waste away for six more months in order. But essentially they do kill you anyway with painkillers. You know, with a lot of people when they, when it's towards the end, keep flooding you with painkillers. It's not pleasant because he's not that. They don't feel anything or they don't realize that anything they do realize that feel, don't realize it. So it's like it's not a productive way to go. Fuck, I'm over the school of thought and just, you know, just what happens when they cure that. What happens when people don't get old? How many goddamn people are going to be here? If they figured out how to stop people from getting old and dying, we might have a real problem. We might not even. We might have to build spaceships, see it as well.

Speaker 5:          00:58:04       There are too many people just at that point or will be more and more and more if we start dying and keep people kept fucking right would be nuts. Jesus Christ at that point is where you can have the UFC have, uh, you know, give a sword to some dudes, put them in a cage and everything, go at each other for any show you know, you have a disagreement with anybody or anything. Please circle it with swords in the cage. And it sounds really stupid to say, you know, that people would devolve to that level, but when you get like a lot of people together, they sort of devalue each other when you have too many of them in the, uh, that deposit it in the future and radiation sickness and who knows what the fuck's going to be going on now? Life becomes cheap people.

Speaker 5:          00:58:49       It's kind of like even in the ancient world where people die left and right all around and people were a lot less sensitive about a human life where you could have the gladiator or some people clap and think it's cool because it's like they see people dying left and right all the time, hey, at least you got to die. After you train a bunch of minds. You look like a hero, Eh, you've got your head chopped off, but hey, you know you are going to die anyway, six months in some other way, so might as well. Isn't it amazing when you really stop and think about it? Isn't it incredible that people ever got past ancient Rome we ever got to today? Think how nutty those assholes were? The people were finding lines with swords and shit. Do it throw lines at people. God Damn what?

Speaker 5:          00:59:29       A bunch of crazy assholes. Two weeks ago some guy emails me from the history channel and say, are you by any chance an expert on Caligula the Roman emperor? And like, not really. I mean, I read to my Roman historian stuff, but he's like, perfect. Just come on, read my email, it's like, Yo, you sound great because you've known you've got a book that you looked at once. So I was an expert on Caligula. The history channel is awesome. It was, but it was cool actually. They did their homework. I read all their stuff. They was all on the spot, you know, funnier than the history channel when they got to do that. Comes onto sasquatch expert. Right. Like what it's been lately. And how, so, so how much did you have to know for them to use you? You know, I was actually surprised that I knew more than I thought I did, but you know, it's not like I'm the expert because I wanted to highlight or add something.

Speaker 5:          01:00:20       But then I was like, hey man, I don't remember all this stuff. Did you have to research it before? I was like, cool shit. They bet their homework, you know? So I did that. He read the whole thing and everything and to make the connection fast there. So you don't think about it for five needle. It's going, uh, you know, but Culligan man, crazy motherfucker. That guy was, I don't mind sort of wild, I mean Caligula was sort of, you know, to the 10th power, but Roman Culture in general, Jesus Christ, this guy's were violent with pointed. I mean, you know, today there's the, uh, you shoot it and killed people in ways that are cruel and unusual. All of them, they are all about, you know, the more violent, painful and public we can make it, the better it will make a statement to the fact that you don't fuck with the state. That's bizarre. Virta, how did Brian Go?

Speaker 5:          01:01:26       That was, that's what you get for shit. And outside of that bathroom right there. She just went right there. Ladies and gentlemen, that, that break in the podcast was Brian got locked outside and he was banging on the door. Sorry, Brian, you silly goose it. Comedy Club has like these automated locks when they're closed. And so I went out to go because we're not supposed to shit in his bathroom. So because it shits and makes everybody smell the shit. Right? But no one's working today. There were some people here are the word. Okay. So I didn't want. Alright, so where were we? Where were we talking about? Crazy Romans. Oh yeah. How, how amazing that culture was. A bunch of savages. People got through that. That's we our ancestors of people. You know, some, some of us are at least of of people that live there. It's not like people went extinct back.

Speaker 5:          01:02:08       No. Far From It. What a, what a weird time that have been. Huh? What a ship roll. The dice that is getting born and you're living in ancient Rome. It was spun out. UFC started both the people who hated it and the people who loved it compared to the gladiators gladiator opening. We, we just abandoned it into the new one is fucking crazy and seemed unusual or new ones. Amazing. But the, the, the, the gladiator opening was on for a long time. Everyone's just like, who is this gladiator dude? What is all this about? Rubbing dirt in his hands and shit. And it was just like, what, you know with the Italian music, you know? And then it's the opening onto the, the new. The new opening. Is Wick it though? Yeah.

Speaker 8:          01:02:51       Huh?

Speaker 5:          01:02:54       The gladiators, what was Caligula's deal quickly. It was completely out of his fucking mind basically. Was He, do you think he was clinically insane or you think it was just mad with power? I think that's the beginning of it. Then of course, you're gonna operate in an environment where, uh, you know, your Ankle Keel, soul of your family or brothers and sisters and her mom to the point that she was a scenario and then gets there to start to that, you know, that's the environment you grew up around Jesus, even if you are totally saying you started going elite along over the edge, why they do that to everybody because they are a main bus starts and uh, they protected their own power and anybody that they felt could be a threat to their power, they would get rid of them in fairly nasty ways. Price.

Speaker 5:          01:03:37       No, he's no different than any gang or any, you know, it's human nature that way. Where at its worse. Yeah, because there was no rules. Essentially they were, they were calling the shots. It's amazingly, people ever get to a point of royalty that people allow that hustle. You know? It's a very strange hustle that even though there's no fucking food, everybody's starving. No one, you know, there's no prosperity. There's no books. People are so silly. They'll believe that this one guy is worth more than everybody else controls their armies and he's their noble leader and. But that would. That would be a cool job. I sign up for that after you guys pulled that job off and then somebody would kill you with a sword. I think today I started, well, I started saying, no, most people suck and I have a disability thing that I want to be the king of the universe. That would be great. That I think every smart person thinks that there would be an awesome king. I would be different. Listen, there's a lot of things. It'd be assholes or I was the king. That's how every cart gets caught, gets started, right? Some guy comes along and goes, listen, these other cults, they don't fuck their doors the way I would do it. All needs to the lab really nice and as long as I'm uncontrolled, trust me or I'm really, really honest and objective about this.

Speaker 5:          01:04:47       When is, when are we going to fucking figure this out?

Speaker 2:          01:04:51       So I got my results back for my physical Joe. And you had a physical. I guy at full physical. They tested blood every month and they said that I'm like 100 percent. Everything's fine. My cholesterol. It's exactly perfect. Like the only thing that was bad, he's like, just take a little bit of d, You don't get how much do you. And I'm like, no, I don't cut out. So he's like, just get some over the counter, dee the you'll be fine, but you're just a slight. No, that's good. That's good. And no stds. My first AIDS test mooching off of a test, but you got a real one now. Congratulations. I'm glad you know Diane. That's awesome. Yeah, that is good. That's a monkey off your back, right? Totally. That's, you know, I kind of feel like I eat somewhat healthy. Like what I'll do is I'll eat healthy and then I'll have a shitty day where I'll eat fucking pizza.

Speaker 2:          01:05:38       You know? So it, I think I have the a good up and down. Isn't it crazy that your va, your body actually produces a vitamin by looking at the sun? Yeah. You're out in the sun. Your body produces vitamin D. that's why when you see like George St Pierre, when he's fighting and he gets Tan, that getting pampered like that is actually actually makes you perform better. There's nothing nuts. That fucking crazy. Getting a Tan actually makes you perform better as a fighter. Like what? What is the bad part about having a tea? Not Much d though. Like if you were an extreme case, would you just be like, oh I can't.

Speaker 1:          01:06:12       Yeah, you'd be fucked. It's really bad for you. I really. Yeah. I think that's an issue with the people that live in really cloudy climates as well. Like Seattle. Yeah, I bet they have a problem. We keep going.

Speaker 2:          01:06:21       Just Seattle today. Seattle called them heaven. See Cock. Seattle is a cool place. Well, how dare you. Yeah, I look so beautiful up there. Oh by the way, somebody told me they just got back again from Tempe or Phoenix, Arizona and went to that new club and an Arizona. It is the most amazing place ever and that you would love it. It's 600 seats, but they have. They have like a person that follows you around let's like your own like, Hey, can I get you something? Like you each have your own individual, individual person, a Sam triple. He went there and just had like a crazy party. He said it was. He saw somebody doing shit in the elevator, this elevator walk up and then people were having sex in it and stuff. It says it's awesome. It's a party. So check that it's the, you know the one I'm talking about right there, having sex there.

Speaker 2:          01:07:10       What's going on? Why don't want to give away Sam story because he hasn't said it yet because he has a naughty show at night. So. Oh, so he's going to say it tonight? I think so it's just how many podcasts are you doing in this day? Three today. Should we? How? How are you going to listen to other people talk? It's impossible. How can you. How are you going to do this? You gotta you gotTa shut your ears off after awhile. Huh? Do you go numb? Just know it's just kind of meditate. Well, listen to it, you know. Wow. It's a lot of jobs aren't guest.

Speaker 1:          01:07:39       We need to have a religious question and answer podcasts with you. How about that? Let's do the shit would not be fucking bad ass. How people that have questions to religion, they contact you and then they could buy your books to what is, what is your one that you published recently on disinfect? What is that called? It's called the 50 seats. They are not supposed to know religion. And the genesis of this was kind of interesting because originally phd from book about religion and he was, you know, these big, thick, heavy book and that they are like, yeah, you know, that's sweet, but we're in the business of selling books. So give us something, you know, what is the big thick work? What was that going to be about? It was, um, that's kind of looking at

Speaker 5:          01:08:16       old basically what the approach that Bruce Lee added to martial arts, I was trying to play, adapted to religions, sort of like taking a bunch of different religions to look at what all the big questions are a look at what some of the answers that are out there to make up your own thing as you go. And uh, because ultimately to me that's the only thing that anybody does, you know, it's, I'm making call Legion college philosophically. Whatever makes you feel good about bottom line is a way of life. And so I was like, do your own work to see what's out there and come up with your own answers that way. And actually now that we did this one, they decided to go for it. So I think I will publish the other one toward the end of the year, you know, in end of 2012.

Speaker 5:          01:08:58       So this would be a really big book. They asked me to cut it a bit and it's a good idea because there's too much stuff and people will be like halfway through what I go back. It's no more but uh, so yeah, I'll do that one, cutting it a bit and um, so that one I was super excited about, but back then they are actually smart because they know that this kind of stuff, sales because he's um, quicker, funny, weird, random, informative stories in and out, you know, you read the one next, you know, you don't feel like you're liking that one, boom. You jump to the next one. So there's 50 of them and uh, but yeah, it was, it was weird because when I originally signed up to do it, that was in as now I'm really happy I did it when I started, I was like, Eh, I needed money.

Speaker 5:          01:09:40       I guess so sure. What the hell, why not? But in my initial mom and Danny was in a shitty period of my life because I signed on, it was like January 2011 or something and I said sure, I'll get it done. And they like do it by April. Like okay, that's a little tight, but sure I can do it. Then that's when everything went to shit with my wife, six weeks in the hospital, horrible things. And then the second one though that was over, I'm now responsible for a 19 month old baby to deal with there all the time and I have a Montana enough read left to right this stuff. And I'm like, Shit. Now that's intense. And um, but the thing is generally, I mean I break more laws than I can keep track of, but one thing I do is I don't break my word ever.

Speaker 5:          01:10:29       And I told them, you know, I'll get it done. They were even being nice about it. They were like, we can push the deadline, but like, no man, you know, you wanted it done by then even eats good for me. It gives me something to focus on. Right? So they do dan being there, you know, contemplating my navel thinking the word. So I have something to do. And not only that, but it has to be funny, lighthearted at a time when my life is really not needed or funny or lighthearted and sweets. It was actually good therapy for me because I could, uh, you know, while I'm giving my daughter meal come thinking about what the hell is the next line and I get to make it snappy, fast fashion, but funding, but I think I could do for myself because I'm, you know, as soon as you write while you were holding the baby, as he literally got to the why where I would dream about what I was going to write at night.

Speaker 5:          01:11:18       I would fall asleep. Like I finish writing, I pass out, I dream about what I'm going to write when my baby wakes up. I'm like holding their feeding around. Like, okay, look at that thing over the next line, you know? And then the second one she would sleep. That's when I would write the most. Of course I would be like, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Okay. Now bus out next day. Wow. What a crazy fucking schedule. How long did you do that for? A couple of months. It was maybe two other than to win enough months. That's how long it took to make the book. Well, so it's 50 things that you're not supposed to know about religion. It's called give us one of them. What's a good one to see? What's fun? Let's stick a big men coming up with the titles was half of the phone.

Speaker 5:          01:12:04       I'm, I keep myself operating them. I have one chapter I think is kind of the stuff I was telling you earlier is called. If you are too stupid for them, you can always try confucianism. That's always would make me popular in China. Uh Oh, this is great. There's this guy, um, the title of this one is God is wearing dragon robes and wants you to keep confusion. Assess. This is an awesome story. Is in the 89, this one, a Chinese guy became converted to Christianity and he started saying that he was Jesus' younger brother, that you had this vision of God that was wearing dragon polo shirts and told them that Buddhism and Confucianism or crap and it was his duty to stamp them out. So he got their APP or this follower started preaching in the countryside, gain all these people. They became so powerful that they carved out their own state within China and they said that this was going to be, I forgot what it's called.

Speaker 5:          01:13:00       It's something that I have to find it because there's just too good, but he was called something along the lines like a, the evan leaking dome of everlasting peace or something. Well, the heavenly kingdom of everlasting peace ended up with the debt of 20 million people in the course of civil wars between the Chinese government or was pieced over these guys thrown into Medicare way and these kind of weird version of a Chinese fundamentalist Christianity fighting against that. His guys. And eventually when they laid siege to the CT, he was telling his followers, don't worry, God is on our side. And of course he died shortly thereafter by eating some boys on Missouri by mistake. And um, and that was that. What year was this all going down? I want to say meet 89, I think. 18, 2017. 30. And how many people died in this conflict when t me $20 million.

Speaker 5:          01:13:49       Yeah. So one dude came along saying that he was Jesus his brother and 20 million people died as a result of this one guy. Is that essentially what you're saying? Yeah. Typing, going on 1858 and 64. And um, yeah, that's. And that's why is not supposed to know. He's like, I've never heard about that. That's such an immense number of people that died. I mean, what they fuck they get the numbers we had the benefit of the doubt is maybe 50 meters old. How knows? But you know, that's what some people have speculated that the number was. And how would they know? Right. 20 million people's a guests back then, right? Of course. And uh, but he's brutal civil war racking China for a band, which is one of the reasons why a bunch of Chinese people migrated to California at the time when there was the gold rush is because south China was get the indirect left and right.

Speaker 5:          01:14:38       What's this dude's name again? Uh, the guy's name was hung to something that's going to be a lot of people. Gonna want to play that guy on like video games. It's going to be their name. Go on as this bad motherfucker convinced a bunch people. He was Jesus, his brother. Shit. I have no idea how to pronounce it. That's a high level pimp game right there. Sign Hong does. She would try and I have no idea. It's hard to pronounce. I make it tough. How do you spell it? It's age. Well, Chinese is spelled two different ways depending on now you, but the one that we're using was h o n g and that's one word. And then the next word is x. i, u q u a n. wow. So good luck fixing on this. It's really fascinating the way the Chinese have a language, you know, it's phonetic obviously because if they're, they have totally different characters that we have, but the way they've expressed it in like the letters that we use.

Speaker 5:          01:15:36       So it's bizarre really. Some of the words are really strange, especially like with x's and them and shit. My wife, my wife is Chinese and she was trying to teach me some Chinese and I was like, I mean I couldn't say it because she kind of hated Japanese people, but I was thinking, Jesus, couldn't you just be Japanese is so much easier. Japanese is easier to learn. Easier. It's the way you read it, it's kind of the way you pronounce it. There's only one toe on it. It's easier. Chinese is the same exact ward with tiny different tax. That means completely different things. And there are like four different tax ids for each ward. Oh No. It's just like, oh no. Can anybody say anything? So you think it's more complicated than English? English is a hard one to learn though for some reason. I mean I'm sure if that's where you come from, if you speak Chinese or something, yeah, English must be a pain in the ass, but for anybody coming from a vaguely Latino background or anything, any of the Western languages trying to pick up chain, any tonal language like Chinese, Vietnamese, some of those, it's just like that.

Speaker 5:          01:16:39       It is pretty fucked up that we all speak different languages. How many, you know, I mean, how many problems would be solved if everybody spoke one language that would be nice to solve anything at this point in time would it? People hate each other from New York to Irvine, so you don't. You don't have to, but it would out. You will be better than nothing. That's for sure. It is pretty crazy how different languages are too. I mean the difference between like Chinese and Norway, Norwegian and Chinese accuser in a bigger difference.

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       Is it even possible to get something more Chinese and you know, how about Chinese and African tribal languages for. They're all. They don't have the. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Awesome. That's fascinating man. It's just so incredible how it evolves differently in different areas, but it all evolves. You know, how many different languages are there? Are there hundreds? Thousands. I'm going to go on some bullshit guys since say what? Surviving today because of course their languages, but wait, wait, but let me bullshit first. Let's try surviving today. I want to say

Speaker 9:          01:17:50       say

Speaker 1:          01:17:51       the wind, they're 50. I'll say

Speaker 1:          01:17:55       176, I'll say a thousand. I think you're actually closer. The more I'm thinking about it because there are a bunch of languages in the world. Oh my God. They between six thousand eight hundred and six thousand nine hundred distinct languages. The modern world. Holy Shit. Where we off? Holy Shit. Where we off? You are the closest dude. Yeah, but I, I thought I thought I overshot it to be honest with you. I thought it was probably around 900. Right? Holy Shit. That's incredible. Well, I mean 90 percent of that or languages that are dying that are like 30 people in a tribe is still speak and clicking noises, clicking noises. Well, how bizarre is that when they have places, like there's some spots in the Amazon that they're, you know, just just recently discovered people in these tribes and the, this is the first contact that they're having with the modern world and they're in there with their own wacky language that they sit at.

Speaker 1:          01:18:51       One of the few guys have had some contact with them. They promptly killed him. So yeah. Good luck making contact again. The someone made contact with him, there was one guy who was like an India from a different tribe, so he kind of understood their language, but she also was, you know, more immersed into mother and Lord and they'll have less. So he was kind of like in transition between those two words and they. Yeah, they killed. Nobody knows why, but yeah, they walked him. Well, I think they probably have heard that some shit goes down when the loggers move in and you know that that is what happens to these people probably. Yeah. There's w. What folks don't know is there was a, a bunch of people living. I mean they are people. They're living like people used to live thousands of years ago. They're, they're essentially essentially, you know, living in ancient tribal lifestyle that we didn't really even think existed anymore.

Speaker 1:          01:19:44       They have their own handmade tools and weapons and you know, they're wearing like fucking crazy leaves on their dicks and shit and animal skins and it's there and they're still in there. And then these people who are logging are going deeper and deeper into the forest and they're just cutting down at an astounding rate. Yeah. And there's all these incredible medicines to be found there and all these different and animals that haven't even been discovered yet and insects that haven't been discovered yet. And who knows what the fuck's in there and they're just shopping that shit down and left and right. And these people oftentimes are getting caught up in this where, you know, they had, they lived there in that forest and that deep in there for thousands of years. And then all of a sudden one day they wake up and they're fucking, they're there watching trees fall in the distance, you know, like what the fuck is going on?

Speaker 1:          01:20:31       And they just coming towards you. It's an inevitable swarm of tree eating machines and there are all these people, these greedy people behind them and they don't want to move around you and they're going to chop your fucking trees down. Get outta here. Yeah. That's living like a savage. Yeah. They're looking at him like you're looking like a fucking. He live in like a savage on here. What the fuck you doing? Trapping and shit down. We have all those people had a wild life for a long time. Who's to say their life isn't more interesting. This is doing Iowasca and fishing and shit. You know what I'm saying? If you're pretty dope, you know what I mean? If you get used to living in the jungle, it's a hard, hard life, but there's a lot of food there. You know, you could become it. You could become food fucked up that to zig when he should've zagged. There's a thing called a Brazilian wondering spider that kills you by giving you an erection until you die.

Speaker 1:          01:21:26       It's fucking, it has something to do with nitric oxide and uh, which is like the same stuff that's in the works and like Viagra and stuff that makes your dick hard. And apparently this, um, this spider hits you with it and it causes some crazy fucking reaction. It's neurotoxin. It's the most powerful neurotoxin. None of the man and your whole body just completely stiffens up and horrifying agony. And your Dick gets hard as fuck so hard. It's like breaking like your Dick is in gorged and breaking and even if you survive it, which most people don't survive, but even if you do survive, your Dick will be destroyed. The deq would be useless. It would just be a bag of bruises.

Speaker 3:          01:22:07       Sound like fun. That's just from one bite from one, but what if it just linked you and then you just had a really hard boner all the time in their life. Doesn't work that way if you just got a little bit. It doesn't work that way, but I do believe that

Speaker 1:          01:22:18       pharmaceutical companies are like investigating the effect that this thing has on your body to develop new hard on medication.

Speaker 3:          01:22:25       Yeah. You know, developed substrate that gives you a hard on for a year. They're going to do. That's the next thing you know, like Viagra is like, it's not effective enough. What if I want to fuck 12 hours from now I need. I need something a little more kick to it, and they came up with Cialis. They'll have like jeans will have these new pockets there. These tubes that just kind of go up to the side where you just put your dick in during the day because you have a rock part. You don't want to, you know, you're gonna have a boner everyday tubes, you know, like you'll have like a little pocket to put your ticket. They'll start selling new pockets and their tools trap. Right, so it can move around with you. Yeah. It's like a cargo pant pocket for your deck there. You're going to have to just point it up towards your belly button. Go over the top.

Speaker 4:          01:23:06       As you're walking everywhere, all the articles are going to have a belt buckle marks. Periscopes there can start forming different. That might be actually the most comfortable with.

Speaker 1:          01:23:18       If you could just walk it straight up. Yeah. Yeah. Just some sort of a tent. Put a dick tent over it. You know,

Speaker 4:          01:23:25       I know exactly what you mean. That's

Speaker 1:          01:23:31       in the jungle though. Maybe the. Maybe these nice lagers are saving these people for the life of perpetual. Yeah. Death by hard on in the jungle. You ever see that movie? Big River Man. No documentary about some crazy guy who swam the length of the Amazon River. It's disgusting. Why did you got all kinds of fucking parasites? His skin and his body and his breathing and drinking that water, taking it in and Oh my God, it's because he's crazy. He just is really, really funny, crazy guy who liked to swim and be like, do these swim endurance things and uh, you know, he would do it day after day after day and he would, he's getting delirious and shit. It's a really strange, like documentation on this guy. He's like, he had done a bunch of different endurance swims before and you know, get all these people behind them and it's a documentary that's taken by his son.

Speaker 1:          01:24:24       It's really interesting because his son, you know, is like watching this guy do all this nutty shit and sort of falling apart and all the different parasites he's getting from this water. Oh fucking crazy man. I can imagine that you're, you know, that's your father and you'll keep it up camera and going for the next 20 days as the. It's just, well not only that, he would like jump off the boat into the night in the middle of the night and start swimming and then have to follow after him with spotlights and shit. This crazy ass hole with this crocodiles out there and this guy is swimming in the Nile River and he survived. He survived. Yeah. Fascinating. You know, and he actually kind of looked like once he cleaned up and dried out and everything like that, he actually looked like you made it through. Okay. Which is even more crazy.

Speaker 1:          01:25:07       Yeah. That isn't that. Yeah, there's just some dudes out there, but I mean that's the random. And so he told you, you know, you're going to fucking die in the safest place in the water because everybody could fall on you or something. Or you can sweeten the Amazon for thousands of miles and come out fine. It's like, what the fuck, man. Really. It's a weird thing that people have for wanting to do difficult things. You know? I tell him, I've always felt that way about like Mount Everest. I had a joke about it. Like it's just because something's hard to do doesn't mean it's good to do. See people get a little confused. It is because the difficult things to do in this life usually come with reward. You know, your risk yourself, you know, you leave your job, you start your own business and that reward is how it worked and now you're making it financially. Graduations you're a success. There was a risk and there's reward in that case. That's not, that doesn't look like the reward is worth it. No, no, no, no. If you could stop

Speaker 5:          01:26:05       put, letting. Is there a way that you could ever say that anyone running for president cannot talk about religion? It's almost like even if you believe, it's almost like you shouldn't be allowed to talk about it in the political process. It's almost like cheating, you know, it's almost like you're not, you know, you're, you're going after your people, man. You just trying to get your people divorce, like will do it. Of course. That's our little chunk of fewer opioids. There's a. It was supposed to be that way though, wasn't it? Yeah. This time. Uh, yeah. But I mean, I think honestly what happened is that Utopian about, so could they offer early dress waters for so long that they, people got really annoyed by it. He was like, I'm done enough of this shit. They were chopping each other's bowls. So the fact that you would read this book and I read this one hour about what you do, whatever the hell do you want to, let's keep it already John Sattler for politics and be done with it.

Speaker 5:          01:26:58       You know. And so today in a lot of Europe you go to churches and they are a tourist attraction and so, you know, in the countryside now people are still into it, but in most of the cte seats they read our knocked. Most people don't go us whole different game I think is the only modern industrialized country where there's these levels of insane embark on their religion. I mean today there is no way that a good Aha guy equal never even bother running for president is. Has there ever been a time where an atheist could have ran for president and not anyone else? No, never. I mean, some guys where we are like Thomas Jefferson or something, he basically 83rd the Bible by cutting up all the stuff that he thought was crap, which was most of it and saving, you know, like he took out out of the gospels.

Speaker 5:          01:27:45       He took out the virgin birth, the miracles, the, all of the stuff that he knew his mind was a bunch of crap. He saved up the pirates of Jesus that he likes saying he's, he's a sweet guy. He tells you to be nice to each other. I like that part where we keep it up. Art and that became the Jefferson Bible. He said he said averse. How long was his Bible? Like 50 patients bridge much. But I don't remember how long ago it was about and what a cocky dude. Yeah. Things. But at the same time he was a dick. I mean, it's probably a dick at the same time. Uh, you know, come on man. You can't edit that thing, but you know what, you don't get to edit it by yourself. The fact is everybody does. They just don't tell you because, you know, everybody highlights the power day like, and they completely keep on the parts they don't like and so they come up with their own thing anyway. At least the guy who had the guts to say, this is exactly what I'm doing. What everybody else does it, they just, you know. Well, there's always so much contradiction. Then. How about religious tattoos?

Speaker 5:          01:28:46       That's like strictly prohibited. I know that's crazy, but when the Bible, yeah, you'll get the, you'll get that. In fact that we have, for example, a lot of Jewish people know what that tool is not on the, you get, um, you get all the sinks, like a white Jewish

Speaker 1:          01:29:01       girls with tattoos at hot. But she's a gambler.

Speaker 5:          01:29:05       Just rolling that dice. There's one that I threw in there that's um, uh, what did I call that one? It's, Oh, it's titled the Christian fundamentalist. I would love to introduce you to my pet King Cobra. And there's actually a reason for that because the in the gospels and there's the story of Jesus telling you that if you really have faith in him, if you are a pedestrian, Ndi fade and all of that, you could take boys on snakes, could our soul to you and bite you and you'll be totally fine. And I was like, wow, you know, if that's what Jesus is seen and different diseases, what you guys believe, Hey, let me. But in Gavin the snakes that savvy to try and it's like one of two things are going on. Either you know that the stuff you believe in is crap and you don't really believe it or you know that you are. That there are no good Christians because. Sorry, that's not the way it works today. I don't care how much faith you have. It's like nobody can survive taking the boys on our staff, on our or your Alameda deadline in the Bible is crap. And he was in, you know, it was booting there by somebody else, but he's not real. In which case it doesn't exactly say great things about the reliability of the whole thing, but it's like there's no getting out of it. It's like, how do you get out of that? You don't know.

Speaker 1:          01:30:20       I had a conversation with a guy recently there was telling me that there are people that believe so much that they can drink poison and not die. And I was like, oh man, what a crazy conversation we're having here. I doubt that, you know, have you seen, this is not scientific. This is not something that's been proven by studies. Like does someone say that they absolutely believe if someone can take poison and not die because their belief in themselves, there's only one way to tell homie that's my take that poison. Like, Hey, I'm not saying he's not through. Let's try convinced me aim. If you're right, you'll have $0

Speaker 5:          01:30:53       people following and you'll be the greatest asset to Christianity ever because you made a millions converts and they're actually to tell the defendant. Some of these guys really are serious about it. There have been a bunch of people were particularly in a, um, in a lot of Carolinas, Tennessee, a few places where there was this tradition of a snake handlers that they would, uh, you know, let poisonous snakes by them and you know, quite a few of these guys died, miserable dads and then some of them are boys and wasn't that much, so they managed to survive and all of that up. I'm like, Damn, really? Jesus Christ, what a way to go, uh, butts. But I love it when you ask things like that. I'm like, Hey, I'm not telling you it's crap. I'm not saying he's not through. It's there, let's test it. That just led just that way.

Speaker 1:          01:31:43       People need something, man. They're always going to need something whether they're going to need, you know, liberalism, conservativism, he did a path. They need someone that just chop out the brush for them and point them in the right direction. Whether it's Christianity, whether it's

Speaker 5:          01:32:00       atheism. I've met atheists that might as well have been religious stuff that they're just, they're so anti religion that there, it's a, it's a religion in and of itself. I had a chapter that I was supposed to go in the book that was basically saying that eight k stand hardcore fundamentalist are doing separated at birth because they are both based on certainty on how the universe works and all of that, but then my publisher decided, did you already are offending people, have 7 million different religions you want to have. We want to sell some books about us keeping the eight. This chapter, let's when they both have in common is they would all shit their pants if they saw an alien that I think everybody that's the trump card is the aliens. If a real fucking alien battleship, like all these stupid movies that keep coming out, there's another stupid movie coming out where it comes out of the ocean and then they fucking go to or the American military to shoot cannons at this fucking crazy robot monstrosity thing that pops out of the ocean.

Speaker 5:          01:32:58       Damn, I missed the jewel of cinematography. It's not out yet. It's coming think in March, but whatever it is, it's like is a never ending theme. Right? There's never anything with someone way smarter than us coming down and just fucking our world up hurling missiles through buildings. Buildings explode. It's like a standard vision of a Chinese adult when nobody could do are all these weird stuff going on with my body and nobody could figure it out. This guy was amazing. He just makes me like that, but the last time I saw him he's found a half hour telling me about there is our mother sheeps calming at the end of the of 2012 and who knows whether they are nice or not. He was really good even though I was like, what if he's right? Seriously, seriously was when old motherfuckers with their degrees and in suit and tie all the top doctors from Kaiser and all of that.

Speaker 5:          01:33:49       Couldn't figure anything out for me. Him these crazy eyes and do it in the use. Acupuncture, acupuncture he gave me. RBC was. I mean I was something like, I'm going to throw anything, but the dude is literally in this hole in the wall. He's wedding five watches. I don't ask why or anything. That's where all his baby mama was standing all over the world, so like that. But what do I have to lose at this point and why? The guy fixed it. He told me her back. I could puncture, we'll fix your back and then you have an infection that will give you the herbs and you'll be fine. Well, infection. What kind of infection? Yeah, no idea. But he was like, this stuff will magically, whatever it is, we'll get rid of it real up. Sure enough because I mean they did at Geyser. I dad like seven gazillion tests than from Mris to rx tool evidencing you name it. They couldn't figure out any stress related for sure. I mean, but stress can cause real stuff. Not just um, psychosomatic psychosomatics really fuck you up in specific ways. So I mean, yeah, he was thrusted related, embodied, like who knows specifically what it is, nobody figure it out.

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       And then the crazy Chinese guy safe me was telling me about Ufo was the whole time. And that's what I mean about while he was, while he was fixing it, he telling you about your phone still worked up, so thought that. So that's almost like eliminating the placebo effect. Like, this guy's fucking crazy. Yeah. Be talking to me about. You have those people love the idea of Ufo. It's a fucking amazing idea for them. It's fine. You know, it's so exciting. I know that they're out there and that they're watching and they're coming in, they're going to need to know what they are. Your friends or their key Leo. Yeah. I just, I, I just, um, I don't, I'm not saying that they're not real. Just like, I'm not saying that there's not really a guy in the clouds. It's just I've not seen anything.

Speaker 1:          01:35:44       Anything compelling. It's possible. Sure. I mean, I leave it open that it would come, but I'm not seeing anything compelling, you know, even the birth of a child. That's not what we're talking about. We're talking about Ufo as you fuckhead just tuned out and tune back in. Took my words completely out of context, how dare you. But if the aliens did land, that would be. That'd be the end of everything. If there was something way smarter than us, we would just have to give up. Right? We would have to. We would, we would be so stunned. That's when cults were just rise up. That's that. That would be a dark moment. If it's a real alien culture did come here for another planet, you know, people would really get frantic. That's when people would really like some stock stock up on food and 50 caliber guns and what?

Speaker 1:          01:36:33       That's good. Either way, you know, if you are dealing with something that's so much more powerful, so much so it's like you think it's possible for a society to get smart enough to be able to travel through space and, and go and fuck with other people or another planet. I mean, look at the stuff we do today. If somebody asked you if he was possible 50 or so ago, it looks like magic. I of this stuff. But we're always like one fuck up away from blowing each other sky high. That one doesn't rule. The other doesn't overlap with the other. You know, the fact that you can be incredibly smart and come up with all these awesome stuff doesn't mean you are wise enough to deal with data and not fuck ever seen God, which is humanity right there. That is humanity in a nutshell.

Speaker 1:          01:37:12       Yeah. It would be such a fucking shame if we library of Alexandria, this whole thing. It just went boom. Just torch this whole civilization. And we had to really start from scratch. Yeah. And I would see as little in my day I think, well that is the one sort of. I'm not, I don't want to say justification, but the one sort of argument for having one powerful military that dominates the rest of the world as I go to is that by doing that, at least they keep everybody else from blowing everything up. Keep keep your military from growing to the point where you were able to make the same decisions that we can make. We don't want that. Yeah. A, there's an argument and then I guess if you look at the statistics, like what people are like, you know, what the potential for people to behave as like, yeah, I'm not a big fan of the US government, but when I compare it to a lot of, there are a bunch of places and governments that I would like about turning.

Speaker 1:          01:38:04       There are many others. I'm like, Jesus Christ giving me George Bush again, you know, just give me the worse could happen. US ever. And the still I like it better than the Taliban, you know? Yeah, no kidding, right? Isn't it funny, you know, but it's amazing the spectrum of different sorts of regimes that exist at the same time like what's going on right now in Syria and while you know the Americas are complaining about the National Defense Authorization Act, which takes away a lot of civil liberties, so nothing compared to what the fuck is going on in the Middle East and the riots of Arabs Arab spring and what's going on right now in Egypt and the, the power void in Iraq. You know, there's parts of the world right now that are fa a fucked up a lot, a lot, a lot. I think we as Americans can barely even wrap our heads around that.

Speaker 1:          01:38:52       It doesn't even seem real, of course, because unless you leave it, what the hell? Yeah. That's something you see on tv for 30 seconds. That doesn't mean shit. That's like the one argument for a powerful military right there. Fucking press world, you know, and um, you know, people always say that I've, I've been accused of being a liberal. I've been accused of being anti military, which I'm absolutely not. I'm always anti the people that are pointing the military in certain directions. Yeah, that's what I'm anti. Yeah. Anti a lot of, a lot of the people's decisions at the very top of the heap. But as far as like having a military, yeah. You better fucking better. It is. It's the rest of the world does. Yeah. Yeah. It's good to have a military. It's very good to keep an eye on all these crazy assholes all over the world too because yeah, there's people.

Speaker 1:          01:39:35       That's the thing. People then at state good overlap with the every single about the commentary is amazing and wonderful and then when they find out that it's not all amazing and wonderful that some bad shit happened, they go to the extreme opposite and it's like every scene that some Eddy County is horrible, terrible, and the US is responsible for every scene that's evil in the world. It's like, no, that's not the more complicated than that. It's very complicated. It's very quickly. The economy in and of itself is very complicated and a lot of laws that are in place are very complicated and one of the reasons why they're in places because getting rid of laws gets rid of jobs. We're police officers don't like that. That's one of the big problems with drug enforcement. You know, drug enforcement as a, as a business, you know the Drug Enforcement Agency, it's a business drug and forcing is a business that you're spending money, jobs are created.

Speaker 1:          01:40:19       This is how ridiculous it gets. In Florida, they had people that were pretending to be high school students are, you know the story. I read it. I think I tweeted it recently and I mean there's been more than one case of these. One of them, they arrested 28 kids and another one, this woman was hot and she was 25 and she was flirting with 15 year old boys. They became facebook friends. They were texting each other and she was flirting with him, asking him to get her weed so he got her weed. This poor kid is poor love, smitten kid. Got Her weed and he said he didn't even want to take money for it. He said it was a gift. She couldn't give him money and then they arrest him and now they're going to charge him with fucking, you know, a potential nine years in jail or something crazy.

Speaker 1:          01:40:59       You know, what, what an asshole thing to do, what a crazy ridiculous asshole thing to do. And that goes back to that point is like, why the fuck do people feel the need to tell other people how to live? You don't like it. That's what we're talking about. It's a business that there's a job. There's jobs that were created in that sting, you know, they created this thing, they went into high school and they got kids to sell them weed and they did it in such a sneaky fucked up way. The fact that a 25 year old woman could ever have a position where she talks a boy thing and have that boy responsible for it. Yeah, dude, a boy and a 15 year old boy has no idea what the fuck is going on. He just sees tents and skin and lips and she's touching his hand and his dick is hard and he can't even believe she's talking to him.

Speaker 1:          01:41:46       He can't even believe she's talking to him. I'll get you weed. I'll get you whatever the fuck you want. He can't believe she's so hot. She looks like a woman because she has a moment that fucking bitches. Totally cheating. She's not 15. She's not a fellow high school student. She's a 25 year old cop, right? Assholes. How ridiculous. So that's the thing. It's like I got it. There are jobs in that fight. I get it, but unfortunately it's possible to figure out a way to like they don't want to get shot busting on a meth lab. He's in there. Labs are hard to break into. Isn't there enough real estate to going on where people could work to solve real problems going on? Yeah. You would hope you would hope, but you know, I don't. I don't think it's that logical. I think it's a money grab and I think people go where the money is and there is money right now in enforcing their current drug laws.

Speaker 1:          01:42:34       There's a lot of jobs that would be lost if we just said, right. Pot's legal, sorry. You know how many fucking people are going to be out of jobs? That's a, that's a real issue, you know, and it's something that should be corrected to. There should be a bill that addresses that as well and says, listen, we're going to replace these drug enforcement jobs with jobs where they're doing, you know, something more, more, more helpful, you know, whatever the fuck it is. Border Security, whatever the fuck it is. Something. Something that makes more sense. Board is courteous, terrible example, sure. Put them in torpedoes or submarines rather get to patrol the ocean. These are just, these aren't really well thought out ideas, but if you were trying to come up with a good bill, a good bill would be make marijuana legal, make it a readily available and sellable and then take the jobs will be lost and Drug Enforcement and put them into something positive.

Speaker 1:          01:43:27       So whatever it could be forestry, whatever, whatever jobs. But then the issue would be those people wouldn't be qualified for those jobs. So how, how do those people benefit from it are those people are just going to be shit out of luck? Not over the whole new career. Not only jobs that require you to, you know, study for 20 years, you know, I'm sure it could be a period of training where they still get money as they are getting trained for the viewer in Drug Enforcement for like 25 years, which a lot of guys are right. And then you know, all of the sudden it's banished, kinda sucks for them and that's not their fault. It's not your fault when you a young cop and you think that this is a. well, it's the law, it's what it is, but it is. It's almost not your fault.

Speaker 1:          01:44:06       You're, you're, you're suckered into doing something that's actually a moral. It just seems like it's okay because it's behind the wall, have something written down on paper somewhere, but the reality of it is it's pretty fucking a moral. You know, when you're, when you're locking a kid up in a cage because you caught them with some plants or some fungus. That's absolutely an APP. It's reprehensible and everyone knows that inherently they know it inside and if you don't, you're fooling yourself. It's really that simple. It's just, it's just, it's amazing that we still have to have these conversations and not only that we can do because if you look at the political scene, nobody, not Republicans, not Democrats. I mean not. Nobody was a shot at winning, let's put it that way. I would even bring up these topics because it's political suicide, you know, he's like, you are soft on their ad.

Speaker 1:          01:44:51       You really want the roads to be shooting anyway. No, it's like the problem is those dangerous drugs, man, those problems, those drugs that fucking socked and we need to like really get it out there to kids like don't fuck with heroin. I don't fuck with math, don't fuck with all these dangerous ones. You know, there's a lot of debt. And if, if things were legal, like if cocaine was legal, you would actually buy real cocaine. He would go to a pharmacy or whatever the fuck you would buy it if it was legal and goodbye real cocaine, you know, you're not getting real cocaine. Now you're getting real cocaine that joey has bought and chopped up and you, you know what I mean? Who knows what you're getting of Myrica Matt, uh, Albert Hoffman, the guy who will create the less day. And one of the things that you established me was, uh, you know, most of the stuff that goes for lsd around the word is not a name because the stuff that, the way I make, it uses certain compounds that are so rare that there's no way that he could support such mantra production.

Speaker 1:          01:45:45       They're just teasing them up over that stuff. Wow. You say whatever they sell out there, it's. I have no idea what the holidays, but he's served on these now my stuff and he argue a dang. Who knows? Maybe it's through a window, but he argued at ea staff would give you kind of hold the benefits of lsd without all the crap from St Louis. And I'm so treat us to lsd though, is still giving you the same benefits as the stuff that he produces was just wasn't as taxing on the body. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They made that shit illegal too, too much. She goes, actually you see these guys like a Suisse cammies to sylvere was all doing very now he's been dead for awhile. But uh, he's uh, and he was originally looking for a cure for headache. Like he was working on a headache pill and he came up with LSD.

Speaker 1:          01:46:31       That was pretty fun to come up with it and not even realize it took it accidentally. Got It in his skin and it was riding home on his bike and just tripping his fucking balls off. Yeah. Not knowing what he did, they had no idea what the dosage was back then because lsd like the, the dosage to body ratio has been compared to an ant demolishing the empire state building in 30 seconds. Like literally like that's how powerful like a little tiny drop of this shit is. He didn't know that man. He probably was drinking glasses of it though. Acid shots, shots of acid. Oh my God. But I did that. I met the guy. He say sat Sunday seem perfectly coherent and logical steel and all of that. So who knows? Maybe it was right. There's a different look that those old guys that have done acid having their eyes.

Speaker 1:          01:47:24       It is a different look. You know, they, there's a, there's a weird thing that you get sometimes we're talking to one of those old asset dudes. You might've seen some shit that's not available anymore. You know, they might have seen some limited production view of life. Threw acid that acid in the sixties. I would've loved to have seen what it was like, like the flower child, children of the San Francisco, early 19 sixties. You know, I watched that a hunter s Thompson documentary, a Gonzo the life and times I'm doctor and it's a fucking fun documentary, but one of the things that talks about what's the utopia of the asset culture, the early 19 sixties and San Francisco and they show all these people running around holding hands together, tripping their balls off, and it's really interesting, man. Like that was a, that whole fucking part of the world.

Speaker 1:          01:48:13       It wasn't illegal yet and that whole part of the world was just blossoming with all these new ideas and new music and this new sort of wild psychedelic culture was all like emanating out of this one place and they fucking threw the water on it and squash that shit. Yeah, it's amazing if you, if you just list them to the music alone and you asked them to what was in the 19 fifties and then you switched to a six days was like, what the hell just happened? He's like, he's a whole other universe right there as. Yeah, they, they came up with some fucking incredible shit and that makes it all happened. I mean, a lot of it all happened in that area of San Francisco, you know, it's a widow. Was there a moment in time, man, where if time travel is impossible, but time recreationists they ever figured out a way to to recruit, like we could just go in and peek that we know like remember those things that you had when you were a kid, the view sliders and it was like a dinosaur and you would click click and it will be the next dinosaur.

Speaker 1:          01:49:07       If there was something you could put on some goggles and just take a view as to what life was like in a certain area. You know, $5 million years ago, be like a fucking a security camera on the wall 100 million years ago in the jungle and watched dinosaurs rundown Jack and things. I wonder if that will be eventually possible. I wouldn't it if you. Maybe you can't have travel back in time that you can have a view get. That's where even if they just had some amazing computer simulation of what had happened. I think I'm good with. Yeah, what the fuck. We're lucky, we're very lucky we were living in

Speaker 5:          01:49:48       2012. We would have been dead at any other time in history where two week we wouldn't have been able to deal with the caveman era or the Babylonian Empire or the Sumerian days when was coming. That's supposed to take place. I mean, it's funny because he actually have to use us a lot of history, but then he argues that, you know, he makes up a lot of graph of course history. Robert e Dot Howard did like what? What did he use a lot? If you look at these maps, they are based on many of the cultures see nice sort of fantasy wall or dire based then on cultures that eventually evolve in a real historical times that we know of, but he supposed to predate all this stuff. We know. So he argues that there was Atlantis and it's super powerful. It's utilization and that collapsed and the ward went into this hardcore barbarianism and then civilizations who are rising up again and that's when Conan set scene and then the history we know of that comes down the road.

Speaker 5:          01:50:40       So is it so appealing for men? I mean the guy goes around chopping people set off, grabbing all of the most beautiful women in the land. I mean, do I need to go on? He drinks all the time. Yeah. But the, that era like that, that the, that, that, not that arrow rather, but that genre, the, the sorcery and the snakes and the monsters, he's always fighting and you know, Conan had the coolest fucking stories. Like what is it? I mean literally essentially taps into them young male fantasy. Especially the, as you become older, you're supposed to. I'm in my forties, I'm so drop that, you know, I'm not supposed to be like into like the next cone and movie. Like someone get it right. Like that's ridiculous. I'm a father and as a grown man and I'm in the Conan, the barbarian cares, it becomes, there was, it's a, it is, it taps into like a real curse adolescent childhood sort of fantasy genre thing in our heads. I mean, who doesn't want to. What was in the movie? What's the best thing? Life Corner, your enemies have been before you hear the limitations of women. Is that, what is the limitation lamp? I used to say lamination.

Speaker 5:          01:51:56       You know, it's funny, I actually grew up, I watched Conan a million times in Italian and so I never really heard it in, in English. And when I heard, uh, our note speaking it, I was like, oh Jesus, this is a whole completely different movie watching kids. At least that was the original voice. Like, Hey, come here. No, it wasn't just these mentally tough guy, but nothing particular, no one ever gets it right when they do like a voiceover, they hardly ever get it right that time. Maybe because I at least include that one first. I was like, Oh God, they English. Arson sucks. It's painful. It really. So the English version would arnold who wasn't as good. How dare you. Because it makes you laugh. His voice, especially when you don't expect it, because I was used to seeing Conan speaking like a regular human being and I'm saying he might have went with a, could accent his accent. Listen to you, but my accent is great. Will your accent has a certain amount of classical flair to it? The Italian accent. It's go to the garden. A role to the tongue. Say Right. Welcome to the olive garden. Welcome to the olive garden. He's gonna. Use that for video now. That's my new ring tone. Fluxion weird. A love affair with the olive garden. It's his religion. He didn't go with Judaism. Somebody tweeted me yesterday that I was supposed to tell him that I saw him at the olive garden.

Speaker 5:          01:53:19       Weird, stupid running joke. It will go on forever too. He will not let it go, but the strangest thing you've ever seen. Picking up people to 18 and stuff. I wanted to mention. Your fans are fucking awesome. I've never been around people who are like. After the first podcast I got to meet different people on facebook now I started at twitter and stuff and you know every single person I've run into as been really smart, really nice, super polite, but you check out their pages and they are all live like really interesting people. We are funny man. So I was like, man, I'm happy that there are people like that out there, you know, I think if you

Speaker 1:          01:53:57       that sort of that sort of a show, you know, you put all that kind of um, that kind of a vibe and have people like you come on the show and you know, other people that have had that people have really reacted to like Graham Hancock and I got this Sam Harris County. It's coming on soon and you know, having like really intelligent, interesting people on the show it and, and, and putting out, do you know, your own, your personal philosophy on things. You know, so people just fucking be nice to people. Stop being content to each other. Everybody can be cool. Everybody should be generous. Like surrounding yourself with a bunch of people that you really like and don't, don't tolerate any bullshit and negativity from removed that shit from your life. Remove that shift from what you're doing for a living. Push yourself in the direction that you actually want to go in.

Speaker 1:          01:54:38       And you know, when you put that out there, people respond to it and they start. It starts to become a part of their vibration, starts to become a part of who they are as a person. You know, and I think that's what's happened. We have like this crazy group of people that are super cool, you know, I mean, it's, I'm not delusional about this. It sounds completely ridiculous that I would even say, well, there's a reason why my crowd's cool, but if you go to my shows, the waitresses are always saying that, that he was so nice and that they're so. They're so generous. I think it's just, you put that out there, man. I think it's good for all of us, man. Like I didn't figure this out all on my own. I had to meet a bunch of people that started behaving like this.

Speaker 1:          01:55:15       I had to meet people that had their shit together, that impressed me, that we're nice and were positive and that impacted me. And I learned from the way they behaved. You know, I think, I think we're all doing that for each other and these conversations and you know, these, these subjects that we're having these know these subjects are, you know, it's unusual that you would have, you know, someone who knows as much religion in your life to as you do to sit down with and, and, and, and go over this kind of stuff. Right. There's not a lot of opportunities that people have to, to a lot of big group of cool people. It's one of the best things about this podcast. It makes me happy because, you know, I'm a judgmental little bastard so I see a lot of people where I'm like, Eh, I don't like you so much.

Speaker 1:          01:55:53       And all of that. So for me to say, Jesus, I'm blown away by the quality of people that are running into after that nurse just I'm not a wine was always like, you know, everything goody goody evidencing is great and one and fire from Athens. So I was really mad. I, it's hard to keep track of so many good conversation with some people that will touch base with me after that. I was really, really impressed with it, so that's awesome, man. Yeah. Like I said, I think you can put that out there man, but then out there it's what you're going to get back. You know, when you, when you put out there in the universe. It sounds completely corny and hippie and ridiculous, but I think the EU, we all, we, we all can do with like sort of absorbing a good community. We all could do that at the Internet and I think that's one of the big powers that the Internet gives us is it gives us the ability to form communities.

Speaker 1:          01:56:46       It gives us the ability to choose who you associate with and, and you know, and connect to people in a way that it's never really been possible before because that's the funny thing. You probably get the message from the guy in Iceland somewhere where he's like the weird guy in the village and everybody else is looking at him like, what's your problem? And now he has a chance to realize shit that are other people out there. You can see the water the way I do and the message board and on twitter, and there's always people from people from Norway and Sweden and Iceland and all throughout Europe and all throughout. I've have people that post from China, from islands, you know, it's amazing. You know, it's uh, the, the idea of twitter, you know, the idea of, you know, anybody from anywhere in the world.

Speaker 1:          01:57:30       It's like sinking up through this thing and then there's going to be something after that it was going to be, they're going to figure out some next step after twitter where things are going to get really strange. I hope for a while they come back, their name considerably just took me forever to get on twitter because it was like really do I want to get something called with dirt and it's like Jesus Christ to have some self respect there. Come on, you know, it sounds ridiculous. They should have called the corner and then I would have to respect that. It's. That would've been cool. Today's episode is called Conan. Yeah, exactly. We got a little silly today with Colin and I think we might have over Conan, Conan enthusiast get together. Sparks fly. Yeah, that's what it is. You ever read any Robert e Dot Howard and you were a boy?

Speaker 3:          01:58:09       Uh, I read the comic. I didn't read the books or anything, man. You gotta you gotta get the books to this day. You'll enjoy it if you're not going to read a book. Why am I even saying that to you? When was the last time you read a book? I'm actually recently, it started to re reading the Steve Jobs books, but I never finished. You like to read biographies? You read like Steve Martin's, right? Oh yeah. Also what is a, what did it say? Well, Steve Jobs was he do shit. I didn't finish it. I like, it was just kind of going through his, his, his, you know, everything. So is stuff I already knew stuff for the most part, but there's a guy, he sort of formed a little cult, our cult of technology and fucking slick. I got Gazal Fuck fanboy I used to. I was a fucking fat boy.

Speaker 3:          01:58:55       Did you hear about the Steve Jobs and watch his little speeches and shit? We would bring out new laptops. So dumb. Did you go with the controversy about the Steve Jobs Doll? No, I haven't. There's this steve jobs doll that was made and I think China and it looks so realistic and it comes with like all these like little things like, hey, this is for presentation so you can kind of play doll with them. But apple was like a cease and desist and so now it's like calling it a steve jobs doll. Oh yeah. Yeah. I'll show you a picture. It's scary. It's really scary because it looks just like them. What if Steve Jobs dolls became the new crucifix? People who are fucking crucifix come about. How did they.

Speaker 5:          01:59:34       Well, how do they start carrying around the one thing that killed Jesus. That's what an unlikely choice. Speaking of which can you imagine? Because up until not that long before, one of the choice for more of that penalty was as a people being bailed out budget, but not always the case. People would have hanging out there with bikes to get to a guy sas and that. That would be good. So, uh, the originator or the original story that draco was based on Vlad the impaler Baylor. Yes. He used to eat his lunch and they, there's photos of him. Well, not photos of them. Obviously the drawings rather have him sitting at a banquet table while these people are on spikes writhing around him. And that's how you eat his dinner, pick it up. [inaudible], see Cedar liquidity badges. Somebody thinking, let me figure out and I can shop.

Speaker 5:          02:00:21       And these giant Paula somebody says, but missing all the internal organs. So I don't kill them. And then they get slowly. It's like, oh my God, think of that horrible man. Just what a terrible way to die. Jesus Christ. It's hard to even wrap your head on. And it took a long time for those people that die. It took a long time. That was the goal. She's fucking. Yeah. And apparently the vlad the impaler story was a guy, he was particularly ruthless. And one of the things, because he was out numbered. So he, uh, set up a lot of these bodies outside the perimeter of his town just to scare the fuck anybody would come near and it was more like he was, he was like back up against the wall and had to take some crazy chances. Right. And yeah, I mean he became started right into it. Yeah. You imagine that man, they, they make a fucking monster movie about you hundreds of years after you're dead. What it impact you had. Yeah. That's when you know you're bad ass crazy asshole. Yeah. Seriously. But yeah. Can you imagine if that wasn't instead of punishment in Jesus' times. Now Christians today are the dirt and just, you know, all themselves and stuff. You'll just me, me, me make mimic the pole up the, that would be the thing you would do instead of the cross. Oh my God. People Enter Church Avenue.

Speaker 3:          02:01:36       Oh, could you imagine? Oh that be so ridiculous.

Speaker 5:          02:01:41       I mean, it's just as ridiculous as nailing yourself to the fucking car. I mean, what do you do when you're making the points of the cross the cross? I mean, it's such a bizarre symbol. Lenny Bruce said it best, he's like, he's like, 100 years from now. It's like people walking around with the electric chairs around their neck and fucked up the junk. I forgot how he said it. I forget. I forget exact wording. And then Bill Hicks had another one. It's like a really variation on that joke. He said it was like a Jackie Onassis and walking up to her whether with a rifle pendant on thinking about John, you know, really kind of on the same job, but it really is true. They killed him on that thing and people carried around. How'd that tradition gets started? Fuck. Oh, do much way to our different. I don't remember.

Speaker 5:          02:02:23       You don't remember? You don't remember how that tradition got started? How they started mailing? No. And they link people to the cross. You got high before the show didn't you know? We got a little too high in and out. It's rocket fuel son. That's high grade. It's not. It's problematic. It's a wave. Sometimes you know, it crushes you onto it and then you got to get back up on your board. Happy. Anyway. So it doesn't really matter some moments I'm on and that makes sense, like failing similarity in as long as you're happy, I'm happy. But. So how did they, uh, W, W, why do people start carrying around the cross? It was one off. Does a punishments like impaling people. The idea was how can we make you suffered reward in a very public way where people go by and they will see you slowly dying there for three days and uh, it goes back to this desire of rulers in 17 states and the Roman sweater, perfect example of these guys, but they weren't the only ones doing that tool.

Speaker 5:          02:03:18       Got into it because he was a way to make a statement which is don't fuck with us because if you ever even think of rebelling against us, this is what's going to happen to you. And every time you go down the street you see somebody there and think about you being there. You might want to think about that plan. Offer a value on that. You how often when they crucifying people, and I mean you don't have to do it that often to have an impact on people. I don't think you need to see that many people crucified for it to stay in your head, but, but you had cases like when the spiral psychosis, where after the rebellion they grabbed like thousands of slaves and nailed them one every so many hundred feet between Naples and Rome. That's a long fucking high and the entire way people on Colossus or oh my God, Holy Shit. It's hard. Hardcore. That is terrifying. And now how the fuck do people go from that to wearing one around your chain diamonds? How did she go from one P diddy? You know, big ass bling, bling crosses. So Jesus is up. That's what I love about 80 scrape shirts. You know, like Jesus don't like him, but the guy was very hardcore about economics. You know, one of the things he says is a easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to get into heaven. Wow.

Speaker 1:          02:04:38       Karl Marx doesn't go that far. You know what I mean, it's like easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to get into heaven. God Damn Jesus was dropping some poor man's science. So, I mean he is probably a bit in that. It's probably totally a bit in the crosses. So explain to me again, I'm going to write this down. Where did the crosses, how far did they last from old people? Piss Shit. He wasn't Jewish. Time is definitely money was emerged as well, I want to say started in Burger but, but the um, the people that were a pinned off in the cross, the, you know, the, the road that you were talking about, there was 1000. How many feet was it where people were on the cross? He was between Naples and Rome. And how far as the economic center later in April.

Speaker 1:          02:05:30       So he's a good chunk of. It's definitely over a hundred miles I can remember. So for 100 miles. Yeah. Whoa, Whoa, whoa. I forgot how many hundred miles people were strung up on crosses. Well, they add some thousands of, but he's a nurse for Lilian defeating spartacus. They had leaked already thousands of them and so they decided to execute them all by sticking demo long colossus between Rome and Naples where now, where the whole thing went down and um, make a very public statement about four others. Leave thinking about labels in the room. That is Nancy. Yeah, Naples is actually, it's more than that. It's because he's not a wire to do that, uh, at the Emmy's wherein, you know, big ass fucking platinum cross with some Nice Diane was on and maybe white gold and that's awesome. Exactly. You get the reach thing to do it without you, that rich people will know.

Speaker 1:          02:06:30       It's like, what the hell is or the big cross tattoo. That's another one, right? It's the same. I mean, I get it, I get what you're trying to do, but if you've really thought about what, what the cross was used for Jesus Christ now I don't think anybody knows that. I think very few people knew that there was a time in history where people were strung up on crosses for over a hundred miles. I mean, how many actual total humans was that I think has about $5,000, if I remember correctly. He wasn't in the thousands, that's for sure. I want to say five. Oh yeah. But I mean that's, you know, that's one of the thing in enrollment times they add gazillions, laves and yet hardly ever any rebellion. Well, you know why? Because when they do it, they got strung up on cross this for hundreds of miles and have their power lines.

Speaker 1:          02:07:18       They were replaced with power lines. The same visual of these creepy pap, you know the history. It's power lines are not as creepy as crosses brown. Well, no, I mean like, like those old ones, like those old ones where there's like a million wires all attached to this giant one. Like I have one in the back of my house. I just look at it every day. I'm like, oh, that's not good. Yeah. What about those? You ever drive like the certain towns and they have these giant fucking enormous ones that they hum when you pass by them and they feed, you know like towns are like miles and miles away. Those are, they can't. It can't be good next to that right now. That's got to be fucking with your system somehow or some form. Yeah. Is it ever proven that. I don't know, but there's a lot of houses even in Burbank because burbank uses still uses those power lines and there's a humongous ones and their houses below it and you just kinda feel eerie.

Speaker 1:          02:08:13       It feels eerie being around that area because there's just humming above. You like this humongous pool. There's different ones like you know, there's certain areas like really rural areas where your past by big fucking giant ones. I know I don't understand much about the science behind providing electricity to cities, but you know, there's obviously a lot of, there's a lot of energy going through those goddamn things. If your house is just sitting there, director of the thing is just right above you. Is that fucking with some things that you can't see? I think so. You think so? That shouldn't be. Did you google this? I'm just talking about what would I Google power lines. Cancer. It probably. Yeah. Cancer's always. We look for it, right? Yeah, but yeah, that's the scene today that nobody knows. It's like, hm, we have gazillions causes cancer about we don't know why. There are many, many, many things in our environment that are fucked up from the stuff we eat to this stuff, our land to all sorts of things that we don't really know what to what degree they were do in Oakland three builds, but

Speaker 2:          02:09:15       the fact that that Msg is even allowed to be used today. Oh, you mean just drives me crazy delicious though, Huh? It is, but it's so unnecessary. It was a bad for you or something. It's proven to give you cancer restaurants. Restaurants use it all the fucking time though. They don't tell you really. That's kind of like, hey, thanks. You might want to say, hey, there's something in here that might cause cancer. If this guy's telling me this why I smoke cigarettes, because the Chinese film ain't going to kill you bro. Unless you're driving through all day, every day, that monosodium glutamate, who do you know that we had a funeral for your friend because Montessori, but man was living large who nobody had this Chinese food addiction. He just could not kick. Yeah, but who knows though. Definitely known people who have died of cancer that just

Speaker 1:          02:09:59       just not linked linkedin. MSG, but how do they know that it is? It causes cancer in rats or something like that. It's just proven. Yeah. We're not rats. I think we can. Rats can eat some shit that we can eat. No, we shouldn't. We shouldn't really go by that. Yeah. Yeah. I'm sure I missed you. Is terrible for you. I think it's like a. it's just a flavor enhancer, right? Isn't like accent or something like that. Just a couple of different brand names of it. I don't know because I worked at a restaurant when I was a kid. Worked in like a Newport creamery, which is like a hamburger place. I think we had this power line cancer that can't get a fucking straight answer. Everybody wants to make you read things. Just answering me bitch.

Speaker 2:          02:10:43       In India, because of a study of 134 people with stomach cancer who were avid consumers of which food can contain msg. The federate fetter ration of hotel and restaurant owners in eastern India has asked its members to refrain from using msg. There's like a website called [inaudible] dot org, backslash cancer dot htm. And it's just all these reports of like where MSG is, like, no, it's seriously not. Why are we serving this? Where are we allowed to do this

Speaker 1:          02:11:10       deep? But you do you. Are you concerned with it for real?

Speaker 2:          02:11:13       Well, I, I, I don't think that's necessary. Here's the, here's the reason why there's a really good Thai place that's in Hollywood. Uh, it, they, they, they, I don't want to say the place, but palms all right. But it. But they use MSG and then I had it once with meg and then the next time I returned, I'm just like looking at the menu going, Jesus Christ, they put Msg in their food and they have it right here on the menu that they, they just like, hey, by the way, we use MSG. So I go, can I have no MSG? And they were like, oh yeah, sure, no problem. And so I got the same shit I got last time. It tasted exactly the same. It was delicious. It was amazing. It wasn't like like, Oh wow, there's definitely at night, maybe every government man, we're really trying to kill people, but giving them memos, chip set or a little allowing it. That's just weird that that's not a big.

Speaker 1:          02:11:55       I'm going to google. Is MSG good for you? What if it turns out it's good for you and maybe they told you that. Sure. No problem. No MSG on this one. The white guy get him the same shit. You didn't die. Yeah, I gotta take a chance by giving you a superior product but cutting it out. Yup. Good. Shut up. Eat it. Um, I don't know man. Is it, is it really that bad for you? Yeah, Msg is good for you. Okay. I'm reading something is good for you. An article on Forbes magazine argues at Msg, monosodium glutamate, uh, may actually be good for the world. What? Okay. Hold on. Since the onion daily, you asked the US health nuts avoided like the plague, but many parts of Asia. It sits on the table along with salt and pepper to enhance the flavor of meals, leading expert in Msg, senior scientist company named Blah Blah, blah.

Speaker 1:          02:12:48       Insist that the definitive link between MSG and headaches has yet to be proven. Furthermore, his own research has shown that the hospital's patients, hospital, patients who have lost their appetite more likely eat their meals. When sprinkled with MSG. This he postulates could help elderly and sick people improve their appetites, get nutrition they need and live longer or smoke weed. Smoking weed would do better than Msj. Maybe smoking weed. MSG together is the mother fucker put some mock poop on that shit. Well, I remember it being a big deal. I remember people were always saying avoid msg. Like it became a big deal. I kind of nowhere, right. It was something that people.

Speaker 2:          02:13:26       It's like right on kind of. I think like even one day they're like, oh shit, you know, there was this news

Speaker 1:          02:13:32       report saying that Msg is bad for you and then I'd Kinda blew up like radon did. How did people get like wacky rules as to like what you can and can't eat and like biblical days, like the cloven hoof thing, it's pork. What does that even make sense? It's probably, there are certain, you know, animals that are freaking dirty that are more likely to carry diseases. People do. You lead them and just freaking diseases. Steel gets battered around. So let just say that God said you shouldn't eat that were done with it, like chicken little sis and shit like that. So I mean, I'm sure it boiled down to reality, factual things that people said, you know what, we need to make a hardcoded rule because otherwise people don't respect it. So let's make it that God said so and you know, let's have everybody stick to it.

Speaker 1:          02:14:13       And then of course then they stopped making sense when hundreds of years later, thousands of theater slate their article Nisha and Saturday for. And so they no longer are, you know, the animals could be cleaner conditionals or whatever, but then the rules sticks around. Some of them are really nuts, you know, like at a certain point in time, it's not, it isn't based on health anymore. It's just based on this strange tradition. Yeah, there's no. And that you're guilty if you eat like the pig and the swine. Like that's the big thing about Muslims. I don't eat swine. Right. You know, they'll tell you that like, I remember that was like a cool thing for rappers to say. Like back in the nineties, they don't eat swine. You know what, you don't eat swine. Why not? It's delicious. You asshole. Crazy. You don't eat bacon or your heart because you don't eat bacon.

Speaker 1:          02:14:54       You know, it's just the idea that your religion to keep you from Bacon, just that's all you need to know. They're not looking out for you. They keep you. Keep you from barbecue pork as well. We'll get the fuck outta here. Your religion keeps you from spare ribs. They're assholes. They must be assholes. If you go to Dr Holly [inaudible] in Venice and have the spare ribs and tell me that that's not heavenly, that's not a gift of God. There's a reason God made those ribs tastes so God damn good. Right? I am done with your religion. How did you approach it? Is like if a religion doesn't electric, did you about Baker? It was awesome. After you. Religion doesn't let you eat vegan. They're not looking out for you there. They're assholes and I like nuts. I think that we need to make a new religion.

Speaker 1:          02:15:32       Are you willing to put this together? When you do your new book that you're going to be able to construct a new religion. The working title is create your own religion. So. So you're going to pick out all the best stuff. That's the idea that have to have any basis in any previous stories or how can it be substantiated? Is there any, you know like you could use scientology is what I mean. It's not based on faith so it's based on, you know, what makes sense to you, what seems to work and then you know, try it. And if it doesn't work, change it. But when you're including religions, are you allowed to include ones that we know somebody made up mean scientology? I don't know because I feel like it's no. Why is it. I mean, why is it any different than what had happened with that one guy with a dragon suit that million people died, but said it was Jesus's brother.

Speaker 1:          02:16:18       I mean, eat scientology was sensing that. Great. There are a number of people took extremely seriously. Then I would say, sure, let's play with it. I would agree with you if I hadn't met so many actors and I think that that's why I haven't done so. It seemed like, you know, the world of acting, it's a hugely popular, hugely popular amongst successful people as well. I think it gives them some sort of a framework in which to think and behave in a framework of positivity. Like, you know, everyone's seen that, uh, the Tom Cruise in indoctrination video, I was talking about a car accident. I keep it. If you haven't seen it, folks, you have to look it up. If they haven't pulled it from the web, I hope God, I hope they haven't pulled it. Do you think they pulled that cubicle? The yogi. The one.

Speaker 1:          02:17:04       Okay. Because you're a scientologist these so fake, charismatic and it's like, God, he's so good at it. He will be an awesome cult leader. Oh, he might have to do it too. You might have to step in. You know, they have to also stepping up because it's not high enough in the organization. No, no. I mean literally dude. And they have to pump him up a little too mucky thing. So man, I think he's so charismatic. You can get away with it. Just make sure you keep them on a podium. No one's even gonna know. But then again, everybody is always seen you on camera. You can always make him look the alert if you see this dude is like, I don't remember. Maybe he's not that short, but I thought from what I heard at is like these probably mostly like hobbits are not nearly as short as everybody says.

Speaker 1:          02:17:47       They probably want to make him seem like more of a loser because he upsets them. Probably felt good. He's doing probably probably. I mean, come on when there's a guy like Tom Cruise has been, how many goddamn blockbuster movies over and over and over again, massive success over and over and over again. You're going to look for flaws. He's gay, Short. He's gay. That's all you ever hear, Jay short the. I'm sure there's a name of the lab. I love you. I want your life so you must suck for some other reason. I wonder how much of an effect scientology has on his success. I wonder how much of a. You know how much of what he pulled off he would have pulled, wouldn't have pulled off. It wasn't deep in the throes of some. I think you're on your way to convert. To me, it sounded cooler and cooler by the sec on though.

Speaker 1:          02:18:28       Maybe man, maybe it's the way to do it. Maybe we need to all join like a reasonable cult, a cult. It really has his shit together. I bring up this over and over again to people think I'm fucking serious. I want to be clear right now. No, I'm not starting a cult for real. Just fucking around. All right. We're just bouncing ideas. They'll not really going to set up a compound where people can show up because if you did, man, this is the time of the of the world where if you did do that, he said, listen, we have 6,000 acres. It's in Wyoming. Anybody can sign up. We do a background check on you. If you're in build a house. Come on in, and we started town. Did you imagined? Yeah. Yeah. They would shut that down though, wouldn't you think? My guess is if we did that, would you be willing to go and be our religious advisor? I've always want to be the. Keep everybody on the same page. You know I got to crucify them. If they don't know you can't do that, you can't do that. We're going to try to avoid that. What we're trying to do is just get a bunch of people together that we don't really know that much. Just sue them out of their, their, their current dogma.

Speaker 5:          02:19:28       Okay. I like that. That's all we use. You know, so you, you, you'd be the guy that under like they, they can't argue with you. You're having some areas come up. Let's have a final match cage between myself and some areas and see. We'll get still get the top spot and some areas. I know the guy interest. Interesting. Sam Harris. Oh Sam Harris, Pakistanis. But some areas. So I agreed to Harris. She's going to start his own cult. It'll break off in its own direction is called to be smarter than our Colt. I just thread that. He started training Jiu Jitsu. Yeah, he's there for awhile. That's not that long. Okay. In that case, taking private lessons. He's got to come on. I'm a, I think it's March 8th is. He's going to be on and we're going to talk about. Take him on whether steel learning before he gets too good.

Speaker 5:          02:20:16       At what level is your game? Where you a purple belt level? What levels you're gay is weird too because I enrolled for the longest time, not in formal classes, so my way is we are, because I'm lacking some pieces of the game that you should learn when you're a fucking white belt. But then I don't put my weight. I don't put enough pressure on top. I don't do some of the stuff that are supposed to do that you learn as basics, but then at the same time I ever like weird us movements that I can tap. People were insanely better to me really is a, it's kind of weird. Is A, I can lose two really 50 people and I can be three to go to people. So he's hard to gauge in the same way. Yeah. Roughly give or take somewhere around there somewhere, somewhere around the purple's range.

Speaker 5:          02:20:58       But these a is not regular, you know, I'm better than a purple belt in some way and I'm way worse in others. And so it's, my game is a little weird that way. That's interesting. Like what, what do you, what, what style was it that you learned? What was like the first time? Um, I mean as far as good app thing goes. Yeah, no, I did play. It was medically, you know, grappling with no geese. So he was, who did you learn from? I started out with this guy, Tim Kartra mail was one of the black belts from um, what's his name? The guy was starting to crop up Sifaka Kleiber. Luciana, I'm Carmela was awesome. I really like his game. He was amazing. Grabbed Blur and uh, he showed me some stuff and then a lot of the time I would just add all the way to people.

Speaker 5:          02:21:39       Somebody a daryl garage, they had their Jujitsu guys come over and we will just throw. So a lot of it was not the real and formal learning. A lot of it was learned by doing and which has its advantages and disadvantages, you know. So I'm missing a lot of stuff that I should know. But then I have others seeing that, like one thing I used to that are like blogs, like vlogs or my game. He's like, I catch very dangerous when, if you're not an asset and the people you're rolling, we'd know what they are doing. You don't have to crank them like crazy. You know, you'll catch somebody in some cases when the guy's not. That'd be like, I would just tell him, I'm like, dude, yeah. You know, the scariest guys who some are, Paul says for that reason, I know he's terrified. He's seriously scary. He's terrifying event because he catches it. There's mean article or competition. So if he doesn't do it, the

Speaker 1:          02:22:25       guy going to step up and family and. But he just doesn't give you a chance to Zap. You barely have a chance to screaming in agony. Yeah. Tears guys. Knees apart. Yeah. It's terrifying. Strong too when he jumps on it. Yeah. He's a really unusual, terrifying guy. Yeah. A first terrifying guy that rips his legs apart. I can't remember a guy who was so consistent at doing that and you know, high level mma, it's really kind of a characteristic. Um, that guy, the Japanese guy one, he's one of those two guys are like neck and neck for the best leg locks. He's terrifying. He's so good at rapping. Guys up. My God, he's horrifying. He's got it. Also an amazing Omoplata submission called the inventory where you go, like you have the shoulder lock and then you grab an esg grip underneath the guy's face and you lean back and it just snaps his neck.

Speaker 1:          02:23:14       It's terrible. It's a terrible thing because its arm is twisted and you're pulling his neck back. It's nasty. He's submitted a couple of guys with that. He gets it all the time now. Humanity is one of those guys. I like his style but it does seem a bit of a Dick because he willing submission, like he really is just, he just three per leg apart and he just, he's dancing around all I have to finish guys off. I mean you kind of have to. I mean there was one of the reasons why he's so good and so feared is because he does that. Yeah, that's true. And then people will stop early that's dying. I mean, I get it, it's an advantage. They're going to try to take his conscience of what his idea is. They're gonna put his head that's throw, you know. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:23:52       I don't know. It's fucking hard game, man. Yeah, it is. You know, that's why like when this rampage thing happened to rampages upset at me, I'm like, look, he's doing a way harder gig than know what, what, what he's doing. He's a sensitive guy and he's got literally one of the most difficult jobs to, to manage on earth. You know, he's going to be irritable about shit. I'm sorry if I pissed them off. All I'm trying to do is, uh, assess things to martial arts in mixed martial arts. Fighting is a got to be one of the hardest ways to make a living humanly possible. It other than being a soldier, you know, it's like right up there, right? I mean even psychologically going into the game, knowing that somebody has spent the last year training just in order to repeal thyrex even more effective fashion show, especially when guys start getting super emotional talking shit to each other and they get in each other's faces at the winds, you know, things get really, really crazy.

Speaker 1:          02:24:44       I met them when I was. When I went to Vegas, I met. I went because I was a meeting and an eco tour and so I got one guy with a gun. I never met him before and I was really blown away by the way you see them on tv the same way you see me in reality and so column is like the opposite of what you expect. Like I kept asking him about fear, you know, going into it and being afraid and he was like a foreign concept to me. It was like, I think we have so, so much as a kid and got over the fear of portfolio minus the anxiety, all of that as a kid that as an adult, he just looked at it as a problem to be solved and there's no big deal and it's another day in the office and I'm just like, how fact that you do not fucking superior see Italy, how do you manage that?

Speaker 1:          02:25:27       That's I know. And you know, he uh, fought some of the toughest fighters in the world without attitude. I remember one time, I don't remember who it was he fought, whether it was Tim Silvia or maybe it was a, maybe it was Brendan, I forget who it was, but he was on the side of the Octagon and uh, I was looking over at him before the fight started. He looked over at me and winked. I'm like, this guy is so relaxed so you can just look at you and wink right before he goes to war. And he was just so calm about it. That's one of the reasons why I was able to keep fighting until later ages. He was, he was so common, they're preserved as energy, so efficient, experienced, you know, and that Greco Roman man, he that the ability to control guys. Apparently everybody says it.

Speaker 1:          02:26:08       Randy couture was one of the nastiest guys, like when he would grab a hold of the back of your neck, like that control was so nasty. You would like. There's dudes that have like different levels of control and you really haven't felt it yet and so you sort of have like, a lot of times you view a, if you train with people that only have a certain level of skill and then all of a sudden you train with someone who has a very high level of skill. It's baffling to you. Do you literally aren't even aware that someone could be so good? It's staggering to you. And that was a apparently a lot of people's assessments of Randy's clinch that he would get ahold of you. That's why he was so good at like dirty boxing guys. Like when he fought Vito Belfort. That's amazing. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:26:46       The first Vito Belfort fight, especially, they fought three times, but the first one, especially when he beat Vito and Vito was not just undefeated, he was just fucking phenol. He was tearing guys apart in the first round and and randy stopped him and randy, a lot of it was like that dirty boxing man. He was so good at it. Just controlling the back of your head and and pummeling you with shots and, and, and forcing you in the cage and taking the right angles and know that was a, that was the birth of random third to fire fighting. UFC was like, how the hell do you go from zero to fighting Vito Belfort and fucking animals. He's an animal and a great guy, nice guy to be around, you know, really nice to just around theater. And I was really very impressed with him. I was like, man, these guys are as good as they say.

Speaker 1:          02:27:30       I'm bad. There is really a cool guy. I'm excited that because they asked me to write a book on his career. Cool. I who asks you to do this. One of the guys that, these, um, enjoy gardener, he's one of the guys that I know for the trainers take studying her and so he said let's work on it together, you know, he wanted to do it and then my writing, so you say helping and we'll write it and do this thing about Ryan because he was saying, you know, most of the MMA books that are out there out to biographies, which are cool. But then in an autobiography you can only go, you know, you can only hype it up so much because you sound like an asshole.

Speaker 1:          02:28:09       Whereas doing it as a third person and we wheat a lot of the voices from Houston bone ends kind of like a early type of thing where you get multiple feel the, it's a different way of documentary to man and that's the plan. In fact, to the weight as um, as a book. And then to shoot the interviews. I was there for his very first fight against Tony Hallmark. I think it was 1997 or 98. It might've been [inaudible] 97. [inaudible] 97. Thank you. And uh, Tony Hama was just giant fucking pro wrestler and randy couture, doc under that dude's big punch, got him, took him down and strangled his ass. And I remember thinking, Holy Shit, look at that. Like that was the difference in like one guy was like his big, strong sort of progress or type character. But the other one had that, that stupid grappling strength.

Speaker 1:          02:28:57       They're remembered from some freaks in high school when I wrestled in high school, you know, when we were in, um, you know, a certain district and I went to the, the, I think it was like the regionals and I forget what it was called, but you know, the guys had one, like certain tournaments would advance to other tournaments. And so I got to see like the state champion wrestlers and I got to see like some of the really high, high level wrestlers. And I'll never forget this, the way that really good wrestlers could manipulate guys. Like just toss them and throw them around. I remember thinking Jesus Christ, like there's like, just like anything else, there's guys out there, they're taking it to a very extreme level. Unless you go and see it, you don't know that that's possible. So when I first saw randy in the UFC and he took down that Tony Hallmark, God, that's immediately what it reminded me immediately.

Speaker 1:          02:29:41       What it reminded me of is the first time that I'd ever seen real good amateur wrestlers and went, Whoa, like this is. This is some shit to deal with right here. Did you think you had a chance when he fought the beater, like because he needed to beat all those guys? Were the first guys he beat wearing good caliber for the ice and then when he stepped up to five feet or did you? It was a big leap. It was a big leap. It was his third fighter, his fourth fight, third fight. He did that one night go guys. And then the next step. That's incredible. That really is incredible. If you stop and think about that. I, you know, I don't think we knew what he was capable of, but it was really clear early on that he was just, his force of will was just too much.

Speaker 1:          02:30:18       Randy couture of the most amazing will ever. You know, you look back to the first pedro, his a fight, dude, Pedro, his hit him with some of the most horrifying leg kicks that have ever been landed in an mma fight. It took him six months to recoup his legs to rehabilitate his legs. After that fight, he showed me, he still has a hole in his leg. Muscle died in sport, the muscle or die. Think about that. Pedro Huizar kicks you so hard. The muscles die for forever in certain spots on your fucking leg. So Randy go to her, gone through that, and then rehab for six months. And then they talked him into a rematch. He didn't want to do the rematch. He's like, I don't want to fight this fucking guy. So they give them a rematch and he beats them down again.

Speaker 1:          02:30:58       Yeah, well, I think he just knew there's no way I'm getting leg kick this time. It just became, it didn't become a, you know, I think when you fight a certain guys, you start thinking, oh, I can take a lead kicker, and then you fight Pedro Huizar. You were like, oh no, you can't. No, you can't. Yeah, that guy, man. People don't even know. One of the reasons why I have such a fetish for leg kicks, like people always saying Rogan, you're so fucking queer for leg kicks. They art. It's because I've seen pedro, his old fight live and I've, I've seen what's possible. I know what's possible when Kaiser. Good man. I, yeah, I definitely call for them too many, but it's because they're awesome when they land. They are not, they are scary. Yeah. So, um, if people want to buy your book, what's the best way to get ahold of it through [inaudible] dot com or Amazon?
