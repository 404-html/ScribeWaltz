Speaker 1:          00:00:08       Zealot. Yeah. Did you start, did you launch that was the mail. Guess what? No sponsors. Just fucking cue the music and it give you a dollar at least. Yes. Give me a book. All right, cool. Hit it. Experience you podcast my night. All Day. Yeah, we have music. It's ridiculous, but it makes me feel like something's actually happening. [inaudible] Sam Harris. Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for joining me, man. This is really cool. It's an excellent opportunity. The internets or a buzz. I've gotten more response for this as far as like questions for you then I think any, any guests we've ever had. Great. Well I'm very happy to be here. I'm happy here too, man. I've watched a lot of your videos online. I've enjoyed every one of them and I like in some of those debates that you get into with those old Gracie in action videos.

Speaker 1:          00:00:57       Have you ever seen those old Gracie in action videos? I'm not entirely sure though. I know the ones you're talking about. I've seen a lot of Gracie material. Yeah, well the Gracie in action videos were really the first videos that Horian Gracie Horian. Gracie, a WHO's a hit, Leo's son, voices brothers, a brilliant businessman, and he realized that all he needed to do was put together a series of real life encounters between a train Jujitsu practitioner and some guy who thinks he knows how to fight. He's, he's sure he knows how to fight and then he just gets mangled every time, every single foot. This wasn't the Gracie challenge at all? Well, they've got a bunch of them. I mean there's Gracies Gracie and action one and two. There's essentially, it's just, it's, it's basically just compilations of home videos that they have of really for martial artists, really brilliant stuff to watch because you know, until the Gracies came along, nobody really knew that there was one guy out there that could just sort of manhandle people like that and just strangle them and children. If there was one martial art that was so superior when it came to grappling situation that you would watch those and you'd almost feel bad for the guy getting strangled, but not really. That's how I feel when I watch a lot of your debates. That's very high

Speaker 2:          00:02:01       praise. I can tell you it's not as satisfying in a debate format as it is on the mat. Oh I'm sure cause it cause no one ever taps. It's like you're, it's like you're fighting, you know, an army of zombies that they've lost but they, they, they can't be forced to admit that they've lost

Speaker 1:          00:02:16       it. Says it's must be a very bizarre thing for you because as far as like people who have spent like hours and hours debating publicly debating the merits or the idea of religion, you might be like, you know, like top 10 on youtube of all the, the, the different information that's available. Have you ever seen anybody in all these different debates you've been where you, you've knocked something into their head and you see like a light go off. Like Holy Shit, what if you, right. Do you ever get that?

Speaker 2:          00:02:43       Well it's hard to see in real time. People are pretty good about not having epiphany's in real time in front of you. You know, so, so yeah, you can see people get uncomfortable and you can see them want to make a lateral move to a new subject. Cause there's, there's a lot of, uh, I mean, one of the great strategies or, or the one of the, the less noble but effective strategies of debate is too, if you've lost a point, you just don't, you don't concede it, you just kind of move on to something else and hope no one notices. And if, and in, in a formal debate, a format, there's often no mechanism by which to sort of for your opponent to score that as, as conquered ground because you like, you can't address each other in real time. So, so, so it's like I talked for 10 minutes, someone else talks for 10 minutes.

Speaker 2:          00:03:28       The moderator doesn't necessarily interrupt us and we, the two discussions can't actually address one another. So a formal debates are actually, um, ironically the kind of the worst format to actually prove who's right, because it's like fighting someone, you know, vert you're, so you're separated by, it's, it's like, it's like boxing, you know, it's like the clinic, you get a, you get a clinch and the ref separates you. Um, and so you can't really test every tool, uh, in that context. And so, um, you can just kind of talk past each other and not address the thing that was brought up 10 minutes ago and it never really gets scored. So it's, it's, it's, um, it's amazingly unsatisfying even when you feel like you have said exactly what you should have said and you, because they just won't buy it. It's just like, just like fighting with fog, you know, no one never, no one ever falls down and, and it's occasionally you, you, you score, you score below that, you know, the audience has noticed.

Speaker 2:          00:04:31       But even then the audience is partitioned into, you know, the, the, the, your side and the other side. And it's amazing how, um, in vulnerable people's prejudices and biases are to two argument. So it'd be an also becomes a team, you know, become something that defines, you know, a lot of people are defined by their ideas, especially when it comes to their religion or their politics. You know, they're defined by them to the point where they like, act within certain parameters because they think that's what you're supposed to do if you're on this team, people like that. For somebody. I mean, it's a weird, creepy desire that we have to become part of a, of a team and defend that team. And I think that happens when, when, when it gets into religious arguments, it's like you're, you're not just attacking an idea that someone planted in their head and you're, you're, you're attacking how they define themselves.

Speaker 2:          00:05:21       Yeah. It is. It's, it's people's extended identity. I'm a windows user. Yeah. It's like I'm, I'm a Christian, I'm a Catholic. And it becomes, you know, it really becomes a big part of how they view and if you want to take that away from them, it's like, you know, yeah. So you can see that when you're having the discussion, it's especially obvious in a debate format because they basically, nobody has any hope that that either side is going to change their mind in the context of the debate. I mean, they've come there to represent their views and they've got so much invested in doing as well as as they can that they're not, even if they're mine was changed, they're not going to admit it. It. So it's not really an honest discussion. But when you are having an honest discussion, let's say we know one on one with somebody of deep conviction about faith, you can, you can see the kind of the emotional hijacking of the conversation on their side very quickly.

Speaker 2:          00:06:16       It's like, it's basically like debating whether they're their wife is attractive or something. I mean, it's just like a goes to something at the core and it's no longer about the ideas or evidence or, or, um, and so that it's one skill, which admittedly I, I don't have a such a firm grasp on, but one skill to acquire just as a person is to figure out how to have these conversations where you're, where you're, you're being as rational and, and intellectually honest as possible, but you're actually kind of making the right Jujitsu moves around people's emotional response because it's just too with comedy. Well, yeah, I that, that's what's brilliant about comedy. Yeah. You do it with comedy. Well, I've seen you do it, you know, compared to Elvis being alive, you know, and knowing that Elvis is alive, feeling that he's alive. Yeah. It was really very funny how you did it.

Speaker 2:          00:07:08       And it was the perfect way to do it because you did it very politely. You know, there was no name calling. You didn't get all shouty. Yeah, yeah. But that, that is what is brilliant about pure comedy because if you, if you make someone laugh at themselves or, or the idea that they would otherwise defend, um, you know, you've, that that actually is a visible sign that you have, you have made contact, you know, cause it's, and, and you don't get, you don't get that when you, when you're playing it totally straight. And so comedy is very powerful. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:07:40       Also, obviously you're restricted in the language that you can use and these things, right. It's, um, it is a, a fascinating sort of a, and an exchange. It's a, it's fascinating to watch the psychological. We'll spin, you know, when, when people really get behind an idea, whether it's religion or whatever the fuck it is, when, when they really get behind it to the point where, you know, they're not budging at all. They're not thinking at all. They're attached and married to it. It's very dangerous. Right. I mean, isn't it?

Speaker 2:          00:08:09       Oh, well, yeah, insofar as someone really believes something and the beliefs have any point of contact with behavior and the rest of physical reality, I think it's, it's, it's the most consequential thing. I think what people believe is, yeah, that is the, the lever that moves most things in our world. You know, it's politics, it's public policy, it's the laws we write in the law as we choose to, to truly defend and, and they're all just ideas that are, that have a certain number of subscribers. Is it

Speaker 1:          00:08:43       possible that religion in its form is useful for some people because they're just what a, whether it's psychologically they need, they need some scaffolding, whether it's, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       Eh, to use it as a tool, not to use it to control anyone, but to use it as like a personal growth tool. Do you ever look at it like that? Well, in so far as it can be taken out of the belief space where it says, so there's, there's the, the, the doctrinal belief based part of religion, which is where people are making claims about reality on bad evidence. And that I, that's just a problem. I mean so far as your pretending to be certain about something you shouldn't be certain about and then teaching your kids to do that. That's just a problem for our, for our conversation with one another. As human beings, there's, there's all this other stuff that people are attached to that isn't inherently problematic. So they liked the music, they liked the buildings, they like the, the style, you know, they like the artwork.

Speaker 2:          00:09:44       They like the, um, they like to think about certain historic figures who they have this sort of emotional bonding widths or GNC. They love the stories about Jesus in the New Testament. And, um, all of that is, uh, some of that could be intrinsically good. I mean, if you get the right, you get beautiful buildings and beautiful music and a reason to come together and holidays and Mso. So I think we actually want something very much like that in secular culture. And we, and we, I think are suffering from the fact that we don't have an obvious alternative, a secular, reasonable, reasonable alternative to that, um, that we can just point religious people to and say, no way, no, how come you're not doing that? You know, this, this has everything you want without the bullshit. That's very important. And, you know, if someone tried to form some sort of a secular group like that, it would quickly devolve into being a cult, most likely.

Speaker 2:          00:10:34       Yeah. Depending on who become someone trying to fuck everybody's wife. Well, we had some other top that comes when someone's at the top who has the eternal wisdom, uh, and it is important to you. And part of that process of dispensation is to fuck your wife. Uh, that there's actually a story. I, I think I had told in an end note at the end of faith, I knew some guys who, who brought out a guru from India who they just thought was just the, quite literally the Messiah who's, he was a story. They kind of naked yoga and the yoga who just for this little little, uh, um, uh, almost a speedo track a speedo. Yeah. Like a and long Jetta, you know, long dreadlocks and he's kind of this kind of gorgeous 25 year old Indian Sato who was silent, so he wouldn't even never speak.

Speaker 2:          00:11:23       So though the only wisdom is very kind of low bandwidth teaching, the only wisdom you're going to get from him is what he could write out on a, on a, like an eight by 10 chalkboard. So he'd write these, you know, just gnomic little sentences in response to your, your questions. And he was a really good drummer. So he would leave these curtains, these devotional chanting, uh, uh, sessions where he would drum and people would get a quote quite out of their minds and happy. And so they were just worshiping this guy. They brought him out. Um, and at a certain point he can be, I don't know how, he must have communicated this on his chalkboard. He said he needed to start sleeping with the various, you know, um, uh, as, as luck would have it, the, the most beautiful wives of his devotees.

Speaker 2:          00:12:08       Um, and so he was doing that and, but the breaking point came when, uh, uh, the one guy who was his host whose wife was sleeping with him, um, gave him Haagen Daz this Saudi wanted to, to eat Haagen Daz Vanilla ice cream with cashews for breakfast. So that was like, he, someone gave him Haagen Daas and it blew his mind. And so he needed this for breakfast. Uh, so the, so he was Wa this guy was walking through the, you know, like the Ralph's a freezer aisle at, at, uh, in the morning getting us a resupply of vanilla ice cream. And that was the moment that was the, that was the, the final Straw where he realized, okay, this guy is, is just, we're just guys tool. And they just send them back in India, you know, he's like, you put the ice cream back on the shelf. That's hilarious. Hacker bags. Yeah. No, it wasn't, it wasn't the wife. It was the, it was the hug.

Speaker 1:          00:12:59       That's ridiculous. So what did the Haagen daas just represents something so silly that it couldn't be,

Speaker 2:          00:13:04       it was just, it was just too obviously carnal. You know? Like there's no Tantra. You might, you might be doing tantra with my wife, but you're not doing top drawer with the Haagen daas for breakfast Muesli Card or ice cream.

Speaker 1:          00:13:15       That's very funny. Yeah, man. I mean, I think it's just a, the primate instinct when any man is in any position where he's got ultimate power over a group of people. It's a terrible idea. Yeah. That's why everybody's afraid of what's going on right now was in terms of, you know, government and new laws are being passed every day. It's, it's good. It gets kind of spooky. It's like how much control do you really need over people? Is this is, I understand that you know, we're in trouble some times. I understand that we're at war, but do you really? How much, how much control does the government really deserve over people? I mean do, do we, do we really need to be in this situation we're in right now?

Speaker 2:          00:13:51       I, I, I'm, for the most part, I'm kind of libertarian on this subject. I mean, I'm not, I get a lot of flack from Libertarians based on, on the, you know, the 5% where I depart from, you know, classic libertarianism, but like actual defense authorization, you know, I just think ea, the principle is that peaceful, honest peoples have the right to be left alone. You know, if someone, if you're not harming other people and you're not stealing from them and you're not yet, and you're honoring your contracts, you know, maybe we can define what all that means. But if you are not an infringing on other people's happiness, then you have, you should have the right to be left alone. And what that means is we as a society shouldn't want the police to kick in the door of a peaceful, honest person to stop him from doing, from what whatever it is he's doing, smoking pot or you know, you know, whatever victimless crime is currently illegal.

Speaker 2:          00:14:48       And if you draw the line there, I think get a very sane, a response or very sane idea of the limits of, of state power. Um, and, and it's, um, yeah, it's, it's, it's all about mitigating harm and keeping people safe. Now, now obviously we can't, we can only, there's a trade off between freedom and, and risk. So, you know, there's a tension between let's say, um, the, the right to privacy and finding actual terrorists, you know, so it's like if we, if we, if we wanted to maximize, we're going to find everyone who's a terrorist, well then we would just, there'd be no such thing as privacy and we, every day the government could read all our email and looking our windows, et cetera. So there's, there's a tension there and we, and we have to keep finding the, the, um, the sweet spot, but it's, it's a, it's a tension that everyone should recognize.

Speaker 1:          00:15:42       So do you think that these new laws are being passed, like the Nda, do you think that that's the idea is that as the population increases, as is crime going to keep up or pick up to a point where they're going to need something like this? I mean, when, when you think of someone being able to detain people without warrants and not even have to inform their family and that, that could be an American citizen, I mean, at what point in time would that be effective?

Speaker 2:          00:16:07       You know? Yeah, I don't see, and again, this is not really my area to have a very strong opinion. So, uh, you know, I would be open to any counter argument on this, but I've never seen the, the, um, the wisdom or necessity of infringing on our existing laws to, to fight the war on terror. So the idea that, you know, the people at Guantanamo, I'm, I understand that there, there were different things apply on a battlefield and, and, uh, you know, in a crime fighting scenario in, in, you know, in the states. But I mean, why, why people don't have the right to counsel or the right to see the evidence against them. I just, it seems like it's crazy if they're guilty, you know, they'll let let the, the truth shine on the, on the data.

Speaker 1:          00:16:54       Well what do we hurt is that we were always, you know, growing up there was always a problem with Russia and there was always this idea that we could go to war with Russia, but there wasn't like a really strong belief amongst people that we were the good guys and then we did all good guys stuff. Only you know, that America was making sure the rest of the world didn't start speaking German or Japanese or any case. But it doesn't feel like that anymore, you know? Now it seems like as the age of information has gotten us to this 2012 date, like where we're at right now, it's so easy to get information that people are just so much more cynical about their intentions. So if you see laws like this, like what's the motivation to crack down more on civil liberties? He said just to make it easier for them. I mean, is it to, to create bigger government? What, when, what is the motivation for that?

Speaker 2:          00:17:44       Well, it's, it is fear and some perception of necessity of, of, of, of taking the friction out of, of the system, the system that that would keep us safe or respond to an attack or detect an attack. Um, and it's understandable when you think about what the President's daily briefing must look like. You know, it's like, it's gotta be absolutely terrifying. And, and the, the reality of the prospect of nuclear terrorism is like once you actually just put those goggles on and say, yes, the nuclear non proliferation proliferation is more or less a lost cause. I mean, the, the technology is spreading, the material is spreading. He got a 30,000 out of work scientists in the former Soviet Union who have every, who are not taking care of, you know, who have every economic incentive to not be entirely ethical. Um, so if you feel as many people do this, just a matter of time, that new, a nuke in some form gets into the hands of terrorists and we have a, a massively porous border.

Speaker 2:          00:18:53       The joke is if you want to get nukes into the the U s you just hide it, hide it in a bale of marijuana. I mean, it's like we can't, we can't fight the war on drugs. So the idea that we can keep everything out is, is pretty much a pipe dream. So, so when you start thinking about the idea of a new going off in a major American city and forget about the loss of life, just what would that do to the world economy? It's, it's easy to see how the paranoia get ramps up. So I, you know, I don't, it's a hard, these are obviously hard calls to make for, for anyone and um, you're going to look, just imagine the day after and an act of terrorism, orders of magnitude bigger than September 11th, what? W two to have to talk about the reasons why we didn't do all these things that we could have done to keep, to keep us safe.

Speaker 2:          00:19:43       So I'm very much, I mean I share your concerns about infringing on civil liberties, but, uh, it's just the way you look. Scary. It's scary. Or on the other side it scared the threat is scarier. The fire, I think the threat of, of nuclear terrorism is quite real. And, and, and, and anyone who thinks that it's not, or that's just fearmongering. Um, I just think it's not, it's not reading, reading the, the books or papers of, of experts who, who, whose job it is to actually worry about this. Uh, it's just, it's just not a, uh, it's a real, it's a real problem. Uh, so, uh, the question is in the face of that, what do you do? Uh, and you know, I'm as annoyed as the thing you don't do is force everyone to take their shoes off in airports until the end of time.

Speaker 2:          00:20:38       I mean, so like we're so inefficient in how we filter. We filter and, and uh, so yeah, I mean it's a, it's, it's a big problem. That's a problem. Actually. I don't know that much about, I mean, my file on what we should do is, it's pretty thin, but it's, it's, it's pretty clear that, you know, every time I'm in an airport and I see some old Norwegian lady who obviously is not a terrorist, uh, submitting to the same search as a somebody who looks like Osama bin Ladin. Um, I, it seems like a misallocation of attentional

Speaker 3:          00:21:14       resources. So yeah, it seems ridiculous. Yeah. It's just the idea behind it. So, and, you know, what else freaks me out. I was all the fucking radiation. How much radiation of those big body scanners is that?

Speaker 2:          00:21:26       Um, I don't know. I, I, but I, I would be concerned that the manufacturers are not entirely candid about, uh, or even cognizant of, of the health effects of them. So I, I don't know. I mean, I, I haven't seen the data on them, but yeah, you want to minimize the amount of x rays you get, but every time you want to play and you get, you're getting dosed. So it's not, I don't know how it compares to the actual plane flight. How much time are you day do you think about nuclear terrorism? Because if I was as you are, you know, it's not a, it's not even every day. It's, I put it out in my mind like, like anyone else. Yeah. Well, no, it's just, it's, it's, um, the truth is, I, I believe you asked me rationally how, how big a risk do I think it is.

Speaker 2:          00:22:11       I think it's, it's a, it's a big risk. It's not a one in a hundred risk, I think. I think it's, well, that's what, you know, experts like Graham Allison think in this next decade that he wrote his book about five years ago, but he thought like next 10 or 20 year period, the chance of a, a new going off in a major American city was like 50, 50, not, not wanting a hundred. And, and so, and, and no one really criticized him for that. I mean it's the people kind of a panel of experts I think came up with 30%. Right. So it's, but again, you're not, you're not hearing the people say no, it's one in a thousand, um, 30% terrifying. It's terrifying. And, and yet I don't feel that I have, I don't really live with that piece of software humming on the hard drive very much. I haven't integrated that into my sense of, of daily risk. Uh, so it's, it's not entirely, I haven't responded entirely rational link to that information.

Speaker 3:          00:23:14       But with all the different books that you've written about religion and all the different debates that you've gotten into with people about it, I mean, you can't have a rosy view of how this is going to turn out. Do you, do you think it's possible to, the human race can pull out of this [inaudible] right now to move to the next level? Yeah, for sure. Well, I just don't,

Speaker 2:          00:23:35       the truth is I actually don't think in terms of optimism and pessimism very much. I think I'm by default, I slightly pessimistic, but, um, you got to live life and you want, we all are just sort of trying to find our way toward the high points of, of, of wellbeing and, and

Speaker 4:          00:23:56       um, I think, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:24:01       I think, uh, I think culture can change quickly. You know, that's, that's, it's, it's easy to, it's easy to, to deny how risky are our situation is. And I think that we shouldn't do that, but it's also easy to overlook how quickly we can get our act together. And so when you look at just how, I mean, the example for me is, is the change in, in, in views of race in the United States. I mean, when you roll back the clock, even 70 years, there was just a level of racism in this country. It was just, it was just unrecognizable. It's having, it's not that racism isn't still a problem, but people were being lynched and, and there would, you know, senators would come out and get their photo taken in front of the dangling body. I mean, it was, it was just insanity.

Speaker 4:          00:24:48       MMM.

Speaker 3:          00:24:49       It's amazing. When you think of how little time has passed. Yeah, it is a very good point. Yeah. We will. Racism probably is the one thing that we've made the biggest amount of progress. Yeah. Yeah. As far as culturally. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:25:01       And it's, it's, it's undeniable progress. It's, it's, and it's progress of a sword that it's very hard to pick or what would cause us to sort of roll that back. I mean, I, it feels like those are gains kind of just, just gains in terms of standing that we can't, can't lose.

Speaker 3:          00:25:18       I don't think we've fully felt the impact of the Internet on culture either because the first couple of generations who grew up exclusively with the full access to information like that, they haven't really reached adulthood yet. And once, you know, once these kids that grew up with the internet their entire life and constantly having access to new ideas that aren't, you know, not regional people that they have to talk to people in their neighborhood, people in their state. But instead of being able to talk to people all over the world and get, watch a lot of your shit online, why don't you, you know, watch a lot of different lectures online. I mean that kind of, there was nothing like that when we were kids. The impact of that generation, I think that's going to be pretty substantial when the case is now re I think that's going to be the next big leap of cultural evolution. The Internet kids when they become adults and start running shit. I think, I think it's just the attitude online. It does not mirror the attitude that that's expressed in, in, in laws. And the idea is that people have about about, uh, about our society.

Speaker 4:          00:26:14       Yeah. Yeah. I,

Speaker 2:          00:26:16       I'm a little war. I think it, it goes, it can go either way there. I think the Internet enables two very different and antagonistic processes. On the one hand, it, it does, it, it allows you to,

Speaker 4:          00:26:32       uh,

Speaker 2:          00:26:34       Hansel bad ideas very quickly. It's like, it's hard. It's very hard to lie about yourself or about anything given access to information. So that's, that's very good. And it connects and people can see how other people live. And so it's a, all of that breaks down barriers between people, but it also let it out also amplify a certain voices too in a way that never would have happened before. And these are, they're just terrible voices. So for instance, Global Jihad, uh, the phenomenon of exporting al Qaeda style Islam to the rest of the world more or less without friction is entirely an internet phenomenon. It's very hard to see that happening the way it has in the last 10 years without the Internet. Um, and just just, hey, we have these, any crazy person with his crazy idea can create a little subculture on the Internet and you have this walled garden where people can just talk endlessly, uh, in a very self confirming way.

Speaker 2:          00:27:31       Um, whether it's, whether it's a certain conspiracy theories or, or just, you know, racist, racist subgroups, whatever. And they, you just, you just get in there and you never get out and you find enough people who are echoing back your bad ideas that you and you never the other problems, you never meet these people. And then, and then also the, the, the, the role of anonymity online. I think it's pretty destructive. I mean, if you've ever read a youtube comment thread, which I'm sure you have, it's just the most poisonous Lucy's. Yeah. It's amazing. It's a, if you ran into people like that in real life, you'd want to have a sword. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:28:09       Be Hacking through them everywhere you went. Yeah. I don't, I, I see your point. It makes, it makes a big, uh, the, the anonymity makes a big difference in having a lack of any, any sort of repercussions for shitty behavior. Yeah. That's not natural for humans. It's not natural for humans to be able to affect each other with ideas, without social cues, without, you know, feeling the emotions of someone whose feelings you're hurting or you know, to be able to do it. Like this is just so, so cunty is what it is.

Speaker 2:          00:28:37       And even it's not even just inner internet comment threads or even an amazing, I, I find it with email, it's like everyone's, this is, this is now a trivial to point out, but everyone has sent the email that they shouldn't have sent, uh, and watched this even a very good relationship unravel based on the fact that there's, you're not being modulated by facial cues when you're, when you're saying, when you're dropping these bombs on your friend or your brother or whatever, and it just, it's just escalates. Oh, the other hand, it's a good way to tell someone they're fucking, that's what happened actually, to get all the information in one place. Yeah. I'd

Speaker 1:          00:29:14       be in the room with them and you know, have them argue with you about it, you know, and that sense. Right? Yeah. So when, when you look at the possibility of nuclear terrorism and, uh, you know, you're, you're a fairly young guy, you know, and you look at all this is insanity and chaos in the world. What way do you think is going to be the way out of this? Is it a technological, I mean, what's,

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       what's going to elevate people or make people's ideas evolve to the point where they realize that this idea is a completely ridiculous nuclear wars? Absolutely. A kid can't even be on the table. It can't be an option for anyone in the world. What's going to get us to that?

Speaker 2:          00:29:57       Well, it's a, it's a big question. I think one, uh, one piece of it is so accurate. It's connects back with something you said, this idea that we are the good guys and that our enemies are aren't and there's, there's not actually moral parody between the two sides and in these conflicts. I think that's still true. You know, Guantanamo Bay, it can be make it as bad as you want it. It's still true that we're the good guys in, in this particular conflict. And, um, now I wish we were better than we are and there's obviously some bad guys on our side and in any given moment, but, um, I think the one thing we have to get past is this, the kind of moral relativism that you, you tend to hear from the left. Um, and I'm, I'm very much on the left in almost every respect, but, uh, this, this disempowering idea that we, uh, so for instance, to talk about nuclear bombs, you know, we should [inaudible] what gives us the right to have nuclear bombs.

Speaker 2:          00:31:03       If, if we, if we are going to have them, Iran should have them. You know, we have no argument to keep Iran a nuclear free if we keep oms ourselves. Well, we're a very different from Iran at this moment. We're not, you know, our president doesn't get in front of the microphone and say that he's going to wipe out a turned turn a country into a lake of fire. Um, and he's not waiting for the Messiah to come back and, and, and rapture everybody. Now, if we had a sufficiently crazy president, well then all of a sudden we would have a similar liability, but we're not using, we're, we're not prone to use nuclear bombs in a flagrantly crazy apocalyptic way. And we don't know from everything. Iran says, uh, they certainly seem capable of being just as crazy as as we could fear. And so, um, that's, that's a difference that, that we have to just acknowledge.

Speaker 2:          00:31:59       And so it matters who gets the bombs. And if, if, if people who are quite zealous to die, uh, who, you know, people who are literally happy to set off the bomb in their laps, uh, just for the pleasure of setting it off, uh, that's a very different kind of mind to be engaged with. And, and it, it raises the stakes. It's not a rat there. These people are not rational. I'm not saying the entire Muslim world fits this description, but, but there are people who are not rational actors based on their ideology. I mean, they want to get to paradise. You know, they think you win if you blow the place up at the right moment. Um, and the moment take on board that certain people actually believe that, then you have to play a different game with respect to the risk that they pose a so it, so what we should do, I think we, I think we need to one, acknowledge that they're very different moments of, of tension in this world. Those where we're dealing with rational actors and those where we're dealing with, with, uh, either completely irrational actors or actors where they have an ideology that's motivating them to do things that should be unthinkable. Well,

Speaker 3:          00:33:12       completely agree with you that we have to be aware of a religious zealots and we have to be aware of a crazy people willing to blow themselves up. But you got to wonder why they're mad at us in the first place. And I agree that for the most part, I mean, I, I think our idea still sort of holds that we're the good guy in comparison to the rest of the world. Does that mean you have to be a certain amount of evil just to keep up, you know, just to compete? I mean, is that what's fucked up with our foreign policy? Is that why we go into places like Iraq with false information about weapons of mass destruction, where it was, there's a clear motivation to get in there. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:33:49       Well, I think you're right. I mean, I'm not, I'm not going to defend a rock that I think was, was a stupid war to fight. That's going into Afghanistan that just ended, you know what I'm saying? I mean that's what we're looking at. Afghanistan is the clearer case because we really, I think had to go in and after September 11th. And so you think we had to go in tits control al Qaeda cause well it was, it was rational to go in and try to kill Osama bin Ladin and, and the rest of, of, uh, the people who brought us September 11th. And, um, and it was, and we were, we at September 11th to some degree was a price paid for never having dealt with these people in the first place. I mean, they, they, that when you listen to the chatter on their side about how we were a paper tiger, that, you know, they could blow up the coal, they could blow up embassies in Kenya. They could, they could, you know, w w w we got bombed in Lebanon and we just left. I mean, so we were scared of conflict after Vietnam and, um, that was noticeable to everyone on their side. And, um, so we were, so, to some degree, this problem was just getting bigger and bigger and bigger. And when you ask him,

Speaker 3:          00:34:53       it's possible September 11th happened because we didn't invade Iraq earlier cause we didn't go in Afghanistan earlier.

Speaker 2:          00:34:59       Well, no, we didn't deal with the threat of, of Jihadi terrorism earlier.

Speaker 3:          00:35:04       Weren't they upset in the first place because we're, we, we have troops on their land.

Speaker 2:          00:35:09       Well, you gotta be precise about exactly why that's offensive when you look at why Osama bin Ladin and the rest of, of, uh, Okaydo were upset. It was because it was not because it was not a nationalistic concern of, you know, we're proud Saudis and our holy land, right. It was, this was a theological grievance. I mean, they were, Osama bin Laden was already out of sorts with, with the Saudi government at that point. And He's, um, uh, a Sama and anyone else enamored of this whole notion of global jihad want a global caliphate. I mean this, this is the idea that, that, that is, that we're living in a perverse time where Islam has been, has been delegated and subjugated and has a, has not yet triumph. And the, and it has a mandate to triumph in this world. And, and so if you really believe that, if you have to believe, if you believe that you have to fight to spread the true faith, um, for the glory of God in this life and win the game, you know, Gangas con style or more relevantly Muhammad style in this life that is, that dictates a certain kind of grandiosity and arrogance and, and expansionism and people like Osama bin Laden a really believe that.

Speaker 2:          00:36:32       And, and, but he was free to live a very different life than he, than he lived. You know, he said he didn't have to spend his time in caves scheming to, uh, to defeat the Great Satan. He could've just been chilling in Paris. I mean, he had a lot of money and a lot of opportunity. Do you buy the official story how they killed him and threw him in the ocean? Um, I haven't thought about what might not be true in it, but it seemed, I basically, I buy the, I buy the official story that we went in and killed him. And what happened to his body? I am or why? I'm not sure. I think we didn't, uh, I think it would be amazing if he was dead a long time ago and they just concocted a, a crazy hero rescue story. Jessica Lynch thing.

Speaker 2:          00:37:17       That would be, I think, I think the, uh, no, I mean, cause it would have been so many other, if you will, if you were going to fake something like that, first of all, it's just so hard to fake anything and we couldn't fake Jessica Lynch. You know, it's like, it's like you get people's, this is what's wrong with most it with helicopters, right? Yeah. And it's, it's, there's just too, eh, these things, operations like that go wrong spectacularly and everyone knows about it and they go right sometimes. And it's very difficult to fake at the Pakistanis aren't acting like we faked it, you know, they're just pissed that we actually successfully got in there. Seal team six style and, and, and got out. Um, so, but the problem with, with any conspiracy of that sort, and especially a bigger one, like a nine 11 truth style conspiracy is that it's just takes so much perfect collaboration to bring it off.

Speaker 2:          00:38:13       And we know that people are so bad at that we know that interests don't align so perfectly. We know that there's always somebody who just wants to sell their story to a tabloid or it feels guilty about their, the part they played or are they getting divorced and they just can't stop talking. And it, Bill Clinton couldn't keep a semen stain, dress out off of the news. You know, it's like, it's like, that's the simplest thing. You know, he's just like the present United States with a terrified intern and this is going to wreck his presidency. And he still couldn't keep the dress.

Speaker 3:          00:38:45       Uh, see, I see. Well he couldn't keep that dress, but how many freaks he think he banged my head as president. That guy was just whipping out his dick left and right. And that's probably why he isn't talking about it once. You're a freak, you're a freak. And when you're a freak of the highest order, where you want to be the king of the world and you know, you're whipping your dick out in meetings. Like he would meet with women and just whip his dick out and would run out of the room screaming that I did that shit a lot, but he couldn't. But, but again, we have to know about that. We know about one September 11th every other month. Yeah. But you read, um, well they know he did get a few girls. He got mad at him, hitch wrote a great book. No one left a lie to the triangulations of William Jefferson Clinton.

Speaker 3:          00:39:24       Really? He just took him down hard hitch. Christopher Hitchens. Yeah. Yeah. For about short book. It's like 150 pages really brutal. And I, and I don't, you know, I just, it's, you'll never quite think about Clinton the same way. I mean, it just, it just puts a fine point on everything you just said. And it's, it's, yeah, it's pretty brutal. He has a tinge of ego that when he talks, it always makes me wonder what he's really like. You know, and I'll say thing, you know, they have these big political speeches. They didn't do this. We did this. When will the Democrats, we did this, we did that. And you know, sort of bragging about stuff. It's like, it's very unleashed. Or like at this stage of the game when you go and look into his past dealings, like I read the strange death of Vince Foster, that's a creepy goddamn book. I'd like to go back and reread that. He's a guy who was somehow involved in that crazy real estate deal that they were with and they found him. He shot himself, but there was no blood at the scene. So it was clear that his body had been moved. Yeah, yeah. That, I mean, that's the kind of, again, I'm not saying

Speaker 2:          00:40:26       no one has ever murder, no one ever spire is, but it's just so easy to manufacture details like that that are then impossible to debunk. Like, so how do we know there was no blood at the scene? I, how do we know that some 18 year old didn't just say that on his website and now that's the meme that gets spread and now you have it in your head that there was no blood at the scene. But it's so, so much. So many conspiracies seem to be engineered by that kind of chatter. And then, but if you and I wanted to say, okay, we're going to devote the next month of our lives to just knocking down each one of those points. How would we do it? Let me see. What were you going to go to have to travel to, to find out whether there was blood at the scene and talk to people wouldn't know.

Speaker 2:          00:41:04       And it's just an endless sinkhole of energy and yet it just takes a second to set that fire. And that's what actually had happened in debate too. There are certain people who you debate on the subject or religion who know that they can start many small fires and they're given, you know, the eight minutes for their side and they can, they can set 30 small fires. We get a half trues, untruths stuff that, you know, you really should respond because it's just, it's just false. Um, but it takes you so long to put it, put the fires out that you just, you can basically put half of them out and then you haven't said any of what you came to say and then they just come back and say, well, he didn't put out fires three, four, eight, nine. And so he's clearly conceited, my points. And, and it's just a gate. It's a debating game, right? Dinesh D'souza is and egregious, uh, uh, example of that in technique. It's just if you ever see, he did a debate with, um, Daniel Dennett, uh, which was, you know, really didn't serve, uh, Dan very well because he, it was just, it was a technique that was quite effective. He just, it's a fast talker and he, he can just, uh, make a mess and it would take you an hour and a half to clean it up. But

Speaker 3:          00:42:23       I, I'm, I'm absolutely a agree with you on everything you said. But do you think that there are real conspiracies? Do you think that every one of these things is bullshit? I mean, people clearly do conspire, right and wrong was clearly a conspiracy. It might've been a conspiracy that we entered into the Iraq war under false pretenses. I mean, it might've been a conspiracy, the Gulf of Tonkin incident and Vietnam. That might've been a big conspiracy.

Speaker 2:          00:42:47       Yeah. There's no question that, that from time to time, you know, powerful people get into some star chamber and twirl their mustaches and, and conspire. I think that probably happens, but it's just hard. It's hard to bring it off. And you should never assume that's the case. And, and I mean this is, there's an adage on this, on this subject that you did never ascribe to conspiracy what can be explained by incompetence or something like that. And, and it's just so obvious. The incompetence factor in many of these situations is so high and so obvious and as it is almost everywhere. Yeah. And especially in government and with, with September 11th, it's just, it's just, I mean, the, the, it's just a, just the crushing variable that it's just, you know, we were just not, we're not prepared to deal with that kind of problem. And, um, you know, anyone who thinks this was a, a conspiracy thinks that at least hundreds, probably thousands of people woke up one day.

Speaker 2:          00:43:48       It's perfectly normal. People, people, the FAA, people in the military, people, uh, in government woke up perfect psychopaths willing without, with a clear conscience to murder 3000 of their innocent neighbors. And not just, you know, not, this wasn't Tuskegee, this wasn't the poor and disenfranchised. And you know, of a race that you're not so fond of. This is, you know, these are some of those powerful people in our society just, just blown up one day. And all of this was perfectly tuned to leave the person at the top of the conspiracy. Presumably George Bush sitting, reading my pet goat when the whole thing kicked off. I mean, it's just, it's ridiculous. It's, it's like a, and then as a pretext to go into Iraq. If, uh, first of all, it would have been so much easier to think of a pretext to go into Iraq, but why, why make it look like the w we got bombed or attacked by Saudis and Yemenis and Egyptians, which in fact is, oh, it looks so you're saying as a motivation to, yeah, I mean the, the general idea did it on purpose so that we could go to war with Iraq.

Speaker 2:          00:44:49       Yeah. If you're, if you're thinking about that sort of the false flag operation thesis that we wanted to go to Iraq and steal their oil, but then we, and we're perfectly evil and perfectly machiavellian and, and it could bring this whole thing off without any leaks to this day, you know, 10 years hence, no one has come forward and said, this is the part I played in it and I feel terrible about it. Um, and yet we botched it in these, in these huge ways where we had to go to Afghanistan before Iraq and we'd really didn't want to go to Afghanistan. No one suggests. We actually wanted it to be running around Tora Bora, um, fighting the Taliban. And

Speaker 2:          00:45:28       we go to Iraq. That worked out well. I mean the idea that that was the easiest way to get their oil. Uh, it's crazy. It would have been far cheaper to buy it. Um, but based on the arguments shape of wanting to control Iraq, I mean that we wanted to take over and control their oil, which we kind of do now. Right. But we want it so if we just wanted to go into Iraq, that that took create a let, let, let's buy the, the, the idea that people can spire and that actually certain people in our government are willing to, to run a false flag operation so that we can go into Iraq. Okay. What would you have done? You would have, you know, you would have shot down one of our planes over Iraq and, and which we wouldn't even have needed that because Saddam was shooting and our planes, we had a no fly zone and force for 10 years.

Speaker 2:          00:46:15       And Saddam was, he, the war wasn't over as far as he was concerned. He just kept shooting at planes. He didn't hit any, but let's let him hit one hit and then we then we would go in. But it just, that killing 3000 people in downtown Manhattan, uh, people who are well connected, who, who and sending are the global economy into a tailspin. It just doesn't have the right shape of it. I completely agree with you that it would take way too many people to plan it out most likely. And when I look at it, I just see it's someone's going to tell theirs. There's just too many things that have to be coordinated to many people are going to start talking. Just, I agree with you that it's much more likely in competence, but there was definitely a motivation to go into Iraq. They wanted to go into our rack already. Then it's something they had been planning on even before September 11th like looking for motivation. So it's possible, right, that this incompetent government allowed this attack to take place and then they capitalized on it. But why was, what was their motivation to go to Iraq in the first place? If they weren't going over there to try to control the oil, then why were they so desperate to go to Iraq? Because it was pretty clear that they wanted to? Well, I think, um,

Speaker 2:          00:47:24       and again, to some degree, I'm talking out of my depth here because I'm not, you know, I'm not really like a policy guy, but the argument which was made publicly at the time by, by many so-called neo-cons is that our rack, because it was the perfect test case for two to create a, a vibrant democracy in the heart of the Arab world. I mean, this is basically educated population. Um, the week completely underestimated the level of sectarianism there. Um, but again, that's easily ascribed to incompetence. I mean, we just, we were sending in 23 year old, you know, friends of Bush with no expertise at all just because they were the nephew of somebody who had donated to the campaign. And all of a sudden these people are in charge of some major piece of the machine of how to create a democracy. In Iraq. I mean, the level of, to read any of those books about what we did in Iraq is to just above everything else, just to come face to face with, with a shocking degree of incompetence.

Speaker 2:          00:48:28       So we're, the good guys were just in competent. Well, let me look who is, look who he had in the Oval Office at that moment. You know, there's a lot of words come to mind when you think about Bush and confidence is not, well, you know, bushes of strange case, you know, I mean obviously it's not a, not the smartest guy in the world, but when you look at like the policies that he put into place, it's really similar to what Obama was doing. It's not much difference at all. Right. But that, I mean they're, I think they're crucial differences, but, but one, two important things. One is that Obama has inherited the world that Bush helped make. So, so no, but Obama has got the hardest job on planet earth at the moment. You blame Bush for the whole Iraq mess. Do you? Brilliant. Or his administration at least.

Speaker 2:          00:49:14       Yeah. Well, we didn't have to go into Iraq and, and it was, uh, we could have arguably we had to go into Afghanistan. I mean, I think, I think, I think our approach to fight in the war on terror is, is, um, fundamentally ill conceived. I don't, I don't see why we need to be fighting wars and taking credit for fighting wars. I mean, this, this should, from my point of view would be all covert, all JB seals and stuff. Yeah. I mean, in so far as all of his fascination, there may be situations where that's not possible, but I don't see why we need to be a w we, we should fight the war on terror as a, um, as a crime, as an international crime problem. Uh, and that has occasional military solutions. But from my point of view, our people, you know, jihadis in al Qaeda should just have been disappearing and no one takes credit for it.

Speaker 2:          00:50:14       So why should we ever say we did it? We know. Yes, we did it. And, and now there's a possible blow back to that. And I mean, the reality is, you know, whenever you put navy seals on the ground and let them shoot they oral or drop bombs from, you know, Predator drones, you're going to be killing some number of innocent people. And that's terrible. And the terrible truth is there is no alternative to that. I mean, unless you're going to be a pacifist that you're gonna run the risk of killing innocent people when you have to fight certain conflicts. And, and so that's, I just don't see any, it's, do you ever look at it from their point of view? Do you ever low? Yeah. You try to look at it from the [inaudible] point of view, the Taliban's point of view, the point of view of someone who is watching this giant military and machine coming in and raping their country's national resources.

Speaker 2:          00:51:02       No, but that's really minerals and okay, but what's going on in Afghanistan? I think about Afghanistan for a moment. What is the point? What's the point of view of a woman in a Burka and Afghanistan? Now? From my point of view, her, it's very likely whether sheet, whether she knows it or not, there is a much better life. She could be living. You know, the, the, the average life expectancy in Afghanistan for women is 44 years. It's got the highest, almost the highest maternal mortality and infant mortality in the world. Um, it's, it's, uh, you know, most women are illiterate. It's just, it's a terrible life for women. So one of the real, real, when we think of having to leave Afghanistan, one of the real ethical problems from my point of view is we're just abandoning them to, the Taliban were abandoning the women to the, to the Taliban.

Speaker 2:          00:51:50       And, and if, if there was a way to actually help them, we would have a moral obligation to do it. The problem is it's so costly to do, it's so intrusive to do and so many people shoot at you or blow themselves up a while you do it, that there's, it's, it's completely impractical to do so. I think we have a real problem ethically till just abandoned women to getting their noses cut off because they decided not to marry the, the octogenarian that their father, uh, sold them too. Well, you know, obviously I don't agree with any of that stuff or any of those social restrictions they put on, but do you really think that we should have troops overseas to try to reinforce our moral standards on this, this country? That's a mess. I mean, should we really do that? I think we that, is that what we're doing?

Speaker 2:          00:52:39       No. No, but I think we need, well, we are attempting to do that, but it's just, it's just not doable. I do really think that's our motivation though. And went to degree. But what about the amount of money that's they're pulling out of there? What about the amount of money that they're making just in minerals? Well, let me, let me sidestep that for a second and just, just talk about what I think the end game is. The end game is to have a global civilization that actually works. And what, what would that look like? It would, it would look like more or less what it looks like in any country. And now whether you have a world government that achieves this or some, some federation of states that works better than, than certainly than the UN, you need to have, you know, if, if, if w w girls were getting, you know, their, their noses cut off a and B and being forced to live in Burkas in Florida, it would be a crime problem and we would send it, we have it, we would send in police to, to, uh, force people to treat their daughters better or treat their wives better.

Speaker 2:          00:53:36       And, and that's, that's necessary and appropriate. It's just, there's no mechanism that allows us to do that as a matter of international law. And, and so we clearly have to get to a time where when you have a hostage crisis where an entire country is held hostage by some lunatic, a or a group of lunatics in the government, uh, is the matter of national sovereignty is not an it, I mean, who cares about the national sovereignty of North Korea? That's a, that's a hostage situation. Well, that's a really interesting point because we negotiate with North Korea and we give them money and we're not even thinking about going over there. We give them money out of compassion to alleviate starvation. We going over there because they have nudes cause that what it is and they have so much artillery pointed at South Korea and the, and the distance is so small that they're nukes aside, they would just be, it would be a disaster as it, but it, but again, that's just, that's an argument for not letting these, these uh, um, failed states and, uh, deranged states get too strong.

Speaker 2:          00:54:44       I mean, that's so, I mean we, we, we need a way to, to, we need a way to convince the entire civilized world of, of, uh, of functional democracies to apply quasi global pressure to any one of these regions demanding that they get their act together. And Afghanistan is definitely, definitely a place that, that, um, where it would be compassionate if we could come in, you know, if we could get, if, if every, if, if Russia and China and everyone else could get on the same page with us and we could all agree, all right, the women of Afghanistan, we actually need to help you. So how are we going to do this? We're going to it. The, the first pass we're going to, we're, you know, any guy who's throwing a battery acid in the face of little girls because they, they want to go to school.

Speaker 2:          00:55:36       Okay. That we're going to deal with that guy a as the sociopath that he is. Um, and if it just so happens that there's a culture of those guys and they call themselves, the Taliban were going to deal with the Taliban as a, as a, you know, a gang of, of, of sociopaths. Um, but again, this is just, it's, so we tried it on her own more or less on our own and the results have been terrible. And, and the results have been terrible because of the, largely because of the role that religious thinking plays there. I mean, we, you know, you, you burn a curry, a Koran by accident and basically the war's almost over and well last because, um, everyone takes to the streets and begins killing people, uh, uh, you know, there's nothing more inflammatory than then trespassing on their religious sensitivities. And, and you know, if you accidentally bomb a wedding and kill 50 children, you don't get the response we recently got with this current incident. And so it's, it's just, it's not, we're not dealing with a culture that can have a, a sane discussion about,

Speaker 4:          00:56:44       uh,

Speaker 2:          00:56:46       the proper goals of human life and how to, how to safeguard human happiness. And

Speaker 3:          00:56:52       so in your mind, we need to be the police of the world. We're the only ones who know what's right. We're the only ones who are going to enforce it, where the good guys. And so we need to go over there. America, just the military industrial complex that runs America. I mean, what is it?

Speaker 2:          00:57:06       No. [inaudible] who's we? We is, um, well just, just look at again, take, take one piece that you agreed on are the gains we've made socially and culturally and moral a around, uh, racism. So we have, we're at least seeing the daylight on the subject of race in this country. Now we have the benefit of a kind of a running start ahead of South Africa and we see they've got their apartheid thing going on. Uh, and we begin, it takes us a while, but we begin to apply pressure to them, you know, boycott in, uh, uh, uh, trade with South Africa and, or, or, or blocking trade. And that has an effect now that's, um, if you could get the entire world on the same page on each of these questions. I mean, so the treatment of women is even a bigger variable than, than, uh, notions of race because you're here, you're talking about fully half of the human population. So wherever they're treating women terribly,

Speaker 4:          00:58:11       uh,

Speaker 2:          00:58:13       that's a, um, and systematically, and not just, not by accident, but because of some ideology that women can be treated terribly. That's a, um, that's a human rights problem that every, every society that has a robust conception of human rights can figure out how to apply pressure to. Now s stopping trade may not be enough. Uh, and, and then you, you, you have all of these other secondary effects of when you apply sanctions to a country, then the women and everyone in kids and everyone else suffer. Um, and so it's, it's, it's such a blunt instrument we don't have, we don't have good tools to deal with. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:58:53       Problems. I could see it as a justification one of many as to why a part of the world was run by bad people with bad ideas. But I don't think that's the motivation to go there. I don't think that's the main motivation to go there. I just, I don't believe that the army would act that way. That they would spend so much money to go somewhere to save some women. I don't buy it.

Speaker 2:          00:59:17       Well, I'm not saying that's the only motivation, but it's one that you think is one primary one. Well, it's, well, again, I just would have to focus on any specific conflict we're talking about. But so, but when you, when you ask yourself why they're there, so they're, they're soldiers who've done multiple tours of duty in, in Afghanistan and feel committed to the project and feel reasonably good about what they've done. Why do they feel that way? Why are they, why don't they, why don't they get up every morning feeling like they're completely wasting their life and taking massive risks for no reason at all? Well, you know, I'd have to interview each individual one to find out what their motivation was, but I look at, Afghanistan has a giant moneymaking effort. I look at how much money they're making and minerals and I don't think they send tanks and it's for save women.

Speaker 2:          01:00:13       I don't, I don't believe it's not, it's, it's not a money. It's, it's the most co these to Afghanistan and Iraq have been the most costly things we've [inaudible] we've made in people but aren't huge military companies like, like, uh, uh, how Burton and, and people that rebuild these places and people that are contractors. There's a lot of money being spent, right? Well, yeah, they're their companies make money in times of war. Yeah. I mean, so the people that do make bullets make money when they get to sell bullets. But in terms of the, um, the, the cost to our economy in general and the cost to, and, and, and, and the cost to, in the lives of the men and women are military serving over there said, so everyone who ha, who none of the soldiers are extracting wealth from the ground in Afghanistan or of course directing acting oil for.

Speaker 2:          01:01:08       And yet when you hear them talk about their experience, you, what you don't hear is a litany of, we never should have done that. That was a complete waste of time. I can't believe that our government is not true at all. I think there are a lot of people online that are soldiers, former soldiers that have a lot of those stories. No, no, no. There's some of that. I mean, it, you can't say, you never hear, no, no, no, no. I'm not saying, but, but, but the, it's not all of what you hear. What you also hear is an experience of, of really trying to, you know, building schools or building know to build infrastructure and really trying to help a democracy grow in, in these places. Now it is such a thankless job. And again, I'm not, don't, don't mistake me for being optimistic or it all sanguine about what's happening in Iraq and Afghanistan. I think it's been a disaster. And, um, but you think ultimately it's a good idea? No, I, I, well, Iraq, no. Um, Afghanistan, I think it was absolutely essential that we, we do something now. We clearly, we, we did it badly from day one who committing far too few troops and our proxies do it for us and do it badly. And Osama bin Ladin got away.

Speaker 3:          01:02:23       But you see it as a war of culture. You see, I get bad people out of control,

Speaker 2:          01:02:29       a country that they could potentially be dangerous to us. It was worth the preemptive strike. Well, again, let's just start talking about the big picture. If you're, if you're a pacifist, you think we should never do anything like this. You as you never pull out a gun. And start shooting or threatened to shoot because nothing is worth killing for now. I'm not a pacifist. I think if we all took a Gandhi and response to these problems and just, you know, got on our Facebook page and made a lot of noise, um, that there are certain enemies we could have and do have who will just inherit the earth. I mean, so the thugs will win. In that case, um, Gandhi, Gandhi's nonviolence worked against the British because the British were the British and they had enough of a conscience not to just kill everybody. It wouldn't have worked against Hitler. Um, and uh, and Gandhi actually knew that. So, um, so the, if you're not going to be a pacifist, then we're just, then the question is just when do you pull out the guns? Uh, and we can then have an intelligent discussion about whether it made any sense to pull out the guns, these of Iraq or Afghanistan and um, and you know, then, then it's just a pragmatic question of, of, of when you do it and how, how you, how it's best to do it.

Speaker 3:          01:03:52       I can agree with Don. I can agree that we need guns because they're bad people in the world. We need an army. We need a military because they're are bad people in the world. But then when you look about our actions that define what, what our purposes with this army, look at our two main campaigns, Iraq and Afghanistan, you've admitted they're both complete fuckups and disaster. So if that's the case, how do you think the rest of the world will look at us? Why wouldn't they be upset with us? It seems to me that these campaigns have done far more to hurt the way the rest of the world wants to treat us. The name thing else we could've ever done. Gone. Going to these places and blowing up buildings and killing whom and how many hundreds of thousands of innocent people died in Iraq. And how many people are dying every day in Afghanistan? W do you think about the numbers that have been piled up just to the actual raw statistics as, as motivation

Speaker 2:          01:04:42       for these people? Well, I think it's had paradoxically has had both effects. It has. Um, because look at, if we didn't go in to certain situations, so it's like a, when Libya was kicking off the, the resistance was desperate for us to come in. And we looked at that, the kind of the, the mealy mouth, the approach we took just sort of letting our allies to take the lead. Um, that looked a little bit like cowardice and, and we got a lot of grief for not actually being active enough to help, help prop up the, you know, the, the Libyan, uh, that's a pretty case.

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       You've got a guy's been a dictator forever. And the people

Speaker 2:          01:05:20       literally, it was the same case. People were not riding in the streets because he was a better dictator. I mean, it's like we, it was worse, arguably worse in Iraq. Uh, there were more reasons to go in. The people were, um, there was every expectation that the people, uh, enough of the people were ready to be rid of Saddam, that we could have been graded as friends. And, um, and yeah, it was a disaster because for mainly B, because we underestimate the level of sectarian violence that was, was going to begin the moment we took the lid off. And, um, I mean, again, that's just, it just incompetence but it's not, it's like, so when you, when you have Sunni Muslims who are going to blow up a, she a mosque, people who didn't even know about that before they went into the, well, a lot of people didn't know you know it, but we didn't even know the difference between Sunni and Shia. Yeah. I mean that we hate you had, you had, you know, there's, you know, bloopers of, of our, uh, you know, White House press conferences where, where they're getting people's affiliation wrong and not even thinking they're interchangeable.

Speaker 3:          01:06:30       Do you think that these debates, if you've had with all these like fiercely religious people, have they given you more of a pessimistic thought or idea on how, how we need to handle people in other parts of the world where their entire cultures are run by religion? I mean, does it, do you use, do you like lose a bit of hope for rational conversations to the point where you're like, you know what, you have to engage militarily, there's no other option, so you're never going to get by with debate. You're never going to get by with rational thought. You never going to get by with reason. You're talking about cultures that want to murder you for burning some pages accidentally. You're talking about culture that wants a murder you for drawing their guy, right?

Speaker 2:          01:07:13       Yeah. Well I think it's not, it doesn't, it's not partitions so easily by state, but I think I view it as kind of concentric circles. So it's, so again, we're talking about Islam here for the moment. You have this sort of the center of the Bullseye of doctrinal, crazy global jihadist Islam where yeah, I think, you know, al Qaeda and al Qaeda, like thinking that's just a deal breaker. I mean it was a word war with that subset of the Muslim world and the, and they are not our idea that we're at war with them. They're at war with us. They'd answer. We're talking about it. We're innocent. We've done nothing. We've done, we have done, they are running a very different game in their heads. It's not about land. It's not about the Palestinian does not about it is they're living. They've got, they've got these seventh century or 14th century goggles that they've, uh, looking at the world through.

Speaker 2:          01:08:08       And you know, if we, if we pipe bay watch over on the satellite dish, that's a, you an offense that they're willing to die for. I mean we w w w it's a, it's a very different game they're playing there. You got to imagine what it's like to really believe in paradise. You know, to really want to get there, to know that, that if you blow yourself up killing infidels, you're going to get there and you're going to get everyone you love there. And then there's just this velvet rope in front of Paradise and you're going to walk right past cause the angel's going to lift it up for you. And the way to get there is to be a jihadi. You know, it's, it's like a, it's a, it's the ultimate. It's like being James Bond, who's going to get 72 virgins in paradise and you end, you have got no other problems in life.

Speaker 2:          01:08:56       You need to worry about, you don't have to worry about getting education or getting a job or making it work in this world are building a civil society. You just have to play your side of the game, right and die in the right circumstances. But how many of those are there? How many? I think, I think there are enough. Well, I think there are, I mean, there are tens of thousands of people who went to training camps in Afghanistan. Um, so again, so, so concentric circles. So the center of the bull's eye, let's say that's just, let's say that's half of a percent of the Muslim world. Okay. Which is the timing. So when that, whenever you, half a percent is a, you know, a 1% of humanity is schizophrenia. I mean, so half a percent. It's a tiny segment of any, any population. Th there's, there's, there's no idea.

Speaker 2:          01:09:47       So crazy that only half a percent of Americans believe in it. If you ask people. Yeah. Yeah. So you're going to get more than half a percent. It's just it. So, but even half a percent. Um, what does that, it's like, you know, it's millions of, of of people who are just the die hard of the die hard now as 1.4 billion Muslims. Um, so, so you think it's possible that half a percent of them? Oh No, I believe. I think so. I think it's for vogue is worse because it's all, let's say, so let's say there's, there's potentially, let's say there's potentially a million jihadis, right? I think it's probably worse than that, but let's say, yeah, let's just see. Let's say it's you, but when you see, just be defined it, you, you mean guys who are willing to become suicide bombers more than a million? Well, I think that that wouldn't be a crazy guest.

Speaker 2:          01:10:38       I mean, I have, I have no way of knowing, apart from the fact that, that you're, there's like in any and every Muslim country, it's 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, depending on the country, up to 70%. Who thinks suicide bombing is a good thing. Wow. Right? So it's not the, these are when you, when you run the poll in, in, in, you know, which has been done by Pew and other organizations and you started asking people, do you think you know, uh, uh, suicide bombing in defense of Islam is ever justifiable. And, and then it's, you know, yes, sometimes, rarely and never are the possible responses. The, the, the number of yeses and sometimes gives it gives you a, a, if not a majority, a significant minority of, of every Muslim country. Even in, even in the UK, you would get something like, you know, 20, 25% of, of, of young Muslims thinking that it's justifiable and you'd get that immediately after the suicide bombings in London.

Speaker 2:          01:11:42       These polls had been run, you know, do you, do you want to live under Sharia law? You get like 30% in the UK among Muslims, 18 to 24 now. So, so one question is, do people actually believe what they say they believe when, when you are taking a poll and, and what does it actually mean to say yes to that? How does that inform your life? So let's just style it all the way down to half a percent. Okay. Everyone else's just bluffing, half a percent is still with the spread of, uh, of weapons of, uh, of, uh, high yield. You know, whether it's nuclear weapons or biological weapons, um, half a percent of any popular, any significant population, it can do a lot of damage. And so we, we just, it's something that we have to win a war of ideas ultimately. And we have to, we have to discredit these ideas so that the next generation doesn't find it so easy to believe these things. But,

Speaker 3:          01:12:41       but how did they accept us? How do they accept anything, any real solution coming from us when they know what we did in Iraq, when they know what we did in Afghanistan, when they know what a fuckery we've made out of the whole thing, when they know how much rampant corruption there is, when they know how much missing money there is, how do they ever look at this as anything other than a money grab? How do they ever look at it as like, oh, these are the Americans are going to teach us how to live. How could anybody except that? Well, it's not, but when you look at, again, it's just necessary. It doesn't matter how the accepted, we just have to do it anyway. When you're talking about the center of the

Speaker 2:          01:13:13       Bullseye, uh, these people are truly on persuadable. It says there was nothing we were going to do that was going to get Osama bin Ladin to say, you know, I had you guys all wrong. This is, you know, the eye. This is, we're friends now and, and uh, um, so I think a certain percentage of people are on persuadable and they're the force or the threat of force is the only game to play. And then what we have to do is win a war of ideas around that first circle where they become marginalized, sufficiently marginalized and, and, and not supported within their society. So, so, and that arguably that has happened to some degree, even with how chaotic Afghanistan and Iraq, uh, look.

Speaker 3:          01:14:03       Well, there's certainly been more penetration than there was like 50 or 60 years ago, but the majority of the population is still like really deep into their culture. I mean, they have a weird setup. They only have one city cobbles the only real city. Right. And Afghanistan has just filled with like tribes, right? Essentially.

Speaker 2:          01:14:22       Uh, yeah. Yeah. I mean, I, I haven't been there, so I'm, again speaking, I've only read third hand, but a bunch of, yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:14:29       Mccain talk about it. Where he, I think, believe one of his quotes was that it's run the same way as it was when Alexander the Great was around.

Speaker 2:          01:14:36       Right. Just at the end, some of that tribalism isn't strictly a religious problem. It's a, I mean, the toes, tribalism is a problem and religious tribalism is a problem. And, and these are, you know, these are

Speaker 4:          01:14:47       mmm.

Speaker 2:          01:14:48       Any ideology that fundamentally divides one group from another and prevents them from recognizing their common humanity as a problem. And so not all of that's religious. Some of its racist, some of it's tribal.

Speaker 4:          01:15:00       Um, but

Speaker 2:          01:15:02       the role that religion plays in confounding this, uh, our, our, our best intentions. Even so, even, even if our, even if are, we only had our best intentions and they were not mingled with our worst intentions, even if it was not about if, even if we would just go into Rwanda to help people, even though they don't have oil and we got no national security interests, but they take out the machetes and start killing their neighbors and we just, we're going to put our lives on the line to just stop the violence.

Speaker 4:          01:15:29       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:15:29       It's the, the problem is, it's just this, there's no elegant way to do it. You wind up killing us and people you wind up, uh, you can't, you can't commit enough resources to build a civil society. You can't, it takes too long to, to teach people what they should want. You know? It's, it's just, it's, um,

Speaker 3:          01:15:52       so you sort of reconcile our problem. You sort of reconcile our military actions. You reconcile the corruption, all the fuck. I'd be saying all the fuck ups that they are, what they are and there's nothing we can do about them now. But what's important is we keep these crazy people from developing nuclear bombs and from attacking us cause they're, they're very real possibility of, of nuclear terrorism to you is far more important than whatever mistakes or corruption has been, you know, has, has that we've put out as a, as a country that have gotten, gotten these people to have this sort of a perception of us.

Speaker 2:          01:16:25       I think what, well, I can't, yeah, I can't sign on to all of that because I think our screw ups have been huge and, and I think we, we have a huge moral debt to all the people we have accidentally blown up. I mean obvious obviously collateral damage is a huge problem. And, and I think we are.

Speaker 4:          01:16:47       MMM.

Speaker 2:          01:16:49       And it's been a problem in every war we've ever fought. I mean, one of the things we, we've now, which is an advantage on the one hand, but also disadvantages that there's so much more transparency. We know so much more about the bad stuff we do. Whether inadvertent or not, that if we didn't know this in World War II and more bombing Dresden and incinerating hundreds of thousands of people, um, got an innocent bystanders for, for, for the most part, um, and not, you know, nonmilitary targets. And we could know, arguably we should never have done that, but we've arguably couldn't do that now given how much info given, given what the images would do to us on the nightly news. And so, um, and I think that's all to the good. I think we should, I think we should understand the cost of war more than we do and we should understand how horrible collateral damages more than we do. Um, how, how'd you feel about wikileaks? Well, I think, I think, uh, a song has just, it'd be he's a cult of personality. He's a creepy bastard. So it, so it's hard. It's hard to, I mean, I, I'm, I like transparency, I think, I think the, the journalistic aspect of it to some degree was legitimate, but I think it's also, if you're going to release, uh,

Speaker 2:          01:18:08       certain secrets shouldn't be released. So there are certain secrets are there because they're keeping people safe. And to release those secrets, uh, irresponsibly is to put people in harm's way. And so it, so I, it was a, it's a very mixed, hey, do you feel about the initial video that he released collateral murder, the one that showed the guys and the helicopters shooting the people on the ground? Yeah. Well, children and them saying, well, I shouldn't have brought their kids. Right, right. Well, the thing that's horrible about that is the, the, um, horrible but, but maybe inevitable is that we're just not wired to

Speaker 5:          01:18:46       okay.

Speaker 2:          01:18:47       And understand the consequences of our actions once we can fight war remotely. You know, I mean, you have a, if we were just fighting every, if it was all just, you know, bayonets, there's a, there's the kind of the, in a, in escape ability of the horror of war. But the moment you can fly something, you're sitting in your, in your office park and outside of Las Vegas and you're flying a Predator drone, or if 13,000 miles away, um, it's, uh, I, I'm, I'm not this, I'm not suggesting those guys don't have a hard time sleeping at night, some of them, but it's a very different kind of violence. And, and one of the scariest things about technology is it uncouples us from our, our emotions, from, um, the reality of the consequences of our actions so that the most harmful things aren't actually the most disturbing things, you know, so, so, so if you miss an example, actually I used in, um, I think the end of faith know, if you hear that your grandfather fought in World War II and he dropped bombs.

Speaker 2:          01:19:53       He was a fight. He was a, he was a bomber pilot. He dropped bombs over Dresden. That's one kind of level of abstraction of a, of his actions that it's, it doesn't really disturb you about him. And it needed to have disturbed him. And he's, he's at 30,000 feet dropping bombs, not really getting what he's doing. But if you hear grandad killed a woman and her kids with a shovel, all of a sudden he is the scariest guy who ever heard of. And probably he's couldn't sleep for the rest of his life either because it takes a very different kind of person to do that. But the guy dropping bombs killed farm any more women and children than the guy with a shovel. And, and, and so, so that, that um,

Speaker 1:          01:20:34       it's fascinating isn't it? And then now we're moving into drones. Yeah. And she'll lose even more. So we need,

Speaker 2:          01:20:40       the burden is to figure out how to have an appropriate emotional response to reality and to be guided by, it's not to say that our emotions are always the, the, um, uh, perfect guide. I mean there, there, there may be ways in which we are wired to have a strong response to something that we should just get over. And, and we're not wired to have an appropriately emotional response to something that really is, is a massive danger. And, and so our perception of risk and our perception of harm is not what it needs to be for us to, to, to make intelligent decisions and compassionate decisions in, in these kinds of conflicts.

Speaker 1:          01:21:23       Did you agree with the video being released? Did you think it was a bad idea?

Speaker 2:          01:21:28       Um, for morale for, it's hard to separate that from everything else that that has happened. But as far as wikileaks you mean? Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, I think wikileaks, I truth is, I don't even know the ultimate consequences of wikileaks. I, you know, it's, it would just, it would just matter what the consequences are. There isn't transparency. Good. Yeah. But to a certain point, but do I think Obama should be forced at his next press conference to just share his White House briefing with the world? No, I think he, I think he, there are certain things that I understand that he and people like him need to know that I don't need to know. And if, if I knew and blogged about it, I would be harming our national security. Um, so, so yeah, no, I'm not for the just unlimited distribution of secrets. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:22:20       So you allow them to have certain secrets just for national security. Well, it's just a clearly we absolutely need that. We would be paralyzed. I agree with that. To what your sure. Absolutely. Right. If there's bad guys, but to what level? Like at what point, how do you know that's where it's weird. How do you make the distinction? How do you decide that, uh, you know, they shouldn't be able to have, you know, a certain secrets that may in fact be damaging to American civilians or meet, we might disagree with it. It might change the way we feel about a president or our policy. It's probably not that complicated. I don't think so. No. It's probably pretty basic. It's probably like, all right, we should definitely not tell him about our, uh, where nuclear warheads throughout the United States are located everywhere. Yeah. You would think so. But I think there's a lot more complicated than that.

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       Yeah. Well, again, there are trade offs between some of these things where it's just there, it's hard to really be satisfied that you've hit the right answer because it's, it's the cell, for instance, going through security and in the airport there's this issue of fairness, you know, and there's this issue of intelligent uses, use of attentional resources. So the fairness would say, yes. Fris Frisk, the 75 year old woman who looks like she just got out of her evangelical church just as much as you frisk the guy who, who just prayed on his knees to Mecca, um, before passing through security. It's only fair to be blind to those, uh, otherwise salient differences between them. Um, but it's stupid to when you know that the person who is going to blow himself up on the plane is a jihadi and not a, an ordinary looking old woman.

Speaker 2:          01:24:04       Um, so again, you see what are the consequences of being starkly unfair? You know, where you just profile nakedly and say yes without apology. We profile if you, if you're Muslim, we are going to subject you to a heroin search at the airport because we're worried about your brothers. Um, we, we, we have to find a balance. We're struggling to find a balance between those two things. And, um, I think we, we're in the current environment. I think we're wise to err on the side of being fair. And, and I mean, I think, and I think you would, you would, you would want us to err in that direction to be fair and to be transparent and to be, but that's what's so scary about something like nuclear terrorism. One thing has to happen and all of a sudden are, we'll all be desperate for a level of security that will radically transform our lives.

Speaker 2:          01:25:02       And it's so, and it will be, again, it could be completely out of scale with the actual damage. So you know, if you, if a new queen off in Los Angeles and killed 100,000 people, right? So a small nuke until 100,000 people and rendered, you know, some area uninhabitable for Awhile. That would be such a, a rattling event that it w we would all be demanding huge changes and we would be forfeit in our civil liberties. Happily it with both hands as was clearly evident after nine, 11, after nine 11. Right? This would be orders of magnitude worse and yet it would be rational to say, well listen, you know, 400,000 people died of heart disease last year, you know, no one is forfeit in their civil liberties are going nuts over that figure. We're talking about a hundred thousand people, uh, who, who, you know, what, what is the real risk we're talking about? Well, there's this sudden death over [inaudible] self administered death. Even if that would be

Speaker 5:          01:26:05       okay,

Speaker 2:          01:26:05       even if we, uh, I'm not saying that's the right way to look at it, but even if you could show a commensurate body count from [inaudible] from some other source, um, actually bill morrow wants made this point where, um, I think he was talking about Hurricane Katrina. I say, well, look at, look at what happened with Hurricane Katrina and the billions of dollars in, in cost and a thousand lives lost. If a terrorist had done this, we would, we would completely freak out as a nation because it's the weather. We basically can't get our act together and, and don't really worry about it. Um,

Speaker 5:          01:26:40       okay.

Speaker 2:          01:26:40       That difference in response is uh,

Speaker 5:          01:26:45       okay,

Speaker 2:          01:26:45       well something we have to be cognizant of. And so one reason, one rational reason to Pete to, to want to protect against certain, especially salient events like nuclear terrorism is because

Speaker 5:          01:26:59       okay,

Speaker 2:          01:27:00       we are guaranteed to overreact in such a way that it, the consequences will be a horrendous, I mean, just economically consequences. That's a very good point. So your point is cut back on civil liberties so that we don't have to cut back on in the future when the shit hits the fan to some degree. That's an argument. You're not, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, but, but cut back on them. And again, I wouldn't phrase it in terms of cutting back on civil liberties, but, but I,

Speaker 5:          01:27:28       yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:27:28       it comes back to, to, to moments like airport security. For me, it's like how much security do I want when I get on an airplane? I want intelligence security now intelligent. I want, I also want fairness, but, and I'm willing to put up with a certain level of, of, um, inconvenience to, to, to, to know that basically this is being done. Sanely now do I want huge inconvenience? Do I want to be bombarded with rays? Do I want to, you know, I'd want to have take my clothes off every time I got on a plane. No, but, um, it's just, you just, we have, as a society, we, eh, there's something very corrosive about the, the signs that,

Speaker 5:          01:28:12       okay,

Speaker 2:          01:28:13       these efforts are ineffectual and not being done intelligently. I mean, if we could all just see, uh, an airport security protocol that just looked right, you know, where it's just, you know, then I think everyone would understand why we had to do it, but it looks so wrong and it feels so wrong. Uh, and

Speaker 5:          01:28:34       okay.

Speaker 2:          01:28:34       It doesn't feel like it's improving. It's just like there's figuring out the system better and this is an easier way to do it. Less intrusive. There's no easier way to do it. And I'm not even putting myself, it's like I'm not, you know, fine. You know, I don't actually, look, I don't think I look like I'm al Qaeda, but, but I don't, look, I, I'm not as benign a, I mean, I once saw a little girl when this, when we first got the, the, the shoe bomber effect and a, we were all having to take off our shoes. Um, I saw, you know, I saw a three year old girl in her, you know, whatever, whatever those, I'm one of those black and white shoes that little girls were called jellies, bugs. I don't know. There's some little older school name. Anyway, she was like holding up a line.

Speaker 2:          01:29:21       Her, she was being forced to take her shoes off. She was terrified. It's like a first flight, you know, and like the parents were being traumatized and it was just, it was just the most insane, insane, misapplication of, of human resources. Um, and meanwhile that was a flight where I had accidentally taken, uh, a, a bag that I used to keep a gun in and I went through security with, with a double hand, a handful of bullets just inadvertently. Right. So I, so I'm getting through with bullets and they're looking at, at this girl, like she's, you know, the, uh, she's Okaydo. So of course Al Gore got frisked. Do you remember that? No, but Al Gore made a big deal out of it cause he was flying commercial and right on, I'm one of these flights and he got, he got frisked. I was like, what does, that's not symbolic demonstration of fairness.

Speaker 2:          01:30:14       Yeah. Yeah. It is. I guess at a certain point in time that you got to come on, you think the ex president, the x vice president is going to become a suicide bomber was really, is that what we're looking at here? Yeah. Yeah. So that it's that kind of thing that I think is, is corrosive. And, and, uh, the, the, the missteps and failures we've had at the level of foreign policy and in fighting wars have been corrosive for the same reason. It's just the ineptitude and the, and the, the [inaudible] acknowledged and unanticipated costs and it's all just, um, yeah, it's, it's very hard to be idealistic or feel like anything is being done right. But again, think of just what Obama's got to deal with when he drinks his first cup of coffee in the morning and he's got, he, they're getting information from a world of intelligence, which is, is, is struggling to quantify certain risks.

Speaker 2:          01:31:08       And there is no question that there are people who are desperate to blow up whole cities in this country because not because they have said they have a long list of rational grievances against our foreign policy, but because they're fighting a cosmic war. And that's just, that's just something we have to absorb as bizarre fact s as it is. So you think for most people it's almost impossible to sort of understand their mindset, to really put yourself into their shoes. It's virtually impossible to really have that kind of a crazed, I don't, well, I didn't mind it actually. I feel like I can put myself in their shoes. I, you know, if I read the Koran and I read the Hud eighth and I read what, what, um, people like Osama bin Ladin say about their intentions, what and why they're doing what they're doing. You Watch enough, you watch a few suicide videos, um, you know, last testament videos of, of suicide bombers.

Speaker 2:          01:32:10       You just have to imagine what it would be like if you really believed that this was the structure of the universe where this human life that we, that people like us really value is just this, uh, irredeemable fallen, uh, uh, really revolting circumstance of, of separation from God. And it's just this anti room to the better place that, that you get into if you live this way and die at the, in the right way, at the right time. And eternity awaits Aternity where all the good people get get to be happy forever. Wait, now why would you want to stick around here? I have to talk about this more, but I also have to pee. So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to put my headphones down and I'm going to ask you about question when we get back though. How the fuck does anything get fixed? How do we fix this? If you were the grand social engineer of the universe, think about that. I will follow you. So now, but now what do we do while you Pete. Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:33:20       Hey, how's it going? Sorry, I'm just readjusting everything.

Speaker 7:          01:33:28       Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:33:28       Um, so is this something that you fell into? Like did you, uh, like think like this growing up or did you have somebody that inspired your, your, your beliefs in the way that you, that you think and like your, your, I guess your stance on everything, you know, or did, have you always been interested in it or,

Speaker 2:          01:33:49       well, I've always been, I've been interested in, um,

Speaker 7:          01:33:53       okay.

Speaker 2:          01:33:54       Religious experience, right? I mean, why, just what it means for people personally. And just what the possibilities are. You as a, as a teenager, I just, you know, I was as interested in just what is, you know, what are the limits of reality as anyone else. And so to some degree, my research there has been scientific and now increasingly scientific. But early on I just, I was interested in religion as a possible account of, of what's true. And, um, I was also interested in the kinds of experiences that the founders of, of the world's religions have had or seemed to have had. So I'm interested in the kind of experience that would get Jesus talking like Jesus or Buddha talking like Buddha and, and I, I've sought those experiences with drugs and meditation and, and um, it's very, it's clear, absolutely clear to me that there is a range of experience there that is hugely motivating and real and accessible and has been traditionally described only in religious language and seems to cash out the crazy claims of, of the various religions.

Speaker 2:          01:35:06       So like, so if you're, if you're a devout Muslim and you start having the kinds of experiences that we've had on acid or the that that people have had intensive meditation retreats, um, they get framed in very much in doc trinal ways. So it seems to justify your infatuation with this one revelation, a revelation which is intrinsically divisive, which argues that you should hate everyone who's not in the fold. Um, so clearly we need a way of talking about these kinds of experiences and valuing them that is, which is, which is just as generalizable and scalable as uh, the, the, the larger conversation of, of reason and science based thinking about the nature of reality and is not in print and therefore it's not in principle divisive.

Speaker 3:          01:35:58       One of the things that Mckenna always said in describing the difference between religion and a psychedelic experiences that the psychedelic experience, you don't have to believe anything to go on it and you'll, you're going to experience it whether you like it or not, you're going to get hit by it. How you interpret it and how you disseminate it inside your own head. It's one thing, but it's not like a religious experience in that you don't have to believe. Oh yeah. Which is probably the beauty of it because you know, the ego wants you to hold back to all in. You can retain all control of your faculties at any given time. And you know, you don't want to relinquish control to some sort of a foreign substance, some sort of a drug, some sort of a thing that you know you're going to give up your whole body and your mind for three hours. Fuck that. That's too long. And that if that freaks people out, yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:36:40       it freaks me out. It freaks people out with good reason because there is, there is a chaos factor to psychedelics, which you don't get doing yoga now. I mean that's, that's, that's their power and their, their peril. Because the, I mean, the other thing that Mckenna said, um, which is obviously quite true, which is that if you teach someone to meditate or you're teaching them to do yoga, or you teach them to, you tell them to do whatever spiritual discipline you think is so potent based on their talents are based on their happenstance or, or nothing might happen. I mean they, they, they just might get bored. They, it doesn't matter if they do it for an hour or a week, it's not necessarily gonna move them. But if you give them a hundred micrograms of LSD or, or a sufficient dose of anything in that family, um, there is just no question something's going to happen. Now, it could be very pleasant. It could be very unpleasant. It could be mixed, but there is, there's going to be a break with their ordinary consensus trance of egoity and um, so it's a short cute, so it's a huge shortcut. But the problem is it does just sort of just puts you in a, and you're not quite sure where it's pointed and then you're, it's, you're going there.

Speaker 1:          01:38:00       So it's a method. But you think that a meditation is probably an equally effective method if you, if you really follow it through. I mean, I think, I think of meditation the same way I think of martial arts. You know, I could, I could teach you a spinning wheel kick, I could show you it and you might not ever be able to do it right. You, you might not have the flexibility, the coordination, whether it's mental flexibility might not be able to focus on it enough or be intense enough or spending, you'd be disciplined enough to stretch yourself enough to pull something off. But you can't say that another person can't pull it off. It is possible to pull it off. It's possible to be an expert at it. But now to all the people that you teach this, you know, like couldn't Bellini or some intense form of meditation where you achieve altered states of consciousness, how many people are going to have the focus, the drive, the discipline, how many people are going to put in the time and the numbers to actually pull off an altered state? I have never done it.

Speaker 2:          01:38:50       Well, uh, I completely agree with that, except there's one caveat, which is I think that the center of the Bullseye of altered states of meditation is not so altered. It's not, it's actually the, the, the thing that you want to realize from a, from a contemporary point of view

Speaker 2:          01:39:12       is not actually the same as the full kaleidoscope of effects you get from psychedelics. It's not just, and this is a distinction I made, I think, again, in the end of faith between, um, uh, the content of consciousness and realizing a specific property of the nature of consciousness. And there's no question that, that, that cause for ordinary waking consciousness, like the content, the spectrum of content is, is trimmed down. I mean, we have, you know, there's just a kind of a feeling of it's because it's all solid and it's just me here in my body, I'm kind of locked in my head and see you over there. And now there's no, the, the, the, the energy of the situation is, is, is quite, um, limited. Uh, yeah. And, and they're not too many surprises. I mean, we have all kind of been taught neurologically to just perceive or ourselves in the world. You give someone LSD or psilocybin or Mescalin, and that begins to change radically. And it changes for everyone. And it can be terrifying. It can be incredibly blissful. Um, eh, but what happens is people are flooded with new content and new feelings of meaning a new field and new, uh, um, just the energetics change. So will they tell you, put your hand on a tree and you feel like the buzz of, of kind of living in contact with a tree and which you have never felt in your life.

Speaker 5:          01:40:46       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:40:47       All of that kind of, the more aspect that you get with psychedelics isn't what isn't the point of meditation. And it comes with meditation. So if you go on a three month retreat where you're just meditating 18 hours a day, and every time your mind gets lost in thought, you'd come back to the practice, whether it's, you know, mindfulness, you're like the Pos and the meditation or whatever it is. It could be yoga that, you know, being in a pressure cooker of intensive retreat can give you that some experience of more, I've never quite had it. Like what you get in a psychedelic experience, how close we've become.

Speaker 4:          01:41:26       MMM.

Speaker 2:          01:41:27       Well it's not, it's not the, um, you can certainly get what you get with MDM may, I mean the like the full blown, empathic, unconditional love real thing happened. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. Wow. Um, and they're actually practicing within Buddhism. There are practices that are just tuned to that. So the practice of loving kindness called Metta in Pali, it's just, you're just, you're just trying to stoke that emotion and it, you're just, you're just thinking, it's, it's, it's a very simple practice you, you bring to mind, people you love. You're not, not romantic love, but just people who you just, you know, your best friend say, and you just meditate on that person and you just think, Eh, you know, thoughts of well wishing for them to see it as you. May you be happy. May you be free from suffering May and just, and just connect with your wish for that person's happiness. And you just train that up. The crucial piece is once you get concentrated, once your mind is no longer wandering into the, into the, um, into the chatter of just distraction and you can actually focus, you get the feeling going and you can focus on the actual practice, then you can do it. Then it would just be, it gets kindled and then you're, you're feeling very much what you, you feel, uh, uh, on ecstasy where there's just this,

Speaker 4:          01:42:51       mmm,

Speaker 2:          01:42:54       it'd be it, it becomes, it becomes like, like ecstasy the moment you move it off because you start with someone who's very easy to love, like your best friend. Um, and then, then the, the practice evolves and then you move it to a neutral person and then you even move into an enemy. Um, and so, and then so then you get it. Then it's just broad spectrum. You know, three 60, I love, I wish everyone happiness. That's the goal of the practice and, and but, but wishing with a totally focused mine that is not lost in thought. Uh, it, I mean the truth is just having a concentrated mind that's not getting lost in thought is just intrinsically pleasurable. It's intrinsically blissful. It's sort of, it's like the, the emotional base note of all the good drug experiences. It's like, it's sort of kind of the, the, the opiate happy feeling comes just with concentration.

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       It doesn't even matter what you're concentrated on. If you're just concentrated on a, my Buddhists do practices where they'll just focus on a colored disk and they, they reach levels of concentration was, so you're just focusing on a piece of a swatch of red and you're, you're, you're, you're reaching states of consciousness that are just extraordinarily blissful and, and, but again, that's not, that's not the ultimate, it's not the ultimate point of meditation and constant concentration is just a tool to use to actually glimpse something about the nature of consciousness. And so that, this comes back to what I was saying before, that the, that the actual goal, and this is, this is a difference between just getting more content and, and getting the kind of the wisdom that comes with, with, um, recognizing something about consciousness. The goal is to recognize that ordinary consciousness without anything getting psychedelic is a circumstance of genuine freedom.

Speaker 2:          01:44:57       That the, that the, the sense of being a neurotic self locked in the head, uh, worried about what other people are thinking that can be cut through fully so that it's, it's just gone. I mean, so that you can recognize the intrinsic selflessness of consciousness and that can happen without any of the pyrotechnics. It can happen without the, the rush of energy in the body. It can happen without the colors changing. It can happen. It happened without any luminosity of any kind of says you don't feel like you've taken a drug. You're, you're, you're, you're, you're awareness is crystal clear. It's, it's, it's, it's compatible with ordinary behavior. You can drive a car. You can, if someone says, can you pass the salt? You don't, you're not this dazzled, stoned person who can't find the salt you, you're, you're fully here and integrated and yet the center has dropped out of experience and you can just, only the world remains in some sense and you're no longer on this side of it.

Speaker 2:          01:46:03       Look, assessing personally or even just even that the sense of subject, object perception and even just, it's like there's, there's a way of looking at, you take any object and there's a way of looking at it as an object where I feel like I'm over here looking at it and then there's also a way of still seeing it. But Lou scene, it's so clearly that you're no longer, you're no longer the sear, you're no longer the law on the outside or the on the inside looking out. There's just seen, there's just a totality. If this is some karate kid type shit, you're like become the cap. That's what, no, no, it's not becoming the cab. It's just become, the world becomes come. Whatever you focus on, yet it becomes become the church become re most of us feel like we are having an experience. Like there's, there's our experience, there's the world of our experience, and then there's us over here having the experience, you know, like we're on the outside looking in or we're looking over our own shoulder.

Speaker 2:          01:47:09       Uh, there's a distance, there's a subject, and then there's all the objects and it's possible to collapse that distance. You know, in a way that is, doesn't require any psychedelic explosion. And that is the, from a meditational point of view, that that is, that's the center of the bolt side that you want to, you want to find that intrinsic property of consciousness. And then you meditate on that and then you just, you drop your distraction and you fall, you fall back into that space of just being open and aware. And then it doesn't matter what happens then. It doesn't matter whether you feel blessed or you don't, you're not waiting for the meditation and get good. You're not trying to have an experience that you had yesterday that you know that you lost and you're trying to get back to it. I mean that's also all of the seeking, the tends to come and people's spiritual lives where they're just trying to get some place.

Speaker 2:          01:48:04       That's the irony is you know, the, the seeking is your problem, you know, see you trying to become happy trying to positing a goal and then seeking it. Uh, from a, from a contemplative point of view, is the trap that you want to avoid? You mean as far as like behavior is concerned? I mean, as far as, I mean, you don't mean that as far as like goal setting in life, right? No, no. I mean there's, there's certainly a place for goal setting and how do you have this attitude and still write your book? No, no, I mean it was it possible. Yeah. No, no I'm not, I'm not, I'm not nullifying all purpose based behavior obviously, but, but from a contemplative point of view, like, so the question is what is available to realize now in the present moment that is liberating. It's like what? So, so it's just, just me.

Speaker 2:          01:48:52       Neurotic may unhappy me, me who's disappointed with yesterday. What can I do right now to be free? Is that even possible? Does that he, does that question even make any sense? Now some people would say, well, that doesn't make any sense. You know, there is no, there isn't. You are just a monkey or you're just an ape with various needs and desires and, and you can be as happy as you can be, but there's just, there's nothing really profound to be realized about the nature of consciousness in the present. There's just you think believing in certain things, wanting certain things, etc. And that's just not true. Now it's completely rational that many people think it's true because they haven't had certain kinds of experiences. But, but the truth is that, and this, this is a truth that that inconveniently for our sake is only really ever acknowledged in the context of religion.

Speaker 2:          01:49:52       The truth is there actually is something more profound to realize about the present moment and you get one look at that truth through the psychedelic experience because it's just you being neurotic and someone hands you a tab of acid and all of a sudden you are a wash in an ocean of new content. That is, is completely profound. And, and I mean, you've had no idea. Life could be so rich, rich. Now if you have a bad experience, you have, but you have a bad experience and that's, that's something else. But if you have a good psychedelic experience where you feel like Jesus that proves to you that is possible to be much, much deeper and happier and fulfilled than you, then you realized.

Speaker 3:          01:50:43       I read that you had had a very similar experience, uh, to me, uh, when you, the first time you did a Mtma [inaudible] and, um, that was a real behavior changing experience for me. And I remember the, when I did it, I really couldn't, couldn't stop thinking after it was over. Like, why can't people be like that all the time? What an incredible world it would be if people thought like that all the time. It would, anything ever get done, I don't know. But, you know, boy, human interaction would be blissful all the time.

Speaker 2:          01:51:14       Yeah, no, I mean, and again, I keep feeling just a civic responsibility to, to bracket all of my um, uh, enthusiasm for psychedelics with the warning that I think they're, some of them are more just biochemically, more risky, are riskier than others and some are just psychologically risky and it's possible to have a bad experience and to really regret taking any of these frozen.

Speaker 3:          01:51:42       Well if you have a hard time with reality, I say stay the fuck away from psychedelics,

Speaker 2:          01:51:46       but he, but even if you don't, or even if you've had nothing but good experiences, you can suddenly start having bad experiences. I mean, that was my course I took, I took em to Mtma a few times. I took silicide been a few times. I took acid, you know, a dozen times or so. And I had for the most part, just especially with with Lsd, I had 10 perfect experiences where afterwards it was just, it was unthinkable to me that anyone ever had a bad trip. I didn't even know what that couldn't even see the direction you would head to have a bad trip.

Speaker 3:          01:52:24       Did anything change in your life before you had the bad trip?

Speaker 2:          01:52:27       I don't, I don't, I don't know what the approximate, cause it's insecure, but it's just, but then I think this is, I don't know, I don't have any science to go on here, but anecdotally I think this is a reasonably common experience where once you've had a bad trip, then the door is slightly ajar there and you can, you can, you know, you see, you can find your way there in a way, kind of reliably. Um, so I, I approach psychedelics with more caution now and I, you know, it's been years since I've, I've done anything. Um, but it's not that I wouldn't, it's not that I wouldn't do it again. I probably would, but I would just, I would pick my moment wisely because I, you know, as good as the good trips were, the bad trips were just as bad. And, and it's, um,

Speaker 3:          01:53:14       so the legal situation is very unfortunate because if it was legal, then we can have people that were experts on it that were professionals and they could distribute it and they could do it properly into the right environment. And we'd have, you know, protocol and, and, and the, the correct things to do if someone is having a bad trip and they're in the, you know, the safety and comfort of professionals and people that can let them know that everything's gonna be fine and sort of steer it in one way or another. You know, that's all something, the, the, the potential growth experiences, we're, we're all missing out on those because of the illegality of it. But I agree with you that you should be really careful, but anything you do, especially, I know people that they just, you know, they get on Xanax and they lose their mind.

Speaker 3:          01:53:55       You know, I know people that just things that seem to be mild and acceptable. I know people can't drink. You know, that every, everyone's mind is very different biochemically, the way it reacts to two different substances. You know, some people can't smile. I've, we were talking about this before. I know people that have given them pot and they swear there's something in it. They, well this is not pot. This is, you're drugging me. And so, no, it's just pot man. It's just, you're, you're, you're set ups different. There's a certain amount of immunity that I've developed that you, you don't have tolerance rather. Right. Um, I think it's really unfortunate though that we can't experiment with these things if they aren't like, uh, you know, at a university level. But this isn't like

Speaker 2:          01:54:33       normal people are quietly doing research on basically everything now I think. I think, uh, I don't know if there's anything that you can't do research with at the moment, but it all is pretty quiet. But they're doing an MDA research. And actually the, um, I'd, that I was at Ted and someone who's somewhat close to this research told me that the, they've been having such success with two sessions of Mtma therapy for PTSD, that the, that the military is now looking at it using MDA for Mgma for, um, yeah, I'd heard about the two or like two or three sessions protocol, which sort of, I think the jury is still out on the, the neuro toxicity of Mtma. I think it's, I mean, this, there, there've been studies on, on, on both sides, but if it's just two sessions and you get some huge response rate for PTSD, um, and that, that's where it gets around the neuro toxicity questioned because it's not, it's not so toxic that you can't do it a few times or even a few more times than that. Um, but yeah, so, so anyway, I, I'm not a psychedelics or we're truly indispensable for me at a certain time in my life in terms of just, I was so I was a hard enough case and skeptical enough that there was anything worth realizing through introspection that it took just getting hurled over the wall for me to realize that there was any, any more to the world. And, and, and so, and, and then that gave me a basis from which to practice meditation and, and kind of look into these things.

Speaker 1:          01:56:14       What do you think is happening in the psychedelic experience? I've heard the broad spectrum of, you know, you're just changing the brain chemistry. You're adding in and add a different element that creates hallucinations. And because those hallucinations, you know, you get these profound feelings and you can learn and grow from those feelings too. It's a radio and you're tuning into another life form that only communicates with you through eating it. It's from another planet. And that's why there's a logos. That's why when you take especially high doses of mushrooms there, you'll have people, community, you'll have a language, whether it's internal or not, you don't really know. I mean, it could all be, you know, how much of w if you can see any of that stuff. I mean, how much of that is just firing against the different parts of your brain that causes, uh, causes visions? I mean, what do you think is happening in a psychedelic experience?

Speaker 2:          01:57:04       Well, let's say, so I blogged about this. I wrote an article, a drug, drugs in the meaning of life. And, um, and so I, I'm in a footnote, I differentiated those two kinds of psychedelic experience because there is this, there is the one experience which is, um, again, personal, even if it's even if it's trans personal, it doesn't put you in dialogue with anything else or it doesn't seem to put you in dialogue with anything else. Um, and that's the only kind I've ever had. I've never had the experience where you're, um, the Terence Mckenna style on now in the presence of the other talking and receiving information that, that I couldn't have had it any other way or it could, don't think I could have had any other way. So the, so for people who have had that experience, it seems rational to say that, that it's putting you in touch with and other, in some sense, it's not just you, it's not just an expanded you or just the universe without you be without your ego involved.

Speaker 2:          01:58:11       It's actually putting somebody else's attention on you and now you're in dialog. Now that's, cause that's an experience I haven't had. And so I can't really that, but the thing is that the test of the validity of that experience, it's pretty straight forward. I mean, if you're, if you're getting information that you couldn't have any other way, that should be provable. And one of the things, one of the, the, the, um, the fishy things about Terence has account of, of these states is that at many moment he claimed to be getting, he really did claim to have a compelling experience of being in dialogue with kind of omniscient other, you know, so he would, there was, I don't know if you read his book true hallucinations. So He's, he's in the Amazon and he's walking around and he's, he's had more, um, mushrooms than, than any person in human history.

Speaker 2:          01:59:04       And, and he is in dialogue with, with, um, it's a very, very readable book, very fun read. Um, some very, uh, out there ideas in there. And, and so I'm going to summarize, I'm going to, I'm going to falsify by summarizing what he was claiming to be in dialogue with, but he's in dialogue with some Omnish and other, um, and it's just so he's pointing to a species of plant that he doesn't know the name of his cube. Terrence was very, had a lot of botanical knowledge, but he, his point, his point of plants that he doesn't know the name of and he claimed he's just getting the Latin name in his head beam to him by the other right now. That would be a, he, he, it's been a little while since I looked at the book. But if you're of a scientific frame of mind, you actually want to establish whether this is more than just your experience.

Speaker 2:          02:00:00       That's the kind of thing that you, it's very testable. I mean, you could say, listen, I had, you know, I didn't know any of these plants and I've never taken a course in botany or get, I'm going to give the same dose to someone who I really does know what I really know. It doesn't know a damn thing about botany. And we're going to see how many of these species of plants he can name. Um, and that's just, I mean that would be, it's, it's a, it's as easy as testing psychic phenomenon and an ordinary sense. And if you could attach it is scientifically, if you could just get information, one unique experience though. I mean, but, but it's just a member of any of those names. He, yeah, he didn't so, so Tara, Tara's was so smart. Um, but he, you know, he was not the most rigorous, uh, at the margins of his rap on what is real, you know, he was, he was more poet than scientists when he would, when he would get to some of these crucial moments.

Speaker 2:          02:00:57       And so, um, yeah, I haven't seen in his work any effort to be really rigorous and say, okay, I had this experience where I was getting information that I know was not my own content. It was not based on prior learning and it was not just merely imagined. It was real information. And here is how I went about trying to authenticate that, that, that it was real information because he talks about just being able to close his eyes and see, not, I mean alien civilizations, obviously that's hard to authenticate, but you know, see historical periods and see, um, he said, yeah, yeah, no. Yeah. So he was, he would, you know, because Evan, it wasn't some of his, some of his talks. Oh, he's probably high as fuck. Yeah. So, so obviously it's, it's possible to be completely stoned and have these wild experiences that are basically just dreams right now or hypnogogic images and, um, unless you can bring back those Latin names. Yeah. If you can't, if you can't bring back something that's clearly information, then my feeling is there's no reason to claim that it is. You can claim that this is the one thing that what's indisputable is that people, people can have a range of experience that is incredibly beautiful and life changing.

Speaker 8:          02:02:18       And then

Speaker 2:          02:02:20       a certain percentage of people feel the need to tell a metaphysical story about the significance of those experiences. And, and religion is in the business of enshrining specific metaphysical stories as the ultimate truth. Um, we know they can't all be true because they're all mutually canceling. Um, which is to say of Christianity's true Islam is false and vice versa.

Speaker 8:          02:02:43       Uh, but

Speaker 2:          02:02:46       the psychedelic experience falls into the same, uh, under the same rubric. I mean, you can have all of these experiences and not know what they mean and be very humble about what they, you know, what you don't know and still value the experiences or you can say, oh no, I, I'm in contact with the pleiadians and they live in a star system and they're sending messages, blah, blah, blah. And then you, then you're just part of the cacophony of new age, uh, claims that are, that are unsubstantiated. So, uh, I didn't know that he had claimed that, that said, it's really pretty funny. But one of the things that he did claim was that he was high on mushrooms and they were communicating with him, telling him to create a map of time out of the Ching. And it's something the whole time wave. That's another thing that just, you know, he, he played some mathematical game with the, the end date, right?

Speaker 2:          02:03:40       Uh, the king when sequence and the itching and uh, I don't, I don't think he did it. I don't think he was alone for this. I think he found some mathematically talented or crazy grad student to help him with this game. But he got some pattern of, of um, what, you know, but again, you mean how you define novelty? It's so sketchy and yeah, I never wanted to go down that particular rabbit hole with him. Um, but yeah, if the world ends in eight months or whatever it is, uh, as he predicted or the same dictating the singularity happened or something huge that he, what he predicted is the, the asam tonic achievement of novelty on December 21st, 2012. Um, uh, whatever that means, it's going to be the most novel day and the history of the universe and, and nothing, nothing be the same. Um, so if December 22nd dawns and basically what we've just had another news cycle and, and it's just Fox News versus CNN, um, we'll know that that novelty theory was, was wrong. Um, and then there'll be the percentage of devotees who just think it's kind of time shifted in some, you know, well there's a way.

Speaker 1:          02:05:01       Hello. Cause he was such an entertaining speaker and I think that was really a big problem. The problem was that he was so entertaining and engaging that, you know, he sort of was a prisoner to his gift and his gift was to tell these compelling stories and if the story wasn't so compelling, well you move things around and make it compelling. And unfortunately, I really found out recently because of people in my message board kind of eliminated this to me. He changed the end date is December 21st, 2012 end date that he always said was that he magically arrived at with his mathematical program, which was to the day, the same end date of the long count of the Mayan calendar. Right. He, Brian, you gotta throw that fucking stupid clock away, man. That shit's annoying. Ridiculous. Meow cock. You're a grown man. Um, but apparently it was really a November. It wasn't, uh, his, his original, his original calculations were in November. Well, and then when he found out about the end date of the Mayan calendar, then he just shifted it a month. No, which is so convenient. Right? But this is ridiculous because he used to say to the day, so he was a great speaker. It was, I mean, really, really cool ideas. A lot of fun to follow. But when you do that much, you know, reality must become like a slippery fish in your hand, you know, really, really difficult to constantly have control of.

Speaker 2:          02:06:19       Yeah. Yeah. No, that is a bit of a liability when you say it so well you can get carried away with just the, the, the experience of, of saying it that well and to, and to some degree is true with writing. I mean, you can have, I think Freud's influence is how is outside influence. It's outsize influence, which is, um, kind of inexplicably given how crazy some of his ideas were, um, is born of just the quality of his writing. And he was, Freud was a great writer and, and uh, it's just, um, I mean the whole mythology he created for what's going on in our head. Fascinating. Fascinating. But it, so it's like a, you know, it's so much of it is, is cocaine base should have been obviously bogus, but he was a damn good writer.

Speaker 1:          02:07:10       Yeah. Well to this day, people, you know, talk about 40 and slips, you know, that there's somehow knows deck going on in the back of your mind.

Speaker 2:          02:07:18       Well, it's not, the thing is, I mean mother and there are, there's a lot of unconscious processing going on. And I mean, this is actually the subject of my current book, very short book on free. Freewill is, speaks to that. That it's just the sense that we have of being the kind of, the conscious authors of our thoughts and actions we know is false. Now. It's not false in the Freudian sense that we've got the ID and the superego and the, and the ego, uh, uh, at war. And it's all being driven from behind by a kind of intelligence that's consciously editing, uh, what we can consciously know. But there's just that, there's most of our PR what of what's going on in the brain is unconscious and most of it's not even potentially conscious. And, and that actually explains a lot of the change you get with psychedelics because what you change the biochemistry enough.

Speaker 5:          02:08:17       Okay

Speaker 2:          02:08:17       you, you are, you're playing with the margin of what's conscious and what's potentially conscious. And we are potentially conscious of a lot of things we don't tend to be conscious of and that it completely transforms our, our, our experience. But there's a lot that we're not just potentially conscious of that the brain is doing. And it is, it is everything we are conscious of is dependent upon all of that work. So for instance, the fact that you are hearing my words as words right now because you speak English and I'm speaking in English and you're parsing the, so I'm making sounds and you're just, you're not making any special effort to hear words. You're just hearing words. In fact, you couldn't not hear word if you tried and it just, the words are coming and you're understanding them. And I'm going to get to the end of this sentence sometime and we'll both recognize that it was more or less grammatically correct. All of that.

Speaker 5:          02:09:08       Okay.

Speaker 2:          02:09:08       It's happening unconsciously and you're not. And, and

Speaker 5:          02:09:13       okay,

Speaker 2:          02:09:14       you're just conscious of understanding what I'm saying or not based on whether I'm following the rules of English grammar or not, but I'm not a, I'm not aware of what's allowing me to follow the rules. You're not aware of, of, of what's allowing you to detect my errors. Um, and the truth is from a conscious perspective, I don't know how I get to the end of the sentence. And this has really like all of this, this experience of talking is riding a top of machinery that I can't inspect. And when it fails, it's a, it's a surprise and I don't know why it failed. And so that's, that's just talking about parsing speech. But all of our, all of our thinking and behaving and wanting and doing all of our, our inner life is made

Speaker 5:          02:10:02       of, of, of

Speaker 2:          02:10:06       unconscious processing of that sort. And so their experiments where you can show that people, people, when you think you have consciously decided to do something, your brain is actually committed to doing it half a second or some seconds before your, before you, why you still think you're making up your mind. So this really nullifies a conventional notion of free will because you're, you know, if you say, if you give me two buttons, push and I can push either one I want and I can push them when I want and you just tell me to make up my mind and I go back and forth and back and forth and say I'm going to push the left one. Which completely free choice. I did it. No one forced me to do it.

Speaker 8:          02:10:47       Okay.

Speaker 2:          02:10:47       The truth is if you were recording from my scalp with EEG or, or looking with Fmr, I at at a brain function,

Speaker 8:          02:10:58       you could detect that

Speaker 2:          02:11:01       before I thought I was committed cause I, cause in these experiments subjects watch a clock and they, and they, and so I'm like watching the hands of a clock or watching random numbers appear on a screen. And I looked and I, my only goal is to just look at when I've decided when I'm committed, I go, I go back and forth between left and right, left and right, and then I say, okay, that's the hand to the six. I'm going to go left. All the experiments show that that for some decisions, several seconds before we could tell from the brain what whether, whether the subject was going to go left or right.

Speaker 1:          02:11:36       So your subjective sense of being truly upstream of your decision making process is, is a false one. The only problem I have with that is two fold. One is that if you're going to study something like that and you, you, you know, you, you, you make it clear study where you're, there's a red and a green and you have to make a choice as to which one and you monitor the subject's brain. Is that real? Is that real life? I mean, it's a fucking test, you know? I mean, how do we know what's going on in a real life scenario? How do we know that there's not a lot of overthinking going on? How are we now? There's not a lot of shit going on behind the scenes like in, in this sort of a situation because you're a, you're, you're setting up this test, right? To can, can, could psychedelics change free will if a psychedelic experience changes your whole tune? Could it, could it literally change what, what decisions you would automatically make? I mean, if there is no freewill of freewill is just your mind for whatever reason goes left or right based on morals or ethics or what feels right or what feels wrong in that sense, wouldn't psychedelics be able to change free will? Well, I think freewill is, is a truly incoherent, crazy words. It just doesn't make a placeholder.

Speaker 2:          02:12:44       We have, we have causality and, and no one has ever described a way in which mental or physical events can arise that make sense of this idea of freewill or of being the true locus of the causes of your thoughts and actions. And, and this is, most people think that we have this,

Speaker 8:          02:13:02       the,

Speaker 2:          02:13:03       it's a mystery here that we have this subjective experience of freewill, but we can't map it on to a notion of physical cause and effect. But I think if you've looked closely, you realize you don't even have this objective experience of free will. So if I ask you, you know, think of a, a, a, an MMA fighter. Okay. Okay. So did you get one? Yes. Okay. Who'd you think of [inaudible] Saint Pierre. Okay. So now why didn't you think of Matt Hughes? Uh, okay. Now, until now, whatever story you're gonna tell him about his menial, right? So the truth is you're not in a position to know why you thought of George St Pierre. Right? And so, so, okay, there are all these MMA fighters whose names you know, and you know them as well as, you know, George Saint Pierre, his name, you could have thought of Overeem or, I mean there's a hundred you could have thought of, right?

Speaker 5:          02:13:55       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:13:56       You, let's say you thought of a few and then you settled on one to tell it for the purposes of telling me what you thought of since he got Hughes and you got over him, you guys Saint Pierre and then I said, well who was it? And you say, well Saint Pierre, right? You can't explain why you fixated on him as opposed to Hughes or whoever the other candidates were in your mind. All of that's being driven from behind unconsciously and there's no way to ever, even if it wasn't even if there was no time lag, even if we knew that the, the neurophysiology and the, and the conscious thought were truly simultaneous. So there was no part of your brain that was going George Saint Pierre before you are aware of it, right? It's still a mystery as to why it is what it is. Right? But that's sort of a, an answer to a question with no consequence when it comes to something with consequences and their freewill.

Speaker 2:          02:14:44       Then when someone contemplates the, you know, the results of their actions. And I mean is, isn't that what we really truly consider to be free wills? You look at something and you so should have hit this old lady with my car. No, I should not because I have free will. I mean, even if there was, you know, some sort of a decision that had, you know, green lit in your brain, you know, seconds earlier than that, no, we're not going to run over this old lady. Sort of that's freewill, right? I mean, what, what leads someone to murder someone? Is every murderer innocent because they don't have freewill? Are they a accumulation of their past histories and our emotional responses to various stimuli, good or bad in their environment that's led them down this road. And here they are in this moment in time and this physical altercation and they murder somebody. Do they not have free will? Right. Yeah. So all good concerns. Um,

Speaker 5:          02:15:31       okay.

Speaker 2:          02:15:31       Clearly there's a, there's a difference between voluntary and involuntary action and, and so we can talk about that difference without ever invoking freewill. So they're, they're the things I choose to do and I'm reaching for the water because I want to pick it up. And that's different from me accidentally knocking it over or, or so, so, and, and those differences matter. So if you intentionally shot me, that's one thing. You're a murder and attempted murder. Um, if your, if you accidentally shot maybe cause you were cleaning your gun, there was no intent and that says a lot. You're a very different person in the world. You're not the person who intentionally shot me. Um, so we don't have to worry about you in the same way. Um, so for, for the purposes of our legal system, the difference between intent and, and, and lack of intent is huge. But it's huge because it says a lot about what someone's likely to do in the future.

Speaker 5:          02:16:24       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:16:25       That the payoff is that,

Speaker 5:          02:16:28       yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:16:29       there are

Speaker 5:          02:16:30       one, I think understanding that, that the incoherence of freewill does subtly change your, your morality and would change our legal system in, in small but crucial ways because okay.

Speaker 2:          02:16:46       Changes your morality because you have to acknowledge that there's a huge role. For luck in this world that, that that is morally relevant that we don't acknowledge. So, I mean, you are not responsible for the fact that you have your genes, that you were born to this, this society that you've had your life experience, that you're brave. You, you didn't make your brain, your brain isn't exactly the state it's in based on Noah. You, it's not an accomplishment of yours. Right. You and Andy,

Speaker 2:          02:17:17       you can't take credit for the fact that you're not a psychopath. You are lucky that you're not a psychopath. On some basic level, you would be unlucky to have the genes and the life experience that would make you want to get up tomorrow morning and kill kids. Do you think that cycle, that, that sort of a pathology is inherently genetic, do you think that know better mental, whether it's combination. So it's a combination. It's, it's significantly genetic, but so was a combination of environment, but you didn't pick your environment. Right? Right. But it's not something that someone can avoid based on a bunch of different circumstances. Yeah. So, so I'm not negating the role of human effort and human intention and we can change ourselves. We can, we can get in shape, we can learn new skills, we can, we can improve relationships. This is everything about what people want to want to do with their lives, um, can be conserved.

Speaker 2:          02:18:04       But the truth is some people are much luckier than others. I mean, it's like, and, and, but, and no one can take credit for the fact that they're intelligent, that they're good looking that there, I mean, it's, it's like, so say this, but what about the secret, correct? Yes. Yes. That talk about the dangerous nonsense. Did that drive you crazy when that was, you know, was, was all coming out that was a oh yeah, it was, that was the most irresponsible thing in the world from Oprah's Oprah, Oprah, Oprah is boosting of that book. Was, was, uh, journalistically irresponsible in the way that, that, that few things, it's amazing watching people run with it though. People that were convinced that all of a sudden they were going to create their life with their imagination. Right. But sort of, there is some sort of an impact that your thoughts in mind have on the real world.

Speaker 2:          02:18:51       Oh No. It's positive energy. Psychic energy. There's something there. Yeah. If you're a nice person and you're thinking nice thoughts about people, they're going to notice that. And like you, and that's, that becomes a self fulfilling loop. I mean, you were like, if you, if you are an angry person who's always noticing what's wrong with the people around you, that that's, that's very hard to keep to yourself. Right? And people began to treat you a certain way and it becomes self. So you think it's an entirely social pointers of a thought? Well, I, there is not, I wouldn't attribute any spooky level to it. It's all, it's all understandable. Um, you've, you ever seen like mass prayers where they work on a certain, you know, thing and, uh, you know, everybody together try to pull up their energy that, well, that's, it would be so it would be so easy to demonstrate and, and there's been so much prayer.

Speaker 4:          02:19:48       MMM.

Speaker 2:          02:19:50       That Ha. I mean, it's just, it's, I mean, this is what the great, um,

Speaker 2:          02:19:57       the website. Why, why does God hate amputees? I mean it's it because it's so, so you have all these people who believe they've been healed through intercessory prayer of their cancer and all these other diseases that are self limiting. You'd never hear somebody up here. If somebody who's prayed to grow back and arm and said, look, you know, here's a picture of me without an arm. And now they're both back on the, on like the human salamander. You, if prayer worked, you'd be able to pray for lost arms that you say that. But what a prayer only works a really tiny bit and you go, you have a lot of people involved. There's boosts your immune system. No, I mean it's just not, it's not perfect. It's not magic. Is there, is there power in thought, but it is billed as magic. Yes, it is billed as magic, but every once, okay, God, if we're talking about God, I'm talking about groups of people praying for things I'm talking about using their energy of their thoughts.

Speaker 2:          02:20:48       I'm not really talking about invoking a higher power, I'm just stopping up. But no, but they think they are. Maybe it was just making it a with art bell, you remember that child? Our Bell? Yeah. Coast to coast. Werewolves at three o'clock in the morning when you're driving on am radio. I believe he did some sort of a chest where he tried to, they tried to influence something, whether it's weather or something with, you know, a gigantic MindMeld off. But it wasn't, it wasn't a religious thing. I think the idea was it can you get a bunch of people to concentrate on something and do we have like the most minute ability to influence things and together we could do something measurable. But I dunno if anybody ever do anything. A lot of people who have done research of that kind and what they claim is just that these, these micro departures, these micro effects that when you aggregate them over many, many trials represent huge statistical departures from chance and met.

Speaker 2:          02:21:45       Most people in the skeptic community find that completely unpersuasive because you looked into it at all like random number generator. And I've just, I haven't, apart from just reading a couple of books like Dean Raven's book on the conscious universe, um, it's what you come down to. There are just Meta analyses of someone's statistics and the, the concern on the part of skeptics that, you know, there, there are frauds involved or there's just a file drawer effect where people are not reporting their failures and they are reporting the, the, the, um, the positive results. And so, um, there's just what you want, what you should be able to find is if these are, if these are, if these are real abilities that that really matter in terms of, you know, tangible results tend to, you should find someone who can come into the lab and demonstrate telepathy or clairvoyance or whatever the thing is you're interested in.

Speaker 2:          02:22:42       And so, so that it's really, it should survive the presence of a skeptic like James Randy, who's a professional magician who knows how to fake these mentalist games. Um, you should be able to test it in. So I actually have short, I spoke to Rupert Sheldrake about this one's cause you do, you know, sure. Residence. I said he's a big advocate of the scientific testing of these phenomenon, but he's very, um, he's a believer. He's a, he's a, he's a, he's a real believer and you know, he's, he's published essays or, or articles on, you know, pets that know when their owners are going to come home. And so he's got the camera on the dog and the owners headed home and he's got it them times sinkton showing the effect of the dog getting up at the right time. And he's very into the idea of democratizing science where you can get thousands of people doing these tests on their own and, and, and, and, and showing some effect.

Speaker 2:          02:23:45       Uh, but what he hasn't wanted to do is just actually submit to James Randy's challenge of showing up and doing an experiment that will survive the, the, the scrutiny of professional magicians. And I'll just allow this thing to be, and, and I, it's just, you know, people find James Randy's skepticism so unpleasant that they, that they think that that would nullify the experiment or somehow, or they're not going to submit to it. But I mean, James, Randy has put up $1 million to anyone who can show some positive result. Um, now I no doubt he's not the easiest guy to deal with. If you actually, you know, if you are a, a, a committed to the reality of psychic phenomenon and you have to go in and meet with James, Randy and, and design an experiment, um, I'm sure he's gonna he's, uh, he's going to make you jump through hoops that you feel like you don't have to jump jump through.

Speaker 2:          02:24:40       But yeah, it would, it would be trivially easy to design a valid experiment. They could demonstrate these, these effects. And so I'm open minded that, that this stuff is possible, but it's, it's, it's fishy that he hasn't, it just had taken the people should just come forward and, and, and demonstrate the effect. Well, what is rel Rupert's claims? I mean, is it, is it, you know, that every single time Rupert Rupert's claim was that, that, um, he doesn't think science should be decided by contest. Essentially. It's like, it's, it's not, that's not how you do science. You don't do science. To answer $1 million challenge put up by a magician. And that's a okay. I, the kind of the his aesthetic objection. Or is interpersonal objection to working with, with a cranky person like Randy, but I'm cranky, not in the, in the flaky sense, but cranky just in the, you know, he's a, he's a confrontation.

Speaker 2:          02:25:37       Yeah. He's confrontational. Um, but given how the whole field of Paris psychology and you know, cy studies is treated like intellectual pornography given how discredited it is in the, in the view of, of mainstream science. If there's an effect there and you've got a protocol that has demonstrated it, just come forward and do it. Do it in every context where you can shine light on it and, and, and just prove it. Um, and Sheldrick has never done this, not well, not to anyone's satisfaction that, that, um, that, that can move the conversation forward. And he says he, you know, there's many people who say they've done it, but when you actually look at what they, what hasn't happened is you haven't, you haven't discovered people with, with where there's a really strong effect where you get one person who's like, you know, the tiger woods of, of mind rating, where you were, where they can actually show a departure from, from chance.

Speaker 2:          02:26:39       That is huge in, uh, in their own trial. What you get is if you get 6,000 people staring at a random number generator trying to make it depart to the high side as opposed to the low side, you get people saying that there was this tiny effect. So it should have been 50, 50. It was actually 51% over all those trials. And that when you do the stats on it is a, you know, you would expect a one in 10 billion due to chance. That's just, um, that's subject to many kind of experimenter, uh, problems that, that, that people are right to worry about, which is one you didn't, I mean, people have been caught not reporting their failed experiments. I mean there's, so there's a kind of a true believer syndrome that happens even in certain things. I mean there's, there's a, there's a phenomenon of scientific fraud across science, which is a problem we guard against. But, um, it's also been true of, of pair of psychology as well.

Speaker 3:          02:27:40       Do you think it's possible that people have these certain senses that have not evolved yet? And that that's why like sometimes you know, you know, someone's going to call you and you pick up the phone and it's them. You know, there's weird non duplicate a bowl that's on a word. There's weird experiences that you can't duplicate. You know, there's, there's, there's random weird things that can't be controlled, but sometimes the, the right frequency kicks in and you catch a radio station from San Diego when you're in San Francisco and it doesn't make any sense. And it only lasts for a little while. Is it, is it possible? Do you believe? Like, have you ever had personal experiences where you know, you knew someone was staring at you and you looked

Speaker 2:          02:28:22       and they were, you knew the phone was gonna ring and a dead. Oh yeah. It's all bullshit. Well, no, it's not bullshit, but a huge component. And perhaps the component that explains all of those experiences is what's called sampling bias. Where are you? You notice all the hits and you don't notice that the non hits, you don't notice all the time you pick up the phone and you had no idea who was calling you, which is most of the time. Right. Um, and this was before caller id. Obviously caller ID has, has, has, has ruled out the psychic phenomenon. Um, but so we're not, we're just, we know, we don't keep track. We w one w w the hits are salient to us and the, and the failures aren't, and so, and religious people do this all the time. God always gets credit for the good things he does, but he doesn't get scored for all the, the disaster as he fails to prevent.

Speaker 2:          02:29:16       So, you know, a bus crashes and everyone's dead except one little girl and it's a miracle. It's God's miracle that, you know, she walked away. But what about all the dead people? So of course, um, and so the, the non hits always out weigh the hits and if you actually do, so the, and the, the classic demonstration of this, which is still shocking to people is, is the, um, it's called the, the, the hot hand fallacy and basketball, the idea that people get on a shooting streak, you know, Michael Jordan, he would shoot two outside jumpers and when, when he goes up for his third, there's this sense both in him and in the audience that he's actually more likely to make that third shot. Having made those pro prior to because he's, he's just on a roll. So that whole feeling of being on a role in basketball has been studied because, uh, what's amazing about professional sports like basketball is, is these statistics are like every single game that has ever been played.

Speaker 2:          02:30:18       It's completely broken down. And that we know what we know every shot and every, every, you know, uh, a basket and every rebound. And so, so statisticians could just sit down and analyze, is there such a thing as the hot hand? Is it actually true that if a guy has made three jumpers in a row, he's more likely to make the fourth or as the fourth truly independent of everything that's gone before. And they just, they found that despite the personal experience of being on a roll and despite the fact that we feel like we've all seen someone on a role, there's really no such thing as being on a role in basketball. Now, there may be other sports where it's different, but there's so much, there's so much chaos and so much uncertainty in once that ball leaves your hand, uh, it's, it's, it's a, it's a low percentage enough phenomenon that it is actually insensitive to statistical analysis.

Speaker 2:          02:31:11       No, it's, it's insensitive, insensitive to the fact that you feel great and everything's going well for you and you just sank two baskets and you go up to sink a third. That third is you're no more likely to sink that third. Then you were a, if it was your first one and you're, or you would just, or you just failed to, to, to you, you just missed two and then you go up for the third. So do you completely discount the players comfort like when they feel like during the zone that doesn't exist? I mean, what is the zone state of mine that created having an experience? So what's amazing about this is this is no one's ever more likely to make a basket. Is that what you're saying? A quarter now they're confident and they make the basket knowing that they're going to make the basket.

Speaker 2:          02:31:49       Statistically you say that that doesn't, there is no sign of a, and this, again, this research is probably, it's probably 10 years old or so. So you know, maybe something's happened in the last decade, buddy land just fucked up the whole thing. Right, exactly. But my, my understanding is there is zero evidence of, of what's called the hot hand in basketball. So that it literally, it is a, it is a subjective error that everyone feels powerfully. And so given that, and it says, just map that on to all of our psychic so-called psychic experiences where you feel like you knew someone was going to call or we're just just luck it. Yeah. It's just, it's just there's gonna be some, how do you know though? How do you know it's just luck? How do you know it's not either or? How do you know it's not well, cause I'm ty was tested a brief buddy.

Speaker 2:          02:32:39       Yeah. It shouldn't be just testing it. You're by caught by placing the experiment on anything, don't you automatically alter the results of it? Especially we talking about something. So a theory is an idea of a friend and then boom, there's an email in your box. You haven't talked to them in years. I'm just playing devil's advocate here because I don't believe in it. Listen, I've had to, I had, I don't know that I don't believe in either. So here's a, here's a, here's one weird experience like that that I've had, which, uh, may statistically it seems a completely beyond the pale, but it's, again, there are going to be low probability events that happen every day. And, and, and so, you know, I, I know a guy who went, for instance, his college girlfriend, uh, when broke up with him and went to Europe and he was convinced the relationship wasn't over and he decided he was going to go to Europe to find her.

Speaker 2:          02:33:31       Right? So He's 18, right? Not a crazy guy, just really romantic guy. And it was not a scary breakup. So Anyway, nice story. They got back together. But um, what happened is, so he goes to, so it's just the, the only an 18 year old could get it into his head to do this. He gets on a plane and he doesn't even know which country she went to. So he just goes to Europe, right. He goes to Spain because he speaks Spanish and starts asking. He's like 10 days into his trip and so he's in Barcelona and some tourists, I hand him other tourists, hand him a camera and said, will you take our picture? And he picks up the camera and he's taking their picture in interframe walks his ex girlfriend. Right. So he's like within 10 days he just found her in. So what are the chances of that happening? Well, it's pretty fucked. Pretty is pretty small, right? Um, but that kind of, that stuff happens to people. It would be, it would be a miracle if high low probability events never happened. You know, it's like if, if it will be a miracle, if no one, no one in human history ever had a story like that to tell, you know, we're in a system where it's, it's balanced. There's bound to be very low probability events or

Speaker 3:          02:34:43       it's just not fully evolved. And this kid went on his instincts and he tapped into the information in the universe and he knew instinctively where to go and he met his sweetheart, God Damn Sandra Bullock movie.

Speaker 2:          02:34:53       If, if it's a, if it's an ability that anyone should care about, it should be testable. It should be strong enough

Speaker 3:          02:35:00       tested. But how can you test something when it's an unique event that very rarely takes place completely uncontrollable, and it's something that's just a, almost like a natural phenomenon that rarely occurs. I mean, how are you going to put something in a testing environment in the environment of a laboratory? Oh No. See if it really does make sense that you think about,

Speaker 2:          02:35:20       I think it might be Sheldrake who's doing this. Hey, there's a test of the, of the phone call phenomenon where you get, people can subscribe to get there. They get a call at the, they enlist like their five closest people in their lives and to call them at random intervals, you know, I guess they did it disable their caller id or whatever. And you can just set this up so that you know,

Speaker 3:          02:35:42       still not a true moment because they're, they're acting on a, an experiment. But then instead, do you know that someone calling you might not just be calling you because they tapped into this idea of loving you and they I this idea of missing you and that is the tune that breaks through all the way to you and causes you to look at your phone right when they turned in. That's not replicatable. Replicatable. Yeah. That's what goes for replicable. Replicable. Yes. It's not, I mean, you know what I'm saying? I mean it's, the idea of unique events isn't disproven by experimenting with it. Look, I've, I don't know that it's true that sometimes, you know, when someone is calling the, but I've, I've had the experience myself but I haven't had in years. It's been years and years since I knew who was going to call me. And I looked at it. But I do remember it having, having it happened in my life several times would if it's something that just, you know, want to fucking summer solstice, the planets are aligned, your own biology, you have a certain amount of water in your system and boom, the, there's a certain amount of love and the thought gets through. Is that possible?

Speaker 2:          02:36:41       Well, well sure it's possible. But the question is what even though, even if it's true, given this description doesn't really seem to matter because then they're all so, so it's, cause it's not fascinating would know, but it doesn't mean it doesn't count. It's like it's not, it's not a matter of just, it's not a sign of how connected you are with the person because sometimes you know, it's somebody you don't even like. Right. It's not a measure of how crucial it is that they reach you at that moment because sometimes it's completely trivial. And then other times when someone really had get ahold of you because you're, you know, dad was sick, they couldn't find you and you are just blissfully ignorant of the fact that the closest person in your life is having a medical emergency. Right. Well, no one's saying that it works all the time and that because it works on a blue moon that it can't, you know, but that, but then that's not working well, it's not that it's not working, it just doesn't work all the time.

Speaker 2:          02:37:34       It's a rare event. Is it? Is, are there, is it possible that there are rare events like that or do you think it's all just, well, no, but they're much more likely scientifically to be as much as well, given this, given what we're talking about now, this is all much more likely to be coincidence. I mean, it's just, it's just, it's, it's quite you. You don't have that many people in your life. You think about, you think about them. You don't have that many people in your life who call you. I mean, we just were actually run the numbers on this one problem. Is that we have very bad intuitions of probability. So if you heard of the the birthday party problem, no. So if I got a room, if it puts you in a room of just random strangers, right? How many would I have to have in the room for you to be confident that two people in the room had the same birthday?

Speaker 2:          02:38:22       She's so that you'd be willing to bet. I'll bet you they would have to be thousands for me. Okay. And that would just be gas. Okay. So that's, so that's basically everyone's guests. That is just, there's 365 days in the year. We've got to get two people on the same day. That's going to be a lot of people, right? The truth is, and this is just the fact that if you get 23 people in the room, you have crossed the 50% threshold so that it's more likely than not that two of them have the same birthday. That's amazing. 23 people. Now, the reason now what's crucial to understand is that it's, it's the crucial piece. And this actually goes to this deflate. So many conspiracy theories and other bad ideas is that it's absolutely crucial that we didn't specify which birthday, right? So it's any two birthdays, any single birthday, any two people, and any single birthday, 23.

Speaker 2:          02:39:21       And that makes it, that makes it, that changes the game entirely. But if I said, how many people do I need in a room to find one with my birthday, that changes it. Right? Um, but at any two people on any given birthday, it's, yeah, if you go with just your birthday, that's thousands though. I don't offhand know what that would be, but anyway, that's a so, so anyway, our intuitions, our intuitions are bad, uh, about probability. And so, um, and so when you look at like nine 11 truth stuff, it's so much about finding these little anomalies that strike people as intuitively highly unlikely and in desperate need of explanation. Whereas you can always look at, at, at any, anything you look at after the fact can be described as a miracle. So like I could say to you, what are the chances that all of the wires and objects on this desk would be exactly in this position on this doesn't amount of creationists argument for the, the evolution of the eyeball. Like how's it, yeah, so a bit, but at least, so there's actually more to talk about there. I mean, it is kind of inscrutable how this, this stuff happens through um, uh, genetic, uh,

Speaker 4:          02:40:43       uh,

Speaker 2:          02:40:45       mutation and, and environmental pressure. But we can tell that story, but that, but this is just a post hoc after the fact. I say this is just inexplicably that the wires are tangled and exactly this way. If you were going to kind of randomly do this again, you'd never get them in this position. Um, but of course it's completely meaningless. There's not it, the wires have to be some way. They just happened to be this way. And I'm putting a, a morale completely gratuitous burden on you to explain the fact that they're just this way. Right? And so in any situations, certainly any situation is complicated. As September 11th, you're going to see all these anomalies. So you see, you know, the fact that, how do you explain the fact that

Speaker 4:          02:41:28       mmm.

Speaker 2:          02:41:30       You know, on that day we, the navy was running a fighter jet test and the F and we had f six teens that were out over the ocean or whatever, whatever the thing is, you know, they only run that test, you know, two days a year and they were running at that day, right. You could, if it wasn't that anomaly, you'd find some other anomaly. You can always, if as long as you're picking after the fact, you can always find something weird that is in desperate need of explanation, have their bins to stay statistical. Have there been studies that have proven statistics on people knowing that people are watching them? I've heard there's been studies people say if you had Rupert Sheldrake on here, he would say yes, but you would say, no. I, I would, I'm not close enough to the research to have any sense to some degree.

Speaker 2:          02:42:19       Some substantiated though. Well, you just have to take people at their word. So, so like I've talked to Rupert, I don't think Rupert is, I don't think he's a conscious fraud. I think he's a smart guy. He's a very earnest guy. Is he lying about what he thinks he knows or has he self deceived or is he, has he been deceived by unscrupulous people or is there a Shim bias? Yeah, yeah, exactly. So it's just the, the, the problem is that it's so fringe and so many people want to believe it's true that it's easy to worry that it hasn't really been fully, um, you know, the bushes haven't been beaten hard enough to find all the errors and the biases and the frauds. But if there's a real phenomenon there, it should be testable and it shouldn't be vulnerable to the slightest quirk of Oh, that, that experiment or had a bad vibe or it was too skeptical and therefore killed the effect.

Speaker 2:          02:43:15       Um, it just, uh, especially when you're talking about people who actually wheel, if, if, if, is it possible that someone could be the experiment there? Could I have a bad vibe and beast too skeptical set up and they got him a negative energy. You could, you could set up an experiment where I'm, the experimenter was 5,000 miles away or had really good vibes. You could put the true believers in, you know, kind of the coach. You can put a completely friendly coach who was, you know, Sylvia Brown, you know, crazy, fraudulent psychic, Sylvia Brown. She could be there working her magic, you know, and, and just, just helping everybody. You could, you could, you could surround them with only true believers if you wanted to. You could, you could design the experiment in such a way. Uh, um, so you can make the vibes as nice as you want.

Speaker 2:          02:44:02       It's just that that's anyone who's, there's a, there's a fundamentally unscientific attitude you get from many, many people in this area of the human conversation, which is, science has reductionistic. It's, it's, uh, hypercritical. It's life destroying. It's, there's this whole area of truth that science and principal can't touch. And that's just not true. It's like if it, if it's a real phenomenon, science is the best way to touch it. There's certain things that it's hard to figure out how you would do the experiments. Harder to figure out how to get it in the lab and how to get it to where the person who's doing the experiments not being influenced by the fact you're, you're experimenting on them. Yes, exactly. So there are certain, so you know, the, the scientific research I've done is with functional magnetic resonance imaging where you have to put people in an MRI scanner and it's hugely limits what you can study because there's the peep people can't move.

Speaker 2:          02:45:00       You know, if you move you, you destroy the image. So you got to lie in a clattering machine, uh, motionless and do some cognitive task that you can do looking at computer goggles or, you know, looking at a mirror, um, and across your feet out into the room. It's a, it limits you. So, so, so a brain scanning experiment is hugely limited. You can't put somebody on their bike and have them, you know, ride off into the distance, uh, while scanning their brain. But though those things aside, you can, and here we're not talking about experiments with those kinds of limitations. You can, if people have an ability to know who's calling on the phone, uh, if there's even one guy on planet earth who knows who has this ability, it should be, we could easily design an experiment that would demonstrate that. And the people who claim they're there are people who really claimed these abilities. The claimant a repeatable basis. Yeah. Yeah. There are people who, well, there they're the sort of kind of shyster western new age psychics

Speaker 9:          02:46:10       who, uh,

Speaker 2:          02:46:12       I'm not sure, but I, I, I imagine they just never submit to being tested, um, for obvious reasons. And then there are there, then there's the kind of Buddhist Hindu, Yogi, contemplative world where people imagine that great meditators have developed these abilities. And even some of the meditators will, you know, wink wink suggests that they probably have these abilities but are just too humble to demonstrate them. But, and there's sort of a kind of religious taboo against demonstrating them or, or, or challenging them or are submitting them to test. But in, yeah, in the, in the, in the contemplative world among Buddhists and, and an Indian Yogis, there's actually a straightforward path to developing these skills. I mean there's, there's a recipe you could go into your, you know, you can go ask the Dalai Lama, how could I learn to read people's minds? He has an answer to that question.

Speaker 2:          02:47:11       I mean it's not like, well it's, it's just a matter of whether you're gifted or not. Now there's actually, this is like you can get, you can basically get a phd and reading people's minds in, among Buddhists and Hindus. So the people who've done that, why don't they get tested? It's not cause it, cause what they're claiming is not an ability to make a random number. Generator jumped slightly. If they've got 5,000 people sitting next to them also doing it, they, they, they claim just huge abilities are possible for meditators who have reached certain levels of concentration. I mean there are people who,

Speaker 9:          02:47:46       who

Speaker 2:          02:47:48       the stories are as crazy as anything you've heard about like remote viewing. That's probably the craziest shit of all time, right? Is that Beverly? It is proven. That's never been proven. Just vague enough. Well first of all there are, there are magicians like um, so the British magician Derren brown. I gotta pee again.

Speaker 1:          02:48:10       I forgot to drink in this gigantic. I'm so, I'm so well let's do non psychic that I forgot I had to pay as how in touch I am with with the physical reality. This has been a really fascinating conversation man. We could go on for hours and hours. How long was this again? Almost three hours. Oh really? Yeah. Yeah. Well yeah we're five minutes away from three ls. Hope we didn't kill our audience. People love this shit. Look, I think your, your, your, your devotion to the scientific method and exploring everything is very admirable. It's very interesting and unique and we've never had anybody on the show that breaks things down in that way before. It's really, really been really cool. Um, follow him on Twitter, Sam Harris Org, and check out all of his books from letter to a Christian nation was the first one that I ever read to a end of faith.

Speaker 1:          02:48:57       And what is the most recent one? The moral landscape and freewill is the most recent. And Freewill is the PDF. It's a downloadable small, no, that's a line was a short essay that that's why a book on the ethics of line is it Sam Harris. Dot. Org is at the best I used to go to for everything. Yup. We got to do this again man. We didn't even touch a real pleasure. We didn't talk about martial arts. Who got all up in Jihad and a little bit of drugs. It was great man. Awesome, awesome time. We do this over and over again. So Ladies and gentlemen, that's it. Follow him by stuff. Sam Harris is the fucking man and the show's over. Thanks everybody. See you soon. See you this week. We got a lot of people coming up. Who the fuck did we got? Brian? Uh, at the Ice House? Yeah, we got Joey Diaz podcasts on Friday. Felicia Mason Silva's coming back on Tuesday. I'm Aubrey. Marcus is coming back next week. We got, we got a lot of people too. We've got a lot of people. All right. We love you bitches. Thanks. Thanks for everything. Bye. Bye.

Speaker 5:          02:50:01       Okay.

Speaker 7:          02:50:13       Okay.
