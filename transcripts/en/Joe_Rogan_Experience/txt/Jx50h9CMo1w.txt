Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Male. Hey everybody, the Joe Rogan experience podcast is a guy is in need of a new way of saying that because it's fucking tired of it. Goddammit Patrick Turner, the coming distractions. Yeah. Here, here's some shit you should do with your money if you want to help the show. It doesn't really help us. I mean it sort of helps us. It helps the people who pay us. So it helps us indirectly. One thing we can promise you, when we, uh, have any sort of sponsorship on the show, it is 100% of product that I believe in. There's, there's no like, we'll never bullshit you. So anything that we have that sponsors a show, you can guarantee that what we are saying first of all is 100% of what we believe. And the, if we find out that it's incorrect in any way, shape or form, we will go back and correct it.

Speaker 1:          00:00:48       There's a, the last thing I want, that's a little, that's not subtle enough. The last thing I want is for anyone to get ripped off ever from anything that I'm associated with. So everything we sell you, whether it's the supplements from on it or Ting, uh, we believe in, what is Ting Ting is if you go to rogan.ting.com you will be able to get a better understanding of it. And you also save 50 bucks on your first ting device. They have a bunch of cool smartphones, including the Samsung Galaxy s three. I only saw amazing your day. Don't do it. Don't know. Tim, why don't you hook Brian Redman up of the phone? I think we need his technical advice because I just love me like the bigger pictures. Maybe like going on browser, big screen. I've been using this nexus seven thing here and it has the android operating system on it.

Speaker 1:          00:01:39       And so now I'm like, man, I wish I could use this as a phone. Yeah. Because I kind of want to see the Internet. Is it on the Internet? It's a Wifi only. So I use my iPhone five to teeth are at to, do they make any ones like that that are um, by the way, it's tethered. You're fuck, there is um, the, um, did they make them that small? That actually or is it the note is the only one that's smaller than that. It is a smaller, they don't make something that size. That's a phone though. No, I don't think so. But I think us cellular Wifi, I saw somebody use one of those notes on the other day. This girl, this little girl had this humongous phone. It was like, it looked like the old days when people had boombox is on your shoulders. But they're cool man.

Speaker 1:          00:02:23       I'm telling you, I get mad phone envy, technology envy. Whenever I see that screen. Um, they don't, sorry, Tim doesn't have that. But they have the galaxy s three. That's why I want to get it yesterday. And I walk into a huge too. That's like a medium, a medium ground between the note and the, some of the other Google smart phones. Um, but the, what's great about Ting is the way they've set up their business and the, the idea behind it is you can still run a good business and make money and not have to rip people off. Not have to get people involved in these crazy contracts where you can't get out of it unless you pay money. I think that's disgusting. I really do. I think it's a crazy, horrible situation where when you, when you order service, especially from some gigantic multibillion dollar companies, you know, when you're ordering service, when you don't want the service anymore, you should be able to say, I don't want your service anymore.

Speaker 1:          00:03:15       Thank you very much. And boom, it goes away. It shouldn't be you have to pay them money. But that's how it is with most major providers. And Ting doesn't have it set up like that thing. Also, I, I misspoke when I said that, um, you, um, that you're, you're, you're minutes go into the next month if you don't use them, it's actually better than that. They actually knocked you down on your bill and then they credit you the next month. So it's like they actually charge you less money. This is not even that they give you more minutes, you less so they take away like you have a credit. Say, if you have a plan and you, your, your plan is to use x amount of minutes for x amount of dollars per month. If you use less than that, they will actually bill you less. I see. They'll credit your next month.

Speaker 1:          00:04:02       Right? It's, I mean overpaid on us. It's a great company and they use sprint. So it's a major networks network backbone without the contracts and all the other craziness that goes along with, uh, using cells for cell phone service. It's really nuts. So we support Tang. They're a cool company. And if you go to rogan.ting.com you can save 50 bucks of one of their many Badass android devices. It's really, if you're into technology, it's fucking fascinating stuff. We're also brought to you by [inaudible] dot com that's, Oh, Anne and I tea makers of Alpha brain. What are you doing Bryan? You scan the shit out of me. I got to put too much Alpha brain and my system for your sound effects. What is Alpha brain? It's um, it's most certainly is no miracle. Okay. It's not if you're a really dumb person. I'm so sorry.

Speaker 1:          00:04:53       But there's nothing you can do. But what it can do for you is what really, essentially all nutrients can improve the way your body functions. It's what your body needs to run. And we live in a world where most of us don't eat enough of the proper food. We don't eat enough healthy green leafy vegetables. That's like one of the main ones. Um, all sorts of different vegetables. We don't drink enough water. We, you know, we, we took a lot of stupid shit into our bodies. So the fix that first before you start taking any supplements before you just, you know, eat fucking two cheeseburgers and then go take some shroom tech and want to work out. It's not like that you should take care of your body first. That's number one. Eat as much healthy food as possible. Give yourself some cheat days, man.

Speaker 1:          00:05:37       Give yourself some days where you fuck off. But for the most part, try to eat healthy. You will feel better for sure. And more importantly, your mind will function better. There's essential nutrients that your mind needs to function at its optimal level. And what we've done with Alpha brain is isolate those nutrients and give them to you in the purest, most effective form possible there is behind it. However, I am way too stupid to be describing that science because I really have no education in any of these subjects and it's really nonsense and Jibberish that I've just memorize for people far more intelligent than myself. If you go to [inaudible] dot com it'll all be explained to you. There is Alpha brain, which is the one that, uh, I, I talk about so much. It's the one that I take before every comedy show. I take it before podcasts.

Speaker 1:          00:06:20       It's, um, it's, it's most certainly has a positive effect on the mental function. And I have so many of my friends addicted to it. It's a some fascinating shit. But if it doesn't work for you, you get 100% of your money back. Our first order of 30 pills and you don't even have to return the product. Just say this didn't work for me, and then you get your money back. Nobody wants you to be ripped off. And if you use a code name Brogan, you will save 10% off any and all orders of all supplements that are available through on it, including hemp force protein, the hemp based protein, which is legal and won't, you won't test positive for marijuana. Don't sweat it. It's not what it is. It's really, it's a weird little loophole where it's like, it's very similar to the marijuana plant, but it does, it's not psychoactive so you can eat it and it's really healthy for you.

Speaker 1:          00:07:04       Um, hemp protein is really healthy. It's what they use for fiber, for clothes, like camp clothes. But it's illegal to grow in America, but you can buy it. But you got to buy it with cash from Canada. It's fucking squirrely set up folks. So we get hemp prone, uh, protein, the finest hemp hearts from Canada. It's really hard to do it. It's annoying because it takes jobs away from US farmers, if I'm on it, could, we would love to have a farm here in America and grow hemp and hire people and employ them. But we can't. We can't because we have a corrupt government. Ladies and gentlemen, it's just, it's just been around for so long in this stupid wonky, transparent bullshit form that we, for whatever reason, are stuck there and unless less people talk about it, it's going to stay that way. And this is the problem folks.

Speaker 1:          00:07:49       It's nonsense that Hamsa legal, it's nonsense. It's not even related to the marijuana as a psychoactive drug debate, which is also nonsense grown people telling you what the fuck to do. But because of that nonsense, you can't buy hemp very cheap. It's expensive stuff. Use a code name broken, save 10% we also have kettle bells. We have a battle ropes, all different things to get you fit in a functional way. Uh, and by the way, all this stuff is stuff that I use myself. All of it is stuff that I've learned from strength and conditioning coaches from a guys that train people for Jujitsu or MMA. It's all like the best exercises to a really sort of for functional form, for functional strength, for strength, where your whole body moves as one unit. You know, these kettlebell exercises, it's a, you're not this, you're not isolating any muscle groups really.

Speaker 1:          00:08:39       It's like you're using your entire body and when you do that, it's like, first of all, you feel great. It's great to have like a body that works well. It's great to be able to move things. It's, I mean, just forget the superficial way that you would look. Just, it's great. It's nice to have a functional body that looking, pick things up if you need the moved. You know what I mean? People don't think about it that way. Where you essentially, your body is like a race car. You could choose how much horsepower to put in it. Oh, I have to do is lift weights. If you lift weights, you get more horsepower. It's that simple. Brian, Dj Brian on the mix. Anyway. Um, we also have BLENDTEC blenders coming in. They should either be in today or tomorrow. I think they're in already. They're fucking fantastic. There's the blenders that we saw we use on an iPhone. We just decided to start selling them like they're the best blenders. Yes, they're awesome. They they, yeah. Though I use a Vitamix, which is equally good. Excellent, excellent blender. But, uh, most of the consensus was that blend texts.

Speaker 2:          00:09:34       I wonder if you could blend a Vitamix with this, break it up first, but I bet you could just try one that pointed the blades, couldn't blend the blades. Right. I don't know what the fuck would happen. Should it be chaos,

Speaker 1:          00:09:50       uh, on a.com folks and also, uh, Jesus Christ, uh, audible was the last one. I love audible. audible.com if a, let me pull up the euro URL real quick.

Speaker 2:          00:10:01       Lot of people are saying thank you for introducing them to the Steve Martin Book, uh, born standing up. Uh, uh, they loved it. Yeah. Because Steve Martin reads it and so it's like listening to like a play on that. It's great. I highly recommend it. I like audible for like road trips. I'll put it on my iPhone and just like Bluetooth it over and listened to us. People talk and fall asleep while I'm driving. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:10:27       I'm a huge fan of books on tape. Uh, when I used to use them, a lot of road gigs, whenever to have these long road gigs, it'd be painful. I going to drive like three hours up to Maine or something like that. Back then they were all cassettes, but I, I got into it and it's like, man, it changes a boring drive and does something wrong.

Speaker 2:          00:10:47       Really exciting. Okay. All right. That was a mistake. These are ridiculous. You look a little try. This is the way it was supposed to sound like, that's like a little car that's better. That's way better.

Speaker 1:          00:11:02       Um, they're all w, but it was trying to say is that when you're on a long boring ass drive or any kind of commute, plane flight, whatever, it can literally turn something that's seemingly meaningless into an educational experience and inspirational experience. I mean, that's the beauty of books on tape or could just be like really educational, you know? Um, I mean, it's, uh, to me it's a, it's an awesome resource that a lot of people don't take. Pardon. And, uh, it allows you to make productive time and enjoyable time out of time. That sucks. That fucking dumb ass commute you have to do every day. You know, when you, when you listen to an excellent book on tape, man, it's a, it really is. Um, to me it's, it's a total game changer. It makes it enjoyable. You actually get home, you're like, how you feel? Great. It just so fired up. You know, I've sometimes gone home and, uh, you know, taking the CD out and listen to a book on tape in my house, you know, and you could do that if you have an iPhone hook up to your car too. I just, I'll just continue it. I get got rope 10. Um, if you go to Joe Rogan, Duh,

Speaker 2:          00:12:07       it's the wrong fucking URL. audible.com backslash, uh, something

Speaker 1:          00:12:16       that didn't help at all.

Speaker 3:          00:12:17       Bull backs. I think it's Joe Rogan. Let's see. It's that, or it's, Joe was trying to leave it hit a bump. They say so it's not that. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:12:32       I'm trying to look up Alison Shudi. Yeah. Okay. It's Joe. That's what it is.

Speaker 1:          00:12:35       It's audible.com. Forward slash. Joe, if you do it, you, uh, if you go there, you can try audible free for 30 days and get a free audio book. So it's an awesome resource. Audible is one of the best sites in the world when it comes to this. It's like the, the most prominent site in the world when it comes and they've been around for a long time

Speaker 2:          00:12:56       and the onset of Opiod, Anthony shows when you were on there, they have like back episodes of when you ran or an opiate Anthony. So like, like you can listen to it. Ari should fear and us and everyone on, on, on the opn yet they'd, they also have a your cd's on here and shit like that. So it's a good way to buy your stuff. Yeah, it's just, it's a cool service. It's a cool service that we would like to set up. Uh, I really enjoy the audio books and, and you know, of course shows like opie and Anthony, great to be able to get to and comedy cds and stuff like that. It's just a huge variety of things. But the, the

Speaker 1:          00:13:27       beautiful thing is if you go to audible.com four slash Joe, you could try it out free for 30 days

Speaker 3:          00:13:33       and get a free audio book, right? Is that what it is? Yeah. Something along those lines. Uh, yes. That is exactly what it is. All Right Ladies and gentlemen, let's fucking get this show rolling. This is the lamest commercials we've ever done. We need a little fire under our asses,

Speaker 1:          00:13:50       ladies and gentlemen. The Great Alex Gray is here. We're going to get the bottom of some shit and figure some things out.

Speaker 2:          00:13:59       Good

Speaker 1:          00:13:59       experience, Joe Rogan podcast all day. If there is a man that is on more

Speaker 1:          00:14:11       dorm room walls than you, it might be frank Frazetta but it's only like if you count all time, you know, if you think about it like if as far as like the 70s and eighties those poster years, Frank Frazetta put in some God damn numbers. You know, that guy that he had some amazing stuff, but you sir are right up there and you are as far as like the psychedelic community goes, you're the only guy that I've ever seen that I've looked at your work. And I'm like, wow, that guy actually like captured some of that. You, you, you've actually grabbed some of it and you've, uh, it's, it's v for someone who has

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       an experienced, uh, a really intense psychedelic breakthrough sort of a moment. They, they, I don't know if they would connect with your art work the same way. It's beautiful. It's striking. It's amazing and unique. But it's, what's amazing to me about it is that when I see your stuff, it's like you've really captured something somehow or another, the, the, the unremembered bubble. You remembered it enough or you channeled it enough or whatever, but you nail stuff, man. Mean you're, that, that one that you were just showing the Hologram. Oh yeah. What is, what is the cause one of my faves? Yeah, it's one of my favorites.

Speaker 4:          00:15:33       The, uh, the, the Bardo being, and then the, uh, diamond being at, let's say they angles here. Yeah. There's a diamond being, there's a bar that there's the, uh, jewel being so see how they kind of like, uh, they, uh, it's like you have a little trans dimensional portal and in a postcard. Wow. That's amazing. That's beautiful. That one right there, that one that, that's yeah, that's totally damped. Yeah. You nailed body who has had the trip to me and experience, uh, recognizes it. And that's what's really fascinating because it's impossible to actually translate that trans dimensional realm that enter dimensional, uh, uh, infinitude. And yet as crude as it is a painting that's an authentic, uh, transmission from that stain will communicate to people. And it astonishes me that, uh, I meet brothers and sisters all over the world that say the same thing, that they've been there, they've seen that, they know where I'm painting from.

Speaker 3:          00:16:47       Have you ever had a thought in your mind or a dream where somehow no, other than the dream, this has happened to me several times in my life where an image, a really weird, bizarre, random image was recognized to me to mean something or have some significant, uh, play some significant part of my life, whether it's some friends, I know a place that I live, but it would be imagery. It was really weird. It like I looked at that imagery, whatever it was, it's strange geometric pattern and it represented to me very clearly like this aspect of my life, but only in a dream form. It's visual poetry and I re, I remember so many times it's going, I got to wake up and I got to write this down, but I couldn't even write it down because the shape was constantly moving in my mind. Yeah. You know, it had like, I was like, no, but if I could just draw this image with bill, that's what you did, exactly what you drew that. Yeah. It's kind of a compression of, of that. That's for you. Of course. Thank you. Yeah, you nailed man. Whatever it is

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       right there. Boom. The one with the stripes, Holy Shit. The skulls and the stripes. That's insane, man. That's like, that's as close to what a real trip feels like as, as possible. And that's for anybody who has ever had any sort of psychedelic experience. That's the crazy thing about it at all. After all rather is that it is possible. It's hard to believe that it's possible. Wouldn't you know,

Speaker 4:          00:18:12       I wanted to, um, give to you, uh, the fourth book in America. Uh, you're, you will be the fourth now. This is, you'll be the fourth person to have seen, uh, this book, which we just got an hour ago. My wife and daughter and I saw it. It was delivered to her door and we, and we drove right over here. Wow. So this is t you a brand new, it won't be out in the United States for another month and a half or something like that. Wow. It is a net of being.

Speaker 1:          00:18:53       Wow. This is awesome. Thank you very much. That's cool.

Speaker 5:          00:18:57       Wow.

Speaker 1:          00:19:00       This is incredible. I can't wait to go through it. I'm going to set it down, but I've been a fan of your work for years, man. I've got a big a piece of yours. Um, hanging up in my isolation tank room, I have several of them. I have a disco ball and that isolation tank, no, I think that's what it needs and really take it over the edge. Um, the, um, uh, the cosmic Christ, it's another one of my favorites. It's when did you start doing this kind of art? I, how long have you been doing this?

Speaker 4:          00:19:31       Oh, let's see.

Speaker 4:          00:19:34       When I was at 21, I had a kind of a crisis I think. And I wasn't sure that I really wanted to live any longer because I was really, uh, um, I was really depressed. And so, and of course I did not believe there was a spiritual reality at all. And even though my, my friends had a, had a trip before me, I never did because I was so miserable. I just thought I'd go to hell and who needs infinite hell? And so anyway, at some point, uh, I prayed to a god that I didn't really believe existed. And, uh, uh, that if you do exist, then I, uh, I need a sign or, you know, I'm through and, and so within 24 hours, I, I'm saying goodbye to my professor, uh, at art school. And it was the last day of school, like August 30th or something or, or, uh, didn't, no, no, no. It was like May 30th, May 30th. And, and around the corner drives us a VW at, and it's Sa, the Scow, Alison who, uh, uh, invites us to her graduate now it's kind of like the end of school party and her sister's in town. And so, uh, so this professor picks me up later that night and we go to this party. And on the way he says, I've got in this bottle, some Kahlua and LSD.

Speaker 4:          00:21:22       And I said, you know what? Basically, what the fuck? And so I drank about half of it and, uh, I got to the door and the gout drinks the other half. And I sit on her couch for the entire journey almost. And, uh, just sit there kind of weirdly inside myself on one of her sculptures, a couch with a, with a soft figurine of a self portrait. And so, um, when I closed my eyes inside, and I've never had a trip like this sense, but I was in the dark, I could see I was in the dark, but I was going toward the light because there was this curling kind of mother of Pearl, like conch shell thing. And I was like a tunnel with a light coming just from around the side. And, uh, and it was awesome because it was, that was it. Of course, this was God.

Speaker 4:          00:22:25       This was the light was God. And I knew that even if I was in the dark, I was going toward the light. And I saw that all the shades of gray connect, both those opposites. And so I changed my name to gray right then. And so my art has always been kind of trying to integrate the spectrum of reality into a more holistic picture of, uh, the trans dimensional, the visionary and the Trans transcendental because the transcendental aren't traditions, you know, the, all the sacred arts of all the different world, visionary cultures. Cause all, all religion comes from the mystical experience. And that's a visionary experience. And you see it through all the, uh, the mosques are beautifully worn, a mentally patterned from the same visionary mindscape that a Dmt user would recognize. And the same thing goes for the great Christian masterpieces and all through a world religion, there are these waves that have crystallized into these visionary experiences of angels, of demons, of all kinds of worlds. And they're really, uh, uh, it's, it's the thing that connects all the world religions is sacred art, you know? And so we started thinking like, wow, there's needs to be a new kind of sacred art that integrates this visionary dimension of where all, all cultures, uh, emanate from this vision at the true visionary cultures. Aminay from us. You, she see it in the Shapebos, you see it in, uh, the, uh, the we chose way. You see it in so many of face, uh, patterns.

Speaker 3:          00:24:21       Isn't it a fascinating thing that art is such an integral part of religion, but it's not really discussed that way. Religion is all about ideology for most people. But if you really stop and think about it, the, the Christian artwork, the Hindu artwork, why do we care about, we listened to the music or watch the dance. You know, it's, it's the way that people connect together. It's a fascinating aspect though, a really underappreciated aspect. The aspect of religious art having influence. Cause especially when you're stopping and you're thinking about back when people had no other transmissions, there was no broadcast images. There's no video, there was no photographs. You literally had nothing or incredibly stunning religious heart. You know, that's it. You know, there was nowhere else to go to see iconography and was probably the most impactful thing a person could see back then.

Speaker 3:          00:25:15       Cause there'd be all this other art. But the other art, you know, whether it's a painting of a tree or whatever the fuck it is, it's, it's not going to be Jesus, you know, and someone who can paint an incredibly detailed Jesus. And if you stop and think about the time in which these people were doing this, you know, this is a, an incredibly, like the, like the access to information was almost nil. So this to them must have been hugely impactful. The actual, because you could see it and it wasn't just a thought, it wasn't just you talking about, you can actually see this painting. There are benchmarks in the evolution of human consciousness as what they are so strange that it's not really talked about as being completely connected because it's the underground mycelium of visionary culture that unite everyone. And that's what the religion of the 21st century is, I think is just your creativity, you know, and it's your way that you connect with God however it is. And it's, uh, it comes out. You can look at the art, you can see how the arts could unite all world religions. It's trans dimensional, you know, or Trans Trans Denominational and tries to match now, you know, and that's what we're building at Kozum. Even, uh, Scientology has lava exploding out of a mountain and across with like

Speaker 4:          00:26:44       a crazy star thing in the middle of it. Yeah. You know, they have their own shit to deal Mormons. The Mormons have religious artwork. Oh Wow. They have temples and they're quite extraordinary. So thank you. And the, and the stories themselves are works of art. No, they are all religious. Yes. All the stories of all the founders and mystics come from this visionary experience. They have. I think Joseph Smith though, it's been pretty much proven that it was a con man. Well, he claimed to have a mystical experience. That's what ignited the excitement, the religious fervor of people. He was also monitored, you know, and there are a lot of people who hated him. Obviously. He wished martyred at like the Bob Gotten martyred, the behind the Great Behi. Now there's, I'm not familiar with that story. Oh my God. You know, it's not the church of the sub genius Bob.

Speaker 4:          00:27:40       It's the, uh, it's the, uh, founder of the Behi religion. And where's that from? Uh, unfortunately I ran and I believe, and, uh, they, so he was, uh, considered a heretic and it was the, I believe later 19th century when he received the, uh, understanding that there is a unity of all world religions that we should consort with people of all religions. And that, uh, that religion comes in waves of revelation and he argued for the equality of, uh, uh, women and men and the, uh, the friendship of all races. And so this, uh, the understanding of how, uh, some of the religions had failed us, but not pointing out negatives, but just positing, uh, what could be as a higher vision of a world religion. It's fascinating to me that even religions that are clearly made up, like we're someone that sat out to try to create a religion, you can call it a cult or what have you, but there's ones that they've done that where even though you know that someone invented it, it's still has a positive impact on those people.

Speaker 4:          00:28:59       Yeah. So it's almost like even creating a fake religion if done the right way, imparts an important, there's a problem of, I think there's a problem with that is really, yeah. Yeah. Well I definitely, yeah, stuff based on false hoods are not really religion. To me. The, the, uh, the, the real religion, uh, has to do with contact, direct contact with God and that's, that's then it comes out through these stories and, uh, the validity of any of the world religions is through the direct contact. But I know people that are Mormons that have benefited tremendously from being Mormon. I mean, I know some really

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       nice, friendly people and a lot of that is attributed to their faith, which brings them to these churches and these communities. But that, you know, that thing was created by a 14 year old boy who said he found golden tablets that were the last work of Jesus. That is something that was created by [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          00:29:58       bullshit. While it seems to be helping those people, it might've been a dream. Just like when you see picture images that are spelling out something to you, um, to him as a, as, or a liar or a visionary was, uh, you know, given this owl chemical symbol, it United the symbolism of Alchemy, of Christianity and of native Americans. Now this is a unique synthesis. This is what Joseph Smith did. Yeah. Joseph, well, I con of graphically, right? The Chameleon, the tablets that you could go back to Hermes, Trismus justice, the emerald tablet, or you could look at the, uh, the tablets of the, um, did Jewish, you know, Moses tablets you could look at. So there's a, uh, the Rosetta stone, all of these written in stone is, it's a very powerful symbol. Okay. So, uh, and the, the chameleon that, uh, doesn't, um, uh, burn, you know, it's the, it's an alchemical symbol. So

Speaker 1:          00:31:09       to us, the, the iconography, the icon of a written and tablet is almost like all sort of like profound ideas will come in that form or many will come in that form because it represents like almost in our DNA a represents something of significance.

Speaker 4:          00:31:26       Wow. Those, um, those aligned with this vision, this higher vision, granted an American, this was like one of the earliest, um, religions along with spiritualism, born in America. Now there's a differentiation because you have your Middle Eastern, which is mostly everything comes out of there and you go a little, uh, uh, to the side and to India. And, uh, uh, this, this is it. It didn't happen over here to our knowledge. Of course, the native people were wise beyond anyone, but no one was listening to them. No one took them seriously because they were all heathens. And so they were murdered. We move, we move to an awesome, awesome place upstate Hudson valley, the town of Wappinger and the WAPA venture people 400 years ago, people, the east side of the river, all the way down to Manhattan or you know, loosely federated tribes. And you knew that, that cause you're from Jersey.

Speaker 4:          00:32:35       The, uh, the Hudson River used to be called the [inaudible]. Connie took before Henry Hudson. Whoa. The mall he, Connie took, that's way cooler. Ah, listen to what it means. Listen to what it means, that, uh, the great flow that goes both ways. Ooh, because it's a tie. It's a tidal river. It's a moon river. It is polled back and forth all the way up to whoppin chair. Why would they want to change that name? So beautiful? Because Henry Hudson put his big Dick, uh, in history. Henry Hudson changes himself. Well, he got a chance. Well, he did establish the white, uh, folk in there. And there were a few friendly exchanges between Hudson and the wappinger. Some of the very first encounters with native people where the Wappinger with the, uh, with Hudson and he reports on it. And there was a, there was an unfortunate incident where, uh, his men had killed, uh, some, uh, you know, just in fear.

Speaker 4:          00:33:43       And, uh, they kind of were forgiving for one night and I think they all got drunk. And then, uh, then like a war ensued over a hundred years, the entire tribe was like wiped out. Oh my God. And it was the genocide of a people practically at Nais fragmented, uh, this, uh, beautiful people. It was over a hundred years. Oh man, it was relentless. And uh, and so the last time were driven out, uh, like the Cyo to trail the trail of tree of tears. And I heard like clay at here, this native American brother came to us after we acquired this land and want banter because he felt it was always wholly to the WAPA. Pinchers and uh, so, you know, we put a big, uh, Karen to honor the wappinger spirit. And um, he, he talked about what happened to the wop wappinger and how they were walked out like through Ohio.

Speaker 4:          00:34:49       They had to march, you know, and uh, as they were going through Ohio, they passed right down high street from where I was born. You're a burden on high street. That's where I'm from. No, no, in Columbus, Ohio where I'm from. Yeah. And so I put a self portrait, like as one of my crazy ass art projects, you know, really early on I used to work for a billboard, the billboard place, and I said, please let me do this. It's a dead bored anyway, you know, nobody cares. You know, it's on high street. And it was a, a self portrait, but with half my hair shaved. And uh, so, but it was a huge, um, billboard kind of thing. But with his head with very ambiguous like what is that? And, uh, so high street

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       was the trail of tears. And at that point, Evan said that number of the Delaware Indians began to absorb the brothers and sisters of the Wappingers so that they found a solace there. And there was something very interesting about the Delaware Indians was that they had a particular kind of haircut, uh, that was only for the warriors in order to keep their, uh, their bow out of the hair. It was a cut in half side, uh, you know, was shaved bald and the other half was long. Here's the, a, a billboard actually. Yeah, that's, I'm from a Worthington. Holy Crap. Hey neighbor, how you do it? Well, people are from Columbus. It's funny. Yeah. We've run into so many people from Ohio, Maynard's from Ohio I guess too. Yeah, that's a, that's wild man. So you didn't even know that when you did it. Hell No.

Speaker 3:          00:36:33       I had to move to wappinger to find that out. That's crazy. Wow. What a what a sad, sad story. And you know, we uh, we spend so little time thinking about the culture of the people that lived here before us. It's so fascinating that we to on foot, we want to honor them and um, you know, just say what, what remarkable and a wonderful people that they were. Could you imagine mean if you have, I mean I'm sure you have a match because you live in this property. If you thought about what it must have been like to live there as them before the white man arrived, it must have been amazing there. It must've been like avatar except no flying dragons notail sex about a lot of it was like, I mean they were literally living off the land and they knew how to do it and they were sustainable and they had great reverence for the land.

Speaker 3:          00:37:29       They lived off. You mean the, they were missing a lot of inventions that western Manhattan. But man, I bet. I bet they were pretty fucking happy. For the most part. There's a, I was in Disneyland yesterday, man. It's a dis. There is a disturbing trend of people getting so fat that they have to be wheeled around. Did you see South Park last week? Did the whole thing about that? You will go crazy, dude, I will go crazy because it was weird. It was weird. It was. It wasn't. There were injuries. You weren't injured people. They were just, or if they were fucking injured, it was from being fat. These people were enormous and they were pushing them around these other, there was a these little scooter things taking them everywhere. I guess the, the morbidly obese have not had a proper vehicle in the past. Perhaps it's a tab out vehicle they give up. They just give up on life like fog. I'm just going to scoot around. There's so many of them, man. I mean it wasn't, it was, I don't remember seeing this when I was younger. I don't remember seeing these numbers of morbidly obese people on motor scooters where they literally have stopped walking like that. That's

Speaker 4:          00:38:36       too painful or they're too big to walk. What, what has numbed people to the point where, uh, that is an acceptable behavior? Is it the kind of crap that fast food has, uh, uh, gone to or, uh, you know, as part of it? What do you think?

Speaker 1:          00:38:56       Uh, there's, there's certainly an issue with the human body becoming addicted to unhealthy foods. The look, me, myself, I struggle with cheeseburgers and fries. I love them. They're so delicious, but I know it's like, it's super unhealthy, but I try to limit it and then I put a really healthy food in between that. Some people don't do that. They don't, and if you don't, you can get caught up in this addiction cycle was shit food.

Speaker 4:          00:39:21       Yeah. I mean if you're, if you know everybody who does that artery read that, uh, old report, you know, the change didn't. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:39:29       Yeah. Um, that's, that's a certainly a good thing to read. But I mean, it's, it's just, it's, it is weird. The numb numbness is a good way to describe it because it's just, you just keep eating and you don't see it. You know, you don't freak out. You know, it's like somehow slowly but surely, he just get to this insane point and

Speaker 4:          00:39:47       well, I mean, I love Walt Disney. He said to me is an extraordinary artist. And, and look at the, uh, amazing industry that's grown up around and then the breakthroughs and, and a motion picture technology, all kinds of things that nature films, you know, they, they used to really, uh, deeply, uh, and, uh, ubi works. Uh, they finally are acknowledging his, uh, you know, authorship basically it Mickey mouse and things like that. So it's, I think that they're an awesome organization that has tried to, uh, growing in a, in a beautiful way and is a way, a kind of the most generous a representation of the Cherry on top of, uh, American culture or something. At the same time, you know, you like, you really wonder like, well, well, what does it actually mean? What is, what is the religion of Disney as him teaching us? Is it something about, um, uh, passive observation of reality, uh, and uh, to, uh, kind of delight us with spectacles of our, uh, sort of delusional understanding of certain things? Or is it actually playing a, an important kind of moral, um, role? And I think that for the most part, you know, it's been a very benign to very positive, uh, organization I think. And as a, and as art, it's unparalleled. You know,

Speaker 1:          00:41:19       they do have some amazing cartoons. Stop and think about it like a, the sorcerer, what was the, uh, the first one called Asia antisocial. My premise, amazing, amazing piece of work. And if you really stop and think about the time

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       in which that was released, I mean, there was nothing like it before. It was so groundbreaking. It's hard for people to really understand. Was This 1930s? Is that what that was? Yeah, the look, the rides are amazing. My kids have an awesome time. I love Disneyland. That's not what I, I've just, I'm freaking out about humans. The first of all, the fact that Disneyland is so packed, it's crazy. So many human beings in one area. It's incredible. But, but you know what it's like, it's like Faca for Americans. I mean, is there anything else more Mac out like in American wall of American? Maybe but not really know Disneyland is the spot. Maybe a Disney world and Disneyland. Yeah, those two. Yeah, maybe sea world, but not even. No, no. Disney land. It's like really where it's at. Yeah. It's incredible how, and you know it was really kind of cool about it was there's so many people there.

Speaker 3:          00:42:28       I mean it is insane. I never saw one person raise their voice. I didn't see one person get angry with their kids. I didn't see, I mean for as much as we like to talk about the negative aspects of humans and man lately on this podcast, it's really been a bummer. We've been having a lot of people like, like reporters telling us about corruption and the Congress people running for Congress that are telling us about how fucked up these new bills that are being passed. I mean you just over and over again you keep hearing negative shit and we're guilty of it too. We were discussing it, but when you go to Disneyland you like all these people get along great. Like look what's going on here. They personally own positive vision. Us a positive ability for all of us and have always emphasized creativity as a and the imagination as something that is really important.

Speaker 3:          00:43:21       It's uh, it's amazing that they can get that many people to be friendly. You never hear about a gang fight breaking out at Disneyland. No. That's what kind of makes me mad though with all those protestors though, an Anaheim who are trying to march to march towards that. I kind of don't like that. I kind of like, there's a lot of kids there, you know? Why don't you just get away from that? Yeah. I think they were trying to do that, I think is that we get the maximum amount of attention. Fuck with that. You know, like if my kids there and you start doing bringing that to my kids, fuck you. You know? Okay. You shouldn't say fuck you because all they're trying to do was called light to the fact that the kid was murdered by a cob. Yeah. But you know what I mean?

Speaker 3:          00:44:00       Like don't bring it to her to that. Why would you bring protests where people are dressed up in military towards kids? Well, I don't think when they first started doing it, there was no one dressed up in military. That's how that happened when they arrived. So I think there's a little bit of confusion there on your part there, buddy now. But I think just people would just choose Anaheim, but some things are that are pouring then rides, man. Some things are more important than rods and getting people to pay attention. Kids are more important than everything. All tech kits or hey listen to this. Don't think this is hurting the kids. I think there's only reason the only violence was being thrown at the protestors. The protestors, as far as I know, didn't or weren't accused of doing anything violent. It was the police that were showing up with, unfortunately if that shooting rubber bullets like we saw with Amber Lyon when she was on the podcast, they shot rubber bullets.

Speaker 3:          00:44:52       I it. But unfortunately you know how there's going to be people, especially like homeless people that are joining these kinds of protests. Just to be like fuck the police. Cause I've, I saw it at, okay Brian, what's a ship? The thing where everyone sat outside by Wall Street and occupy La. When I went there I was like, there's like a bunch of drunks, a little different like this and this was a community. This particular instance in Anaheim was a community responding to a murder. It was violent. You know, they brought, there was violence in Anaheim. It could, there shouldn't be violence anywhere in your kids. That's what I'm saying. Oh, can I see what you're saying? But I think in this case, if somebody's trying to do violence, they weren't violent. The cops were violent towards them. That's the accusation. Right? As far as I understand it, you know the, what we saw with that.

Speaker 3:          00:45:36       Amber, why just protests? I don't know why he did eat it. You thought about yourself innocent boy. Why? Because I was thinking about how awesome Disneyland wise, and I was like that when it was on the last episode. I remember thinking that. It is amazing. But what I found fascinating about when, one of the things that made me smile when I was there, it was, it really is amazing how well people can get along if sort of, gee, if the right kind of vibes are generated and Disneyland, it's like the exact right kind of vibe. The only thing that sucks is lines and lines. Everybody just kind of laughs and jokes around and kids play with each other. That's not that big a deal. Hey Man, that outlines very well. Some kids complain and they say, look, we're going to have a great time when we get on the Rod. It's going to be fine. It's, it's amazing how well people can get along in that sort of environment. People can say, well that's unrealistic. Well, no, it's not unrealistic. It's like we all cried

Speaker 6:          00:46:29       to get along, you know, instead of think that, you know, stepping outside of a place like that, which I, you know, say it one way or the other seems a little more sacred to people. Uh, and that may seem humorous in some ways, but it's uh, because it's focused positive. Yeah. Uh, it's family oriented, it a nondenominational and can be enjoyed. And uh, you know, by, by anyone.

Speaker 3:          00:47:00       Yeah. It's a positive place. It's fun. It's a fun place. But, and it is, is sacred in that respect. It's for, for children. It's such an a, it's like a little religious experience almost. Yeah. It's fun. I mean, it's like, you see, it seems so much fun. See fairies

Speaker 6:          00:47:15       in places you see, you get a taste of the visionary experience. That's what they're trying to create. It's a fully dynamic, uh, pull you into a new way of seeing reality kind of reorienting

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       experience. Yes. It's, you know, it's like, oh, well we just want the temples to be like this because they're so exciting and they're so fun and they're, some are a little too threatening, but summer, you know, sit depending on the age, you know, and so you learn and you can grow and you can go and visit these things and enjoy them with your children. It's a wonderful thing. We need, the pool is very psychedelic. Have you been on the Winnie the Pooh ride? Oh my goodness. Winnie the Pooh is, first of all, it's fascinating because my daughter, she's only four and the Winnie the Pooh was like, have you get buckled down in this thing and it's a slow ass ride. So when w when it's over, she looks, when she goes, why do we have seatbelts on? She was like, this is ridiculous. Like a four year old is like you don't need seat belts for this.

Speaker 3:          00:48:13       This is so stupid. Like why did they make us it down? Um, but you, you go through it and it's all Winnie tripping. Okay. Cause they do, they do it in the guise of him falling asleep. So when he is sitting there and then when he ghost is doing flips like over him and flips over him, then we enter into this next room, which is supposed to represent Winnie's dreams. And it saw neon tiggers knocked him over and honeys everywhere and he's like, this dreams amazing. And he's literally in heaven. I mean he's in this wonderful psychedelic heaven where this like tiger, who's neon colored completely like, yeah, whole thing is white, you know,

Speaker 7:          00:48:54       lights. It happened in Dumbo and it happened. Look, when you, when you go through it, when Winnie the Pooh has his, has his psychedelic trip, like right when he goes through and he falls asleep. It's so obvious that like acid based. Yeah. Yeah. As mushrooms or something there he starts tripping. That's cool. And then when he comes out of this dream, you know, when he comes out of this, uh, this, this falling asleep experience, you see the next crazy room. We look at this. We need the pull is tripping his brains off. This is a DMT trip. Look at this. Look at pink Tigger neon paint. Take a look at this. About the fucker with giant orange, orange heads and green arms and honeys floating everywhere. What is more psychedelic than this? Look at this. What the fuck are they trying to say? This happens when you sleep. It was just how many, when you look at this, if there's anything that's a psychedelic trip, it is Goddamn Winnie the Pooh. That should be the next thing. Kids taking mushrooms and getting on the way. The pool ride. I bet you would freak the fuck out. Just a pot cooking on this thing.

Speaker 7:          00:50:07       It's amazing. That's great. Isn't that amazing? Wow. That is clearly a psychedelic now. So this is a walkthrough. No, no, no, you're strapped in to, my daughter was trying to express, wow. I tried to stretch a little bit like a intestines or something. Like you're being in his imagination. Yes. Yeah. And then the pimps you out at the end. Yeah. Normal. Yeah. Yeah. No of the human animal fusion is an archetype that's tens of thousands of years. What do you, uh, what do you think that is? What's the human animal? Anthropomorphic being there. They were standing up. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:50:51       Like human beings kind of, and like your association with them was person to person in a way, but they, they represent the character of that creature, you know, in a more humanoid, anthropomorphic talking kind of way. So that spirit in a sense can speak to you. Like you could be in contact with other animal spirits, but they would communicate to you and in a certain language that you could understand. And so always, I think the Schamens had been able to have relations with these spirit beings. And some of the earliest cave art actually, uh, of male figures are so cold sourcers like the sourcer of Troy Fair. And, uh, it is a, a horned, uh, kind of deer type, uh, being that is also, uh, a man. Clearly I've got a penis. And, uh, and so it's a fusion, uh, images of it online. Oh yeah. Right. Can you find that the sourcer of Troy, t, r I. S and then two, or why us Frere. T. F. R. E. R. E. S. Don't guess, if you didn't get the name of Troy for air,

Speaker 7:          00:52:22       um, what do you think that is? So you think that these are real, real beings of these people were coming in contact with through psychedelic experiences.

Speaker 6:          00:52:29       It, it's possible, you know, and that, um, or it's a portrait of the sourcer, uh, that is an integration of, of yeah. Of Human and animal qualities. Now this is an enhanced, uh, version of, it looks very similar to that, but it's on the side of a cave. And so they would, um,

Speaker 7:          00:52:53       go into the code. The real one, Brian, that's what they did is they traced it so he could see what it actually looks now. That's still amazing, isn't it? So, so that whole arm, there you go. So the archetype, wow, that's the real one. Yeah. That's amazing. That is amazing. It tells you quite a few things. It tells you, uh, the

Speaker 6:          00:53:13       Shamonic, uh, you know, um, x Ray Vision, that is an ancient kind of quality of vision that sometimes you appear to be able to see through to the lifeline are to the underlayment of the fabric, of the body, of the physical body to it, another kind of body. But here it's mostly the fusion of the human and animal archetype can see he's got a Johnson

Speaker 7:          00:53:42       down there and I love his eyes. Yeah. Yeah, I know. Isn't he awesome? Completely awesome. Oh yeah. Yeah. I got that business. I got you like Matt Tail. Yeah. He's like letting you know. Yeah. Right. I know, but he's not hard. So he's not, no, no. Exactly. He's not needed. Yeah, I can look behind. What a strange, very strange. What is, what is that getting out sweet duty? That's a weird little, it looks like a little mushroom. Maybe it does. Maybe it is. It's at mushroom up his ass. Could be most of them coming out of his ass. That's controlling his mind. Wow. I'm

Speaker 6:          00:54:24       sorry. How old, uh, can you look at check the date? I think it's at least 16,000, 16,000 years old. Yeah. They, you know, the most stable civilizations. I think we're from the earliest a work of art that I know of is this amazing picture. I'm sure you've seen it, of this goddess that, uh, made out of mammoth ivory and it looks like Dolly Parton or something. It's an amazing, uh, you know, buck some goddess and it's so, uh, archetypal it 40,000 years ago. Okay. So they were still, uh, having these figurines like the Venus of Willendorf and things like that tens of thousands of years later. Now there isn't a civilization on earth that was more stable than the goddess worshiping cultures. They were agricultural. They were stable, sustainable relationships with nature. Is it just that human beings get to a certain level of technological proficiency and then they just start to fuck each other up really easily.

Speaker 6:          00:55:34       And that's when things go wrong. Well, I think that there was a remarkable breakthrough in human consciousness that led to, uh, a cerebral, uh, kind of, uh, you know, fire of intelligence that led people to begin to write and to write in such a way that, that they could commune with the Gods. The earliest books were all religious texts, you know, 6,000 years ago, you know, the vedic hymns can the rig Veda, you and you know, that's got references to Soma. The, uh, the most ancient of these, uh, uh, psychedelic Brahma better than Indra. Exactly. And connects us with the, uh, immortality and, and uh, infinite,

Speaker 6:          00:56:24       no one knows by the way, what's so my, it was correct. Exactly true. Now, a lot of different people have different consents, uh, conjectures, I have no idea, but it was clearly a kind of, um, NT agentic a sacrament that allowed people access to the realm of the divine. One of the things that Mckenna said, Terrence Mckenna. So that was so fascinating to me. And so when, when you really stop and think about the history of human culture and psychedelic usages, how could something that was so powerful where they talked about it with great reverence and their scripts, how could that have gone away? How could people forgotten what that is? I mean, that's, it's amazing. Well, we're very distractible

Speaker 4:          00:57:05       and, uh, we are not certain about the, um, kind of, um, the game that we're in. Is it an ego game or is, uh, or does love when the day, and, uh, can you find your own personal connection with, uh, the creative source, you know, and, uh, if, if your life is an opportunity for your soul to read the tea leaves of your reality and, uh, see whether it's in alignment with your heart's purpose, you know, uh, I mean, that's, that's one of the other great reasons that entheogens or sacraments or meditation or Yoga and meditation or any of, uh, many different ways of accessing the imaginal realms. I mean, making art is, uh, that to me. And, uh, so as a spiritual practice, thank you. As a spiritual practice, I think it has a much in common with prayer. If your artwork is in service of love and truth and goodness and beauty, and that would birth a new kind of sacred art as well as these, the access, the now verifiable and repeatable access to the visionary dimensions provided by, uh, entheogens, which has happened in numerous cultures, including the Greek culture.

Speaker 4:          00:58:52       We have the foundation of Eastern civilization and the vedic hymns, uh, mentioning a psychedelic. Then we look at the Greek tradition, uh, and the Eleusinian mysteries, also a 1200 year old rubbish. And that's er, uh, and civilization really pretty long time actually for civilizations and very profoundly important. And all the philosophers that we're familiar with, Plato and Aristotle and Socrates would have been initiates and the Eleusinian mysteries. And so, uh, these great thinkers that form the foundation of, of Western civilization had to haul, uh, taken a psychedelic and uh, enabled them to, um, commune with the Gods and with the ideals. That's why Socrates whole platonic forms or you know, that he talks about the ideal realms, uh, that he describes are him clearly and contact with a visionary reality. One of the most famous tales about Socrates is he walking across this square like he did every day and he stopped in the middle of the square. He just like started talking and arguing with this. Um, Damon, he called it his Damon and this was his, this visionary being that he communed with and had a day long, 24 hour exchange with in the middle of the public square watts. Yes. He was crazy.

Speaker 6:          01:00:24       He was high as fuck. It was crazy. He might have just come back from the Eleusinian mysteries, ran to arrest him today. If someone did that, they would, but they knew he was frickin sock gritty's they already knew, give him space. And of course, well, you know how he wound up, you know, he was martyred. He, you know, they didn't want him around, you know, he corruption of the youth. And uh, so he had to drink this poison. Did he have sex with a bunch of young boys? It wasn't that also part of his thing. What was, uh, uh, I, you know, you could say, where's the verification? Right. And where's the notion that that wasn't a, uh, something that was mutual and wears? Just say that some of the gay, uh, artists weren't the greatest and art history, like Michelangelo, like Leonardo, does their gay nes suddenly make them bad?

Speaker 6:          01:01:21       I don't care if they did. Fuck, no, I certainly does. But you know, it, you know, might be an interesting sidebar about history. Well, that's what I was getting at. Like what was it, what was different about life back then? That was like a really common thing that men will have sex with young boys. And even if it was a, um, a mutual thing where it comes into question, that's when obviously when you talking about like really young people that you can't really have a mutual, you know, if you, if you look at the ideals that Socrates spoke of

Speaker 4:          01:01:52       truth and goodness and beauty and being in contact with the ideal realms where you commune with these, uh, you know, angels and you get communication from the highest, you don't, uh, go about messing like that. That happens at the, at the kind of a perversion of, you know, what the intention of God is, I believe.

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       But in terms of, of, uh, reaching, uh, you know, like he, he was, uh, just, he was interested in what was just, you know, he wasn't interested in, in, uh, molestation. So you feel that those are just false charges against him or do you tap the Austria is just tower he's going for, if, you know, what we like to do is trash all of our heroes to make them as low as possible so that you have no hope about human character. And I think that's shame. I have not. I did not look at it that way. When I heard this read this, I, I, I kept hearing about this and many, many civilizations. I mean obviously the Greeks are famous for the Romans were famous for it as well, and my point was merely that was sexuality viewed as a completely different thing. I've been, the way we view it today, I'll play.

Speaker 3:          01:03:13       Yeah. I think it's more that there was going a molestation thing, I think are, we're very repressed whether we believe it or not, and I'm not saying you should start having sex with young people, but we are incredibly repressed when it comes to sexuality I suppose. And I wonder if back then it was just the ideal was different. The, the, the, the literally the way you thought of life was different and it's, I think it's very hard for people. I think you're right. Yeah. I think it's very hard for people to wrap their heads around that, especially if it comes to something as controversial as, oh my goodness, it's still, you have to be a check. Look at different, if you're, if you're on an anthropology article, uh, kind of, um, fan and you really look at different world cultures while yes, you can see they've all got one head, two arms, two legs in general, and have two sexes and uh, come in a variety of colors and uh, things.

Speaker 3:          01:04:12       But there are many different cultural practices that work uniquely for each little niche of a human civilization or culture. And it's astonishing really. Yeah, it's, it's, it's different in different Crinod I'm sorry, in different times, you know, oh, we believed this then and then now we don't do blood letting so much anymore. You know, what haven't we done? Well, um, how, how fascinating are you, uh, by the Maya and the Mayan culture and there if there was ever a culture like so severely obviously impacted by psychedelics. It's really true. It's like the whole culture. I went to Chichen Eatsa, I had a really, uh, educated, uh, guide. It was a guy who was a local professor who took us around and you know, he taught like more openly than I've ever heard anybody talk. Cause I didn't even ask him. Started talking about the psychedelic drug rituals that they have and where they would have of an explained was a chocolate and mushrooms. I don't know what it was. I believe it was [inaudible] he froze the flesh

Speaker 4:          01:05:18       of the gods and they mixed the chocolate and the mushrooms, which has done to this day. It's delicious. Chocolate is so good for you too by the way. I end. Yeah. Yeah. Never had people who will never ever be like raw cocoa, raw chocolate. Especially. It's so, it's super high in antioxidants. Like, you know, like, well it was suicide but it has also gotten, uh, the, uh, the, I think the greatest endorsement from the scientific community. The Johns Hopkins Study. Yes. It corners and Ron Griffiss and it confirming basically the same, uh, uh, discovery from the Good Friday. Cause maybe you can talk some sense into my friend Brian then because my friend Brian has done mushrooms a bunch of times and he doesn't see any transformative nature to the drug. You think she's just taking go?

Speaker 2:          01:06:08       I think the first time you, you, uh, take it, it definitely opens up something in your brain and makes you look at things different. But that will always stay open. But I don't think anytime I take mushrooms from now on it, it might be something positive and I'm on my gain something from it. But it only like a week or two later I'm back. You know, I'm not like thinking about that one trip I did two weeks ago and how much it's changed my life. I'm more like, all right, what's going on? You know, moving on, you know, like it's never

Speaker 4:          01:06:35       have and you haven't properly integrated it then my friend because uh, and, and actually, uh, dousing of one's consciousness into the infinite is well worth considering about how it relates to your everyday reality. And, uh, what, what does it say? You know, what is the nature of consciousness? Who went, who are you ultimately, and what, uh, what does God want a view basically. Yeah. And I believe that your, you know, your entire life is, uh, is uh, basically, uh, an expression of that. You know, it's a natural thing. That's why we call, you know, art our religion or creativity in any form is, uh, this sacred thing. And because it's an expression of ourself, this unique lens through which the creative spirit passes, not him. Nah, it's a wizard of Oz on mushrooms with pink Floyd sinked up. It's not like that, but that's the cartoon level, man.

Speaker 4:          01:07:42       That is like, I mean, if you have any interest in this, don't trip again until you read Stan [inaudible] work. He's not reading shit. Well, you see, if you, if you want to get the most out of an experience like that, a real opportunity to drop into infinite love where you and God become one, uh, you know, you beat your own God self. It is possible. But, uh, in Roland Griffiths study, it was a those who, um, actually we're interested in contact with spiritual reality, uh, who had an intention, uh, about it spiritually inclined. People, uh, were the ones who were opened up 65% of the time. Now each of them thought it was a positive experience. Not all of them, you know, got all the way to the mystical experience, but the mystical experiences, something pretty well defined. And once a person actually has that experience, it's um, it's affirmative.

Speaker 4:          01:08:47       It's so affirmative that you reorient your life to relate to it. And it may not change your outer appearance of, of your life, but it may empower it in some way with hope and you know, new kind of creative dreams that, you know, where's your creative flow coming from? It's not just cashflow, it's got to be, you know, connected with, um, whatever you feel like your creative spirit is. I, you know, I have no problem with the word God, but a lot of people have trouble with that. But I think that it's a legitimate way of thinking of your relationship with a spiritual reality.

Speaker 1:          01:09:21       Just to play devil's advocate and you know, only so that we could answer the question. When you, when you, you, you talk about these people that wanted to have this experience and then had the 65% of them, I mean, how much of what we're talking about is real and when you go into it with good intentions to have some sort of a visionary experience, how much of it is your imagination? How much of it is your imagination acting with a, a hallucinogenic drug to produce this euphoric state that you think is visionary contact or some sort of spiritual contact? And how much of it could just be your imagination mixed with drugs and this is what you were looking for. So your imagination created it for you. And I'm not saying that that is bad or good because I don't, I have a feeling as I get older, this makes more and more sense.

Speaker 1:          01:10:12       Even though it's harder and harder to talk about, I have a feeling that things are neither real nor not real. I have a feeling that the, the way we try to define things in such simple terms, it, I don't, I don't necessarily think that the imagination is not real. I think the imagination has some sort of weird impact. The mine detention and the creativity has some sort of a weird impact on reality of course. So that's what that is the evolutionary edge of reality. That creative spirit is evolution in action. Is that weirdly defined when you use the word God, weirdly defined eye, that's God's paintbrush. You know, w who created all this, not you are or me. You know, how much of, of all of the spectacle of reality did we really have a part in creating, right? You know, but when you say it, when you're saying, God, I, I completely agree with you that that is the most, uh, the most beautiful way to God.

Speaker 6:          01:11:14       And probably the most, if there is some sort of an overwhelming power to this creative force, they all describe the, this sacred a reality as a creative force. And uh, it, uh, at the first moment, you know, and it's the declaration, let there be light. Let there be, you know, it's that it's the positive affirmation of the creation, you know, like what is it, 13.7 billion years ago, there was an affirmation that took place and where the living result of it, the evolutionary wave has brought us to this moment and it's an awesome, awesome thing if you really look at it, you know, you know, 4 billion years of evolution on earth practically and, and from blue green algae to human beings gibbering at each other on a radio podcast, holy and we are to the future just like Amoebas are absolutely no question about a tiny, one of my question was when I said does, does it weirdly define it to use the word God because the word God to a lot of people does not mean that too.

Speaker 6:          01:12:22       A lot of people, and probably most of the world, the world, the word God means a deity who created the earth and did it with certain intentions and has rules that you have to follow or there will be repercussions. It's a completely different kind of God than what you're describing. Well, it's, it's, um, if one would give themselves the, the pleasure of being introduced to the various faces of God, you know, it's that, uh, to uh, expand their mind beyond the any dog don't, uh, really submit to the authority of any religious dogma until you've examined reality and it has to jive with science. You know, your, we have awesome tools now for actually analyzing reality and measure shit. So don't leave that out or, or discounted or anything like that. And, and uh, so it has to have a sense of justice, all the rest of the things that religion has always had.

Speaker 6:          01:13:25       And that's why if we enacted our creative spirits in the service of love, and that's what happens at Disneyland, you see that, that there's a lot of love and families to come what may, and they yell at each other and they don't get along and they're bitter and whatnot, but maybe for a few hours they can suspend themselves and just delight in being together. Uh, having a visionary experience. It's, it's a kind of a drop down visionary experience that takes you outside of yourself. You get pulled in, you lose your ego for a moment and join in a collective imaginal experience. And by the way, ladies and gentlemen, if you're playing the Joe Rogan experience drinking game and you drink every time someone says the word experience today, you're dead. You're not going to make it. Don't play this shot. Stop it. Don't play this game. Um, my, my just point was that the word God has already, it's like so many people.

Speaker 6:          01:14:26       I absolutely agree that, that your concept of God must evolve. It can't be stuck in a fundamentalist, a definition. Just like our definition of religion as Bob Jesse, my dear friend who, uh, council on spiritual practices, he said, Alex, you know, there's a, a, a primary religious experience and then there's everything else, you know. And, and so the primary religious experience was this contact with the divine. And, uh, that was at the heart, the mystic. Every one of these world, we said eastern and Western civilization started with psychedelic reality. Okay. Then look through all the major world religions. They all started with this visionary experience. You know, uh, uh, Moses sees a burning Bush with the guy next to them have seen at burning. I don't think so. It was his neurons that were burning. He was, he was ignited with this voice of God. And with this experience of this fire, not unlike Joseph Smith's fire, a fire, which is a visionary fire and know that Jerusalem scholars have recently started attributing that to a psychedelic experience.

Speaker 6:          01:15:43       Oh, well, there's actually science behind it. Apparently. The acacia tree, Aha. DMT that Bush the Acacia Bushes, very common in that area. The burning Bush. He talks to God. He finds out how eventually shit, the DMT trip was the foundation of this, uh, uh, Jewish. I'm completely messiah. Nothing like nothing. What was the man growing out there? Man? It's going down. It's a good question. Was that the growing on the sacred calf that they were worshiping because like, hey man, we eat the stuff, the goose poop. You knew? Well, yeah. I mean, no question. That was, uh, not, not that, just that cows were worshiped because of that. There was a sacker. They were, you know, the, they, they didn't eat them because they were worshiping them because they created these, these mushrooms that would let them communicate with God. Exactly. There can be no clearer when you're talking about poor people in India, there could be no clear example of an entheogenic being a, a connection to God that then you literally don't kill these animals that you could use for food.

Speaker 6:          01:16:50       You literally start, but you do milk them and it, and it's of interdependent, kind of symbiotic, um, positivity, you know, for each one. And there's a, a friendship not to develops between the creature world and the human world, this sense of comradery with the creature world. But in her case, the actual creature in Disneyland, we don't experience these creatures all the time. We live in the cities. We forget about our connection with the creatures. And so a trip to Disneyland may remind you, even if, uh, you know, in a anthropomorphized way, um, but they have really been working on that too. They'll go down a, you know, an open, uh, as zoo, uh, element and try to try to care for animals because they're part of the human story. The, the animals are branches on the evolutionary tree that we're in relationship with in this mighty evolutionary patchwork that is the mycelium of consciousness on the earth that's runs through everybody.

Speaker 6:          01:17:57       It is pretty fascinating that we, I mean, humans for the most part, think of animals. You think of your dog, your cat, and then some shit that's in a cage somewhere that you can go stare at or something that you can watch on the DVD. But it really is fascinating when you stop and think about the vast majority of animals on this planet are not us. Like, this is not our planet. We are on this thing. We've just figured out how to build these really stunning structures that keep them out for the most part. But he has, like, there's, they've been spawning coyotes in Manhattan lately. They've had several coyote spottings in Manhattan. Wonderful. Schamens coyotes are, yeah. So the cat eaters, that's what they are. Yeah. And rat eaters may be, and they're coming in for help. You know, and it's interesting to see who thrives and who, uh, declines in the animal populations in these really difficult times.

Speaker 6:          01:18:52       I'm afraid we're going through mostly caused by humans. And as far as like the polluting, of course, the heating up of the atmosphere and the, and the, um, political suicide and, and, and, you know, it's like, I feel like, uh, it's the mighty mission of art to try and uplift humanity beyond itself. Destruction. You know, this is why all creators need to really consider the ethical, um, Stan that they're taking in their culture and, uh, not just, uh, be like soldiers of fortune. Uh, if you're selling your soul that cheaply, you know, if you're not taking people to some kind of creative source and positive force that is at the heart of their own creative spirit. If you're not trying to ignite and uplift a people souls, what are you doing? Why are you doing it? What about people that would just try to be entertaining? Is that uplifting someone's soul? I mean, it should be IP. Is it always at the expense of someone or we, are we always making fun of people? Is that the highest that we can reach for in terms of our, of our, uh, I mean, it doesn't hurt to disarm are kind of, uh,

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       pompousness, you know, to try and knock down everybody. I think that there's positivity in that, you know, so that we're, you know, less, uh, less pompous. Uh, some of my favorite humor is people getting shit on cars. I so do I, and we love the drama Kinison and, oh, he's amazing. And, uh, my friend Joey d is just yell at people for serving them ranch dressing. It's very negative, but it's hilarious. It stirs things up. Well, you know, we split off fiction. It's, it's, it's like watching a movie with fake violence in it. You know, it's like watching people get killed by Werewolf's. You know, it doesn't really freak me out because there's no where Wilson, it's not real. I enjoy it. It's fun. It's just a silly created piece of art. It's a ride, you know, and it's, you know, it's obviously it's, somebody has expenses.

Speaker 3:          01:20:56       That guy who fucked up and went in the basement, that guy gets it, you know? Yeah. But it still, I still enjoy it. What does it feed in them? What does that feed in comedy? What is it? What does it feed in the human soul? Well, it gives the human soul and escape for a short amount of time and get some to think about how ridiculous something that someone just said, even if it's really negative, how preposterous and ridiculous it is, especially done in the form of standup comedy. And uh, for me, I just enjoy it as an art form. I enjoy offensive comedy as an art form. Like I enjoy Andrew dice clay. I think he's hilarious. I treat him like I treat a band that I enjoy. I like what they're doing. I like what they're doing. It's fun for me or you not zip.

Speaker 3:          01:21:40       It's a work of art. It's certainly not if I wanted to talk to him as a human being and that was what his point of view on life represented. No, he's saying a bunch of shit that is really silly and he's doing it to, you know, in this character, cause he's knows it's funny, he knows what he's doing. He's no, he knows how to make you laugh and it's not, there's a big difference between that and it representing his life philosophy, representing who he is, the person. It's art, you know, stand up philosophers. Yeah, we do. And we don't. We also just need comedy. You know, there's plenty of philosophizing going on in this podcast. You know, if I applied this amount of philosophy to my standup, I'd fucking, no one would show up that people would go to sleep after a while. They built to come to command someone's attention for an hour and 10 minutes.

Speaker 3:          01:22:28       You have to be funny and you have to work on being funny and it's like you, you can't have, there's a certain amount of philosophy that people will upset except, and certain amount that if you try to get a point across, you have to throw in, you know, you, you really have to explain people where you're coming from. But the beautiful thing about the podcast is when I was younger, I always thought that like one day I would have like a message, like as a comic, you know the, my comedy was so juvenile and ridiculous and it's a lot of it is about sex and stupid shit and I was like, well someday I'll, I'll, I'll evolve my comedy to the point where it's like it's got like a message because I admired certain comics that had that. But then as I got older and especially as I started doing the podcast, that became less and less interesting to me.

Speaker 3:          01:23:12       Like I don't want to hear your point of view through stand up. It's just the same way. I don't want to hear a complex idea described through a song. I want you to tell me, tell me what you're really thinking. And they explained to me over with all the words possible in the most descriptive and intricate and objective and subjective way possible. I want you to explain it to me with your own work. And you do that just through standup. It's eliminated medium. It's not what it's for. It's for. It's for cracking jokes. It's for making people laugh or if it it's, it's at someone's expense. The way I feel like it's tough shit. You should be able to take the hit if you're not looking at this instead of feeling so serious about it. Not only that, I don't think it's good to enforce the idea that people should be so fucking sensitive when it comes to people communicating about them.

Speaker 3:          01:23:58       I think there's far too many people that get butthurt too easy in this country and this world and this in this universe. I think we have to be able to make fun of things and you have to be able to laugh at your own self. Right? And when you, when you say, oh, is it someone else's expense? Sometimes they need that shit sound. Some people are ridiculous. All right. Some people will look for every fucking opportunity to cry or be negative or whine about shit or do something stupid. And those people, I think it's culturally, it's important to knock them down. It's important. It's important to all laugh together and it's important for them because if they're doing ridiculous behavior and you highlight that ridiculous behavior, it benefits them because now they get a chance to see that, oh everybody thinks I'm a fucking dummy.

Speaker 3:          01:24:42       That's part of how we evolve consciousness by becoming conscious of something that appears to be a wrongdoing. And if they can't accept that they, all they're doing is dragging their heels behind the evolution train. That's what they're doing. They're kicking at the dirt trying to slow down the train. They don't want to evolve themselves. So they don't want to have anything. Cause if you're making fun of them unjustly, guess what? It won't be funny if there's no work, there's no truth. Your words, it won't spontaneously make people laugh because you've spoken a truth that no one will say. And it scares the crap out of people. You know, like when Bill Hicks would let loose on things, you know, it was like, oh my God, can he say that? He said that, you know? And every time he would say something, you know, it was like, oh, oh my God, I didn't know I was going there and there.

Speaker 3:          01:25:30       And it was a genius, you know, of, of uh, uh, carving territory. But he also, if he, even if he painted hell, he painted a little bit of heaven too. And I love that about him. Yeah, he really did. He had some great points that weren't necessarily even funny, but he wanted to make them when he, when he was doing certain bits and, but he was so interesting that he carried it anyway. You know, he had this like thing that he wrote down, uh, look, uh, the bill Hicks rules for standup or something like that. I forget what it was, but one of them was, I'm paraphrasing

Speaker 1:          01:26:03       it that you didn't always have to be funny. Just be interesting. Like there's sometimes you, you, you use the funny, you get the funding there and then you could tell him something that is entertaining for a brief moment. Just not necessarily funny. You know, it's a, it's a tricky thing to do in stand up, especially at not be preachy. That's where shit gets annoying for people to go see a comedian and they get really preaching. Yeah. Yeah. Because it's the intoxicant of the stage, you know, you're allowing people to have a massive amount of control over the influence that they have on you to stand up on top with, with a big spotlight on you and an echoey voice and you know, magnified voice. All of that is ridiculous. So because you're in this situation there, there comes a time where a lot of people do things just because they want, they want people to think they're smart, they do things just because this is going to get a big impact. This is going to, and then they got to start getting really preaching. And that's what it is. It becomes disingenuous. You lose this connection with the comic Ma.

Speaker 4:          01:27:03       I saw a lovely Tom on do something extraordinary, you know, like, uh, signs of intelligent life on earth or something like that or that was very good. And, uh, even, you know, even though, uh, it came out of love and self reflection and that kind of thing is really rare and I'm, all I'm doing is saying all of culture is necessary and every, the freedom of expression as as a guaranteed absolute, I think in the, uh, and it's the only way that the creative spirit can feel free enough to do anything and to explore, uh, and evolve into territory. But if you're going to then call it something like sacred art or if you're going to try and reintroduce, cause my wife and I had these mystical experiences and what are you going to do then? Oh, I think I'm just going to make art about the marketplace.

Speaker 4:          01:27:57       Cause that's the only thing that's going on these days. You know? Or maybe I should do some kind of vulgar, uh, transgressive thing to really make a spectacle and things are, or maybe I should, uh, critique corporate, uh, vacuity or something like that. No, the mystical experience. That's the most important thing. And throughout history, uh, see the reason that Bob, Jesse said, I don't give the fundamentalists the word religion. It's, you know, then, then, okay, you can't evolve that concept. It's too important to concept to let go of. And uh, so you have to evolve it. You have to take it on and say, okay, there was a primary religious experience that was the mystical experience that was the visionary experience that contacted, uh, such as the Moses moment or these various kinds of things. Those things recur and they continue. And, uh, so there is a contact with a sacred reality.

Speaker 4:          01:29:00       And if we look at love, just people still believe in love and they feel it from Ah, they're kids and thinks now that means love is a cosmic force, God or Creator, whatever name you want to say, or just the big bang brought us. And in a, uh, if anybody looks at, uh, the, uh, amount of intelligence that it goes to create a cell, you know, Dr. Hoffman, Albert Hoffman, uh, discover of LSD use to, uh, talk about, do you think it would be possible for the parts of a cathedral to be laid out on a football field and to assemble themselves into a cathedral? Now, uh, you think of the unlikelihood of that even given the, you know, like an infinite time and you know that it takes intelligence to build a cathedral. And he said a self reproducing cell is much more difficult to construct than a cathedral.

Speaker 4:          01:30:06       And it is done in such a, um, my microscopic way that, uh, you have to, I a good scientist would simply infer that, uh, the, uh, intelligence, uh, that constructed the universe is at work in, in so many systems that we see around us. And uh, you would even if you, part of your small mind is absorbed with the daily bullshit that comes floating by you're a screen and you get upset about it and you get hooked into your emotions and all that stuff on the background reality. If you could just lean away from the bullshit and, uh, tap into the infinite, that is always there. The divine creative spirit that really turns people on. That's the thing that people want to experience. The ecstasy of creation, you know, and when you're even gardening or when you're cooking a new kind of soup, or you're being creative, you're happier.

Speaker 4:          01:31:07       You're not thinking about the, the thing that she said you are, the, or the thing that he did or, or how terrible the world is or anything like that. You're, you've transcended the chatter of the mind, Bruh. You know, briefly and entered a creative flow that is an intuitive flow that is just a, just a plane of consciousness, higher, uh, than the most of the current, uh, video screens that people are tapped into. So if you could just begin to lean away from that mental stuff and back into the, the, the creation that brought us here, then you'd see like, wow, okay, things aren't really so fucked up actually, you know? Okay. So we blow it. Look at the magnificence of this, um, intelligent, uh, evolution to a point where we have, even though we don't know what reality is and it, and it, this part of the imagination and consciousness, these are great mysteries.

Speaker 4:          01:32:16       That's, you know, that we are God speaking to God. We're consciousness. Uh, speaking to consciousness is the way that I see you. You're tapped into so many networks. You're part of a wider intelligence that in circles the globe and that listens avidly for your independent, uh, advocacy for points of view that are very marginalized in society. It's an extremely important stand to take as a cultural hero to many that you, uh, uh, we'll acknowledge certain things that are not popular, but you feel it's important to say. So your work comes from a place of the heart and a place of justice and a place of a kind of righteous understanding of the multiple dimensions that we all dwell within.

Speaker 1:          01:33:09       Well, it also, my, my point of view comes from a person that feels that like how I know myself and my, uh, tendencies to, to get in bad patterns in my own life and how I've overcome that and how I've sort of molded my mind and changed the way I thought about just reality, my interactions with human beings, all these things. I know that I'm not unique in my ability to do that. I know that a lot of people have done that. I can do that and are doing that. And one of the things that's been the most positive, uh, benefit of this podcast for sure is running into so many people that have said that listening to these conversations and, and, and taking in these different points of view, these well-considered points of view has, have actually benefited their lives, changed their lives. People are eating healthy. Isn't that awesome? Exercising? Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:34:02       It's direct to transformation. It's, it's the, um, I guess the fourth quadrant of how, uh, art and a podcast as a work of art. Yeah. It's not only visually beautiful, but, uh, you know, uh, Brian's been weaving in the sound effects and that it's a work of art that's not art. Don't tell him that. Sorry. Okay. Okay. But doing, I don't want to inflate anyway, but I'm saying

Speaker 1:          01:34:27       hour. We'll just be none of that. Don't, don't, don't, don't encourage them. Oh, you son of a bitch. He's got the Shaman's rattle. That is the Shaman's rattle. Right? Is it shaman or Shaman? Uh, I've, I've used both at varying times. Yeah. It's a tricky one. It's like Bahrain, Bahrain. Um, so you're, you're, you, this gentleman who you quoted about the use of the word religion,

Speaker 3:          01:34:58       don't give it up to the fundamentalists who feel the same way about the word God. It's like, don't give it to people that have a narrow definition of it, just use it, use it. Even though there is a standard definition that a lot of people sort of think, oh, your religious, are you a Christian sir? Do you believe Jesus is your savior? And then things get strange.

Speaker 4:          01:35:16       Well that, yeah, the ideology can in small in us and it absolutely does. And so, uh, the real religion, the primary religious experience is direct contact of self with God. Now that is still valid and important.

Speaker 3:          01:35:37       And then the ability to let go and reach these strange realms of higher consciousness that are available with and without help from any sort of entheogens. Absolutely. Prayer and meditation alone as the Royal Road, you know, uh, the mine is very variable. It's very variable in its frequencies. It's very variable in where you can take it. And, uh, my, my own experiments with a [inaudible] experience, a part of my life is isolation tanks. A huge part of my, my development as a human,

Speaker 4:          01:36:08       that's a fabulous kind of late 20th century, uh, uh, addition to spiritual practices. And unfortunately really, really, uh, found it. And he was one of the psychedelic fathers of, um, this, I, I see,

Speaker 3:          01:36:26       by the way, I should say something about Lilly, but just came out today. They're, they're showing me on Twitter. It's going crazy to ketamine used to cure depression. Wow. They're saying that it's one of the most effective, cute uses of a, a cures for depression. They've vibraphone really simply one dose. One dose has an impact at Saint John. They were saying that for sure, but, uh, you know, uh, I don't, I don't know exactly what they're claiming all he have vitamin B, vitamin, fabulous proponent of ketamine.

Speaker 4:          01:36:57       My God, I, well, you know, ketamine has an interesting kind of, um, shadow side to you that I've seen. Uh, it's very dumb, yeah. For people. And I, uh, I never saw that in the classic hose and agendas that were psilocybin or, um, even LSD or DMT. They're not really addictive in the, in the, uh, kind of strict sense. So Ketamine is one of those interesting new substances. Uh, it was extensively studied and the 60s and the Vietnam War and used actually as a battlefield and Dickerman and uh, then a small amounts of it snorted or smoked and various things like that take people into these dimensional, I, it's kind of like a catapult for your consciousness. It goes flinging out, uh, if you're laying down, uh, uh, into, uh, what seems like a very rapid motion of your consciousness going very fast, even though you're laying down and over a texture, a kind of a vast texture. And, uh, we, we had these kind of openings into the void, uh, that were very profound and very, uh, heart opening in a way.

Speaker 3:          01:38:18       It is a, um, a horrible club drug though. It's used very sparingly and it should be treated with great respect.

Speaker 4:          01:38:28       I know, but yeah, I never heard a, uh, like I had a number of, of friends. I never got into it, frankly, you know, I d uh, we were injected with it I think a couple of times, like back in the 70s. And, uh, it was, uh, you know, it was an available thing and, uh, and a psychiatrist gave us that experience and it was, um, it was profound.

Speaker 3:          01:38:51       My friend Todd Mccormick, do you know Todd marijuana activists? Very interesting guy. He got injected by John Lilly himself with ketamine in Lily's isolation tank and he went deep and he was, he's kind of freaking out in the town. So Lilly shoots, he shoots ketamine into himself, gets it another tank and goes and visits him. Whoa.

Speaker 4:          01:39:14       Yeah. What that is, that is high tech shamanism is high tech shamanism that, uh, you know, hey, I ventured into the coincidence control here that I'm not familiar with and it's, I'm really freaking out. And, uh, so I mean, he might've even, uh, had to, uh, you know, pay a little something to his buddies who run the machines, uh, to, uh, get his friend back. What would you, what happened? What a piece of your consciousness would you have to give up? Oh, uh, no. It was just like a, hey, hey, I'll give you my sex. I'll give you my sex. Yeah. Those change from male to female. Really? John Willy,

Speaker 3:          01:39:56       he changed from male to female. I believe he did it. Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, whoa. So you're saying that my friend Todd McCormack in his irresponsible use of ketamine now, so now you just said, well, I don't mean it. I'm just fantasizing. Is that like a dude that dude, did he do that? I don't think it had anything to do with your friend at all. Okay. Uh, it was for him, I'm sure, and have a creative evolutionary step. So Ketamine, essentially, he marched toward the divine feminine and embraced it. That's interesting. Well, a lot of people believe that that is the number one problem with the world is the expression of the fact of the divine feminine. Absolutely. The fact he was Austrian exists in the intelligent life form that is evolving past pass through the, the, the actual form of the, that we recognize matter in, into a nuclear haves. Like what, what else was he then, if, if people are profits, if people are profits

Speaker 6:          01:40:54       of something, he was a prophet of transformation and the use of all technology available for accessing the human bio computer and a coincidence control. Right. And so he really believed in a spiritual reality, but it was a completely informed by a Rica and all the rest of the systems that he was familiar with. But I think a very legitimate, and one of the most densely detailed descriptions from, uh, uh, you know, uh, this trans dimensional realm that we currently have

Speaker 3:          01:41:31       and his incredible invention of the isolation all night. God was such a brilliant, brilliant invention. Yeah. He was trying to figure out how to separate the mind from the sensory input of the body and he couldn't get there with meditation, couldn't get there with yoga. He couldn't, couldn't quite get there. He was always conscious of his body. So he figured out how to do this in the first sensory deprivation tank was like a scuba tank or you had like a, a helmet, scuba helmet and you would float like from your neck. They use that in an altered states, you know, to uh, describe initially the first, it was pretty chronological in that respect. They started off with that sort of a once, right. And then went to the horizontal once they figured out how to use salt in it. But his old ones, he used to have like waste evacuation systems. Yeah. Well he would shit and Piss in the tank for a long, long

Speaker 6:          01:42:17       time. You know, the uh, you know, because he was interested in long term immersion. Yeah. And uh, this was basically a replication of something that had been done for many centuries. I'm sure you're familiar with it. You know, the young teat practice and a Tibetan Buddhism is all about the dark retreat. You go into the dark and uh, yes, uh, uh, you know, all these things that he talks about that you're still dealing with gravity, blah, blah, blah. Uh, but the intention is the same, to remove all distractions and to be surrounded by darkness. Well, I wouldn't even call it a distraction to be awake. Um, you know, and you could lose consciousness of your body so much and are able to access your imagination. Now, Ibn Arabi thought that at, and he was a Sufi mystic. Uh, my favorite, uh, your favorite Sufi missed tab 10 wow.

Speaker 6:          01:43:19       Room. He wouldn't be right next to have cars, you know, but Eben and Robbie was the most scholarly and he called the imagination your angel. That is the place where God meets God. And so, uh, that, that is the visionary mystical experience that, uh, runs through all world religions and he details it. And there are celestial hierarchies that, uh, Plotinus describes in exactly the same way they had a cross cultural, although they were writing it at different times. It wasn't dissemination. It was all direct knowledge. And, uh, so these were, these were people that were getting it from the highest, uh, command. And it came through there. Um, it came through their unique lens of their language. And so they each had unique prayers to be in contact with this creative force. And, uh, he really did emphasize the sacredness of the divine feminine. And he's, yes, no [inaudible] been a rock.

Speaker 6:          01:44:24       And, uh, so the great mystics, I've quite often done the same thing, you know, I mean, what do we have more art of a goddess sculptures, you know, the goddess is the symbol of beauty as symbol of love, uh, for humanity. And although it gets perverted and things like that, if you step back and just look at the flow of art history, you know, back from the 40,000 years ago to today, what is celebrated the beauty of the divine feminine and a worshiped, really, really, truly new age. Shamanism, the creation of this sensory deprivation tank is the creation of something that allows you to take this practice of solitude and darkness to a completely new level and literally remove the body, remove the body from the equation. And, uh, Lily Korea, you're still aware of the smell and you're still aware, but it's much less.

Speaker 6:          01:45:19       Not really cause all factory sense is only detect change. As long as you don't Fart in the tank, you're not aware of the smell because you won't be aware of anything. Yeah. Your, your, your nose will stop receiving any changes in see the one you've got? Yeah. It's a, it's is created by this guy, a crash from the float lab. A float lab is in Venice and it's the best place in the country. Wrong. He's a really mad scientist when it comes to it. There's the filtration systems that he uses or the, the highest standard and he's pushing for like an industry standard to try to get people to start taking these things seriously as far as like how you can clean the water to make sure that you could use them commercially. Yes. We know lots about, have you, have you been to Munich and to the float?

Speaker 6:          01:45:58       Uh, experienced though? I've never been to Munich and, well maybe I have, well it was in Germany. I forgot where I was actually. Sorry. It was for a fight. What happens is you go into this huge tank, it's like a king size bed, but bigger of water and eight inches deep I guess. And so you lay down and it's the salt and it's really warm and nice and it goes down to a very, you know, like ultra marine blue doesn't go totally plaque. Oh. And there's, and you can close your eyes and most of the end, and it doesn't change at all and it's, it's just the most pleasant, uh, an amazing, uh, it relaxation kind of experience. And he's woven it into the German businessman. Now they, you know, on lunch hour they'll come in and say, wow

Speaker 3:          01:46:50       man, I really need to unwind. And it's, let's just like a half hour later they're like, whoa. It's just like they were meditating. It does wonders for me, especially after I do Jujitsu classes and I'm exhausted and strained out. They'd like, it lengthens your body, like your, your, your muscles. They contract and tighten it up. And what I mean by lengthen is, is they relax and sort of extend the, they relax and pull away. Like it, everything feels like it sort of just takes a big deep breath like all of your tissue. Like Ah, ah, it relieves so much tension. It's it, by the way, it also, it benefits your body. Um, it's one of the best sources of magnesium because I'm at the magnesium is entering your body through the Epsom salts and your skin. It's actually very healthy for you. Very interesting. We know the, uh, the filtration system that they had was unique and patented.

Speaker 3:          01:47:45       John Daly's no, the one in Germany, in German. And they were, they saw themselves as continuing to work. You know, John's obvious, you know, uh, invention and uh, uh, move it forward also in a similar way to your friend, uh, is doing out there in Venice. That sounds like a great idea though, to have just a really light blue so you can even open your eyes. And just the idea of doing it for as a short term relaxation thing, that would be very pleasant. It's, it's extremely uplifting. And probably the caller has something to do with it. You know, I love blue, like a for professional pool. They found out that the color, they'll a light blue, a light calming blue, like a blue sky is like the best color for seeing objects around it. As far as like seeing edges, the edges of the ball and things like that.

Speaker 3:          01:48:34       That light blue is what it really just a appeals to the eye. I use these two things. It was green, it was green for the longest time, but now they uh, they go with light blue. That that feeling. Yeah, the feeling of floating also, um, the release of all the input that's coming in from the body allows you to take in information better. And what crash has been working on over at the float lab is what he calls a cellular influenced device. And the idea behind it is it is a screen that is fits in front of your, your, your visual peripheral, like from here to here. And it is the lowest emission of light that's physically possible. So you literally don't see the edges of the, the television at all. You see nothing other than whatever is being broadcast. They figured out how tuned that in. It took him years to figure this out. And he has these speakers that are in the water literally on either side of right here. They're all, it's all sealed up and so they're underwater and you're in this thing and first of all, the sound moves, the water, it pulsates the water. So you feel the sound, you feel his toes. He, yeah, you do whatever you want. I mean, would crash is trying to do is get people to start coding, uh, documentaries

Speaker 6:          01:49:48       and uh, instructionals to it cause he thinks it will speed up learning by a staggering amount. That's a remarkable it to immediate kinesthetic. Um, yeah. Uh, kind of taking it on a cellular level in farming your, your cells all over. And also the retention is just far stronger and greater because the fact there's no distractions while it's going on. It's the same as, I mean, in theory this all needs to be tested. But I can tell you that as far as just your sheer horsepower for concentration, to me, there's never been anything like it in my life other than psychedelic experiences. But I consider it a very psychedelic experience. And you know, probably came to him in that state and it was used to study that a thing. That's how the Shama and say, you know, like, uh, the plants told us, you know, it was like the, uh, he was one of the first really a scientist to do deep studies with Lsd.

Speaker 6:          01:50:45       I find that fascinating and I find that so hard to believe. Uh, I don't, I also find it amazing how few scientists today openly discussed psychedelic experiences and are enthusiastic. They'll be ostracized. Isn't that amazing? It's sad. The same reason that more artists don't talk about it either. It's, uh, it's, they're not mutually exclusive. You know, that people have to understand that silly behavior, yes. Can Be attributed to the recreational drugs or recreational drug use at a one that's not what we're talking about. And B, just because someone is involved in something that other people were using recreational doesn't mean there's not some massive benefit to it that can be discussed by scientists on, uh, you know, a really scholarly level. There's something going on that can truly benefit humanity by harnessing a substance that most certainly help people access their expanded states of awareness.

Speaker 6:          01:51:39       Now that is what Dr. Hoffman wanted. And I quote him at length, uh, on his hundred and first birthday, he wrote the most remarkable thing about the promise of the entheogenic sacraments and about how he hoped, because he always felt tremendously guilty for anyone who had, uh, you know, uh, taken a wrong turn or not been a, you know, headed, it had catalyze there a predisposition to a, to a psychotic state. Borderline personality should avoid it entirely. People who have a history of mental illness, you know, without, uh, professional, uh, use, they should avoid these things for sure. But sometimes people take them. And so it, it haunted him horribly. And he, he, he was never an advocate, but he, at the end of his life, really, you know, he kind of told people about it. He, he on stage would say that, you know, I, I sent the size did in 1938, uh, we tested it

Speaker 4:          01:52:45       on animals. Nothing happened, you know, and then five years later, you know, in, uh, April, he, he starts to hear a voice that asks him to resynthesize this particular molecule. Now he sent the sizes thousands and thousands of molecules, but he said, never before had he heard that voice calling him to do a particular thing. So he did it. And, uh, then, uh, April 19th, when he finally, uh, basically dosed himself in 1943, um, at four 20, really? Yeah. Have Four, 19 at 4:20 PM pm, he, uh, in his journal, he writes a, that was his, uh, that's when he took it. And, uh, the origin of four 20, no, no, it's not. It makes sense. No, it isn't. But it's an interesting coincidence. Yeah. And, uh, so I mean, it ha, it may have had some sequential elegance in his own, uh, journal writing. It wasn't randomly that he chose that time to do it because it was an experiment that he was wondering about.

Speaker 4:          01:53:59       But he, but he brewed up the tiniest amount that any, uh, you know, that is for sure not active by any substance known to humanity. Uh, if you take 250 million, 70 gram, you know, nothing happens with anything that's, that's like, uh, uh, what do they call it? Homeopathy, you know, it's that kind of dosage. But little did he know that he had stumbled upon the most potent psychoactive substance of all times. You know, it's, uh, you know, Co many times, uh, more potent and powerful than any other, a sacrament in those tiny mouths. And so, um, he was catapulted into a, uh, uh, a kind of chaos. He thought he was dying, of course. So, you know, and, and he just didn't want to die in the lab. We would, you want it to just go home, you know, to die. And so he was freaking out feeling for sure he had poisoned himself and he and his assistant rode their bicycles back.

Speaker 4:          01:55:00       And of course, that's why they call it bicycle day, you know, uh, four 19. And uh, that he made it home and then they called, it was April 19th, April 19th. It was 1943 at four 20. Yes. Yes. That there was, uh, uh, I, I did a painting and it's in the net of being book. You need to bet the lottery. We need to call, put some numbers on. Well, you know what happened that same day? Probably around the same time. Well, well, there was a Warsaw ghetto uprising that happened in the wake of the Nazis wanting to burn down the war. So ghetto Warsaw ghetto, and it never happened before. There was a spike in the novelty, a curve that day that was off the charts. And, uh, they, it, it led to a siege. It never happened and never happened since. Whoa. What the fuck is up with that? The number. Isn't that interesting? Isn't that interesting? Do you do, does that make sense? It's a synchronicity. That's just a interesting, the, you know, something I've been noticing a, and I can't explain it at all, but it's just one of those mystery things. Like you were saying, like in your dream, you see these various things, you know, they're, they're saying something, they're all, it's almost like God is a Punster, you know, and putting visionable rebus says us for this is a visual language, you know, in front of us.

Speaker 1:          01:56:23       Have you ever looked into all this stuff that's going on right now in, in physics where all these uh, different scientists are proposing? The idea that we're living inside of a simulation and it's becoming more and more prominent today. I got a new thing, technology review.com a new thing published by Mit and this was a sent to me through Twitter. So of course I had to investigate it because I, I'm inundated by this shit. Like, literally every day there's some new study or new proposal about the world being some sort of the universe, the reality being some sort of a simulation. When you see shit like the number four 20 coming up over and over again for 19 and four 20. Do you ever stop and go, well, maybe that's just the way it was written. It's the cosmic code.

Speaker 4:          01:57:12       It's the cosmic wink, you know, there are so many correspondences. Uh, I feel like the, uh, what did, what happened to psychedelic culture after that time, uh, you know, was, uh, there, there came a time of tremendous repression, but first there was scientific study. So they actually established the true merits of these substances prior to them becoming illegal, illegal for political reasons, by the way, you know? Hmm. Uh, not, not for, not and it, and I think it's anti American because America is all about freedom of religion and freedom of point of view. And as Terence Mckenna says, you know, there's nothing ever been a key. I deuced against them except that they give people funny ideas. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:58:08       Well, your definition of America, much like a definition of God is not the popular one as far as the rest of the world. And I think [inaudible] represents, I think of it I'll get with Terry Monster.

Speaker 4:          01:58:19       Exactly. It's Americorp's, that's what I call it. AMERICORP's is that what America has become, right? It's a living death that being perpetrated on the world and it's because of of this, uh, uh, you know, cause out, you know, of this hole to the military industrial complex. Eisenhower warned us about it. She was going to say that. Yeah. And so, so, you know, there are various reformers in government that are trying, you know, really trying to shift things, but they're massive forces, you know, they are cons as the gnostics would say, you know, that are kind of dragging their heels in the evolutionary bell curve. They haven't gotten the message that we're all a unity and that we need to now think about how we can best preserve the life web, not how we can destroy it and make profits for a few years while we watched the weather, uh, go haywire.

Speaker 1:          01:59:17       There's never before been a clear indication that the people who are in charge are not, they're not tuned into the Internet. The they, they, they came about this way. They created this way long before there was an internet and this is how it's always been done. And now that it's being exposed all around them, they're still clinging to this archaic notion of non connection, right? This archaic notion that all of your actions, all of your deeds and all of our thoughts and feelings aren't all connected in some sort of a strange way that we need to recognize a dress end. We need to move forward with that as, as an ideal that we are all connected then. Yes, absolutely not happening. Cover it and we have to recover it. It's a spoil banks. It's not happening with the Federal Reserve or whoever the fuck is in charge of sending us to Afghanistan. Right. Whoever wants to us to actually put, you know,

Speaker 4:          02:00:13       yeah. Well that was a, that was an obvious and huge mistake. There's even a, uh, a page in there called remembering nine 11 before it happened. You know, now I think that it's pretty remarkable, uh, kind of thing that, that, uh, happened era of course, who, but a spook would do something like that. Nine 11. That's a joke. Okay. Emergency, you know, that's a spook that to Joe mean like the, like the nine 11 is the code word for emergency right now outside of America. Question Mark. You know, like that's a reference that only an American would, uh, would play with because, uh, okay. So then we have all the explosive evidence about what happened that day. Now, uh, you know, the burning of the right stock and all of that. Have we forgotten history? You know, that's a massive distraction to, uh, you know, uh, stop the everybody from paying attention to Enron and go into some place that never attacked us.

Speaker 4:          02:01:28       That's, this is your point. The Iraq war, what was that based on? But a lot of lies and Afghanistan the same way that, uh, there a need to sell weaponry and to spend money on these, uh, you know, uh, these mercenaries in order to, uh, satisfy a certain hunger. And this a hunger is the shadow is the set seti and energy that dwells in the desert and is, uh, and we are living off of what we need to become is a solar powered, uh, humanity. We are still struggling with set and Horace who fought an epic battle thousands of years ago in the deserts of Egypt and continue it today. The soul of humanity has to go toward the light and find new energy, uh, means to, uh, to bring us out of our dependence, our addictions to, uh, the destructive web of, uh, this, uh, kind of oil Gorky that we're enmeshed in.

Speaker 4:          02:02:39       So it's your opinion that, uh, September levels with some sort of a false flag event and it wasn't just incompetence or, uh, an attack that was capitalized on by people with nefarious ideas that it was instead plant. Um, or you would only, I would don't, yeah, I entertain that possibility. And I think that the entire affair needs to be examined. But why I was setting that up and to controversial elements that many scientists bring up. Not, you know, like artists, you know, our people's, an engineer has all those, all those people who analyze the actual material and the polling of building seven as the smoking gun. But, you know, you can go down that and look at it. I think it should be examined. But the, uh, what I find fascinating about the entire thing is the nest of synchronicities that, uh, artists, uh, where, uh, exhibiting on, uh, that day, uh, there was, uh, a man who had a studio, an artist who had a studio in a tower.

Speaker 4:          02:03:52       One, a number of artists had studios actually in the twin towers. And, um, his name was Michael Richards, actually. He was a black artist and he was a sculptor and remarkable, wonderful work. You hate himself? Well, he was, uh, he, he was, uh, he was an awesome, uh, that was a bad joke. Yeah. Yeah. Now he's has no relationship to that, uh, uh, fella and just happened to have the same name. And, uh, so, uh, his entire body of work was destroyed practically, uh, when the plane hit the twin towers. And, um, so a couple months later, uh, some of his friends discover, and this a museum in South Carolina that they have one of his pieces once been discovered. And, uh, it was a self portrait, um, and, uh, at Saint Sebastian, you know, but instead of arrows going through the body, they were airplanes. Wow. Okay. Whoa, whoa. Saint Sebastian and the tar baby is what it's called. Wow.

Speaker 5:          02:05:13       Okay.

Speaker 4:          02:05:14       Now that is a fact.

Speaker 4:          02:05:19       Now, uh, I did a painting like an eight, 1989. I was, it was a vision I had the day our daughter was born and it became the painting Gaya. Now, what's interesting, you can look in that book, Netapp being, we were in the World Trade Center September 10th, 2001. Wow. And, uh, I, I put my tag in there actually. And, uh, in the guy a painting, there happened to be, um, two airplanes. And, uh, there, uh, there's also the twin towers. There's someone who looks strangely like George Bush. He's embracing a terrorist and a disease. Dick. And, uh, I had no idea it was used in the Beastie boys. It'll communication album, which by the way, has, uh, uh, I, I can't stand it. Uh, the, the most famous hit from that, uh, from that album was a sabotage. I tell you it now y'all, it was sabotage, right? And, you know, and so there are numerous things planted into the collective consciousness you could say.

Speaker 4:          02:06:35       But then the, the, uh, the comic book of Superman that came out September 12th, actually, uh, had the twin towers surrounded in smoke and how copters were around it. And the first panel panel one, there was a hip hop group. Everybody remembers this thing was released that week after nine 11, uh, there was this hip hop group, the Coo who, uh, had two members there and they were with kind of like punchers and in back of them, the twin towers exploding now, uh, they were prevented from releasing it because it was September 12th. They said, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, whoa. No, no, no, no, no, no. But September 11th in Boston, where's it's released live from New York, this, uh, particular, um, place, uh, this band in Boston, uh, and it had the twin towers surrounded in flame. So you think that this, these people who are creating this art that are, are remembering these images that they're pulling this from some collective from the [inaudible], I mean, uh, close encounters, right? Remember that moment when they all go into the artists, uh, you know, room where there, oh, this one drew it and that one sculpted it. And that one, you know, they all got blazed with something and, and it, it, and it's such a fascinating narrative, synchronicities that I believe it's unprecedented.

Speaker 1:          02:08:04       Well, you, you're, your point of view on just reality itself has got to be so much different than the average person's. How often do you bring up this? I mean, this is a very controversial and strange thing to say. You know what I mean? It's a very

Speaker 4:          02:08:18       requirements saying that it, that you know, uh, that my painting or various other things, uh, necessarily lead to the truth, but they point towards something strange. Very strange. I mean, anybody body examining the evidence, it wasn't premeditated. It, it's remembering nine 11 before it happened. Right.

Speaker 1:          02:08:42       What w what I was saying was this is a, you just the way you have to sort of lay this out. How many times have you had this conversation with someone that you could see him go,

Speaker 4:          02:08:52       oh, okay. Yeah. Looking at the time, show the evidence though. Show Michael Richard Sculpture, which we do in this book. Matt have been and show, show the, um, uh, the folks that, um, DC weren't, weren't fond of it, so I didn't reproduce their thing, but people can go onto the internet and find it. There's many Niecy what does that DC comics, they didn't want the superman panel reproduced in a thing like that. But you can talk about it and you can say exactly what happened. And just to pointing it out, you have a sense of the uncanny. There's a que se uh, and uh, uh, right. They couldn't release that thing would, that's the real image. Yeah. That's it. No, that's not the real image. That was what they fabricated and wire to release that week. But we're prevented by every good sense, you know, to say good grief, we cannot be doing it.

Speaker 4:          02:09:52       Doesn't mean, is that the real image of nine 11 [inaudible] from there? Yeah. Yeah. That was the CD cover. That was the angle. Yeah. So I mean this is a smoking gun of some kind of, of uh, regulatory breakthrough. That was a terrible thing. It was a terrible thing but it, but it leaked through the consciousness of humanity. So you see the power of art as prophecy and you see the power of art as what could it point us toward? We want to see a sacred possibility. We went to look at our highest potential, not look at the destructive. We want to take that power of art and plant seeds of liberation in the minds of, of people, not this kind of negative world of self destructive nihilist a culture and behavior.

Speaker 1:          02:10:42       My point of view or what I was trying to get at was, um, when you go into this sort of a definition of things, it's a fairy fantastical and amazing sort of a, a concept that there is some sort of frequency that we're tuning into and were getting warnings from, from, you know, future events that we'll have a big ripple in time. How has this normally received when you talk to people, I mean you're a very unusual guy. How many people can you talk to about this stuff?

Speaker 4:          02:11:12       I think it's unsettling to most people because, uh, it's, I haven't heard it spoken up, but I hate just happened to be one of the people that got blazed with a vision. I had forgotten about it entirely. I, you know, I knew I had painted some, oh, this was the dark possibility of humanity and this is the light. This is the nature, you know, and this is what we have to in, here's Al Gore with some basket of fruits and things in the guy, guy, guy. Can you pull it up? The guy at painting. And how long did you do this before September? It was a 1989. It was, I had the vision in 1988 the day our daughter was born. You know, how powerful, you know, your child being born is, it impacts you. So as we had been up for three days anyway, and, uh, and I had to leave my wife, they kind of kicked me out and I had to go do an illustration project, but as I was going over the Brooklyn Bridge, I had this vision, you know, and this, it was probably the division, you know, I've Manhattan and the vocoder sound that, you know, but, but I had this, uh, this dip titch uh, kind of think there's a better one on Alex grey.com.

Speaker 4:          02:12:23       But the, uh, but that's basically it. The, uh, the world tree as the great mother and the stress, uh, that humanity, uh, is, uh, causing food. The twin towers and little planes. That's fucking trippy. Yeah. So 1989. And, uh, uh, there was, somebody bought it and, and of course it was in the, uh, the El communication album. And, and, uh, and then I published it in 1990 and the Sacred Mirror book, my first book that came out then. And so that was in there. And, and, uh, um, uh, after nine 11, some people sent me emails and showed me the picture again and I, I hadn't remembered any of that at all. That's amazing. That's really, really freaky.

Speaker 1:          02:13:14       When you think about these ideas and these blips in these, these signals and whatever it is that you tune into when you become creative, you know, when, when you think about the, the impact that the work that comes out of it has on people, what do you think ultimately we're doing here as humans are evolving? Aren't cognitive

Speaker 3:          02:13:32       process. Absolutely. You can't help but be transformative as technology and destruction of anything to do with that. Is there cars? It's accelerating the, uh, you know, the shaft or change to the need for change and to grow. It's almost like we're threatening suicide unless we can think about. Absolutely. And you should together, I'm gonna blow my brains out.

Speaker 4:          02:13:51       The Waking Up is happening a lot through the interconnectedness of the web of technology. Technology had to happen after an industrial period. All of it has been an evolving intelligence that is finally beginning to see it's cosmic origins in this story of, uh, of the universe that we've been discovering and, uh, and the Hubble telescope that shows us the vast ness of space in the understanding of dark energy now that connects everything, the clusters of galaxies that had to exist, that the earth is a rare, uh, kind of, I think of it as the, uh, as this, um, owl chemical, um, balancing act. Well, it's, it's, it's, it's, you know, the Olympic that goes around the sort of, um, whatever the alchemists puts into his retort or into his, into his flask. This flask, uh, then is heated and it has a special temperature that brings the interior to transformation.

Speaker 4:          02:15:07       And it goes through a lot of different stages. But I think of the earth and its sir surrounding geomagnetic field. The geomagnetic field is our limbic. It's our al chemical epic. Now you'll look at the Mars and it no longer has a magnetic field around it. And so everything has died. And so this magnetic field that surrounds the earth is our protection from the solar, uh, flares and the solar heat, the sun. And it gives that beautiful kind of a Rara, uh, that happens. And so just at this particular, uh, orbit, uh, where are we in relationship with our guru, the sun? And we have this attraction, you know, but what is attraction? It's the bending of space time and you're at a particular circulation, but that circulation has the Olympic of the geomagnetic field around it. The US, what the experiment of life can unfold takes billions and billions of years to grow an intelligence that can start to recognize its own source. That's astonishing. That's a great epic journey of the evolution of human consciousness. And that's what's really going on. Don't read the Times. Read Aternity is, as Emerson said, you know, it's a great quote. Do you ever see [inaudible] uh, album cover live scenes from New York City? Cha Cha, there it is. Yeah, it's, there it is released nine 11. Yeah. And has the twin towers on fire on an apple. That's crazy. The, um, the future.

Speaker 1:          02:16:52       How do you, uh, how do you think this is all gonna play out? I mean, obviously you believe that you expressing yourself with love and using art and finding creativity elevates the human experience as do I think there's something incredible about seeing great art in any form, whether it's great music, great paintings or whatever it is. There's something about seeing someone really tap into whatever it is that is going on. When you're being creative, whatever it is that you're really, when you're really accessing the imagination that elevates us. It does. You see that as an integral part of this experience, of this transformative experience that human beings are going through. But where do you see it going? Like, what do you, what do you see wakening to our own? Yeah, I'm

Speaker 4:          02:17:36       creative spirit, our own unique lens into the infinite one that we all are and reflection stuff. Uh, we're, uh, you know, ultimately humanity has a great future. And if you look at the evolutionary bell curve of what's possible for human consciousness and love, uh Huh. And how primitive it still seems that humanity is in terms of their ability to love one another. You know, we've had great teachers from all over the world, you know, teach us the same thing. The wisdom masters say repeatedly to love each other, you know, and uh, not to kill each other. And it's something that is so simple and so true and so beautiful. And, uh, this is the affirmation of the intelligence that built ourselves. We have to tap into the, you know, we, we recently had the guest, Paul Stamets, uh, visit cause him a couple of weeks ago at our fourth summer.

Speaker 4:          02:18:46       Him, what you're referring to is the chapel of sacred mirrors in New York. Absolutely. At the chapel of sacred mayors in Wappinger. Uh, actually we had the great Miko Eco or Eco Miko cow mycologist ECO mycologist, Paul Stamets, who's written extensively about, uh, the power of fungus and the, uh, he's one of the world's experts in medicinal. And, um, uh, just the, uh, the power of these things too. Like he uses them to soak up oil spills, the, uh, oyster mushrooms and things like that have been used to draw hydrocarbons, uh, out of, uh, uh, water that's been polluted with them. And Chernobyl. And the 30 mile radius around Chernobyl, there are funguses growing mushrooms growing that are hot. They're radiation, uh, filled because the mycelium that they fruit from has been drawing all of the radiation from the soil in order for life to come back to the forest there, the deepest oldest plant on earth and human beings themselves diverged from the fungus over 650 million years ago. So we have this connection, this web of connectedness and obviously, uh, uh, a connection with the intelligence of the mushroom and, uh, and Paul at far from being a Terrence, uh, um, sort of endorsing of the, uh, uh, you know, exogenous kind of, uh, um, fertilization of the earth with the spore. He believes it was homegrown and he believes that we're exporting. Uh, so I love that kind of can do earth based consciousness that evolved in this alembic. And for those who

Speaker 3:          02:20:44       don't understand what you meant by that, what would you, you met for the, the story is a Mckenna believes that it's possible that mushrooms came from the vacuum of space. It rise on asteroids as well. It's the theory of Panspermia, which is we know amino acids and certain things are transferred and there are asteroids here from other planets that have land the media rights. And that is also one of the theories about what happened to Mars as well. Right? And that's how they lost their environment. It was an asteroid will impact

Speaker 4:          02:21:11       possible. And certainly we, uh, the human, uh, or the, the great chain of being in great chain of evolution that, uh, was impacted on the earth. Certainly, uh, there's a belief that they media, right. Uh, you know, basically ended the era of the dinosaurs and these little rat, like things that were our ancestors were able to, uh, become more dominant as a species and evolve due to the territorial kind of disputes being over with these large lizard people. Yeah, that really was a nice, nice break for us really. And it had to happen. But yeah, we have big brother Jupiter out there watching our back and it's taking the heat, you know, he's the bouncer of the, uh, whole cosmos a or Arab middle solar system. And so only at a certain level surrounded by a living, kind of a lambic and shielded by a particulars, a kind of a planetary brother was life of this kind even possible.

Speaker 4:          02:22:20       Think of how many billions of galaxies it might take. We, well, we certainly are probably the only, you know, Earth, planetary consciousness in the universe. Obviously, you know, we're a unique little neighborhood. When you say Earth, planetary consciousness in the universe, what do you mean by that? Well, there's no other earth right where it, where the earth, this planet, we're the only ones. We're the only ones it evolves uniquely. Darwin showed that on every little, uh, uh, cov or, or things, things evolve a little bit differently. So wherever else life exists, if it does, uh, uh, in a quite quite likely debt, does it, most scientists would agree that, but, um, uh, is we have a unique jewel. We've been gifted with it from billions of years of evolution. Don't fucking below it. That's the most important thing. Yeah. It's a w w we are saying if people don't understand it is that Jupiter has a massive amount of gravity.

Speaker 4:          02:23:25       It's enormous and it absorbs asteroidal impacts, sucks them all up. It's like the body guard for the earth. It's amazing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's, it's truly unique situation as far as what we've studied in the cosmos. But I might be further evidence. There's a simulation. I'm like, yeah, which is awesome. Well, you know, my experience, uh, with, with Alison, just to inform that one, uh, our first, um, kind of breakthrough, um, psychedelic experience that changed both of our works. It happened about a year after we first met him, like our first anniversary, June 3rd, say, uh, uh, 1976. And we both melted down into these kind of Tour Royito fountains and trains of light and every other being in thing in the universe, which one of these balls of light as like a soul. But it was, you know, like, uh, uh, an amazing kind of tourists. It was like a tornado flow and uh, this thing felt much more alive and real than our kind of material world reality.

Speaker 4:          02:24:39       It felt like this is what's really going on. It's, it's eternally and infinitely light and we are projecting our, uh, kind of souls into experiences to have, uh, um, in reaching educational opportunities and try to wake up to God sent us here to wake up to God, you know, to the core of our being, to our God self. That's why this painting that's on the cover of the net being is called God self because it's a symbol of our interconnectedness with all other gods. Selves is every other being and thing. And the network has access to this great vast intelligence of the, there's no other reason that we could be here

Speaker 3:          02:25:26       when you believe that and think that and then see what's going on. Like with everybody saber rattling about going to war with Iran. Well, what do you, how does that mean?

Speaker 4:          02:25:37       I feel very sad, you know, because, uh, really it's about a breakout the piece, Monkees, you know, don't destroy each other and don't, uh, don't poison the web that sustains you. That is only logical and by toxifying both the consciousness of humanity by, uh, you know, in training people's minds with a limiting self images instead of accessing our unity as a human species and expand beyond that. If you can feel, even though you may hate your neighbor, you now you may have a gripe here or there, but ultimately you connected with loved ones. Love brought us all here. Love is the highest expression of the cosmos. You know, Albert Hoffman said that the highest refinement of light in the universe is love because it took a solar battery like our son to give birth to uh, uh, a planet earth. And it took the evolutionary train billions of years to get here to a point where a consciousness, a brain was capable of having the experience of love, which was the common source of everyone, the love that brought us all here to recognize it in each other, to honor it and each other through all different ways until we celebrate that amazing experience and to try and, you know, turn the ship around.

Speaker 4:          02:27:18       Now folks, you know, don't go over the edge. Don't commit suicide, do something harder. You know? Why is it more impossible as the occupy folks said, to imagine the end of capitalism then? Or Why is it more, uh, easy to imagine the apocalypse than the end of capitalism?

Speaker 8:          02:27:41       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:27:42       You think the, that capitalism is the big problem and it's not just putting hard of morals, it's part of it. Yes. All of that. Because it's not a god centered consciousness. We've wandered away, you know, is it possible though to have a god centered consciousness and produce all the shit that we produced to make all the laptops we make to make all the cars we make? You know what Steven Chops was and to my friend.

Speaker 8:          02:28:06       Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:28:08       Who's in a yelling at his employees. Yes. She's ended up making Chinese people worked for $50 a month. He was into a lot of shit there was, but look at the nucleus of where those things that you were just celebrating came from. Well, he made it his, it was from his LSD

Speaker 4:          02:28:22       experiences. He credited that with being a tremendous opening for him, uh, and informing his, uh, breakthroughs in technology and Kary Mullis, the Nobel Prize winning a molecular biologist has said exactly the same thing. And many people's lives have been ruined by these things, but many other people's lives have been saved. My own, um, the, the Francis Crick story, is that true? You Go, yeah, this is a true, well, you know, it, it is a congested me. It is a, uh, uh, it was released after his death, right. Cause he by threat of deaths had such, and so now you could say, oh, now somebody just trying to hijack that breakthrough of the imagination. But then you go back to when it happened and you realize that actually he was a psychedelic advocate and he had, um, uh, like many of his scientist friends experimented with these substances which were supposed to catalyze the creative imagination.

Speaker 4:          02:29:28       So he had read the papers and he had access to these things. And, uh, so, uh, he, there was no stigma about it. In fact, the first life magazine stuff about psychedelics was extremely positive and there was no stigma about it than what, and he'd come out and say it initially. Oh, because by the time, uh, that it was a, yeah, you would think you would think, but he might not want to Sally his breakthrough by, uh, by, by, by putting anything between, uh, the breakthrough insight and the, you know, then what are you talking about? What, you know, based on a drug induced hallucination. But, you know, I mean, that's how the benzene ring was discovered. It was in a dream, you know, and, uh, so great discoveries come through the visionary imagination. Isn't the Hell Day cargo the idea of science in the first place?

Speaker 4:          02:30:26       There you go. It was a dream that, uh, I think the exact quote was the science and nature will be conquered by using measurement. There you go. Well that was a really important thing, but conquered gives it, yeah, I think I probably use that. That's, but that is an aggressive stance that, that uh, the, um, the male species has, has, uh, promoted because it's very self serving. And I think that, uh, if, you know, part of, uh, what we're doing at this point and as evolving, uh, human beings is trying to create a new model of possibility for humanity and in a realm of sometimes for some people diminishing expectations. So the, uh, Paul Stamets a point of view of how mushrooms can save the world and how mycelium is actually a network of intelligence that connects us with the plant realm and that we can take advantage of by tapping into the nervous system.

Speaker 4:          02:31:35       That's a humanity diverged from over 650 million years ago. Now that's tapping into cosmic intelligence. Do you follow Mckenna's stoned ape theory? I feel like that's the way a lot of people and even responsible anthropologists. Thank that. There's some something to it because they certainly would have encountered the psilocybin mushrooms and who can say that it didn't play a part and catalyzing the growth of human consciousness. Now it was Leary's or I'm in Lilly. Oh, both leary and Lilly ideas was that it, uh, that these substances could advance in the evolution of human consciousness. Now you look at the Uni Oda Veggie Vegetal, which is the, uh, first, uh, psychedelic church for white people, I guess in the United States. Um, and part of the mission of the UDV, which is a church that originated in Brazil, you know, the heart of the Amazon from the green mantle of the earth.

Speaker 4:          02:32:35       Uh, the green emerald comes these great wisdom traditions that are spreading throughout the world with Iowasca and people are waking up to the mind of nature, um, uh, through these plants, sacraments that have been used for centuries, for thousands of years actually. And um, more and more anthropologists are saying, well, they were seeing visions and the, and the place, we know that the bog people used to smoke cannabis and cannabis has been humanities friend for a long time. Now neuroscientists just to, and, and I'll hand the floor over. A neuroscientist in quoted in scientific American said most neuroscientists would agree that everything that we experience is a figment of our imagination.

Speaker 4:          02:33:26       Most neurosciences would agree with this. That's what she said. She might be crazy. She might be, but she had an entire issue of scientific American optical illusions that it's a yearly publication. And so yeah, she argues for this idea of the plasticity of the mind. And when you take these a dimensional shift, you know, I'm like, you're changing the radio station with your, um, kind of dimensional shifting that some, uh, psychonauts are able to do your, you're tapping into different wavelengths so you literally change reality. Absolutely. Literally can change reality. Reality is reality is low dimensional reality is code dimensional. It's not like you, you know, you are, this conversation changes reality in this dimension, but they'd also has a resonance with another dimension.

Speaker 1:          02:34:20       So it's essentially what we were talking about earlier. That's neither real nor not real and that, exactly. There you go. It's a combination of imagination and reality. One of the things that always struck me about imagination is how it's sort of a marginalized, like the idea of all that. Timmy, he's got a vivid imagination, right? You know, there's, there's something to that. But the reality is that every physical thing, including this building that we're in, including this chair that you're sitting in, the microphone that you're talking through, all of it was created through the imagination. So it did not exist. It was thought up through the imagination then became, it manifested itself in a physical form.

Speaker 4:          02:35:03       And we've become basically numb to the spectacle of the creation that has unfolded before us. And if we could remove our blinders and notice the awesomeness, you know, in the lean away from the Jibber Jabber, you know, we could be more at peace and maybe recognized that the same beautiful, uh, true and good stuff that flows through your heart is flowing through mine.

Speaker 1:          02:35:29       Well, if it is possible, I believe that conversations like this are what move, uh, the consciousness of the people who listen to this and the people who consider these thoughts and the things that you've said it, it does move things in a better direction and moves it in the better direction for those people that are listening. And I think if there's any one way, we really can't change this world, it's to change the way people who are open minded view it. If you're open and you, you, you introduce a positive new idea into someone's mind, you know that that can change them and benefit them in a positive way. So if you really want to change the world, you already just did it. You just did it with this conversation.

Speaker 3:          02:36:05       You're awesome. Chow and you're awesome too, man. You, I love you too many. Your, your work is amazing. And for folks who want to stay up on everything you're doing, they can follow you on Twitter. It's Alex. Great. Kozum c o s m um, gray. Why not a y? Um, and uh, if they want to, what is your website? Well, the most important thing that's going on is really the chapel sacred marriage project. We're creating our first sacred structure, right

Speaker 4:          02:36:33       sample. We're building it up there. And it is an incredibly important time for us. Uh, if you look@alexgrey.com at all, uh, well, let's see. And theone is really the, uh, the, um, the thing that we're, we're working on now. And that is this new sanctuary for visionary art. And, uh, it is a multi denominational or trans denominational acknowledgment of the power of the creative spirit. And it's occurring in architecture now. And it's a place to house, uh, the, uh, this thing. It's something else. And an I were shown in a dream. And, uh, she is the cofounder

Speaker 6:          02:37:16       of the chapel sacred mirrors. She inspired the Sacred Mirror series. She named the sacred mirrors. So the honoring of the divine feminine is really at the center of my life and she turned my life around with her love. And so that kind of love is, uh, and the creative, um, evolutionary spirit that goes through everybody is kind of what we celebrate at Kozum. And, uh, so people do a lot of creative. Um, you know, there's art church. We just had an awesome, our church with other visionary artists. It's happening around the world. Visionary artists or like providing cultural alternatives, you know, where a likeminded people, we call them the love tribe because you find them all over the world, you know, who've awakened to something beyond, you know, the stress full politically charged, uh, national boundaries and they're global citizens. They, they are tapped into the world centric intelligence that could help lead us to a planetary civilization.

Speaker 6:          02:38:23       And they, by the way, probably didn't exist 50 years ago. Yeah. So that's the big jump. Yeah. It's one of the things when people want to talk about how bad everything is, they're not aware of how good it is to, yeah. So chapel of secret mirrors is a chocolate, what does the [inaudible] dot Org Alex grey.com has just been a re a revised by our dear friends falling and Scotty beautiful.
