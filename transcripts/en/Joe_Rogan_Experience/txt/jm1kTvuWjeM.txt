Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello Freak bitches, not I recently that, you know, these, the people that want to, to fight and then he got lost me Phi and Blah Blah Blah. And then you find out what they did until the runup or what did you do? Oh, I got drunk, let's see, weeks before hello. What a fucking surprise if you will not live in it. And if you're not, you know, getting, you know, you know, really immersing yourself and in every way in the language that you speak to yourself and in the way that you do everything else. Once you expect your mind's not going to support you if you don't support it.

Speaker 2:          00:32          Yeah. That was one of the things that I felt when Jon Jones tested positive for cocaine three weeks out of his fight with Daniel Cormier, I was like, Ooh. Like he's not even other. I look, I only was anything wrong with doing, I don't know if there's anything wrong with doing cocaine. I just, I don't think it's a positive drug, but some people enjoy it. Um, some people enjoy drinking. I enjoy drinking. I don't think that's positive drug necessarily either. So, I don't know cause I don't have experience with cocaine, but that's not something you're supposed to be doing three weeks outside of a world title fight with one of the best wrestlers in the sport. One of the most difficult challenges you've ever faced in your professional career and you're out doing blow just 21 days before. That's crazy.

Speaker 1:          01:11          Yeah. Sometimes the most talented take the gifts that they've been given and just abused them in a way. I met Jon Jones. He's um, it's different to say the least. And what, where he was, I didn't know he was, it was kind of, I only met him briefly. Why was it I made him in Russia, the legend that is a show there and a, yeah, he was just, he was very sort of, it was all over the place, bouncing around and I just, I just didn't expect him to be like that. Expect. And what do you mean by all over the place bounds? It just, he just said to me, Hi blue eyes and was like, hello, he's my from dangerous and I'm not. I was like, hi. I just found it a bit strange. Maybe I read into with you. I just found him different.

Speaker 1:          02:01          Let's just say that I just found him different and I, I'm trying to read into this. I, and I'm trying to avoid it badly. He, I don't know him. I met, he was, it was different. Let's put it that way, you know? But um, if, if they, if someone, I don't know, you don't know what's going on in his life and you know, you don't know what's going on in his life and you could say that about everyone. He could say that about a serial killer, couldn't ya? But we do know what's going in his life. It's not as full, you know, really. I mean, there is some things that you shouldn't do and you know, he shouldn't be doing it. But these reasons,

Speaker 2:          02:35          if you listen to John's coaches, they will tell you that John Surrounds himself with the wrong people. And John is an extremely talented guy. Amazing. It's like maybe one of the most talented guys to ever compete in the sport and incredibly strong mentally too. Because despite all of his issues with maybe not preparing as well as he could when the chips are down, that guy gets through things. He overcomes adversity. He's not a front runner. He's the one that broke his toe, isn't a, that was terrific. So he's gone, but he didn't even realize that was happening that that happened actually in the final flurry where he stopped chill son and a more impressive performance is when he fought vitor Belfort, Vito or completely hyper extended his arm and he would not tap, you know, it was for his title Vi tour came that close. Was it for the title?

Speaker 2:          03:25          I believe it was. It might've been non title fight, but [inaudible] came find out if that was a title fight or non title fight. Either way [inaudible] came that close to legitimately beating John Jones. That clothes got a lot fully locked in Armbar that would have made 90% of the professional fighters in the world tap. Well that's what makes him who he is. But he, but he couldn't say notice it was a title fight. Yeah. Jamie just looked at him. He couldn't say no to some blow. Well he could say no, he want it. Didn't want us to get some sort of, I don't know of any, his weakness, I don't know these people, there's some sort of weakness, weakness or don't know if it is deliberate, it's not. He shouldn't be something you should be doing. It's also indulgence. It's like he likes to party, you know, but then there's isn't there also the issue that fighters in particular, especially guys that are about a lot of hard gym sessions and a lot of hard fights, they have impulse control problems and those impulse control problems.

Speaker 2:          04:25          I'm obviously not a scientist or a doctor, but when you talk to neurologists and neuroscientists, they will tell you that there are direct correlations between head impacts and poor impulse control. Right. It is absolutely a direct impact. And I, you know, not looking for a scapegoat in my own life, but I've looked back at some of the poor decision making that I've done in my life, particularly in my fighting times, like back then and I was like, I wonder if a lot of that was getting hit in the head a lot. Like, like it can't be good to get kicked in the head. It's just never good. Not In the past, just not good. And so if you've been kicked in the head or punched in the face or whatever, you know, any kind of impact. And that's the thing about football players, they're saying now is it even a shot to the chest even getting tackled like someone rams at you and slams their shoulders into your chest.

Speaker 2:          05:17          The brain gets jostled around. Yeah. You might not have a bruise on your face, but your brain is receiving essentially the same impact as a punch. Yeah, I was just kinda crazy. You know, people might not like, they split it as a shade that Jon Jones has gone. Like, you know what I mean? Cause he's got a lot back on him. You know what I mean? He's got to look back on him and they fuck, you know, he's also got to figure out what it is that he took. You know, they, they don't even exactly to have an isolated what he took, but the whole lifestyle, it's, it's cert most certainly an issue. And it's almost like one of those things where you say you don't know what you got until it's gone. Well, it was kind of gone for a little while, but not really.

Speaker 2:          06:02          He was always still in the mix and there was always multimillion dollar fights, a waiting. And then he fought over in saint proves. So he's back in the mix and everything's looking good. He's slated to fight at UFC 200 against Daniel cormier is gonna make like 10 million bucks. It's going to be giant. And then whoosh, it's gone for something that if you talked to people that are experts in performance enhancing drugs, they will tell you that this clomiphene is what he got popped for, which is an anti estrogen supplement that's not even beneficial. The only time that stuff's beneficial as a set of, essentially when you're coming off of steroids, but yet he didn't test positive for steroids before or after. So it could have been a tainted supplement. It could have been a mistake. It could have been, who knows what wacky shit he was taken. I mean, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          06:53          I just think that, you know, people forget that they locked sometimes you've still got off guidance, you know, you still go, oh, have a guide and you know, to just say, look, is that the best thing you should be doing or someone to talk. So, you know what I mean? It's not going to be high five and you, cause you're going to, you know, stick a lot of bugle your nose.

Speaker 2:          07:11          Isn't it harder though, I think for champions because once they like dominate someone to kick someone's ass, like say if you fight the, the most difficult fight of your career, you fight, you know, uh, well there's Daniel Cormier, whoever it is, you'd dominate them, you win and a beautiful fashion and then you know, you like, God damn it, I am the fucking man. Yeah. And then you just want to do whatever you want to do after that, and it's indulgence and chaos.

Speaker 1:          07:37          Yeah. He did it. Or is both the eight comes to bite you on the ass all the time.

Speaker 3:          07:46          [inaudible] yeah.
