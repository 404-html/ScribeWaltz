Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Scared to ask you too many questions until we get live. Well good. And we're live. Adam green trees fresh from Australia. Fresh from the bush. From the bush. Yeah. It's been crazy. So I was thinking about it and I'm not even la part. I was just thinking. I went from the snowy tops of Montana, got home pretty much had the family today. Death went straight to Arnhem land in the northern territory of Australia. Complete opposite, like just first thing in the morning. This wedding covered in mosquitoes, flat barren ground and then. But now humans like a small indigenous population out there and that's it. Then straight from there, so straight from Arnhem land to Sydney. Met came in Sydney and then straight here to La and Florida and it's just like at night. How many people live here? Too many. Too many. There's more people here than in the entire country of Australia. That's crazy.

Speaker 1:          00:00:56       I never lost all his hair and you're like, you know, this is the safest place on earth of the safest place in the US and those that, a armed robbery or whatever they was in Calabasas say today when we flew in and I went into like a t cell provider to get a Sim card at. Dude walks in, look for dodgy. I knew something was about to go on the dude that was so to me, knew something was going on. I kept seeing him looking over my shoulder at this guy. He grabs a bluetooth speaker and it's like pretending like he's going to go to the checkout and I'm just being polite and thinking there's something going on. So let's just get him down and out of the store. Then he goes to do a full runner for it. Dude, straight out the door with this Bluetooth speaker.

Speaker 1:          00:01:39       But all mate, like had these runners on and chased him down and go to the orpheum. Yeah. Yeah. And um, I'm like, every time I come here there's something crazy going on. Well, if you're in the wrong place, the wrong time is plenty of crazy going on in the show. That's just so many people. There's so many people. That's what it is. Yeah. There's no way around it, but you know, fairly safe fit, shooting water buffalo, each Sifa. Then fucking people's bullshit. That's crazy site for them. People know when you're Adam Green tree may be. It's safer because you know what you're doing, but you were telling a story on whose podcast was it a J. Scott's, I forget whose podcast it was. You were telling a story about one of your friends that got gored federal labor that got gored by scrub bullying. That's not good.

Speaker 1:          00:02:30       No, it's definitely not good. But I did I tell you that story. So what happened? He shot a scrabble telling people would've scrubbed bullets. Yeah. So scrubbing bubbles like a, just like domestic cattle, but it's been out in the wilderness many, many generations. Exactly the way they look and they have like a real feral inbred looking. They're crazy look like rice cooking and they they crazy dangerous. Here's a photo of him we looked at. I mean, that looks amazing. That is such a cool looking animal that was so much different. And that's pretty much a purebred Brahman. That one. There's that one. Whoa. Yeah. That's. Looks like. So when you said it's a purebred Brahma, that means, uh, that's, that's a pretty good look bowl. If you go up the top Jaimee, there's a couple more at the top. That red one that you just done under that one day.

Speaker 1:          00:03:18       That's a pretty typical scrabble a. that's a, that's a fellow that I know actually in Australia. Stick Ball. He's got. Yeah, he's got a by her, that's what we have with. Oh Jesus. Why do people do that to themselves? So the problem with these animals, obviously they don't respect fences and now going varied and interbreed with log of farmer's stock and things like that. Is that, is that bad for the farmer started? Definitely. Yeah. That they'll just go straight through fences and yeah, he'll have a heap of carbs and I wouldn't be purebred anymore. And so they're not, they don't good for rebranding or like my fixed the same value at the market. So what is the difference in like the genetics, like what do they look? They look different, they look different. So that first bullet Jamie showed was like a Brahmin bull, then one of those scrub bulls, which is just bits of frigging every sort of bull over a lot of generations will come in and need and buried with it and then sort of wrecks the hood.

Speaker 1:          00:04:14       And when, when did they get released or when did they escape? Well, it would have been with the cattle that come into Australia. So it would have been hundreds and hundreds. Yeah. So they're just sort of morphed and become wild animals and wild bulls. Very dangerous. Very dangerous. Yeah. So what happened was, Pedro, I shot these bullets, dropped, like dropped unconscious. He fought it was dead, walked up to it. It jumped up. Like he literally got up to it and it jumped off and anyway, it ain't not getting him against the tree. Like he ran to get up a tree. He felt it hit him and it sort of lifted him up the tree. He climbed up the tree is the growth vit. Then he felt something warm and his legs and look down and he's got and everything hanging down. I read legs, but use a tough boss that he gravity, stomach backup and sorta held the.

Speaker 1:          00:04:59       Implies the end. The bull actually died. He climbed down out of the trade, ended up dawn two times, I think once in the air because the royal flying doctors come in, grabbed him because he's a long way out in the middle of nowhere. And uh, and once on the tables operating table as well. He survived all that and ended up dying of a bloody mess. Heart attack. So no way. Yeah. When, uh, it was on the thing, he was only 36 or 37. Do you think it had anything to do with the that I reckon it was related at all really? You would think that a guy could get past getting gored by pushes guts back into, I'm not going to get a heart attack. That's life's not fair. Right? That's crazy. Oh, thank you. Jamie. I think it was adjusting my shoot license card as well. If you don't have shoelaces, you got those fat tires. It's a little in the weeds like those. Everyone asked me about my boots, I'll get a glimpse of me, whatever shoes I'm wearing, my

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       shoot some awesome animal and they're like, what shoes you're wearing? People are gearheads. That's a big thing about hunting is how many people are like crazy gearheads like what? You want to know, what kind of bow you have, what kind of, what sites do you run in? Like what kind of load of old. It's really interesting to me maybe because I've done it for so long, but I sort of don't care about the gears as long as it works, as good as it should, you know, and that's because everyone asks me to keep doing these tip things as well and I hate doing that. I hate listening to them. But if you're a new guy coming into bowhunting, then obviously you want to know. Some people love that stuff man. Like John Dudley's tips that he does, like he does these live instagram and youtube, but facebook feeds or he'll like take a bow apart, put it back together again and explain the cam systems are extreme with it to Hayes Hayes.

Speaker 2:          00:06:46       My go to guy, if I don't know something that I'm doing that's I'll go straight to Dudley. Dudley is podcasts. If you're into archery is called knock on is the knock on podcast is without a doubt the most in depth archery podcast from not just hunting from a hunting standpoint but from just target archery. How, you know, how important technique is. I mean he's a real master. He loves it and he's a super geared to eight years. Has Your, has your cyber October going crazy? It's going good. The sober part's easy. The uh, the hot yoga, we're in the homestretch today was a number 13, so I got two more. I'm banging them out this week. I'm going to do tomorrow and Friday and be done with it because I want to get back to doing other stuff. And when you do a 90 minute yoga class, it's hard to live weights or run or do anything else.

Speaker 2:          00:07:34       You don't really want to do anything else, you know, so I'm just going to bang it out and get it over with. Kim's done at once and she recommends. It was like hell on just the yoga. I think she had a big drinking session before she was in Bali and she just made some stupid promise, bolonaise woman. And then the fifth bolonaise woman's ringing her up the next morning. Like, where are you if a yoga came, just thought it was yoga though. So she's like, ah, I can do yoga in my sleep. And she gets here and it's like in this hot room and stuff. And it might. It was killing us. Bali too. I would imagine. It's very humid, humid. It'd be Muggy as hell. Ari was talking about that today because our, he does yoga in New York, which is way more humid than it is in California.

Speaker 2:          00:08:18       California is dry, so he was probably loving. I just. Oh yeah. We went to a different place today. Today we went to a place that was more mild, so not as hot, but um, it's not, it's your body gets used to it. It's interesting. It's like there's a lot like, uh, you know, I do that cryotherapy style you like did it to yesterday for the first time in about three weeks I guess. And it was hard. Whereas I do it when I do it everyday. It's not conditioned to it. You just get in there and I do, but it's, it's quick how that conditioning goes away. Yeah. I hate to just say the peak tufts that I did, it was pretty bad job of said to them yet, here's are cutters. No, I've never killed a bar. Going to kill the

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       cells. You need to come to Australia. I do, but I'm scared to be honest with you. Every time I look at your instagram feed and I see a brown snake that can kill you or a spider that can kill your fucking saltwater crocodiles. What are you doing? Playing with crocodiles the other day were coming into camp. Dude. There was a couple of, I wish I captured it on video. It was one that she, I think it was a female anyway, she must've been coming around the back of camp unnoticed. So the windshield was heading back to the water. She was literally come and strike through camp to get back into the water. And you could, is that thing. That photo doesn't do that thing. Justice. That photo scares the shit out of me. That's a real. That's a real live monster out there. How big was that fucker?

Speaker 1:          00:09:37       He's about five and a half meters. Whoa. He's giant. He's always, you can even see it in the picture of his body's just a real log crawl. Five and a half meters to Americans. I want you to take about 15 feet marco days. Um, so a few people have been taken at this spot. Mostly indigenous had been grabbed. Granted that spot over the years. And when you see an ancient piece like that, there's a chance. He's a man eater. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They just ruthless. I like. How old do you think? A 15 and a half foot crocodile is. I don't want to comment because I don't know and I'll probably get it wrong. I would like to know like how long does it take them to grow? 15 and a half feet. So if you could find that Jamie Saltwater CROC and I'm pretty sure that I believe over a hundred years. Yeah, they, they live a long time, right?

Speaker 1:          00:10:22       Yeah. So he's ruthless to like people who live in Florida don't get those confused with alligators. Yeah, there are different completely different animals. So we've got the freshwater crocodile which just lives in fresh water. Then we've got the salt water crocodile, but he leaves in both, you know. And so a lot of people get that confused. I call it's fresh water. I'll be right there. Go for a swim. Uh, no. So the fresh water crocodiles and not as aggressive. They're not aggressive. They might get a bit territorial, but they're not going to grab you to eight. Whereas the Saudi will grab you to a. He just looked like. And they keep growing throughout their lifespan, require more and more food with the amount. When the amount of food is unavailable, they die from starvation. And the reason why you don't see a thousand year old crocodiles that are 50 feet long.

Speaker 1:          00:11:02       Wow. That's the only reason. Holy Shit. The way they died of starvation or as if they contracted disease. Oh my God. They just keep growing. So that's why they. That's why these ones in captivity, because they get hand fed. Yeah, probably get the biggest. That's where you'll see your biggest crux. The Guinness Book of World Records, the Saltwater Crocodile Cotton Australia as the largest crocodile in captivity measures 17 feet, 11 point seven, five inches. So basically 18 feet. That's huge. So that my body, my body, Andrew Equals. Have you heard of your ankles? No habit. Oh, he's, he's like a youtube sensation. He's been captured in just about everything in Australia for the last millennium. And um, he's, he's seen a six w made a crocodile before. When he's one of these guys. You don't bullshit. Like if he says he's seen a six meter crocodile, he's seen a six meter crocodile. Yeah. Well that's just the biggest one in captivity.

Speaker 1:          00:11:59       Right? So that's probably, and Australia has a ton of food. Tons of food. Yeah. So it's not like this, this starved to death. This river system. We went down there fishing and we've probably traveled an hour down the river and a little tinny little boat. I reckon we've seen 200 to 250 salt water crocodiles in that time. She's like, because like they can't harvest them or they don't call me out or anything like that. Did. There are laws protecting them so there is as low as protecting them. So that's why the place is just riddled with them at mathematical laws protecting them. It sounds like they're on posted. Well anything that's a night even Australia is protected. So like you guys, you know how you can hunt, you're white tailed deer and everything like that. Australia can't hunt Kangaroos, you can't hunt any native. So everything we hunting is an introduced species and native.

Speaker 1:          00:12:47       So you can't hunt them and there's been talk about bringing in like a program. But I don't know if it will happen but that's, that's so weird. Yeah, it seems to me to be very strange. It's like completely different system. Yeah, but it makes sense that you guys hunt all the non native species because they're invasive and devastate the wild, the land and the other wildlife. Like you guys have crazy problems with feral cats. We talked about that before and you know that you have pigs everywhere and nyman donkeys, horses, even the funny ones that people don't think about like donkeys, wild horses, camels. I think camels probably get a little bit of exposure. Then we'll go to all your typical stuff. You know, pigs, goats, we've got the 60 years bcs. So if we didn't have any of those introduced species, we. There'd be no hunting in Australia.

Speaker 1:          00:13:33       So what but what do they say? That sounds nuts. So they're only hunting just to get rid of the invasive species? That's correct. How do they control the populations of the Kangaroos or you can get like a permit. I couldn't as a bow hunter or just a hunter, couldn't get a permit, but if you're a professional shooter lucky shooting for human consumption or petmate or something like that, or if you're a big land owner, you can get like a tag or permits to shoot Kangaroos then every now and then to be an organized coal because they let them get so far out of control that they, they eat the ground down to just pretty much. Then they lie around and die a slow death of a couple of months because I lose nutrition, you know, they've weakened, they don't move and it's obviously, it's a bit very painful way for to go.

Speaker 1:          00:14:18       Once it gets to that point, it seems like they like, oh, we need to do a column now. So it, all it is, is we've spoken about these people were for the greenies, you know, these people that really don't have a good picture on it and see that uh, Carl or hunting program is actually better welfare for the animals because they stay healthier and in check. Well they, yeah. They don't have any predators. Exactly. Yeah. Some places got wild dogs and Dingos, but that's about it. Yeah. And how many dingoes can take out a kangaroo. Kangaroos get pretty goddamn bad. Yeah, they do. Yeah, they do. They take them out, they try and take down buffalo and stuff. But they are. They really? Yeah. I don't think they very successful. They'd pick off a pig or a pig. Little something like that.

Speaker 2:          00:14:57       Yeah man, you know, it's just, I just don't understand why they would not try to keep the crocodiles and check if you've seen it. Hundreds and hundreds of crocodiles like that because one of those things gonna eat what's going on here. Jamie says in Malaysia, a CROC shut up in front of somebody's shop and they were trying to get rid of it and they apparently don't know how people have held a month ago and while they have helmets and maybe they're going to hit, but it take. The guy's got a gaffe was what is he going to do here? Is trying to throw a tarp on it. So they called Jesus Christ like a bad idea. This is hilarious. They're all wearing Camo. Uh, but why are they wearing red camera? Or it might be the fireman. I think it looks like truck right there. But why the firemen were like, what do they blending into?

Speaker 2:          00:15:40       Let's go right in it. That's a uniform. You think they got their helmets on? Put that helmet. Looks like a motorcycle helmet. A different country captain diversity over here. Jamie Vernon and big data. That's a good size. Big fucker. And he's got his mouth open to like, he's like, bitch, I'll kill you all this gary, I, oh, they're so different. Like I grew up when I was, when I grew up actually, but I lived there for three years. I lived in Gainesville, Florida and when I lived there, alligators were protected. They used to be protected and we used to go to this place called Lake Alice and we would throw marshmallows and the water and the alligators would come up and eat the marshmallows. But then they start snatching people's dogs. I remember this one lady freaked out one snatcher dogs just pull it right off her leash and she freaked out and that started happening more and more. And then the population got denser and denser one point in time they were endangered. Now they're infested. Now there's so many alligators that they. Have you ever seen that show swamp people that show where they go hunting for alligators, which you know, people make purses and shoes and shit out of them. They get 500 tags, $500 so they can chew 500 fucking allocated just to keep the population healthy. And the food is apparently very good. The tail meat is apparently delicious.

Speaker 1:          00:16:58       I think Benny I brought in was just down there somewhere, maybe a month back down there and now like my set of line and hook them and taking a haven meet. Obviously the girl off the skins and things like that.

Speaker 2:          00:17:10       The leather of the skins, the meat is very good. Dudley handsome. He bow haunts him every year. He goes to Orlando outside of Orlando. I'd like to be pretty cool. That'd be pretty cool. Well, they taste good too. And they're in. It's a conservation thing too because it's like you really do need to control their population.

Speaker 1:          00:17:26       Yeah. Australia needs to get to that point. What? What's happening now is they're pushing into domestic waters, you know, like Darwin, the cds, like build around, you know, a big, big river being lit or a big water system and the guys would go swim in there and get taken all the time and I will people's dogs jumping and they get taken. I think I've seen a video, I don't know if it was Darwin

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       or where it was, but um, some lady's filming and then just say the back of a crock go on the luck of jetty and then the, the face of the crop comes out and it's got a full size domestic dog and its jaws. It was imagined saying that how creepy side it was swimming in a river system. Like a, like a, seems like a, like some sort of aqua doctors. Crazy. I big dog today. Just it runs like, you know, everyone talks about big foot. This is the one Jesus look at the color on it. God, that thing is so big, like fluffy. That is a monster. Just a straight up. I mean, what are they like? I think they're more than 30 million years old. Yeah, I think I really, I don't think they've changed in 30 plus million years. I think they just look at everything as potentially food and that's where the risk is and that's the assignment.

Speaker 2:          00:18:46       If it's assigned with a big grizzly bear, you know, they just look at everything as a va danger so they feel frightened and want to attack it or it's food. Have you ever seen Jim shockey's show? You know, that show uncharted that he does? Yep. Have yet jim shockey's uncharted one of them ones. He went to Africa and I think it was the Congo, um, I think it was the Congo River, south of the Congo River, I don't know. Anyway, it was a river and this, a native population that lived there. These villagers, they lived right on the river banks and they were just getting taken left and riper crocodiles. Everyone in the village had like an arm missing or chunk cut out of their head. Is this sit right here? Jim shockey, Mozambique, Mozambique. There we go. Thank you. And Jim shockey's. Just amazing. But these things, look at what they got here.

Speaker 2:          00:19:34       One of them was feasting on some sort of an animal. See, look at these guys. They all have like a, a stump where their arm is and there's Jim and so they wanted to bring in professional hunters to try to help control the population because they were actively targeting the people that live there. And these people, I mean they, they live in a very small, very primitive village and all they have is the water. I mean, that's where they're getting their water from, which it off is about to fucking make the kill shot. Youtube glitch was fucking. Oh, really? Kept flashing. What is that? I needed to refresh it. It was just, it happens on youtube from time to time on, on the computer or normal. Just normal. Yeah, just the browser. But um, it just does the poor people that lived there. I mean, you just got to imagine if this is your only play. These people aren't traveling. They don't have cars. They don't have. They're not flying anywhere. This is where they live. They have to build these sort of fences around these little tiny bays. They build these small makeshift fences to try to protect themselves from the crocodiles when they clean, they clean their food or gather water or wash their clothes once that risk every day. Fuck. This is one of the reasons why I do these radical hunts because it makes you realize how good we've got it, right?

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       Yeah. Like a like we just go to the tap and turn the tap on and we get water or if you want to share her a bath, it's in the comfort of your own house. These people are just trying to get water to drink and they. They could get snatched. Well, people have been snatched. Isn't that ridiculous? And that's their life and there's no other life. They know that their ancestors had been there and their grandparents had been there. Their fathers had been there, their mothers and now them. And this is life. That's why anytime someone complains about Australia or it in theU , s or whatever, it's like, dude, fuck. Go look at what you have got so easy. Isn't it crazy? It's so crazy. I mean, I was watching your instagram feed when you were taking water or this buffalo wallow and throwing it through a filter and put it in.

Speaker 1:          00:21:29       Now when you're a bit concerned about that because I like when I looked into the filter, just even video. Is that on your instagram? It might be still alive on the instagram. It's on normal. So normal instagram normally go to cvs because that way we could see. So to start as I moved probably 200 buffalo off that water hall and like a couple of mobs of pigs that were all like they go and ride out into the water and try and cool off. He has a least one big salt water crocodile in there as well, but I'm walking out there with that bag to you by yourself? Yeah, I'm by myself. Correct. And I'm sleeping in a little cloth house. Yeah. I have a guys back in camp, but I was just down in the hunt, Wyoming so that it just said this was pretty new.

Speaker 1:          00:22:11       I didn't know if it was older. Yeah, I think it's it and yeah. Yeah, yeah. I'm barefoot walking up to the water with this pumps. I'm going look at this. Look at this. Look at. This is a big frigging buffalo to sitting right there in the water that's old for the water. Do not drink and then frigging dehydrate and die out there. But you drink and Turd water. Yeah. That's why I hope the field to work. Now, how do these filters work? How does that. Well, they claim to filter out 99 point nine, nine, nine, nine, nine percent of all the germs. It's zero, zero, zero, zero. One. It's going to fuck you or something on the edge of the bag that runs down, you know, that's probably going to get you. But um, how often do you get beaver fever when you do? I've never been, I've never been sick from drinking water out in the Bush or eating.

Speaker 1:          00:23:04       That's any of the meat or anything like that. Never ever, ever, ever talked to dad, spends time in the bush, gets sick. How have you not gotten anybody? Andrea equals. And He seems like a pretty hardy dude. And he's like, oh, so have you had this? And I'm like, no, have you had this? I'm like, no, have you had this? Like not nearly died from this. I'm like, what? I've had none of those. And I've drank. There was one time I was so desperate for water. This has gone back to when I was like, looks like actually it looks all right. It looks pretty good. Taste off the filter. The water tastes like Piss piss and I'm like, shouldn't have that filter because the taste is obviously something but it's still piss. It's still paced but it's probably actually really good for you. Drinking is good friend with Duke in that water.

Speaker 1:          00:23:52       Do you put like a c? You've got a mountain ops bottle. Do you put some flavor in there? Just to mask it a bit. I think I'd run out at this point that was like 27 kilometer hike that day. Um, so you just deal with the taste. Do you just deal with it and you know what, you're that first either. It doesn't really bother you at the time. Well, when you did that epic hunt up here in cow in, um, we were starting in Colorado. Right. And then you went to Idaho, Idaho, but I didn't actually hunt Idaho across through Idaho into the back of Montana. Yeah. And trying to find a spot with limited hunters and more elk and we were all following you on instagram stories was a tough haunt. Those tapes that I left out of it and unlike, I'll just save this for Joe, but well I got really sick like for like they always just liquid coming out of frigging every you got sick from waters.

Speaker 1:          00:24:46       I don't want to admit that. Hey, you just said you never got because a couple of pit people writing me messages and like that's a good way to get sick. And I'm like I've done these heaps as long as you do. And you drank red on the ground. Oh yeah. I actually, I ate some jerky that had been, I left it in the tank and the tank got really hot. Like the start of the hunt. It was the heat was soaring, you know, and the, the, he wouldn't be sweaty in that in the bag, but I'll stop and so I'm like, I'm just going to eat it. And then it was nearly like two hours later that I was lucky. I don't feel real good about 'em. I've never been tent bound in me life and I'm just like not just keep haunting, don't worry about it.

Speaker 1:          00:25:22       So this is bad. I probably shouldn't say it, but I literally hunt for five minutes and have to pull me straight down, you know, and then go number twos and then walk for another five minutes and be like, Oh fuck, you know, informed my brains out for a couple of days. Two days, two days. I think that's because I lost 17 kilos. I reckon I lost 10 of them in them. Couple of days. What's that in pounds? Seventeen kilos. It's a lot of pounds. Thirty five. Lost that much weight. Yet I had my pants were falling off me dude. Like, like literally falling off me from being taught on the to fallen off me. So this was because you were hiking every day. Just how I can everyday I w I hiked over frowned, remodels, hold up for a hundred and 14 miles. I think it was all up 22 days.

Speaker 1:          00:26:07       That's so crazy. That's limited food and um, you know, maybe that bad jerky helped as well. So I'm going to start a weight loss program or my friend Burke. It did a yoga today. He's obsessed with you. Is going to be on the podcast as well. Kim sent me a link and she's like, you should have, you should listen to this podcast. And I listened to it and he's like, I feel like I could be friends with that dude. And I'm like, yeah, we can be friends. Then he put frigging on Instagram, some dude trying to milk. He's nibbles and we can't be fucking friends, but he's won me back either because he'd done that hilarious video if you dance in the dialogue was crying. Yeah, we did our uh, 13th. He and I did our 13th yoga class today and Ren Tom are on number 14.

Speaker 1:          00:26:56       Two more to go for me. One for logos. Those two guys told at the homestretch, but yeah, nothing compared to 28 days in the bush. It was good. I loved it. I missed a lot of things. Like it makes you realize, you know, like I said how lucky we are off and, and I've always been the person that doesn't take anything for granted anyway, but it's just that, you know, it really rings home, you know, the simple thing. So you just just went out there. Look, you didn't necessarily have a good area that had been scouted out. Definitely didn't have a good area, but um, met a real nice young dude actually messaged me for instagram at the time. I could hardly get to any messages and about. Anyway, that was one that I read and he's like, look, while you're in this unit, he picked what unit is he in?

Speaker 1:          00:27:39       He's like, come over to this area of hunter for pretty much my whole life. And there's a few good bulls there. Now the first day or the second day that I was in there, I was saying three really good bulls and that's what kept me there because I kept thinking I'm going to find them bulls again and I just cleaned off. I just moved out of the area. Um, the whole idea of hunting in Colorado was because last year I had a couple of issues with grizzlies in Montana and doing saw law. I'm lucky you're a, you're a decade if you do that again because you got three young kids and a beautiful wife. Like it's a big risk to take, like I take risks, but that's one that's out of my control. You know, grizzly going. Yeah. Yeah. And so I kept trying to avoid that area and then when I wasn't fun in bulls, like, so I ended up moving out to Colorado, went to Idaho and walked into the back of Montana where there's supposed to be less grizzlies.

Speaker 1:          00:28:27       And that's where I got charged by grizzly bears. A lot of grizzlies and Montana. Man, it's crazy. They're out of control too. They just frigging like the crocs on dry land. You saw grizzlies in Colorado? I did yet. Oh, this is the cutest thing. I've caught so much flack over that. Now you're positive. These were grizzle hundred percent. Now what does a black. There's black bear in the same area and I nearly could do the comparison because it was a black bear there and it was a grizzly day saying the black bear first and I'm like, oh, this in. You'll see the video. Like, oh, there's a black bear over there. That's pretty cool. She's got cubs, so I just want to try and avoid her. Then looking at these Alpha Bayer and all this thing. Grizzlies before this, things that completely different beasts. There's no mistake in the two.

Speaker 1:          00:29:09       It's not like a. that's just the. That's a young looking Greasley that might tell it now. It looks like a big black bear. No, it's a frigging massive grizzly and compare it to a massive black bed. There's still a massive height difference and everything. The big write up shoulders. The big square head spotting scope with you. Now I did not just have maybe been oculus and 10, 40 two's 10 by 42 is the mavens yet. So the same one too. You got a good look at it. Awesome. Look, but at that point I just figured, Oh shit, there is grizzlies in Colorado. Just the couple of people that told me all you won't see grizzlies. They just didn't know the area. Right. So I didn't think much of it. So I did the little film for the buyer knows and stuff like that and like there's a big Mama grizzly up there.

Speaker 1:          00:29:55       She's got carbs. I definitely want to stay away from her. Then I wanted the whole my ass out of that because that's an advice and I wanted the whole mindset of that Bison and not sleeping that base in for the night. So I've moved on pretty quick. Got to the top of the ridge, looked at her again. She was fading along. I'm like cool. Then slept on the other side of the ridge. Then come back through there in the morning, spotted her again in the morning, kept walking out of there. Then I got reception again and then I had a hit with messages. There's not supposed to be an ingredient leads in Colorado. I'm like, fuck, I just, I just blew it off as in, Oh, there is grizzlies here. Shit, these guys got it wrong. Not that it's a massive big deal and that is not supposed to be at all and no one wants to admit that there are there.

Speaker 1:          00:30:38       So this is a no one wants to admit it or is it you were deep into the tree? Yeah, that as well. So there's a multiple sightings in the area. I don't want to say the area because next year I'm going to go back and document it with a decent camera and everything like that to try to get some video of too and get some real good evidence and stuff like that. So I haven't really spoken about a lot since then because I just got pounded with messages going, there's no grizzlies in Colorado, you idiot. What don't you want to tell? Like wildlife biologists or someone that apparently they already know and I don't want to admit it because of the whole protected space. He's act and everything like that. Well, what does that mean though? Why would they want to admit that there's bears there?

Speaker 1:          00:31:19       I think it might be a pain in the ass. I don't know. I don't understand. I, but I'm keen to get to the bottom of it. You know, it's sort of on this Yamaha. I come back in there again and I'm going to try and get some good evidence, but it seems to me that they would want. I mean, I don't understand why they would want to deny the existence, not able to lie, but a lot of people are saying this actually. I think there's a website where it takes in people's sightings and stuff like that and all the sidings and the last grizzlies known in Colorado. We're all in this mountain range. That probably gives a lot of it away. But the San Jose San Jose mountain range. It is. Yeah. But no, it's massive. Like, Oh God, I'm not too worried. All of the last sightings were there and I think the last sightings were in the eighties, maybe the early nineties there was grease Liza, and when you look at a map and you look at the range, it's. It'd be nothing for him to be there. Still was this bought new ones. Walk in there. There's grizzlies in Wyoming, right? Connected. Yep. So of course they're probably there. Why do they think that you get up there and you have a look at this mountain range and as just 100 percent in grizzly country. Oh, that, that one there. I'm the last sighting occurred in 2,600 independent pass officials investigated but found nothing to 1979 bear had cubs are likely dead.

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       That's A. is that a bear right there for that? They got on camera. That's obviously a grizzly. Yeah. You could tell the difference. I saw one in Alberta. I've only seen one if that is a colleague. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:32:50       This thing that I seen towel is over that, like we're talking about a fully mature Mava grizzly.

Speaker 3:          00:32:57       So you're talking about like a 10 foot bear. Yeah, just a huge bear,

Speaker 1:          00:33:00       like there's no mistaking it. This thing would windshields walk and you could see like she's out here like this, you know, like had, when I get big and mature you'll see they've got like a silver back on them, like a grip, like a gorilla, you know, they've got this silver back on him like this, like the last part of the hair goes silver. She's that she's the right color, the right shape, the right size and everything. So

Speaker 3:          00:33:22       hmm. So you only saw her in her cubs or you saw more?

Speaker 1:          00:33:25       Her and her cubs and then Novalon there's a photo of another one that's just the cinnamon black bay are. And I think a lot of few people got confused and that's probably on my end from. I just posted a story about a grizzly and then I had these other best shot

Speaker 3:          00:33:38       static results from 2011. It says actually steamboat springs. Yeah. Okay. That's Colorado. Nearly look at that as a cinnamon phase. Black Bay to go to a be wrong. Go, go. Can you make that larger Jamie? It's as big as it gets. That might be a grizzly. Yeah, it could be, but yeah, you might be right though. That could be a collar phase. Brown bear, black bear rather

Speaker 1:          00:34:03       test looking at. If it's a younger Greasley then maybe not. But she had this frigging massive head dude like flared out like this, you know, the big read on the back and

Speaker 3:          00:34:15       it'd be interesting if Adam Green tree was the one who proved that they're almost dry. A grizzly bear was in Colorado, but the point is there's very few people that are going to the mountain ranges. Like how far back were you from the trail head at? Well, so I've wrote a really rough trail head

Speaker 1:          00:34:31       on a mountain bike for so far. Then that trial pretty much disappeared out to nothing. Then I hiked a full, must've been seven hours because she was like just before sundown. So it would've been a good seven hours in the back then and that's because there was no elk that's going nonstop, you know, and if you watched the video run a lot of it because it was just what I call dead country, you know, there was not, not really good looking hunting country. So you'll see me sort of trotting along most of it. So it was a long way back. There was no human footprints up there. There was nothing like that.

Speaker 3:          00:35:07       Ten miles, 15 miles,

Speaker 1:          00:35:09       probably 60 miles I think it was.

Speaker 3:          00:35:12       So the odds of people going back there on a regular basis are probably pretty slim. Very slim. Yeah. So they probably just don't know. And now that that's one of the issues that apparently they're dealing with NBC, you know, in bc when you talk to the people that live there versus the people that are. You know how BC has banned grizzly hunting. Yeah. The people that live in Greece, BC are terrified of that now because they're like, we to control these goddamn things. Like you don't like what they say. The people that I know that live up there, they say the wildlife biologists are rarely here like they need and the hunters that people that live up there, the outfitters, it's like you need to take like some sort of a census from us. Boots on the ground ground. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, and the way they describe it as like there was a greedy bowman did a podcast about this with one of the guys that lives up there, that's an outfitter, and he was saying we encountered them all the time and they're hyper aggressive like you, you're talking about people. These biologists that are rarely there. There's not like any like really involved intricate census that they're doing with their go really in depth accounting of all the bears. He's like, you got to get information from the people that lived there and do. They're going to tell you there's a lot of them.

Speaker 1:          00:36:24       Yup. Yup. Well, they're not smart enough to control their sales are because a lot of these people just want to sit back and just let these animals do.

Speaker 3:          00:36:31       Will do. That's the idea. They want to do NBC. They think that what they can do is, I mean this is speculation, but they think that what they can do is let the, instead of let the people control the predators, they think let the predators eat all the game that they can and then when they don't have enough food to, populations are naturally going to diminish.

Speaker 1:          00:36:55       Yeah, no, I like the idea that ain't gonna work. What can happen,

Speaker 3:          00:36:59       but it could take 50, 60 years and the problem is along that you're gonna get a lot of human death, going to get a lot of pets. You're gonna get a lot of animals that are going to invade into farmlands. It just seems to me that that's not a wise way to handle it. No, definitely not. And it's also they're going to have to pay money to kill problem bears and instead of making money, but they don't like. Look, this whole Cecil, the lion thing, I think fucked a lot of people up. You know, people. The idea of some evil person just going over there and shooting some beloved animal. That became the narrative and everybody sort of has this idea in their head that this is what bear hunting is. It's the same sort of thing. We don't want that MPC. No, it's, it's, it really is something that needs to be discussed on both sides and I think both sides have points when it comes to like quote unquote trophy hunting, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:37:49       Yeah, yeah. I'm definitely not for one or the other. It's not like we want to walk them off the face of the planet. We just want to see these healthy, a healthy population

Speaker 3:          00:37:57       and the people that live around there and a lot of them depend on moose meat and deer meat and these bear going to decimate the populations. If they don't control the populations of bear, they will.

Speaker 1:          00:38:07       Something else has got to change. They're going to decimate the game populations. Yeah, sure. I don't, I don't. I actually think the areas that I hunt in Montana aren't overpopulated with grizzlies, from what I've seen just populated. They just populated. So this, the, the place that I ended up going into in Montana isn't my usual spot, you know, and there wasn't supposed to be as many grizzlies and that was, you would have seen the video where I walk over the rise and then all of a sudden we locked eyes at the same time and then she in a split second, she just comes straight at me and I'll tell the story because he hates the people keep asking. But I'm uh, I'm one of these people that I practice with whatever I'm shooting with memory. When the, uh, the free day leafy suits came out, it was a, like a camouflage suit and it had like free tea leaves on it hanging off it.

Speaker 1:          00:38:57       And I like I got laughed at because I went to the archery range and shot in it. And the first time I shot in the string of the boat, hit the leaves in my shirt was off. So yeah, Ghillie suit, like just practice with whatever they use. And so my buddies, a sheriff in Idaho, he's gonna lend me a hand gun. So he lends me to hang on. Like dude, I've never even tried to hang out and you just can't get them in Australia like that, so I want to practice. We went out and practiced and we practiced with a cheaper bullet, you know, and it was like a solid solid bullet. It was awesome. I picked it up straight away and there was no dramas. I was a good shot with it. Just trying to do a rashad thinking if a bear of a Getcha it's going to be in a rush.

Speaker 1:          00:39:39       It's not like these, you know, pull it, pull the gun out and have a heap of time. So I was practicing shooting with one hand and everything like that. Anyway, when it comes to going on the hunt, he gave me some expense, pensive bullets, and now our hollow point with like a real flat front on it. So we never shot those bullets. Anyway, this grizzly charged, I pulled the gun out, she stopped at 20 meters the first time. Like I just try, I stayed stationary, I didn't want to do any radical movements, but I just yelled at her. She stopped at $20,000,000. She turned back and went to a cub and at this point I cubs just at the base of the tree. She got there as soon as she's saying that the cop was all right. She just comes straight back at me again, like, like massive bear, like rice and strike that made.

Speaker 1:          00:40:21       I had the handgun to the handguns out now because I pulled it out the first time. This time she come all the way to 10 meters and I, and I'll actually, I laid this out just for now, just tell it how it went. And I pulled the gun out. I yelled at her again like that. She stopped, she did a big swipe on the ground, spun and went straight back to the login. See soon as she got back to the cob, this time she rented a side load, tried to flank me. You know, it freaks me out how fast these things can move. Like, like you've seen our foster dad can get off the mark I and agrees leads faster than the D or. And you think of the size of a grizzly and it can still move at the speed of a deer or faster.

Speaker 1:          00:40:59       Like in. She just disappears into this. There's all this scrub beside me I can't see. So I'm like standing there like, like just white and where's she going to pop out? Because I fought the third time she's going to, she ain't fucking around. She's going to try and kill me the third time she never showed up and I stayed there for a little while and just start backing up. And that's what I've got the camera out because the other thing I'm fearful of is shooting one and not being able to justify it because you people go to jail, get massive fall. And so I'm like, all want a document? They started telling that she's coming album probably gonna pull the trigger. I want to document it anyway. I back out. She sort stalks along a little bit like watching me and stuff like that. Then she disappears and I walk away and then I realized the guns jammed.

Speaker 1:          00:41:44       The gun's been in that whole time and I was like, let's say shit. So she did come for me, like truly come from me. I was fucked like there was no doubt about what was going on in those hollow points with the flat face and I'm wouldn't load up into the chamber of the gun. They hit on the throat of the revolver and won't go up in there. So you'd never would have gotten off a shot. I would never would have gotten off a shot. And then I was thinking when the time that she to 10 meters, because I thought she was going to jump me it when she come that time and I was like, fuck, I'm surprised the gun didn't go off because I'm sure I had the finger on the trigger. Like I just remember thinking white and it happened that fast that I reckon that second time she come at me when she was about the 12 or 11 made them.

Speaker 1:          00:42:25       Or even when she just come past the original mark that she stopped at 20 meters. I reckon I pulled the trigger and it didn't go off and I kept thinking like there's a slide lock on the gun and I kept thinking that was jammed up and it wasn't at all. Those bullets just didn't fit in that gun fit in there. So you never practiced with them at all. So he entire time you were unarmed yet tire time. I was unarmed. I bought, I bought bear spray from Cabela's. This man, it was like the world was fucking out to get me a bought bear spray from Cabela's and it's on the audit and the light. He didn't put in the bag and I got up there and unpack the bags on luck. Where's the bear spray? Fuck. I don't even know the bear spray might. So I was able to.

Speaker 1:          00:43:04       When she was all me, if I even had this chance, I was ever going to pull an arrow out of the ball and just try and stab her or auto or do you lie dead and cop it or what they say with a female grizzly just try to lay dead because they're just trying to eliminate a threat to the cubs. I feel like it'd be really hard to lie. Did when something scratching your heart, I feel like just the instinct to try and go back at it, you know, they're so goddamn powerful. So that happened and then I'm like, you know what? Like I've got to hike out of there anyway, I'm unarmed so I've got to hike out of there. I've got to get bullets from somewhere. A Muslim guy back to the fucking bad grizzly spot, you know? Which at least I know there's elk there, but I've been trying to not do it.

Speaker 1:          00:43:43       You know? What caliber gun is this point? 40th five. Okay. So it's a good gun. Yeah. But the drama started way before then because I'm like, if I'm going to do these hung, I want to have someone with me like a hunting buddy. I'm not going to do that one solo anymore because of the grids, because of the grizzlies. And so I invited Shane Dorian here, Buddy Shane. He was common and then the tags in Montana got really hard to get so he couldn't get a tag. Then I was going to have drama, film the hunt, but I found that like couldn't film in a wilderness area so they couldn't be there and I'm just like, I'm just destined to go there by myself. And it was like I already knew some shit was going to go down, you know? It was like everything kept pushing me in that direction.

Speaker 1:          00:44:23       Now I go back to Montana. You'll be right. You know you're going to encounter grizzly. That's it. So put this thing in front of your face. Don't put it by your neck. There you go. Hello. Much better. I think I might've been like this when I started the show and now I've just come back and you freaking out. That's what's going on. I think I'm trying to get told because I'm talking about grizzlies and getting goosebumps. Just hearing you talk. I'm getting her. Um, I watched the video probably a week ago and it was just not ever attack or anything. It was just have a big grizzly and I had all them feelings rush back to me. Like it was like I had a full adrenaline rush and everything dude, like the, my body was for pumping and I, until the point I was starting to feel uncomfortable and like, fucking what's going on. I'm like, fuck. I just, it was just that grizzly video and thinking about that grizzly running at me, I could see her as clear as die still coming at me. I remember saying a shoulder's moving dude, as she was just racing. I can just remember seeing a shoulders like pulse site and like in all of her hair moving and.

Speaker 3:          00:45:26       Oh fuck that. Yeah. Did you um, Rinella just released a podcast? Two podcasts in a row? They got charged by a big male grizzly and Kodiak. They'd killed an elk. Non Kodiak. A fog neck.

Speaker 1:          00:45:41       Yeah. Which is why saying grammy's videos. So yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:45:44       they um, they, they just did a podcast on to podcasts in a row and they shot an elk and the fog neck islands, they have roosevelt elk, which is a very large elk and deer. The biggest roosevelt elk is a huge animal, like 1400 pound animal and it's crazy thick brush and they're packing this thing out. Took forever. Right. So they shot it when they left some of it there, they went back to go get the, the elk and Grizzly bear had obviously claimed they didn't know they were hanging around eating sandwiches. They didn't have their guns out. Nothing in the bear just came running in. Just charged into all of them. I'm one of the guys a dartmouth wound up riding on the back of the bear is a fucking crazy story and they're talking about it. Just a giant bear,

Speaker 1:          00:46:32       10, 11 foot grizzly bear this, you know, when people like, Oh, do you believe in big foot or. And stuff like that. We don't fucking have to. There's a real live monster, but we just used to say it. We call it a grizzly bear. It fucking can eat. You owe it, eats everything. It eats everything. They just savage

Speaker 3:          00:46:50       do so big. I don't think people understand how big they are. I haven't seen a big one in the US in the wild, but I saw a small one in Alberta in the wild and it scared the shit out of me.

Speaker 1:          00:47:02       Oh, the one that was on my mile carcass last year and we spoke about it in last year's podcasts. I remember thinking it's faith is bigger than my whole torso do and I'm just like that. Like that should be mythical, but it's fucking not living here right now. And there's states that are protecting them. Like Holy Shit. Yeah. They want to control the. They want to help the populations grow. I think vote would change

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       really quickly about protecting them. Even felt fucking night. You dog will one of your kids or trying to date you. I think people, it would be very hard to get people to vote if it killed a dog because people go, well, you know they were here first. It's when they start getting into you. Our friends up in Alberta, John and Jen Rivet, they sent me some pictures recently of some bears that had moved into the area because they've been pushed out of their good area by grizzlies, right? Yeah. There's a lot of grizzlies grizzlies up there and apparently the talking about having some sort of a season on them because people are encountering them on a more frequent basis, but again, that area where they live up in Alberta is just so dense and it's so dense that trying to figure out how many bears are there, where the bears are, so that's a good system.

Speaker 2:          00:48:17       When I put that time and effort in the fine and the numbers like this, why the American system is the best hunting system I've ever come across because we saw you doing numbers check and then you release the tags for what can be taken out of the population to keep the population healthy. Student. It's all done by wildlife is a hyper revenue there. It's an awesome system. Well billions of dollars a year from hunting revenue in this country that go to wildlife preservation that go to a conservation of habitat. You know, back country hunters and anglers has a great website where all this stuff is detailed. Making Rocky Mountain Health Federation does a same similar thing. It's just they have decreased the detailed numbers on how much money goes into conserving these areas and even repopulating these animals into other areas. Yeah, yeah. It's a brilliant system so it, you know, and.

Speaker 2:          00:49:08       But it has to be that two sides because you can't go fully one while fully the Avo because if it goes fully one way and we've tried frigging wipe amount, no one wants that. So there's got to be that middle ground there where I think what wayside of the greenies fought for as well, you know, and then it's like, well we know we can afford the shoot 200 of those grizzly bears out of the 10,000 that live there or whatever it is, crazy numbers. Then that's the system we want. So it's healthy populations or game every, every single year for generations to come. Healthy populations of game and making sure that these giant predators don't encroach on civilization. Yeah, that's the thing. It's like keeping them out. Once they start wiping out all the moose and all the deer and all the elk, they're gonna move towards people like people need to understand that this is not a game. You don't encounter them in Santa Monica. Right? Yeah. So people like, you know, you asshole was just going to kill the animals. That's not, that's not what these people are doing. You don't understand you. Not Exactly. Yeah. Like you could tell them maybe if they maybe they've heard you like be around them and understand what the fuck this is. Giant 1500 pound monster. That doesn't think like, Oh that dude that I'm going to eight might have kids.

Speaker 2:          00:50:22       They just thinking food hall in me stomach and don't want to fill up. The greenies would say,

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       well that elk, you killed those kids to math. Why these greenies out? They're petitioning against fucking lions killing shit. Why aren't they? Yeah. Right. Why aren't low like lines are killing shit. We were just talking about just part of the food chain as well. Do we are part of this whole system.

Speaker 3:          00:50:44       Courtney do alter on the podcast. I was talking to her about, you know, people occasionally when they're running these trails. We running the mountain lions. We were talking about this lady who lives in Malibu, has an Alpaca farm, a mountain lion, got Intel, Pacos killed 11 of them and a goat just wiped them out. Just fucking decimated the PO. That was fruit killing. And so this lady got a depredation permit to kill them out and she got all these death threats from people. Yeah. Right. But it's always like, do you understand that this now mine, it's killing animals too.

Speaker 1:          00:51:13       Two. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Way more animals. I can understand it.

Speaker 3:          00:51:18       Well, it's not logical. It's just emotional and I think a big part of the problem with two, there's two, two parts of the problem. One, lack of real wilderness exposure, like real time in the woods, understanding what this whole ecosystem is really all about because it's just a Predator prey ecosystem. And when a hunter goes into that, you really just dipping your toes into the wild world a little bit. Yeah, exactly. Then the other part of it is movies, all these fucking bear movies where the bears are your friends, they talk to each other and all these anthropomorphized anthropomorphization movies, whether it's Bambi or whether it.

Speaker 1:          00:51:57       Whereas if you go out into the woods and see yourself, you know, it's a much better understanding and a much better experience for the more people get exposed to these movies with bears talk and they're your buddy. Then get exposed to an actual charge. Fucking Mama grizzly bear like you did. Yeah. Yeah. It's crazy. He wants to kill those payments. A wipe. I didn't look at that mother grizzly and be like, I want to shoot you. If you look at the video, you'll actually hear me gone. I really don't want to shoot this bear like she's just doing what her instinct tells her. Yeah. I'm not even cranky Adot, but I don't want to fucking die, so it's a terrible way to die too. That'd be a horrible way to die. A jaw. The size of this table closing down on you wouldn't be good. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:52:43       Well, they're going to open up a season apparently on them near near yellowstone to many situations. Yup. Bears. Yeah. That's roughly the area that on the air and that's where they released a lot of the problem bears too. That's what I do. Yeah. So I went to an area that they didn't release problem. There's no. Because I'd never say a female grizzly where I usually hunt in Montana. They were old miles or loan animals at least. And I can't tell. And the males are less likely to charge. Well, it seems like it. Yeah, it seems like the males. Well if a male charged you is to eat you? Yeah. Because you know, yelled at that one on my car last year and he wanted to go to the apple. Why he, he ran off and frequent disappeared. And it's interesting because Montana does not have a bear season, so these are not animals like Alaska bears. Avoid people like the play. Exactly. Yep. Yep. Because they're afraid of being shot. Yeah. So he like ran off. I think I only yelled at oil to him that one last year and he disappeared. This female grizzly that was running it. I mean I was calling her a fucking mall and everything might shake a mall. What's the mall? I knew that was an Australian word.

Speaker 1:          00:53:49       So me and my buddy Andrew Boucles, who I've just spent last week with him in Arnhem land in northern territory. He come, you'd just be sitting in the vehicle driving along and it's all quiet and peaceful and then he would just come up with something weird like, you know, if, if you had to bring any active back from the dead to hunt with you for a week, who would have been fuck honeys and trying to think about that. But um, then I can't have one because I'm like, he's coming up with all this shit. I'm going to call it one of them over this trip. We just need to come up with real Australian things, sayings that aren't getting used anymore. And mine was like, Tyler, like, do you have that one? Like if you say bye or someone instead of saying by just say Tyler, I'm fucking get blank stares.

Speaker 1:          00:54:33       Like a magician would say 10. Ah, it's like tyler, like as in. See you later. No, Tata for now. What about her? I know. All right, bye. No. Oh fuck her. Raise like victory. Okay. Well Mall is like I'm calling someone a bitch or a skank. A mall. You've got skank? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. So she's running at me. I'm like fucking ease up your fucking mall, you know. And she's like, fuck, is this guy from? It's probably why she didn't eat. She was from here. She didn't even say this, but I imagine she was thinking, I don't speak English. He doesn't even know what a dummy reach it. No, I've never heard of a mold before. A mall, like a mall of America. M O l e like molly. I get. Yeah, but I think it's more of like mall in your face. I, he's, he's brought all ll slang.

Speaker 1:          00:55:29       Slang, term two different Australia, Australia, New Zealand. Oh, in the United States. Usually a pejorative or self deprecating for a woman of loose sexual morals. Shit, bitch. I said big slot or a prostitute. Damn, no wonder she was pissed off. Wow. Mall Mall. That's probably like some old shit from America that we like. We gave to you long time ago. We abandoned it. Then you guys picked it up probably probably so when you went and got boats, she went and got bullets for the Fed and I went and bought bullets. Jump Straight back into Montana but me old spot in Montana. And then um, I only had three days at that point to try and cause, you know, it was after a bull elk and I'd passed up a lot of younger animals and like immature animals over that time. But um, I went from the hot heat to got to my usual spot in Montana. And why out that was. No.

Speaker 3:          00:56:25       Explain that for people that aren't hunters is. It is very important. If you want to consider the overall health of the herd, you always want to shoot the older mature animals because those are the ones that are bred. They've passed on their genetics and it also improves the health of the herd because then the younger males. That's right. I would probably get killed by the bigger males or have the potential getting killed in combat when they clashed. And that's the whole reason. If people don't know why they have antlers

Speaker 1:          00:56:51       finding it. Yeah, exactly. Yep. I think my, my biggest thought in that is I just want to shoot an animal that's lived its life. Like, look, if I'm desperate for me, don't get me wrong, I'll shoot a spike or a cow or whatever, but I'm not desperate for meat. And that point of survival, you know, so I just feel a lot better if I shoot an animal that unlike it's lived its life, you know. And then the byproduct of that is you get a bigger animal, so more meat, you know, you get a set of antlers, which is to me a memory. It's not like about, I don't cut the head off and just walk out at the end. I was like, I've got a trophy. And I think a lot of people think that for me it's a yf respect, but it's just, it's a way of respecting the animal to me, you know, so it's, it's a funny thing.

Speaker 1:          00:57:36       But yeah, just shooting a big old, you know, and that's why I passed a lot of lot of young animals. I had opportunities that was one dials rod on the edge of this, like, like it's like a cliff. But there was a rock that went out over the cliff, like a bit of a pinnacle and I was actually on the pinnacle and I had this bowl strike below me and he was like, I think he was, he was 30 something made his butt because you're shooting down. It's like, you know, the range finders science you to that 16 or 17 meters. And he was just lying there, had no idea it was there. Um, but just a younger bull, you can see it in his face and his body and just these analysts. So. But it felt good to be there and then be like, Nah. And back out. And then it was afternoon. I think that that Greasley went me, so you know, I had opportunities to shoot balls, but I pretty much went 21 days without an opportunity where I'm like, this is the bullet I'm going to shoot, you know, and I'm getting into the zone, have this. The thing that people I think

Speaker 3:          00:58:30       on the outside don't understand or appreciate is that it's not just about getting me, it's also about getting a mature animal and it's also about getting a mature animal because they're way more different.

Speaker 1:          00:58:43       Exactly, yeah. They are way smarter and Bain for seasons, you know, they just heaps more switched on. You know, there are a lot smarter. So you wanna let's like going into a fight. Like you don't want to go into a fight with someone that's never done kickboxing and yoga champion kickboxer. So like that's ridiculous. Like where's the challenge in that? How are you going to be better at doing what you're doing? If you're just fighting the fight that you know you're always going to win. And then I say it very early in that trip. I'm happy to go home without a ball, but I'm not happy to give up on day three or four or sit around camp and then go home available. I want to bust my ass, you know, I want to get to point where I say to myself, and I did it multiple times on this trip, what the fuck are you doing?

Speaker 1:          00:59:26       Like give up. This is too hard, you know, I want to get to that point where myself write down because I feel like that's the most you ever grow, you know, in any sort of hardship. But you know, it's like freaking campaigns running this. Like, you know, he's guest going to find a longer marathon next time. Well that's what courtney was saying, that they're considering a 500 holly block run 500. I can't even fathom that dude. Yeah, I mean how many days would that take? I don't know. I can't even fathom going counting days. It's probably like a week. It's probably going to be a week of running. Yeah. So it's just, you always up in it, you know, like I'll go to, I got to pull back a little bit now. Like I don't like that's about the maximum that all do. Twenty to 22. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:00:12       And then. But it was a lot longer without the family because you know, the flights here and the flights back. And I went, I was with Yeti and I went, well I did the whole Yeti thing and went to the innovation center and hung out with Yeti for like a couple of days. Me and Bendigo. Brian went down to west Texas hundred some axis D, um, I went bass fishing. So there was like, there was like a week and a half on that trip that probably a lot of people didn't realize that I'm without my kids and family, you know, that's the hard bit. I could go and live out there like a frigging hermit. But I've got family and I freaking love them and miss him. Dude. You know what I mean? I'm saying the and like, you fuck this for me because I'm sitting on the mountain like, you know, this is all me, my element up there, like it's out in the middle of nowhere.

Speaker 1:          01:00:58       There's no people, there's no lights, you know, there's just wild animals running around and I'm sitting on the mountain. I'm like, fuck, I'm Ms Dot Kim. But don't you think that that's one of the reasons why you appreciate them even more than your family? So much as it is. But yeah, I, you know, I said once to Steve Rinella. We did this crazy hunt and Prince of Wales and it rained every day and it was just, we were just drenched where you're inside your tent and the tent, like I turned on my headlamp and there was just water vapor everywhere in the tent, like nothing ever dried out, sleeping bags wet, you're miserable. But when I got home, I called him up and I said, man, I have never felt good. I'm so happy the sun is out and I'm driving and I just feel amazing. I feel like I'm on a drug and I called him up and I go, dude, I have never been happier.

Speaker 1:          01:01:46       Crazy. I miserable. It is. Yeah. The better, you know, and they have to experience some difficulty in some hardship in order to appreciate the good times. Yeah, yeah, exactly. I've, I feel like frequent with Kim. It's like we're new newlywed till the time and it's probably because I'm away so much, but every time I come home, you know, overcome a while. I'm thinking about him flat out, you know, I actually just renewed my vows with Kim 15, 15 years, 15 years, married, 18 years together. Yeah. I think that there's something to that man. I mean, people, you know, absence makes the heart grow fonder. It's a common expression. I think it's totally true and I think that I, I don't think life is supposed to be easy. I just did not. I think you're supposed to do some difficult cit, but on, I think the sooner you realize that then it does seem easy to you.

Speaker 1:          01:02:35       Does that make sense? It's like the sooner you realize that life's supposed to be fucking tough and if it's not, put yourself through some tough shit, then the better dude then it just, it it. Right now I feel like I've found the recipe just to be happy as hell. I've been silent. The last frequent mom fly. I don't want this to happen, but I've been signed to Kim and she sort of gets teed up fucking just no, I'm happy to die right now. Logging. I really may not. I'm happy to fucking die right now. I want to see my kids grow and I want to say my kids have kids and I want to spend the attorney with eternity with that woman but on fucking happy to die right now and that happy. And why do you see? Why do you think like that? Because I feel like I've just lived through our law for already and I'll put you still enjoy it.

Speaker 1:          01:03:17       Every good. I still enjoy and be happy to die because I'm fucking crazy. Probably. I ain't doin anything out of the ordinary to fucking die. But you talk a little bit, but that's fucked up. That shit the fuck out. That's probably not good. But Jesus Christ. Did you get back until that dude who gave you the 45? Hey, fuck face. Yeah. Yeah. He was freaking. They're the nicest people. It was kay and Ed that were in Oregon. Yeah. They're the nicest people. And I think aid was freaking more than me. I'm like, it's all good. But uh, yeah. Fuck you to know that you had the good, you had it out and there was nothing they wouldn't. Yeah. Woo. And then so I had to sleep there that night because I wasn't walking out in the dark. And the worst thing is I'm sleeping on the, at the elevation that she's at and cheese.

Speaker 1:          01:04:10       I only about 400 meters in a direct line from my camp. Oh Jesus Christ is. So. Did you sleep well? So I manually put a shell in the chamber side one shell and I just fucking. I actually slept really good that not, I don't know if it was adrenaline wore were and often it wore me out more. Were you convinced that it was going to fire even with that one shell in the chamber? I would have because I couldn't have the magazine in there because it would jam on the bullet, but I could drop a shell in there manually and that'd be good to go. I had one bullet. Yeah. Russian roulette with no fucking good. I can add me. No, I found that night as well. Like sleeping with me. Does your knife not fuck God, she's probably thinking it's a mosquito. Notice a fucking thick.

Speaker 1:          01:05:00       Their skin is so thick because they bite each other. Yeah. Go Watch that. A grizzly man documentary, one of the craziest things was watching the two grizzlies fight. They were just tearing each other apart, bite each other's heads, and when it was over he didn't look like anything. Tore us to shreds body. That's had really good experience in northwest territories. You know, there's black and grizzlies living in the same area. He's experienced the two fighting and has never liked the black bag bear grizzly. It's always the grizzly running down the black bay. He said one swat from a grizzly bear, you know, a bigger blackberries once from a grizzly bear and the black bear might be dead, but it's fucking disabled mate. One Swipe. So imagine what one swipe from agrees grizzly would do to us. You

Speaker 2:          01:05:44       know, there's a picture of campaigns and a grizzly that he shot in Alaska and he's holding up. It's Paul. It's the to bear that he shot was like 11 feet tall and he's holding up. It's Paul and the PA is like a fucking dinner plates. Gary. It's like this big, maybe bigger than it didn't imagine that bitch slap followed by clothes. Dude is dry doctorate yet. Look at the size of that thing. Fuck the pole. A look at the tape on that blog. Blogs. Yeah. Oh No, not again. Damn. Your cams. White teeth. Want them? You could just get that charcoal.

Speaker 2:          01:06:28       Do you drink coffee? Yeah, I do. I wonder if too though. He drinks coffee. Yeah. But coffee month had bleach in it and are fucking enormous. Enormous roles. But like you said, I mean that really is a real live living monster. Crazy. I love that. Dude. They, I'm just having a joke. He's a fucking legend. He's the best. Yeah. But um, I mean, he know John Dudley saw a grizzly bear take out a moose with one swipe. He saw it through a spotting scope. He saw a grizzly bear hit a moose in the back and break it. Spriker and spawn date. Just they hit sign. They'll probably one of the few animals that like hits. Yes. I wonder what chance have we got? You might zero. You're a bit mad. Fuck. Come on, man. Breaks the back of. This is Kate my scollon. Yeah. They're just so big. They're so goddamned big frigging living. Bigfoot dude right there. Yeah. Big. It's only like eight foot tall monkey. They probably fucking what? Big Foot. They probably fucked bigfoot Tamala death.

Speaker 2:          01:07:37       This fucking where we'll fucking this gorilla. Well, what's crazy is that. That's a small bear. Compare it to the short face. Bear was short nose bear. What was it? What was that bear that lived in the. I seen the face bear. They think they call it, which is bigger even than a polar bear. Kodiak bear. There's a picture of these guys standing next to a um, yeah, that's it. That's the Holy Shit. That's scary. And that thing had long legs and that thing apparently was so fast and so ferocious that it kept people from crossing the bering land bridge. Uh, that's one of the reasons why they think that people, it took so long for human beings to make it to North America. It's Paul as big as that dude chess. They're the bigger dude that is. Look how much bigger there than anything else. There's a grizzly polar, and then the powers of big data analytics, thinkful I think 10,000 years.

Speaker 2:          01:08:35       I think that was the final. If that's the case, Jamie, find out why. But there's a picture of a seven facts about the extinct giant bear hug. Eleven thousand years. Go back to that last page. You are pleased and look at that one image. It's really a guy up in the right hand corner. The guy touching the face. Oh yeah, that's what God damn it. I mean, that is a monster. That's a monster from Avatar or from star wars and that's a real animal that lived alongside people for a long ass time, but see what I mean. If they would just run her in the wallet still, we just have a normal name for them and it wouldn't be any different cause exactly. Seen Him, dude. It's like the galaxy, like you're used to looking at it, say the Milky Way. So it's like, oh cool, fuck off.

Speaker 2:          01:09:26       Had that. Think about that. Yeah, that is freaky dude. Oh yeah. I've always said that if space wasn't real, like if there was a roof over the world, but there was one place where you could go, you could see space. Everybody would want to take a trip to that by a 100 percent. Yeah. For all of us to look at it. You just got to get away from some of these shitty law where you have some amazing pictures, man. Image. Go to first. Is it first image on instagram? Adam is not just an amazing bowhunter, but an amazing photographer just added one that I. because when you're out there and honestly and like there's no artificial, there's no light pollution for a long, long way. So if you look closely at that Phsi, the, the orange lights, the fire. But see the clouds in the background, there's a fun just a campfire that week.

Speaker 2:          01:10:16       But if you look behind that, that's lightning in clouds. So I ended up getting the far the lightning and in the milky way blazing and for the, that is an amazing picture. That is amazing, isn't it? I'm just a dude. I can't like I'm there and I don't go to sleep til one or 2:00 in the morning cause I'm just lying there looking up. We'll take photos and I'm just like, what the out there. Like how crazy is that? That picture is incredible. That's beautiful. So that's over our heads every night. That's another thing that you just sort of take for granted, you know? Yeah. And like you said, the light pollution. I mean we just, we love cities. They're nice, they give you, you know, supermarkets and restaurants and shit, but they also ruin your view of the universe. Totally. It's not worth it. Not Worth the trade off is almost not worth it. Just don't fucking pigs now because with so you know, there's so many options out there and food, I reckon our taste buds have changed and everything.

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       Gold, no doubt. Our taste buds have changed for sure because it's stuffed back then. Wouldn't be bland. But what if you just ate those real simple items now it'd be blamed as hell, you know, I need source on, I need to put sold aren't need to do this and you're not. And then yeah, just feel like with turn and then the frigging pigs because there's so many options for food out there that were just keep shoveling and we'd just take it all for granted as well. One hundred percent. But I like it. I like dinner after this we're going to go to a restaurant. Sit down. Yeah, exactly. Not. Think about it and we'll have good is that when I come back from this 22 days, $2 fantasize and over foods, I put the 17 kilos straight back on. What were you thinking of? Just fucking anything.

Speaker 1:          01:11:59       It was proposed at one. Is there one thing you like? As soon as I had burger burger, but like a full work burger, like a jerk burger that's just packed and there's a couple of places that mean came usually got home and I was just dawn, like I'm about to salivate. So like both the time spent away and the time and civilization. That's the thing is achieving balance. Yeah. It gets getting the balance. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Because the civilization is awesome. It's great to be able to go to a doctor. Yeah. And when you get away from all that and you are out in the walls, they, that's huge. Fully realized like fuck, how good do we have it? Like you hop in a car with air conditioning, you drive from point a to point b, like you know, and I always think about how life must have been back in the day.

Speaker 1:          01:12:45       Like it wasn't driving from point a to point b because I had have taken fucking a week dude. Now you just jumped in the car and go. It's all temperature controlled. You stop at a service station, you get fuel, fucking I'm thirsty. I'm going to get a drink while I'm in there. You know, like that's just one, one example of how crazy it is. Yeah. Now when you are in the Bush, when you, especially when you're an art land, you find a lot of pictographs and a lot of these. Yeah. Because there was such a huge indigenous population up there. Well there still is, but you know, you're looking at. I put one up the other day, it's a video, it's just Indians. The stories that Jamie might find it, but a main equals or looking at some paintings and then I looked down and like there's a whole human remains tucked in the rocks.

Speaker 1:          01:13:30       They're ripe wrapped in pipe. A box which is a jet pilot back in America. Chocolatory I don't think so. Cool. A pipe voc because it's like the, the box literally rips off at like a soft tissue paper. And uh, so some mobs, like indigenous people would rather do the indigenous people call like a group of them. Well you drive here. You were talking a mob of hogs earlier, you said that mobs, a group of indigenous youth, that's what they call themselves, right? Yeah, that's correct. Yep. Yeah. So I don't like the term like tribe or anything like that because that's very American Indians and things like that. So they would say like what they hear. I wanted to really get into this because this is some stuff we talked about at my house. That's your podcast last time. Oh Wow. Look at those pictures. That's amazing.

Speaker 1:          01:14:14       Yeah. So they real beautiful rights and now a very, I don't know if I'd call them artistic because this just seemed to be what they did, you know, wherever it's that dream time, you would've heard about their dream time. So wherever it's recording their dream time, you know, um, the indigenous would do these, these rock arts and uh, sometimes I'd be carving. So if you go to like the Dapi damp, but Lego in Western Australia, which is in the Pilbara region that are all carvings in rock, like literally scribed in the Rock and um, the day title that you'd get, like, it's so hard describing a rock that get this detail in this rock that was just amazing. They use a pioneer with. I'd grown up different stones and get different textures and colors and see those hand prints. Those hand prints have been put up.

Speaker 1:          01:15:01       Their hands go on the wall and then they spray it out of their mouth. So they might like. And essentially it's like a spray painting, you know, but they're using their mouth. Those other ones would be painted on and you see some really crazy things. Like, I reckon that's an aim. You that white thing, if you have a good look at it, there's so many paintings on there that's a picture that I took a couple of years ago now. But there's so many paintings on there now that you have to stare at it for a wall and then pick a different one. Now you know, and like there's a documented so these ones aren't, so I'm one of about two white fellows that have been to this area and a traditional able to took a say like a traditional loan. I took us up there, she couldn't go up there and 90 raising we were allowed in, there was because this mob of people that they don't exist anymore, the last of them has passed away so it was okay to go in there.

Speaker 1:          01:15:48       So I'm to take you into the full story with like beaten down this Bush track for hours and hours and we pull up at a little creek system and she just sort of pointed that out. She said, look, if you know, if you go up to the escarpment air and into a cave or whatever, you'll see, you know, the, the artifacts and everything that's out there and this. So this is untouched. Like crazily untouch this spot, you know, go in there and it's like a frigging lost city, but all natural, like rocks just pushed up out of the ground. And then you say the mouth of the cave and a couple of paintings on it. Then you walk into the cave and this cave is 60, 70 meters long. It's probably 30 percent or 30 meters wide. And the roofs probably, let's say 10 meters tall and the hallway for this cave systems, those paintings, like he can't ever had, they even reached the top of the cave.

Speaker 1:          01:16:39       Like there's no big rocks or anything sitting around anymore. They still the grinding stones there, Joe, where they'll grinding up the different paints, you know, because that's what they'd do. They'd, they'd grind it up and work it into a paste to paint with. That's all still sitting there. And there's 30 human reminds just sitting in the cave in a, like in a pile there as well. And uh, so the indigenous story goes, you know, and this might be a part of the dream time, I don't want to get this bit wrong, but it might be a part of that, like a dream time story and how it happened. But the drain time story is the kids descended off the from the cave down onto, from the escarpment down onto the flat and the kids were told not to kill any serpents, like don't kill a snake, you know, they're off limits.

Speaker 1:          01:17:25       And uh, the kids go down there and they can't find anything to eat. And I find a serpent, like a young snake. So they grabbed this knife and cut its head off and it doesn't die. It keep squiggling and moving around. And then, um, so they keep chopping or that they chop it into little bits and it keeps squiggling around and won't die. They bash it with a rock and I won't die at keep squiggling around. Then they fry it in a fire and the fire still doesn't kill it as just in pain and squirming and squiggling around there. And the mother serpent, you heard this commotion, the kids go back up to the escarpment and into the cave. But the mother serpent comes up and they never used to be a creek there. And she come up with such a rage that she carved the creek through the land.

Speaker 1:          01:18:06       So this is how a lot of their dream time stories go. And uh, so she carved that creek in that were actually camped on. She went up, she found the people in the cave after fine, her, her young dead, and she lead a fly all the way around them. She raised into the cave and she burned them out and she burned them to death. So that, you know, that's, that's the indigenous story. The, the white fellow story is the indigenous, and I'm not saying one's true or one's not true, but I'll tell you how the story goes. The white fellow story is, that was one of the first cattle stations in the northern territory of Australia and the indigenous, we're picking off cattle to eat and I wouldn't have known any different, right? It's an animal. Um, and uh, the station owners found this out like a fan, that way the indigenous will live in and I took them food as a gift, but it was all laced with poison and they end up all dine in the cave.

Speaker 1:          01:19:02       So, you know, there's two, two versions of the story, obviously. Yeah. It's the second one. Yeah. I don't want to say because who frigging knows, but I definitely know that nick isn't going around lighting fires. Probably not, but I know what you're saying. Yeah. If you listen to enough dream time stories, you know, and that like that will, they have for a long time, you know, here that was so hot, that was so good at hunting because you know, a lot of people say, oh, the indigenous didn't come up with a bow and arrow. They didn't need to like wine events aren't and you didn't need that was so good with boomerangs and species and you know, the way that they wanted that they didn't need a boner. You know, it was insane. So there are beautiful rice, but they're still very young to western society.

Speaker 1:          01:19:49       You know, I think we spoke about this last time. Jamie, can you find it? How old? Well when was like the northern territory of Australia really pioneered because that's the population of indigenous that we're talking about. They've been thrown into this western society, you know, that we have come through slowly with that. That essentially that was still in the stone age because you know that that's all I needed within territory in 18, 25. The area occupied today in the northern territory is part of the colony of New South Wales was first settled by Europeans in 18, 24 at Fort Dundas. Port Essington in 18, 63 control of the area was given to South Australia. Isn't that crazy? It's not even 200 years old, dude. That's crazy. Yeah, and so these people have been there for how many thousands of years before that look. Look that up too because I don't want to get it wrong.

Speaker 1:          01:20:39       One of the things that you were telling me that I thought was really fascinating, we were just hanging out at my house was how many different languages they have. Yeah, yeah. There's like, I think there's over 700 dialects and you could literally have a mob of indigenous on this part of the mainland and just a little bit further down another mob of indigenous, and I wouldn't speak the same language, says the northern northern territory provides evidence of settlement around 60,000 years ago. I think it's just been blown right out of the water and it's a lot longer than that now. Really? Yep. Recently? Yep. Just recently. Yeah. I remember reading something. That's right. What's the super recently like a week ago or so. Yeah. Yeah. And as I'm so now findings to suggest that I'm Egyptian, come over at some point, especially these two brothers and one of the province is a story that goes.

Speaker 1:          01:21:30       One of the brothers was really sick and you know, he had to look after him and um, uh, I, I can't remember how it ends, but you know, that Egyptians had come here just because of some of the signs that they found in those days was like a story noted down on some rocks and things like that. So it's really crazy. The history behind Australia when you think of it like that, and when you think of how young it is here it goes. Aboriginal architectural discovery in. How do you say that word? Cock. I do Kacadoo. Yep. Could do rewrites. The history of Australia, northern territory. Aboriginal people have lived in Australia, a minimum of 65,000 years of chemo, of archeologist has established 18,000 years longer than it had been proved previously and at least 5,000 years long that had been speculated by the most optimistic researchers.

Speaker 1:          01:22:17       Wow. Crazy. I. Yeah, pretty crazy. It's a long fucking time, man. Pay Five thousand years. Today. The story about the damp Jacoba Lego area in the Pilgra, that's what I mentioned earlier. That's right near where I have my business and as I have a 70,000 rock arts on the archipelago itself. They still don't know the significance of it. 70,000, but there's a story that goes. The indigenous that lived on the mainland with cy, much different than the people that lived on the islands like cold on the canoe people or the boat people that if those canoe or boat people live or come near the mine land, the indigenous mob that lived on the mainland would clear out of there might get out of it because I was so different in the way that leave. The way they spoke, the way they looked was so different that it was like a foreign person to.

Speaker 1:          01:23:09       I'm now scared of them, Jesus Christ. It's just amazing how many different dialects. It's insane. Isn't that what you were saying, that you could just go a couple of kilometers away and they spoke a totally different way? That's correct. Yeah. I couldn't understand each other. Nope. I couldn't understand each other. So, so with my business, like I've been very fortunate to work closely with a lot of indigenous people wherever it's Arnhem land, um, where I go hunting a lot or it's with my business because in my business I've got a joint venture with an indigenous business owner, which is, I'm sure she's a lovely woman. She's awesome. And I also have a thing where I employ at least 25 percent indigenous local indigenous people and I actually usually blow them out the 50 percent at some, which is, which is awesome. You know the deal, it's mandated by a treaty or the government.

Speaker 1:          01:24:00       Really the, the mining, the mining companies that I work for would prefer an indigenous joint venture owner of 25 percent. Then what I've taken on is my, for myself is just, I want the 25 percent or more indigenous employees as well, local indigenous people. So I've been, I've been close to a lot of them and you hear a lot of their different stories, but one of the things is um, where my business is the man, the. Sorry, the woman has the say in the relationship, everything, financial, everything like that. But just two hours away the man has, it's the complete opposite in the main has the site and everything. So it's just two hours away. But anyway, some of these indigenous, you know, have married into, you know, someone from two hours away, like the Pilbara region and they're always like, oh, can we move back to onslow?

Speaker 1:          01:24:58       Whether we're. The man gets to say it's really, really funny, but I'm just like that in my relationship. It's whoever's the most fucking pissed off in the day gets a little bit of both. So That's interesting. So if they moved then they would switch roles, switches and that happens all the time. So they just accept it. Yeah. They just accept it and the whole tribe agrees. That's the whole model agrees that never exists, doesn't, it probably doesn't run so smoothly there even though he knows that the other real and it's really hard for a lot of westerners. Don't understand. He's a solitary one story about uh, I'll, I'll Kevin traditional liner that go hunting out on his land. He's, he's been out on camp with me for a couple of weeks and he hasn't had any, anything about water and like a bit of red meat that I've shot him and stuff like that and finish that.

Speaker 1:          01:25:53       He's been catching for himself. Anyway. He's got family coming out and he says, you know, it gives them a little grocery list that they could bring from town for him anyway. They bring the groceries and like, I don't think in la he hasn't know. He hasn't had anything to really drink or you know, he's just had the real basic stuff for fair wall. They get there, nothing's been taken out of the bags, but once I hand it to him, I just start reaching whatever he's grabbed out reach and like, so he got a couple of bottles of coke and all the kids and relatives of drinking the coke and like they leave and we put about this much coke. He gets a pack of cigarettes or lead hands going like grab cigarettes. He doesn't look at them once. Like he doesn't go to say no.

Speaker 1:          01:26:32       Like I haven't had a smoke for a couple of weeks or a drink for a couple of ways. Doesn't even blink dude or anything. Just everyone takes and they just leave him with a little bit and all this thinking, fuck. If that was me I'd be like, Oh boy, I haven't had frequent cigarette smoke but I haven't had a cigarette for a couple of weeks. Like ease up and it didn't bother me one bit because that's how I. Oh, but when one of them has something that, that he doesn't have, he's quite welcomed the reach in and grab whatever he wants as well.

Speaker 3:          01:26:58       They say that was an issue with a native Americans as well, that they didn't understand property. Yeah. Yeah. Don't understand property and just sharing what they do and it's just normal. It was this property thing came out of the Europeans. They didn't understand. So they would do the same thing, would take the animals, would take the food. And it was normal for. So if someone had left something, some of the accounts of European settlers were talking about that, how native Americans seem to have no understanding at all. Why people would be upset that they would. Someone would take their problem. Yeah. And you say that in the fuel of the movies as

Speaker 1:          01:27:29       well that know they've kept that dialect. But um, the other thing that I was going to cite is, so it's something to be like high ambient, you know, like we, like we used to talk about going on walkabout and things like that. Like a lot of the guys that I would get would get their first Pi and then not show up to work the next morning and like come back two months later and just walk straight into the depot. Like, like, hey boss. And I'd be like, uh, I haven't seen you for a couple of months, might look, what are you doing? I'm here for work. Well not obviously because I'd get there, pay their paycheck and I'd just be happy and go off with it for those couple of months or whatever. And they're not all like that. But a lot of them would do that.

Speaker 1:          01:28:12       And it took me a long time to understand, especially being a business owner and just wanting everything to run nice and smooth. That that's just how a lot of them are, you know. And it is something to be envious about because the other thing that would happen is in the mine sites are pushing for indigenous employees at this time and I'd load them up with indigenous employees. Then there'll be a deaf, you know, in the family and a funeral. Like they won't bury their dead until everyone from the mobs there. So and because some of them live so far out and Bush, it could take a week for a funeral or some funerals go for weeks and weeks, months dude. And these guys wouldn't show up. And I'd have the client ringing me up saying, you know, like, what's going on? You guys aren't here today.

Speaker 1:          01:28:57       Well, if you want indigenous employees and indigenous business, this what happens in, you need to understand their culture now. There's been a lot of um, cultural awareness. Um, a lot of cultural awareness has gone out there to the mine sites that now they're all understanding that as well. So they know if there's a funeral on that they're not going to have their indigenous people there anymore. So the indigenous people have an adjusted. No, they haven't. No. They have to a certain degree on some things, but not a lot. And I shouldn't have to worry about. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:29:28       But when they take off, they don't get paid. You got to get work, goes off on a walkabout and comes back two months later. Did you just take them back in? Oh, I am now. Yeah. We usually do just because it's just cultural awareness. I'm aware of how their culture is. And that's interesting because uh, when, whenever an invasive culture moves into an indigenous culture because this battle, right? Try to figure out whose, whose lifestyle winds out. Yep. And that's decimated the native American

Speaker 1:          01:30:03       and I'm thinking all of the cities and more populated places in Australia definitely has, you know, but I've just been lucky enough to go into some of these remote areas where that's not the case still. Yeah. And like I said, you look in on them and you're just like, I wish I could live my life like that. It's like they don't want, I don't want some of the things that we want, you know? Yes. They probably. Well, I don't know. I mean maybe they envy some of the ways that we live as well. I don't fucking think so. I think some of them do. Yeah. But I look at them out there out Bush, you know, like when their ride out and it's just like this is the way law should be lived. It's like there's no rush to do anything cold, get anywhere and just they just live in life. Dude.

Speaker 2:          01:30:48       Well that's how you like to live too. I mean you like to like just be out like when you're at your cabin, spent a tremendous amount of time at your cabin just out hunting. Pretty chill now. That's the thing about where you live. I mean you have so many invasive species, so much, so many deer and pigs. You could just go like that. Yeah, it's amazing. Yeah. So I do get to hunt a lot. So you just eat wild game constantly. Yeah, pretty much like your wedding mouth laid out. Woo. She's wild pork.

Speaker 1:          01:31:23       Hi. Those like meatballs which are like, which was like a deer pig mix for like three days. Dude. God, breakfast, lunch and dinner. So good. All that wild. It was awesome. And it was, it was an awesome experience to go out, harvest that, meet me self, then put it on for like 60, 70 people at the wedding. Yeah, it was cool. I'm like, this is from right here. Like right here off the farm. That's crazy. Yeah. Yeah. No, you're living man. You need to come over dude. You've got to kill all those bugs first to say that Scorpion, that Brittany know, because I've always been like, I'd actually never been bitten. I got bitten by a spider on the arm once. What's an orb spider? They're not too bad, but like this side went numb. We'll at least saw idea. Okay. That's bad dude. Yeah. But it's not like bad luck. It's going to kill you real sick.

Speaker 1:          01:32:17       So jerk off the day before the wedding. Yeah. That's a god. No, he's, that's the fellow they had beat me, but they're not so they're not too bad, but I'd never looked up. Um, I've never looked up scorpions before because I've never been bitten mine. And I've just heard a few rumors that you can get really sick from the little ones. And I picked up a bit of timber walls building, like the bond that I was doing, an original photo was just a splinter that cracked me and then do this hand felt like it was about 10 times the size, like in 20 seconds, his hand just felt like it was just swelling up. It wasn't, it looked fine, but then you could see my veins popping out. You could feel the like the poison running up me arm. It come all about these, um, sort of disappeared once I got into my chest and like I ran over to the cabin with me Buddy Antonio there.

Speaker 1:          01:33:08       I'm like fucking lookup Scorpion Bites right now. Like one just cracked me and it's excruciating. And uh, he looked it up and he's like, worst case scenario, have a cardiac arrest. But it's in very limited cases. So I'm like, well, what's the normal case? And it's just excruciating pain for up to two or three days, two or three days. Anyway, once it got into my chest, it sort of disappeared. I did feel a bit nauseous and stuff like that. But then two, I am in the morning that drifted down into these leg on the opposite side, like woke me up like it was just killing me. Like you little fucker there. Only this fucking big too so I can pick a punch. Yeah, about an inch long. Just a tiny little thing like that. That didn't happen to me thing. Christ necrosis. Yeah. But I understand you can like it you, it's not, not freaking good, but the day of the wedding, while we're all getting ready to meet good friend Ben Chambers was there all have a freaking building sentence deal or whatever I was doing and I hear a bit of commotion.

Speaker 1:          01:34:08       I look over, he's frigging wrestling, have to spotted blue belly black snake, which we've actually never had on the property before. And they really aggressive like, hey, sorta tried to hold it out of a. So I couldn't latch back and get him. Like I've got all these people showing up for a wedding and there was a frigging venomous snake running around. Venice is a black snake. Uh, I've heard that they give you a real bad migraine but they can do the sign, like, you know, you can have cardiac arrest, you can have a bad reaction to it. So there's a lot of shit that can go on there. But um, my eight grabs this stick and a red belly, black snake, wackier and then usually let go these things in the Torres for grabbing you and just pumping you with venom. That's what makes them the worst of the black snakes.

Speaker 1:          01:34:52       Now just grab onto you and keep pumping you with venom and they won't, they won't do a drive by it. A lot of snakes do a drive by it and uh, but anyway, this is like the friggen an hour away from the wedding started dude. And he's tangled in this snake up random stick. Then he lets it go like further away from the cabin and when he lets it go, it spews up a bloody brown snake. And I sent you a video once before have a snakes. We went up another snake, this thing, beautiful full brands, Nike and then took all snakes are super poisonous. Exactly. Yes. I probably should have left it alive because it's taken care of the brand's native population. It has a taste for what kills. You shouldn't lift the pride as a cabinet. I mean, if it only gives you a headache.

Speaker 1:          01:35:31       Yeah, but most of the time, like in Australia and I've like, I've walked thousands of miles, dude. No, never, ever had a problem. That's why you need to come out. Boy, that's not a convincing argument. Count. Come visit the farm. I'll take you out to the cabinet. Sounds good. Can I get an armored suit? Kevlar, underwear. It seems like a terrible idea. I brought you that buffalo skull because I'm like, you're fucking never coming, so I'm always bringing you one of them. White buffaloes. I would come to Australia. I just. I'm not going buffalo hunting. You guys are out of your fucking mind. You pretty safe. Pretty safe. No crocodiles. Rock it out. Is that the snake? So that's a red belly things beautiful. He is pissed off seats. Flattening these neck out like that. God, it's so beautiful. Yeah. That's a red belly. Black staff. They're pretty harmless.

Speaker 1:          01:36:23       So pretty. I've actually had me head back on the stick before and I had it was cold rod up beyond me head and they'll lift up and have a look in the grass and he lifted right up beside me on my mood. I don't want to get bit and then he just relaxed and chilled out. So you just had to just lay that second from the left. Jamie. That looks like a spot is that says this says blue bell in here, but you much much of it. Yeah. That's one. That bright shiny black box to the right click on these. They just stopped all those videos. That is a gorgeous creature. It's not uncommon to see a few of them for the summer boy hunting, but they, like I said, they really placid. So those are set. But how the fuck do you do me a favor while you look at it.

Speaker 1:          01:37:10       Andrew equals. I saw this thing on your instagram. Yeah. And then you'll find him on youtube. Then he's got these video where he catches, I think it's two brown snakes and a red belly black snake and he puts them down rabbit holes and then they chased the rabbits out electronic. They trying to get shelter. They chased these rabbits out and he ended up catching the rabbits. It's frigging hilarious. So he uses either. He's like, he's older videos. I just seen it. That one there. Do. I mean the top one? Just the one or the one above it. This one here, he's doing something wild rabbits with thinks not it. Nah, that one day. This dude's a freak. Hey. Hey Holly. Shit. That was a few years ago. It was pretty Australian. He's various drained. I can't keep doing this shit. Your fucking numbers coming up rather. So these snakes are what kind of snakes?

Speaker 1:          01:38:07       Dave to red belly. Black snake. So those will kill you? Nah, I won't kill you. Those or had a bad reaction. Yeah. Their headaches. Snakes and making them. Well one of them's try and do. Now it's getting a bit revved up. Yeah, me just walking around. He's got some serious control. So when they lift up the strike, he drops them down a little bit, you know, because I can't fight against their own weight like that can grab it. He just saw gun in his hand. What the fuck is wrong with this? This is your buddy? Yeah, he's my buddy. He's a bowhunter now. He doesn't hunt. Why should he high? Just fucking hands while he's wearing gym shorts. Dude. He's just done Africa maybe a couple of years ago. He chases a pride of lions off a fucking kill. What chase is the product lines? Bluffs amount. It has elephants chasing him down, dude. And he outruns elephants in sign. Does he have a death wish? He must have. Do you think he does either. He's got some screws loose. At least. Can you identify the taste of.

Speaker 1:          01:39:21       Oh, I've been there before. It says. Yeah. So he drops his snakes down the dry run out? Yeah, he drops him down the hall. What he does is he grabs a rabbit. Rabbit rabbit. Yeah. So he has run into a net. I'm not sure. One or the other. Yeah. I just watched him wrestle a full size bull buffalo what? Yeah, he pretty much. He lasted this bull and on film. And this is on this last buffalo. A water buffalo. The one that you fuck her. He lasted. Is One of those. But because the hair, the horns are, you kind of get the last one hone. So it comes off my um, I've got along video. It misses him by. I don't, I recognize a couple of feet. This thing is on his ass, but he can run. But I'm like, dude, one trip. And you fuck the.

Speaker 1:          01:40:14       How fast is the water buffalo? Fast off the mom. It might just the head like, just the white in the head could squish your body in half if it got you against the grant or a tree. So I imagined the rest of it's whole body white grown. And you do to turn you in the and pepper. What's the end game for this guy? What's he doing this for? A thrill. I think I've done some stuff with them out there. A backpack done. So look at this monkey having a root in the back. This is Africa, this sample clip. What is he doing? He's Kinda chased one of the baboons. Fuck. Oh, Jesus Christ.

Speaker 2:          01:40:55       Why is he chasing baboons? Traveling's will fuck you up. A nearly dies on this trip. Something by it. More funding. Get some. Oh my God. So he just chased off all these baboons by running at him. This is not seemed. Why's that? What concerns me more than anything is that other people are going to copy. This guy is 100 with thin. Yeah. Because he obviously is very skilled. I mean if you could call it skilled, knowledgeable. What's the word? He's done it before. He's experienced shit. He comes to Christ. Hooky. Tenanting took a. he's got no shirt on folks. He's wearing gym shorts and he's uh, he's. Can you give me some volume so I can hear this crazy. Fuck talk

Speaker 4:          01:41:42       in that last little bit of footage. You can see me rolling on the ground. Old Close. But even in these animals understand that they understand one, look at me with my two legs, two arms standing upright. My vision forward. These animals understand that I'm a potential threat to them. I'm not food on the friend.

Speaker 2:          01:42:02       A fresh fuck. Crazy fucking crazy. One of those lines. Just the guy just needs the guy. No, you're fucking not been travel. I'm ready to put this down. That tissue paper skin that we have covered the fucking water balloon and blood. We call a body. They used to tear and open like freaking buffalo and shit. Shit ain't nothing man. Oh Jesus. What is he doing? Why is he have a crocodile? Why is he putting the last around a fucking crocodile? This guy's crazy defeated to coconut. He fed it a coconut. Yeah. Mind defeated a coconut. Why not like to put it in its mouth so it can't bite? Okay, give me some volume as crazy. They must be in Africa because you can't stay. Says, this is what I did. The same thing. I started talking to animals and I'm like, fucking like, they don't understand English. There's no use telling him to calm down. I'm not fucking eight year. If the student doesn't even have

Speaker 4:          01:43:04       pushover. Crocodile is around three and a half thousand pounds. Compare this to us humans and it's only 200 pounds and you'll soon realize why this guy was a title as niche as boss.

Speaker 2:          01:43:24       Crazy fucker has a coconut in the crocodiles mouth and he's trying to get the crocodile, the crack a coconut for forum. Oh my God, dude, he's, he's, he's awesome. You know. So what does this do for a living? Fucking youtube and stuff for the network. Tickle, tickle, tickle. He's actually a real moment to tell you the truth. Really just lives in the bush. Yeah, Jesus. But I mean, doesn't have to feed himself like he a job.

Speaker 1:          01:43:58       Hayes, he doesn't cry the shit he's about to do some massive trek dude with nothing and just walk through some wild country.

Speaker 1:          01:44:08       And so one of the reasons why he was anonymously and with me up north was he's trying to learn off the indigenous about a lot of the Bush Tucker luck. A lot of the food that he can find out in the bush, like yams and different like fruits and stuff like that. He knows all the wildlife stuff that he can eat, but the indigenous has spent, you know, a long time trying to work out what they can incarnate and there's heaps of things that you can eat, but they've got to be boiled for a certain amount of period. You can only eight to this far into it and things like that. I've watched you fucking cock at dude. There's a, there's a, I don't know if it's a route or type of fruit and you definitely can't eat it, like crush it up and they put it in the water and it takes a lot of the water and all the fish float. Oh, I've seen that in South American. Yeah, I got yet. So imagine how long it took to work out. That actually looked like. That's crazy, isn't it?

Speaker 2:          01:44:58       That's another thing that they eat in Bolivia. Casaba. Yeah. I've never heard of that. I haven't. No. It's a route that if you eat it raw, it's super toxic as a whole really involved process where you have to. You have to soak it and then you have to drain it very similar and then it turns into A. There's actually Sinai that comes out of it.

Speaker 2:          01:45:27       Yeah. See if you can find a video, Jamie, on preparation of Casaba and this cassava is apparently Rinella was telling me about it. That's what it was. I had read about it before, but Rinella was telling me how poisonous it is that the stuff that they like, but that good. That's like birth gay lover. That's what it looks like. So, um, they, they have these buckets around the camp fire. You've got to find a better video than this. This cat. So good. All the rest of her recipes that. I mean, some of those preparing. Yeah. Well there's a really involved process in order to cook it.

Speaker 1:          01:46:12       Yeah. So yeah, you get it right or you're dead. You're dead, you know?

Speaker 2:          01:46:17       Yeah. Just amazing that they figured this out so you have to do all this stuff to it and prepare it. And the actual buckets of liquid. They were saying Rinella was talking about how they just leave them around the camp and he was like, what if, what if a kid drinks that? They don't. So she's cooking it up. Just got some way to special anyway. Anyway, but yeah, I mean how long did it take them to figure out that if they can grind that plan up, throw it in the water official Pamela

Speaker 1:          01:46:46       died eating their cells because it looks like a fruit. Yeah. And there's so many in the Australian outback that look and smell and even taste good. But man, I'll kill you. Baseball crazy when you think about the trial and error involved in figuring out what you can and can't eat. Mother, motherfucker. Now we've got all these books. Least that takes the, takes the mystery out of stuff like that. But even then people screw it up. Oh, official time with mushrooms. I nearly did it the other day. There's one that it's um, it's sort of tastes similar to an apple, but a little bit like on the sour side, if it was an unripe apple, it's completely edible. There's another one that looks nearly exactly the same, but it drops the same pink flare at the bottom of it. It's got this little spike that comes off it and so I'd been walking around eating these other ones because I didn't have hardly any food and then I'm like, oh, there's a freaking whole heap of me and I grabbed, grabbed them and just put them in the backpack, got to this waterhole, crack that open and just force shit is at the same time and then I smelled it and straight away.

Speaker 1:          01:47:45       It's not the same time. It didn't have the same seeds or anything, but how quick of a mistake to make and that one, that second one that I grabbed his really frigging poisonous too. So it's like, oh yeah, I need to carry a Bush Tucker book with me, but at least those books out there now food things. Yeah, I've seen those ads around. Yeah, they use them for Sushi apparently. Like the really a skillful Sushi chefs. They slice through this thing and filet it put what the fuck. The smallest mistake in preparation could be fatal, but Tokyo city's government is planning to ease restrictions that allow only highly trained and licensed chef to serve the dish. Fuck all that. We'll just have a fucking eighth and normal fish cross too many crazy assholes. But I think it's for people, they like the thrill of knowing that they're reading something that could kill, you know, if prepared incorrectly. He sounds like a fucking nail company. Montana.

Speaker 1:          01:48:43       So how good that elk taste though. Knowing what all the way through it. Well, because all the stuff and by the end like you can, you can only have limited food with you. And then even though I come out of the wall, you know, for like I come into town and bought the bullets, I didn't go to a store and be like, I'm going to load up on a heap of other food and shit. Got For me. That was going to wreck the trip, you know? So I just go into town, grab the bull bullets. Yeah, fucking wood. It was a challenge to live off the land I did. Yeah. I wanted to live off the land. I must have brought some food with you, right? Yeah. Like, so the first probably the first 11 daylight. Pretty good. What did you bring with you? Your meals?

Speaker 1:          01:49:20       You know, little energy bars, just because everything's got to be light, you know, so most everything was dehydrated or just like a light type of food is simple. Simple as it is. And then heaps of chocolate bars. Actually, they're not that light, but fuck, you need them when you're out there, you need to pack that energy back on and keep going. So he hates the chocolate bars. And then specific ones. Do you use or just anyone you can get? Just I can get just regular chocolate, snickers bars. That shit locked up, right? Yeah. Calories. Yeah. Just calories. Half the chocolate bars in America. I don't even know what they are. And then I opened them up and I'm like, ah, that shit, you know, because I did it so deep. Different back in Australia, but we do have sneakers, but like we've got a Mars bar.

Speaker 1:          01:50:06       You don't have a Mars bar here. It's called a Milky Way. No, we have Mars idea, I couldn't find them anywhere and then be favorite it. Oh, they have mars bars here. I must have went to the wrong store was fucking dirty, but I bought the milky ways which are different back in Australia as well. And they are more similar to a Mars bar. So. But yeah, so the first 11 days I pretty well, but I'd still, if I could spare food, like if I could shoot a grouse. Oh elite, that if I come across barriers I'd eat those. M and I sort of had contact with um, April Voki who's like really into the outdoors and fly fishing and stuff. She knows a lot of Australia. I did, yeah. Yeah. And she's, she's hunted with us a few times and her get along like a house on fire. So it works out good so far. Good House. You don't have that same eva get along like a house on fire. That seems like a terrible way to get along with your fucking furious.

Speaker 1:          01:51:02       That's a few of those weird ones and I'm like, how'd they even come up with that one right there? You know, like jump the gun. Did they actually jump the gun? Yeah. Well that's jumping. The starting block already sent. Bang. Jumped the noise. No, jumped the gun. Makes Sense. It makes more sense to get along like a house on fire unless you have the fire because you're fucking burning up your gun blazing so you could look at it like that as well. See where you're going with that. Yeah. Um, so April was sort of my go to person. Like if, if I had reception, I'd take a photo and be like, can I make this? The worst thing is because she, sometimes she be busy. I'd be collecting heaps of them. Like I'd need that and she'd be like, definitely not. And I'll be like fuck, but I'm most things just from taste and a few things already knew.

Speaker 1:          01:51:52       But there'd be some areas, especially up high where those beers were, where I was seeing that grizzly in Colorado. There was barry's everywhere and that's obviously one of the bays where they, oh, okay. You ate those berries. Just like frigging raspberries, blueberries. There's those rows, nips. Do you know those? They look, they don't look edible and they're pretty hard, but they're really good for you, but you hate too many of them. They'll make you feel itchy. Itchy. Yeah. Which I never felt itchy, but I didn't want to get to that point. Like walking around hunting. Really? They make you itchy. When we instituted crack, what was the word? Was the word that you used? Bush something. Bushtukah. Bush Tucker. What does that mean? Taco? You Americans need that? Come up with a scratch. You fucking mall. Can't say fucking as ing. Ing. It's got to be a n

Speaker 2:          01:52:46       on the end of the fucking. You'd say Ian, where you would say I am. And then put an apostrophe. Yeah, right. Fucking fucking fucking mall there. You gotta say I was trying to fit right in. Perfect. You'd get to get used to driving on the wrong side of the road. No, it's the right side. I'm pretty sure. But yeah, so April was my go to. What does that mean though? Bush? Tacos. Food. So food. Bush Tucker talk his food truck. Taco Tucker. Tucker. Yeah. Talk. Let's go get some tucker. Yeah, let's go and get some tacos. Go get some top. Have you ever heard that young Jeremy know that is, this is normal. It is very normal for who? For dry heat. And it's just like a dialect that you picked up with the outback. No, it's pretty fucking. Thank God for Google show called Bush food is any food native to Australia and use assessments by the original inhabitants to aboriginal Australians.

Speaker 2:          01:53:44       But it can also describe native for or Florida Flora or fauna. Um, so that was something. Did you pick up from the indigenous people? No, I think I'll just rise like that. You know, so it's just a phrase grew up out in the Bush Tucker, the woods. Mar Lou is what you call a kangaroo. Yeah, they're indigenous names Maher. Lou, Bard. Dewar. Uh, what does that word that looks like it could be magpie geese. And what is that one? What does that, how does that word Yali. That's the name you. Yay. You Halle Berry. And so do the people, the indigenous people they date Kangaroos? Yeah. Yeah, definitely. Kangaroos, wallabies. Go in and see every kangaroo. Yep. Yep. Um, it's a very rich red meat, like a really, really rich red meat. Good. It's delicious. And it's super lean, like there's no fat content to it. And so do you buy it in a store? You can. What the fuck is that man? That's bullshit. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, it's bullshit. How is it bullshit guys? Holding Brown sounded real. Grub? No, it's like a wood grabber. Witchetty grubs. That good? Aiden. Oh. So it's not really that big. Wide. Not that day. Good grubs there. That'd be witchetty grubs in good grubs. Hold on. So you see those? Oh, thems. Good grubs. Like you, you'd go eat those. Have you seen that video?

Speaker 2:          01:55:18       GRUBS went up. They building the cabinet and I'm stripping the bark off it. You will see all those grubs and I get them and cook them up and eat and eat them. Just like paint up out at night, but better. They taste like peanut butter. Yeah, they do. Yeah. Really? Yeah. Probably even better than peanut butter. What kind of peanut butter do you guys have in Australia? They pretty good. What does that? Uh, honey and honey and sugar ants. Those are good. Yep. Yep. And if you run out of like a, if you're running out of tea or you know, if you want a hot drink and you're out in the bush, then you'd boil your water and then you'd get a heap of those in a leaf or on a leaf and you dip them in hot water and it makes like a nice tea. But it's like sweetened already from the ant. I carry like a sugary taste on them. Whoa. So that little thing on there but is actually honey. Yep. They have a little bubble pack. Well it's not really honey, but it tastes like honey. Really? Yeah. It looks like honey though. Well what is it? I'm pretty sure that anything that can produce honey, that's crazy though. The Bar, that's their abdomen essentially, right? Yep. So it looks like those black things settled as a separated. Rather. It's, we'd look fucking some in photoshop.

Speaker 2:          01:56:29       So strange. So they're tiny. Strange because we don't eat it. But imagine those things were grown on a farm or and harvested for mass production. No different than lame or I know what insects do. We ate none, which is frigging weird. Why wouldn't we ate insects? They food. People are starting to eat crickets and frogs and crickets being bugs. Yeah. A lot of people eat crickets these days. Cricket, protein powder. It's very popular in America. I think it will become, I shouldn't say very like there's two people in all of America. We'd becoming more properly. They have, um, I think they have a nice cricket protein bar that you can buy. I haven't tried them but I send a Mexico, but I've heard good things about them. But I've been in Mexico and we went to this resort and when you check into your hotel room, they have like a little bowl of fried crickets really with chili powder and stuff.

Speaker 2:          01:57:22       Proudly strange. What is that? That the company and they sell crooked. Oh, xl. What's his Goddamn pop up ads? So Ekso Exoskeleton is curriculum. I can understand why we wouldn't eat, but we should have six. Well, not only that, but vegans should shitty them because it's a great way to get be 12 and most people don't really care that much about bugs. It's like the, the, the, the thing about Vegan seems to be a sentient animals and worrying about killing these. I'm feeling life for them and if they, if that's the way they feel, they could be far healthier. Eating mollusks mollusks are a big one. They don't feel shit and they're fucking stupid. Like marks they say are dumber than plants are more primitive than plants. The fact that they move is what freaks people out, but what does a Vegan eat? A Venus fly trap. Would they eat that fucking moves to plant on the move. They just take a left on the move and grow. Exactly. But crickets are really good source of protein, so if someone wants to get animal or some sort of living proteins, particularly like the nutrients and amino acids that you can get from that kind of protein, just look into insects don't die. You fuckers. I'm going to stop my insect farming to it, bitch. Fuck. This is. Hey, become a millionaire. Seems like a tough.

Speaker 1:          01:58:43       I mean, trust me. Fuck. Is it a tough sell with aiden? Little lambs? Well, not only can't dry. We're eating kangaroos. And how about crabs and lobsters? Which water? Yeah, crickets in particular. Tastes good. I'm telling you man, I was grabbing on those crickets in Mexico. They had like a nice chili powder on fried and like luxe, other like crunchy kind of savory, a little savory. They were good. They would like. I would buy him. Yeah, that sounds good. Days grabs that. I'm talking about a delicious to draw the line. Not Full. Delicious. It's just the full delicious. That's the whole thing that the Australian say full fully or full. Amazing. Fully sick. Fully sick. Mad Come. That is a good expression. Cut. Cameron. I, I actually, some people might've been from me saying that and they were like, where can I get mad cunt? Shit.

Speaker 1:          01:59:44       Your. They had nice. Can't because a can't or a bad con and the shirt that everyone wanted the. I actually got one printed out but it didn't come and tell them I was gonna. Wear it here. Be Interested. Just being nice. Can. It's as simple as that, where you guys are very different use of the word cunt. Yeah. Is like a good dude. Well, be mad if you say mad con. That's awesome. That's, that's a bad motherfucker. But if you're lucky, you're a fucking cunt, right? No, that's interesting. Yeah. Have much more range with the word content. Do I love Australians? Like even though you're going to say yes or no, they're always like, Yay. So they start with you and then they were like, Nah. Yeah, yeah. No, that's a good one. That's a good one. Yeah. Or if you're going to say no, then go.

Speaker 1:          02:00:41       No, you sake. You shake your head, but you say no, it means I don't give a fuck. You pick what you want. So yes, you're nodding yes. Kim will be like, you know, should I this swimsuit? You know, and I'll be like, no, because whatever, whatever the fuck I say, doesn't matter. She's going to get what she wants. Yeah. You know what I've developed. I developed an amazing ability to not listen when someone's talking. That's what I've been doing. This whole show. Oh man, I don't mean I could hear they talk about stuff that I like, especially with my wife gets together with her friends. They can have a conversation that could be right there. I don't hear a fucking thing came lobby in a field. Just hearing truth.

Speaker 1:          02:01:37       You're antisocial. I'm like, no, not antisocial. I just don't have to talk about everything. I'm quite happy. Sitting there quietly thing think is a very big biological difference between the way women like to especially a guy like you who does so much hunting where it's very valuable to be quiet. Yeah. I've actually had some friends say to me like that I'm very antisocial and it's like you're not interested in hanging out with first and stuff like that. And friends hunt. Yeah, they do. But I like hunting solo, like I just, but it's not like a choice that I'm like, I'm not fucking taken humor. I'm not inviting him or whatever, but I'm just happy to do it alone. So if I'm planning a trip, I don't necessarily plan it around someone else's time or something like that. So they think you're antisocial because I wouldn't do it.

Speaker 1:          02:02:25       Well the, yeah, and they and they're a little bit like, um, they also like, how can you just go out there by yourself like that, like don't you get bored or you don't miss talking to someone or whatever. And then, and it's taken me years to figure it out, like why am I so comfortable being by myself or not saying a word in a crowd of people at a talk and, or, and like, you know, my past growing up. But a lot of it's been from my past growing up and like I've nailed it. It's like I grew up with people that were supposed to be loved. Ones that didn't show love at all. In fact they taught you the complete opposite instead of teaching trust, like poor distrust because this is supposed to be a person that's close and treat your world and they're fucking treating you like shit.

Speaker 1:          02:03:06       So you slowly start moving away from sort of mankind in a sense where we started association associating people with a negative feeling. Exactly. And so the way that I'd get treated, you know, growing up was I'd be better off by myself, you know, I'm better off safer, Kim sort of that now. But that's what I mean, has she directed it? But um, yeah, I grew up all those years knowing, you know, not to trust people and people are fucking actually dangerous and stuff like that. So I'm happy being off by myself and doing my own thing. And then like I said, now it's different. I've got my own family and I know the complete opposite. I trust and love and everything like that. But it's also the hunting thing for you that when you're hunting you're just locked in on the task at hand to a degree.

Speaker 1:          02:03:53       Definitely don't want someone with you that's going to mess it up or not because I'm not a self that, that sort of sounds a little bit selfish. I don't mean it that way. I don't mean it that way. What I mean is it like you're focused now definitely focused on need anybody else? But when you're focused you don't, you really don't need anybody else. It's just the, the, the task, just you against the elements. Yeah, I, I, I think it's that it's pushing myself. It's, I love the fucking wilderness. Like it's just as simple as that. And Joe, like I always feel like, like I love the society we live in and this whole system, but it's not the system that I've designed for myself. Like I'd love to go back 10,000 years, dude. Jesus and believe in them and have a shitty blow though.

Speaker 1:          02:04:41       Fuck. Oh yeah. Arrows would be indigenous to Australia which are running around with a spear and boomerang. Dude, you'd be happy with that. Oh hell yeah. I wouldn't be happy with that. I'm not knowing what I know though. So this is the thing with Kim's fucked it for me. Like I wish he could just be a real bitch and nasty and not good looking and then, you know, it'd be like I am going walkabout. I coming back, funny expression going walk about that is a funny expression. Walkabout. Yeah. Just because I would take him so far to get from wherever they were, you know, because I travel a lot. Um, there's actually, there's, I think there's some hard evidence now that indigenous Australians because there was symbols like right down on the east coast of Australia, the same exact symbols go all the way up the coast to the northern territory.

Speaker 1:          02:05:29       This is a five day drive by the way that the indigenous would walk that, you know, so, so walk about like Kevin used to walk from community. So that's built by the Australian government to housing indigenous people. Then they also have a, we call it on country, but I'm like at our community Jesper, he's mob on his land, you know, Kevin's a traditional owner just, but he's Milan, he's land. They would walk that, it would take them five days to walk it and then so if they went out on country for a while and haunted and stuff like that, which side? I spend another 20 or 30 days out there, maybe longer than another five days walk. You can see why they called it a walkabout. That disappeared. And that's how the science come up. When you go away for a long time is you've gone and walk about because you literally walk that distance, they'd be out on country for certain amount of period and then come back. So that's why I've sort of adopted as well, like when I go walkabout walkabout on Chemo, fair bit.

Speaker 1:          02:06:31       The idea of driving five days that they could walk it. And now these are different. I mean you were talking about all the different dialects and different tribes of people. Now what the hell did they do with they encountered sometimes I'd have that. They'd be war and stuff like that between truck, between mobs. They'd be war and things like that because that I think in most cases they'd try and avoid it and they'd have like their corridor that they walk through. But uh, they all had their own land. What they sort of pretty much caught. I can't say they all had their own lane because there's so many indigenous mobs that. And there was so many differences between them that some of them would just pure nomadic, you know? And just just have written language.

Speaker 1:          02:07:15       I don't know. I think they've written language freaking don't quote me on this was like the dream time and the paintings and everything like that and everyone tells him a story. What's getting lost is it's only the traditional elders that know those stories and they got to pass it on to the next generation. So this is their story. This is their paintings, this is how the story goes when it gets lost is when the mall essentially dies out, you know, or it's not passed on down through the generations. That's just so crazy that there's this enormous population of people and their stories not being told. Yeah, it seems sad when I think about it. In one sense it seems really sad, but in another sense it shouldn't matter to anyone else because it's just those people's language and their stories. So if they die, it's gone with them anyway.

Speaker 1:          02:08:04       Yeah. But I mean it's still, just for the historical record, I think it'd be great for human, just a human life. Definitely to understand that this is a really, uh, a very little understood group of human beings. Don't you height that the mystery is getting taken out of everything though, like it's good to have all that information, like go on Google and find out frigging the age of the last ice age or something like that and which is awesome, but it also cancels out all the mystery. Like we know that there's no other sort of monster crocodile in the waters anymore because the whole world's like right at our fingertips instead of being a hoe out, have that mystery in their mind. Like, oh, I wonder what's out the back there. You know? And that's why I feel like there's no more last frontiers. I love Colon Arnhem Land, the last frontier in places like Northwest Territories, the last frontier because there's hardly any humans out there, but the truth is it's all been discovered.

Speaker 1:          02:09:01       It's all pretty much been documented pipe that you got some like real wanderlust dude, you got side type shit. That's why I'm like, I wish I could go back in. Like there's no way to discover anymore. Like Stuart Macdonald, who's he? He was an alcoholic buddy who's a a is actually a real famous early explorer that come into Australia and Australia was convinced all the people of Adelaide, we're convinced that's where the first settlements were, that there was an inland ocean in Australia because there's all these rivers running out from the center of Australia and it couldn't be the opposite as you know, it's whole fucking desert, but they walk in and out of there so many times and so many men died and a Mcdonald's. Stuart himself nearly died a couple of times from starvation and no water because now walking into the desert. In the end he was successful and he ended up walking all the way through to the top of Australia.

Speaker 1:          02:09:57       Dude, there's no fucking water until you get to the top of Australia. How did he get through it, but imagine being back then when there was all that mystery there was that you were thinking that there was an inland ocean in Australia because of these rivers running out, but those rivers are ancient rivers. They're millions of years old and for so many hundreds of thousand years I haven't even ran on top of the surface. They run onto the sand, didn't the rocks. I was rivers so crazy to think. But at some of the stories is um, he's got an awesome book. Well, he doesn't have an awesome book because he's long gone, but it's an awesome book. Erin called Mr Stewart track and um, there's one point [inaudible] indigenous, like they had never encountered the indigenous and things like that as well. They walk into the center of Australia where it was highly populated with indigenous people.

Speaker 1:          02:10:45       No white people had ever been in there, no settlers before that were literally cutting the first tracks and drawing the maps dude. And like they walk in the one spot and like they, they had been three days or something without water. Like they are on the brink of death and it's, I think it's like a miracle. There's like a little well out there, like a clay built well out in the middle of nowhere and it's got this crystal clear water in it. They keep the cattle and horses at bike because Katelyn horses would smell the water and just go in there and trash it before the man could get there so they keep the cattle and horses that by that going if they on canteens and fill them up and drink and you know, all the manager just getting as much water as I can. Then they've let the horses and cattle go so they can have a drink now.

Speaker 1:          02:11:31       The horses and cattle come in there and they trampled his whole. Well, like it ends up going back to dust because I gave it all in. They drink as much water as I can, like have it all in and uh, the water pretty much dissipates. Then they ride out for three or four days and they can't find water and they've run out of the water that they collected there. They turned back to there and it might have even been longer. It might have been a couple of weeks. I might have been on the way back off the not being able to go any further. And I come back there and there's all these aborigines said dead because the aborigines were the ones that would put the willingness. They walked days and days and they would just have a water source at the last point that just go.

Speaker 1:          02:12:13       They knew water was there. They drink that, be able to make it the next three or four days. The next bit of water. They get there. It's fully caved in. They can't get to the water. There's a whole mob of indigenous people dead there. They. They knew they couldn't go on any further or at least all the ones that were dead. They knew they couldn't go on any further and a dog are there and there was no water. There was no world there anymore. Like the catalog just trampled it. And one thing like as if that's not crazy enough, but one thing that I always think about is I'm imagining the indigenous people coming across these who've prints like that because there's nothing in Australia. You've got to think they're the biggest animals running around in Australia would like Kangaroos, dude, I'd have these little toad legs.

Speaker 1:          02:12:55       And then they come across these massive prints for the first time that had just devastated their, the last drink and hall before they move onto the next place. Crazy stories in this book. So there's no way to dig down deeper to restart the. Well, I guess. No, I guess at that point yet. So you're already so dehydrated, but you're walking to a point that you think that there's water because you build a well and then there's not anymore. Not that idea. Very much debt they would've given up because they are hottie people. But whatever they tried to do obviously wasn't enough fucking white people know. Isn't that horrible story why people ruin everything?

Speaker 3:          02:13:31       I hate to say we've done a lot of good thought wrong of white people.

Speaker 1:          02:13:36       Yeah. But, but so I see the mystery behind fucking just walking into the center, even though it's a horrible mystery to go through, you know? That's what I mean. At least a haven has done at the Di in, in the middle of Australia thinking I'm going to go when they fish and there's an inland ocean in somewhere and they never come across it. You're at the middle of the desert, but at the same time it takes away from all the mystery in life at it

Speaker 3:          02:13:58       things way different than me because you have that wanderlust. Got You. Have that. I want to go out and find the hidden things. I don't have any of that shit. Yeah. I'm like, okay, where's the water? No, no, no, no. Show me on a map. Where's the water? Okay. Where? What? What kind of equipment do we need? What are we doing? Do we have backup gun? We get charged like you and I are very different in that regard. I have no desire to go to uncharted

Speaker 1:          02:14:24       towards Reiki. It's not. The risk that's appealing was just a wanderlust. It must be. Just put your finger on that last. That cave system that you put a picture up of before that I took photos of a lot of people have asked like where is that? But for me personally, I'd like to keep that undocumented because it seems once a place is known as no different than a good fishing or hunting spot, it gets fucking ruined. And that cave system, for starters, it's not up to me because you know, that'd be up to the traditional owners to want to put that out there for people to go and look at it. It's not up to me, so I can't share that information. But for me personally, I don't want that to be documented because I know as soon as it's documented, robish will shop there. Some decades will shop there and spray paint or scribble on rule one or some shit like that. Some places are better off on undocumented.

Speaker 3:          02:15:21       Well we, the human race has got to evolve past that and that's a big order. Obviously that's a very tall order. But God, we've got to evolve past

Speaker 1:          02:15:29       set a fucking white dude. There's good people and bad people for the donut man.

Speaker 3:          02:15:34       Right? But I think there's more good people now than ever before. Definitely more informed people now where before we just got to keep progressing along the same lines. And I think that that progress is accelerating. And I would just hope that more people in the future would have more appreciation for what that is, is just like this incredible historical resource. Are you seeing these mean we're talking about 65,000 years of people in this area and who knows how old those paintings. It could be thousands of years old, right? I mean, has anybody done leg or carbon dating on them? I'm sure there has been a bunch of. They find those in Texas sometimes from native Americans to find them in caves. Just find a cave system. And then you just encountered these pictures.

Speaker 1:          02:16:15       I was hunting in New Mexico. Uh, we, we saw, I tagged out and then like I didn't want the hunt and the hunt was done. Sorry, I didn't have any tags lift. I didn't want the experience to end, you know, that's why I say it's never ever been, you know, just killing an animal. It's about the whole adventure, the whole package. And uh, I was with an outfitter and the guides like, oh, you tagged out, what do you want to do? I'm like, well, let's go explore it and go walk. And steel and just take photos of the country, saw it or whatever. Um, you put that all up on your blog to write it in a magazine, a magazine that one on there. Read that actually it might be on both sides. Dot Com. I think I did a live one anyway. Go up on top of these Mesa and uh, you can see these rock a, like a huge rock and new shakes which used to be like the Anasazi Indians.

Speaker 1:          02:17:02       That's how I used to have their housing and stuff like that. Perfect spot right up high. Looking down onto these big meadows. Like it would've been the perfect place to if other tribes were coming in, you'd be able to say them. And if any animals working for moving through there, you'd be able to see them just the perfect spot. And we'd get up there. And as I get to the top, the first thing you find is a bunch of pottery. And uh, the Anasazi had a certain color, I think it was the white with the black writing on the pottery. And the Navajos had the orange with the white writing on the pottery and there's both types sitting in this area, so I don't know if there's a bit of confusion or maybe I'm lacking a bit of information there, but as far as I've looked into those, the Anasazi Indians and it's the hallway or, and they liked this, must've been some major.

Speaker 1:          02:17:47       Saw it dude. I found a perfect stone. Broadhead just sitting right there on a rock and it just rained. So everything was clean. Everything was clean. I picked it up and like my mind boggled straight away. Like why, how did this get here? Who held it? Did they shoot it? Who Shop? And the history behind it. And um, then so we kept walking around. I found a full ax head dude. Like obviously the team has gone off the ax because it's been there for so long. The team has just brought it, the nothing. The ax hates sitting there. Perfect. We ended up finding three ax heads, uh, Indian pendant, you know, if the perfect little hole like scribed in it. And just like crazy. Dude. Did you bring that bag with you because it was privately handles. I was able to take it. You take a photo, the of the uh, broadhead. Yep. Good. All that document. Those fascinate me. I was nearly going to give you the broadest. I'm like, that's taken it to fucking deserve it. You can add the buffalo skull. I shed a tear. Just pot with that buffalo skull and buffalo skills. It doesn't matter. They will mean something to Bert was saying today. He killed the dog.

Speaker 1:          02:19:10       The cat things freaks people out about Australia. That dog freaks people out as well, but it's no different than shooting a coyote here a problem. Animal dingoes will one of the first. They believe one of the first introduced species in Australia and it come with the indigenous population at some point. Oh, so they came with

Speaker 2:          02:19:28       indigenous people? Yup. So the indigenous people out there, wild dogs is Dingo. Sorry, is most of them aren't dingoes anymore because there's been a wild dog population that's sort of peppered through there as well. Dingoes and w and normal dogs, like a domestic dog that's gone wild had now in a bread and I, I'm pretty sure that any place you can find a purebred Dingo now is on Fraser Island in Australia. They've got a policy or regulations that is not allowed to be any domestic animals taken to the island and also the population stayed pure. Oh Wow. So if you live there, you can't have a dog. I don't think he can live on the island at all. Oh yeah. It's one of those things. Yeah. Kind of weird rules about wade roses that you can't hunt anything native. That's very strange to me that they wouldn't just have to. But you have. Kangaroos are on some of our currency, so they're like our icon. So imagine eight annual Bodega, like eight and year American icon. So that's one way to look at it by chicken, but we kind of need a kid news all frigging wombats or anything like that? No, not that I'd probably want to, but people do eat kangaroo though. That's why I'm confused. And the indigenous cancer, Dingo big, good looking dog. She will, you know, that'd be Fraser Island dog. There you go. So that's a look at them on the lake.

Speaker 2:          02:20:51       It's a beautiful dog that feels like you could take that thing as a puppy and raise it. There's, I've got a buddy who had one habit, goatees little girl, like try and grab these little go when he had it as a puppy or not just a wild one that come into the tent and tried to grab him ripping a wallet down there. So what happened? Um, he ended up killing the dog. He founded the next morning and not shooting it was a wall Dingo, but Dingo ate my baby and I some truth to that. Oh yeah. I've seen. How should they go fishing? Jesus Christ while eating a shark on a beach, that theft fucking cool photo as a gangster ass dog when it got a lot of meat. I wonder if someone actually call it the shark. And that's another thing that people are freaking out about it here in America.

Speaker 2:          02:21:45       It's most recent freakouts people fishing and catching sharks. Simon and strike that. It used to be able to buy Maaco Shark. It was very common for most flake and the stuff that you bond shock, you know, like when you buy like a bad bit of fish or something like that from one of them quick type wise it does fish and chips. Then most of that's actually flight, which is just a shock really? Yeah. Yeah. No, no, no. Specific Australia? No, I probably hate to. Do you think they're serving a lot of tapes of him and there's a ton of them that get into next net. That's where they go really taste good. I've eaten Maaco sharp before and is delicious. And electric swordfish. It's the same as anything. As long as we're not freaking killing a male. Well, you know what happens is people find out that a lot of people are killing them for Finn's.

Speaker 2:          02:22:34       Okay. Warning your fish and chips could actually be shark. Damn a bad motherfucker. Boy, this is drying last nine Bogan. Okay. Hey, good fit rod into Australia last night. Like bogus. Cashed up. Bogans. Did you tell me that? You might have told me that expression. Kim talking smack far so, um, but I think what happened was over here the people found out about how many sharks get killed for the fins shark fin soup and there was a big campaign to alert people about it. And, and so then the people that have just barely a peripheral awareness of conservation and fishing and, and animal life, then they started going to kill sharks. Sharks. They're assholes. Meanwhile they're eating a cod. Exactly. Having some salmon for lunch on the salad. Would you eat this fish? A shark called the dog fish makes it tasty. Taco. Yeah. I need to fuck out of a dog.

Speaker 2:          02:23:31       Fish me. It's still a fish. I mean, it's not efficient shark, but I just don't understand why people would differentiate between that. And tonight. How about you assholes that really loves Sushi. Back the fuck off of the tuna because they're killing all the Goddamn tuna. There's probably more sharks. There are tuna. They. Yeah. There's some pretty strict regulations in Australia. The whole world needs to know. There's some regulations that have come into the northern territory of Australia now because you can actually shoot a magpie geese with a bow and arrow. So there's magpie geese and introduced turkeys like what you guys have here in the states, they're the only birds that you can shoot with a bone. Our window Australia. Oh really? So they just brought in a season for magpie geese, which really restricts a lot of the. Honda's taken too many, which is fine.

Speaker 2:          02:24:17       I think that that's probably not a bad thing, but then these birds fly to other countries where there's no restrictions at all and they just fucking get hammered. Dude. So it's like we're doing everything we can on our part, but I just go somewhere else and get slower than any line. Well you don't understand. No issues with the shocks as well. Like they've, there's a few spaces that are highly protected in Australia but they swim abroad and they fair game for anyone but eats great whites though right now that I know of, but I guess people would if they were starved, I would for sure. I mean, it's probably just fish tastes pretty good. I don't think that gave up too fucking easy. That's another monster live and monster dual. Yeah. Legit monster. Yeah. There was an instance in San Diego a few years back were these bunch of these people were training for a triathlon and they were swimming in the ocean and one out of nowhere.

Speaker 2:          02:25:08       I just came and cut this guy and half of everybody else just bit him right at the waist. This scary dude shot them right in half chomp besides conserving their live shark. Meat can be terribly unhealthy. According to CNN report from nearly 20 years ago, the mercury levels in sharks can cause coordination, loss blindness, and even deaths. Scientists think that sharks accumulate mercury in their body because they eat many smaller fish. That's interesting. Why you shouldn't eat shark meat. It doesn't and have a lot of mercury in it as well. I don't know. They say, I don't like to eat Marlin, you know, but I've heard Marlin's good. I think a lot of those big fish, especially the prey to the ones a full of mercury. Makes Sense. Yeah, I mean it's like predators in general have a lot of weird things going on with their body if you eat them, you know like mountain lions can be tricky.

Speaker 2:          02:25:59       GNOSIS interesting study like a, it says at the top of the article, an estimated 100 million sharks are killed each year to feed consumer demand and then the study came from a report of a 124 sharks that were tested in. One third of them came in with mercury levels that were over FDA action level of one part per million. So 100 million sharks every year. One hundred and 24 had a third of those were problematic. So 30 sharks were problematic or so 40 out of how many. But they didn't test that many though, right? I mean they didn't test 100 million. The tests at 140 were bad. Ooh, that's not good. That's not good. It's real bad you think? Yeah, that's terrible. Doesn't say maybe they were all one area too. They could have came out of one shitty maybe area. And I've told this story 100 times, but I'll say it again just quickly. I had arsenic in my body from when I did a blood test and he said, what are you eating? And I said, I eat a lot of sardines, and the guy said, back off the sardines, we'll try it again in a couple of weeks. And the arsenic was gone. Eating two cans of Sardines Day. I love sardines. I don't know why I like sardines on. Totally love them. They're great.

Speaker 2:          02:27:09       Came back road swordfish. Yep. Oh, do not eat shark swordfish. King Mackerel or tile fish. Because they contain high levels of mercury. I've heard that about tune as well. I don't know those certain areas. Some tuna apparently contains high levels of mercury were assholes. I was reading something about fucking crabs. I put it up on my twitter that crabs are getting Prozac in the water from human beings like because somebody fucking nut bags are on Prozac that it's getting into the oceans through runoff and it's affecting crab behavior and it's making crabs reckless. And I already saved pretty fucking reckless. No, they're bugs. Right? But apparently it's making the reckless area. It goes. Roseanne, puts crabs in a mood to take deadly risks. Shit that with me and Andrew Equals. I mean what the fuck? I mean, how crazy is the human race where we are giving PROZAC inadvertently to fucking crabs and they're at a risk. Apparently they're worried about the population dying off or at least being affected. These crabs

Speaker 3:          02:28:22       are doing reckless things and it's going to cause them to get preyed upon or die. What the fuck man? Shit, crap brains on Ssri. But what is that word? How do you say that word? Jamie flew. Locks is a class of antidepressant called SSRI or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, meaning that indirectly boosie amount of mood altering serotonin available to the brain. It's designed to affect people's brains in a way that can alleviate depressive symptoms. But past research has shown that when a person's flew ox, team filled, waste enters, flew their shit and Piss, and there's the waterways. It can alter the shores, crabs, reproductive molting, and digestive behaviors and may even cause the crabs to abandon their nocturnal schedule according to the paper. Wow.

Speaker 2:          02:29:13       Humans. And we're, well, we're definitely a mess. A definitely. Speaking of that. Let's get outta here and go get something to eat. Yeah, that sounds awesome. I feel like I need to get you to say that you come into Australia, come to Australia eventually. I'll do some shit. Go to a nice restaurant, have dinner, come hunting deer killed by browns to ask you one fucking protect you. If if I die in everybody who likes this podcast, no longer gets a podcast, there'll be fucking mad at you. But bringing me to Australia, it'll be leather skin mocking. Worth. It takes forever to eat. You need to come meet you and Cam. Alright, we'll work something out. Maybe just say go to Hawaii and shoot axis deer resort. Come on, land hunt. Buffalo sounds terrible. No, listen to what nick buff paste together. Very authentic, getting chased by salt water crocodiles and watch brown snakes slithering into our camp. Probably like, thanks for having me on the challenge. And brother always. Jamie, Adam Green Tree. Ladies and gentlemen. Uh, Adam.green tree on instagram. And a first.man dot image. Adam, get it first man. Adam and Eve cain was wearing a shirt that I think she's adorable. That's adorable. All right. Thanks brother. Appreciate it, but it's fun.
