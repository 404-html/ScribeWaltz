Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Sure.

Speaker 2:          00:00:02       Are we live? Oh my goodness. Rich Roll. Ladies and gentlemen. How are you buddy? Good to see Ya. What's cracking? Happy to be here, man. I'm drinking green juice interview. I hope that's in my honor. Sort of. I drink it every day, but appreciate that helps. Where'd you pick that up? Juicy lady. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know what that is? I do. I go there all the time. I love that place. I wish I changed the name of it, but a juicy ladies. I don't know why it's. I think a lady owns it. Yeah. Now she's cool. Actually. I like it, but yeah, the food there is pretty good. It's a little sexual. Yeah. The name or is it an assault of your masculinity? No, no. I'm cool with that, but some weaker men might have an issue. You have to be selfish. You have to be strong enough to go in there and order Vegan food. They do, but they make a good green juice. Yeah. They make a lot of good stuff there. It's a good spot where there's more and more of those places that are opening up. If Mcdonald's is going to offer a Kale shake, no way.

Speaker 2:          00:00:56       That's changing though. Well, something's working well. We're getting nutrients in their body. It's crazy. Starbucks. Starbucks has what? Get the fuck out. I didn't know that. Yeah, get the fuck Outta here. Evo Green things. It makes it up with a yogurt and fresh Kale if you want it to, but why would they put yogurt in it? Because it makes it a smoother start. Starbucks makes us. Well, you know the market. The market will dictate it if people want. It started like when you talk about conspiracy theories with evil corporations, it's like they're responding to what people want. You know? That is true. People want it. They're going to start making it. That's the whole conspiracy with really shitty television shows to like people like men. They're trying to make us dumb. Nope. Already dumb like you have to do is look at the ratings and see what people are actually watching it and they're responding to that.

Speaker 2:          00:01:45       Well, people are tired. They get home from work, they're exhausted. They don't want to watch cosmos or some of them do. I do, but some people just want to, they just want to zone out and watch honey booboo or I don't think that's right anymore. There's always a new one. But yeah, we uh, we got rid of our TVS. Yeah, like are you like a year ago? But believe me, I did not want to do. It was not my idea. I was uh, I was quite vociferous in opposing that idea. That was my wife's idea. But actually it's just like anything else you adjust to it. I mean I still watch Netflix and I watch the shows I like to watch and now I don't, I don't miss it. And I have total, like when I've been traveling a lot and you know, when you're in hotel rooms, he turned the TV on and I have a zero tolerance policy for commercials now. Like I'm like really, you know, and I just turned the TV off and go back online. Yeah, commercials are fucking brutal. Whoever invented the idea of stopping a show every 15 minutes for three minutes or whatever the hell it is for commercials. That's awful. Well, it's crazy how you acclimate to that because as a kid, you know, think about how many hours of your life, you know, we're just basically watching commercials. Well, you know what happened though, dvrs, dvrs made commercials really stupid.

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       That's still. I mean we're about the same age, right? So that's still a recent development in our life. You know, most of our formative years was terrible television commercials. Yeah. I got my first vo in the early two thousands. It was like a standalone unit that hooked up to direct TV. I think it was like, I want to say like 2003 or something like that. And I was like, this is amazing. You can pause the TV now. You can pause it and go take a leak. You could record things. You could find search things and have them on a schedule. Because I fucking. I had probably 10 vcrs in my life and never figured out how to record one of those pitches. This flashing 12:00, I'd never scheduled one of them. I never had one of them scheduled, unlike anybody figured that out. Some people must have.

Speaker 4:          00:03:49       It's cool how it's changing, I mean, you know, to see how, how you know, what's going on with Netflix and Amazon and all that kind of stuff. And, and most recently what Tim Ferriss has done with his show, have you followed that at all? Which was so, so tim had a show called the Tim Ferriss experiment in an era on. I can't remember what. Yeah, it was, uh, it was, uh, it was like a, another channel that was part of the CNN headline news or it wasn't headline news where it was something like that. It went under. Right. And so his show was, I don't know how many episodes had aired, but certainly not the entire 13, you know, of the season. And then it was just, you know, how it is an entertainment like you're just done, right. They own the show. And even though they were all taped and locked in and completed, nobody had seen them and somehow he was able to get, get his show back and he, he, I dunno, you know, through loitering or what have you. And uh, bought the rights back, got his show and cut a deal with itunes and it's premiered on itunes this past week and I think it's like the top ranked TV show on itunes

Speaker 3:          00:04:52       now you can watch the TV show rankings though, or just like their podcast rankings, you know. Well, who knows how the, it knows that algorithm works well. It does. It's definitely not based on the number of downloads. No, it's definitely not. It's based on new, like it, it knew it takes precedent, new subscribers and, and also uh, comments. So like Chelsea Peretti had the number one podcast in the country and she hadn't even released an episode yet. Right. So zero had been downloaded and they also put subscribed.

Speaker 4:          00:05:23       They overinflate new shows. Someone, somebody premiers a show with one or two episodes that it's like super high up for awhile before it settles into where it should be.

Speaker 3:          00:05:34       I think that's good because it doesn't keep anybody from downloading other shows that are already popular. And it does give new shows like a window. But like, you'll see people, I'm number one, like you'll see like these bright like come on man. Like do you know what that means? What is it? What are your numbers? How many downloads? EA? Definitely not number one there. It's weird. The rankings is weird. It was all over the, like my show

Speaker 5:          00:05:58       this week. Uh, it's got a banner on the top carousel of Itunes, on the itunes homepage for podcasts. So my numbers went way up this week and overall rankings, but I know that's not real. You know, it'll settle back down and then we will. But it won't, you know, it will, but it'll build, you know, I remember when we first started doing this podcast, I don't know what our downloads were. There were, there were nothing though. It was like, you know, a few thousand here or there. And then one day it was like, oh, we're getting a million downloads a month. What? A million. And now it's somewhere around 14 million. Is it really? Yeah. What's your, what's your average download per show? You can you talk about that ends? It depends on the show, but there's all the different things. There's Itunes, then there's the raw mp3 that you can download there, stitcher, which is really hard to track.

Speaker 5:          00:06:48       Yeah. You don't know what's going on. Stitcher only takes one. They'll give you numbers, but you know, chase it down to what they do is stitcher is an application for cell phones that allows, they take a podcast and they below are the bit rate and make it a much smaller file and then they, so they only download one episode, but then it gets distributed through their system, you know, I don't know how many times. So then there's that. Then there's Ustream, which is a few thousand usually. Um, and then there's youtube, which is tens if not hundreds of thousands, usually hundreds of thousands. And then, um, it's never tens of thousands. Um, and then, um, vimeo. So altogether it's usually around a billion an episode depending on the episode. Crazy. Yeah. It could be more crazy numbers, you know, powerful jewelry. Well, it's just a number thing.

Speaker 5:          00:07:42       Just you keep doing it. Have interesting people like rich roll. It isn't, gentlemen, have interesting people on have funny conversations, fun conversations, and just keep doing it and it built. I just listened to your episode with Sam Harris from the other day and it's just he. That guy is captivating. Yeah. He's an interesting dude. He's a very intelligent, very cool guy. I want to get him together with Abby Martin though. I. She's got down the same room. I'm sure your phone rang from her after that show. I got a few text messages. We went back and forth. She's my friend. I'm very good friends with her and I'm good friends with Sam too. I like both of them. Well, Sam's got a next level brain. Yeah. He's very smart. Whether you agree with him or not, he has an incredible acuity to present an argument and support it and communicate it in a very clear and calm way.

Speaker 5:          00:08:33       He's also very honest, you know, like, uh, if he's communicating and argument he is not doing it to be deceptive. These are his actual feelings and thoughts and agree with them or not agreeing with them. This is his point of view and uh, as, as hard as, you know, I mean, I respect both of them very much. I, I, I'm in the middle between both as well. I'm not necessarily 100 percent her side. I'm not necessarily hundred percent his side. Um, it's, it's, it's, uh, you know, you're talking about death and war and uh, anytime you can find any way to minimize or trivialize that, it's easily open for argument, open for criticism. So that's where I see, I see her point of view, but I also see his point of view. It's a lot of fucking crazy people in the world. What a awful, terrible people.

Speaker 5:          00:09:18       There's a lot of really dangerous ideologies that are being passed around and have been passed around for a long time. And the people that are embedded in these ideologies are married to them. They're very, very committed to it. And you know, I see his point of view. He knows what he's talking about and to shade. So it's, it's crazy, you know. Well, a couple things. I mean, first of all, I'm always impressed with how you kind of navigate the treacherous waters of having guests on that you may disagree with, which may beat me today, I don't know, but you know, sort of yell, you'll have people with different point of view, sometimes extreme, sometimes not, uh, and, and the way that you kind of have to gracefully like as a podcast. So it's myself, that's always a challenge, you know, like how do you, um, have a respectful, engaging conversation, um, but also make sure that you're asking the right questions so that you're not just people pleasing.

Speaker 5:          00:10:07       Well, I don't think there's anything wrong with disagreeing with someone, you know, and I don't think there's anything wrong with having a pleasant conversation with someone whose views you don't share. I think two people can be diametrically opposed on certain issues, but still be nice to each other. I don't think there's anything wrong with that. And I think when I talked to someone who doesn't share my opinions or has differing opinions, I tried to relax whatever part of me wants to argue with that and just try to figure out what is it, where they come in from, you know, where's, what's their point of view based on is it logical, is it emotional, is it objective, is it non, where, where were they at, you know? And also I like to play, like sometimes people say you have a, you asked this, that. And sometimes I'll ask people things that I don't even, I don't even believe what I'm saying, what I'm, what I'm trying to do is either play devil's advocate or argue the counterpoint just to try to figure out where they're at and try to cover all the bases.

Speaker 5:          00:11:09       Because especially when it comes to a controversial issue, you know, you want, you want to explore not just where a person's at, like what, what they're trying to say, but how did they come to that conclusion? Right. And in the case of Sam, I mean, he's traveled extensively. He has firsthand experience with all these kinds of people. Um, so he has a basis from where, you know, for where he's coming from. A, I was actually a funny story about him. I've never met him, I don't know him, but we were classmates. We were in the same freshman class in college at Stanford and uh, and I don't, like I said I don't know him, but we have mutual friends in common so a couple of guys that I'm close with that he's still close with and I was talking to one of them recently and you just said we were talking about Sam because he's blown up and he's everywhere and he's so insight guy straighten out.

Speaker 5:          00:12:01       And uh, he was telling me that in some freshmen, I don't know if it was a freshman English class or something like that, that, that he, that Sam just distinguished himself immediately, like by challenging the professor and just everybody knew that he was on a nother level intellectually at a, at a young age. Well, it's got to be very difficult if you're in college and you're taking classes from a person that you think is a dumb ass, which does happen. Right, right. I mean, I had it happen in college. I can clearly remember. I forgot what class it was in, but I can clearly remember going, oh, all right, well now I have to just think only of the information, the, the actual numbers and the data that's being presented in this class and ignore this person's opinion because there are a fucking idiot. It was, I believe it was either a philosophy class or a psychology class.

Speaker 5:          00:12:53       I don't remember the exact circumstance, but I remember thinking like, Oh, this is a real issue. And then as I got older and I started paying attention to some of the things that get taught in school and some of the like very rigid ideologies. It's some people especially like really super lefties like to impose on students and some of the ideas they tried to impose on students are very. It's a very subjective ideas. You know, very, very much personal opinions. They get stuffed into kids' heads and then it becomes an issue of whether or not you know whether or not you want that in your head. Whether or not. I mean, you're going to get an a in this class if you disagree with this guy, but still present good arguments or you're going to have to go along with the way this person is trying to portray the world in order to be graded accordingly.

Speaker 5:          00:13:39       I don't think critical thought is really taught to the extent that it should be in young people. You know, we're on this. Our education system is about, you know, getting through as much information as possible and standardized testing and you know, getting good grades and all that kind of thing and you know, the idea that you should be questioning the ideas that are presented to you is really not something that is part of that world to the extent that I think it should be. I agree. And I also think that there's very little being taught, especially at a high school level of how to think and not just like, this is mathematics, this is the way you calculate things. This is, these are the facts of history that we're aware of instead of how do you deal with problems, how do you address interpersonal relationships?

Speaker 5:          00:14:33       How do you, how do you look at yourself objectives? Do you ever step back and try to look at yourself the way maybe someone else would and judge yourself and your own actions instead of protecting yourself with your ego and all those things that people do like almost naturally to protect themselves, really wind up being traps. It really wind up fucking you up and you have to kind of clean up that mess as you get older. Well, I mean, I guess that's supposed to be on the parents. You know what I mean? They don't do it either like life skills. What about just, you know, learning how to navigate this crazy world that we're living in, you know, about learning how to eat. For me, the most important thing, you know, as a parents, it's like I want my kids to be excited about life and to be excited about something, to figure out a way to be passionate about something because if they have that motor, that drive, that is half the game right there.

Speaker 5:          00:15:33       And then also to have that ability to critically, you know, to want to learn the desire to learn as much more important than whatever you're learning. Yeah. So how do you make your kid enthusiastic about that? Especially when they're getting beaten down, you've got to find whatever it is that they're drawn to. Right? Yeah. So you expose them to a lot of things and then when they find something that they kind of gravitate towards your job is to support that. At least that's how I see it. Yeah. And then give them the opportunity to switch gears to. I remember when I was a kid I would be into a lot of different things and my parents would always be like super resistant. If I got into something else, they'd be like, well what about the other thing that you do? When I'm like, well I want to do this now.

Speaker 5:          00:16:14       Stop fucking with me. What were you into? Well, initially I was really into art. You're crazy drawer. That's what I used to do. Yeah, all the all day long. When I was really young, I was A. I wanted to be a comic book illustrator, so I used to draw a lot and then um, when I was in my teenage years I discovered martial arts and that's all I wanted to do. And my parents were like, why do you want to do that? Like, why are you doing that when you used to do this? I'm like, because that's what I liked. Now can, I just liked it. And they said that presupposes that you have to make a choice between two things. Like why do you have to define yourself by one of those? Well, why couldn't you be my dad? What happened? Where were you when my mom was hot?

Speaker 5:          00:16:57       Yeah, I think there's, um, you know, it's, a lot of it is people, you know, they're raising their kids, they just want the best for their kids. They just maybe don't have the best ideas, you know, they don't necessarily know. And it's also like, I mean, I was born in 1967, so my parents were basically cave people. I mean, let's be realistic, like people that were, if you're, if you're born in [inaudible] 67, that means your parents were. My parents were born in [inaudible] 47, right? My mom was like 20 when she had me. So w 1947. That's fucking world war two. Dude, that means that her parents were born during World War One. My, her parents came over on the boat from Italy. It's, they're savages. They're basically, they might as well be Magellan, right? Well there too. I mean, I was born in [inaudible] 66,

Speaker 4:          00:17:50       so same, same basic idea. My parents, you know, they're, they're too old to have been part of kind of sixties subculture. Um, so they kind of missed that part but too young to kind of be seventies vibe also. So there's sort of a weird like light dusting of mad men era, you know, and they're great people. I love my parents, you know, their, their, their fans and they did the best job that they could raising me and work clothes and all that kind of stuff. But, but they live, you know, they don't understand. They have a, they have a challenge trying to understand like what I'm doing now. Really. They try. Yeah. Like, and they're happy that I'm, that I'm happy, but it's very, you know, they're coming from a generation where, you know, look, I grew up in a really education focused household and I tried to my best to live up to that and to some extent I succeeded at that.

Speaker 4:          00:18:42       But the whole idea was premised on this myth of the American dream, you know, study hard, get into the best school, get into the best graduate school, get the best job you can, you know, work hard and like do as you're told and ascend the ladder and the implicit promise, you know, at the end of that rainbow of course is not only, you know, sort of security and prosperity but happiness. Yeah. And for me, I chased that without ever really without those critical thinking skills because I never really intuited that I was just so focused on the prize and I'm very disciplined and determined and but I wasn't able to step outside the box and look at it analytically in comparison to, you know, what would be best for me. Like I never said, what do I want? It was just, this is what you do, this is how you get ahead. This is how you have a good life.

Speaker 3:          00:19:32       I think there's also their fault. Sure. No, it's definitely not their fault. The amount of information that they had available to them back then comparison to what we have today is unbelievably different now. There's so much more information now and I think there's also a very. There's a real lack of understanding of the landscape of the race you're in. Like everybody wants to think of it as a race is the rat race. But if you look, if you could get an aerial view of the actual race from birth to death, from the time you're born to the time you leave this planet. And look at it as like you're looking into formula one race track and you could actually see the course. You'd be like, Oh fucking Jesus Christ. What am I doing here? I'm wasting all my time doing shit. I don't want to do this. Race is not very long. This race is going to end like this is a fuck. I thought it. I thought there was like a happiness truck somewhere along the line that I was going to refuel with and change my tires when I get my phd.

Speaker 4:          00:20:29       It's the idea that you're going to arrive at some point or that you're going to land in this destination that is called success or happiness. And when you get to our age, you realize that that's just. That's an illusion, right? It just continues. And you start to think about what your life means. What do you stand for and what is your legacy? You know, we're approaching 50. It's like, what do you know if I die today, what was, what did I, what did I leave in my wake?

Speaker 3:          00:20:54       Well, even that, look, the bottom line is whatever you leave, it's not gonna matter because it's going to matter to some people that you know and they're going to leave to. Everyone's going to leave, but are you enjoying this? Are you enjoying the moment? Everyone's working towards this ultimate like the retirement years, the golden ears like you're fucking almost dead when those years come like those little you see those people holding hands and walking along, they barely can walk. Their knees hurt. They're all fucked up like that's not what you work for. You don't work towards this ultimate point where you don't do anything anymore and that's ridiculous. The what you should work towards is doing what you enjoy doing right now and enjoying your life right now, enjoying your friends right now, enjoying whatever hobbies you like to pursue. Whatever love affairs and friendships and all that stuff is what life is.

Speaker 3:          00:21:47       Life is the moment being in the moment and we somehow have turned it into this, this weird journey to have a very specific point, specific points of high school graduation, college graduation, but good job marriage, children, we have all these like milestones that are supposed to impart happiness in this race and they they're not real. They're social constructs and we've. We've created these social constructs and we've fed into them and pass them down from generation to generation without anybody stepping back and going, well, who set this up? Who set up? Who set up graduate school? Who said it? Who set up? Who set up common core? Who? Who are these people like, why? Why is, why is it this way with this? We're just biological organisms trying to have as much happiness and good feeling while we're here is we can. I feel like that's

Speaker 4:          00:22:43       changing though. I think that if you talk to somebody who's in their twenties, you know the idea that you would work a corporate job and stay in that job for your career and collect your pension and then write out your sixties and seventies playing golf is a foreign concept to a young person. Whereas that was the kind of paradigm, right? For our parents' generation and when you look at the advent of the Internet and what that provides and allows you see this explosion in lifestyle careers where you're not wed to a geographic location. We live in a kind of subcontractor economy where people are more project based than, than you know, working for the big corporation or the plants and certainly all that stuff exists on some level but not to the extent that it, that it used to. And I think that's super interesting and I think that allows people to engage in critical thinking and a new and different way.

Speaker 4:          00:23:36       And I think you see young people who are asking themselves those very questions like, what do I want to do? What makes me happy with that can come entitlement. And that's why I think the millennials get a get a bad rap for that, but at the same time I think that they are much more engaged in trying to grapple with who they are and what it is that, you know, they're passionate about expressing and then finding a way to tap into the economy somehow so that they can contribute and make a living doing that. And I think that that's really cool to watch unfold.

Speaker 3:          00:24:08       I agree. And I think that the idea that millennials are entitled, I think every young kid has a distorted perception of the world that we live in and in every generation, probably less so to know they're going to,

Speaker 4:          00:24:22       they're going to be in some, probably not on a podcast, but in some form of media, you know, 20 years from now talking about how, you know, you and I are out to lunch. I mean that's the natural order of things, but how are priorities and how we raise them, who is myopic in some way. Sure. I'm sure. Yeah, they'll fill, they'll figure it out. They'll get it better than we're doing it well with the acceleration of technology. I mean, who knows where things are going to be. We just can't foresee what the, what that world would look like.

Speaker 3:          00:24:48       Yeah. Human beings might be obsolete in 20 years. Did you listen to the last hour of the Sam Harris' podcast? Artificial intelligence?

Speaker 4:          00:24:55       No. I got into the first. I think I. I didn't make it through the end of it the last hour and keeps me up at night. Did you see there's a movie called x mock and I'm going to see it tonight. So interesting. Half in. It's, it's, it's haunting. It's very well done. It's a very small, very contained independent movie, but it's so well executed and you just leave like with a lot to think about.

Speaker 3:          00:25:22       There's a lot to think about, period. You know, I had a long sit down with Ray Kurzweil and I interviewed him for the Scifi show that I did and we went back and forth over the possibilities of this new era that we're entering into. We were, we went to, excuse me, this global 20, 45 initiative. Yeah. That they were having a New York City where all the futurists got together and they were all comparing notes and talking about the different possibilities for not just artificial intelligence, but symbiotic relationships with computers, downloading consciousness into databases and all this kind of crazy shit. And you walk away thinking like, I don't, I don't know if anybody knows where this is going and it's not going to stop. There's going to be continual innovation until we reach some, some event, horizon of science, some, some point of no return, you know, some what they call ultimate novelty point. That's what Terence Mckenna used to call it. You know, this ultimate novelty point and it's probably gonna happen within our lifetime. It's probably going to have within the next 20 or 30 years. You think it's going to happen that soon? I mean, I'm just guessing it's all, it's total guessing. Well, there's always the issue of natural disasters. Any real natural disaster would throw a massive hiccup into any plans

Speaker 5:          00:26:44       that anyone has. I mean, if all we'd need is yellowstone to blow and it would set back civilization to three generations easily, if not forever. Well, how about just California running out of water? I think if we can get oil from Saudi Arabia, how the fuck can we not get water from Antarctica that everybody's whining about those, those ice caps melting, just stick a fucking big pipe on those pitches and run them down to the almond fields? Well, you know what's weird, what's weird is, uh, is how you would think, like if you didn't know better, you would think how hard can it be to desalinate the ocean? That's got to be elementary school chemistry, right? But it's interesting that it's so difficult that the best minds are having such a hard time figuring that out and it's almost like the universe has rigged it that way because human beings are such idiots that if they made it easy, our oceans would be dry deserts right now because we can't help ourselves.

Speaker 5:          00:27:42       We cannot help ourselves. And that is the same, you know, compulsion that is propelling technology forward and will ultimately catapult us into this ai universe that's going to destroy us. I, yeah, I think whatever it is, why we find that funny is weird, right? I know, but it is true. If we could fucking dry out the ocean, we would have done it a long time ago. Those houses in Malibu who were dog shit. It's about $20,000,000 houses and that's not really a $20,000,000 house. It's just $20,000,000 because it's right there on the water. Yeah. That house would be worth fuck all because there would be like a few hundred yards of dirt in front of your house now. I mean how hard can it be to separate salt from water? Apparently. It's pretty hard. Yeah. Well, you know, they just opened up a large, a desalination plant in San Diego.

Speaker 5:          00:28:32       I heard about that. It's been over a billion dollars in this fucker. And then give it a run. Right. I just think it's a matter of time. I mean they, it's absolutely possible to take salt out of water. So I don't think that there's been as much incentive in the past as there is now and now that California has gone on this three year drought where we need 11 trillion gallons of water just to bring us back to normal. Wow. Well, it's, it's kind of emblematic of how we deal with problems because instead of trying to solve the problem that got us to this place, we're just looking for another source of water, right? It's sort of like taking, you know, taking Viagra to deal with the fact that you can't get a boner instead of looking at why it is you can't get a boner. Right? But I mean like you're, you're, you're dealing with the symptom. But there are deserts that didn't use to be deserts. I mean they're not because of humankind, because that's because of natural forces, right? So there is certainly one aspect of this that you can kind of point towards human beings, but the reality of the earth, the absolute reality of the earth is

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       climates change, oceans, law, the levels change. They always have an. Even if people didn't exist, you would have to deal with that. So is there any sound like a climate, but I'm definitely not. All I'm saying is we have this idea that once we're in a spot we should be able to stay in this spot, this spot, but there are spots in North America. First of all, like half of North America was covered in a mile of ice just 10,000 years ago. That's a fact and we have to deal with the fact that if we want to like set up a house and have. We only have five acres right here, well guess what? In 20 years for whatever reason, that might not be a good spot anymore and we have this idea that once we own property that that spot should be livable and ideal forever. And even if people didn't have anything to do with the climate, the climate will shift, change.

Speaker 3:          00:30:34       Things change. They always will change. We just have this really rigid idea of like where we should be able to put cities. I mean, when they keep finding these cities from like several thousand years ago, like did she ever see those concentric circles that they found in the water that they believe represents something very similar to what Atlanta was described as Spain outside of Spain, they've, they've found many, many underground cities where at some point in time the sea level change and it was long before carbon emissions, long before people were burning fossil fuels and using machines. It's just things shift. It's not to exonerate large corporations. Cole, our dependence on fossil fuel. That's a totally separate argument. I, I absolutely think all you have to do is look at La from a fucking airplane or worse. I got photos of Mexico City. Holy Shit. I was in Mexico City a couple months ago. We go to Mexico City in June. Again for the UFC, by the way, nicest people. Very, very friendly. Like you have this idea of Mexico City has been like horrible crime ridden, awful place. It's not. They're really nice people, but they just need better roads. God, they're fucking pollution is insane. You can taste it with your face, like when you get out of the airplane and you're like, whoa, this is crazy. And apparently it's better than it used to be, whether

Speaker 4:          00:31:53       it's Mexico City or la, you, you, you get this really kind of potent sense. You see the lights and the grid and you realize in the cars driving on the freeway and you realize it's just an organism. You know, there's these, these freeways are carrying cars are the arteries and the cars of the blood cells and we're feeding these cities like their organs in this larger unit that is interdependent. And it's interesting and I think it, it, you know, what you said about this idea of, of human beings and this idea that, that we think everything is static. I mean, I think that applies across the board. Like we think these cities will always be there, but we also think that our lives are, are somewhat static or that our relationships are static or our jobs or static or

Speaker 5:          00:32:40       our bank accounts. All of these things. Um, you know, we kind of agreed to in this social contract, but everything's fluid. Man. You know, everything is fluid and changing all the time on the micro level that leads to the macro and it's always going to be that way. And the also have to realize, I think we have to realize that one of the. I can't find these pictures of fucking. I think he posted that. I don't remember when you saw my instagram, but the point is that the only way a city got to be a city in the first place is things have changed radically. If you looked at where that city is, he was the Los Angeles where it is 400 years ago. There was absolutely nothing. You know, there's probably some native Americans and some Mexicans and some various people is back when it was Mexico and they were wandering around and doing their thing, but there was no.

Speaker 5:          00:33:28       There was no highways and sky rises and all that stuff was really, really recent. And in terms of the, the actual age of the earth, my God, it's like blink your eye and then all of a sudden cities are literally a blink of an eye and then everything's polluted. Everything's fucked. And Malibu Beach Front property is ridiculously overpriced, but in the history of this planet, has there ever been more change? Planetary early with the exception of natural disasters then there has been in the last 200 years when that sense aren't human beings as a kind of a natural where a virus on the planet. I mean, come on. That's called us. He called caught a virus with shoes. Yeah. It's interesting, mom. The opening of my. I'm a showtime special from like 2005. I argued that if you looked at the earth as a living organism and you're flying over and you saw la, you'd go, well that's cancer.

Speaker 5:          00:34:22       That's a growth. It's growing. It's out of control. It's stinks. It looks like it's a mess and it's getting bigger. We're greedy. Bastards were lacking that gene that prioritizes doing things sustainably. I think it's a huge problem. We're predatory. We're not symbiotic well. I think we have an an inescapable thirst for innovation. We want new and better things and we want progress. And of course short sighted in that regard. We are, we don't, we, we're unable to see the bigger picture. We don't have the foresight to, to make the responsible decision quite often, quite often. Well we, we, we err towards the size of prop started toward the side of profit and success and I oftentimes at the expense of, what is that you think? I mean other animals, other animals don't have that. Those, even though they do though they do beavers fuck up dams and they create dams and ruined rivers.

Speaker 5:          00:35:25       They don't make beaver city says they can now they could, they would get together and you know, if they can chew more huge giant dam and the Mississippi River, if they can agree with each other and they would do it, they don't give a fuck about, you know what I mean? Bears Shit. Wherever they walk, they don't, they don't clean up, they don't have like a certain spot where they put all their shit. They just don't have enough of an impact to really change the environment around them. But if they could, they would. Uh, I was listening to a radio lab podcast about the Galapagos Islands and it's very fascinating because they had to eradicate goats because these sailors had brought goats over, you know, way back in the day and they had brought goats and they put them on the island so that they could come back and eat them, like they would have a food source, but these goats just destroy everything in their path.

Speaker 5:          00:36:15       They just killed everything and they fucked it all up for the tortoise's. These poor tortoise's we're fucked. They didn't have any plant matter anymore because all these goats were coming along. So then they hired these people to kill the goats. So they flew over and helicopters and they gunned down the goats and then God started getting smart. So what they do was they would find goats. They would capture them, they would put radio collars on them, they would scare them. They would run over to where the other goats were, and then they would find where the goats were. They would kill all of them except the ones with the radio collars. And so they became what they called Judas goats. It's really fascinating how they set this up and then it got to a point where it was nothing but Judas goats. That's all that was left.

Speaker 5:          00:36:56       And so then, you know, they tried to reintroduce tortoise's is really, really fascinating. But the argument could be made that any animal acting purely in its own interest will ultimately fuck up everything around it. And it's one of the reasons why there's gotta be some kind of a balance, has got to be some kind of a balance between humans and the plants that we coexist with and the animals that we coexist with. And the same can be said with animals, like, you know, you can't have too many predators in an area. You can't have too many, uh, too many deer in an area. You're run into them with cars, they start starving to death. You get ticks and people start spreading the. They start spreading lyme disease and there's like humans and animals and they all act in their own interest. It's just we're the only ones that have finger.

Speaker 5:          00:37:44       Well, we can manipulate shit and change the environment in ways that no other animal could even come close to. There is an infinitely complex, you know, play that's going on and we insert ourselves into that and we have this reductionist idea, oh, if we insert this one thing, then that will fix the problem and what we don't do is really understand that, that the, the, the, the extent to which the Inter dependency of everything else comes into play. And I think that's true whether you're introducing an animal to an ecology to solve a problem and it creates a bigger problem or whether you're taking a drug to resolve one condition that has side effects or whether you're overly focused on one micronutrient or macronutrient as the solution to your health problem. You know, everything is more complicated than that. And I don't think that we kind of embrace a more holistic approach to, you know, whether it's our problems or our health or, or, or what have you.

Speaker 5:          00:38:41       That's another thing. It's not part of our wiring and it's not part of the, you know, the scientific method is by definition reductionist because you have to isolate variables and look at one thing at a time. It's true. That's very true. It's very true. Science in and of itself is reductionist and I think that there's also this weird hope that people have that have like, we fuck something up. Then our backs get against the wall. Then someone really smart will invent a solution and it'll all be better. You know that someone like right now is analyzing the who knows how many fucking trillions of pounds of plastic we've dumped into the ocean and they're trying to figure out some way to suck all that stuff out and turn it into some sort of fuel or some resource that we can capitalize on. That's those. Those, those kinds of thinking or that kind of thinking is real common.

Speaker 5:          00:39:32       We always think that eventually someone smarter, we'll figure out a way out of this mess. Elan Musk, it's going to solve it for all of us. Right, and I think that he might. I think that part of that is just the level of disenfranchisement that the average person has. Like we just don't feel like our vote counts. We don't feel like our dollar counts and like fuck it, you know, dancing with the stars is on and like I can't make a difference so I'm gonna throw my garbage out the window and who cares? I just found out the dancing with the stars have been on for 10 years has it? I've never watched a single episode. I really have never. I've been flipping through the channels and I saw some people dancing and everybody cheering and I was like, what in the actual fuck? And I change the channel again.

Speaker 5:          00:40:11       Like you were watching people dance now. Really? Like nobody likes to dance like that. That was like, okay then that will. Isn't that what like Mexican TV was dancing with his door as well as like, you know, you turn on like when we were kids it was like, it was all song and dance, you know, and the Spanish television shows Spanish network. I thought it was all those crazy soap operas. Yeah, that too. But that's what reality TV is, right? We've regressed in some ways while there's a part of us that really we really love base things, you know, we love emotions. Like I was just thinking of this the other day, the talk show host like um, like a Morton Downey jr or Jenny Jones or, or Geraldo Rivera, any of those shows or like Montel Williams where they would have guests and then they would go to the audience and the audience would like say something that would get everybody to go like that, that thing that they created, that parent.

Speaker 5:          00:41:14       Those are like the original Youtube commenters. There's like the original, like social media commentators, the people that are in the audience, they don't have anything to do with what's on it, but they get to interject and say something and then that becomes a part of the entertainment. But it's really just, you know, it's weird social interaction between human beings and us, like sitting as sidelines. What are you showing? Oh yeah, of course. Sure. Springer, he's the master of that. What a crazy way to make a living. Right? I mean, when that guy was a character. Yeah. Is he still is? He's still alive, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. He's actually a very intelligent guy. He wasn't even mayor prize land or something like that. And he got in troubles and prostitution. Cincinnati, there's a little. I think there was a little cocaine problem at one blow, but you know, we, we enjoy those stupid moments that don't mean anything.

Speaker 5:          00:42:10       You know, where someone says something and everybody goes, oh, there's nothing wrong. There's nothing wrong with a guilty pleasure. You know what I mean? Not necessarily. Look, you can't fix the world. You can't be captain. Save a hoe and go out there and fix the whole world. Now go to the Jerry springer crowd and start hanging out Kale leaves and you know, pamphlets for yoga classes snuck in a word. Are you talking about the ego? Talking about everybody, like I eat Kale to dude, it is a thing, man. If you, um, if you've ever mocked like very, uh, just, just really ridiculous proselytizing vegans, which I have people think all of a sudden just like vegans, they think I don't like them or don't eat that food. I eat that food. Almost always I eat more vegetables that I eat meat. I way more vegetables. I eat a lot of it. I think it's good for you. Well, vegans are an easy target that you guys are easiest phone. I mean, so uh, but you're not, you're, you're like, you're like the. If all vegans were like, you, there would be no target because like people who just eat healthy, that's it. You're just someone who enjoys eating plants instead of animal products and that's just, that's just your diet. It doesn't become a fucking religion with you.

Speaker 4:          00:43:24       I mean, look, first of all it's not, it's not my place to, to pass judgment on anybody else in. There are behavior patterns in their habits and you know, I'm not, I'm not trying to, you know, recruit people to my lifestyle, you know, if people want to ask me about it, I'm happy to talk about it. But I'm not like yelling from a bully pulpit, you know, shaming people or the shaming I have. No, I have no, you know, air of moral superiority about it whatsoever. It's a, it's a lifestyle that I choose, but I don't think that, um, that gives me permission to, um, Levy judgment on any other human being and, and their choices. So, you know, the way that I try to communicate the message is to, to, you know, live my life and you know, sort of stand where I'm standing and if people are interested and they'll come to me and, and you know, I can communicate to them. But um, but it's, you know, it's not a proselytizing point of view that I adopt. I think some

Speaker 5:          00:44:32       people adopt certain behaviors just because it gives them license to be an asshole. I really do. I mean there are certain vegans that think that because they are vegans, they can go out and attack and be really shitty to other people and somehow or another they're acting in a positive way and they're going to enact some positive change by being really shitty to people. It's like this idea of a social justice warrior falls into the same category by being really mean to people that you think, think the wrong way or behave the wrong way, that somehow or another you're going to shame them into changing by being really aggressive and offensive to them. I mean, shaming somebody is not an effective way of trying to getting them to change one of the least effective. I mean, look, people change when they're ready to change, you know, it's really an internal willingness that drives change and you know, somebody is either ready to make a change or they're not.

Speaker 5:          00:45:27       And, and different people receive messages in different ways. So if you look at, look, if you look at the Vegan movement, because that's what we're talking about, you know, there are super hardcore animal rights activists and they have a certain way of communicating and there's a certain population of people that are receptive to that kind of communication. There are other people that are interested in environmental issues. They want to be better environmentalists. And so there are people that speak to the Vegan movement from that perspective. Um, and, and there's a certain audience that's receptive to that and the way that I communicated or carry the message is in a different way. And there's, you know, different people that are attracted to that. So I think whatever your, your point of view is or whatever movement you're part of and that we can get into the whole idea of how we're wired to be on teams and how counterproductive that is.

Speaker 5:          00:46:15       But, um, you know, there's enough people out there that are, uh, you know, there's a diversity of voices and a diversity of, of audiences that, you know, every, every, every kind of voice carries a frequency that, that, that other people respond to. I guess I didn't say that very articulately, but I know what you're saying though, you know, there, there are definitely going to be, there's no one that responds well to being insulted though. No one. I mean, if you're really trying to convey a message being really shitty about it is the last thing. Well look at, look at political talk shows on Saturday and Sunday morning and they're just shouting at each other and and basically they're just rallying support from their base. Each side they're trying to win, but they're not, they're not converting people from one side to the other. No one ever gets converted. The only way to have anybody ever gets converted as like, if you can say something very thoughtful that penetrates past this wall of ideology they have in their head and they go and then they have to consider it, but they're not going to consider if you're insulting. They're just not. It's going to be a contest. It's going to be a you versus them. You say something rude to them. They're going to try say something rude or to you and you're, you're playing ping pong, ping pong,

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       ping pong with insults.

Speaker 4:          00:47:31       And to be clear like, you know, I'm a member of this community and you know, I am a proud member, I would say. And you a card carrying member. I have the card in my wallet because it'll leaf is a leaf. It's in that juicy ladies. Glasses don't have cards, we just carry us here. You know, my theory on it, the people that are, that are kind of, you would characterize as vociferous and angry and judgmental. My theory is that there's a certain percentage of the population that come out of the womb. I'm broken. Well, there's that. Okay. So there's that. Of course, you know, there are those people for sure. And there are other people that I think are wired to be super sensitive. Sure. And from a very early age, they just find the idea of, you know, an animal dying for food to be the most intolerable concept they can imagine.

Speaker 4:          00:48:24       Right? And they're just, that's, that's how they came into the world. Right? And so, and so they kind of grow older and they navigate the world and they start, you know, becoming sort of more outspoken about this idea and when people are not receptive to it or they're not seeing the world the way that they're seeing it, they become progressively more frustrated. And that frustration turns to resentment. That resentment can morph into anger and then you know, you have what you see which is, which is people who are, they're just, they're just incensed that other people are not seeing the world the way that they're seeing it. And I think that applies to any contingent of the population that holds a very strong point of view.

Speaker 3:          00:49:06       I, I agree with you. I think that there's, there, there's definitely going to be certain people that are hardwired for sensitivity. There's just no getting around it and you realize that when you have children, you know, I have two young daughters that are so different. They're only two years apart from each other, grew up in the same household. They could not be more different. Right. It's just right out of the box. They're just different people.

Speaker 4:          00:49:27       Yeah. You realize like he had nothing to do with that. Yeah. I mean

Speaker 3:          00:49:32       you have a little bit to do with how they, how they process things and how they deal with things based on learned

Speaker 4:          00:49:38       that innate core kind of perspective and whatever they're naturally inclined to is just, you can see it at such a young age.

Speaker 3:          00:49:47       Yeah, that's the difference, right? The difference is like what, what is a real part of them? What is a real part of them? Like what, what, what is just inescapable. Like they have certain ingredients like a car is made out of aluminum and rubber and metal. There's certain ingredients that certain people have when they're born and also inclinations, inclinations towards certain activities like we were talking about before, like trying to find things that make your children happy and try and encourage things that make your children happy to find a thing that they like that jives with their ingredients. And some people

Speaker 5:          00:50:28       they look at animals and they just have this inescapable in this capable kinship and some of the, someone that kinship is ridiculous. The point where he ever read those tumblr blogs where people think that there should have been born a fox, have fox, can you never seen that? That sounds like something red band which spent a lot of time doing with thinking he used to be just being, you know, being on like weird tumblr sites. Um, we're tumblr sites can get very addictive. You wonder whether or not you're being trolled, you know, some of them are so weird. You wonder like, okay, so this is this real, you know? Yeah. I don't know. Fox can you never heard of that? No, I haven't to look around at people that they, they, they believe that they should have been born as foxes. Yes. Okay. They believe their Fox came spirit open minded thinker.

Speaker 5:          00:51:13       There's other dimensions that play. You saw interstellar I didn't see in yourself that you didn't know. I haven't seen it yet. I'm fucking busy, Bro. Uh, but the, um, the idea is just, that's a ridiculous idea. But I also think that there's also people that have this very idealistic idea of animals and nature itself, which is, hey, there's some videos we've been shown recently with a deer that are eating birds, eating birds alive, which apparently is a recent discovery that deer are not really just herbivores. They're herbivores by convenience, but when they find a birds on the ground, they eat them and they seek them out. They actually chased them. Is that a result of encroaching habitat by urban centers or no? No. These are wild beer in very rural areas there have been observed to. It's uh, apparently they're getting minerals and stuff from, from deer, from a bird's brother, and um, they're more inclined to do so when they're growing their antlers.

Speaker 5:          00:52:11       They feel, you know, more, uh, more drawn to eating birds. That's interesting. I didn't know that. Yeah, there's a bunch of videos. It's kind of disturbing because you, you know, even though I'm a hunter and I eat deer, I think they're beautiful and I always think of him as being these peaceful things and we see them chasing a bird and just chewing it alive and fucking things kicking inside of their mouth and trying to get away. Well, they're just, they're part of the, you know, natural cycle of life. They're just trying to survive like everything else. And I think, you know, I think to the casual observer, you know, or somebody who's listening to this podcast, they may think that there's this giant gap between the way that you live in a way that I live. And I think there's actually a bigger gap between the way that I live in, in the normal human being than yourself because of, you know, look, you're a hunter. I don't hunt, you know, it's not something that I'm interested in doing, but you have a connection to where your food is coming from that is very, um, close and primal. And, and in the grand scheme of things more sustainable than the way that, you know, the average typical American, it's kind of more sustainable. But honestly, not

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       for everybody. The reality,

Speaker 4:          00:53:28       not everybody could do it, you know, not everybody can do it. I mean, I think that, that right now our food system is broken. You know, our, our, our, our system of factory farming. It's unsustainable. I actually brought you this documentary called cowspiracy spirits. Oh, cowspiracy. Yeah. Yeah. I was involved in a producing this movie. You should check it out. But basically it's a look at, at the impact of animal agriculture on our environment. And it's hard. It's pretty interesting.

Speaker 3:          00:54:01       Did you see that, that video that they got a drone video of these gigantic pig farms and the just the fucking unbelievable environmental catastrophe these things create. Would they have lakes of piss and shit from these pigs? It's different. Have you seen it now? Haven't you really should see it and perceiving it? Pull that video up, Jamie, because it's. It's insane to look at. When you stop and think about the, the, the, the amount of Smithfield foods, factory farms. That's it right there. If this guy flies his drone, which is pretty fucking cool that they have these drones now that you could do this and get this high resolution video. Well if you're dealing with a place like Los Angeles, $20, million people, 20 million people and 95 percent of the meat meat, you're dealing with an insane amount of flash that needs to be consumed on a daily basis and it has to be grown somewhere and ship somewhere and conveniently.

Speaker 3:          00:55:00       We want to sort of ignore it like that is a lake of shit and piss and it's all coming from these factories right there in front of you. Those are housing units for pigs, they're stuffed into these things crammed next to each other and they stand on these metal grates. So the metal grates are poorest. They piss and shit. It goes through the holes and it all goes through these tubes that lead down into that giant lake. Apparently the smell, if you're anywhere near there is so bad. You literally feel like you could probably like the air on fire.

Speaker 4:          00:55:36       I'm sure Smithfield, Smithfield is not too excited about this video being out there and you know, there's all these ag gag laws right now that prevent consumers from filming this kind of thing. So that's insane that he's been able to do this with a drone and you know, whether you're, you know, whether you eat bacon for breakfast every morning or you eat more like me. I think we can all agree that, that transparency is important and these companies are not transparent about how they produce their food and there's a lot of problems with it and the waste that it creates and the amount of resources and you know, what goes into this process is something that I think we could all benefit from taking a harder look at. You know, it'd be interesting is if you go to the um, cowspiracy website, they have all these facts about kind of, you know, every sort of environmental of, of

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       what animal agriculture does from water use to see co two emissions to land use to species extinction to rainforest destruction. And when you look at the statistics, it's, it's crazy. It's absolutely crazy. It's like the elephant in the room, you know, we talk about when we talk about global climate change or, or greenhouse gas emissions, we talk about, we talk about fossil fuel use, we talk about fracking and rightly so. These are important things to talk about. But really the thing that we're not talking enough about is the impact of, of our food system on all of these systems. And when you look at, for example, water use, we're talking about water, right? Well, you know there's PSA is in California, we're not supposed to take long showers, we can't water our lawns, all these sorts of things. And the truth is is that consumer water use in California is like five percent and animal agriculture accounts for like 55 percent of all water use.

Speaker 2:          00:57:16       And you know what a bonus. You know what the really big useless one is? Well, golf quality horses. Well animal agriculture, trump's golf courses, at least animal agriculture is like feeding animals at, right? Right. You just feeding fuck right. Dude's rolling balls around on the grass. That's an insane, insane amount of water for your amusement. Yeah. I think it takes something like 660 gallons of water to produce a hamburger and like a thousand gallons of milk or a thousand gallons of water to produce one gallon of milk. Something like that. Like the, the statistics are completely insane and that. Because a lot of it is the water that's used to grow the grain that you're feeding to these animals. So when you look at it systemically, you know, it's just, it doesn't like if you were an alien who beamed down to planet earth and said, take me to your leader and show me how you make your food.

Speaker 2:          00:58:07       He would just be like, you guys are crazy. You're like killing the planet to do this, doesn't it? Doesn't. It doesn't make sense. Not Sustainable in the longterm. If we did it exactly the way we're doing it right now forever. Would that be sustainable? I don't think so. Can we can do it right now? Well, I mean we're. The way that we're doing it right now. I mean we're destroying like rain forest like crazy, right? It's like one to two acres, like every hour or something like that. Isn't that. A lot of it is due to their, they're getting exotic hardwoods and all these different and saw lumbering and there's some of that for sure. And there's palm oil and there's other things like that. But I think the gravity men, like the majority of it goes to grazing land and growing crops for, for livestock. And this is other countries. This is not America, America Amazonian rain forest. We're not cutting down the rainforest in America and we're not getting our beef from there either, but I think, you know, like an insane amount of our total land mass is devoted to, is devoted to animal agriculture too. So, you know, it's like billions of these animals that were specifically raising to eat, you know, and it's, it's a, it's a huge, it's a huge problem. It is a huge problem. That is something that is outside of your normal

Speaker 5:          00:59:22       thinking, normal everyday thinking you're getting on the highway, goddammit. There's traffic today. You're getting to work. Oh Great. We've got this new project we have to deal with and you're, you're, you're real existence. Like all that stuff is bullshit. If you don't have any food, all that traffic, all the work stuff like, hey, you're gonna die. You don't have any food. Like this is like here's, here's a bunch of things that you need to have in place before you think about any other hobbies or projects or whatever you're trying to accomplish with your career. You got to have a place where you can breathe. The air, okay, the air has to be clean. That's one on the ocean, has to be hospitable for fish and plant life for us. Well, if you're a Vegan, you really don't need to worry about anything other than the plant life in the ocean if you're only kelp, but actually calculate a very good source of protein.

Speaker 5:          01:00:10       That goes back to this reductionist idea, right? These are complex ecosystems, so you knock one thing out in the ocean and the domino effect of that, you know like these, the runoff that's caused from waste animal agriculture is a big one. There's all kinds of ways. Just Susan the ocean, and it creates these massive dead zone dead zones. The Algal blooms, right? That deprives them like, like thousands of acres worth across the ocean that are so oxygen deprived that nothing can live in them. Well, there was a big die off when I was in her most a beach a couple of years ago. They had a giant fish die off where it was. Oh, so fucking stinky. It was so nasty. Wash up on the shore. Well, I think they just died like in certain bays, you know, there was an, an area where they just hit a dead zone and a bunch of fish died and supernormal very common happens all the time and it smelled so bad.

Speaker 5:          01:01:05       It was just, you know, probably a fucking million dead fish or something. I'll. Yeah, awful. But when we're. So what we're getting at, but. But I mean, yeah, I mean as you know, as typical consumers were, were divorced from that. That's not in our face. You know what I mean? Like we're not really, we don't have to reckon with that on a daily basis, is it possible that like, could you have an entire city of 20 million people? You couldn't have an entire city of 20 million people that lived as hunters. You really couldn't. You would need more animals. But could you have an entire city of 20 million people that were Vegan? Oh yeah. I mean, I, I think that, that the amount of land that you need to grow food for vegans is like, you know, I don't know, a fraction, a tiny fraction of the amount of land that is required to raise animals for food because the animals have to eat a lot of food in order to get to a size. I mean, you need, you need tons of grazing land and, and you know, like if you go to go to cowspiracy.com and there's a section called facts and they kind of break it all down. It's kind of interesting to look at. Um, but, but yeah, I mean I think that, that the amount of land, like we're producing enough food to feed the planet really. It's really like an allocation and distribution issue as much as any meeting we use like American, but most of the food that we're growing

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       in the bread basket of America is going to livestock. It's not going to human beings. I mean like the corn fields, they're also making that core and that's really not even edible for humans. That, uh, you see you saw king corn? Uh, yeah, I did. It's amazing, amazing documentary. We're all like made out of fucking crazy when they, when they do the tests on their body and they find out that the carbon for core and then human, the carbon in their body is coming from corn. If you find out how much, how many different things at the supermarket when they went through the supermarket, they looked at all the different things that have corn syrup and corn starch, corn, corn, this corn that. It's like, wow, how did that happen? How did they hijack the entire food system? I mean, you don't write amazing. He'd fucking corn, you know, like all that stuff that they're using corn for is not really necessary, but you can profit off of it if you own the corn and if you have some sort of a relationship with the government, you can get a subsidy subsidy's and that's what happens.

Speaker 2:          01:03:23       They're, they're being fed off subsidies. That's one of the things that was most disturbing about it. Like, wait a minute, this is so destructive and this is. And you guys couldn't even afford to grow this shit if it wasn't for the government. If the government didn't pay corn farmers, they didn't have government subsidies, a lot of them would just go under. Yeah, I mean I think that we're, we're entrenched in this system that is dependent upon these subsidies. Right? And so much of our economy functions in this way. And I think if we really want to change our food system, we have to eradicate these subsidies. And when you look at, you know, look, there's a reason why. I think we talked about this last time. I can't remember. There's a reason why like Taco Bell Taco is like whatever it is, dollar and nine cents or whatever. And it's like it's the same price.

Speaker 2:          01:04:07       It was when we were 12. Like how does that work? You know, a Mcdonald's cheeseburger is like two bucks or whatever it is. But if you factor in, like if you look at it from a Meta perspective and you take into account all the subsidies, you know, a big Mac would actually cost something like 7:50 or you know, it'd be like a multiple on its price. There's a book called metagenomics by this guy called David Simon where he, I'm sorry, meet and Omics, and he really breaks down how these subsidies work and how that kind of fuels this food system that really is creating it. It's sort of, it's, it's making the, the, um, the lower socioeconomic class, like less and less healthy because it's creating this wider gap between healthy living and unhealthy living because in food deserts, in urban food deserts where there is no farmer's market, but there's Mcdonald's and Jack in the box on every corner and you know, you're on welfare and you got three kids, like, what are you going to do? Right? You're going to eat shitty food is too cheap to not. That's a really good point. That's a really good point as far as the amount that it costs

Speaker 5:          01:05:18       for these things and that the fact that it's because of subsidies as a result of that we're in this place right now where suddenly health and wellness have become elitist ideals, you know, synonymous with, you know, spending a ton of money at whole foods and that's crazy. Are you opposed to eating like chicken eggs, like from someone who grows chickens and has them like free ranging and you know, like I have chickens that they, they lay eggs every day and they're, they're essentially my pets. I eat, I eat my pet's food, you know, I feed them, they eat a lot of the table scraps but they, they, a lot of them, they just free range. They run around eating stuff in the grass and bugs and from like an ethical point of view, you know, if you're raising your own chickens and they're like your pets and they're laying eggs that are not going to be, you know, turn into chickens than I think ethically I don't really see a problem with that.

Speaker 5:          01:06:19       You know what I mean? Like like they're not going to, you know, they're not going to knock those eggs, are not going to turn into chickens, but Peter has this thing on their website about eggs being chicken periods and they're trying to discourage people from eating eggs. Have you ever seen it? It's hilarious. It's one of those things where it just shows you like the. There's, there's ethical considerations when it comes to livestock and animals that are there. They've rational, they make sense. And then you get into this extreme animal rights ideology where they try to twist reality and so they have like a bloody bloody pair of underwear and a chicken. Like here it is. Look at this. Eggs come from chicken menstruation. So they're frying a bloody pair of underwear in a frying pan. Don't eat eggs period. And the word period is red, like period blood.

Speaker 5:          01:07:14       I mean this is the stage of my Peta. They're very effective at marketing. They were talking while we're talking about it right now, we're talking about how retarded they are. I eat seven more eggs today just because of these assets. That's not, that's not like effective. If you're. If, if you have chickens at your home and they're your pets and your kids play with them and they're laying eggs that are not going to turn into chickens and you decide that you want to eat those eggs from a, from a morality point of view, like how can I. I don't, I don't really see how I could have a big problem with that. Now if you decide that you want to cut the head off that chicken and fry it up, then then when it comes up because well it's becomes a different thing. Right? Becomes different than becomes a different thing. What was the last time he ate meat? So it's been awhile. I went to, you went vegan and it's been, has been eight years coming up on nine maybe. Wow. Do you ever smell like your neighbor cooking a steak and go, yeah, I mean, you know, I'm not one of those people who's like, oh, it repulses me and I

Speaker 4:          01:08:16       want to throw up, you know, like I got into it for health reasons. Right. And you know, I listened. I've eaten more meat in my lifetime than any human being ever should, you know, it's like I'm not, you know, I like it, you know, I drive by Mcdonald's or Jack in the box and I smell that and that we might discuss some people, but it triggers like this addictive response in me where it's like, I will crave that, you know, because there's so much time has passed between me and eating those foods. I don't have that, that sort of obsessive compulsive thing that kicks in. Like I'm also, I'm a recovering alcoholic, like I have. Um, I'm like, you know, I can get addicted to things pretty fucking easy. Right? So that's part of my thing, like for me to draw a lot, uh, you know, kind of a line in the sand and say like, no more is kind of the way that I have to do it right, because otherwise it inhabits my consciousness too much.

Speaker 4:          01:09:06       But you have to put up boundaries where the unsurmountable boundaries, there are certain diets that say, Oh, you can have a cheat day. Right? So it's like if you told me that I could have in and out burger like once a week, like I would, I would spend six days thinking about the day that I could have in and out burger. You know what I mean? Like in order to free myself from that prison, I need time away. Right. So, you know, it's, it's really powerful with me, whether it's a cheeseburger or a drink or a drug, you know, and that's just me, you know, it's just my experience. But when I smelled that, yeah, triggers that thing, I'm like, oh, that's good, but if it passes quickly, but if I was eating those things, I might find myself driving into the drive through.

Speaker 5:          01:09:50       You know, that's an issue with people that have eating disorders where the. It's almost like the, the, the desire to have that forbidden food overwhelms their desire to be healthy. It's like that, that it just becomes this thing like I've got, I've got an itch it, I've got an Itch, itchy, I got to scratch it. I can't help it. Yeah. Transcends logic and it becomes psychological. It becomes a psychological issue way more than it is a physiological issue.

Speaker 4:          01:10:21       It's almost beyond psychology though, like it's so embedded now for anybody who's truly like an addict or an alcoholic like it. It goes to the core, you know, there is no overriding it. When that kicks in, it's just, it's happening.

Speaker 5:          01:10:40       I had a friend who was on the Atkins Diet and my friend Eddie Bravo, he was on the Atkins Diet and he would do it for six days a week and then midnight on Saturday night that mother fucker would go off the rails like a runaway train piloted by a meth addict. Oh my God. You. What do you intuit for? What do you intuit from that? Right. Like he's building a lot of ways. He loaded up all week. So it worked though. But why would you. I'm not saying that an atkins diet is a healthy diet because I don't think it is, but, but what's wrong an atkins diet, if you

Speaker 4:          01:11:13       could say so from an. Well, I mean I'm not a nutritional scientists dots or you know, I would say that that, that I'm a diet that's super focused on basically excluding anything with any carbohydrates in it and eating foods that are devoid of any fiber, which I think is really important. We talk about protein a lot, but I think most people, I think that conversation should really be about fiber, like nobody's protein deficient. I think three percent of the population has protein deficient. Most Americans are fiber deficient though we just don't eat enough vegetables. But as the atkins diet fiber deficient manner did they tell you can eat broccoli. I think that they. I think that there a, there is a focus on, on meat and dairy products, right? It's like, I mean I'm not an expert on the, on the atkins diet sort of. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:12:00       It's like being in Ketosis and you know, that's a very, you know, hot button thing and you know, there are people that are all about like being in Ketosis and my understanding of that is that it's kind of a crisis state for the human body. It's not a natural state of being, it's sort of like what your body has to do when it's being deprived of other nutrients to be in this state. Like you put these acid ketones in your body, which then are converted to some form of Glucose because you're so glucose deprived, right? Our brains run on Glucose or bodies need glucose. You know, if you look at, look at, you know, the longest living pockets, the pockets of civilization across the world where people live the longest and are the healthiest in are the happiest. Like the blue zones you've heard of the blue zones, right?

Speaker 4:          01:12:45       So Dan Buettner, who's the guy who traveled to all of these places, it was a friend of mine's amazing guy. You should have them on the podcast. He's amazing. What's his name? Dan Buettner be you be you e t, t e n e r, he's a national geographic fellow. He's so impressive. He's what's his, uh, his uh, well he's, he's the guy who wrote the blue zones books. So he, he was, uh, like a global adventurer who set like three world records, like cycling across the planet doing all these crazy things and, and cycling. Well, he rode his bike across Africa, like north to south, I think, what the fuck you wrote across Russia like when this was, when he was younger and then, uh, you know, he became interested in indigenous populations. He started working with National Geographic. He became a writer and a, and in his travels he became obsessed with finding places where people are the happiest, live, the longest free of disease, et Cetera. And that ultimately became what are today known as the blue zones. Like these, like these little sort of hidden pockets on the planet that are kind of untouched from the gestalt of our modern society and you know, they're little tiny places kind of off the beaten path. I, you know, Eco, the, uh, which is like an island off the coast of Turkey, Sardinia, Okinawa, and ironically Loma Linda here, like not too far from here. And so the Loma Linda, which is pretty interesting. Yeah. And that's at work. It's

Speaker 2:          01:14:12       a cultural thing because it's a community of seventh day adventists and it's a very strong faith based community that also basically subsist on a plant based diet and they live in. They live incredibly long. There you go. So the seven day adventist adventist, seventh day adventist, it's weird word. They are live. Say it. Even if you're saying it correctly, it seems like you're doing it wrong and it's a very strong faith based community and they a based diet, physical activity, social engagement, social engagement support and huge. It's huge. And, and, and so, so from, from studying these cultures, he extracted certain kind of guiding principles about how they live their life and one of them to get back to the question about kind of Atkins Diet is, you know, they all eat a very starchy, um, you know, fiber rich essentially plant based diet doesn't mean they're all vegans like the, a little bit of meat.

Speaker 2:          01:15:09       But essentially their diet is founded upon starchy vegetables for the most part. And, and community and accountability and kind of keeping your elders around and all these sorts of things have really, you know, distinguishes them as a, you know, from the way that we live our lives now, right? Like, you know, we're just, we're, we're isolated, we're fast paced and all these sorts of, you know, kind of principles upon which we navigate our day or just very divorced from the way that these people are living. I love that it says empowered women. Empowered women is a factor in age. That's, that's fascinating. I wonder what that's about. A big part of it too. I had Dan on my podcast, so if people are listening, they can, they can check him out. He was great. But he, uh, a big part of it too is, um, is having purpose, like sort of identifying early on in your life, uh, you know, what your purpose is and, and serving that purpose.

Speaker 2:          01:16:08       And these people don't retire, you know, they're just, they're sort of, you know, living and continuing to be productive like way later in life than we're used to seeing enjoying your time here and that positive energy. That's attached to enjoying your time here, sustains your existence in a much better way. Yeah. Sort of. Sort of low grade exercise. These people, you know, they're always moving, you know, they're not out running. They're not on the treadmill, but they're in their garden and they're walking to their friend's house and you know, they're very engaged with their community. They're constantly very intimate way. Yeah. Do you know I had a Aubrey de Grey on the other day who's a life extension scientist as a, at the forefront of the various technologies are being developed to extend life. He said the difference between the average and these cultures where they live far longer is four years. That's the big goal that everybody's trying to attain. Like live like these people that

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       live the longest and that's four years. Four. There's a four year difference,

Speaker 4:          01:17:14       right? Well I think, you know, in these blue zones they have the highest percentage per capita of centenarians. People living longer than 100, but I think it's less about that age than it is about the quality of, of your years. Right. Like, you know, listen, go to the airport and look at how many people are in wheelchairs and you know, on walkers and stuff like that. People that are not old go to Disneyland. Yeah, it's crazy.

Speaker 3:          01:17:34       Do you ever go to Disneyland people on Scooters overflowing out of the side of the scooters with their legs and their gut and just who?

Speaker 4:          01:17:43       Oh right. So right now in America, you know, we can split hairs over, you know, should you take fish oil or not, or is it okay for you to eat the eggs from your chicken and your backyard? But the truth is this is not the problem that we need to be talking about. We need to be talking about the fact that one out of every three Americans is going to die of a heart attack and 70 percent of Americans are obese or overweight and they're predicting that by 20, 30, 50 percent of Americans are going to be diabetic or prediabetic. Just think about that is that real

Speaker 3:          01:18:16       20, 30, 50 percent of Americans are going to be diabetic or prediabetic diabetes. Fucking insane. One out of it.

Speaker 4:          01:18:24       Every three people is going to die of heart disease. Heart disease is a lifestyle and foodborne illness. It doesn't have to exist and we're in this place right now where it's sort of like some congenital verge there. There, there is for sure, but that's not worth. But if you look back through the history of mankind, there are plenty of populations that existed for hundreds and thousands of years without any significant incidence of heart disease, you know, especially in rural areas of China for long, long years until we started exporting our diet and lifestyle overseas and now, you know, it's sort of like the latest installment of the avengers, you know, we're sending these fast food restaurants to these places and they're having, they're having and as the sort of ascension of the middle class in China, you know, continues and they can afford to purchase more meat products. They're having a heart problem. They are having disease problems that they've, they haven't seen. You know, it's an unprecedented in the history of their culture.

Speaker 3:          01:19:29       So it seems also there's a real issue with human beings when it comes to patterns of behavior and habits that are very, very difficult to break. And uh, like as you were saying before, like if you could have a day where you could cheat that day, that would become the habit and then it would do. You would be thinking about that one day. Like it's very hard for people who are extremely obese who just their main form of pleasure is pleasure. Of course they get that wired it in their face and then that's what that whole fucking corndogs so good. And that's where they're getting their pleasure from. It's hard to deviate from that. It's hard to change your patterns. Yeah. You,

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       you are managing your emotional wellbeing through the food choices that you're making, that you make and they're putting on. There's a great book called Salt Sugar Fat by this guy called Michael Morris and he kind of looks at these big food companies and draws an analogy to the tobacco companies in the seventies in the way that these companies are funneling money and research and marketing dollars into devising food products that are specifically designed to activate that pleasure center in your brain. Right? So that they know, they're like, they're trying to make that food impossible for you to just have one. And once you kind of tap into that, that um, you know, ability to trigger that response in somebody and you create a habit out of that and addictive response. Then you have a customer for life, right? You know, it's like, why is it so hard to eat one fucking chip? You know, there's a reason behind that. There's something about the, the, the proportion of, of salt and grease, you know, that will just trigger something in somebody.

Speaker 5:          01:21:18       Do know the feeling that you have when you do indulge in some really shitty food that you have just like, ugh. After it's over, you feel like such a loser. If I like a bag of chips, go into a shame spiral. I feel angry at myself. Fucking dummy ate a bag of chips. I never went back. But when you're doing it, you're like, I can't even help myself. It's hard. Like a greedy, greedy monster. Like um, you know what I read? I have a, I have a real weakness for those. Uh, salt, sea salt and vinegar potato chips. Oh good. God. Good. The real thick one. The kettle chip. That's what I'm talking about. Oh, they're so good. And you look at the bag and it says non GMO in the front. You're like, oh, excellent. I don't want to GMO potato. I mean other even gmo potatoes.

Speaker 5:          01:22:12       I don't know. I don't say those last a long time. I think so we'll need to write. Yeah. Storm hadn't been heading in that direction though. Do potato chips? That's my guilty pleasure. It's tough. The kettle chips are tough. Fucking real hard Vegan, you know, I try not to be bad. I had a friend is Vegan. He's fat as fuck. Well, it's never been easier. It's never been easier to be an unhealthy Vegan. I mean just walk the aisles at whole foods or Erewhon like, you know, there's so many Vegan ice creams now and sort of meat alternatives and pasta sauces that are tasty. Yeah. And say getty is totally Vegan and you get it from the right place.

Speaker 4:          01:22:54       Oh, oh yeah. Without a doubt. Yeah. Yeah. So there's plenty of options now. And so just because you're Vegan, that doesn't mean that you're, you're eating a healthy diet for sure. You know, that's important. I for

Speaker 3:          01:23:05       people understand. And there's a lot of people also that think that drinking juice, drinking fruit juice is really good for you. Be careful about that folks, because you're not supposed to drink like a court of orange juice. That's not how that juice is supposed to get to your body the way that juice is supposed to get to your bodies by eating a fucking orange. Exactly. Yeah. When you drink like a pie quarter of pineapple juice, like what? A fucking shock of sugar to your system just because it's attached to fruit, which we, uh, assume rightly so is healthy. Just have some goddamn fruit, drink some water while you having a big plate of pineapple and you'll be way better off than drinking pineapple juice.

Speaker 4:          01:23:45       Yeah. I couldn't agree with you more. You know, we're talking about fiber. It's like, why would you remove all the fiber? Yes. On that plant. Exactly. I think juicing has its place though, but there's a, there's a huge difference between that gallon of Tropicana at the grocery store and cold pressing, you know, some Kale and spinach with some tumeric in it

Speaker 3:          01:24:04       that's different. You know what I mean? Like I think that the sugar. Yeah, sugar is the real issue

Speaker 4:          01:24:08       you can get. It's, I look at it as medicinal and you know, it's like if you want a really concentrated dose of, of uh, you know, micro nutrients and you know, the kinds of, um, highly compacted vitamins and minerals that you can get in some of these foods, these plants than it has its place. But, but to, you know, run 20 oranges through a juicer and drink that you're, you're getting a huge amount of sugar in that and you're depriving yourself of the digestive process. And the fiber that comes with just eating the whole food, like nature figured it out, man. Like why are you trying to, you know, just like the more you focus on eating these kinds of foods close to their natural state, your Palette changes and you start to desire them. Like I know these guys that are, uh, that are fruitarian like they, all they eat is fruit like this.

Speaker 4:          01:25:00       Their whole lifestyle, right? It's called the 80 10, 10, 80 10, 10 diet, 80 percent carbs, 10 percent protein, 10 percent fat. But essentially what it means is they eat fruit all day long. That's it totally raw. They'll eat like 30 bananas a day. I've heard. Right? And so, so, you know, somebody who is from that, Atkins, Ketosis, low carb camp will tell you that that's an extremely unhealthy thing to do. Now, I'm not a fruitarian I don't have any direct experience with that. I don't know what the longterm ramifications of, of living that lifestyle are. But I do know people that live this way and they're super healthy people and some of them are amazing athletes. Like my friend Michael Arnstein, he's fruitarian, he has been forever, uh, and he was like the fifth fastest guide than New York City Marathon not too many years ago. Like, like an elite athlete who's eating this way, that's literally he'll, he has to eat so much fruit that he has like two giant extra refrigerators in his house and he would have to drive

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       this big truck to like a fruit wholesale or once a week. And like the guy at the wholesaler thought that he had like a bodega or something like that because he couldn't believe how much fruit this guy was buying. You know, one of the UFC fighters you'd like that are there. I believe Nate Diaz, he's like that. I think he's on the 30 bananas a day. Yeah. Yeah. Um, well, uh, but that didn't work. He got his ass kicked. I mean, Mac, Mac Dansik was playing around with it for awhile. I don't know if he's still on it, but people that I've talked to who have like dabbled in it say that when they're doing it they feel amazing and his people are trim and they don't have. They're not getting diabetes and they're, they're getting a tremendous amount of glucose. They're also getting a huge amount of fiber and they're still meeting their protein needs.

Speaker 2:          01:26:45       It's interesting. So when I look at that, it just makes me, it gives me a different perspective on this obsession that we have with protein. Like everyone's walking around worried about, you know, meeting their protein needs. And the truth is, is that, you know, the average semi sedentary person is eating two to five times the recommended daily allowance of protein. Like it's just, it's a nonissue. It's really kind of a red herring. I should clarify that. Nate Diaz was probably injured. I think there was something wrong with him in his last fight. So I have nothing to do with his diet. I'm just fucking around. And uh, he also fought Hoffeld dose on Joe's, which is one of the best fighters in the world is the current champion. So his diet, I'm sure it had nothing to do with him losing, but um, is there a higher dietary requirements of protein for people that like say competing power lifting or things along those lines?

Speaker 2:          01:27:32       And are there any power lifters that are Vegan? There is a guy called Patrick Baboon Mian. He's German dude, German strong man. This dude is the human wolverine. He's insane. And I had that privilege. I made a youtube video of it. Maybe you guys can pull it up. Um, I was on stage with him at, uh, an event in Toronto a couple of years ago where he attempted to break a Guinness Book of world record by being, by carrying more weight than any other human being ever had. You put 1200 pounds on a chassis that he carried. He had to carry it 10 meters and he accomplished. It was extraordinary. And the guys totally Vegan. Wow. Pulled that up. Did Not Guide the mountain from game of thrones. Just break that though. I think he did like 1600 pounds. Yeah. He, um, he's like one of the strongest man in the world.

Speaker 2:          01:28:21       The guy who was the dude, he's going to be aquaman. That guy. No, no, no. He's. He's the mountain and the game of thrones in. He's from Iceland. I'm a little bit behind or miss enormous man. There was a guy go full screen on the Kenya or it will fuck us up our videos. I'll fucking weird here because we do it all for tri caster. I to tell you I met one of the guys that works at Tri caster. We're hooked up. Look at this. Twelve hundred pounds. Yeah. Why does it not look at that dark that doesn't have 1200 DPI? Definitely is. There were all these people that are verifying it and they had all this shit that doesn't seem like it's 1200 pounds. Why is that a. Why does that look so light? I assure you that it was. How dare you a day. That's like 50 pounds.

Speaker 2:          01:29:06       Is it? Do you guys get graded on a scale? Because he's Vegan, like it's not really 1240 minutes talking about sounds like dog years Vegan. Twelve hundred pounds, which is 120 pounds. Well, he's enormous. That guy's fucking giant, so whatever it is, that guy got all that muscle from being a Vegan. Right? Like a bull. Ballsy. Granted he, he hasn't been a Vegan his entire life, you know, so it's not like he was reared that way, but I think he's been, he's been that way long enough and he will tell you that his strength training improved and his agility and his ability to recover a was significantly enhanced when you changed it to the mountain thousand year old weightlifting record. He put this huge log on his back. That guy's enormous. Terrifying. Yes. At different, a different animal, especially Iceland. There's something about Iceland diversity advice piece on Iceland, the strong men of Iceland.

Speaker 2:          01:29:58       The vice did a whole video on it, like apparently the people in Iceland did. They have a long history of being like strong men competitors for whatever reason. It was fucking giant dudes out there form vikings or something. Yeah, it's interesting. I mean, I think to your point, and your question was, do you think that somebody who's of that ilk or you know, like a power lifter or a strength athlete, if their. If their protein requirements are are higher, I don't know. I know that Patrick supplements with plant based protein powders from time to time. I don't know that you know, he, he probably is taking in somewhere between 80 to 100 grams a day. It's not. Yeah, like pre P, brown rice, hemp protein, hemp protein. I think it's great. I'm complete amino acid profile. I mean essentially look, it's complicated, right? It's not, we can't be reductionist about it, but in the most general sense when we're talking about protein, we're talking about amino acids, right? We're talking about the building blocks of protein and we're specifically talking about the nine slash amino acids, the essential amino acids that we can't synthesize on around that we have to get from the foods that we eat. Right? So, so it's a question of making sure that we are ingesting those nine essential amino acids. Right? So does it matter where they come from? In what form? You know, they, they are delivered to your body. Does it matter if it's in hemp or if it's in steak?

Speaker 2:          01:31:28       We don't. No, we don't. Yeah, we don't know. All I can tell you is that, you know, I seem to be doing okay with it, so, and I can just share my experience with it. That's all. Yeah. There's um, there was an issue, or Travis Barker was in that plane crash. Do you know that story? Barker, the drummer? Yeah, I, I've seen the juicy ladies all the time. He's in the neighborhood. He, uh, he was in a plane crash and had to get skin grafts and got off of his Vegan Diet because of that, like he having a hard time healing and the starting to me and he healed much quicker. Yeah. I don't know. I hadn't heard that. Um, but that's pretty sure. He's pretty sure he's, you know, he's, he's, he's pretty hardcore Vegan. He's partner in that restaurant crossroads. Have you been a crossroads?

Speaker 2:          01:32:14       Where does that phenomenal restaurant restaurants and it's in Hollywood. Yeah, but it's Tal Ronen who's the chef. There is a mastermind. He's a genius in the food is extraordinary. You should check it out. Okay. I'm, I'm, I'm just stating what I heard, what I read. I don't know about him after the accident. I hadn't heard that. Is there any properties that would exist in, in flesh and blood and eating meat that would somehow or another benefit you recovering from an injury? Does that make sense? Yeah. I don't, uh, you know, that, that would expedite that process. I mean there are, there's a difference between the way I feel when I eat like wild game versus the way I feel when I eat steak that's like raised factory rails, steak or whatever. There's a difference in the way your body reacts to it. Your body has a, there's a, there's a feeling that you eat.

Speaker 2:          01:33:06       Especially Moose. Moose is very unusual for whatever reason. When you eat moose you get this, like you almost feel like it's a stimulant. It's very strange. Like when you eat rare, cause heat, it rare. It's a very lean and there was this weird like woo, like you get a charge after it. Very similar to what I get when I eat kale shakes when I, when I Kale shake some of the things that I tell people. If you want to change your diet, like here's one of the best ways to eat something healthy, get a positive reaction from that, you want to repeat it, and one of the best positive reactions I've ever gotten is I drink these Kale shakes in the morning. I called them hoke loads, so I talk about all the time it's Kale, cucumber, celery, a large chunk of ginger, a four cloves of garlic, coconut oil, and an apple blend that sucker up together and there is a nutrient blast that you get in there that it's a tangible, a stimulant, sort of a feeling like I get, I feel stimulant.

Speaker 2:          01:34:08       Yeah, that'll get it done. Right? And, and that's what I say to people all the time. They're like, I'm like, look man, don't worry about whether you're gonna do this all the way or what you're going to do tomorrow. Just like wake up and drink that salad for breakfast and make that connection with how you feel because truly nothing will make you feel better in the morning than drinking a super nutrient dense green shake. It's just, you know, I mean, whether it has, you know, you can have variations on a theme, like I do something similar, it's a little bit different and it's never the same, you know, I changed it from day to day or whatever, but once you make that connection and you're like, Oh wow, you know, then that starts to change the microbial ecology in your gut. Yeah, that's interesting, isn't it?

Speaker 2:          01:34:53       And the, and the, and I think we talked about this last time too, like all these studies that are coming out about how important your microbiome is to all kinds of things that impact your health and, and how and how there's some evidence to suggest that the quality of your gut biome, uh, can impact your cravings. Right? Oh, for sure. So sugar, when you have, that's a real issue with sugar. So when people say, well, I just crave this, you know, my body's telling me that I need it. Well that's not an objective analysis, right? Just because you crave something that doesn't mean that your body needs it in my own interview. Maybe it does, but if I. yeah, exactly right. So how do you discern between the two? Yeah, that's an interesting point. Um, would, that's absolutely a fact when it comes to a gut microbes when it comes to sugar, that if you feed those microbes a lot of sugar, they become dependent upon it and they need it to survive.

Speaker 2:          01:35:48       And so they're impulsing you, I need more of that. Then you're in this cycle. So they analyze the gut biome of people that are like Chocoholics, right? And it was very different from people that are ambivalent about chocolate. That's such a bizarre thing that you could have these organisms living inside your intestinal track that are actually changing the way you crave things. So they're sending some sort of stimulus that gets to your brain and it's altering the way you, you, you, you want food in your body. Well, it's an assault to your idea that you are essentially human being who is in control of your thoughts. And then that leads to the question of higher consciousness versus you know, the sort of looping, you know, kind of a thing that your brain can do, right? Like what does that mean? You know, when you observe your own thoughts, what is it that your who's The observer, but you know what I mean, like, so you know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          01:36:48       Like if you're having a dream and you're having a conversation with somebody in a dream and you're surprised at what somebody tells you, but you're imagining that, right? Right. So because you didn't know in your dream that that person was going to say that thing to you, but on some level obviously you did. Well, that's the complex nuances of Caruso for sure. And, and the complex nuances of just consciousness, you know? Yeah. The idea that there could be microbes in your body that are stimulating and changing the way your brain functions is so that, that seems so alien to people because we like to think of ourselves as autonomous. Right. But we're not, we, we're, we're far more microbes than human whamming the percentage. I don't know. I can't remember what the percentage is, but it's ridiculous. Like, like the, the number of, of microorganisms like trumps the number of cells you have in your body by like a factor of, you know, some, I don't know if it's 10 or something crazy where there's more eco lie living in your gut than there have ever been people ever. That's, that's real. Those are real numbers. There's also, it's not, it's not. You know, you have to have a healthy symbiotic relationship with

Speaker 3:          01:37:56       this, right? Like you need it to live. It's part of being healthy. Yeah. We've talked about this, I believe last time, various forms of probiotics that you engage in. Sauerkraut, I think you said one of them. Kimchi, Kimchi. I love Kimchi. Kimchi is great. Love that stuff. Come up. My wife fucking hates it. Says it makes me smell tough. Shit. Yeah. Kombucha. I love that stuff too. But you know, it pisses me off man. They fucking. That a gts Kombucha had to pull the, the really good stuff and put that water down horseshit because it's more than one half of one percent alcohol. The fermentation process. Microbes tiny trace of fermentation that like left a little bit of alcohol in it that caused this whole thing and they had to pull it. They had to pull everything. We started a state. We started making our own.

Speaker 3:          01:38:40       Have you ever made your own gas? I did it just so you have the big scoby. I've been in a Kombucha drinker since 94. When I started drinking it, I'm Andy Dick turned me onto it and Andy Dick gave me a fucking, a slab of Kombucha, a fungus to take home. And I got a bowl and I started brewing it in my refrigerator and a man. Oh Oj that was long before. And you know, gts or anybody. Oh, you couldn't buy it. I used to, uh, I used to have a bowl, like a huge salad bowl in my frigerator with a fucking living fungus in it. And I would have the Saran wrap on it. There was sugar and stuff in the bowl. I forget what was the ingredients were and it would feed off of that and I would leave it in there for a certain amount of time and then pour it into a glass and drink it.

Speaker 3:          01:39:24       It's great, but it was too much of a pain in the ass. And then I'm somewhere in the late nineties. I started finding it in stores and then I got into it. But now I have a bunch here. It's everywhere. I don't, I don't go. I mean, I drink it every day and when I go on the road, um, most of the times I'll find a whole foods and uh, I'll stock up on it and leave it in my hotel room. I think it's probiotics or. So I, I'm very rarely sick. I mean very rarely and I travel a lot and one of the things that I attribute that to is probiotics. I think that you really, it's one of the unsung heroes of the immune system that people don't take into consideration the symbiotic relationship that we have with all these weird microorganisms that you ingest.

Speaker 3:          01:40:12       And the more of those you have, the less deficits you have a in terms of your nutritional intake and the more I'm more positive microbes and positive bio organisms that you take into your body, the more you're going to have the whole system is going to function better and be able to fight off immune or fight off disease better. Yeah, for sure. The example that I always give, I think I might've shared this last time, I'm not sure if we did. It was the last time was a long time ago. Probably nobody saw that anyway, but, um, the example that I always give is, uh, is from supersize me, the Morgan spurlock documentary where he decides he's going to eat Mcdonald's for 30 days straight. And for people that saw the movie, um, you might remember that, you know,

Speaker 4:          01:40:54       a couple of days in, into this experiment, you know, he just, he can't imagine how he's going to make it through 30 days. And there's that scene where he's in the car and he actually vomited out the window after he drinks a milkshake or something like that. And you just like, this is the worst. And then, and then fast forward like two weeks later and there's a scene where he's like waking up in the morning and he's like, oh, I feel so sick. He's like, I feel terrible. He's like, let's go to Mcdonald's, you know, for his breakfast. And then he eats, he eats his whatever he ate for breakfast at Mcdonald's that morning. And like, he walks out and he's like, I feel awesome. You know, like he had to get, like he had to get his fix. And so, you know, what I see in that is somebody whose microbiome has adjusted, he has replaced because at the time his girlfriend, uh, was a Vegan chef, right? So he was coming off of eating essentially a plant based diet. It goes into this Mcdonald's thing. And by virtue of bombarding his system with Mcdonald's food, uh, he reap, he repopulates his gut biome with the kind of micro organisms that feed off Mcdonald's food, right? So suddenly, you know, because those microorganisms are on the food that you're eating, right? And then they feed into your gut and then they start to propagate and suddenly he's craving these foods that were making him sick two weeks earlier that he couldn't imagine continuing to eat.

Speaker 3:          01:42:21       That's the weirdest thing about died is you're essentially creating a civilization in your body and the trip. It really is. It really. I mean you're, you are, you're, you're a super organism. You are a container

Speaker 4:          01:42:35       and human beings are the microbiome of the planet,

Speaker 3:          01:42:38       right? Yeah. Yeah. I mean that's a good sign that our earth is sick when you check out.

Speaker 4:          01:42:46       Sure. An unhealthy gut bacteria for the planet

Speaker 3:          01:42:49       in a lot of ways. I mean really is. It's almost like, it's almost like everything behaves in this sort of fractal manner where you know, the bigger you get like a main and the earth itself is probably, you know, a microbe in the greater sense of the galaxy, which is a micro and a greater sense of the universe. And it's all sort of connected in some weird way. And that the lower you get down to gut microbes and how you fuel those gut microbes and how it impacts the health of the actual super organism itself. The human being as a really fascinating. It really is. It really is. When you stop and think about it, because very few people think of themselves as being a host for life. Like I am just this. I'm just trying to keep my garden healthy. You know the garden of my body, which is filled.

Speaker 3:          01:43:38       No, you think of it. I am rich roll. I am this one. I am the one. I am one. I am one thing, but you're not. No one is one thing, but the brain thinks it's one thing which is a fucker man. What a weird. That your brain doesn't realize, hey, you know, I'm, I'm getting all these signals to eat Mcdonald's because I've got all these weird asshole Mcdonald's bacteria living in my gut and what I need to do, I need to get some cucumber bacteria down in there to fuck with the McDonald's bacteria. It's a very. It's a very fascinating thing to be a human being and to be completely disconnected from that reality without externally taking it in, in the form of education and knowledge and then having to internalize it, having to think about and go, okay, I need to take into consideration that I am not just a one, I am a container for all these different organisms and the the amount of positive organisms will directly affect the way the brain works. Fuck, that's hard to think, man. That's hard to. Hard to wrap your head around.

Speaker 2:          01:44:48       Then factor in the emotional override that takes over, that compels you to take an action irrespective of the logical choice after you've been educated. I think that's equally as powerful, if not more powerful.

Speaker 3:          01:45:02       Yeah, all. Oftentimes that can be adjust. All that can be adjusted with momentum. If you can just just fucking force yourself into a pattern that's more positive. Just somehow or another say, okay. You know, like some people say, I'm going to start training for a marathon. I'm going to start on Monday and Monday I'm gonna run two miles and then you know, we're gonna be on the system of recovery and this is what I'm going to do and you're going to go into training. I'm going to start a training camp. It's all written down and if you can do that, if you could do that with your diet, I can't tell you how many people have come up to me and said I have lost a tremendous amount of weight since listen to your podcasts because I started incorporating Kale shakes into my diet. That's my primary breakfast is a Kale shake and it changed everything. I mean I'm talking about hundreds. It's almost like a joke. Like I run into people and go, dude, I lost 100 pounds from your pocket. Okay. Another guy. It's almost like a job.

Speaker 2:          01:45:59       Like, I mean you tweeted out that I was coming on the podcast and there's like 50 comments after that about hulk loads all about the hulk load. Well, I added beats to the whole clothes because of you. You recommended. Yeah. Beats will get you out of bed in the morning. He eats are fantastic. That's the ultimate like preworkout boost. What a nutrient rich plant that is a root does. They're amazing. Just like the first time you do it though, don't freak out the first time you take a dump. All bloody red beets. Yeah, I know. It's crazy. It's actually done. You go to the store and you get, you get the beats right and you put them on the thing and like unless you say otherwise they are going to cut the, the beet Greens off and throw them away. That's the good stuff, man. That's also good as well.

Speaker 3:          01:46:45       Well yeah, it's definitely good as well. I mean I don't know why people don't think that's edible. Isn't that strange?

Speaker 5:          01:46:50       So we just have this idea that we were very rigid and like our idea, like what you eat, what you don't eat like that, just throw that out, chop that off. A beet. Greens are awesome and they don't taste bad. It's not like it's a, it's weird. You don't, you never see a beat green salad. That's not, that's not common to at our house. Joe Rogan. Whoa. Richard called me out. Um, what are, what are some other like, here's a funny thing on. I fucking saw the other data foods. Bok Choy is the new Kale, Bok Choy. You Fox. That's good too. It's not just the new Kale. What is that? Why do people have to do that? One of their ruined everything when they're nonsense. Just orange and black. We live in a commercial, you know, we live in a commercial society right there. They got to push something else out there.

Speaker 5:          01:47:39       I don't know, you know, it's the same thing that, you know, there's a white bus fleet. Buzzfeed is always, you know, there's crazy headlines about crazy stuff that's inflammatory and whatever. Click bait like. Exactly. Yeah. Do you grow your own vegetables? That's our next thing that we're looking into and we have a bunch of land so I as underutilized and, and so we just started meeting with a bunch of people to start. Start growing. Yeah, it, we've been doing that for awhile now at my house and it's was very rewarding to have like a, we had a cucumber salad the other day, cucumber, tomato salad. It was so good. It was like this. I saw this when it was a fucking seed in a little container and put it in the dirt. And um, what do you use for to. Oh, you don't grow so you don't have like A.

Speaker 5:          01:48:24       Yeah, we're, we're, I mean, you know, we'll, we'll get into that once we start growing, but the one thing that we are doing, which is fucking awesome is a, we started, um, we have, we have all these uh, beehives now we have like 30 hives that our house that we're hosting for a friend who is like an organic beekeeper who creates his own honey. And that's been super interesting also for the kids to like learn about, you know, what that's all about. I mean that is so interesting. That's cool. Works, which is really cool. I want to do that. And I also, I was thinking about doing that. I was like, God, it's a lot of work and bringing the fucking beehive guy and all, but I found out about this new invention. Yeah. This guy that Australia is created, you've seen it all the tap.

Speaker 5:          01:49:08       It's the. Yeah. He had like the craziest kickstarter of all time. He raised like insane millions of dollars. He was only trying to raise 100 grand or 200 grand or something and you've raised $4 million dollars in like no time because it's in his invention is so astounding. Well, I was definitely a part of that because when I got it, it wasn't nearly that much. I, I've, I tweeted the shit out of that. I thought it was amazing. It's a, you take have. You actually probably had a lot to do with him raising all a little bit of something interesting. I'm sure a lot of people reacted the way I will look. The 100 percent of what had to do with it was this invention is amazing. Twelve dollars million. Holy Shit Dude. When I looked at it, I swear to God, I don't think it was more than a couple hundred thousand dollars.

Speaker 5:          01:49:48       I mean, I think I looked, I looked at it maybe a couple of weeks ago and I think it was like at four, which is a lot. That's amazing, but it just shows how cool it is a good idea, you know, play it because it's really amazing. If anybody hasn't heard, well, you know the people that are listening, you're, you're only going to hear it, but this guy invented a beehive that essentially has a. there's a dial that you can turn and the dial changes the honeycombs into a flow pattern. It actually opens up and then the honey drips down slowly into these jars. It doesn't disturb the BS. It doesn't disturb any of the normal natural processes that these bees engage in to make honey and it's so much less invasive and when you see it, if you go to the video, it's called flow hive. If you go to the video online and they'll do a much better job of explaining how all this is made, but it's a. it's really fucking cool, right? Indiegogo, indiegogo campaign, but you don't get the bee pollen and uh, you don't get the, uh, the actual honeycomb itself, which I like to eat.

Speaker 4:          01:50:57       I love that stuff. Yeah. I mean, the idea is that you're not disturbing the bees, right? You're not really invading their, you're not impeding on their kind of habitat.

Speaker 5:          01:51:06       Was that funny Vegan now because honey wasn't Vegan for a long

Speaker 4:          01:51:09       time. I mean, look, there are, there is a hardcore Vegan perspective that, that honey, you know, you shouldn't eat honey animal product, um, but it's not. And I respect people that have that opinion. I mean, I think that, you know, my perspective on it is, is that, you know, our bee populations are threatened and because of, you know, he has to be in fucking idiots and you know, we've, we've fucked a lot of shit up, right? Phones too. Right? And so I think that, that, you know, our family is trying to be of service by helping foster, you know, co the cultivation of bee populations and uh, you know, in a sustainable way like by being, by getting involved, you know, there's one, there's one school of thought like we'll leave it alone, right. But this is a, this is a threatened, you know, population that needs a little bit of know, graceful intervention were to help help them foster their population. So to the extent that I can play a small part in that, I think that's a cool thing.

Speaker 5:          01:52:16       No, I think that's a cool thing as well. And I, and I agree, there's, there's that, the very hardcore a segment of the Vegan population that don't think that you should eat honey, but they don't have it like this, you know, this is like, normally when you get honey, it's like this really complicated process. You have to pull the, the hives out and you have to scrape the honey off and extract it in that way. This is, it's totally different. It's a different animal than commercial honey production. You, there's

Speaker 4:          01:52:46       practices involved with that that are harmful to those insects, right? So to the extent that you can find a better way to do it, um, where you're still able to harvest the honey in a way that, that is not, you know, kind of overly tapping into what they need to survive and thrive. Um, I don't know. It's also, again, this is like, you know, it gets into like splitting hairs. It's like, all right, we're going to talk about this when we have, you know, when, you know, 55 percent of co two emissions is caused by animal agriculture. We have bigger fish to fry, bigger things like, so, you know, I'm just trying to kind of, you know, help bee populations in, in, in our tiny little way by educating my kids about it. And by being a home to these 40 hives, which is a trip.

Speaker 4:          01:53:32       It's a lot of hives, 40 hives, you have eli, how there's this. They're like, I think they stack them for high. So there's 10 of those 10 bottles. Towers. Yeah, down the hill, I dunno, three or four feet high. Um, and it was, they brought them in the middle of the night and it was like, okay, like are we going to have swarming be, you know, as they're going to be like we were like, don't go near them for a couple days, like let them acclimate, you know, they have to get used to like their environment and what sorts of. I mean, the way that bee populations function is a trip

Speaker 3:          01:54:05       is really trippy. The little aliens. Do you have to plan specific flowers around your area to help them? We haven't had,

Speaker 4:          01:54:11       did you that? I mean the big kind of hurdle that we had to get over was making sure that we had adequate water supply for them. But I'm not that I'm aware of.

Speaker 3:          01:54:19       We have in our, on our property we have specific plants and flowers that attract bees and the other ones that attract hummingbirds. We have a lot of hummingbirds on our property just because of that because we put certain, certain plants and flowers. But the bees have a real issue apparently with cell phones. Um, I was reading this whole thing about how the towers like impact them some, the actual signals themselves, they, they impact the bees' ability to communicate. They fuck with their head. They can hear that shit.

Speaker 4:          01:54:49       It wouldn't surprise me and the way that they have the high, they literally have the hive mind and the way that they, they sort of functioned in that way. Like the, you know, the frequency at which they're communicating is so mysterious and amazing.

Speaker 3:          01:55:03       Yeah. So it's so cool. I've told this story before, but you might not have heard it. When we were on fear factor, one of the stunts they had these people, they're the data get handcuffed to a pole or something like that. And then we covered them with bs and while we're doing this, the beekeeper told us that we had to stop filming because a local population of bees had came over to investigate his population of bees and they were above us in this cloud, in the air, sorting it out. They weren't fighting. They were somehow or another communicating like, who the fuck are you guys? Oh man, we're here for a TV show. Okay, so you're not moving in? No, we're not moving in. Are you guys

Speaker 5:          01:55:44       taking our pollen? No, we're not taking your pile. Like and they had an, they worked it out. They worked it out and then they disappeared and then we kept filming but it took, we had an amazing. It was really cool. It was really cool to watch because it was like what is going on and not, you know, and I mean everybody was, it was weird how people were interested in it because Oh we got to stop filming apparently like those local bee populations intermix with this be published. And I was like, what? First of all I was high as fuck. So it was super, super interesting to me. So I was like, wait a minute, wait a minute. When they're talking like how do you know whose Beezer, who's bs? He goes and he was like, you could tell just by the way there they're swarming in the air or they're trying to work this out.

Speaker 5:          01:56:24       And so there was this small cloud of these bees because he had brought a lot of bees and the local bees got together with his bees and they were hovering, but they had to disperse like they told everyone to get away. They told the crew to get away. Everyone leave the area, you know, he wanted to make sure that there was nothing fucking with this interaction. This strange because he has. You have like the BBC. Yeah, he will. He's a deep respect for bees. This guy really does love bees was really, really interesting. It was interesting for me too because I was covered with bees and that episode. I mean they were all over my hair, my face and my arms and everything like that and I never got stung. Gets done. A couple people got stung on the set, but I don't know what happened.

Speaker 5:          01:57:06       It could have been like, you know, like maybe if like a bs in your armpit and you, you, you move your arm and it gets trapped and it's like fuck this and it stings you. Probably just just accidental circumstances that came from having millions or thousands or whatever it was. Right, right. That's pretty interesting. Yeah, it was really cool. It was really cool seeing them all get together and try to figure it out and just flying overhead. Just communicating in some way that we just really don't even have a clue. We believe pheromones are involved, but we also know that there's some sort of signal that they're sending out and we just don't know what it is. You know? This whole insect world is a real trip. I mean they really are alien. They really are some strange alien life form. We found them on another planet.

Speaker 5:          01:57:52       We will be blown away. Yeah. I mean just the idea that there's a queen and, and, and, and the fact that the hive is lost without it. Yeah. And that everything kind of falls into place when the, when the queen is inserted into the population. I mean, I can't begin to, you know, like I know very little about this. How about the Queens? A murderous bitch. She's got a fucking Stinger that doesn't come off. It doesn't, she doesn't have like barbs on it the way everyone else does and what she does is she wanders around the hive looking for female babies and she stabs him right through the honeycomb. Yeah, that's what the female users. Oh, it's awful. She's fucking heartless cunt. And one day she will be usurped. There were a new female will come along and kick her ass and that's it. But right now

Speaker 3:          01:58:42       she's going to stab those babies. So she runs around like sticking her needle and the honeycomb when she smells a female fucking girl in there and take my spot. No threat to the throne. Yeah. It's very bizarre. World of bugs. Have you ever seen the leaf cutter ant a documentary? They did where they, they cemented, they poured cement through this leaf cutter ant hive, this enormous hill. And then they dug it out and structure. It was incredibly labyrinthine right? And it went, it was vast. It was huge, huge and incredibly complex. Like they had areas where these leaves would ferment and then they had pipes that led tubes that lead through to the sky or to the, uh, the surface area where they would hit air so that they could the fermentation process, the gases can be released. Yeah. That's crazy. Like with these tiny brains figure out like we don't even know like, well, human beings would fuck that up and it makes sense for sure.

Speaker 3:          01:59:51       Unions will get involved. And there it is again. Look at that. Oh right. Yeah, I did. I did see this industry in the rain forest. Right. It's like they did an archeological dig to like extract it, right? Yeah. They filled it up with cement and I mean, first of all, it's an enormous. When you look at how wide it is, it's probably 50 feet wide and it's insane. It's very deep as well. And there's so much to it. There's so much going on there. And how are they communicating with who was the architect of all this structure? How did they figure this out? We all know how to do this. Like what in the fuck man. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. And a huge fucking mystery. And until a decade or two ago we had no idea what the fuck was even below the surface. We had no idea what they were doing down there.

Speaker 3:          02:00:44       I mean it really is amazing. It is just absolutely amazing. Have you seen the ant death spiral? Have you ever seen that now? Well that's a trip. It like king of the obscure animal video. So I do remember it. Spring free time. And I love to watch a animal nature videos cause I think it's very under appreciated. The, the uniqueness or the just the, just the eccentricities of the animal world. Just how amazing and fascinating. What is that it is that crazy? A rodent that looks like a few bar. Yeah. Did you see that one where they're climbing into a hot tub? Like this hot tub party? There's an animal. There's an amazing. Alright, this is an ant carol. And this is when the queen dies. When the queen dies and the scent is no longer there. They don't know who to follow, don't know what the fuck to do.

Speaker 5:          02:01:40       And they go into this spiral and they will just do this until they run out of energy and food and they will fucking die is probably literally shitty job. They'll just continue to spend like that until they just parish. Yeah. Yeah. They don't know where to go. They don't know who to follow. I mean there's a, there's a hierarchy in the ant community. Uh, I'm sure it could be explained cve, find an explanation for Jamie. I probably butchered it, but the, the idea being that they're following the scent of the Queen and somehow or another lose it. And so they don't know what to do. So they just start going into the spiral. Maybe someone stepped on the queen or something happened. They removed the queen perhaps. And a bird might've stolen the queen like a dragon come down, swoop and take away their queen.

Speaker 5:          02:02:28       Now. World's crazy mysterious place. Well, insects in particular, could we, we, we know we don't think of him that much because they're so small, but ants have the almost exact same calculated biomass as human beings when it comes to weight, meaning that there is exactly the same amount of ant weight per the bodies of ants on earth is there are humans. Oh, you mean in total total. Like if you added up all the ants and all the humans, that the, the total mass would be the equal. Yeah, that's crazy. That's so many answer are how many fucking answers it take to equal 180 pound person. It's got to be a lot. What's the average height or weight of a person? It's probably somewhere around there, like one 60 or something like that. You know, between men and women. Not In the US. Yeah, it's like a hundred pounds more than that, right? The average. It was a how to make ants commit suicide. We go into a spiral. You can make them do it. Why would you do that? Dick?

Speaker 5:          02:03:31       Simply divert the ants into an enclosed space such as a plant pot, large discovers a staggering 1000, 200 feet in diameter with each ant completing a circuit every two and a half hours. Holy Shit. Whoa. So you can make them do it that I'm able to break free owing to their lack of sight and they march around in a loop until they dropped dead. What does it say before that explains it? How do they remove the army? Has Navigate by following the pheromone trails left behind by others. However, should enough of them lose the scent, they begin to follow the aunt immediately in front of them and a huge ant spiral forums. Ah, it. Follow the scent of those in front of them. Lots of fucking trip. And how weird. It was weird that not only did nature somehow or another have a need for this, but it, you know, it came about, it developed and it's been the same way that way for who knows how many of years.

Speaker 5:          02:04:37       What is the evolutionary purpose of that though? Just they follow each other. They can't see shit, but who the fuck is the first guy who? What does he know? How does he know what he's doing? Should go and deep joe believes in making these from fermentation bowls and the ground and like, wow, trippy fucking world. The insect world is the insect world to me is one of the most bizarre world or the most overlooked because they're so small. We don't think of him as as alien as they truly are. You know, if an ant was the size of a dog, it would be the fuck. I mean, it's downright prehistoric. Oh, beyond? Yeah. I mean they're, they're prehistoric. Even to dinosaurs. Dinosaurs. Look at answering. What the fuck is that crazy thing with an exoskeleton with unbelievable physical strength. Physical strength than an man has.

Speaker 5:          02:05:29       The power to weight ratio is pretty off the charts. Oh, it's incredible. Incredible. I'm you ever seen ants carry large things away, which is what the fuck, man. Now the world is a ruthless, evil vicious world to ever see when the female ants get ahold of vyvanse leaf cutters as well, to get a hold of a male. Males are larger and they have wings, might be not be leaf cutters, but whatever it is, they chopped the wings off of the male, chop his arms and legs and then carry him to the, to the hive to breed. I haven't seen that bitches so rude. I had to bone up on my nature videos, I think. Yeah, I probably have to bone down. You probably have too many of them in there. Too much useless information. You have the time, Joe. I don't know. I don't know where it comes from.

Speaker 5:          02:06:16       I just, I get compelled to research things and to follow up and to start reading and watching things. And then next thing you know them have gone on this crazy cycle. Is that a? Yeah. What kind of answered is the biggest answer? Two and a half inches. Oh, that's a big ass aunt. Well, if you ever seen with wings, my friend Brian Cowen at one point in time was studying to be a scientist and uh, he would, he had spent some time in a rain forest, I think it was Borneo, a new New Guinea and forget what it was, but they had to. Everyone stayed in these tents and he's elevated platforms. They had a coat. The posts with Turpentine. Yeah, because there were so many ants and if the army ants found you, if they found you in one of them decided to bite you just like they follow the, sent millions and millions and millions and they would just eat you alive. And people would regularly get killed by ants there. That's crazy. How about the fact they kill elephants? They climb up the elephant's leg, they find the ear and they start eating the fucking elephant's brain and then they all fall ascent and they all follow. Go up the elephant body and eat his fucking brain alive from the inside and kill a lot of things you wouldn't think.

Speaker 4:          02:07:38       Well, it, it's all you have to do is leave like something out on your kitchen counter for five minutes and out of mysterious nowhere. A line of ants will appear and then, and then if you remove it, they disappear.

Speaker 5:          02:07:51       Well, have you ever seen something outside that wasn't there before and then all of a sudden the flies find it and then within minutes there's all these fucking flies. There was no flies and then within minutes they find this and somehow in or they go, Yo, Yo, Yo, here we go, we've got something. And then there's all these fucking flies. It's very like, how do they do in that? We don't even know. We have no idea. I don't know. We got diverted. You need. I know you need a insect ologist. Is that what they would be called? Come on, sort of a word for that. What does it show? Entomologist emojis. That's right. Is that what it is? Yeah. What's the study of words? The origins of words at technology. Etymology. Don't get confused. They'll order one and get the other. I'm trying to find out the origin of the word cunt. Well, I didn't know about bugs. I don't know what you're trying to. A lot of layers to that. Brian Callahan. What compelled him to want to study that? I don't know. There's a lot of layers to Brian. Brian's a deep dude. You know, you start getting to know him. You dig deeper and deeper and deeper. You find those educational background and he's a. He knows a lot of shit about weird stuff, you know? Yeah. Yeah. But that, that freaked him out. He said he could hear the marching ants. You hear them more?

Speaker 4:          02:09:08       Yeah. That's crazy. So many of them on the floor that you just, you realize like, oh my God is millions of them. You were talking about how you're a huge radio lab fan, right? Yes. Have you, have you gotten down with this show, invisibilia? No. It was pretty cool, man. I think he would dig it. Is that a difference in other different podcasts? It's another one of those invasive invisibilia. It's another kind of NPR offshoot, you know, like how sort of IRA glass at this American life. All these producers that have worked for him have now started all these other podcasts. I'm super interesting stories. There was one recently about a guy who I guess is a pretty well known guy. Um, he's blind. I think he went blind as far as it like a four year old or something like that. He lost his sight and he started in school.

Speaker 4:          02:09:58       He started making these like clicking noises with his mouth like, like that. And his teachers would say, you know, what are you doing? Settle Down, stop doing that. And his mother realized very early on that there was some purpose to this. There was some reason why he was doing this show location. Yeah. And, and what they realized is that he was developing over many years of practicing this, like a finely attuned sonar ability. Like he would literally be able to, uh, figure out like where he was and what was in a room and what was going on. Basically making these clicking noises in the, in the, in the sound waves bouncing off. And he developed this acuity to be able to discern from that the parameters of his environment to the extent that he, he like goes running. He like rides a bike. It's insane. Like what this guy has been able to do as a blind person.

Speaker 4:          02:10:54       He goes running and his whole thing is. His whole thing is that he doesn't think that he's anything special. He thinks that all blind people could develop this skill, but that our education around blindness is sort of, um, a, a vernacular of disability, right? We're where we say, well, you're disabled. You can't do this and we're going to put you into this system and this is how we do it with blind people. And he's like, that's bullshit. Like everybody could learn to do what I'm doing. We need to like empower blind people in this way. It's super interesting. It was like a long interview with this guy. But anyway, each week they have some kind of interesting story like that.

Speaker 5:          02:11:33       Well, there was a video of a young kid who can do that. A young kid who walks on the street makes a clicking noises and he knows we're trash cans are and stuff. That's crazy, right? Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:11:43       Well, so, so like the, the latent abilities that we all have, right? If we develop them, it's sort of like how the disability unlocks some other aspect of your brain that that needs to develop in order to survive.

Speaker 5:          02:11:55       One of the best pool players in the world is a young man named Shane van Boning and he's deaf. It's been deaf since birth. And when he plays, he shuts his hearing aid off and it allows some trademark look at this. Oh, that's the guy that Sam is a different guy than the other guy was a young black guy. Right? So this is the guy from the, from that podcast. So is he doing okay? Kish?

Speaker 6:          02:12:16       Completely blind. In fact, he doesn't even have eyes say for prosthetic ones. Daniel has never seen a tree, a car, or even the bicycle he's writing. So how does he know where he's going? He's literally driving on the street traffic. The answer can be found in the clicking sound. You hear it's called Echo location. Bats use it to fly around in the dark and dolphins use it to navigate the oceans. Daniel uses echolocation or sound to see every environment has its own acoustical signature. Every surface has its own acoustical signature. Daniel was born with an aggressive form of cancer called retinoblastoma. By the time he was 13 months old, both of his eyes were removed. Your 45, so you lost your sight at such a young age. You don't have any, any memory of vision? I have no memories at all. I was using echolocation from the age of two or younger, but I really didn't know that much about it. It was just how you. How you adapted to your environment without really understanding it. Yes. I doubt very seriously that most sighted people give much thought or attention about how they see, so I really didn't give thought or attention about how I see Daniel uses echolocation to right

Speaker 1:          02:13:35       bike

Speaker 6:          02:13:38       cook. Is this a dish that you normally cook Daniel, or are you experimenting with me?

Speaker 6:          02:13:47       Even hike alone in the mountains using sound to see can be a hard concept for a sighted person to understand what the father, Daniel, will tell you. He sees his environment as a series of images created in his mind based on what he hears using echolocation, so you're calling out into the environment, you're essentially asking the environment, what are you and where are you, and you're receiving those answers so you're getting an image in your mind. Yes, I definitely get a three dimensional images with depth and character and richness and I can process those and I can interact with those from his modest bungalow in long beach. Daniel runs a small nonprofit called world access for the blind. Since being established in 2000 world access has been the lone voice preaching echolocation. In fact, every major blind organization in America does not support Daniel's mission. So Daniel, the national federation of the blind, will say that echo location is just too complicated for for most blind people to grasp. It's not so much the federation that's that's a concern you have here, a blinded ms dot profession. The blindness field who by and large really kind of interactively remains committed, if you will, to a traditional approach, which is about, in my opinion, restriction. It is about this is how you do things, this is the right way for a blind person to do things. This is safe, this isn't safe.

Speaker 2:          02:15:38       Watching that guy drive his bike is a fucking trip. That is bizarre. Right? And so you watch that and it makes you just think about human capability in a different way. Well, it certainly does. It certainly makes you wonder like what? What else we could do, you know, if we could figure that out, if, if, if there's a person like him that can figure out how to see things with his sound were making echo locations. Like what, what other, what other possible senses could be developed? And to that extent, you know, well in the animal kingdom there's like art, they training these German shepherds that can smell cancer like early onset of cancer. They're doing similar things with rats and you know, I mean obviously those animals have a more developed sense in that area, but to the extent that human beings have unlocked potential in areas that we haven't really looked at, I think it's pretty interesting.

Speaker 2:          02:16:42       Well, people certainly have finally developed senses like certain people that play instruments have finally developed senses of sound. Somalis have finally developed sense of tastes like he ever talked to someone who's like a real wind, Somalia and they can, they can drink a glass of wine, have a sip of it and tell you what part of the world he came from. Like that's real. That means they can sip it and tell you what part of France there they're growing these fucking grapes there. These people with crazy noses that work in the perfume industry that are highly paid to, you know, decipher these accents. It's like something I couldn't even relate to, but I think in general, you know, a need is the mother of that invention. Like somebody who's not in Daniel's condition is not on their own going to develop echolocation. Right. You know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          02:17:34       It also makes you really wonder if there are fields, like we were talking about how bees can tune into the sound that a cell phone makes and it fucks with them. I wonder if there's anything like that that's effecting us and social sort of a strange way that we're not aware of because one of the things that I'm always like really aware of when I go, if I go to the wilderness, if I go to a real wild place is this sound of it is different than the sound of silence here. Like if you're in a park here and it's beautiful, it's nature's, it's nice, it's relaxing, but there's a certain tone to like Prince of Wales Island in Alaska is a perfect example. We were there and we were on top of this mountain. We're sitting there. I was like, you hear that. Like it's like, it sounds different.

Speaker 2:          02:18:21       It feels different here. It's like you're getting a signal of no signal. There's no cell phone, there's no radio. You're not tuning into anything other than nature itself and it has a different tone to it than a city has. Well for sure. I mean, I would say that there's, you're saying there's no signal, but I think there's probably a really powerful signal. It's just a different signal goes the wrong way to say it. Yeah. You know, listen, everything is vibration and energy and if you don't think that, that, uh, that isn't real, you know, go hang out with negative people for a week and see how you start behaving. So trying to, you know, an environment is no different and we tend to believe that if we can't see something that it's not real. So here's, you know, Daniel, who you know is putting out sound waves into the world and he's able to figure out what his environment is. You can't see that. He can't see that. But to him it's very real and you know, we're surrounded by all kinds of crazy invisible energies in waves from cell towers to

Speaker 4:          02:19:28       Wifi signals and all this kind of stuff. I mean, do we know how this is impacting us? I know people that are super sensitive to, to, uh, to Wifi and cell phones, like they get headaches and all kinds of things.

Speaker 3:          02:19:41       So what is this Jamie? Students Science experiment finds plants won't grow near Wifi router.

Speaker 7:          02:19:47       Some ninth graders in Denmark did a test where they put what they said was, are they tested a. it's the same radiation of cell phone gives off. So they put some watercress I think is what it's called, or garden crest and six trays in one room, six trays and another with two wifi routers and essentially as you can send a picture, didn't grow.

Speaker 3:          02:20:07       The ones in the Wifi routers is no different in the environment other than the fact that Wifi routers were there. Yeah, that ain't good. That's frightening. It is. Twelve days of growth and then it totally makes sense. I mean there's a signal if your phone can pick up that signal, there is something in the air and that something in the air is probably disruptive to other things that are also in the air.

Speaker 4:          02:20:30       Yeah. That's fucking up the BS. What's it doing to your brain?

Speaker 3:          02:20:33       Exactly right. It feels different man. When you go to a place with no cell phone signal, it literally feels different and it's so rare that we do that. So rare, yeah, but it's not just, it's not just the cell phone signal. I mean it's all kinds of things. People give off a certain signal to. People want to think that that's hippy and woo woo, but man, when you're around really negative people that are going to go away from this person and it's not just, you got to get away from them because they say certain things like they give off a vibe, you know, that that's like, that's a hippie thing to say the vibes guys giving me a bad vibe man. But I think it's real. I think there are certain rules.

Speaker 4:          02:21:14       You walk into a room and you're like, well, there's a heavy energy and you know, there's something weird. It doesn't feel right to me. You know? I got, you get, you get, you get like anxious and you got to leave. Yeah, right. Everybody's had that experience.

Speaker 3:          02:21:27       Well that's why nobody wants to buy a house where someone was killed in it. The house is awesome. You find out that there was like a double homicide there. You're like, fuck this place.

Speaker 4:          02:21:37       Have you ever been up in, uh, towards Simi? Um, that like dry lake bed in Chatsworth? Yes. What's that Canyon called? Right there. That's creepy. I'm Tapo. No, no, no. I Dunno. You know what I'm talking. I, you're talking about though, like I've written my, I ride my bike all, you know, I could do a lot of training around here and I've written up that canyon. It's a great client, but like there's something weird, you know, you can feel like a weird energy and it turns out that box, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Box Canyon. Yeah. And like, um, what's that chance and family? Um, yeah, there was like the mansons were back there and also there are, I think it's Boeing is back there. Yes. Contractors where they were doing nuclear testing in the ground, which is why that's a dry lake bed and there's still people that

Speaker 2:          02:22:26       will tell you that they're, you know, it's not so safe there. They, they, they did some shit out there, you know. Well they definitely did some shit there. And not only that, there was some in, in seeing me, there were some water well tasks that they did that found traces of rocket fuel in the water. Well, and there's a cleanup that's going on up there right now is a really susanna pass. People are worried about that clean up because they're worried about is that if they start digging and cleaning up that the dust is going to get into the air and it's going to blow through the valley and whatever trace elements of that rocket fuel. Apparently there was a lot of disasters up there. They did a lot of shit down there in the fifties and the sixties. Early testing on stuff. Yeah. They had like some sort of a nuclear thing there as well.

Speaker 2:          02:23:11       Apparently there was a nuclear incidents much worse than three miles worse than three mile island. Really? In 1959 they had something worse than through my own. Huh? La Apparent. I read a study on it though and one of the things that said the study like the half life of the type of radiation that they have is very short lived. So it's not something that lingers in an area. The real concern that the apparently according to what I read, that the sober environmentalist are concerned with is the rocket fuel that's leaked into the ground and gotten into the well water in that area. That's the real concern. Is that. Is that why the lake that is dry? I don't know. I've no idea whether they pose try. Interesting. I, I knew a dude who lived near a golf course and the pesticides from the golf course leaked into the well and he got cancer.

Speaker 2:          02:24:05       His neighbor guard cancer kids in his neighborhood. It was like all throughout the neighborhood, people got cancer, they got cancer because of the pesticides. Like they all got a very specific type of bone cancer. Scary Shit. Like he doesn't have a femur. One of his femurs is like a metal rod that they replaced his femur with because he had cancer. That's crazy. Yeah. And it's from pesticides. There was a big class action. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know what, what the fuck went down, but you know, bone cancer from a golf course. Fuck, you know. Imagine what our rocket facility they're dumping, what kind of Shit they're dumping into that fucking ground. Kidding, right. I mean, you know, our world is getting more and more toxic, right? All these things we have to worry about. Think about, think about, you know, look on the back of, you know, the average package food that you pick up at the grocery store and all the ingredients in it and like, you know, who knows what all that stuff is, whether it's safe and we're interesting regulatory bodies to make these decisions for us. Right. How about meditation? Yeah, of course. Right. Hold on. New Medications are constantly coming out. Side effects. I mean the commercials are just comedic, you know, like literally way more disclosures about side effects than actual product information. Yeah. We played one for acne medicine the other day. That was hilarious. Well, because there was this like suicidal,

Speaker 5:          02:25:24       not just suicide. They were talking about bloody diarrhea. They had these really pretty girls and they were walking down the street. There were bopping. One of the girls in that commercial, the redheaded girl contacted me on twitter. They had no idea what the fuck they were selling, you know, they're just trying to be pretty, you know, they don't, they're not talking in the commercial, right, but they're bopping down the street to that forelle song happy and uh, they have like beautiful skin and beautiful hair and they're perfect bone structure and they literally like bopping as they're walking, like they're in some happy music video. And then as they're doing that, the, the start reading the laundry list of possible potential side effects that are fatal bloody diarrhea, stomach cramps, all these different things. And they're very specific which could be fatal just because you're getting zits.

Speaker 5:          02:26:09       And again, like you're saying like you're looking back on the couch watching this. I mean we've signed up for this. I mean the Orwellian dystopia and he's like weirder than you could've ever imagined. Right. And again, what you were talking about earlier is you're using a medication to deal with an issue that if you take a holistic approach, what's causing you to have acne, right? What is causing your skin to break out and some sort of a horrible way that you need this fucking bloody diarrhea inducing medication to combat it? Yeah. I mean at some point you know the side effects far outweigh the condition that you're trying to treat and they're too bloody diarrhea. There's. There isn't even a single thought put into the cars. Like why don't we talk about what might be leading to this and maybe some choices that you could make that could alleviate or prevent this.

Speaker 5:          02:27:02       No, just take this. Well, you can't make any money with those choices. Joy, you're bloody diarrhea. There's only one way to make the money was the way to make the money is you gotta you gotta sell the stuff. You don't. You don't make money by getting people and you can. You can write a book book, make some money. It's not going to make us money. Money is accutane or some point. Know that Broccoli growers need to unite. Yeah. Imagine if there was like a plant that cured zits is one plant. Boy, would they make that plan illegal? Quick crutching on all the advisors. Profits are so, yeah, all that. What is that stuff? The benzoyl peroxide, the stuff is all that money. Oh yeah. All that does is to see 10 dries your skin out. So it does. It's all a puskus gets dried out and your skin feels like shit. Yeah, I mean look, you know, western medicine is fantastic if you have an acute disorder. I'm not like, you know, against Western medicine or pharmaceuticals when appropriate. I just think that that, you know, we're too quick to take them to deal with things that might be better addressed in other ways. I agree. And it's also as. Why's it have to be one of the other wise, it has to be pharmaceutical drugs are evil or they're great. No, it's like sometimes

Speaker 3:          02:28:22       they're great and sometimes they're evil and you know, the problem is profit. Once profit gets in the way, our profit gets into the mix. That'd becomes a soul thing you're chasing. It's not like let's make sure that what we're doing is the most beneficial to society and to human beings possible. No, let's make sure we make a fuck load of money, the most money we could possibly make because getting something passed by the FDA is a huge process that cost millions and millions of dollars. So by the time you actually do get a product to market you, you, you have to protect that product. You have to protect that, that money. It's all about money, money and profit. The best thing to do is just

Speaker 4:          02:28:58       be proactive enough about your health so that you can do whatever is under your control to prevent you from getting any kind of acute disease. Not to say that it doesn't happen because of course it does, but, um, you know, I think there's lots of things that, that could be more deeply explored that then, you know, our culture really is sort of per permittable too in kind of our, you know, what we accept as mainstream or not. Like I, I started recently a going to acupuncture, which I'd never done before. It was before. Yeah, I've done it. No, I didn't, I didn't think it was bullshit. I mean, you know, I'm a pretty rational guy, you know, so the idea of sticking, you know, sort of like the idea of Meridians and sticking needles into my forehead and I was like, I didn't really know I wasn't an immediate, you know, somebody who's going to immediately jump on that bandwagon, but I know a lot of people who have benefited from it and I was having some things that I want to address, like particularly sleep.

Speaker 4:          02:29:56       Like I've been challenged by sleep lately and so I went to see my friend who's a Chinese medicine doctor and he started doing it on me and it was hell. It was really helpful. It was really helpful. And it's interesting, the idea of balancing energy systems and you know, kind of how it works. I mean so ornate and, and this, you know, my friend who's studying Chinese medicine and he's still kind of in his residency, so he's working underneath like a, this Chinese dude who's been practicing this forever and they come in and the guy literally the, this, this, this Chinese medicine doctor. The only thing he wants to do is take my pulse on both wrists and he, he takes it with his thumb and a couple different places and apparently his touch is so finely attuned that he, he can tell all kinds of things about like where you're at based upon the pressure of your pulse and you know, the frequency and the tempo and all these sorts of things. So he wants to do that and then he wants to look at, uh, your tongue and he could tell by looking at your tongue, like all sorts of crazy shit about where you're at. Disney for. Interesting people love it. Or do you believe in possible placebo effect? I think the placebo effect is powerful. You know, I'm, I'm into trying anything, you know, why not right? Like, you know, contempt prior to investigation. That's a good way to get. Get hoodwinked. Yeah. Something's got to happen. Well, I mean I think with, but

Speaker 3:          02:31:20       is that better than saying I'm not going to explore that because I think it's bs without having any direct experience. But I mean it's nice to have some sort of proof something. So how do you, how do you, how do you prove that, you know, you run some tests, some tests on what have the guy proved that they can actually do that? Oh yeah. Well, I mean all I can tell you is that I was having issues with sleep and relaxation and this seemed to benefit and alleviate my problem to some extent. So we don't use that placebo is that the herbs that he prescribed me, is that the acupuncture? It certainly could be those things because you've got to think about like sleep. Oftentimes a psychological. Oftentimes sleep is a matter of your ability to relax and we've all been in that situation before when you know you have to be at work and five hours.

Speaker 3:          02:32:05       If I go to sleep right now, I can get four hours sleep and you look at that clock and for whatever reason you, you're stuck in that thing because you know that you have to go to sleep right this moment and the pressure of that keeps you awake. Even if you're tired. If you take action to try to alleviate that by acupuncture, by water, whatever it is, they just, the mere act of taking action will shift your focus into a cure and you can oftentimes start thinking that whatever this placebo effect is real, I'm not doubting that this guy has a real app, a possible a gift or whatever it is, but wouldn't it be nice that we can prove it? Like, wouldn't you want to prove that? What do you want to just work with a bunch of people and find out, uh Oh look, you know, he's right.

Speaker 3:          02:32:48       This guy doesn't have a gallbladder issue where he's right, this guy does. I just met a lot of fuckers doing your zone of healers and all these becoming a much more cynical about this kind of stuff. Even before that, I. There was a guy that was working with all these mma guys that I know and it was a zone healer and a, he would press the back of your head and tell you from the spots that he was pressing what was wrong with you and that. But it was bullshit. Like he, he was like, press harder here. Does that hurt when I do that? I'm like, yeah, because you press in harder stupid. I'm dumb. And like we had this conversation. I'm like, how is it? How exactly is this working? And he was like, well, your body's ability to heal itself is dependent upon freeing your energy and is how does that work?

Speaker 3:          02:33:30       How does that work? How does that work? And after badgering them with a bunch of different questions, the essentially admitted it was all placebo effect. I was like Jesus fucking Christ, and he was charging like 160 bucks to get adjusted and he would touch your head. Was this part of your show or to do that? I knew that was in the mixed martial arts world who was dealing with all these different fighters and Jujitsu guys that had back injuries, neck and it was a good chiropractor, but this zone healing thing, as he was getting into it, the more I would like listen to it, I was like, okay, what? What do you. You're telling me you could touch the back of someone's head and press spots and tell if they have a thyroid condition the fuck out of here. That's not true. That's just not true, and he kind of admitted it wasn't true.

Speaker 3:          02:34:12       He kind of admitted that ultimately what he's doing is if you believe in what he's doing, it will fix what, what you have this wrong with you because ultimately there's another great a radiolab podcast on a placebo effect and there was one of them where they were talking about this guy. They hypnotized this kid with this insane work problem, skin warts. So if you've ever seen people that have worked all over their skin where they become, it becomes incurable by medication and they convinced this kid that they had hypnotized him and that it was going to go away and it went away on his arm. His arm was like completely free of warts, which has never happens. When someone reaches such an acute level of infection like this kid had and so in. In a sense, it is real in a sense. It's not who he is as long as you're gullible, as long as you're willing to wholeheartedly jump in and believe it, and I think that might be what's going on with acupuncture.

Speaker 3:          02:35:14       That might be what's going on with a lot of quote unquote Chinese medicine or eastern medicine. I think if you believe that they have found you a cure, your body starts producing whatever it actually needs to fix whatever ailment you have and thus it becomes actually effective. So the the method is not correct. The method is a trick and that trick is effective and that effective trick does convince your brain to fix whatever the problem is and it's really baffling and it only works if you're not a discerning critical person because if you're a discerning person who's skeptical, it's not going to work because then you're going to hyper analyze whatever it is or where the potential possibilities of whatever it is and it just won't. It won't work, which is weird.

Speaker 4:          02:36:04       There's no shortage of snake oil salesman pitching all kinds of crazy healing techniques, you know, no doubt. But I think that in fairness, you know, acupuncture and traditions of Chinese medicine east go back, you know, hundreds if not thousands of years, which critique there. Well, so does slavery. Yeah. But people are not going to see witchcraft doctors in west La. Well they wouldn't believe. So I think that it would, I think that the, the history and the, the sort of, um, traditions behind it, there is, there is merit there is there though. But one scientifically, I don't know. I mean I'm the wrong guy to ask about that. I think if you're the wrong guy to ask about that, you're probably the wrong guy to talk about it. Yeah, probably. Yeah, probably. But I think it's, I mean, listen, you know, I just know from my friend who's been studying as me, he's been in school for crazy long periods of time. But you say school, do you do air quotes? I think it's, you know, it's essentially like medical school was nothing like medical school. How about that are sticking needles in people, enlightened insights that in terms of like studying physiology and studying chemistry and organic chemistry and all that kinds of.

Speaker 3:          02:37:09       It was like on Energy Meridians and shock rose and all that jazz. Right. I mean, isn't that like what it's based on?

Speaker 5:          02:37:16       There's some aspects of that. Sure. But there's a lot of herbal medicine. I think too, you know, for whatever reason I thought you said urban medicine now, you know, verbal or the study of herbs. There's, there's certainly some herbs that have medicinal values. One of my favorite herbs has massive amounts of manipulate Oregano marijuana, the. But I just think that the sticking the needles in you, it's probably more that you're doing something, you're doing something to deal with it and then doing something your body reacts. You know, the weirdest thing that is kind of half of what like sort of psychotherapy is to the willingness to show up for it is to walk through the door and to engage somebody else is almost, you know, no doubt. Half the battle. Yeah, no doubt. There's definitely merit to that. I mean, and also like I said, like the idea of any, you know, fill in the blank whenever type of modality, any type of therapy that's actually effective, even though it doesn't have any real scientific basis to it, the, the effect is still real.

Speaker 5:          02:38:25       You still get a benefit from it. Like this zone healing shit. Like if you believe in it, it will affect you, which is kind of fucking crazy. It's kind of crazy that in some ways there's merit to it. Well, I mean let's just talk about meditation and Mindfulness Practices, right? So if you want to apply your sort of analytical perspective to that, you can draw the same conclusions and really I could tell you, well, I mean, listen, anybody who is a consistent who has a consistent meditation practice will tell you that it improves their life. Right? But do you know that a placebo, like is there a provable, you know, thing that you sort of, could you apply that same? Um, you know, litmus test to that because this is another sort of non western approach to, you know, being healthier. But there's been a lot of studies done on meditation.

Speaker 5:          02:39:20       I'm sure there's been a lot of studies done on the effectiveness of mindfulness and and the actual effect on the mind, but it's in a theoretical thing, right? Yes, but it's not lying to you. It's not saying that this frog potion that I give you is going to cure your cancer and then your body cures the cancer. There's a certain aspect of meditation that's undeniably beneficial, but that, that, that aspect of it is really been scientifically analyze. They've done all these f MRI scans on people that are Buddhist monks that have spent years and years meditation. They've done scans on people that were in, you know, deep rem sleep and different stages of the mind. I mean, there's. There's a lot of scientific work that's been done on what we call meditation, achieving certain brainwaves, achieving certain states. Those aren't fake

Speaker 3:          02:40:14       and in a sense, placebo effect isn't fake either, right? Because every drug that that exists exists because there's a receptive for it in the human mind. The reason why those drugs are effective is because the mind knows how to actually produce that effect in some sort of limited quantity on its own. That's one of the reasons why placebo effects work. That's the reason why we have opiate receptors, cannabinoid receptors and all these different things and processes that the mind can engage in with or without medication. That's why those medications have an effect on the body, so in that sense, placebos, if you believe in them work, there was really is something is there, isn't it even more than that though, like the placebo effect works. Even when you know it's a placebo sometimes, right? Sometimes we're not as much. There was, yeah. Yeah, there was and that's I think what we're talking about.

Speaker 3:          02:41:09       Just doing something. The act of doing something to deal with it makes you focus on whatever the issue is. You know, I mean how many issues that people have health wise or just due to a complete lack of awareness of their physical body. Just stumbling through life on this drunk and momentum of coffee and donuts and stress and cigarettes and traffic and pollution and stress and cigarettes and coffee, coughing, da bum ba bum, bum, bum, bum, bum. And then just the, just the mere act of taking the time to reassess, like what it means to be a person to, to just stop and pause and give thought to your, your day to day existence might be enough to reset a lot of the processes that are in place. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          02:41:57       I mean it's been huge in my life. I mean, it's so counterintuitive. Like I would rather go out and do a four hour run and sit down for 20 minutes in the morning before I leave the house and, and engage in that practice. And you know, over the last six or eight months I've really kind of dedicated myself to it in a, in a, in a, you know, by prioritizing it. And it's really, it has been great. What do you do? How do you do it? Um, you know, I've played around with so many different techniques over the years and you know, you were talking about momentum earlier, right? Like I've never been able to like hit momentum with it, like I'll do it for a couple of days, this version, that version and I could never find a way to really stick with it.

Speaker 4:          02:42:40       And I downloaded the headspace app which has an iphone APP. It's got guided meditation programs on it and it started by this dude, Andy Puddicombe who have had on my podcast recently because I became so fascinated with this guy and they're very easy to follow a and I put it like down in the dock, you know, like the bottom menu of my iphone. So I see it in the morning and it's super simple app and you just open it up and it's got a whole series of programs that you can do and I just the earbuds in and he just kind of talks you through it. So he takes the thinking out of it and it just makes it easy and I've been able just, just something about the ease of that. I guess I've been able to kind of just do it and create momentum around it and like anything else, once you have momentum and once you start to see the benefits of it, then you're more enthusiastic about pursuing it further.

Speaker 4:          02:43:31       Um, and it's been cool and this guy is, he's really, he's a cool dude. He a British dude and he was in college, dropped out of college. You, Andy Puddicombe, Pud d I c o m, b e a. He has a great ted talk by the way, but I grew up in London and dropped out of college and what's in Nepal and started studying buddhist meditation and became a Buddhist monk and he lived basically in relative seclusion for like 10 years as a Buddhist monk practicing meditation and that he had this kind of postmodern said a moment where he realized like, you know, I need to go back to the west. He had this calling to come back and be a teacher and he started this company, headspace, that's become huge. They've got like over a million subscribers on this app. He's developed this huge business around it and he's very accessible.

Speaker 4:          02:44:22       He's friendly and engaging and very modern and you know, he sort of like, where's live? He lives here in Venice now. He moved from London. He lives here in Venice. Schooldude. Yeah, there is his. And then he um, right before he wants, once he decided he wasn't going to be a monk anymore. And before he kind of returned west, he studied circus arts at the Moscow, like college of circus and then went to a concert. Yeah, like he became like a Spain, like, no, like the, like Cirque de Solei type stuff. So he's got like this crazy skillset and during his ted talk, he's like juggling the whole time. Really? He's, he's cool dude. What, what benefits have you found from this meditation? The biggest thing that I've found is that, um, I'm able to navigate stressful situations much more gracefully. I'm far less reactive, uh, to people I'm able to kind of calmly take information out, engage it, and then respond more mindfully and I'm able to, you know, I've got a lot of stuff going on right now is like, you know, it's just.

Speaker 4:          02:45:25       And to be able to kind of not get anxious over that and just be able to say, okay, you know, focus on one thing at a time and not get worked up about the smaller stuff. Um, and just ultimately a much more productive and constructive in my interactions with other people focused when I'm working present with my wife and my kids and calmer and it's impacted my sleep as well. It's been, it's been cool. I mean it's been, you know, I think the benefits, I've exceeded what I expected. I don't know how, you know, I didn't expect it to be any crazy difference, but it's been really great and it's sort of like, it's powerful too to be able to kind of stand in your space and not get rattled by things like that's a pretty potent sort of

Speaker 2:          02:46:10       skill to develop. Like just imagine yourself, you know, you're at work, your boss is coming at you, he accuses you of unfairly if something. And you know, what do you do? Your like your buttons are pushed. Like you're on autopilot, you react in a certain way. But to be able to like reprogram yourself and go, oh, I have a choice here, you know, my brain is saying this, but you know, I don't have to engage in that pattern. I can actually tell a different story and react in a different way. I think that's a, that's a pretty powerful life skill that's worth developing. Yeah, no doubt. No doubt.

Speaker 3:          02:46:47       That's very cool. I'm gonna. Look into that and I'm definitely going to download that APP and check out him. That's, that's fascinating stuff. It's good stuff. Do you ever fuck around with the sensory deprivation tank?

Speaker 2:          02:46:57       I've been wanting to do that for so long. I want to go to the float lab and Venice. I've got a friend who's got a tank. I know you're big into that. I know that. I would really dig it. You have a tank? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So you know, what are the. You probably talked about this a ton on your show already, but like what if you could like encapsulate the benefits of that

Speaker 3:          02:47:16       removes the mind from the body, the, the influence of the body and all the stimuli of the world arose. It evaporates. Rather it just it. It's the mine untethered from the body in a very weird way and the way I always describe it as if we were having this conversation, but right next door, so you have people screaming at the top of their lungs will be very distracting. We would want to go, let's go talk over here and that. That screaming is information. It's stimuli stimulus you. You're constantly getting it right now where we're sitting in, even though these are very comfortable or Ergonomic chairs from the Ergo depot, cut Pisco chairs. Very good for your posture. I used to fucking these. I used my package to kill me at the end of every show, but because of these chairs, it's really fantastic, but it's still. You're still in a chair.

Speaker 3:          02:48:05       You're ass is pushing against it. You feel the weight of your body. You're moving around. There's. There's a desk in front of you. We have visual cues. We're hearing things. We have earphones on. There's all stuff that's going on constantly that we look at it as the world, but it really what it is is data. It's data coming into your brain that your brain has to process and that data life itself is a distraction in that tank. There is no data there. You mean you have a very limited amount of sensation of the fact that you were in water that will eventually go away. If you stay still long enough, the water's the same temperatures, your skin, so you will get to a point where you don't feel it. There's a thousand pounds of salt in that water, so you'll. You'll float effortlessly and you're in total darkness and as long as there's no bang around the room, as long as you're in a good silent area, you will experience quiet in a way that is you never get.

Speaker 3:          02:49:01       You will experience physical quiet. You will be no input and the absence of that input, your brain becomes supercharged. It makes it so much easier for me to understand influences, objectives, all the things that I had been pushing to the back of my brain, avoiding come to light instantaneously highlighted, uh, all issues become highlighted. Any, any stumbling blocks, any, any things that you really need to address all come to the forefront and the way I describe it as the first 20 minutes or so seem like, like a seminar on my life, like my life is being explained to me. Like, here's, if I went to a guru that could explain to me in no uncertain terms, like someone who really knows every aspect of my life. Like if you could plug a USB drive into my head into some super computer that can fix things, they'd go, oh, well, look at all these issues you have. You have to get rid of this, clean out, this clutter, stopped doing that because you don't like it. Don't do this. Don't hang out with this person hanging out with that person more concentrated, more on this aspect of your life. Just creatively. It's an unbelievable tool. Uh, I go over a Jujitsu techniques in the tank. I go over transitions, I go over, stand up comedy in there. I go over everything in there.

Speaker 4:          02:50:19       Yeah, that's great. I want to check it out. I mean, it sounds the way that you described that is very similar to the experiences that I have when I'm in long distance running and training. Sure. It's, that, you know, it's different because your heart's beating and it's, it's kind of an active meditation version of that, but, you know, it's so powerful, you know, and the more that I learn about this world of mindfulness you, it's just, it's untapped reservoirs of potential personal potential. Exactly. And um, you know, again, it goes back to, you know, western culture priorities like this is not, you know, this is, you know, the float lab like your tank. That's not a mainstream idea. You know what I mean? It's becoming more so. But yeah, but I mean to look the typical American, right. You know what I mean? It's kind of a foreign idea, but this idea that you know, your thinking mind is, is, is distinct from your higher consciousness and to the extent that you have control and you can harness your thinking mind for your benefit and you're able to, you know, silence the idol, negative chatter, you know, most people like you said, you know, it's coffee, donuts, whatever.

Speaker 4:          02:51:26       Um, there is a looping, you know, in my mind loops as much as the next person and generally it's not very kind. Things that are looping self defeatist ideas, negative thoughts. Oh my God, I'm going to do Joe Rogan's podcast. What if the desk squad army gangs up on me? You know, what's going to happen? You know, like whatever it is. You know what I mean? Like at meditation allows you to understand that you don't have to engage in that. It gives you a toolbox to say, let me tell a different story. I don't have to entertain that story, that story that I've been listening to my entire life that's led me down a certain path in my life and helped sort of forge a certain

Speaker 5:          02:52:06       trajectory. What if I tell a new story

Speaker 5:          02:52:10       and let's put that story together and see where that leads like, could there be anything more powerful than that? Very few things. No. Acting on those positive thoughts. Write that. That's just as powerful if not more. That's it. Yeah. And and uninstalling those buttons, that car that causes you to react and create negative consequences for you. That's a good way to end this podcast. The rich roll. That was three hours of awesome.
