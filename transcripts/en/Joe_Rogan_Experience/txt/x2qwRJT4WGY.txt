Speaker 1:          00:00:03       Four, three, two, one, ladies and Gentlemen, Michael Shermer and heavens on earth. The scientific search for the afterlife, immortality and Utopia. Did you find anything? No, sorry. Nothing. Well, I found interesting journeys that people use to try to get there from both the religious perspective and the scientific perspective. Um, so I do deal with the monotheisms versions of the afterlife and heaven, you know, Judaism, Christianity and Islam. But the core of the book is the radical life extension is crayons, transhumanist, the Extropians, the mind up loaders, the people that take all the supplements and all of the whole range there. I find that incredibly interesting. They call it an afterlife or atheists. It is, right? Yeah. I mean when, when you think about some of the people that are really like over the top hope, did you go to that 20, 45 thing in New York a few years back?

Speaker 1:          00:00:58       There was a futurist convention with all these people that for whatever reason they have this arbitrary date of 20, 45 years. It's been getting pushed back. This is when the singularity come, he's going to cut, was 20 slash 30, then 20, 40 now 45. Um, Kurzweil Kurzweil big. He's like the Grand Poobah. He is no download it. And when he gets on stage now he's not Predator naturally dynamic like a preacher, but he starts talking about, you know, we're gonna get to live forever. You're going to have your mind uploaded. And people are just like, oh my God, we are the generation that's going to do it. This is the first time. And the mom, you know, I used to be religious in my youth and I thought, man, this is like being back in church again. She stopped being religious. Uh, I started in high school and stopped in graduate school, so it was much seven.

Speaker 1:          00:01:46       You started being religious in high school, so it wasn't something that your family introduced. My parents were pretty secular. They, they weren't antireligious at what? That wasn't a thing then, but this is 1971 when I was in high school and the, and the sort of nascent born again movement was starting and there was no religious affiliation. It was just like, it's me and Jesus, that's it. It's just you and the Lord. There's a lot of these, um, very charismatic hip, young preachers that are doing sort of a thing like that where they don't even have their own church to like rent time and the church and they have these meetings where it's not, it's just nondenominational and they just talk about God and yet they get a lot of people fired up. Yep. And you know, they, they, the place I went to this place called the barn in Locker Santa where I grew up in, you know, they played guitar and sang to a sex cult.

Speaker 1:          00:02:40       It was kind of only starts banging. I was hoping for something like that. But no, no, no. That, that, that is one of the problems with the utopia that 19th century utopian experiments, they always turned into this, you know, free sex for the leader. Well, it always seems like whenever there's a man that's in a position where people start worshiping, you know, and then they start hanging on his every word. He's like, start you gotta. Start fucking some of these people. Well, I do, I covered Jim Jones and uh, you know, the way I phrase it is that no one joins a cult. They join a group that they think is going to do good, save the world can help me improve my life, improve the lives of others. And there's pictures online. You can see if Jim Jones with Jerry Brown, governor Jerry Brown first round and you know, they were man in the soup kitchens.

Speaker 1:          00:03:24       He was very liberal, open to African Americans being part of the church in San Francisco. They're gays women. Uh, you know, it was a really cutting edge, pioneering thing at the time it seemed like, yeah, that, that's a cool thing. I'm going to join this group. Not that me, but you know, the people that did this in the fifties and sixties when he was coming up and then into the seventies and then, then, yeah, he started having sex and drugs and then the, you know, the feds started kind of poking around taxes and that's when they went to South America speaking, which I think this week is the spike special. It's now the paramount network on Waco. Waco, this isn't that right now. I think it's like a started Sunday. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's a six part series or something along those lines. See, that's an interesting. Uh, I'm, I'm absolutely convinced most of these guys believe what they say now. Maybe, maybe they're bullshitters at the start or they only partially believe, but they, they repeat the rhetoric. Their followers give them positive reinforcement. They come to believe it. And uh, you know, David Koresh, he was right down the barrel. He totally believed, willing to die for his beliefs and he also was having sex with everybody.

Speaker 1:          00:04:31       I mean, it's so common. It's almost cliche. And his ex girlfriend grew up in one of these sort of religious cults and it was the same deal. The head guy was having sex with all the women and you know, he would have sex with different people's wives and everybody had a lead them. Yeah. Say there was a fundamentalist Mormons. Um, what's his name that's in jail now? Jeff. Jeffrey. Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, Jeffrey, Jeff, Steve Jeffries. It is. I'm thinking of Jim Jefferies, my friend, the comedian. But anyway, yeah, that's, you know, that's how it gets corrupted. I don't know if you've ever read John. I'm John Crack hours book under the banner of Heaven. This is the guy that, that mountain climber that did a into thin air and, and uh, and the, um, the one about the Alaskan kid. Anyway, he wrote this book called under the banner of the kid who died.

Speaker 1:          00:05:18       Yes. When they made that movie about moving into the wild. Yeah. So he did into the wild into thin air. Krakauer's a great writer. So this book, he starts to investigate the murder of this, um, polygamous family in Utah, just as a journalist. He's going to do a story for the New Yorker or something. And then he realized it just takes them down the path of this incredible world of polygamy, which still goes on now legally it's not illegal, but they marry one and then the others are so called sister wives and they're just there and they live on these, in these border towns along the border between Colorado and Utah, like Colorado city. You know, I've been to some of these places. It's like a, it's like a twilight zone episode. You go into this town gas station, whatever. It's like, oh, it feels kind of weird here.

Speaker 1:          00:06:01       And uh, so krakauer discovered this whole world of, you know, going all the way back to the founding of the religion. And um, uh, what's the name Joseph Smith and you know, he gets this revelation from God that, uh, well basically he's banging the woman down the street, he's married. And so he gets this revelation from God and crack era has this scenario in the book where he, he tells his wife, now, honey, I've been talking to God and you're not going to believe this, but he says, I have to marry this, you know, so, and so down the street. And she's like, Oh yeah, well I have to start seeing other guys. No, no. God was very specific about this just for the guys. And uh, and how do I know you talked about. Well, my buddies, they were there. They heard it also. And this is the first page of the book of Mormon is an affidavit.

Speaker 1:          00:06:49       These are the people that heard the revelation that they all signed it and it's like, okay, so this is how it starts. When Joseph Smith started it all off in 18, 20, he was only 14. Yeah, so 14 year old is not a liar. I just learned that a lie. It's not even like that. They're bad people. When you're 14 years old, you are a developing entity. You know your frontal lobes are not fully formed. You don't really know what you're practicing sentences, you know what you're doing, trying to exert your influence, and this guy was just very creative. He was and he got chased out of Palmyra. New York is where he started and then he moved to Missouri when basically he was in trouble with the law and and other issues and then he got in trouble there and he was killed and it usually, this ends a cult when the leader dies.

Speaker 1:          00:07:35       Now there's a, there's a, there's a critical period if you get a new dynamic leader to take over. Like in the case of scientology, David miscavige took over after l Ron Hubbard passed over to the other side and he managed to keep it going. Same thing with Brigham Young. It was bringing young that turned this little cult into a a world religion and they just went further west to Utah to get away from federal authorities. Now, how much of a hit is scientology taking from that? Leah Remini? I don't. I've not seen any data like a memberships and they're all secret about that. Anyway. It's proprietary data, so who knows? I can't imagine they could survive. Well, they could survive because they have tons of money through real estate investments, but I can't imagine their numbers or could be doing anything but drinking. Yeah. Between the Lawrence Wright book than the Hbo Documentary Feature. The crispy and your dialogue with Aaliyah was incredible and cheese. Just to hero amongst secular. Is that fight against colts? That's really. That's really the best way to do it. Not top down laws against cults unless they're doing something, he'll obviously illegal, but just bottom up members speaking. I had David Miscavige has dad on as well. That was, that was sad. That was sad because I felt like I was talking to a guy who felt like he wasted his life and lost

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       his son. Right. And he brought his son into scientology. The whole thing was. That was really disturbing. Yep. Just A. It's just very strange that the United States government is allowing those people to be tax exempt. I mean, with all the evidence that's available, you just go and look at what they're proposing and what they believe and the fetus and the frozens entities, they're dropped into the volcano. All the crazy shell. The story about there, this is what really worried me about the irs. I mean, I've always thought, you know, I don't fear it hell or the devil, but I figured the irs, you know, I take. I'm pretty careful about that, but they're the only major organization I've ever seen that beat the irs and they did it through a thousands of lawsuits. I think they sued him like 3,500 times or something and every single member that they could get to do it to them as well.

Speaker 2:          00:09:47       They were getting all their members to suicide. They were suing. That was the story. Isn't that how it worked? Yeah. And eventually the irs has said, okay, if I get your tea, your tech. But I mean if they're letting the Mormons do it and why wouldn't they let the scientists do and I really don't think any religion. It's ridiculous. I agree. I mean in 2018 with what we know about reality, the fact that we let some old voodoo superstitious nonsense, right? Not have to pay taxes and exert extreme power politically, socially, economically. It's crazy. Well, so. And they like preachers get it. They could, they can live in a house tax free, then have to pay property tax on the home that they own, you know? So there's a lot of these side benefits also that you don't normally hear about. So gross. So the freedom from religion foundation and some of these other organizations. Acu trying to combat some of this, but, but legally, how do you distinguish that from say a nonprofit like doctors without borders or one of these other groups? That Clinton Foundation?

Speaker 2:          00:10:49       Yeah. There was some statistic recently and the Clinton Foundation, how much money and not in 2014. They actually donated to Cherry. Oh Christ. It was like six percent. Something like extremely low. The rest of it with payroll and. Yeah, mostly expenses. Private. They're scams. All these things are scams. Yeah. It's just, yeah, it might be good to just clean house and, and just. No one gets a nonprofit or tax free status. Yeah. Unless you're just. Well, I don't know. I mean I feel like there was room in the world for compassionate charities that are actual charities that are really legitimate. There's room in the world for them and I think that they should have tax exempt status, but I think we should be really stringent. Right. You know about what we accept. Yeah. Well the Supreme Court then they have a pr problem is where do you draw the line? Do you know? Because somebody says, well, I have a goofy belief that the Jane's have some weird beliefs or something, but you know, but, but they're man in the soup kitchens, they're helping the poor and there's no corruption. So what's the difference between them and the scientologists who say, Hey, you know, we have our own religious beliefs that to

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       use sound goofy, but you know, to us they're true. What's the difference?

Speaker 3:          00:11:57       Well, the Mormons are fascinating to me because they do seem goofy when you look at the idea that Joseph Smith, who was a 14 year old found golden tablets that contained a loss work of Jesus and only he could read them because he had a magic seer stone. And then when the, the local townspeople came to see, well, where are these stones? Oh, the angels came and took them away because we did not believe like it's so preposterous. But Mormons are really nice people. Totally Nice. They are the best cult. They're the sweetest, nicest place. I think they've made the transition from coal to religion to a religious sect. And most,

Speaker 1:          00:12:33       most Christians no longer consider them a cult. Some evangelicals do because they're pretty far out, but most mainstream Christian say, yeah, yeah, they're Christians. I mean, they accept Jesus as their savior and that technically that gets you in the club.

Speaker 3:          00:12:45       They start to let all that Joseph Smith stuff go. Yeah. Because they're the way they treat people's fantastic. I mean, yeah, I'm not a big fan of them going to these poor countries and proselytizing and you know, getting these vulnerable people to become part, but I think the way they deal with community and the way they deal with each other, it's like a very. It's a very warm and friendly and family environment and most of the Mormons that I've met that are practicing have been very nice people and they're serious about their tithing and the 10 percent. I mean they have strict rules about this like capital gains that it's equivalent capital. So if you sell your house and make a profit, you got to give 10 percent of that to church, not just your income, your paycheck, and they. They're pretty, pretty strict about that.

Speaker 3:          00:13:27       And the money, as far as I know, mostly goes for good causes that really does help poor people, things like that. So in your book, did you go over near death experiences? I have a chapter on that. What do you think is going on? Like when people like the ones that have fascinated me or people in the hospital bed that see their body from above and you're dealing with a bunch of chemicals that are released in the body, right? There's morphine and all sorts of different things, psychedelic chemicals and all the different things that are happening while your brain is, is basically on the edge of death,

Speaker 1:          00:14:03       right? So it's important to remember that they're near death experiences. You're not actually dead. So there's, there's a luminal transitional stage there where you're sliding into some other state of consciousness, altered state of consciousness. And we know that if you inject or you take hallucinogens, you know those are molech. Those are molecules that operate on a lock and key mechanism with the synapses in your brain and your neurons. So if they, these external drugs work in this molecular lock and key mechanism, there must be natural chemicals similar molecularly to that in the brain already just in smaller doses. So one theory about near death experiences is that a, is that this is a way of transitioning from living dead without feeling anxious and falling apart and upset and depressed or whatever. Just kind of a smooth feel good, you know, better than a morphine drip kind of way of making the transition.

Speaker 1:          00:14:57       And uh, but we know for example, that this, a scientist named Dr James wintery worked for the United States air force working with pilots, accelerating them in a centrifuge and they would black out this part of their training, you know, two g, three G, four g boom out you go at some point, like 10 g's. And most of them have these little dream. Let states that he called them, which are kind of like a. I saw a tunnel of white light at the end of the tunnel. I felt myself floating out of the seat and having these sort of weird experiences and we know exactly what that is. You know, the blood is being compressed to the center of the body, including the center of the brain. The last thing to go is your brainstem, of course, keep you alive. So the Cortex is shutting down from the outside in.

Speaker 1:          00:15:38       That would create this kind of tunneling effect on the back of your skull, where your visual Cortex is that create some of that, uh, open brain surgeries. These are on epileptic patients where they cut them open and they poke around to see where the seizures are starting. Um, and, and so they could, you know, zap those neurons instead of some big, crude a attack and anyway, so while they're doing that, they get permission from the patient to wake them up while they're under a and the brain is open and they tap around with electrodes. So this is one way to map the brain is doing. If so, what do you report when I tap here? Oh, I just had a vision of my 10th birthday or whatever. And it's like, okay, that's where that, that stored right there. Well, there's another spot right on the, um, the temporal lobes just above your ears where you can tap it and the person says, Oh, I'm floating out of my body.

Speaker 1:          00:16:25       I'm up by the ceiling now. And you tap it a little to the left on my left leg is up, my right leg is that night. My left arm is floating in. My right arm is floating way up here now. Now I'm coming back down just by, you know, with a Rheostat, just controlling how much electricity is going into the neurons in that one particular spot. So we know for sure that the near death experiences are in the brain and the experiences that the people report are real. They have experienced, um, but we know it's neurologically based. Now the counter argument is yes, of course you have to have your brain to have experiences, but it's kind of a like a doors of perception opening into this other realm that these chemicals allow you to do. It's like it was, by the way, I've been talking with Graham Hancock about Alaska.

Speaker 1:          00:17:09       He's invited me to come join him and Arrhythmia in Costa Rica to try this, you know, I've never tried this and I'm tempted to go do this to say, okay, let's, I'm going to write about these things. I should experience it. And, but there's a debate amongst people who do this, that you know, it. Is it strictly just in your head and you're not actually going anywhere or does it open some door to some other dimension? Okay. That's Kinda the. And um, and so the near death experience, believers counter that will, yes, it's in your brain, but it still is taking you somewhere else. The problem is, is that how you tell the difference between. I had a personal experience that the only way you can share it as if you actually go through it yourself for a scientific community that studies as well. There has to be some way to test it somehow or tell the difference between that.

Speaker 1:          00:17:57       So for example, the limitations of the scientific method does because we are dealing with consciousness and you're dealing with memories and dreams and ideas. Like you can't measure those either. That's right. So, uh, I quote go to other sources. Okay. So first of all, I discussed the most famous example is even Alexander's a trip to have and he wrote a book called proof of Heaven. Now this is a harvard trained neurologist. He knows more about the brain than I do and so he knows all the research I'm talking to you about and there's a lot more. So. But for him it was so powerful and okay, what's it like? So he talks about in his book he was in a coma, in a hospital. Okay. So he takes this trip and the colors were unbelievably intense and rich and I felt just deep personal love for the people I saw in oneness with the cosmos.

Speaker 1:          00:18:43       And it goes on and on about this. So then I quote from Oliver Sacks, his memoir when the talks about in the sixties when he was dropping acid and you know, the colors were incredibly intense and I had this incredible feeling of love and connected and I quote from Sam Harris's the opening pages of waking up. You know, I took ecstasy and I'm sitting there on the couch with my buddy and all of a sudden I feel this intense love for my friends. In other words, you know, the narratives are indistinguishable to an outsider. So how do you know that you're actually going to heaven or you're just having a fantastic trip? Well, it's entirely possible. It's both. Well, so how do we know? We don't know that. I think the real problem is people saying that they know. Right? Right. Saying that I know that I was in another dimension.

Speaker 1:          00:19:27       I mean, it's entirely possible that your consciousness is capable of going through these chemical doorways that are created by these molecules and that it experiences some frequency on the, on the dial. Like if there's a radio dial, maybe we're at 95 point five, but you can get to 97 if you take, you know, x amount of milligrams of diamonds, tryptamine and then you go to this new place. You know, this still physically here and Elvis Huxley's book the doors of perception. Yes. Which supposedly is where the door has got their name, but somebody told me that that's a meme. That's not true, but I don't know. Anyway, but that's the idea. Yeah, sounds good. So, but really what you're getting at is a super core problem of what is truth, how do you know that it was so mystical experiences are by definition personal and you can't corroborate them through some external scientific method.

Speaker 1:          00:20:23       So I mean science is based on the, on the, on the act that we can falsify a claim, we can test it somehow and that it's not just me pointing to something and say, I think that's true because I experienced that, you know. So I wrote a column in scientific American about this called. What is truth is I started off with a lie. The truth for me is that dark chocolate's better than milk chocolate. Then maybe you say no, milk chocolate's better than dark chocolate and then you know, there's no way we're going to resolve that because the truth is that that's just preference. That's just, that's an internal state or I say the other example I use is, you know, the stairway to heaven is the greatest rock song of all time. Then you go, no, no, freebird is better than stairway to. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:21:00       You can't resolve these things. Right. So you slide there from into things like these personal experiences we have. So you know, so what I think Graham is hoping if I go to rhythmia and try Iowaska and I say, wow, I report this fantastic experience I had was literally I'll have this and then it'll be, we'll did I Michael Shermer go to this other dimension and now I really kind of as a skeptic need to renounce my pure materialistic, monistic a belief in, in, in, in admit there's a dualistic. That's another side. There's the spirit side or something and I'm not at all sure I could do that because how would I get out of my own head and say, I know for sure that I went to this other place because I wouldn't know

Speaker 3:          00:21:39       you. Most certainly don't know you, you, you know that the experience was a real experience in terms of the fact that you had it like you, you felt the things. I haven't done Iowasca, but I've done the active ingredient and Iowasca many times it's dimethyltryptamine and it's more potent in the form that I've done in it. It's a shorter, lasting, much more potent experience and it's undeniably phenomenal. Really. It is very crazy. It's impossible to describe. I would throw some words around and do my best, but it won't work. Right. The trip itself, what's really bizarre, there's a lot of really bizarre aspects of it, but one of the things is really bizarre is the feeling that you've been there before him and the speculation and Terence Mckenna talked about this pretty in depth. One of the, one of the speculations is that when you're in rem sleep, you're experiencing some form of dime, Ethel tryptamine in that your brain, your liver, your.

Speaker 3:          00:22:38       They know for a fact that it's produced by your liver and your lungs, and now they know the used to be anecdotal evidence that was produced by the pineal gland, which is of course the third eye in reptiles and certain reptiles that actually has a retina. We didn't literally is in the center of your head where the eastern mysticism third it exists right now. They know that in rats because of the cottonwood research foundation, which is something that Dr Richard, Rick Strassman, who was the guy who wrote the book dmt the spirit molecule, right? He was the guy who got the first federally approved tests done on dimethyltryptamine clinic trials and uh, it's an amazing book, really, really fascinating. And he was a part of this cotton we'd Research Foundation and they've now proven that in live rats, the pineal gland produces dmt. Obviously that doesn't produce an in people, but it's, it's very hopeful to. Do you have other mammals.

Speaker 1:          00:23:31       Yeah. And again, if, if the molecular lock and key mechanism is set up in the brain already for this external drug to work, there must be something like that already. That's in the brain that evolved for some reason.

Speaker 3:          00:23:43       Are you aware of the correlation between this and Moses

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       is burning Bush? Oh, I've heard ideas about that. Yeah. Jerusalem scholars believed now that the burning Bush may very well have been the occasional Bush. Bush is a tree. It's rich and dimethyltryptamine so that this is. Well, it's sort. He's tripping, but I think we're getting. We have to realize when we're translating things from the Bible, when you're translating from ancient Hebrew, which is incredibly unusual language, where letters also double as numbers and like the letter a is also the number one and there's a numerical value to words and it's a very weird language to translate to Latin and Greek into English, so when we're hearing that Moses experienced a burning Bush and that this burning Bush was God and God gave him these commandments on how to live your life. It's entirely possible that Moses was tripping on dmt and that this burning Bush, that what we're getting is an interpretation of somehow they had a dmt experience from smoking this Bush, right?

Speaker 2:          00:24:49       Smoking some aspects of it. They figured out how to extract it or how to, you know, isolated and they had a dimethyltryptamine experience. I love that. Which pretty much makes sense. That totally makes sense. I mean we get, we get articles submitted all the time. It skeptic magazine of people that attempt to make natural explanations for biblical phenomena, you know, the Red Sea party because it was a giant earthquake or you know, the meteor strike cause the skies to turn red and that's what, you know, that the plagues of frogs, you know, that kind of thing. Okay. I like, although we published one in which the argument was that Jesus was never, he never died. He was in a deep coma on the cross and that one of his followers had stabbed, you know, when he got stabbed in the side with the wound that it actually had some chemical that put them in this coma and then they sort of a Dan Brown thing.

Speaker 2:          00:25:38       They whisked him off and put them in the cave and then, and then, and then stole him and he ended up in France or India or something like that. Okay. Maybe you know, I published it because I thought, yeah, there might be something to that. And, and I like those kinds of explanations. On the other hand, if you go into sorta your Joseph Campbell, Jordan Peterson role of thinking, well, maybe these stories or doing something else entirely, none of this stuff actually happened the way it's described. The stories are there to convey some moral homily or some message about how we should behave or act and that kind of thing. So I'm always conflicted about, you know, do I really want a natural explanation for this? Do we need to go that path? Or maybe the stories they didn't actually happened. Moses has never really existed or the people never lived in the desert for 40 years because there's no archeological evidence that this ever happened. Maybe it didn't happen. Maybe it's a story that represents, you know, destruction, redemption, starting over, something like that. Yeah, more likely. Right? Um, are you aware at all of, uh, any of the translations from the Dead Sea Scrolls? I haven't followed that too. There's a fascinating book to fascinating books that were written by a guy named

Speaker 3:          00:26:43       John Marco Allegro and John Mark Allegra was a scholar who was hired to be one of the people to decipher the Dead Sea Scrolls and he deciphered them for over 14 years and wrote a book called the sacred mushroom and the cross and his interpretation was that the entire Christian religion was a massive misunderstanding and what it really was that the original, the original religion was based on was the consumption of psychedelic mushrooms and fertility cults and all of these ancient parables were really just ways that they could retain the knowledge while hiding it from the Romans. So they did it in the store stories and parables, and he even traces back the word Christ to an ancient Sumeria word, which means a mushroom covered in God's semen. Yeah. This is what. It's crazy. It's crazy. Book has actually bought out by the Catholic Church and then reprinted recently by a guy named Irvin and he did it like a five or six years ago, maybe more.

Speaker 3:          00:27:50       He. He reprints so you can buy it now, but I have two copies of it that were original prints that I bought from a long time ago, but they bought it out and send it out to get rid of it. Yes, to get rid of it. And then John Marco Allegro wrote a second book called the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Christian myth, after they bought out his first book, right? So he has two books that are available that are basically supporting this theory, but the idea was that rain would come down and the people at the time, we have to consider the fact that infant mortality was incredibly high back then. People died all the time and fertility was very unknown. No one really understood why people got pregnant or how they got pregnant or what kept people from getting pregnant. And so people were constantly concerned with the possibility of them going extinct and they really were concerned with villages getting wiped out, their family getting wiped out.

Speaker 3:          00:28:38       So they were very concerned with fertility and they thought that when it rained, these mushrooms that came out of the ground, they came out of nowhere. Like you know how quick a mushroom grows. It's not like a plant. Right? So if there's a spore, which by the way, their spores everywhere, there's my sealyham that's underneath the earth and everywhere you go, there's the potential for the growth of these mushrooms. So the rain comes down and then almost instantaneously these mushrooms blossom up out of the ground, right? You eat these mushrooms, you have intense psychedelic experiences. You gather them up, you hide it from the Romans, you hide it from everybody. Don't want people to know that this is your portal to God. And so they had all these stories that they hit. Now I don't know if he's right and I'm not a religious scholar, nor am I an expert in ancient languages, but it's incredibly compelling.

Speaker 3:          00:29:26       It's really fascinating stuff. Interesting. Yeah. He was a legit rock solid scholar, right? You know, he was, by the way, he was also an ordained minister and the only one that was on the Dead Sea Scrolls deciphering group that was agnostic because through his study of religion, once he became an ordained minister and then became a scholar through a study of religion, he realized like, oh, these are all like ancient weird stories, and they're all incredibly similar and as you go back and time you find the similarities. And coon Bron is where they found the Dead Sea Scrolls is the oldest version of the Bible. The only one that's written in in, I think it's the only one that's written in Aramaic, right? They. They actually had to do DNA tests because the, the Qumran scrolls were written on animal skins, so they had to do dna tests on the skins left.

Speaker 3:          00:30:18       So the one they could match up the pieces to the right animal. Yeah. So they had a match up the pieces of the scroll when they were trying to piece it all together, like a gigantic jigsaw puzzle took them forever to do. Right. I do remember a controversy from a few years ago of the the Dead Sea Scrolls Committee, whoever controls them were not very forthcoming about what they were finding and letting go and letting outsiders look at the originals. Yeah, there's some wacky stuff in there apparently. Yeah. And also, you know, intellectual groups like that, they tend to circle the wagons were the elite special experts and you can't look at these things and I think there's that, but I think there's also like if you're gonna go by the way Christianity set up those stories are, this is what everything is based on as many Moses, Joseph, all these different characters that those stories are completely different.

Speaker 3:          00:31:12       Apparently in the Dead Sea Scrolls and there's a lot of wacky stuff. Yes. Right. Things coming from the sky, like alien type stuff, right. Weird Shit and right. People were probably tripping their balls off. You're probably. I mean that's what I think. It's entirely possible that the Zico story about the thing in this guy, and of course the ecologists think well that they were seeing a Ufo but other. No, no. They were tripping and I was much more likely that we know for fact that psychedelic mushrooms existed back then. It is the easiest thing in the world to see a mushroom pick it up and eat it. Right. So when people did it all the time, they experimented with food all the time. There were no books to look up to see which are the good ones to eat according to completely make sense. Completely makes sense. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:31:54       And there's also in a lot of really ancient religious art, there's tremendous mushroom iconic photographs of these paintings. Uh, there's a tremendous, tremendous amount of mushroom imagery, ancient Christian art. In fact, the actual halo, the halo used to be different. The Halo that we see now is like a hula hoop around guys heads, right? But the old Hailu used to look like the bottom of a mushroom cap. Oh really? Have you ever seen, you know, see if you can find those images. I wrote an article a long time ago called Santa Claus wasn't mushroom because Sam, the, the Amany to miscarry a mushroom, that this is all based on looks like Santa Claus. It's a white and red mushroom and a lot of people and it has a microrisal relationship with

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       the coniferous tree, so that's the. That's the mushroom. The ammunition was scary, but if you scroll down, Jamie, there's an image of see like there's all those elves. Look at the old. Look at the. Scroll up to that. Elves up those elves. Yeah, that was. It was all Christmas. Like ancient Christmas images were connected to that mushroom. Now scroll down to those images of the halo. A look at the old halo. The Halo looks like the bottom of a mushroom cap. It does kind of. So the idea was those aren't like markings or letters or numbers. It's hard to tell. Just lines. Yeah. There's a bunch of those though. There's a ton of those images of ancient religious figures with that circle behind them with all those lines that look exactly like the underside of a mushroom county, and the idea was that these enlightened people were under the influence of mushrooms.

Speaker 2:          00:33:31       That's why they had the halo on voice to designate like, oh, this is the guy who was on mushrooms. We've taught us all this stuff. I like that. I like that idea better than Ufo. We know it's a real thing running and nobody can look. If you think you're brave, go eat five dried grams of psilocybin mushrooms. Good luck. You can't tell me they don't work. They work on everybody. They don't. They don't work whether or not you believe or not believe they just work right? So there's an easy way to see if you just took them and you go, oh, I see why these people thought this. Right? Well, my favorite biblical scholar to read is Bart Erhman, dino barter mill. He Does A. Well, he started off as a, as a Bible scholar because he was a believer. He went to the Moody Bible College. He was going to be a preacher and evangelical in the whole thing.

Speaker 2:          00:34:18       And then he went to, I think it was Princeton theological and he found out how the book was really written. It's awakened. It was, you know, it's an edited volume with lots and lots of people coming in later and modifying this and, and, and debunking some previous Old Testament in a story or whatever. And then he ended up being an atheist or agnostic or something, whatever he is, he not believe. So this is sort of the atheist favorite biblical scholar because he doesn't come at it with a religious belief, but he, he's got a bunch of teaching company courses where he deconstruct how Jesus, how Jesus became the Messiah or God or whatever. And you know, the Old Testament, the new testament with these books mean and it's a bit like a, you know, again, Jordan Peterson, you know, I'm going to talk for two hours about genesis one one, how can you talk for so long?

Speaker 2:          00:35:03       Just a single chapter in a book, you know, and well there's, there's a lot of historical interpretation. So I do know art historians will look at those Halos or the thing in the sky that the Ufo, the UFO. No, no. Actually at that time that artists were putting those things in the sky for this other reason. Like, okay, I didn't know that, so it's good to have some historical background to the text or the. Again, I don't read Hebrew, Greek, Aramaic or Latin, and so I'm trusting the King James Bible, which I really shouldn't, so I rely on people like Bart who can read it in the oldest version we have and

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       know that word actually means this. Oh, okay. I would be. I mean if, if you could get into a time machine and go to any time in history and just see what it was like how people behaved. Yeah. I'd be real tempted to go to ancient Egypt, but I'd also really be tempted to go to around the time of Christ. I mean, I don't necessarily even know if Christ was a real human, but I would love to see what life was like back then. Bart Bart thinks he probably did exist and obviously not the Messiah, not the supernatural step, but that somebody like that or by that name. Yeshua was not that unusual name. Probably did a lot of the stuff he did. This is itinerant preacher and so on, so I'm on board with that. I'm not part of the group. The atheists say he never even existed, completely made up story.

Speaker 1:          00:36:21       I don't think so. Uh, and I actually, in the heavens and earth I conclude probably erroneously are in the minority position that when he said the kingdom is within or in more famous passage that I'm there, my disciples standing here now will not die before they see the son of man return and these kinds of things in the gospels. I think his message was, there is no place that you're going to, when you, after you died that heaven is here, this is it. We have to make the most of it. And it's, it's a message that you would give to people that are suppressed, oppressed by the Romans. So I call this the oppression redemption myth. You know, that, that it's a story of a, of like the native American ghost dance in 1890. You know, when they're like an oppressed people, they're about to be wiped out in a messiah.

Speaker 1:          00:37:10       Comes and says, you know, it's all going to be great. You know, we're going to change everything. The buffalo are coming back. If you wear this sweater, it'll be impervious to white man's bullets and it was a very Christ like a story. Uh, and, and when you start looking at it, you see, oh, this, this story that comes up a lot in history among oppressed peoples as a way of saying we got to circle the wagons and take care of our own against these oppressors and make a better life here. Yeah. It just makes sense that there'd be so many parallels and you think about history and how many people were in pr, oppressed and how often these narratives repeated themselves over and over again when people got into power and then invaded others. And yeah, it's brutal history. I was just, I'm just reading a Neil Ferguson's new book, the tower and the square.

Speaker 1:          00:37:55       It's about that, the tension throughout all of human history, civilization between hierarchical, top down power structures and horizontal network power structures and that they're always intention, but mostly throughout history. It's the top down power, whoever's. And so his is one chapter opens with that scene from the good, the bad and the ugly. When, um, when Eli Wallach and cleanness twitter facing off each other in the cemetery and uh, and cleanness which shoots the other guy that really the bad guy. And then Eli Wallach tries to shoot his gun and it's empty and so cleanness would walk over to him and he says, there are two kinds of men in this world. Those who have loaded revolvers. And those who dig your going to dig.

Speaker 1:          00:38:42       Ferguson uses this star to say basically that's the history of civilization. Somebody who's got the loaded gun and everyone else is going to dig. It's amazing that we made it this far. I mean we live in such. I mean I know that there's troubles today and I know we have issues in our, in our own society and forget about other parts of the world, which there's horrific things happening right now, but in comparison to just a few thousand years ago, you would not want to live back there. It'd be fun to go to visit. If you come back. I would want to go into a giant bulletproof hamster bubble, like one of those roller and just like maybe where they couldn't see you. I just want to be there. They can't see me. Just. I would love to observe and see what. Because we have all these like I'm watching this show Vikings, right?

Speaker 1:          00:39:26       And Oh man, it pissed me off. Episode two, this guy puts his feet up on the table and he's got rubber bottom soles of his shoe. My Cue motherfuckers. He has a heel that's clearly made in a factory and there's like this textured plastic bottom to his shoe. I'm like, how did no one catch this? You guys have this amazing wardrobe and all these ships and I'll take a picture of it now. I'll put it up on my instagram later was so dumb. It made me angry, but I'm watching this and I'm like, how do we know this was how they talked? How do we know this is what they did? How do we. This is some weird interpretation of some historical events really are to interpret and of course thoughts don't fossilize. So I started early in the book about, you know, who were the first people to figure out we're going to die and become aware of our own mortality in a way that, well, maybe I can conceive of being somewhere else.

Speaker 1:          00:40:19       I don't actually die. So we, we know, uh, you know, an elephant's grieve and mammals grieve and Cetaceans, dolphins, whales, and so on. And chimps, they, you know, they feel these mothers are just depressed and suicidal when they're infants die. But that's different from conceiving of like, well, I know I'm going to die because I see people around me that I could conceive of maybe some other place to go. So I start off with something of a paradox that if I asked you to imagine yourself dead, you can't do it because to imagine anything, you have to be alive. So it's not going to be like falling asleep and waking up the next morning because you have dreams or whatever. It's going to be more like general anesthesia where it's, you know, 10, nine, eight, boom, boom lights out and you. But you just never wake up.

Speaker 1:          00:41:04       So. And we, we talk about things like, well there's nothing after death but, but even the word no thing implies there's a thing or you know, you're going to this place, this another, there's nothing, no thing or nowhere. It implies that there is aware that you're not going to, but there's not even aware that you're not going to. And it's like, you know, with Lawrence Krauss and some of these cosmologists, you know, what was there before the big bang. So when you say, well imagine the universe, stars, planets or galaxies, no light, but there's not even any space or time. And at some point you just don't have the words, Stephen's say what it is we're trying to talk about. There's, there's nothing before the big bang. You can't even ask actually talk about it. Well don't they think now though, that it's in, it's entirely possible that the big bang is like a cycle.

Speaker 1:          00:41:52       Yeah. Well I think it's something like that I think spans and contracts infinitely forever that that's a preferable. Well again, we have to come up with some way to talk about it. So we also have this weird biological idea based on our own limitations that there's a birth and a death of everything, right? So actually have a chapter devoted to Deepak Chopra and the eastern wisdom traditions were kind of buddies now. And yeah, I went to his center down in Carlsbad and spend some time there and I think he's all right. He's a good guy. Yeah. Now he's totally a good guy. I mean, he, he's been. And at times in the past, either misleading or misled. Yes. Sometimes that's right. Um, you know, some of his recommendations for dietary things or whatever perhaps. But I know for sure because I've gotten to know him pretty well, that he totally believes this stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:42:42       He says, uh, it sounds like woo as I used to call it a, but a lot of it, if you interpret it from a kind of a Buddhist, western, Buddhist position know when he says, uh, you know, consciousness is the ground of all being. It's the ontological primitive. These things that sound nonsensical. But if you think about it sort of a, from a simple perspective, the entire universe is in your brain and when you cease to exist, the university says to exist for you, but you're in your brain. I call it the week consciousness principle. It's sort of true by definition. Now he goes a little bit further and says, you know, that consciousness is everything and that we bring into existence material stuff by thinking about her observing it or whatever. And here's some quantum physics experiments that are really spooky. And it's like, okay, time out.

Speaker 1:          00:43:31       You know, quantum physics is weird and spooky. Consciousness is weird and spooky. That doesn't mean they're connected. He thinks they are. So it's a debatable point. Okay. Uh, but still, um, the, the experience of going in and so I did the meditation thing and all the massages and the teas and the food and all that stuff. And it's, it's this beach side resort in Carl's bed. You can't help but feeling better. Like, yeah, this stuff works. Whereas Carlsbad, it's down by Encinitas. North of San Diego has a beautiful area. Totally beautiful. Yeah. He's Kinda deep box. Not done yet, he's got a good thing going and not just the bucket, you know, there's other people like Sam Harris at Bob Wright has a new book out called why Buddhism is true and okay, so it works. So we're back to does it work? What do you mean by does it work? Not just for me, I had an experience and I felt better. We've got to do better than that for science. So what Deepak and a brighter talking about is that is that the Western version of Buddhism may actually work medically. It may lower stress hormones in your body, but a lower

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       blood pressure. These kinds of things that are measurable because that's what we want to know from a western scientific perspective. Not just do I feel better, but 67 percent of the people who did this particular treatment, they got better by these measurable criteria. Okay. That's. That seems fair enough to me. I'm open to that now. This idea that there's nothing or no thing that we can't even. We can't even wrap our head around nothing because we would think of a thing that there's no thing, but there's never a thing. Right, right. But how do we or why? Why don't we just say we don't know. Why don't we speculate on the possibility of consciousness being some sort of ethereal thing or something that exists outside of the Bible? We don't know. We really don't. That's what I say. I, I conclude and you know, I don't know if there's an afterlife or not at very end of the book.

Speaker 2:          00:45:29       We can come back to this later. I just say it doesn't really matter whether there's an afterlife or not because we don't live in the afterlife. We live in this one, so this is the time you got to do whatever you gotta do. I call this elvis error a lob is lv singer. Woody Allen's character in Annie Hall. I remember the scene early in the movie where he has a flashback as a young boy and his. He's in the psychiatrist office with his mom and you know, what's the problem? He won't do his homework. You don't do your homework. Why don't you do your homework, Alvin? He says the universe is expanding and he says the universe is expanding, goes to the universe, is everything there is, and if it's expanding one day it's all gonna blow apart, so nothing really matters. I'm not going to do my homework, and his father yells at him, what is the universe?

Speaker 2:          00:46:07       Got To do this. We live in Brooklyn. Brooklyn is not expanding, so that's my sort of take home message. We don't live in the afterlife or before the universe or after the. None of that matters. I mean it's interesting to talk about, but we live in this life so this is what really counts. They're fascinating things to contemplate, but ultimately you really, for practicality sake, you really should be paying attention to life. Totally. I mean, this is what I tell deep buck all the time when he says he bought, you know Michael, this table is actually made of atoms that are mostly empty space and the quantum physicists, but according to Sean Carroll, that's not correct over there, right? Yeah. He explained that this idea of empty space. He's like, no, that's just a poor way of describing it. I would defer to him and let him describe it.

Speaker 2:          00:46:51       He also described the superpositions particles, subatomic particles being in super position where they're in a state of moving and not moving at the same time. He explained that in a way that completely fucked my head up too. I'm like, well, I thought I had figured out sort of. I thought, I know. I didn't think I had to figure it out, but I thought I had a definition that at least was like, okay, well it's this even though I don't understand, and he's like, no, it's not even that. Okay. So yeah, so I refer to be pleased if you're interested, go to this Sean Carroll podcast, as I understand it anyway, that it doesn't really matter because the atoms are jiggling in a way that this is solid. You could tell it solid and this is the level

Speaker 1:          00:47:29       we live at. So many drops on your head. You're, you're in trouble. That's right. Yeah. So again, we don't live in a quantum world. We live in a macro world where this kind of stuff does matter. Okay. So, um, you know, to, for Deepak the whole Western way of thinking scientifically, there's a beginning and an end time is a linear thing that we could measure and there's birth and death, all that is the wrong way to think about it. That the Buddhist way is that it's just all consciousness. And when you die, you returned to the conscious state you were before you were in before you were born. So, so the physical body is just an instantiation of this conscious thing, whatever this is. And, and, okay, I, you know, I don't know, uh, you know, I'd be surprised, but I'll be pleasantly surprised. I'll tell you that if it turns out, know close my eyes for the last time and I wake up and, you know, there's deep pockets, you know, whoever my friends, Carl Sagan and Stephen Jay Gould and all the greats, Asimov are there.

Speaker 1:          00:48:19       Everybody's there. Hitches there, you know, it's like, oh boy, okay, this isn't, this isn't hell. Uh, if that's true, you know, I'm not against any of this. Just like I'm not against Ray Kurzweil in these guys figuring out that we can live 200 years or 300 years. Great. If you can do it, you know, but let's just, you know, so when they say to me, Sherman, don't you want to live to be $500, it's like just get me to 80 without prostate cancer. Give me the 90 without Alzheimer's, you know, 100 to 100. So I'm not on a morphine drip in a bed, you know, just quality of life incrementally year by year. And if it turns out you solve these problems and we lived $150, $200, then we have a bunch of other problems we don't even know about yet. Okay. Well I think there's some beauty in temporary things that we, for whatever reason we're, we're avoiding that concept.

Speaker 1:          00:49:07       We were terrified of things ending and there's beauty and things being temporary, right? You don't want to go to see a movie that's 100 hours long. That's a movie's a great movement is 90 minutes you're in your app, maybe two hours. If it's three hours, if it's blade runner or something, something crazy like Christopher hitchens in my book is I love his analogy. First of all, you're at the party and death taps you on the shoulder says you have to leave and worse the party is going to go on without you and they're going to all have fun. It's like, oh no, but if the Christian version of of, of Heaven and Hell is real, you're tap on their shoulder at the party until you can never leave the party. It's like, oh, that's even worse. I don't want to. I don't want to do anything forever.

Speaker 1:          00:49:45       Right, and imagine the classical version of what heaven is like a guy with a harp and there's a bunch of babies with wings, like what are even that aside, this way? Hitch called it a celestial North Korea. You have a dictator that knows all of your thoughts and everything you're going to do. It's like, wait a minute that that does not sound like fun to me. That seems to me to be the inevitable future though. That's one of the things that I'm really nervous about the dystopian version of technological interference in our lives. I'm an entirely convinced that we're going to, in inside of 100 years, live in a world where all of your thoughts really are documented and there's

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       there's they have access to them the same way. No one in their wildest dreams conceived to photographs for hundred years ago. In 400 years from now, we're going to have the ability to record record thoughts and ideas and they're going to be able to read the contents of each other's minds. That could be well maybe that maybe we need some regulation there for that maybe or maybe we just have to accept the fact that most of what goes wrong in the world goes wrong because people can think the secret, sneaky, fucked up thoughts and when those no longer exist anymore, maybe it will clean out human behavior. There was an at our limits episode about that in the 19 fifties. It might've been the other one pilot tell twilight zone where this guy all of a sudden is able to read the minds of other people and he's at work and he's listening to all these conversations and you know, all this fun stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:51:21       But then this one guy who's really dark, like he's gonna, he's gonna come in and blow everybody away and sort of climax is where he, you know, he comes in and tells the boss and everybody in it and they, you know, they go in there and it turns out the guy says, well, I was never going to do that. I was just angry and I was just thinking that, you know, so that's like a minority report thing, you know, you could have these thoughts. We know from research that this is David buses research on. He wrote a book on murders, the murder next door it's called. And so he did the research on asking subjects. Have you ever thought about killing somebody you didn't like? It turns out like 80 percent of guys and 67 percent of women have had homicidal fantasies in their life.

Speaker 2:          00:52:01       Now 90 nine point nine percent of us never act on her homicidal fantasies, but we get mad at us if we can imagine and he's got the narrative accounts because he also asked him, tell me what you would do and Oh my God, they're just incredible to read. Like I would break every bone in his body and then I would pull out his fingernails and then I would just say they go onto your. You're like, Holy Shit, but it's just fantasy. Fantasy. Yeah. Some people have suicidal fantasies. It's people that have fantasies of jumping off of a giant building. Right. You what I mean, but most don't act on it. Most don't act on it and there's people that just have these thoughts and they think I'm. They look at the edge and they go, I could just jump off right now and and this whole thing, but I won't and shouldn't be punished them.

Speaker 2:          00:52:43       No, of course not. The minority report scenario, it's like, okay, we found out that this guy's thinking about robbing the bank, so he had a fantasy about it. He's going to do it. I've thought about doing that. You have, not really, but just really fleet and I was like, what would I do if I had to rob this bank? I mean, I've never actually considered robbing a bank, but I thought, okay, I'm at the bank. What am I just decided to pull out a gun and everybody gets the floor. Where's the, where's the cameras? Where's the security guard? You know, like you've seen so many movies. It's a if you're bored, you know, but today that's another thing. People are rarely board because when they are, they just pull out their phones, stare at pictures of their butts. It's like, you know, you just pull out facebook or instagram. No longer board.

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       When I was in my religious phase and in, uh, in college I asked, that was before I went to pepperdine, which is a religious clothes at Glendale College, just to get my g out of the way. And my philosophy professor was an atheist and I was an evangelical. So I'm telling them about Jesus and the whole thing and the after life. And he said he want to know are there golf courses and tennis courts in heaven? Because I gotta have something to do, I'd be bored. I thought I have no idea and need. Yeah, I know, but it'd be with cheese. I want to play golf.

Speaker 1:          00:53:58       Then I also quote from Julia Sweeney is letting go of God monologue that she opens this monologue, you know, dealing with the Mormon boys coming by or her house in, in Hollywood, and they're pitching their story like, okay, come on in and pitch me your story. Like it's a Hollywood movie script. You know, what do you got? So they tell her the whole time it's going to be great. You know, the blind shall see again that Jeff Shell here again, and your body will be whole again. And so she says, well, let's see. Um, I had uterine cancer. So I had my uterus taken out. Do I get my uterus back when I go to heaven? They said, yeah. She goes, I don't want it back. What if you had a nose job and you liked it? They'll have to get my old nose back. It's true.

Speaker 1:          00:54:38       I'd say openness. A little funny story because it gets to the problem of identity. Who are you? So if you're resurrected with Jesus, he early earlier Christian sex before descartes introduced dualism. They believe that you are, when you're resurrected at the, you know, after your death, you are physically there in heaven physically and your soul. The whole thing. It's just one thing. So the question is, well, how old are you when you're there? You know, so you're brought up and there you are sitting next to Jesus and God and whatever, you know. So they. Okay, 30, 30 seems like a good year. It's a year. Jesus was crucified. Okay. Thirty. Like, but wait a minute and I'm 63 now. So what happens is all the memories of my life for the last 33 years. Oh No, you get all those memories. Okay? But the memory, the memory of my being 30 now is different from the memory I had when I was 50 of being 30 and 40 being 30.

Speaker 1:          00:55:31       And even when I was in my thirties being 30, you know, the, the memories are always changing and edited in, in, in, um, and forgotten or modified if it, particularly based on life experiences that happened afterwards. So in your twenties, you go to this college, he marry this person and you take this job or whatever, you don't really know what the Info, the impact of those decisions are until much later in life, which is why we think it's ridiculous for people to write memoirs in their twenties or thirties because they're celebrities. You have no idea what those things actually mean until much later. So this is the problem of who you are. So first of all, we, we already know that none of your body is the same material. It was, say a decade ago. Your cells are all recycled. The molecules and atoms are gone. There's new ones that replace it.

Speaker 1:          00:56:16       It's the pattern. It's the pattern of information that represents you, Joe Rogan. This is what you look like. These are your memories. So somehow that this has to be copied. So in the Ray Kurzweil scenario of the singularity, we're going to upload the mind. They're going to copy your connectome, all your memories in your synapses. Okay? So right away there's the problem of, well, which memories will all of them? No, there are no fixed set of memories that are you. Your memories are always changing. So the moment you take a snapshot of it, that's just a fixed point. That's not you really. You are this whole long continuum. Uh, that's always kind of flexible and changing. So there's that. And then there's the problem with the mind uploading scenario is there's two kinds of cells. There's the memory cells meme self of all your memories, and then there's the point of view, self pov self.

Speaker 1:          00:57:04       So when you go to sleep tonight, you wake up tomorrow, you're still looking at the world through your eyes, and there's a continuity of point of view from one day to the next. Same thing with general anesthesia. So like in the Johnny Depp movie, Transcendence, where he is poisoned by these terrorists and he's dying, he's got to, like a week ago, he copies his mind connect. Um, quilvent of the genome and puts it into a computer and then he dies and they turned the computer on and he's in the computer looking out through the little camera hole. I don't see how this could happen. That is if we copied you, your connectome, everything, all your memories. So we had a Joe Rogan number two copy ready to go, but instead of you dying, let's say we had a sophisticated. If Mri brain scan machine slid you into it, copied your connectome, uploaded it into the cloud or whatever, and then we slide you back out and you're standing there, you, you're still looking at the world through your eyes.

Speaker 1:          00:57:53       That's just Joe Rogan. Number two, a copy and no more. Do you look at that than a twin looks at it. Sibling and says, well, there I am. No, no, you're still standing. They go, no, no, I'm here. That's just a copy of me. And so this to me seems a a central problem with the mindup loading scenario. It's just a copy. Did you see the thing in national geographic today about the clone monkeys? No, they've, they've managed to actually clone monkeys. No. Yeah, so Jamie, I uh, I tweeted it earlier today. It's crazy and were speculating that if they can do that two monkeys, they're going to be able to be able to do that to humans. But again, so who is right? Who is that? If there's a Michael Shermer. Is it your twin? I mean like when you meet twins, they, it's very weird.

Speaker 1:          00:58:37       Like I used to date a girl who was a twin. She had a sister looked exactly like her, but like a little, just a something just to feel like you're not super, super confusing. So they weren't the same person but they pretty much were. Yeah. Here's the, here's the article, scroll up there, clone monkeys created in the lab. Now what? Yeah. Okay, well, so you're making copies so it's a copy, but it's not the same person because they had their own individual life experiences. The moment you and your copy start diverging away and lead leading different lives, you're gonna have different memories you should have on your show. Nancy Siegel from cal state fullerton. She's the world's leading twin expert. And she has all these great scenarios. She a new book out called accidental brothers and she has another book out on switched at birth and Nancy Siegel and, and, and these are scenarios that not only do we have the behavior genetics studies because she worked on the famous Minnesota twins research, not the baseball team at the twins research of twins separated at birth and raised in different environments.

Speaker 1:          00:59:41       Like, you know, the one raised in a Jewish home, the other raised the Nazi Germany. They get together, they have the same watch, they wear the same kind of clothes, they use the same toothpaste. They married women that look pretty, pretty similar, you know. So there's a lot that genetics does that. It's very subtle. There's no gene for like, we're both Catholic or wearing this kind of close. But you know, if you have. Nancy explains that if you have a certain body type, which twins are going to have almost the exact same body type. Certain clothes are going to look better on you and you're more likely to pick those. So by chance are more likely to get similarly. There's no genes for clothes, but something like that body type or temperament, you know, you have a certain kind of temperament, at least half of which is, is heritable.

Speaker 1:          01:00:22       So you're more likely to choose certain professions or prefer certain hobbies or activities or pick spouses that are kind of, you know, that would gel well with that temperament. So this, if you make good decisions though, well yeah, there is that. There's an element of volition. The choices you make in life do diverge a little bit. So they're twins are a little bit different from that, but yeah. Um, but so a clone, you know, again, the moment you start leading separate lives, so why the copy of you is not going to be you in heaven in religions have the same problem and you know, if God is able to reconstruct your body like, like a transporter. I got into the world of Star Trek when I was writing this book. It's like, oh my God, they have this whole webpages devoted to what does the transport do?

Speaker 1:          01:01:05       It's like, okay, first of all, you know, there's no transport it, right? This is just science fiction, it could be whatever it wants, but is it copy and paste, they just copy you and reconstruct you on. So with Adams on the other side or is it cut and paste or is it the. They actually moved the atoms and reconstruct it anyway, but it does get to the problem of identity. Well, what are you really because you don't have to. It's not the matter the material. It's really the pattern which is why the singularity people focus on the cloud and uploading the mind because the information but the information is always changing and how does the point of view go with it? See what the cryonics. I can at least imagine that if I'm frozen and woken up somehow a thousand years from now that I'd wake up like like do after surgery or sleep.

Speaker 1:          01:01:50       I can't see how that would happen. If you flip on the switch and the computer or in the cloud or whatever, that I'd be there going, Oh, here I am. Well, isn't there also the problem that every. What is it, seven to 10 years? Every cell in your body essentially replaced except your neurons. There's that. That's right. Yeah. So are we just are neurons would. That's the idea that that's what the singularity or not your nose job. That's fake, but fake lips. That's your neurons only. But even there, see the transhumanists they imagined this transitional stage where you start wearing contact lenses. Say they can call up the Internet. And the moment I see you Joe Rogan, the name pops up, your wikipedia page pops up. And I know now I have this information so I'm not bionic. But uh, but I'm also not just human transhuman.

Speaker 1:          01:02:35       Okay. So then, then who are you? Right? So these are the sort of the transitional stage. So a cochlear implant. Is it kind of a brain chip and you know, probably, I think you know about that research of the paraplegic quadriplegic man who can control his computer a cursor and now they can actually control a fake artificial limb just by thinking about it. So they put a chip in his motor cortex that reads the thoughts. So he has these thoughts and he's been trained to pull the cup of water up to his mouth and drink with the artificial arm at some point, you know, say 50 years, a hundred years from now, we should, we could have it all mapped and you can control your whole environment just by thinking, you know, I would like to hear Mozart and you just think about it and then the music in your house comes on and it's Mozart.

Speaker 3:          01:03:19       Well, I, I freak out about Siri sometimes, like, um, my daughter asked me about a song that she likes and we were in the car and I pressed the Siri Button on my phone and I said, hey, it's some, what's that new musical with the, what's his name? Hugh Jackman Wolverine Guy. Some some musical that's based on ringling brothers and Barnum and Bailey circus. She wanted the song. I, I, I literally asked Siri to do it. And it started playing it instantly, like within a couple of seconds. Like this is crazy that this thing just pulled it out of the sky and it's playing it in my car.

Speaker 1:          01:03:58       Yep. I did that the other night. I wanted to hear Bob segers Hollywood nights. I'm not sure why I got that in my head and it popped right up. There's a youtube video of him from 1978. Just rocking it. It's like, wow. It's amazing that I'm just driving on the freeway. Heading back home to Santa Barbara. I'd like to hear Bob Seger.

Speaker 3:          01:04:15       Hollywood nights. Wow. There it is. The greatest showman. That's okay. My daughter loves that movie, so she wanted to hear the song, but I just talked to the phone and it did that. When are we going to get past that? Talking to the phone instead of thinking. Yeah, because I'm pretty comfortable with looking for it. Let me. Hold on, honey, let me find it online. I'm going to go get it. Okay. Let me download it. Let me pay for it. Let me use my thumbprint or whatever, and then now it's just talk to your phone right when. When is it? Just pull it up. I want to hear led Zeppelin. Whole Lotta love. I'll just. I'll just start thinking that starts playing and when is that going to happen? That's probably coming. We're, we're probably all going to give in to some sort of a chip. Something that we can get implanted. Simple, easy trans dermal device, you know, fashionable. You'd go to a club, it glows who you got the new one, iphone 38.

Speaker 1:          01:05:11       Yeah. I think all that's far more likely to happen before we get to the point where you could copy and entire brain in and put

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       it in a clone of your body. I interviewed Kurzweil and uh, I had a really interesting conversation with him for the Scifi show that was doing a few years back and uh, I find him to be very interesting. He's a fascinating, incredibly intelligent guy that has, I think he has more than a hundred different patents and things things invented. He's a genius. He's a bonafide genius, but I also found it incredibly, a sad his motivation, like what he's trying to do, you know, he's trying to recreate his father. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Because they didn't see that, uh, the documentary better. Yes. Yeah. Transcended, it was kind of sad. It's dark, it's very dark and he's got all his basement is filled with all his dad's stuff and um, you know, he always talking about life, life, life, but he just really kind of obsessed with death.

Speaker 2:          01:06:08       This is what I worry about is that again, back to the Elvis era, you know, we don't live in, in the next life, whatever that is or the far future we live now and don't miss it if you're so focused on death and, and how we can solve these problems. Okay. I'm glad somebody working on it and he's head of engineering for all of Google now and they had that company, Calico, so a couple of hundred million dollars working on aging problems. Great. Again, if you could solve Alzheimer's, those things, that's great, but you know, don't be so focused on the next life you miss out. Well, I don't necessarily know if he is so focused that he's missing out. I don't think he's missing out on. I think he has extraordinary vision in terms of like what is possible with the exponential increase of technology. So I think having a guy like that around, it's helpful.

Speaker 2:          01:06:54       It's. I think it's beneficial to everybody. It's incredibly fascinating to hear him talk about those things. You know? I'm too dumb to know if he's right. What I'm hearing him talk, I'm like, you think really? Thank you. Yes. By 20, 45 will be downloading our brain into a computer. Mind man, I don't know. That shit seems close. Yeah, it's 2018 man. I mean when I interviewed him, I think it was probably 2013 or somewhere around then. Although to be fair, if you said, you know, a century ago when they had telegraphed, well more than a century ago, the invention of the Telegraph, but you know, in a century and a half or so you're going to be pressing a button and just calling out what you want on a little box. It'd be like urine saying this, what are you talking about? Smoking? And here we are, you know, so this way science fiction is usually set far enough in advance like a century or two rather than in the historical present.

Speaker 2:          01:07:46       So that you can populate these kinds of things. This is what science fiction writers tell me. If you set it up far enough, uh, uh, readers are willing to suspend disbelief because. Yeah, it seems possible. Look what we've been able to do. So. Okay, fair enough. If we can do that, um, I'm all for it. That'd be great. Yeah. I'm all for it too. But boy, I don't know. I'm, I'm, I've been very convinced and more so over time that human beings in this form that our time is limited. I think. Yes, when artificial. And I think even the word artificial life is a weird word to throw around because it's not going to be artificial. It's going to be an actual thing, right? It's just going to be non biological. Right. And I think it's, I think that's what life is outside of earth.

Speaker 2:          01:08:32       I think that humans, what we do with our curiosity, if there's other curiosity in, in the universe, other curious life forms, I think they probably do the same thing. They realized, well, there's a massive limitation in terms of biological tissue and in terms of our ability to evolve like, well, I could just reprogram a phone. Your phone involves way quicker than people. They go back to the goodyear. I have an iphone x right now. Go back and think about an iphone one. That's a piece of shit that you have to go back to a decade, a decade. Then it go back to that clinic. Seti scientists or scientists tend to be skeptical of the UFO alien abduction stories because if we do encounter aliens coming here, they're not going to be biological. Yeah, they're going to be computers or machines because that's the only thing they can survive the long distances.

Speaker 2:          01:09:24       Long time of interstellar space flight. Yeah. I think we're just so wrapped up in the idea of biology being so important that you have to. It has to breed the normal way with eggs and sperm or otherwise. It's bullshit. I mean we think of it, you know, but biology is, you know, wet stuff, but really their machines, a cell is a machine. It's just processing molecules, which is what nanobots are going to do. They're going to process molecule. So it's really just. They're all machines. Yeah. There's cellular machines and, and you know when they talk about things like quantum computing and things get really squirrely, like, Whoa, Whoa, wait a minute, what are you saying? Well, what do you mean by quantum computing? Right? Like where is this? Is this a computer? Like does this use like a regular motherboard? Like how does it have a CPU?

Speaker 2:          01:10:12       Like uh, what, what's, what's next stage after that? Like what do you know? What, what resemblance is it going to have to. Anything that we think of today in terms of technology that we're accustomed to. Right. You know, so it really makes the point that, you know, if he try track, say back to the 19 fifties where you have computers the size of this room down to now. Okay. So you just keep the curve going and eventually there'll be the size of blood cells and you just ingest these little computers and then go in there and they fix your mutant dna in the bacteria that are in there. They repair blood vessels, that sort of thing. This is what he's envisioning and I can conceive of it in principle, I think, but they're, I forget whose law is in any, any trend that cannot go on forever, won't.

Speaker 2:          01:10:59       So. Right. So if it gets to a certain, like the, like Moore's law, the doubling of that can't go on forever. Now the quantum computing people say, Oh yes, that's right. It'll stop, but we're going to do this other thing that is completely okay. Okay, fine. Well boy, I just, I mean there's so many things to speculate about in terms of our potential future, you know, and the, the, the, the fear of death is a very odd one. It's normal, it's natural, it's biological. Animals have it. Every human has it. Everyone's scared to die. No one's scared to go to sleep, but everyone's scared to die. And it's this idea that this would be the end of the party, right? But really there's nothing to fear because you won't even know it. Right? He is. As long as you're alive, you're Santi and conscious of existence.

Speaker 2:          01:11:52       And then not. So. I mean, when you ask people to quote surveys in the book, you know, how long would you like to live it? It's always about what the average lifespan is. Now. People go, Oh yeah, I think I'd like to live in [inaudible] 82 or so. But if we fast forward you to 80. Okay, your time's up. Tomorrow's your day. No way to get. Give me another week. Okay, here's everybody I need another month. A year to run my first marathon. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. I contend that it's a silly argument that you know, that people say, well, I think we should have a limit on our, our lifespan and that we need to die, you know, but, but, but you personally, are you going to check out when it's your time? No, of course they would. As long as we're talking about being healthy and in, in, in cognitively aware, then most people want to continue.

Speaker 2:          01:12:39       Let me severely depressed suicide. Yes, that's an issue, but most people would want to continue on. So that's a point in favor of the transhumanists that yeah, people will want to keep going on as long as they're healthy and happy and leading fulfilled lives. Yeah. As long as everything's healthy. My grandmother had a stroke and they gave her 72 hours. She wound up living 12 years. Oh Wow. And it was, it was awful. She had, she had an aneurysm. Oh, the 12 years was awful. It was awful. It was horrific. Yeah, it was really bad. She was bedridden. She would moan. She was always in pain. When she died, it was a relief for everyone in the family. It wasn't like, oh, we lost. Grandma was like grandma's mps now because for the longest time she was in agony. It was. I stayed with them when I first moved to New York.

Speaker 2:          01:13:33       They lived in New Jersey and I live with them for a few months while I was saving up money for an apartment and um, it was a horrific man. She would be moaning and grandfather had to take care of her and they had a nurse would come over and take care of her as well. It was just a, I think Europeans have a more advanced humanist type perspective on that euthanasia or physician assisted suicide. Well, they're doing that now and a few states, but there's still this kind of sort of Christian ethic of only God can decide that you can't make those decisions. And these are people more like Christian conservatives who otherwise think the government should stay out of your life and you make your own and you

Speaker 1:          01:14:11       take personal responsibility except when it comes to your death. Like, well, wait a minute, why can't I choose that? While they worry about abuse? Okay, fine. Just have rules about, you know, you have to sign something and we have to. Video Kevorkian used to video tape, you know, his patients saying, I, I choose to do this when they could still do it anyway. So yeah, I mean, um, how we deal with death. It's always been a huge problem. It makes people uncomfortable. Um, and uh, you know, how we talk about it matters and I mean, one of the motives for me writing this book is like I've written about science and pseudoscience. Science and religion. Science and guts signed some morality, but, you know, really this is the big question. You know, what happens when you die and this something that you know, that people think about a lot or they thought about a lot for a long time and uh, you know, so, and nobody knows.

Speaker 1:          01:14:59       I contend, you know, nobody knows for sure. And uh, so we write these stories that kind of make us feel better because the whole theory called terror management theory that is premised on the idea that fear of death is what drives civilization and creativity and productivity and architects and artists and scientists are driven by this fear of death. But if you ask people, do you walk around in a state of fear of death? Most? No, I don't to it. Okay. It's unconscious. Okay. Maybe. But how do you know if it's unconscious? So we have to hit these experiments with a prime. The brain sort of try to trick it out of you and almost aren't they? Most people are busy. They're busy. Yeah. The fear of death comes when you're living alone at night. Right? What is it going to be a day when I don't wake up?

Speaker 1:          01:15:41       Right. It's gonna. Maybe he'll die tonight while I'm sleeping, but you'd never know. You just, you just, it's just lights out and that's, that's the greatest way to die. Ever go to sleep and don't wake up. That's right. Yup. Guy In your bed peacefully. Yup. Yup. That's a good way to go. Which is why, you know, hospice is probably, you know, a really good thing that we're getting better at it in the west of just helping people make that transition, which is why back to near death experiences. It could be those brain chemistry, the brain chemicals. That's what they evolved for was to help that process. As your brain is shutting down, you feel this sort of glow or this sort of good feeling that you know there's a tunnel you're going to pass through the sense of transitioning to some other place, and this starts off very early in life I.

Speaker 1:          01:16:23       I cite research by Paul Bloom and his lab at Yale with little kids, so he presents them with this little puppet show and so you have this little mouse and this alligator and the alligator munches the mouse and he's dead. Where's the mouse now? Oh, the mouse at this. Other than this other place and he misses his mom and he's hungry and he's scared. So and this is like preschoolers. So it starts pretty young that this dualistic idea that something transcends the physical body. There's something else that continues and I contend that that's because you can't conceive of nothing that just don't perceive my own brain operating. So it feels like thoughts are floating around up there and I feel like a kind of a set of patterns that would continue beyond the physical body feels that way. So our intuitions I think naturally lead to the idea of some kind of afterlife

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       or something continues. It is possible or is it possible that all these different cultures and all these different people have these concepts because maybe something does happen. Maybe some that's right. Yeah. It could be something that could possibly happen to whatever we think of as consciousness. That's sort of what we think of as you and I think most of our consciousness is weighed down by life experiences and genetics and our environment and all the things that we carry around in our head is memories. And I mean this is a big part of what, what your life is, you know, and at the core of all that is the self is you are consciousness, whatever that means, right? It's never been. No one's ever been able to take consciousness and a little, we extracted it and we put in this beaker and now we weighed it.

Speaker 2:          01:18:01       Consciousness is a 28 grams or whatever. Remember that stupid thing that people always think when you died, right? Yeah. Twenty, 21 grams yet 21 grams. But what? Imagine if that was the case and before that all happened, you went and downloaded, your brain does some super computer, right, so you got to use. You got one that lives in hell on earth, living forever, never going to die. Just one mundane trip to starbucks after another and you just try it out. You're trapped in a computer, which is what Ray Kurzweil is saying. Like what if like you would if they give you the opportunity to be trapped into computer, but you're trapped in an iphone one essentially once you're in, you're in like you can either wait and hang on for a few years and you will get a really good computer. We're thinking quantum computers are going to go live around 20, 30, 20, 32, but we can get you in now looking pretty.

Speaker 2:          01:18:59       You're coughing a lot, Mike. I mean, well it's like with the cryonics people and I remind people, you know, you're being frozen on the worst day of your life. You know the, they, you died and you can't do it earlier because the state treats it as a form of burial legally. So you can't be, you can't get the treatment and the fruit in the injected with the antifreeze and all that before you were actually dead or how they inject you with antifreeze yet type of antifreeze that, the purpose of that while your dad. So it doesn't really matter, but the purpose is to keep the cells from shattering the freezing process. We'll do that. So they've gotten much better about that. And what's actually frozen is this sort of gelatinous mass that's, that's vitrified. It's called vitrification process. So it's, it's, it's a little bit like a member of the touring the bodies where they had the dissected bodies and they were sort of this hard plastic plasticine.

Speaker 2:          01:19:49       The plasticine. Yeah. So this vitrification is sorta like that. And then that's frozen. And uh, as far as we need, as far as I'm concerned, everyone frozen to date, including Ted Williams in his head in Arizona, there will never be brought back. Isn't Walt Disney frozen? I trust that. Then it turns out they alcor cryonics foundation opened its doors and released a press release the same day Walt Disney died. And these two stories that. Yeah, yeah, that makes sense to Williams. One is sad because they didn't have the money for the whole body's took his head. All right, fuck. It actually isn't that expensive because if you. The way the way alcor and the other orgs do it is you take out an insurance policy on your life and you make them the beneficiary of the insurance policy. So if you started young, you had say a quarter million dollar insurance policy, a few hundred dollars a year in premiums.

Speaker 2:          01:20:47       He started super late. The premiums would be much higher, but it's not like you're shelling out a quarter million dollars right at your checkbook and then when you do die, what happens if you get defrosted? Because that has happened, right? Having done well. Oh well what happens is as you look like a bowl of melted strawberries that were frozen, it's just, it's just much that happened to one of the companies that does this. They had a power outage, right? Yeah. You don't want that. Yeah. I'm not sure whether in Alcor is in Arizona. I made. That's a terrible place. Shouldn't they be like in Antarctica and there's other deeper issues with this whole idea because if you're going to be frozen for a thousand years or so, what's to say that the state of Arizona is going to be around where the government or the company that keeps the lights on?

Speaker 2:          01:21:33       Everything under water or anything. Could anything transport your body and some sort of one of the big Ole Electric Tesla trucks. Big Cooler. It'll send you to Mars. Yeah, send me some new spot. Yeah. Cool. Uh, and again, um, would, if they somehow jumpstarted the body, would you wake up like you just had a long sleep? Would you still be in there? I'm not at all sure that you wouldn't just be something like if they, if the memories weren't preserved very well, then it would just be a Zombie. If you don't know who you are, there's no point in doing it. I think the idea is freeze you. And then one day they'll have the technology to throw you out and everything's going to be amazing. And there'll be able to reverse aging and bring you back to when you're 18. That's right, yeah, but here's the thing about memories, what like if you do die and say if you do go to heaven, you have the memories of your life.

Speaker 2:          01:22:31       Are Those memories just like the memories of today fallible and squirreling. Right, and if they're not, then that's not really you. And if God resurrects you physically, what's to stop you from aging and getting Alzheimer's or whatever. Well, God's gonna prevent that by reengineering you. Well then that's not really me. That's up there at some super human transhuman. I had a conversation with some friends of mine who are Mormon and they couldn't believe that I don't have religious feelings and one of the things that this lady said to me, I'll never forget, she goes, you don't believe in afterlife. How do you get up in the morning? Literally what she said, how do you get up? And I go, I love life here. I enjoy this experience. I am enjoying being here at dinner with you guys. I'm going to do some stuff tomorrow. I've got planned out looking forward to it.

Speaker 2:          01:23:21       I got like, don't you enjoy your time? Like does everything have to be for a reward some place that you're not even totally sure exist after we're done here? It's such a weird thing to say because I don't think they even think about that and I'd get seriously doubt. She wakes up in the morning goes, okay, because there's an afterlife. I'm feeling good about life and I'm going to get up. I doubt it. I think it alleviates the pressure and I think that's a big part of what it, what it is for people. It. It alleviates the concern for the future like, Oh, you don't have to worry. God's got it. God's going to take care of it. Right? Everything happens for a reason. God's going to take everything does happen for a reason after it happens, right? That's right. Yeah. After it's over, you can go back and go, yeah, it happened for a reason, so it became this and that became who I am.

Speaker 2:          01:24:05       So it all happened for a reason. That's right. Okay. Yeah, you're right. But of course it usually what they made is somebody pulling the strings to make it happen. Not just the pathway that you happen to have gone down. Exactly. They always mean that God has some grand, very mysterious plan and kind of see how that feels good. Like, okay, I'm not alone. There's somebody watching that after me, not just my spouse and my friends and family, but you know, somebody out there somewhere and I can see why that feels good. So this is the problem atheists have, you know, it dot talks about this, like what do you say to somebody that's dying? It's like the Ricky Gervais' movie, the invention of line, you know, where he goes, he tells his mom, well, you know, you get, you get a mansion, everyone who dies gets a mansion, a mansion.

Speaker 2:          01:24:53       Oh yeah, it's great. And he goes on and then 10 minutes later in the movie, he's the Messiah because this meme got out. You know, it's a great story and you know, so we, we can't do that. If you're honest, you can't make up a story. So what do you say? So in secular humanist circles, it was articles about that. What do you say? And it's hard, you know, you can't, you can't promise it, but, you know, reminding people of what a great life they've had, you know, how much they've influenced the lives of other people, you know, and so on. That's really all we have. And um, you used the line from Woody Allen in there, you know, who says I don't want to live on, in my work I want to live on, in my apartment. Okay. I understand. And uh, but we, we don't get to do that.

Speaker 2:          01:25:34       No, we do not. And again, I want to go back to what I said earlier is that you are enjoying this partially because it's temporary. It's part of the thing about a day. Like you don't want to stay up forever, right? You want to enjoy the day and then at the end it's over. And that day is a microcosm of your life. Yeah. It's kind of fun to think, okay, I got eight hours here before, you know, it's dinnertime and, and so on. So I got to get my workout in and I get to write this and I get to make these calls. And it's kind of fun to kind of see how, if you can squeeze it all in. Yeah. And knowing that there is a time, if it was a 20 hour window, I, you know, I just started fucking around and like, Eh, get plenty of times I find I get more done as a person who's very busy with a family and children and all that stuff.

Speaker 2:          01:26:24       Right. I feel like I get more done because I don't have time to fuck off. I very rarely have time to fuck off. Yeah. I've been distracted the last six months or a year or so with a following twitter feeds that send interesting articles to read, which are interesting articles. There's a ton of really good content out there. And then podcasts, your podcast, sams and Dave Rubin and, and, and you know, just like, wow, this is all good. I really want to consume, but wait a minute, wait a minute, I'm not getting my workout in, I'm not doing this. And it's like, okay. So it's a good problem to have. It's a first world problem to have as they say. And I think what the transhumanists and the Ray Kurzweil thank is heaven would be something like that. Just endless streams of content that you enlist twitter feed. That's true.

Speaker 2:          01:27:09       Maybe that's not good. Yeah. I don't know. It could be hell yeah. I don't know what he wants. I mean I don't. The living forever thing is very problematic. It's like what? You are, be so outdated. Right? You know, you know, 100 years. Yes, totally. I just. And the downloading yourself into a computer thing too. What's to stop a guy like Kim Jong wound from downloading himself 100 times or a thousand or do it every day. Well, every day makes a new Kim Jong Il. This is one reason that these cult leaders, they do try to do that through lots of sex. That is kind of what they're doing. Right, right. Yeah. Wow. Setting, they're setting their genes out into the future as much as they can. Let me ask you this then. What is that? Why does that instinct exist? Like is that a purely approcreation instinct? Yeah, I think so.

Speaker 2:          01:27:59       Yeah. So you think that's the religious cult leader instincts? It's based entirely on some ancient reward system that's designed to get you to gingiss con your jeans out throughout the. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. You know, there's A. I have a chapter there and why? Why do we have to die? I mean, what? Why can't we just be programmed like infants are and babies, you know, the cells divide rapidly and they're super healthy. I have a young son now, he's 20 months. You know, when he gets a little cut, you could practically watch it heal. It's just incredible. And yet when I get a cut at 63 and it takes a couple of weeks to heal, it's like, why can't I? Can't the system keep going? And the answer is twofold. And second, law of thermodynamics, entropy, everything is running down and second natural selection programmed us to stay alive long enough to keep it, get our children's children into the reproductive age. After that, given that we have limited resources and energy in the system we live in, it's better to allocate the resources to the third generation say, rather than you, you don't need to live 150, 200 years, 60, 70 years. Your children's children are now in

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       their early twenties and having babies, you're done. As far as natural selection is concerned. Now I say it in a way like there's the czar of the secretary of the treasury that's allocating resources. You know, there's nothing like that. It's just natural selection. Selecting things for whatever's best for survival to get genes into the, into the future. So this is Dawkins' argument in the selfish gene that that the gene is the is. This is the thing we should be focused on, not the body. That natural selection kind of operates on the body, the phenotype that that gets expressed in a physical body, but the body's are just survival machines that the replicators build to keep going. So the replicators are immortal. The species is a mortal. In a sense. Our genome is a moral. That's why toxins called that river out of Eden. One of his book title that says that the river out of Eden is eternal as long as our species doesn't go extinct.

Speaker 1:          01:29:58       Uh, we, we live forever, but you and I as a, as just survival machines were just the gene's way of keeping itself to the next generation. So you're really only good for maybe 60, 70 years for a human timescale. You know, your kids, kids get to survival age, you're done. And this is the problem of that. All the radical life extension has had the whole system starts to fall apart at around the same time, like mid to late eighties. Things start falling apart. If you can make it into your nineties and you're still reasonably healthy, that's really good. Maybe you had Mel Gibson and his doc on, you know, with the stem cells, all that stuff is only going to push this further further more of us to the upper ceiling. We're not going to break through that upper sending about 120 without something hugely, completely re-engineered.

Speaker 1:          01:30:44       There may be a crisper technology that re engineered the genome to stop all this stuff from happening. But you know, we have 4 billion years, well three and a half billion years or so of life, of that continuity of the genome and it's all built into there. And every single system, every cell, all parts of your yourself, they're all going to age. And so, you know, when people like Aubrey de grey, I don't know if you know, got that long. Oh yeah. Yeah. He's great. I love this guy and I love that. That beer is his favorite thing that he thinks is going to be part of the process. Okay. I'll have a few beers if this is going to help and even if it.

Speaker 2:          01:31:20       That's okay. Yeah. That was one of the things that may be most skeptical of him. It was at the beer that's an amino suppressant drinking poison. Yeah. I mean it's a mild poison. That's delicious model. That's not good to drink this shit all day long. I was like, this is weird. And I was talking to somebody that interviewed him and said he was clearly drunk, like I was like, really? And she was like, yeah, I interviewed him. He was drunk drinking beer and he was drunk and she was like, and it wasn't. It wasn't late in the day either. Started started is just gets hammered. Does Science Fountain of Youth Very early? Yeah. He's a fascinating guy too, because he's not really much for exercise either. Now a nutrition, a lot of these guys that are into this, they don't. To me, they don't look healthy.

Speaker 2:          01:32:04       No, no. It's the one thing we know for sure in terms of longevity to get you closer to the upper ceiling and more of is don't smoke. Don't drink too much. Exercise every day. Especially Cardio, you know, and, and just eat right. Eat healthy foods. Whole foods, you know that I'm relieved to hear you know that. Meat and eggs and butter. This is all okay now. Good. Because it always felt like this was a balance with the salads. Salads are good too. What's good? What's not good? Sugar is the devil. That's the worst. That's right. And it's amazing how. Now I love listening to your podcasts with Nina Teicholz. Tie. Shoulds. Yes. Because I totally related to the, you know, I went through my. No meat stage and I just eat down in these huge bowls of quaker Granola, which is incredibly addictive because it's sugar and this.

Speaker 2:          01:32:55       I was cycling a lot and I wasn't. Not only was I not losing weight, I'm putting weight on. I got to like carrying around this extra 10 pounds, but I'm eating granola. It's healthy. No. Well, especially the Granola that most people bothered us. Sugar just laced all over it. Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot of people that eat things that they think are healthy. There's this great bread that my wife brought home. It was like a dave's super bread or some shit like that. I forget what it's called, but I bit into it and I was like, this is, this is cake. Yes. This might as well be cake. And then I looked at it and there's like massive amounts of sugar. Absolutely. Oh, okay. I didn't even realize how much sugar is in bread till my wife's from Cologne, Germany, Jennifer, and you know, they, they have real bread in Germany.

Speaker 2:          01:33:41       I mean you pick up a loaf of bread, it's like four pounds. It's like a thing, a lead because it's got nuts and it's super heavy and rich and there's no sugar and it tastes very different, but once you get used to it, it's way better. Well, it's also they're dealing with heirloom wheat in most of the European countries. What we've done from I guess the early 19 hundreds of slowly change what we used to be into. My friend Maynard explained it to me because he has a restaurant and he get. They grow pasta that's from heirloom wheat and he said that the wheat that you're getting today, we have the same amount of acres. You get a much higher yield is a bigger plant. It's a big fluffy thing and it also has much more complex gluten's in it so people have more of an issue digesting it. You're getting like a lot more gluten insensitivity today than we've ever had before and that's all because of this manipulated wheat. So we started buying pasta from Italy. You can get heirloom pasta that's grown in Europe and it just. It tastes different. It makes you feel different when you. It doesn't feel like a brick in your stomach. Right? I mean, it's still pasta. It's still carbohydrates. It's, it's not the best stuff for you, but it's certainly better and it gives your body a better or feeling,

Speaker 3:          01:34:58       right? Yup. Bread without sugar. Pasta without sugar. Yeah. Well you're going to get some. Yeah. It's just, it's different. It's, and you know, bread like bread is just bread. It's not good for you.

Speaker 1:          01:35:08       It's not. I love that story from Gary Tubbs that um, you know, when they started, uh, taking, um, when they started making the transition from eating meat to eating carbohydrates and it tasted like crap. It's like people don't want to eat cardboard, so we got to put something in there to make it taste good. Sugar. Yup. He was like, oh, right. That was like 19 sixties, late fifties after Eisenhower had his heart attack. And then that whole meme of the dietary fat equals a cardiovascular heart disease. Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:35:38       Well, I'm sure you read the New York Times article about how the sugar industry bribe scientists to say that sugar was the issue with heart disease and to take the blame, excuse me, to take the blame off sugar and put the blame on saturated fat. It's stunning. It's stunning how many people to this day will just parrot that back and the fact that saturated fat is terrible for it, right? Like meanwhile, it's no cholesterol terrible for, you know, it's actually the building blocks for hormones, right? It's literally the substrate for hormones, right? That's what your body is made of, the cell, the cell walls, or you need cholesterol to build those. Say that. The people that like, what are you talking about? You're crazy. Less going to kill you. It's going to kill you. Michael Shermer, right? Yeah. Yeah. It's weird. Nina's book is excellent, and then there's quite a few books.

Speaker 3:          01:36:28       Gary Tobbs book is excellent as well. There's, you know, there's a lot of people now that are shifting their diet over to, you know me, you can call it Paleo or Marxists and calls it primal primal blueprint. Essentially just eating vegetables and fish and meat and eating healthy things, eating Avocados and coconut oil and you know, and healthy fats and that's what your body craves. Right. And once you get used to it, one of the things that's incredibly beneficial is I tell people I don't get hungry during the day. Like most people, I'm not starving. Right. And I don't crash, like I don't need an, I don't need naps. Like what, what do you have for breakfast or before you eat? Before a workout or after I eat after a workout when I like to do is fasted cardio. Usually run in the morning or do yoga in the morning with no, no food in my stomach.

Speaker 3:          01:37:14       So it's like 11 or 12 before you eat. Or I had eggs and eggs for breakfast. Yeah. And Avocado and um, you know, like last night I had steak and I'm an avocado. Like I'm eating mostly that'll hold you through the workout about 10 or 11 in the morning and I'm fine now. What we have after a workout, um, depends. Maybe a protein shake. I'm really depends entirely. Today haven't worked out yet. So I just had breakfast, right, but most of what I'm eating is whole foods, healthy whole foods. I'd still eat plenty of salad. I still yet, but I very rarely I'll indulge and carbohydrates, like I had a cheeseburger from five guys on Sunday.

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       Every now and then I'll dive in. That's right. I think if you're working out a lot you can. He can tolerate a little bit more of that. Yeah. Just give yourself a little cheat day. You feel better about it. You don't feel. You feel like you're constantly depriving yourself. But overall I feel great. Yeah. We do some long three hour bike rides up in Santa Barbara where I live now. There's a group at pretty seriously effected by. No, no, I was just north of that. The firearms. Yeah. But I was trapped there, you know, it was like being on an island. The only way out is to go five hours north and around to get to La. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. For about three weeks. The only way to get to La is you had to go up to Santa Maria, take the one 66 over the five year practically in Bakersfield and then five south to la.

Speaker 1:          01:38:40       Yes. Yeah. So the one on one was shut down, completely shut down and all that. There's only like a feud side roads that parallel and they were all close because they were covered in mud and also all the trucks and um, and, and equipment that construction equipment to get the mud out of there. They just opened it to a Sunday night. That's incredible. So for awhile they had fairies at a ferry from Santa Barbara to Ventura. Of course you take the ferry Ventura, then you don't have a car. Then you know, you get an uber to la or something crazy. Mud slides were insane. CDOT Oprah, Oprah was there the next day. I think she must've. Helicopter didn't obviously, but uh, Mr. House by like 50 feet, something like that. Oprah is their magic. We may have injured. See, we may have another western White House in Santa Barbara, the Reagan ranch where he had his western White House houses north of Santa Barbara.

Speaker 1:          01:39:35       You think Oprah is going to win? She's going to run for president. She, I don't know if she's going to run, but I. The world we live in now. She could. When you think so. She's a pretty good speaker. She's not bad. She's a good speaker. Yeah. This is what I always bring up with Oprah. Do you remember when Oprah was a big supporter of the secret? Oh, totally. Yes. I know we've debunked her stuff because she's always open to woo woo stuff. She was super open to that. She was, we did the calculation. She was like 50 then. Yeah. She wasn't a young, dumb kid and didn't know any better. Nope. You know, and uh, I mean, she's a living testimony to what you can do if you put your mind to it, you want, use your intelligence and hard work. And she had a television show that was fun to watch and it was great for women.

Speaker 1:          01:40:17       It was like she sort of, she filled a niche that wasn't, wasn't filled before. Yeah, there's some. Okay. So we have to make a distinction between the kinds of things that say a Tony Robbins or maybe even a Jordan Peterson would say, like, here, here are some things you could do that'll help you be more successful, you know, set your goals, write them down every morning when you get up, you have a plan, you know, like Jocko says, you don't have your running your workout clothes ready to go so you're not fumbling around and give up, you know, it's almost like you're betting on your future self. I know this is what I'm going to be like in 12 hours, so I'm going to do something now. That's good. Uh,

Speaker 2:          01:40:53       you know, in Jordan has his book. Here's the 12 things you gotta do to do what? Well, to be successful. Okay. So, you know, Oprah Kinda, I think did those things intuitively just as a, you know, just what she did. That's how she became successful, which has nothing to do with. If I tell the universe I want a Lamborghini, it's kind of up here in my driveway, you know, and then, then the, the other deeper problem with that was that this implies that what if I'm not successful? You just weren't thinking positive. You mean these poor people in Somalia or even worse. What about children with the disease? So they thinking, well, yeah, yeah. It's no good. So the idea that you, your entire existence is based entirely inside of your own imagination. It's just preposterous. There's a lot of random shit that's going on in this world.

Speaker 2:          01:41:38       Some parts of the world get hit by meteors. Were they bad people there? No. Well, how come? How come Putin didn't get hit by a meteor assassinating rivals and god is still a. It was just a lot of people out there that are terrible people that just state through. That's right. Somehow or another problem of evil. Why do bad things happen to good people? And good things happen to bad? Sometimes they do. Right? The problem with the, the secret is that if you're successful and you know you have this story of I just imagined it and I willed it into being and look, here I am, you can do it too, right? I'm sorta how many people also willed it into being. It didn't work. Like let's get the full numbers. How many people daydreaming all day and they never got that pony. You know, I call this the biography bias.

Speaker 2:          01:42:31       People write biographies of Steve Jobs. Okay, so here's the thing. You enroll in a really elite college dropout. Move back to your parents' house. It started a startup company in your garage. It works actually how many people did this in the seventies and they did start up companies and they went out of business in three months or whatever. You have to have a good product now and no one writes a biography of them, right? So we only hear the hits, forget the Mrs, but at least those people, even if they failed, they took a shot at something. They're trying to make something happen. It fails. They could try something else. And maybe the third, fourth, fifth one will take, but the idea of the secret is the most preposterous thing ever was because you're sitting around imagining that you're going to will it into existence, the perfect spouse, the perfect home, the perfect family, and you would just sit and dream about it and write it down and put pictures of it up on the wall.

Speaker 2:          01:43:20       And then you would make it happen. Like, no, you got to go do things, you gotta to do it and to do things. And it's this. The one thing that keeps people from achieving things is the actually going out and doing things. For whatever reason, we have this blockade against action, right? People are terrified of the unknown, just like we're terrified of death, right? Terrified of the unknown. You have the role of chance is huge and we don't, uh, we, we forget to see the failures. I was a ride the other day with a guy, you know, what do you do? I'm a, a venture

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       capitalist. So what's the ratio? I mean, you have the, you put in 200,000, $500,000, half pay. What? And he goes, no, 90 percent fail because I get it. I said, you nine out of 10 companies, you invest half a million or whatever it's gone. He goes, Yep. But the one, you know, the one I made $20 million dollars on, you know, more than makes up for the nine failures. Like, Oh wow, you know, that's a high ratio. So there's, um, I know there's research on entrepreneurs and how risk taking you should be. So entrepreneurs score high and risk taking, you know, they're, they're, they're not risk averse. Okay, that's good. But on the other hand, some of them have what's called the over optimism bias. They just never give up. This is, this is the idea. I'm sticking with it. I'm going to keep pouring money into it.

Speaker 1:          01:44:33       No, dude, nine out of 10 fail. Just keep trying until you get the one. You at some point you got to be a risk taker, but not too crazy. You gotta know when to bail. You got to know when to bail. Yeah. Yup. Well that's a crazy way to make a living. Yeah. Well, you know, on other people to. Oh, I know. Do you ever watch shark tank? Sometimes my wife and I've been binge watching shark tank. The stuff that people come up with, you know, I mean it's like some of them are just ridiculous, but I think it's kind of like American idol where they get let those ridiculous people on because it's entertaining. It's half the fun is watching people's preposterous ideas through that. The other night he had a little of this little chip thing he put over the computer, um, the camera so that, you know, the NSA or whoever can't watch you watch in it.

Speaker 1:          01:45:15       And he's like, okay, so here's the thing, you know, I'm going to sell it for nine 95 and if we get one percent of the market, blah, blah, blah, you know, we're all going to be billionaires. And then one of the sharks said, what? You just put a piece of tape over there. I, I think I saw mark Zuckerberg put a piece of duck tape on his, over the camera. Oh yeah. You know, or, or somebody else said it'd be fun if you had a little thing he put over it. And there was an image on the inside, it was like this, you know something. Imagine that the type

Speaker 2:          01:45:43       cyber person that would have to be sitting around all day waiting for you to turn your laptop camera on. Come on, let me see what you're doing. And they must have algorithms that just look and scan and try to find it. I don't know. I could only imagine what's up and stuff that came out over the weekend. I will tell you about that. Snowden was really leading the sound of your, oh, the Nsa knows who you are, just by the sound of your voice. And their tech predates apple and Amazon or report on the intercept, citing documents leaked by former NSA contractor, Edward Snowden revealed that the NSA has highly refined [inaudible] voice recognition software. The agency's technology dates back more than a decade and was instrumental in helping to identify Saddam Hussein after the invasion of Iraq. The reports dated, uh, your voice were just in the room with your laptop, or you mean on the phone? Supposedly it can now. They can use almost any microphone that's connected to the Internet. Every letter in your voice, they're the recognition they have is better than a face print or a fingerprint. So if they wanted to find young Jamie that could get you or laptop already have it. Wow. This is saying or you have had it and don't worry about it. Like there's almost nothing you can. What is your thoughts on snowden and then who's the other guy?

Speaker 2:          01:47:02       I have A. I have a bad feeling about Julia. Jay have a good feeling about snowden. Do you have everybody had a good feeling about a sausage? Yeah. Trump got into office. No, no. The stuff before that, I didn't care for him, but I saw a snowden made an appearance at Ted was the last 10 I went to in Vancouver. Then they rolled them out on a computer, big screen and there he was in Russia or somewhere. Right. But the points he made were similar to that of Daniel Ellsberg and the Pentagon papers. It's like we should know what our government is doing. We don't have to know everything. You don't have to share the nuclear codes with uni, but you know, at some point, you know, there's some line there how much freedom versus security and, and uh, you know, there's too much stuff going on.

Speaker 2:          01:47:45       Even in the Obama administration, that administration of transparency, this is when a lot of this stuff was happening and say, wait a minute. I thought it was Bush that was doing this kind of stuff, but when we have to remember that Edward Snowden went into hiding during the Obama administration, one of the worst administrations ever on record for, with whistleblowers. Right. Which is really crazy because if you go look at the hope and change website when it initially existed, one of the big promises was protection for whistleblowers exposing illegal activity and that's just not true yet. I think he should be allowed to come back. Yes. He doesn't have to be. Worship is a hero. It's just like this. He said brave person before him. We didn't know we were talking about any of this stuff. I didn't know about this stuff. While there was some, there was an NSA contractor from many years ago who brought this stuff up and he was sort of dismissed.

Speaker 2:          01:48:36       What is his name? He was the original NSA contractor that brought this up, I want to say in 2011. Um, probably could see him in my mind. I can't remember his name. That's it. Bill Binney. I'm not sure who that pull that pull that guy out. Young Jamie I just read was the original guy. Bill Benny, the original NSA whistleblower on snowden nine slash 11 and illegal surveillance. This was, he became incredibly concerned post nine slash 11 when they started, uh, doing a lot of this in the initial work on computer surveillance and all this stuff they were doing. And he bailed and interesting. And you started talking about it openly and publicly. And then snowden came out after that. And the snowden thing was where people got all [inaudible] look what we're really got a chance to understand, oh, this is actually happening right now. This is a real thing, right?

Speaker 2:          01:49:28       Yeah. I do think the government does overreach with their security theater. You know, we're at orange level today, remember that believable. It doesn't happen anymore. What happened to that? And yet the number of Americans that die from foreign terrorism. I mean, there are some of the domestic terrorist if you want to consider mass public shootings in that category, but foreign terrorists coming here to kill Americans. Uh, uh, I mean, what, what is, is, is less than bathtub. Drownings are weightless and they like lightning struck double lightening strikes or something. I mean, it's just nothing. It's like shark attacks. Yeah. Alright. It's just why are we spending billions and billions of dollars on this? It's because they put. That was. They could, yeah. Yeah. It's like, it's like the proverbial elephant repellent you'd ever. Since we put the repellent here, not a single elephant is going to end. Oh yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:50:14       Okay. Well, Michael Sherman, we're Americans. We don't want to get caught with our pants down. I understand. And you know, it's there. I just read Daniel Ellsberg's new book, the Doomsday Machine. This is on nuclear deterrence. He's against nuclear. He thinks nuclear deterrence as a, as a rational strategy is, is a longterm mistake because of the possibilities of error, which, you know, it's all good points, but he has, I'm not sure why it took so long to bring this book out. He's got his notes when he worked for the State Department in the fifties, and then the rand corporation in the early sixties during the Kennedy Administration of the kinds of calculations that go, our own government was making about how many people we were willing to kill in defense, you know, hundreds of millions of Russians just, you know, she was like, oh, it's like the scene from um, uh, Dr strangelove where George C dot Scott, you know, he's like, I'm not saying we wouldn't get our hair mussed, but 20, 30 million tops.

Speaker 2:          01:51:05       And that's actually real. That's the kind of numbers they were throwing out. Yeah. You can't leave a human being without much responsibility and power. And I think that's the bottom line when it comes to this NSA surveillance things that all these government agencies are populated by human beings and human beings should not have that kind of power over other human beings that are just citizens. Right? Because they're just the, the ability to check all the snowden talked about people being able to check in on their exes and read their emails and they were doing things like that. And this is when Obama was like, no, no, this is just better data. It wasn't just metadata, man, whoever. They were looking at everything and it, that's, that's something we should know about. And we didn't until snowden and now this poor guy has to live in Russia.

Speaker 2:          01:51:51       Yep. Nope, I think he should be brought back for sure. But could he be, he would have to do something awesome for trump. Might be after trump. I Dunno, I dunno. Maybe. Maybe he jumps out that of all people. It's Putin who's protecting it. It's like, wait a minute, what? I know it's weird. Well, he's probably helping, but. But when he makes. If you watched the Ted Ted talk, Ted to interview, Chris Anderson was just talking to them on the stage when from undisclosed location in Russia, you can't come up totally reasonable. This is what democracy. Here's a democracy. This is what we live in. Citizens need to know some things. Not everything came up totally rational. He did a great podcast with Neil degrasse Tyson and he came off very rational there as well. Oh, I didn't know neal, uh, interview. Um, look, we, we don't agree to that kind of surveillance.

Speaker 2:          01:52:42       That's, that's very orwellian. It's not what we want, right? This is not, you're not stopping terrorism. No. You just spying on people. And also people are rightly concerned that anything that they find could be used against you if you are a political opponent of theirs or if there's something that you're trying to oppose and they go, Hey, well, you know, we found out the year in the cuckold porn buddy or whatever it is. You know, it's just, there's too much tennis stuff. Nixon did with the, um, with the hoover Jesuit horror and the FBI. Well, I think whoever did it on his own right, he did, it predicts. It was a fascinating character, you know, crossdresser as mind freak, just like spying on everybody just to try to hide his own secrets. Really amazing. But there's an example of one person flawed human, like everyone else given all this power and imagine what hoover would do today with the Internet.

Speaker 2:          01:53:37       I mean he, he, he, Oh God. Arguably more flawed than normal human beings. And I think that goes back to the thing that you were talking about with these cult leaders. It's like humans should not have power over other humans, right? When they do, they do terrible things and they abuse that power and they mean it's the responsibility that one would have to be able to do that. George C dot Scott thing and say, God, 20 million, 30 million, no big deal. It a few people in Chicago, right? I mean, that is, that's a crazy thing for a human being to have at their fingertips. Yep. Yep. And the other problem is bureaucracy, any large organization, but especially bureaucracies, their tendency is to keep alive. We gotta keep our, keep our jobs and uh, and, and the moment you set up a government agencies, it's really difficult to shut it off.

Speaker 2:          01:54:30       Yeah, almost impossible because you have real people with jobs and mortgages and families that I get to keep my job, so we have to justify why we need our department and so on. And it just always builds that way. But that is the big issue with big government is it just grows bigger. It does, it never shrinks. They never say, Oh, you know what? We don't need the irs. Right. This is nonsense. We just, you know, we realized that if we don't have the irs, we have to pay so many less people that we can actually get less money in taxes from folks. Right. What, what? Yeah. No, it's A. Yeah, it's just a huge problem. I don't have a good solution to it. Well, it brings me back to the last word of the title of your book. The scientific search for the afterlife.

Speaker 2:          01:55:11       Immortality and Utopia. Utopia. Yeah. Hope is what we're always looking for. Yeah, totally. And it doesn't exist. It can't ever exist. Not even in principle because there is no right society because we have so much variation in our interests and needs and wants and your abilities and you know the idea of programming by fed from the top down, this is what we're going to do and it's going to work or else you're out and this. The problem with utilitarianism is get you that utilitarian calculus of the greatest good for the greatest number and we know what that is and are standing

Speaker 1:          01:55:43       in our way. You are preventing utopia, so we are going to eliminate you. You know this is the famous trolley experiment, a thought experiment. You know the trolleys hurdling down the tracks about to kill the five workers. You're at the switch. If you throw the switch, it'll go down a sidetrack. It'll kill one worker. Would you throw the switch? Skilled the one to save the five, the five? We're going to die if you don't do anything. So we did throw the switch some. Most people say they would, that you can go on the website and do this yourself and son who's on track. Yeah, it really does. It's rush limbaugh on this one track she imagined and five school kids. Yeah, with massive potential for the future. But uh, so now most people said they would flip the switch, but in an interesting twist on that.

Speaker 1:          01:56:31       So if, if, if you're standing on a bridge over the track and the train is hurdling down the tracks about to kill the five workers and standing next to you is a great big guy. Would you hip check him off? Boom. He lands on the tracks. SPLAT. He's killed by the train, but it stops it and saves the five workers. Now most people say I got to physically grab them and throw them up. Yeah, no, I, I couldn't do that. So it's something to do with. It engages the emotional part of the brain that actively killing somebody is way harder than passively killing. So if you only have to put, if you're at a 52 bomber, 35,000 feet up, you only have to press the button to release the bombs. Not so

Speaker 3:          01:57:07       heart, but that's even more actively doing it than a drone. The drone, which apparently is a giant issue for the drone pilots, apparently they suffer from really weird Brill Esd even though they're in Arizona doing it in a rack or whatever. Yeah, the nightmares. I mean, they're pretty intense. Interesting. I had not, I hadn't heard that. Yeah, I mean, if you're looking at a screen and you're seeing someone on the other side of the planet, you know, you're in Nevada, right? And some military base, right? And you're hitting that button and you're watching the screen. You're seeing some, you know, infrared or black night vision, right? This'll slamming into the person that you were just observing

Speaker 1:          01:57:51       movie about that, that was like the trolley problem than it was maybe two years ago. Um, where, um, the decision is to be made. Well, the setup is we know that the terrorists and are making a bomb inside this building and we can get a drone there to, to hit it. And so they're about to do. This is toward the beginning of, they're about to do this. And this little girl walks into the scene and she's selling bread. I think it's in Afghanistan or Iraq. So she's on the corner so she will be killed and it's like, oh, okay, maybe we could come around from the other side and then she won't be in there doing all these calculations. But now there's some other people over here. So how many people innocence should we kill because we know that the terrorists are going to, if they complete their bomb bomb, a suicide bomb, they're going to go to a mall and killed 300 people or whatever. So they, those, you know, how these

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       government agencies think about those calculations, you know, we, we, we, we got to stop the bad guys, but how many good people are we willing to kill to prevent them from killing even more? We think maybe if they do this and then it gets murky from there. Well Mike Baker, who's a former, a big wig at the CIA, have talked to him several times on the podcast. One of the things that he says that's done by lawyers, right? That's right. That's right. Because there, there's, there's legal precedence about collateral damage that came from the Nuremberg laws and they're, you know, there's some questionable stuff. We were doing, I mean, I think it's justified second world war, but you know, the mass bombing of Hamburg and addressed in this didn't slow the Nazi or machine at all, but the idea was that, well, the citizens will rise up and kill Hitler.

Speaker 2:          01:59:30       No, they, you know, that you can't. And in that kind of society you just don't have that kind of access or power. And uh, you know, this was like when in the first Iraq war, you know, we'll, we'll stop short, you know, Bush senior said we're going to stop short and let Saddam's own people taking them out and have their own regime change and then we'll support the new regime and it just didn't work out that way. So they are, the calculations get messy. I got kind of sidetracked. The problem with Utopian idea is that utilitarian calculus. If, if most people will agree that it's okay to kill one to save five, why not kill 1 million to save $5 million? That's genocide. And that is the calculator calculations that genocidal, mass murderers make know that are our German society would be great except for those Jews, you know, the backstab, the backstabbers who, who ruined us in the first world war.

Speaker 2:          02:00:18       Now we can just get rid of them. It's going to be great. And every genocide is based on that kind of utilitarian calculus. However emotional driven it is. And it's, it's interesting when you look at the numbers from drone attacks, it's some high, 80, 90 percent of innocent people are killed, right? The casualties, um, when you look at it in terms of what the actual targets that we're looking for versus the actual people that were killed, right? Collateral damage. There's a tremendous amount of collateral damage. And that's not something that we would ever accept from one guy. Say if we had one guy with a howitzer and he just went in there and he says, blasting women and children to get to the guy that's in the top of the building, there would be no fucking way. No going back, I as a murderer, he's a monster.

Speaker 2:          02:01:05       But if one guy in Nevada presses a button and some hellfire missiles come shooting out of a flying robot and they slam into that building and kill everybody, including this one terrorist that we were after, except it. Right? So in game theory, there's this problem of this sort of sliding scale that, okay, I know it's like the milgram shock experiment of 15 bolts at a time. You know, before you know it, you're throwing 450 volts and it is subject. You couldn't get somebody to do that initially. But if you do it incrementally, you know, the, the, the kind of hoping, well if I hold out and just do one more, maybe the end.

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       And it's like this with these kind of utilitarian calculus. Okay, I know I probably shouldn't be doing this, you know, these collateral damage or the. But if we can. But if we keep going, we'll end the war and then that'll stop the other kind of killing. We do want to stop but it. But it's always so messy that it takes much longer than you think. So you can kind of see the logic like, okay, I don't know if you watch Ken Burns' documentary series, the Vietnam War, but it kind of felt like that the whole time, like this is when we see at the end, it's like God, this was like a task strappy, but at every step, you know, Kennedy than Johnson and Nixon is like, okay, we can't give up now. You know, the sunk cost fallacy, you know, we put all this in there, just one more month and then we'll get out and then the month comes like, okay, we're not going to wait another month, another year. And then before, you know, you got 58,000 dead and it's like okay, this just didn't work. And I think that happens more often because it's always messier.

Speaker 2:          02:02:33       Yeah, that makes sense. I mean, war itself is an incredibly messy business.

Speaker 1:          02:02:39       Do you know it's, it's, it's outlawed. It was outlawed in the Paris peace agreements of 19, 27. War is illegal. So a great book called the internationalists. It gives the history of how this came about and that and the reason for it. So they gave them the whole history going all the way back to when war became legal and it goes all the way back to this, uh, Spanish and Dutch conflict they were having. And I forget who did what, but a Spanish ship confiscated a Dutch ship and took all that stuff. And uh, and then there was like a legal battle about this and whichever side, I think it was, the Spanish said, no, no, actually, uh, we were, we were at war and if you're at war, it's okay to be a pirate and kill people and stuff like that. And so, um, this Hugo grosses, legal scholar wrote all this treaties that got laid down that said this is when war is legal.

Speaker 1:          02:03:30       It's perfectly okay to kill other people and take their stuff if you're at war. So what does that mean to be a war? You know, so then it's legal, it's all, it's all done by lawyers. Like, okay, this is what it is. And we have lived with that ever since. So in the 19, 27, the Paris peace or even said, okay, you know, we're going to stop that war is illegal now obviously this didn't stop Hitler and imperial Japan and so on. But at least now a leaders have to justify it. It's like a Bush had to go to the UN and get his coalition of the willing. And that's when Colin Powell to say, Oh yes, we know about the yellow cake and that Saddam Hussein wants nuclear weapons it. I mean, why would anybody bother with all that stuff? In the old days they just invade, you know, I came, I saw, I conquered it, took my stuff, and now you have to say I came, I saw I was just standing there minding my own business and he punched me. So I invaded in. You at least have to do that.

Speaker 2:          02:04:23       It's sort of like what we were talking about earlier that the world today, I mean their consciously recognizing that there are more rules and that society is a much more complex and safer place to be and they want to protect that progress in some way. And that's what the rules of war in comparison to 2000 years ago. Right? So that's a good thing. Yeah. I mean, it doesn't stop everybody, but even Kim, John Wooten, I kind of have a feeling that maybe I'm naive that it's just deterrent for him. He wants to take a place at the table where he's respected. His country is not going to be invaded. And uh, this is sort of a, a Noam Chomsky argument that I usually make, but if you look at how America treats other countries, if they have nukes, we leave them alone. If they don't, we do whatever we kind of feel like.

Speaker 2:          02:05:12       So from his perspective, it could be those Americans because you see, they make arguments like this, these Americans are evil. Why? Look they invaded this country. They made that they've been in, you know, a dozen wars and just never ending. This is who they are. We're going to get new books and they're gonna they're not gonna fuck with this ever again. And maybe that's, maybe he'll just stop and go, that's it. Okay. You leave me alone. I'll leave you alone. I don't agree with Noam Chomsky on everything, but I'm, I'm very happy there's someone like him out there who's a brilliant guy that's as far left as you can get. Yeah. He's way out there. I think it's important to balance these intellectual disagreements and you know, you need a super smart far left. He guy wearing a sweater. Excellent moves.

Speaker 2:          02:06:02       Right? Well, I agree. So that's why we have to have free speech and open dialogue and debate with the guy over here to counter the guy, you know. So that's my instead of like authoritarian left. Well why are they there? Because there's an authoritarian, right? Yes. The problem is we expect that from the right. So this is why we're going through what we're going through now. It's kind of a surprise. Wait a minute. The liberals are doing this. Well, it's fairly recent. Yeah. You know the silencing of people you disagree with and also the really disingenuous labeling of people's Nazis or a neo Nazis are white supremacist just because they simply don't line up with your beliefs of state and it's a conscious decision to do that. It's this isn't like an accidental mislabeling, we don't really know what the person's motives and who they are. No, you're just trying to diminish whatever position they have so that your side wins and I think a lot of people feel justified by it because of the current administration and it just seems like we're on a God damn pirate ship now.

Speaker 2:          02:07:03       I mean, it seems like when you're seeing what's going on with the erosion of the EPA and the decision to start drooling, really, he made a sweeping decision that you could drill anywhere. Right? Go ahead offshore. Go ahead. Just start drilling that ocean. The fish oil baby. Come on, I'll be in my gold bathroom. Giant gold chandelier over the toilet. Guy Is crazy. It's just a strange time. It's like something out of a movie. Oh, it's way crazier than something out of a movie. If there was a president that was this nuts in a movie, you would say, that's too over the top. We played a video yesterday of trump that looked at 24 different things that trump said he was the best at nobody. Nobody. Nobody loves women more than I do. Nobody loves Mexicans more than I do and nobody. Nobody's better at foreign policy than trump uses himself in the third person who saw like oprah as a president, can we just have like professional experts that work in this area that know what they're doing, even if they're not celebrities?

Speaker 2:          02:08:13       Well, I'm, I'm a firm believer that that position is almost always abused and that will, we really need instead of like one person is like a council of why the tribunal or something like that. 18 super smart people that have to write papers on all these different decisions that they make and I'd be happy with it. With the tribe instead of a president, you have three people, you elect him and then for anything to happen to it, the three have to agree, but even three because the FCC, they. They took out net and it was only five people. Five unelected people. That's a good point. Yeah. Maybe. Yeah. Maybe 18. Yeah. Yeah, I don't. Well, you need an odd number so you don't have a tie breaker. Yeah. We had Jessica Rosenworcel, his last name from the FCC, she was one of the five that voted for net neutrality.

Speaker 2:          02:09:08       She wanted to keep it in place and she was on two weeks ago, something like that. And describing to us like what the situation is like and how there's only five people and they're not elected and they get to decide how, how did they get that? They're appointed, appointed by the president. Um, I don't know if they're appointed by trump or maybe they are holdovers from apparently easy to stack. Is that what she said? President Obama or trump says, uh, appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate for five year terms. Okay. There you go. So these are new folks then. Okay. Yeah. And they decided, no, let's just give all the money in the corporation. So instead them just block websites and get crazy with throttling in writing. Right. It's a weird time for this. Yes. Right. So back to the utopia. Societies are messy and the only, the only Utopian type system would be one that there is no system.

Speaker 2:          02:10:07       You'd have checks, just nothing but checks and balances because these catch basins of power, again, back to the colts, they inevitably form and anybody wants more power if they can get it. It's just human nature, right? It's human nature. You it go back to where we're social primates bases. The alpha male is going to, if he can get there, he's going to stay there for as long as he can and the Beta males are going to try to under undermine and from out from underneath this constant struggle. Again, there are two kinds of men. Those would loaded revolvers and those who did so well. That's why you know this, again, sort of a horizontal bottom up. Networking systems is one way to try to counter the hierarchical power structures. It's not, it doesn't always work, but now as someone who spends so much time looking for actual truth and facts and scientific data, how concerned are you about the media today?

Speaker 2:          02:11:09       Because this, this term fake news, weird world of, of attacks on journalism and then even journalism itself falling short and then journalism in many venues trying to keep up with the Internet and putting out these salacious click baity headlines even like established media sources or doing some sleazy shit now. Yeah, it's a concern for sure. We have stay on top of it but, but there are solutions to this, like politifact for example, where they're not the only site snopes also ranking the factual basis of a speech in real time. And you can go on like politifact is trump's given a speech or during the campaign when they were all giving speeches and they would rank them, you know, from, you know, true. Mostly true, partially false, mostly faults, pants on fire. I love their ranking system. And uh, you know, trump, trump got a lot of pants on fire.

Speaker 2:          02:12:06       Yeah. Uh, so at least there's a counter to it. And now those sites are becoming pretty popular. Um, they're kind of a form of clickbait themselves. Let's go there and find out how many times this guy lied in his speech. So it would have been nice if we would've had that say in the Nixon administration or the Johnson administration like the Gulf of Tonkin, if this could have been, you know, a whistleblower and in called and put out there so that we didn't drag yourselves into the Vietnam war even deeper. My thought, and this is a very, a paranoid thought, is that all this is inevitably opening us up to the truth chip to the mind, reading the chip. But if things are going to get so chaotic that we're going to say, you know what, just hit me with the chip. I can't fucking take this anymore. I don't know who's right. Fox News says one thing. CNN says another slide it in slide. I want in my forearm right here.

Speaker 2:          02:13:00       Yes. Solution. It might literally be like nature's way of allowing us to slowly accept the symbiotic relationships with this. This new artificial intelligence. I think webster's just this last week voted, uh, it was alternative facts is the word of the year phrase of the year for 2017 for the year before that, it was fake. Fake news with Sean Spicer said alternative facts. Right. It was forced to try to like Kellyanne conway after the inaugural. A, uh, size of the audience. Yeah. And, uh, he said, look at a picture. Uh, it's not as big as a. well, that's where. Did you get that number? That was an alternative fact. Yeah. They seem to like keep her locked up more now. She seems to be less less. She just keeps stuffing her foot in her mouth. Yeah. Well, they all have to because the end of the boss sends him out to tell them this. Okay.

Speaker 2:          02:13:54       Can you imagine that's poor Sean Spicer guy when he talks about it now it's like a guy who's just been freed from prison. Right? Well, he's probably making a lot of money on the lecture circuit now. Oh, I can imagine. Yeah, probably. It's probably a very lucrative, but if you look at governments, you know, centuries past or thousands of years ago, they, you know, there was lying and corruption and all that. Oh, that's, that's old. Yeah. It's just now it's so blatant, the yellow press. I mean, where did that come from? That was, you know, the whoever told. No, it was hearst, William Randolph. First you gave me the war and I'll supply you the photographs or whatever. Yeah. So you know that that's fake news. That's literally affect news. The sinking of the Maine. Let's go to war. Well, you know what actually happened again? Gulf of Tonkin. Gulf of Tonkin.

Speaker 2:          02:14:43       Yeah. That Vietnam War. Documentary series. I just wanted to put my head in the oven after that and turn the gas. I was like, you know, this went on for so long, so many years. What did we in Afghanistan, I was 16 years now. Vietnam war. It wasn't quite that long, but if you look back to where it started in the fifties when we. We weren't at war, we were sending advisors there, you know, this kind of stuff. It's just a, it's so depressing. We like to think of our government is having enough checks and balances. I think we need more. I would like to think of our civilization as being something that aspires to a higher standard. Some like something that is more advanced because we've learned from the lessons of the thousands of years of written history and we we aspire to a greater set of values. So one of the things I like about Elon Musk's, let's go colonize Mars in addition to the technological problems.

Speaker 2:          02:15:34       How will they set up lift? There's 100 people. There are a thousand, 10,000. What kind of government are they going to have? What kind of me just maniacs and we'll do. It was so crazy to die on Mars. It's probably not going to be your average typical a human. You imagine you're going to take a six month spaceship visit through through the cosmos to land on a planet that you're going to die on. You will never come back coming back, unless they are so smart. They figure out a way to build a rocket and shoot back, which they probably won't know but that. But, so if you went in, you were advising like what kind of government would you set up or you know, sort of social organization to prevent people from stealing other people's stuff that we got to work cooperatively to plant a potato things and question, how do you do that? You know, we have thousands of years of experiments, but you know, it's, they're all messy. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       No one's ever done it. Right. Which is again, the utopian. Yeah, I mean, is it different to have, you know, 10 people, 100 people, 1000, 10,000, you know, there's a scaling effect where it becomes more efficient the more people you have. But on the other hand, then you get these power, you know, catch basins of power that grow and become corrupt. That's gotTa happen on Mars. It's going to happen. And also the community gets fractured because you don't know these people anymore and you get 5,000 people. There's no way you can know 5,000 people, $500. Right? There's Mike. Hey Mike. Yeah, that's right sally. You know those people, you get 5,000. You're like, who's that guy just flew here? He's from Chicago, now, those on Mars, but you know, even small hunter gatherer groups, they have conflicts all the time. They get to sit down in the dirt area in the Commons ground and talk about it.

Speaker 1:          02:17:17       And then you stole this pig and the pig died and now you alma pig. Okay, go get your pick. Okay, we're going to settle it. But what happens when someone dies? You know, it's like, okay, you owe 10 pigs. You know, they, they had these calculations like this is the equivalent of a life is 10 pigs and uh, that's going to happen no matter what planet we're living on. Did you get any personal insight? I'm sure you do have to. Every book you read, you read or you write rather. But did you get any unique personal insight into this? I did at the last chapter is on what does it mean to live a fulfilling on inspiring happiness, a fulfilled life? If there's no afterlife, there is no god, whatever. Or even if there is, it doesn't. Again, it doesn't really matter because we live in this world, so it turns out there's research that shows that striving for happiness is the wrong metric.

Speaker 1:          02:18:05       That's the wrong goal, that striving to live a purposeful, meaningful life is what we should be after and that often entails doing things that don't make you happy. They're not fun, they're not pleasurable. So like for example, when you work out, you know, it's not fun and in a sense of like a morphine drip, you know, I'm getting a lot of pleasure from this. Afterwards, you get a sense of endorphins and you feel better about yourself. Um, and so like there's research showing that if you go out for drinks with your friends to enter and so on, that's fun. It's pleasurable, but it's short term. A caretaking for a parent, for example. This shows that this is not fun at all. I've done this. Two of my four parents, I had step parents and this was not fun. It wasn't pleasurable. I didn't enjoy it, you know, schlepping my dad around to doctors and hospitals and you know, I was just drained by the end of the day doing this, but I felt better about myself.

Speaker 1:          02:18:56       So it turns out the research shows that, you know, if you have more longterm goals both forward and back, forward goals, back reflecting on your past, what you've done, not oriented toward being happy, but being, you know, sort of leading a purposeful, driven life. That's what makes people feel better about their lives. And really that's all we can do. And it's enough. It's enough to sort of feel like my life was well worth living. It's worth getting up in the morning without the promise of an afterlife. You don't need that just like this life. I can make a difference. I can get up this morning, do something that I may not enjoy it quite so much, but you know, working out, you know, like I do my three hour bike ride, you know, it's so good to get up at. I got to get up at 6:30 in the morning.

Speaker 1:          02:19:37       They roll out at seven. It's cold, partially dark, it's like I got to bundle up and then they gotta strip close off as I go, so I have to figure this all out and it's not fun. But you know, after, after the ride I'm like, I really feel great that I did this and yeah, I had fun with my buddies, but it's not fun. Like, you know, I had a drink with my friends and that was fun. That's a different kind of fun. So. And that funds okay, two times balance, but it shouldn't all be the fun, right? Yeah, I mean they're full meaningful, right. There are people that do that. So I talk about Diana Niad who I knew back in the 19 eighties when I was doing race across America, the transplant on a bike race and Diana worked for why we're live sports and they covered the race.

Speaker 1:          02:20:19       I would talk to her a lot. She's in the back of the truck with the camera crew. I'm riding along and uh, she's a really interesting person. She's an atheist, you know, she did the Cuba to Florida swim. She's an ultra marathon swimmer and uh, she failed to make it back in her twenties and she came back when she turned 60 and said I'm going to go for this again. And uh, it took her four years and I think for tries to do it, but she did it. So she appears on Oprah's super soul Sunday show she had for awhile and um, and Oprah's asking her will, how do you find on and you know, and meaning, you know, what do you believe? Well, I'm an atheist and she described how, how are awestruck she is about the universe and life and what science has told us.

Speaker 1:          02:20:59       And Solomon, Oprah says something like, well, I don't see how you can be an atheist if you're in, if you're on inspired. And then she says, I, I don't see why those are in contradiction. I mean, the whole, you know, living a meaningful life and being engaged in the world and other people that is spiritual, that is inspiring, that you know, you don't need God for that. And it was sort of an interesting exchange because Uber's was reflecting kind of a common theme that people have. You need God to have a meaningful life. And Diana's whole point was, no, you don't. You just have to be engaged with the world in some meaningful way. And that's enough. And on that note, Michael Shermer, heavens on earth, the scientific search for the afterlife, immortality and Utopia available now on Amazon and everywhere else. Thanks. Thank you brother. Appreciate it, man.
