It's not, it's definitely not practical to pay extra to have a gorilla's face molded perfectly and do a Kettlebell. Duh. I want one and I don't even want to use it. Yeah. I just want to have one. It's just a fun aspect of life people. Okay. Everything doesn't have to be practical. And when it is, does have to be practical, then it's that. Okay. And that's okay too. Both are okay.

Speaker 2:          00:05:10       Good job. Logan experience. What are you doing? I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:05:16       Was that an accident? That was an accident. Oops. Sorry folks. You know what the fuck's happening? Yeah, it's confusing. It's confusing to us to be Martin, thank you for coming and you for inviting me, man. I did not know Abby Martin as an artist and she gave me is fucking bad ass dope picture that she has created. It's very sexy. It is. Um, it's very pornographic. Can I say pornographic? If I was like one of those radical ministered type dudes, I would say it's pornographic. Of course there's some. Uh, thank you. So awesome. I didn't know that you are an artist. Yeah. You're a person who main towns indeed as as are you? Hmm hmm to shea. Are you in the porn who isn't? I mean like, do you watch it in a minute? Who isn't? I'm sure there's a lot of people. That's true.

Speaker 3:          00:06:02       I think a lot of people say that they don't watch it, but they're lying. Really. I, I do watch porn.

Speaker 1:          00:06:08       I think there's, um, there's an idea that, that people have with porn that those people were being exploited. That's the weird thing saying like, you really shouldn't have videos of you fucking on online like that, that like doing that for a living, the only people that are doing it are being exploited. But that gets down to a really weird personal freedom issue because there's some people that actually want to do that. So who's to say, and it's a weird one because if people like watching it and people want to do it, like what's wrong with it? Like what exactly is wrong? What's, what is what is really wrong? If people want to have sex but nobody wants other people to watch what's real, what does that really about?

Speaker 3:          00:06:45       Yeah, I mean, people do want to do it. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:06:49       yeah, yeah. Well, it's, it's all, it's weird when you tell someone what they can and can't do. It's weird because then it gets to like, hmm, why can't you make a porn? Why can't you like, what is wrong with watching people? Fuck, is there a, is it a, is it dangerous? Like what's going on and people getting harmed? Why? How come everyone's watching it? How come billions and billions of people are watching it, but we're still pretending that somehow or another, it's like a negative forced, it seems like, it seems like it's like an integrated part of our world,

Speaker 3:          00:07:19       right? I think there's this misconception about women, you know, being forced to do what they're doing and they're not enjoying themselves, but really, uh, I don't think that's true. And also I think a lot of porn watchers are women a lot more than we think.

Speaker 1:          00:07:32       Wow. That's a strong statement. I agree with her. Yeah. I totally agree. Well, you both freaks should be together. I think, uh, I think it's probably the majority of our men, but I think more women probably watched today than I've ever before. Right. It's a strange thing. You know, the idea behind it is very strange that it's such a taboo subject for people, people that have, uh, that, you know, we're living in a sexually repressed society. Oh, for sure. Yeah. And we're uniquely, so it's uniquely so because of all of our access to information, we were still like sort of riding on the ripples of the puritans at first settled here. Like the ripples of their way of thinking as sort of a still to this day influenced like a lot of the tone and the country. It's very strange.

Speaker 3:          00:08:16       Yeah. The entire entertainment industry just sells sex because they know that it's kind of this mystique for us because we had been so sexually repressed for so long. I mean, compared to other countries, I guess Europe, it's so fucking different. I mean, I was watching Braveheart on TV and they blurt out people's acids when they're moving the camera, but then they show people's heads being like beat up against the rock. So it's like, why are we able to see someone's brain being smashed in but we can't see an ass.

Speaker 1:          00:08:41       Yeah. It's very weird. It's weird how, you know, you could have just incredible violence in a movie and that's fine. But it's the sex, we draw the line, we draw a really distinct wine. Do you remember if there was a movie a while back called, I think it was called Brown bunny. It was Vincent Gallo and him and Chloe. So you know, that girl actually had a sex scene in the film. He can't play it because it's, don't even try to play it Brian. Cause it's actually sex. They, they uh, they, she actually gave him oral sex. Yeah. And it was like, and people got mad at him. They were like furious that they put that in the film. Like I remember reading this like really angry review by this guy and he was actually angry at Gallo for doing this and making him watch this scene, this lewd act. But it's, it's a fucking weird thing where we have, where it's like, as a society, like that is the line. You do that behind closed doors.

Speaker 1:          00:09:46       You can, you make out in a movie, you can fake fuck, but no real fucking, the weirdest thing to me is the softcore porn. Yeah. That's fucking great. How weird would it be this to be a soft core porn actor? I had a friend who did that did, I had a friend that did that and uh, him and his girl were like taken it bed and you know, they're, they're doing the scene together and they're doing it for awhile. And uh, in the middle of it she goes, you can fuck me if you really want to. And he goes, Nah, that's okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:16       So he's just the guy to get paid way more. If it was, I don't know what his motivation was, suspect didn't want it's cocked to be seen, but the, um, you know, the idea behind it. So it's a very weird thing. We were just like watching people have sex. Yeah. But it's taboo. Right. Billion dollar business. Right. But it didn't. Not really. It's like, it seems like the business has been unfairly ignored as far as like the economic impact of the industry or on the Internet on the industry. Because if you look at the economic impact of like on the music industry it's really substantial illegal downloads. Like really it was, it became a huge issue. Right. But with pornography, like no one talks about it. No one cares who pays for porn. Exactly. There's still websites where you know, people would make money and there's, there's so many people out there.

Speaker 1:          00:11:06       All the guy has to do is get fixated on one girl and she, you know, she just sticks still those inside of her all week and she's making bank. But the reality is it's like the, the actual like buying of the DVDs, just like a big thing for them and all that went away and now they get like paper view from like hotels and stuff. But I'm sure that must be diminished by the Internet as well since there's so many other options. I don't know. It's, it's illegitimate and it's like treat it as illegitimate. It's weird because it's, it's unclear. It's clearly a gigantic economic force, like the need to beat off, like it's gigantic, but yet it's ignored as far as like, you know, like if banks can fail, you know, we have to prop them up. If General Motors is going under, we have to save them.

Speaker 1:          00:11:49       We're saving jobs. But if porn starts to go on there, everybody's like, man, but it was so inflated. It was so inflated to begin with. Really the porn industry, people were getting paid ridiculous amounts of money for just, you know, like 10 minutes sex scenes. What's wrong with that? I don't think that's a bad thing. I think, um, it's, it's what the market allowed. I mean though they were very valuable then, but the digital aspect of their creations, I sort of ones and Zeros, it could be replicated at, you know, for as long as they want. That's where things get weird because once you have that, it's like, oh, well I don't have to make a copy of it. So it's not like an actual DVD. Like you could just download it and you can get it in seconds. That must have just crippled the business cause you used to have to go buy a physical DVD and if you wanted porn that's how you got your porn.

Speaker 1:          00:12:40       Those like for the longest time there was a store that I was to go to in Santa Monica. It was this um, video store. It was like half porn. It was like they had a couple of fucking like Braveheart or some shit. Like yeah, here's Matt back. Stupid. The most of it was porn. This is like in the early nineties and did you just be a bunch of dudes walking around? They're shifty, not breathing too heavy, trying to get out of there as quick as they could. And then the rest of it was like a fucking ghost town because nobody wants to go to the one video store. That's mostly best is when they have the rooms there. It's like, do you really want to support and starting to jerk off? For some people they have nowhere else to go. For some people they have nowhere else to go.

Speaker 1:          00:13:20       Also for some people they get their freak on and doing something that's forbidden in some weird CD way. Like there's something about going to a peep booth. It just excites people. My friend and my, I had a friend who used to smoke crack and go to a Pete booth. That was his thing. He would uh, he lived in New York, he was a pool hustler and one of his fun things to do would be a smoke crack and go to peep booths. So what does it peak like? We just get like a glimpse of someone dance. It's either one of two things, I guess. Some of them are like videos. You can go and get to watch videos and they would like watch videos and beat off. And then the other ones are like actual people. Like people would be be like behind glass and you know, you would talk to them like you, you walk in and they're sitting down behind like a plexiglass thing and then they do things for you.

Speaker 1:          00:14:04       Me and Eddie F went to that one place in San Francisco and that's where I, it was my first time where I touched the walls and it was wet and, oh, Jesus son. Yeah. Oh yeah. It's dark in there. You see the walls? Yeah. They got beads and shit that you have to walk through. It's fucking weird. The whole idea is weird that you're allowed to masturbate there though. I start telling you that. Right? They don't, they can't really say that that's what happens. It's like one of those things where they know you're going to beat off, but they can't say, hey, come on in and beat off. Because then it becomes like a public health issue. I think. Like people just shooting fluids all over the place. Yeah. It's like, and not only that, they don't just don't want to let you know that you can do that.

Speaker 1:          00:14:45       Just so just, just to keep whatever, you know, like to keep people from taking it to the next level. Because if you tell people that they can do it, then people, you know, they'll like, well how come I can't sell it? You know, they get, you know what I mean? Like nobody's like happy with the status quo. They always want to continue to push it. So if you tell people they can beat off in there, they're just probably going to be about fucking each other and they're probably going to go crazy. They're going to do, they want to get to want to have sex there and then we tell them that's okay, then they're going to want to kill people

Speaker 4:          00:15:13       that decline them. Porn at least has raised the quality of the prostitute though. So we should just, you know, think about that for a second. Well that's another weird thing.

Speaker 1:          00:15:23       An article where a girl who was a, uh, it was a really very smart article about a girl who used to be a porn star and then became a prostitute. And she was saying that it's just, there's not much difference between being on the set and being in a brothel. You know, that it's just like, there's no cameras where, you know, just you're just having sex and sometimes you don't want to have sex with that person. You just do it because that's your job. And I was like, wow, it's weird that we like, that's a, that's a real issue. Like you, you like, you tell someone that someone's a prostitute and that person's like, oh my goodness,

Speaker 4:          00:15:54       you go there. There's that website that lacks illegal. I mean, yeah, that, that luxury companion website. Have you ever heard of that? No. What's that? Hi Claudi prostitute website. But the sad thing is, is if you go through it, it's all porn stars. Like you're all like, man, I actually have sex with her.

Speaker 1:          00:16:10       That's crazy. Well that's a sweet deal if you're a fan. Yeah. It's not like, you know, you could for $10,000 or $20,000 can go play basketball with Michael Jordan. And I was like, Bitch, I'm busy. But if you're a fan of one of those gals finger, the task had to be really weird to be a dude is like super obsessed for the girl. Wow. What a crazy chance. It's one thing to meet strangers, but to meet strangers who are sexually obsessed with you and get to have sex with you for money. Like that's a strange energy exchange right there. That's some high level shit

Speaker 4:          00:16:42       should do that too. Like my room late John, why are we doing? And we're like the shy ones like oh no

Speaker 1:          00:16:49       men. Yeah, well it's, it's looked down upon in bolts. As soon as is involved it's like money and sex for some reason did not. Anytime it's connected, whether it's a Gigolo or whether it's a girl, prostitutes like terrible. It's awful. Like you're connecting money and sex money and everything else was cool. You know, money

Speaker 4:          00:17:07       dictation, sex to sell everything. Yeah. Did you hear, did you guys hear about that dude who killed a prostitute and use the self defense thing and he got off because she stole money from him and she didn't, she didn't actually fuck him. So then he was able to get off on self defense in some weird fucked up lawn. It was like one of those stand your ground things except I was like, you stole my money and didn't deliver the goods so I can kill you. Oh my God. Wait a minute. What's David? I want to say Texas, but I don't, what's the story? How long ago was this story? Just say, dude kills prostitute. Oh my God. Gets articles are going to get probably more more hits on Google. Then baseball bat in the ass. Guy Kills Prostitute

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       or baseball bat in the end gets off. I went to, I went to look once just as, because I didn't believe it was true. Someone told me that there was a video of a young girl with a baseball bat in their rump and I went for the Google. But when, when you go for the Google search, the numbers are insane. I'm going to, I'm going to do it. We'll see what the, a recent one is. Baseball Bat and ass data. Drm on our friend Dana. She's a sweetie. Um, let's see how many hits. Okay, you ready for this? Yeah. 5 million. 900,000 results. Oh Geez. Wow. Okay, whoa. Knocking. Choose images because the first photo that comes up is the worst Croesus image I've seen. Oh Dude. Jesus. What the fuck is that? What is that? Someone being rude, being rude. I don't know. Let's say it's not, let's hope it's not.

Speaker 2:          00:18:47       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:18:48       Yikes. Yeah. Whoops. And then it's like Todd's a rigid stuck in this Abby, you fall or something immediately looking at bedtime back in the ass because of her painting when we started talking about porn. Oh yeah, yeah, that's right. It's your fault when you still look. That was a playboy playboy from the, like the 70s and sixties. Women look pretty good today. No, I just like everybody's good natural boots. Yeah. Um, more voluptuous. I think they're going to have within our lifetimes a different work around for that and it'll be a biological work around, they'll, they'll have something where you can actually grow a breast, your, your breasts or grow larger. I really think that's going to happen. Yeah. I think there's going to be all sorts of weird genetic changes over the next few decades. The stuff that they're working on right now. [inaudible] I talked to Ray Kurzweil, he told me that they're working on artificial blood cells that allow you to hold your breath under water for four hours.

Speaker 2:          00:19:42       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:19:43       sweet. So you could just hop in a water, hop in a tank of water, ankle.

Speaker 1:          00:19:47       And because of these artificial blood cells are so efficient that you would have enough oxygen. We, you'd hold your breath for four hours. That's like, he thinks within our lifetime. That's awesome. That's a mind blowing fucking, yeah. Yeah. So I think like boobs, it's going to be an easy one. Yeah. That's going to be easy. They're just going to give you the boob bug. You know, it's like a, like a version of the flu. You get sick and your tit scroll like monsters. That's what's going to happen. They're probably going to be no ugly people in a hundred years. Everyone's going to be super engineered, genetic looking doctor Manhattan men, and uh, every woman's going to be like the perfect sexpot. They're gonna, they're gonna have that down. There's going to be no like, why would you do, why would you have bad teeth when you could just brush? You know, it's going to be like that simple, right? Like, did you go to the Jane Place? What do you want to like trust, random chance. And what your body's like, are you fucking crazy? You want to trust random chance. I'm one of the most important things is far as like social currency. We all agree that like beautiful people have like this amazing power. They have an amazing power to get people's, they have

Speaker 5:          00:20:48       like you meet at like a big tall, handsome man with a perfect face and you just, you just go, wow, he's here. Right? You know, it's, it's totally metro. It's a complete natural thing for human beings to do, but it's fucking weird. It's a lottery. And how much would that fuck up with a social order though, if everyone knows can throw it into the toilet, it's going to be a goddamn mess. We're going to not, it's like how we bill are lazy because we don't have to go chase quail to eat. He just go to fucking Jack in the box and get a chicken sandwich is fucking easy. You'd take it takes three minutes and it's already cooked. You know, you give him some paper and you're done with it, but I think that it's going to be much along the same line. It's like we're lazy in that it doesn't take much to get us fed.

Speaker 5:          00:21:30       So most people just sort of skate by in life. There's no like real desperation of fear of not feeding in this country. At least, you know, for some people it's a struggle, but one day it's going to get to the point where that's the way it is with everything it's going to be. That's the way it is with your looks, you're going to be able to just look like whatever you want. There's going to be people that don't even look like people. People are definitely going to want to look like dinosaurs. Well, people that are like furries and shit like that. If they could like genetically altered humans to be like a dinosaur type person and change your body and then you have to eat goats and shit, kill 'em with your face, people would sign up. Yeah, no doubt. Right.

Speaker 3:          00:22:08       I'd probably be a huge counterculture of does dinosaur Tucker's. Yes, but I always thought it would be so interesting like a thousand years from now if the, you know, if we died off and then people in the future came back and dissected our skeletons and found remnants of like silicon and they're like, what the fuck? Where people just like inserting silicon packets and their body and an APP implants, you know that that exists now. I can't imagine I have one of those just getting like a shield just underneath your skin cause you're like, ah, I don't want to fucking try to do crunch.

Speaker 5:          00:22:39       Well I think it's a surgery. Um, I might be wrong, but I think what the APP thing is, is they sort of like suture it in to create permanent six pack indentations. So it's like, just like I'm talking shit, I've watched a special on it, but it was barely paying attention because I was like, do some crunches. You Lazy Bitch. Should I change the channel? I was like, that's so ridiculous. Fake Abs, right? Dudes get fake calves have implants. Yeah. Yeah. If you have skinny calves, I guess.

Speaker 3:          00:23:07       I think I look at a man, I'm like 30 doesn't have big enough calves.

Speaker 5:          00:23:10       Well what happens? I think with uh, the bodybuilder type gentlemen is the same thing that happens to anorexics. I think it's been pretty much proven is that they have a distorted opinion of how they look. If some of those big bodybuilder dudes, they don't, they don't like, they won't expose their body. They cover it up. They have like blankets and shit. They were everywhere and they were like four or five sweaters. Like it's weird, like they don't show their body, they feel small. They were a lot of layers sometimes. And some of these guys are fucking mountains, like human mountains, but they're wearing like two sweatshirts and a tee shirt over that. And you know, it's almost like they want to like, yeah, it's gay. They get crazy. Some of them can get, and it's not all of them obviously, but you can get crazy. And so they look at their calves and look, fuck deuce.

Speaker 4:          00:23:54       We should have a little cough. And then just stuff, some shoe horns in there, pop them bitches out. I mean, I don't know who the first guy was. It went for it. It was like, I'm fucking tired of my fucking bullshit. Like MTV special on it like 10 years ago, this little like fucking squarely kid on the beach. And then after it he's like, everyone's looking at my calves. It's like, yeah, cause they look fucking huge compared to the rest of your body. Why is so have you seen this is donating. People are getting donuts putting their their head. Oh, I've seen that. It's céline what it is. Is it a weight? Yeah. That's why they do it. It's um, they pump of, they actually inject saline into their forehead and they like put like a little indentation with her finger sticks. People are so strange. Some woman who was this beautiful model and Korea and then she got, she doesn't like her face with a bunch of olive oil and ships couldn't, they would not give her any more plastic surgery. Now she looks insane. Yeah. It was cooking oil. She was awful. Injecting cooking oil interface. Poor girl. I know.

Speaker 5:          00:24:58       Yeah. The, the human mind is so fucking complex. It's so strange because it's like, it seems like most of your life is almost like a balancing act. It's a balancing act of happiness and friendships and laughter and accomplishments and not losing your mind along the way. But for a lot of folks, somewhere in that dance is just too much and they just go towards lose your mind at full steam ahead and then you're sticking needles and cooking oil in their face or we've all seen the, the one actress that it will not stop fucking with her face until they become like almost like hideous or, or, or pitiful. You know when you look at them you have pity like, oh no, what did she do this thing to her face. It's a very strange, strange aspect of, of the human beings had every now and then you'd take what looks like a totally normal person. He's like keeping it together for a long time. And then one day,

Speaker 4:          00:25:55       yeah I'll have to crazy town. Fuck again. Tick Kiva together anymore. I give up, I'm just fucking running. And it's so fucking obvious too when they, they overdo the plastic surgery cause everyone just start, it looks exactly like it's fucking,

Speaker 5:          00:26:07       well it's, it's, you know what it is. You get delusional and you think it's going to fix. I had hair transplants and I had my first one, I think when I was like 26 I had three of them. Why, why is still young? Just cause, cause like my hair was falling out. I was fucking freaking out. I was freaking out when my hair was falling out because I was on TV too and I was making a living like as an actor at the time on news radio. And I was like, oh my God, my fucking hair is falling out. I had new one, it was falling out for a while. I saved it though with the Minoxidil. Minoxidil was hanging in there. But after a while it was like, it was still falling out. And I was like, God, I got to do something about it.

Speaker 5:          00:26:40       I should have never done anything. I should have shaved my head from the beginning. And so when ever kids ask me online like dude's ask me, Oh fuck fucker, frequent, oh Moyer and lose my hair, shave it, bitch. Just deal with that. Just just accept the fact you don't have any hair looked bad. It didn't look good Mike. I never looked at my heroine. It was always like, like, oh I guess I got hair up there now, whatever. But you know the way they do it as like a single thing, it's not like the old way of doing it, but they take it big strip of hair. So I have this like big scar in the back of my head, like a smile for the rest of my life. But I'd rather have that like first of all it's a good public service announcement. Like if you thinking about doing this, just look at my head, don't do it.

Speaker 5:          00:27:21       Just shave your head. And then the other thing is that it, it's, it's almost like what you're doing is it's a screw ball thing. Like it seems like it might work a little, but then as you start doing it, go why Wayne but isn't their options? Is there another route that, and the other option is just let it be what the fuck it is and stop freaking out. That's the other option. There's always the best option rather than getting knocked unconscious and they take a chunk of meat out of the back of your head and drill fucking holes in there and implant those. It's nuts. Oh yeah. Jason, what's his

Speaker 6:          00:27:52       name's Jason. Alex. Jason Alexander, I think. Yeah, he wanted to go back in time just like yours. So it kind of looked like he was about to go bald. See why would just make it more realistic.

Speaker 5:          00:28:02       Wow. Yeah, he got 'em. He got like a super cool hairpiece I guess. Yeah, it's kind of weird because like it would chick wears a wig. It's like, you know, no biggie. You know, like, like when Madonna would wear wigs or when lady Gaga, I would wear some crazy wigs. Like nobody tripped. But if a dude's wearing a wig,

Speaker 6:          00:28:23       well is that really a little too far? Too Far? That's beautiful. It's real. I would love it if he did that. If he gave up on

Speaker 5:          00:28:32       dying his hair, like if imagine if he was all white like that for real. So he gives up on dying his hair and then he just has a crazy white hair piece goes for it. And like, I would actually really sorcerer. Totally respect that. Like a sorcerer. Michael Bolt. Yeah. Hey whatever man. That's what the dude wants to look like. But for me, I can tell you that it was a big mistake on my part and it was one that I made and getting hair transplants out of insecurity because I was young and I was, you know, thinking like, oh, I'm not going to have a career. I'm going to be a bald loser. You know, like that's what I was thinking. That's a society drills into us. And if you, and if you want to have a solution to something, you go research it. And at the time it's very little internet too, so it wasn't as easy to research things.

Speaker 5:          00:29:12       But you know, you talk, do you find like a doctor who does it and you talk to them and they show you photos and you're like, oh, this is going to work. Oh boy, I'm going to fix my hair. And then the next thing you know, what am I doing this stupid fuck. And I guarantee you probably most women that one of doing something wrong, whether it's a lip thing or a nose thing where they're like, oh Christ. And they look at it in the mirror and they're like, what the fuck did I just do? And then you could try to fix it. Like I've heard of girls that have had girls Gore all where that came from corals than I've had too many nose jobs and they have to get like cartilage removed from, from the rib, and then they recreate the nose. Yeah. I talked to this guy that told me about this operation that they had to do that is, she was in her 20s to, she'd had too many nose jobs already and she'd ruined her nose and her nose like Jackson, dude. I mean, I know he's a, yeah. Yeah. This girl had like, well her nose apparently like started to like go in after the bone and like it's kind of sunk in because there wasn't any cartilage there to support the rest of the nose.

Speaker 3:          00:30:14       Ooh,

Speaker 5:          00:30:15       Ooh. Yeah. It's weird man. It's weird. Some people just have bigger noses and they just got to deal with that. It's our righty. It's going to be okay. You know,

Speaker 3:          00:30:24       I saw Michael Jackson impersonator on Hollywood and vine last night with like a little kid in a candy shop. I was like, this is a ridiculous moment in time whose kid is I also got robbed. You got wrong. What happened? I got like bum rushed by but like a crowd and then they just must have lifted my wallet right out of my purse. It was crazy.

Speaker 5:          00:30:45       So they just ran into you and bumped into your bag and you didn't notice it? Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:30:49       and I was like, how the fuck am I going to fly? Apparently you don't need an ID to fly. You just need to go. There were like, we need to put you through like 20 security tests. They'll come to the airport two hours early. I was like, God dammit. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:31:01       Have you ever had that happen before where you get like roughly frisky?

Speaker 3:          00:31:05       No, but I have, uh, gotten yelled at by a TSA agent because I didn't want to go through the body scanner and he was like, what do you, his celebrity? He's like, only celebrities don't want to go through the body scanner. And I was like, why are you, I was like, this is crazy that you're talking to me like this. Like, what the fuck? This is nuts. It's an option, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. He was just like totally demeaning. Mean I can in front of everyone and nuts. Why would celebrities not want to go through the new ones? Like, it's like, yeah. Why would you want to get molested? I mean,

Speaker 5:          00:31:35       well, it's, I've never had it happen to me. Everyone has always been pleasant with me. But, uh, Graham Hancock, uh, who's been on the podcast several times, he's a good friend. He went through one and he said this dude like just was aggressively sexual with him, like grabbing his, his body. Like it felt like he was being molested. Like, I shouldn't say aggressively sexual, but he grabbed his cock and the whole thing. I mean, like he said, it felt like he was getting raped, like obviously not as extreme, but you know, it's, it's like a form of a violation. And he was really shocked by it and he wrote about it. He was shocked enough that he didn't just let it go. He sat down and wrote some stuff. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:32:11       Well there's this report that came out that said that there's so many more cases of malfeasance and misconduct and the Tsa than any other government. I mean, this is like 20 times more. And so there was this investigation done to find out, well, why is there so much fucking like crimes happening? Like robbery, um, sexual abuse and stuff. And it was, and basically this representative figured out that they don't really do background checks. Oh my God. And they're just kind of skipping through this huge, uh, you know, you think that you would, so basically they're hiring, uh, pedophiles and child molesters. What they found out. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:32:43       No. Well, yes. Well not nice people too. Sure. We should say that. I met a lot of really nice people to Tsa and people. You fucking government chill, relax. No, I'm just saying I'm just trying to, in the interest of fairness, I know some of them are just folks that needed a job and that's just the reality of the situation. Graham Hancock got molested. He'd do a little bit, what are you going on? It's a thing where I think that it, it can be pretty well argued that there needs to be some form of security, but it's also a thing that is much like many other public service jobs is that it should be really respected and it should be something you're paid well for. It should be a difficult job to acquire. And I think it's a matter of priorities and if we shifted those priorities that we could make a sizable change in the way the whole thing is run. If you made it so that people were, first of all, it's made, it made it so that those, those jobs are a little bit more difficult to come by. And that the people that do do a Dubai get background checks and it's a really good job to get with excellent benefits so they don't feel left out of fucked or disenfranchised. It's, it's something that's worth, and then so also worth adhering to a certain code of conduct because it's a really good job, you know, I think when you have a John, but it's, you know,

Speaker 3:          00:33:54       yeah, get a frown. Just getting paid like fucking minimum wage. I think we're a little more polished. I think it's a use useless agency.

Speaker 5:          00:34:01       Well, how do you think that you should do security

Speaker 3:          00:34:03       did before nine 11 how did that day was totally created in the wake of nine 11 it's a total, the new government agencies like the Department of Homeland Security and just, I mean, think about it, the hijackers brought on what knives, like you can still bring those in. This guy, Jonathan Corbet basically expose the fact that you can just create an insulin pocket and bringing to whatever the fuck you want through these body scanners. So they really have like a huge security breach. So, but when you go back to why the body scans were implemented like an in sown pocket that's like silver or something. Oh, so it has to be a sign. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And you can carry anything through. Oh Wow. Yeah. But I mean, the reason that the body scanners were implemented in the first place, he says Michael, Michael Chertoff was, uh, tied up with rape rapist scan, which is also the name of the body scanner. Right. Rapiscan rapid rapid scan, but I call him, right.

Speaker 7:          00:34:52       [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          00:34:59       well it wasn't, I got a patent, so Rapiscan I've got a patent, I'm not changing the fucking name because it adamant, some crazy multimillionaire guy who just was nuts. So yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:35:10       sky was, I was running the DHS and he, uh, he was tied up with the lobbying firm and profiting off these body scanners. And so they just put them in all the airports and they don't even really work. Even Israel, the Israeli government was like, we're not going to use those because they don't work like they're not going to stop terrorism. So they're totally pointless. Uh, it's just like a money making scam.

Speaker 5:          00:35:30       Wow. Yeah. Well, but here's the question. Before nine 11, they did something right that you went to reddit radar detectors.

Speaker 4:          00:35:38       You went through just the regular metal detectors. Right. And they still, they x rayed your luggage. No, I don't know. I think they did. Yeah. I feel like they did. Didn't they seemed like they did, but yeah, they did.

Speaker 1:          00:35:50       Um, between then and now it's just gotten more complicated. Is that what the idea is?

Speaker 3:          00:35:57       Well, they just, you know, they want to dehumanize us as much as possible to make flying the worst fucking thing in the world is, and now I get to take off your shoes. The liquid thing is completely absurd. That was based on something that was totally, it wasn't fake, but it was like these mentally unstable people who we're trying to mix liquid explosives that it wasn't even going to work. It was like totally pointless. They weren't even able to do it. So then they just punish everyone by making everyone put little liquids in bags and it's just ridic.

Speaker 1:          00:36:24       Maybe they found like proof of concept after that that like yeah, somebody could go on,

Speaker 4:          00:36:29       someone could ship who bottle full with c four that looks like conditioner. You can't bring snow gloves on. Snow Globes. I just saw that in a little shake. Like a paperweight. I didn't. I was there a snowglobe terrorist that I miss. Like someone trying to listen to. Someone was coming at me and they were trying to get

Speaker 1:          00:36:46       crazy. I could fuck you up with a snow globe. So imagine a pitcher, a really good baseball pitcher and a snow globe. Oh my God, you're a dead man. It's going to kill you with that thing. It can be used as a weapon,

Speaker 4:          00:36:56       but now the TSA is actually taking it so fucking farm. And they, I just saw this video where this woman comes back from her trip, she gets her car and there's a little note in her car that says Tsa inspected your car while you were gone. She was like, what?

Speaker 1:          00:37:09       Apparently it's a local jurisdiction, a thing they can the, the local, uh, it's not a TSA thing. It's a local security for the parking lot. And the TSA, yeah, in various districts I think has very different ways of approaching these types of situations. But if they choose to, for some reason I think it was like a valet car. She valued her car and for whatever reason they chose to see search it. But I don't think what they're saying is this not a TSA policy? I think that was the, the um, um, the, the response to it, but it wasn't TSA policy that it was a local thing and someone did. So it's not something they plan on doing, but it could have been something they were like testing the waters and then people freak

Speaker 4:          00:37:49       cow and then they're like, [inaudible] we have a sign up. And she's like, that sign wasn't here before. It's like we're going to really inspect your car. Yeah. Oh Wow. Well, I want to know who to believe their, that gets weird. I wish I knew, but still, even if there is a sign, if you're not told, hey, we're going to search your car. I mean, it'd be real specific about, can't just have a sign. Oh, I might look through your shit. You're like, are you didn't read everything in this entire office before you gave the Valet Dude your keys. I'll might steal your change. Sorry. I will have to sign. Just so, I mean, it's, it's grown so much. It's such a waste of money. I just think, I mean, what, what have we done really with the Tsa? Well, the, the argument

Speaker 1:          00:38:32       I would say, um, I don't disagree with you, but argument, I would say

Speaker 5:          00:38:35       if I was, you know, doing the counterpoint was like, think of how many lives we've saved. Think how many terrorist attacks were stopped. Thinking how many people did not try things because they thought they would never get through the infinite matrix. That is the TSA line of integrity in you're right then you're right, it is hypothetical's but a certain point in time, you know, is it hypothetical that if you didn't have vitamin C you would get scurvy? See where I'm going with this? I'm not going anywhere folks, blacks, I don't believe a word I'm saying. Um, I hear you. I know what you're saying, but I think that there should probably be some form of security just with the reality of the world that we live in. I don't fucking trust people that much. I don't trust people to, I just feel like if there was no security at all, I would have to like have a lot more faith in our society.

Speaker 5:          00:39:26       Go back to what it was before. It was totally fine. What is it before though? Do you know the specifics? I don't know if it was like, it wasn't a private contractor. I mean, I think it was government agents, but it was just very, uh, it wasn't like a huge multibillion dollar wasteful agency that is just like, is it this one of those things where, and I'm obviously not a politician, nor do I really even understand politics, but is it one of those things where when jobs get created and a business gets created, it behooves them to enhance that business and spread that business and make that business larger. Whether that business is Chick-Filet or their businesses, the TSA, once it's an actual business, so it's not a government agency. Oh, it's a business. It's a private business. That's where things are always going to get weird because as soon as you can profit and like it's not just the state profits.

Speaker 5:          00:40:16       No, no, no individuals profit and they have motivation. And then they also can have things called lobbyists and they could spend a shitload of money to try to get laws pushed by that make their business more profitable and make more what? That's crazy. That's where it gets crazy. You can't differentiate anymore between the corporatist and the actual government employees. So it's hard to tell. It's like, it sounds like you're calling for socialism now. You fucks without me. That's what I'm hearing. I'm hearing a bunch of fucking anticapitalist nonsense. Why? If it wasn't for capitalism, which is so true. If it wasn't for capitals and we wouldn't have shit, you know, communism doesn't work. You can't get people to work unless you give them a reward. If you want cool shit, you want a Samsung phone, you want to be able to watch TV on a big screen, it's flat.

Speaker 5:          00:41:02       You get it. Someone's going to make that, okay, you're not going to do it, and the capitalism is the only way that shit gets done. If the whole world is communists and socialists, that stuff doesn't probably get made. Why are, those are only two options though. My question because I think there's a lot of flaws and capitalism. You're so right. You know what we need, I think is some sort of moralism. Capitalism in a, not just not capitalism, not communism, but moralism, ethical ism, and it's something where it's just like, John, can we figure this out? It seems like this cannot be worked out. Like we don't have to like live

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       like one person has to die, so that all may live like it's 2000 and fucking 13 or any people

Speaker 3:          00:41:39       kills me. Like I get this, I see the potential that we have and we're just fucking squandering it. Yeah. It's like what the fuck? We know that we can have clean energy, we know that we can have this, we know that we can live compatibly and harmoniously like with the earth, but we're just fucking raping, pillaging shit. I mean I think, I think it's a flaw in capitalism to see what happens. Monopolies form and then it buys out governments. And

Speaker 1:          00:42:00       you said a flaw though, or is it almost like a built in mechanism designed to encourage movement? It's all, it's almost like the, the way that things really get done, but you need some incredibly greedy fucks if this is the trend

Speaker 3:          00:42:14       that's designed within capitalism than isn't that fucked?

Speaker 1:          00:42:16       Yes, it's definitely fucked. But the question is, is it this way because this is the most efficient way to move this thing forward. This is the most efficient way to continue to produce new technological innovations, to continue to push our ability to access information, whether it's like willingly given up through the internet or whether they're watching your cell phones like that. All of it is kind of connected.

Speaker 3:          00:42:41       Well, it's interesting because we hear a lot, you know, um, you need reward, you need value, you need people competing and that otherwise you won't have innovation and you won't have these new technologies. But I look at it, you know, we had innovations 20 years ago that cars can run on water, but the car industry bought out and pat this patent and this, you see this across the board. So we actually see an, uh, technology is being stifled because of the capitalist model that we live in, this vulture capitalism where they're monopolizing all these industries and preventing technology from a rising.

Speaker 1:          00:43:11       So that water car thing is totally true. No. Yeah. Yeah. I had heard in the electric car, remember who killed the electric car. Yes, I heard about the water thing on Opie and Anthony. Uh, they were talking about how the guy who created it died of a heart attack and he was, he had a meeting with two men and he ran the restaurant screaming. They poisoned me and then die of a heart attack. Yes. Yeah. See if you guys can see if you can find that story. Cause a stoping Anthony were talking about it. It sounded like a fucking scene in a movie. Like the guy he like yelled, they poisoned me and ran out and had a heart attack or a stroke. I can't remember my memory's shit. Uh, but it's um, my memory is actually excellent for our human, but there's just too much to remember. Yeah, that's true.

Speaker 3:          00:43:56       I don't know. We can reinvent the wheel here. I think that we can advance humanity in our collective consciousness to a point where we can like figure out a different way instead of reverting back to these old paradigms of like communism or capitalism and the way that we know, I mean, can't we recreate something? We, we know what exists. We have the ability to intercommunicate within the entire planet. The technology's growing exponentially. I just think that we can do better than what we've seen.

Speaker 1:          00:44:24       I think you're totally right. I think we need to learn as human beings, we need to learn how to manage our humanity and there's

Speaker 5:          00:44:32       a lot of things that we're going to have to take into consideration when you start talking about that kind of stuff. And one of them is that people have a desire for competition. They just do. They always have and that has to be quelled in some form. Whether you should take up a game that you enjoy or get involved in sports or in court. Martial arts are a good example or some form of discipline that allows you to like blow off energy and blow off this competitive design that you have inside of you that sort of as allowed human beings to get to this point in the first place. I mean we didn't survive for tens of thousands of years because we weren't intent on survival at all costs. And one of that, one of the costs is competition. It's a part of what what's made us a human being.

Speaker 5:          00:45:18       It's a part of why we're here. And I think that when people get involved in anything, whether it's a corporate thing or whether it's uh, uh, competition and uh, a game or a team, there's this desire to do better than those you're competing against. Like if you talk to people that are business people and they'll talk about their competitors were fucking kicking it right down their throat, they're, they're like very aggressive about shit. When you get guys alone they start talking about how well they're doing against the competition. Yeah. They closed down through their stores and like they start getting like real excited about conquering shit and it's, it's, it's that mimicked that this, this genetic thing. I think that's like almost been incorporated into our, our DNA because it's been so responsible for getting people to this point. Like you have to crack eggs in order to make an Omelet. There had to be a bunch of crazy shit to get us to rise from apes with sticks to driving a car and to do it all so fast it, there had to be a lot of chaos involved in doing that. But we should be able to recognize that now

Speaker 8:          00:46:21       and go, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, whoa,

Speaker 5:          00:46:24       okay, everybody catch your breath. It took us a long fucking time to get here, but let's look at why we got here. This is what, this was what motivated us. You see all this. We just wanted to breed, want to make sure we have children and make sure that we stopped the barbarian hordes from coming over from the next town over. If we can just all agreed to not be fuckheads. None of that's going to happen. We can all talk now. Okay. This isn't like you speak German and I don't understand Dutch and he's Chinese. No, no, no, no, no, no. Everybody pretty knows what the fuck. Pretty much knows what the fuck everybody else is saying, so everybody just chill. That's all she can. We agree to chill. Okay, let's choose your own thing. Let's figure out this fucking resource thing. There's a natural resource thing that it seems like as all of ours.

Speaker 5:          00:47:03       Okay. Why don't other people get to keep that and how come the people that get to keep that keep wanting to go to war and controls you? Let's, you know, I know it sounds a little radical, but maybe you guys are kind of being consumed by controlling all the oil, isn't it? The Earth's yeah. You suck in and out of holes in the ground. Like what? It's fucking fascinating that we're just wasting all of this magical resource that's takes billions of years to compound in the earth that were just blowing it. Fucking killed. It makes for awesome cars

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       does, but we don't save it. Yeah. It's a stupid thing I've said before that I think

Speaker 5:          00:47:36       they're going to do is eventually come up with some sort of a, a bacteria that eats carbon dioxide in the air and they're going to release it like a moth, like a colony of Moss in the air. It's going to chew through all the pollution, but then it's gonna meet tails. Yeah, but that's going to mutate to bring up cam. Charles, please, please don't bring up chem trails. Kim Cherrelle believers. I love Ya. I feel Ya. I used to, I probably could have been one of you. Okay. But I read a couple of articles along the way. Just don't, I'm not a fucking Geo engineer and I'm not a new world order person either. Right. The illuminati stop.

Speaker 4:          00:48:11       Well I just haven't met one. I haven't seen one pilot who's, I mean if they were spraying chemicals on us and the government was doing this around the world every day, don't you think that some pilot would have come out and said like, I don't know, Yo, you know, who knows, why would he sprays on family, you know, and like it's very nonspecific way to poison the world already getting enough poison. I don't, but it has been done. Did the, the thing about

Speaker 5:          00:48:36       yeah. Dropping stuff from plains has been done and in fact there was a recent article that was uh, it was just published about a, these tests that they did I want to say, oh shoot, I should look it up. But um, it was uh, there were spraying radioactive waste from, from playing.

Speaker 4:          00:48:51       Yeah, the monitor crazy shit. Engineering experiments and then the cloud seeding and said, there is like geoengineering happening and it works, but it's not

Speaker 5:          00:49:02       to the extent of what people look, it's always they like, I know I was just about to say, yeah, they gave the the Tuskegee experiment, they gave those guys syphilis or allowed them to have syphilis and not treat them. This is all like that. They thing is a real problem because it's not, they're not all part of the same group. It's people that are cunts. That's what it is, is assholes that have done something wrong and w w if they're in a position of government, it's always they, it's like they have

Speaker 4:          00:49:27       done that. Yeah. If someone just asked me last night, they said, do you know, do you believe in the new world order or the Illuminati and stuff? And I said, well, I think that it's giving them too much credit and it's also taking away people's agency to be like, there's this unknowable group controlling everything behind the shadows. It's like, no, we know that these mother fuckers are, you can, they're, they're hidden in plain sight. It's the board of directors of all the most powerful corporations in the world. I mean, these are the people who are,

Speaker 5:          00:49:51       yeah. Hunting Shit. This is a fact. Okay. Then in the 1950s and this is, uh, this is often Yahoo news. This is, this is widely reported throughout the Internet, which means everything, the Internet,

Speaker 4:          00:50:03       I don't know what's true. I don't know. It's true. I'm not a researcher.

Speaker 5:          00:50:06       Yeah, yeah. We've got one there. Oh, wow. Bam. We're like, Fuck Jeanie's here. James does genie's this woman says that, um, she lost her baby when her father died. Uh, she was a baby rather when her father died and explicit inexplicably in 1955 and she watched four siblings die of cancer and she survived cervical cancer. Upon learning, the army conducted chemical tests in her impoverish St Louis and neighborhood in the height of the Cold War. She wonders if her own governments to Blaine in the mid 1950s and again, a decade later, the army used mode motorized blowers, a top low income housing and high rise at schools and from the backs of station wagons to send a potentially dangerous compound into the already hazy air in predominantly black areas of St Louis. Local officials will trope. We're told at the time that the government was testing a smokescreen that could shield Saint Louis from aerial observation in case the Russians attack.

Speaker 5:          00:51:05       Wow. But in 1994 the government said that the tests were a part of a biological weapons program and Saint Louis was chosen because it bore some resemblance to Russian cities at the u s might attack. Holy Shit. The materials being sprayed with zinc, cadmium sulfide, a fine fluorescent powder. Oh my God, that's horrible. That's so scary. There's just no accountability for any of this shit that's, that's happened. I'm sure these people got like a very little payout that they've just watched all their family die. It's so scary. It's terrible. And then here's the, here's the thing for the [inaudible] folks, this is real. This is real. And when you're looking at a lot of things that may or may not be what you think they are, it's really important to find out what is real. Right? It's really important. And if you're not sure if something is just a jet engine creating an artificial cloud because it's passing through condensation or if it's the government spraying you, if you call one or the other, it becomes a problem for all of the information.

Speaker 5:          00:52:08       Absolutely dilutes the real argument, which is the fact that there's the challenge or even just the jet fuel of just planes in general. The jet fuel thing is crazy and that's something that we figured out on the shows that 93,000 flights a day fly worldwide, 93,000 saying it's incredible. And there was a study done after nine 11 which is really fascinating. And this is kind of funny because it was in CNN, this is long before the chem trail thing, either a, it's a CNN article from 2002 uh, and it was talking about how the temperature shifted because of the fact that there was no contrails in the sky and that these contractors and it referred to them as the artificial clouds created by jet planes, that these contrail had been cooling the earth. The difference was a couple of degrees. I don't know how the fuck they can tell whether or not they're a couple of degrees.

Speaker 5:          00:53:00       Variance is just natural cause things vary all the time as far as temperature. But in this article they were trying to attribute it to the fact that there was no controls in the sky, which is fascinating. That's crazy. I think to me there's no causal connection to the heavy metals, corrosive metals found in the, in the water than it is the spraying. I mean we have no connection at all and that's like the only evidence people can keep showing me is they're just like, look at you Berrien and aluminum is found in this and the water. And I'm like, dude, we're

Speaker 4:          00:53:26       fucking polluting the whole earth. I mean water's cyclical. Like I don't, yeah, it's, well it's weird. It's w what we worry about is weird because the chem trails, if the government really was spraying something, that is something we should worry about, but stop. What are the effects? I don't feel anything. If they are really doing this on a regular basis. If they just cooling the water, what is exactly going on now let's stop and look at the shit that we're not paying attention to. We're pumping like raw sewage into the ocean. Like people going like just shitting into the ocean. There's, there's like boats that are burning diesel fuel. This other Schultz with giant nets that are killing every fucking fish within it's, you know, whatever stretched. They've got these goddamn killer net set up for just salted fish out of it, throwing plastic in there.

Speaker 4:          00:54:15       There's a gigantic garbage chat. There's one in the Great Lakes do. There's one in every Monday at fucking talking to this woman talking about plastic. And she was saying 20 years ago, this research team went out fucking hundreds of miles away from the great Pacific garbage patch and the fish that they were fishing full of plastic particles and all of a sudden this guy went down to the bottom of the ocean where they were and it was covered in plastic bags. And this was 20 years ago. Can you imagine how it is now? I mean this, this is the shit that we should be considering. Exactly. It's, it's, so this Saint Louis Story for the chem trail folks, here's one in your, in your corner. This is real. Okay. This is real. So you are right to distrust any people that could be in a position of power that could possibly profit from doing something that could harm people.

Speaker 4:          00:55:01       You're absolutely right to be paranoid about that. Um, that's, that's not what I say when, when, you know, when I talk about these things, I just think it's really important to be aware of exactly what's happening. It's the same thing with fluoride. I think Florida is horrible and it shouldn't be in drinking water. But the thing is, it's been kind of hijacked into this conspiracy theory that says like it's this mass mind control thing and trying to give everyone brain damage and Hitler used it on, on the Jews. It's that, first of all that's not true. There's no evidence to back that up. But also it's like, no, it's just a phosphate mineral byproducts that were just pouring in the water supplies. Like that's what we should be concerned about. That there's a waste product being sold to municipalities and just fucking toxifying our water.

Speaker 4:          00:55:41       But isn't the idea that people who use fluoride fluoride, what does it fluoridated? Florida doesn't sound right. Fluoridated sounds wrong. Um, fluoridated water have better teeth like that is actual health. The Ada did an extensive study, uh, about a decade ago that showed that it was just better hygiene overall that just showed that people just had better hygiene overall. And it really, there's no difference between fluoridated and non fluoridated areas. Whoa. Really, really just topically applying fluoride. Yes, that is, you know, that helps with tooth decay but ingesting it, we're already getting it when we shower, when we cook, like why are we drinking it too? It just doesn't back at the history, the idea was that the, the water having fluoride in it would

Speaker 5:          00:56:24       help with tooth decay as well as does it do anything else? No kill anything offering. It's not even Florida, it's a, it's a this thing called a hexa florists allistic acid and it's just a fucking fertilizer byproduct that they've just like, it's just this old school collusion between the fertilizer industry and the water industry is just based on like a huge propaganda campaign. It's saying that fluoride is good for your teeth and we just kind of still believe it. It's bizarre. There's so many other countries in the world. I do not do that at all. Wow. Well if you ever had like real springwater like right from a, like a Colorado, well I just had distilled water for the first time. It tastes like fucking snow. You've got to be careful. What is the deal? It doesn't have any minerals in it cause it leaches them.

Speaker 7:          00:57:07       Yeah, there's a process

Speaker 5:          00:57:09       process. I don't know. I shouldn't say it takes out all the minerals, but I think it takes up most of them. Magnetize what my friend Aubrey actually had a problem because he was drinking it on a regular basis. Uh, you know, he wasn't aware of the consequences of not having enough minerals and he started getting like his heart was beating too fast. He was kind of freaking out. Like he had an electrolyte imbalance and it was because he was drinking distilled water all the time. Like you have to have like, people think that like salt is bad for you. It's salt is essential. Look, if you eat a pound of it, you're dead. Okay. But salt is in it. It's a huge part of what it is to be a human being. You need it. That's why they used to go to war for that shit.

Speaker 5:          00:57:49       They used to have salt wars. Like when people kill people for all their salts. My friend swears in distilled water. He, he drinks it every day and he should be careful. Well was great. The idea is if you take it with like some milk Himalayan salt, uh, something that has a lot of minerals in it or to some, if as long as he supplements with minerals, maybe he'll be okay. But Aubrey, I mean he went to a doctor and the doctor told them like, you have an imbalance here, so what are you doing? Why are you drinking that water and irons humidifier. Humidifier fire is a funny word. Yeah, that's a, you gotta be careful. But yeah, the floor, I think it just, it's just one of those things that no one will even address. They're like, oh, what do you think fluoride is bad too?

Speaker 5:          00:58:31       You're like, well no, you just should really, you're right. Even it's good. Don't want to be mass medicated against. And I will like, why do we need this in our water? Right. And it's also, I'm sure it probably does some weird shit to your skin too. Hot Water with fluoride in it. You get an excess of Florida gives you fluorosis which eats away. They namel over your teeth. So you see the yellow fucking like, yeah. Cause it's the opposite. Yeah, it actually, and it's so thing about what that's doing to your bones if you get an excess of fluoride. Oh Wow. I never thought of that. So, okay. Is this hippie bullshit? Nah Dude,

Speaker 7:          00:59:03       that's really funny though. The way you said that. No Dude. That's exactly what someone who's telling hippie bullshit. Nah Bro. Come on. Cause Jerry Yo dude, I read that shit. I'm going back website. I swear I saw on the Internet is legit fuck's on that floor. I dated in a water.

Speaker 5:          00:59:23       That'd be Martin and talk bad knowledge about that on our tea. Lots of research dogs, government. Is it, is it one of those things where like someone just started getting paid for bringing fluoride and then the fluoride is just a part of life now?

Speaker 3:          00:59:38       Yeah. The aluminum industry needed to get rid of their byproducts. They were on, they launched this propaganda campaign. There's like in the fifties and it was just this old school thing that was, we didn't really understand that we can just have better hygiene by brushing our teeth now was like, yeah, people did have fucked up teeth.

Speaker 5:          00:59:53       How do they purify water? Like when, like if, if the use, what do they use? They use chlorine or something like that. What chemicals? These surefire,

Speaker 3:          01:00:01       it's from the phosphate mining. So they, they take it and they just like, they capture the water that's escaping in these giant scrubbers and then they just sell it. Like, I don't fucking know what they did. A purified, I hope to God that they're doing something to purify it.

Speaker 5:          01:00:13       No, I mean what, I'm sorry. I should rephrase. What I meant was when, if you like, say if you get water out of the Faucet, when you go to this foster right now and get a glass of water, they're doing something in that water. Right. What do they do? Cause a purification. Chlorine fluorine. Uh, well we should ask, right? We should like Google this real dark.

Speaker 3:          01:00:31       As crazy as I just had this interesting, uh, thing with Nestle where they send us this lawsuit threat. Like they're basically threatening to sue us because I criticized their monopolization over the water supply and how they're trying to prioritize

Speaker 5:          01:00:45       water. Yeah, I've read that. I didn't even want to like actually read the quote because somebody sent it to me in Twitter and I looked at it. I was like, I don't even want to read that because it's like someone going to be bummed out by those duties.

Speaker 3:          01:00:59       There's the, see the ex CEO Peter Brabeck. He's still like a, I don't know, he's still highly influential at the company, but he came out and said, you know, it's a food stuff, like any other, it should be applied to market price. We should not like basically just privatized all the water in the world. And he was like, if he's like, if you think water's a human right, you're an extremist. I was like,

Speaker 5:          01:01:15       that's fucking great. And every single day,

Speaker 3:          01:01:18       yeah, this is probably Nestle. No, this isn't necessarily, but it seriously, every single bottled water I've seen as Nestle and a, it's terrifying. It's terrifying what they're doing right

Speaker 5:          01:01:29       during these routes. Yeah, correct. That's ridiculous. What a crazy way of looking at the world. So yeah, that's like, so he wants to treat water oil, essentially. He wants to fucking, what's the next air? Monopolize it. What we're trying to do. That wasn't someone trying to actually sell cans of air because wow, they do it in a hotel in Seattle. Well that's actually a oxygen. Yeah. It's like a pick me up. Like people think that like you ever go to the oxygen bar. They have like those picked me up bars. He used to have those. I went to one once, didn't do Jack Shit. I sat there on Tuesday. Windows feels like I just paid 20 bucks. It just gives you heightened awareness. I think just that they came a carrot.

Speaker 5:          01:02:12       I think just thinking that you're doing something that gives you a heightened awareness heightens your awareness cause you're like cognizant of it. Like yeah, I'm going to really, really focus. You talk about so much as the placebo effect because this is something that's fucking nuts. The fact that we can heal things with their body and people just dismiss it. They're like, oh, that's just the placebo effect. You're like, that's so fucking crazy. That's way crazier than like having medicine that cultivating this so much. But also it really begs the question, what is, what is the state of our body based on? Is it based on confidence and feeling and thoughts and the the, the kind of like ideas that you called debate or is it actually based on genetics and disease? Like how much is which way when all of a sudden someone can cure something because they think that the, I don't know how many instances where that actually takes place.

Speaker 5:          01:02:59       The placebo effect might be Greg greatly exaggerated. I don't know. I don't know how much has actually been done placebo style, but I know that it's big enough that it's occurred enough times where it's, it's documentable. Like people can like refer to it as an actual situation. There's a placebo effect that actually does happen. So what's going on there? I don't know. I think that it needs to be cultivated way more studied way more like I, it's just funny that it's kind of this weird thing in science. You're like, oh, it's just the placebo. It's like, have you thought about what that means though? Because that's fucking nuts. It's also, it makes you wonder what exactly is really shaping this world. Like how much of what's shaping this world is thoughts and how much of it is circumstance and how much of it is just random occurrences.

Speaker 5:          01:03:48       How much are you steering this thing with your thoughts when you find out that you can fix something that you didn't think you could fix because someone told you they gave you a pill that fixes it and then all of a sudden you fix it. Well, think about what stress does to you. Can you totally. It's crazy. It's bill that for you. Yeah. And also it makes you make shitty decisions. You do do rash things. You, you yell at people that you shouldn't, you're like, ah, it builds up. Yeah, it's terrible. It's terrible. Terrible. It's awful. But it's the way I saw this documentary about water and there was like this Japanese scientist who, you know, put different feelings in different bottles of water, a glass of water, and then I don't, I mean it's been debunked. Yeah. Apparently. I don't know. We'd have to get a debunker arm.

Speaker 5:          01:04:32       Right. But then the debunker would get all sorts of hate mail and it would never come, want to come back again. That's what happens when you debunk things, man. She does nick, Mick West, the guy who was the debunker on our show, he runs metal, bunk.com so he debunked everything. Anything that's, he finds out what's bullshit about something and debunks it and he's, he's right a staggering amount of times. And this guy's just, his timeline is just, hey, hey, on Twitter, people hate when you debunk their, should they so invested and JFK so invested in everything, whether it's Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, or whether it's fucking conspiracy from the Grassy Knoll, whatever it is, anti conspiracy,

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       or does it really take it like where you're like, I will look at everything and really kind of sort through it? Or is he just like, I'm gonna debunk kind of the main points?

Speaker 5:          01:05:25       Yeah, he's a debunker. He likes calling people and conspiracy to Zitter bullshit. Even if he's wrong. I mean, I don't know if that's right all the time, but it's pretty obvious. His trend is to debunk things. But along the way, I got to say, I've, one of the things that I've learned about this television show is the psychological effect of wanting to believe in something. And the, the similar attributes that I find in almost everyone who believes in something that can't be proven. There's very, very, very similar attributes as a very similar mindset.

Speaker 3:          01:05:57       But yeah, I agree. Um, but when I look at something like, you know, nine 11, I know what isn't logical and it's what they've told us this happened. Yeah. So it's like, I don't know what happened, but I know what didn't happen. So

Speaker 5:          01:06:12       that's another, that's one that always comes up whenever someone believes in something that's odd. There's always the, what about tower seven discussion, you know? Yeah. There you go. That's the discussion. That's the skin people in 2013. They're almost like Jesus Christ is 12 years of fucking tower seven can't do it anymore, buddy. I can't. Okay. I gotta tap out no more tower seven doc. We can't fix that thing. It's gone. It's gone. Let's concentrate on bigfoot. No, it's um, yeah, there's a, um, there's a reality to the world, right? There's a reality. And then there's a trying to decipher reality from looking at the past, whether the passage is five minutes ago, whether the past is two hours ago. When you're dealing with something monumental like nine 11, you're going to have a lot of noise. There's going to be so much information, good and real and bad and distorted and crazy and sane and logical and cryptic.

Speaker 5:          01:07:09       There's going to be a lot of shit going on. So you look at any catastrophic situation like towers falling and people dying and you're going to have a lot of craziness, so you're going to have a lot of shit that doesn't jive and you got to have a lot of shit that also leans towards a conspiracy. Then it's also the possibility conspiracy. And that's what people don't like to think. They don't like to think that it's not an either or. And that whom you don't know. You don't think unless you were there. Can't be sure.

Speaker 3:          01:07:39       Why is conspiracy about, it's been a, it's been turned into a pejorative where it just shuts down and you know, it's amazing. Really? Yeah, it is. That was actually deliberate effort by the CIA. What's really it? Yeah. They're so bad ass.

Speaker 5:          01:07:55       I wish I could score the CIA because they're so bad ass in so many ways that they could figure out how to fucking engineer human consciousness so they could just make conspiracy thing sync. Dopey. Oh, you got a conspiracy theory. You know what? Like the Gulf of Tonkin. What? Like the Northwoods document. Just rattle off a bunch of real shit. That's really like, what about Enron? Right. That's a good spirits.

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       They conspired. People got together and happens all the time. It's part of what makes people fucking group into little huts at the get together. They have a little tribes. They go, well, this one was one was just one of the fucker's got gold. They're right over there. They sleep at night. Let's go get them. They happen all the time. Yeah. I love the CIA. Just for the record, for the record, I don't, I like them individually as human beings. I hope they're nice, but as a group, I'm not willing to trust them unless I meet him. That's all I'm saying. Yeah. I remember when they were also at the center MK Ultra Shit. Yeah. So let me ask you this, and this is the fucking elephant in the room when it comes to a journalism cause you're, you, you're a journalist, you're looking official journalist, right? Legit. And you are also not afraid to talk your mind, whatever it is. You speak your mind about various controversial subjects. And then you see this Michael Hastings thing. Do you go, oh boy, I don't know the story. Tell me the story.

Speaker 3:          01:09:11       Okay. So Michael Hastings, uh, amazing journalist, one of the last real investigative journalists that we have that, I mean, he'd go on the court from media and just fucking destroyed. Like he just completely make everyone look like idiots. But he's very aggressive, very aggressive. But he was just like, you could tell he's just exasperated with the mentality that he was surrounded by it. Whenever we be like all these Obama apologists and stuff, when he would go and argue and he was embedded in Afghanistan for a while and actually did a report in the rolling stone about Stanley McChrystal, which was the commanding general general, the Afghanistan war that totally exposed as us, um, ended up getting him fired. And when you get a general who's commanding a war fired, um, you need to look out and like, you need to fucking watch your back. And so, I mean, he got death threats at the time, months later, his car driving like a hundred miles an hour down a fucking residential street in La and it just explodes.

Speaker 3:          01:10:04       Why the fuck would you be driving that fast? Nothing about it makes sense. He had just written a letter to his friends and family hours before he died saying, I have to go off the radar. The FBI's investigating me. Watch out. They're going to come talk to you. Um, it doesn't mean that it was the government who killed him. It doesn't mean that it's, there's some giant conspiracy. My view is that you get a commanding, general fired and he knows fucking people. He knows security contractors, private firms that can fucking take you out if you embarrass someone. I mean this should happen. This is a hit.

Speaker 1:          01:10:35       I don't know what happened to that guy, but it sure looks like it. I mean if you wanted to look at a movie scene, it's like a perfect movie scene. It is in a James Bond film of a political assassination. Yep. And it really is, the door's locked. The steering wheel start to turning towards the tree like ah, your cars because salary is going shut up, bitch. Why would I explain that on the air? I think all the old cars, everybody get an old really old dodge darts can be hacked too. And that's what the, yeah, that's nuts. Well that's what I read afterwards. We'll do some guy who worked for Clinton and for Herbert Walker. Bush was describing how it's absolutely possible. I don't know if it was him, was him, Richard Clark, which

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       I thought was strange in itself that this guy would come out and be like, it looks like a car hacking to me. You're like, you're fucking government insider. It was just strange. I didn't know why he,

Speaker 5:          01:11:22       I think the people in the old guard probably don't exactly like how shit is just so loosey Goosey with the murders these days. You know, they're like, hey, we didn't use to fucking kill report is like, this guy's going to security cameras everywhere. Like Bernstein's still a lot. But basically they, one of them died recently. I don't know a little bit of Bernstein,

Speaker 3:          01:11:45       but I mean, if you're asking if I'm afraid. No, absolutely not. I mean, if you can't live in,

Speaker 5:          01:11:49       I'm scared and I know you like being in the room with you for three hours. I can close. Oh, how scary is that? It's fucking terrifying. I wrote something down today as a joke, but it was about, um, this fucking meat that they're creating now. Ah, Shit. No, no, no, no. That's, that's exciting. No, there was a, uh, a meat that they're there. They've made synthetic meat and uh, you know, and I was just, yes, yes. And I was just figured out how to clone county. They took some cow meat and without actually, you know, increasing the amount of cows in the room, they increased the meat. They just put it in some sort of a test tube, costs hundreds of thousands of dollars, but they made like a cheeseburger. Why did this, this weird meat, and I wrote it, today's fake meats, tomorrow's fake person, solar powered program by the state reading minds and writing tickets for bad thoughts like this. Really possible, right? Like one day we could easily be in a world where we have robot people just wandered around enforcing the rules of a corrupt elite, a bunch of old dudes with fucking just wires coming out of their body, like barely hanging on, just evil, keeping them in in the game, waiting for life extension technology, just hanging in there with robots running around

Speaker 3:          01:13:05       like actual thought crime. It's not even funny with the NSA, just surveillance of everyone. Blanket data mining. And then this retroactive prosecution, the ability to retroactive. They prosecute you. If you fucking say something today, 10 years from now, they can dredge that up and be like you said this 10 years ago, wrongfully accused you of something and pull up all this evidence over the course of your digital life and use it against you. And that's another really scary aspect. It's not even just the chilling effect that quells descent and makes people not want to speak out as much. It's that too. And that's scary.

Speaker 5:          01:13:34       Yeah, that's very scary. It's very, it's all very scary. It's, it's we're, we're, we're in such strange times because if someone feels like they have the right to just look at everything you're doing all the time, like where are we, what are we dealing? Like we're not even America anymore. Sun America when everyone can just have their email looked at. And did you read the shit that David Seaman put on is a page today that about how they're using it. The DEA is using it now. They're using the information to catch drug dealers. They using the information to catch people selling weed. I mean, they're not, it's not just a security concern thing. This is information that's being distributed to other people. They're bypassing normal like protocol for catching criminals and just fucking, well, what's really crazy. Yes, you're right. But what's really crazy is that he said that this is what's good.

Speaker 5:          01:14:26       It was really weird, is that the NSA is giving your phone records to the DEA and they're telling the DEA is talking about how to cover it up and to conduct a fake investigation to acquire that information to back engineer your discovery and then going back and acquiring enough evidence, post knowledge of the crime to, you know, like that they're actually going to create a fake investigation. Well, he'd so that they hide the fact that they got this information from the NSA. Right? Right. Like, Oh man, that seems like a lot of work. Well, it doesn't just seem like a lot of work. It seems like you're lying, right? Like you should. Yeah, there should be some laws in this world, but there you, there also should be some nobility to the people that are enforcing those laws and one of them is you shouldn't be allowed to lie ever. Okay. Lines not good. Stop doing that. So if you're not lying, how much of this actually happens? Well, none, because people go, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. The DEA gets the fucking records too, right? Okay. Where do you draw the line? What if someone's giving a friend a bottle of Xanax because their prescription Randall able to be hacked.

Speaker 3:          01:15:31       So where the line really isn't drawn anywhere. When you have foreign governments or entities that could hack into this shit and then use it. I mean, who knows, right?

Speaker 5:          01:15:39       It's just, it's going to be out there. Everything's going to be out there. They're just slowly trying to stop it. They're still lying. They're like, oh no, it's just the metadata. It's just the metadata. And you're like, no dude, because

Speaker 3:          01:15:52       the the storage center in Utah or whatever that you're storing this, like the metadata would only account for like a fucking eighth of that information that's stored in there and you already building other ones. So what the hell else is the rest of it. Obviously it's everything just recorded and stored. Obviously.

Speaker 5:          01:16:05       It's amazing that anybody would think that's a good idea. Right? It's really amazing that anyone would say, yeah, this is what people are gonna go for this. This is a good, none of them are not going to feel like they're imprisoned at all. No, it's not a prison stays. Just willing to make sure that everybody listens. Yeah. Can't have that. That kind of power. Crazy fucks camp

Speaker 3:          01:16:28       the FBI is doing with the entrapment cases. I mean all of these like thwarted terrorist attacks in the last decade are all mostly manufactured by the FBI.

Speaker 5:          01:16:36       Brilliant. Amazing. Oh, there's that one that was really hilarious in Dallas where they got this guy who was like challenged. He's like, yeah, not a bright guy. They talked him into it. Gave him the bomb. Yeah. Okay. And told him how to detonate and he tries to detonate and they come in and arrest him for bomb them wasn't even real. You guys are playing, make believe like you're playing. Make believe in just Jack and morons, which I guess it's better that they take them off the street. Then some real kind of dude and the hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars, like coercing some mentally unstable to fucking

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       try to get to find those people. You got to do that. Then for the Tsa, I liked that. I like what you're doing and you find an idiot's gone years and they get paid like a hundred gcs informants. There's actually this one case of this guy in a mosque, I think I said, this isn't the last podcast. He actually scares people so much in this mosque. All these Muslims who were like, they actually called the FBI and reported him cause he was trying to radicalize them so much. It was like he was the terrorist and they were like, what the fuck? This guy is here trying to rile us up there and then they're like, oh yeah, he's working with us.

Speaker 5:          01:17:44       Jesus fucking Christ. Crazy problem, reaction solution. One of the worst cases of a undercover cops was without a doubt in my opinion that the people in Florida where they were uh, operation d minus whether you're sending undercover cops to go in and pose as high school students and try to,

Speaker 3:          01:18:05       Oh my God, cause some weed. So sad. And some kid actually like fell in love with, he was like, she was like 4.0 yeah, she's

Speaker 5:          01:18:12       hot. She's 25. She was a, she's petite. She could pass for bag. So rude. And would they, the craziest thing was a, what's that? A podcast. This American life. All right, well they have, they did a piece on it and they actually interviewed her and they spoke to her and she was like, you know, hey these people that you know shouldn't be doing that. They got to watch what they're doing. Like you, you found a boy, you found a boy and you were nice to him. And he tricked him and the boy tried to give her the weed for free. Tried to get her weed cause she, cause she asked him and he gave it to even really like, oh, he didn't smoke weed at all. He tested negative when they, when they arrested him. But they, uh, when they asked her, um, like where they were rather, uh, when she asked him rather to get it, he tried to give it to her for free and she insisted on giving him money so that she could make the arrest.

Speaker 5:          01:18:59       Wow. That's so rude. So mean. Meanwhile, here's my meanwhile there's real crime going on in, this is my point and I want to say this very clearly. Okay. Um, I'm not, I'm not a male apologist. I believe that on both sides people should be kind. And I think there's a competition between men and women that has rather unnecessary, whether it's feminist, some masculinist and a lot of it is unnecessary. But in this situation it's very strange because if the roles had been reversed, the outrage would have been exponentially greater if a man was pretending to be a high school student. And he was a super slick, 25 year old, been around the block, been driving for years. He's got a fast car. Maybe he's got a bunch of poetry books that he reads and she's just, he's so different. He still maturity. So that would be so rude if you found that some 25 year old pimp cat is banging 17 year olds and arresting them for getting them weed.

Speaker 5:          01:19:59       Could you imagine how much people would be upset and they would assume that the guy fucked her. I assume he fucked her, you know the girl was fawning him and next thing you know she's getting them weed for free and he's arresting her. It's so funny. It wouldn't, you would never stand for it. No one would stand for it. But as long as it's, it's one of those weird things where it's like, as long as it's a boy getting fucked over, even if there was a woman who conned him and lured him in, you are grossly

Speaker 3:          01:20:25       teachers, fucking young girls students either. You hear like a lot about women teachers like having affairs with like their high school students and stuff. I'd never really heard the story of the opposite happened.

Speaker 5:          01:20:35       My name is happened to my high school. Really? Yeah. Yeah. I don't want to say anymore. Who was a good dude and I knew the girl.

Speaker 3:          01:20:42       Yeah. Yeah. Um, what did you hear about that in Trotman case, this is fucking sad. This guy just liked to gamble. He was an optometrist, like, you know, just had his own career, had like mildly gambled, like 20 to a hundred dollars beds with his friends. And this FBI agent overheard him at a bar one night talking about, I'm waging a bet and he, so we'd be friended him and then for the next like six months or a year, just became closer to them. It goes on and they kept trying to up the stakes and basically at the end of this time frame, he convinced the guy to bet him $2,000 in one day, which in Virginia, that's like running a gambling operation. So he comes in and raids his house with a swat team and the guy gets executed on accident. There's like some trigger happy cop who just fucking shoots and kills him. I'm like, so, so you basically turn this person into a criminal. Not even that. I think that's a criminal to spend $2,000 in a bat, do whatever the fuck you want, but like that big shaped this person and then he just, it's just so sad.

Speaker 5:          01:21:37       Well, this has happened so many times before. There was a famous rolling stone article about a young man that was a, he was talked into selling this guy some marijuana and then he sold them some marijuana and they put together some sort of coke deal and the FBI agent completely encouraged him, set it all up, or the DEA agent, the undercover guy, set it all up, connected to two guys together and got this poor guy who didn't want to do anything, just slowly worked him and coerced him into the situation where you thought he was gonna make a lot of money to do this real quick and know. Meanwhile, there was no drug deal to be made. It was all fake. This guy just completely concocted the whole thing. It's fucking DEA asshole. So then this DEA asshole winds up being a complete criminal, gets kicked off the force.

Speaker 5:          01:22:25       Okay. It doesn't get prosecuted. Just gets it just removed and done. But you know who knows what he did? He was doing drugs. They'd know he tested positive for drugs. So he was in it yourself? Yeah, you have to. If you want to be a part of that world, you got to do coke with them. Right. And so this poor fuck is in jail for the rest of his life. His kid is just stuck and this was a long time ago, the article in rolling stone, I don't know if he ever got out, I don't know what the story was, but the kid was doing essentially the life in jail. You leave that there was a major league cocaine dealer. They put together a major league cocaine deal. Not really, but they did as far as like he knew and big. That's good enough. Sorry. Getting the box. When

Speaker 3:          01:23:00       you're like getting so close to these people, do you ever think like, wow, this is really fucked up when I'm doing like, I don't understand how these people can live with themselves. The ones who are in trapping these people for months and months and months in like befriending them and getting really close to them, then they realize that they are shaping these people and to become who they want them to be. It's a fucked up thing.

Speaker 5:          01:23:18       It is certainly that. It is certainly that. It's um, it's, it's a lack of humanity. It's the same thing as a corporation that can pollute a river and kill a bunch of fishermen because it's easier to do that than it is to take shit and put it in these toxic drums and ship it somewhere else. We all know that's happened too. I was like, what allows people to do the w would you look at a broad spectrum of what people capable of like what allows the worst, what allows the most extreme aspects of our personalities? We could have an empathy pill. Like I have a gene that's called yeah. But all the time. Yeah, well that's what we need to engineer all the time. Just a really mild dose of Ie. We just want to hug everybody. We will be so much nicer. But it's, it's one, it's really interesting because if you stop and think about the idea of engineering consciousness through pills, I mean that's what everybody's worried about when it comes to antidepressants and Prozac and things that people give kids for add. And you know, people were really concerned about this concept of engineering consciousness and what are the repercussions of doing this and giving people things. But what if they get it right? One of these fucking nail it and it just becomes, everybody becomes cool as shit. Like they just like they give you a pill and then all day you're on like a mild x to see super friendly mode, you know? And it gives you like a 20 30% Iq boast boost fast tracks evolution. Why not? It's not possible. It seems like it would be right.

Speaker 3:          01:24:46       It would be weird because what if something went horribly wrong,

Speaker 5:          01:24:49       wrong and well for the first few generations until we get it right

Speaker 3:          01:24:52       or all fucking getting pigs, it's pretty, pretty insane. This generation is pretty crazy.

Speaker 5:          01:24:57       Well, no one more so than those people in Saint Louis. That's a, that is a really hard thing to fucking read. It's a really hard thing to read to think that that actually did happen. Yeah. It's just so weird. It's so weird that people can do things that they can do and then other people are just cool as shit and normal

Speaker 3:          01:25:16       or like dropping white phosphorous in fucking Iraq that, that's against. What does that, what does white phosphorous, this and Cindy Arie, that's supposed to light up the air when you like drop it. When you look at bombing and Baghdad, when we invaded, um, you see like these like plumes of, of like light coming down and it basically just, it's such a high concentrated incendiary that it will just cut through skin. Like it'll just slice through your flesh. And so they've been using that. It's against. I mean it's totally illegal to use during warfare and Israel does it and so does this country still? Yeah, those depleted uranium. That's awful too. That will never go away. D you is there forever.

Speaker 5:          01:25:55       It's that areas like toxic. Yeah. For like how long? Millions of years. Oh

Speaker 3:          01:26:01       yeah. Shelf of D'you is like

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       knowing what is the idea about depleted uranium? Was that that it penetrates armor better than anything else. This radioactive coding on the, on the shell of something like the shell casing and I don't know what the fuck why you would ever use that if it's like so horrifyingly toxic for the environment, why do we need that? Like don't we have enough the way like high grade weaponry enough that we don't need to be using. Do you know what the fuck do you think those things are just like, let's see if we could do this. I think we could just shoot right through that thing with the DEU and they're like, God, go for it. Just like people watching the nuclear explosion, it was like glasses on. They're like, oh sweet. I think just no concept of anything in the future, past 10 years. Like what is this going to do?

Speaker 1:          01:26:50       The idea that anybody has the ability to make that call, hey, we're going to shoot these bullets and they should work a lot better than our regular bullets.

Speaker 4:          01:27:04       They poisoned the ground for a million. It's fucking million years. Listen, when I'm getting around, don't worry about it. It's a million. It's a hundred. We're going to give a shit bomb. We got a lot of this stuff. We have a lot of this stuff. We might as well make bullets out of it. What is depleted uranium? What does it look like? I don't fucking know. Let's look that up. Depleted uranium. Okay, let's see what the fuck it looks like

Speaker 1:          01:27:29       bedded. Uh, do you have to ps depleted uranium?

Speaker 4:          01:27:36       I bet it looks like, uh, a bit. It looks evil. Why is there a navy photo with no face? No, it's not.

Speaker 1:          01:27:44       I see a, I see a photo of it. Look at that. You and I need to, that's what it is. You try to find that photo. That's what depleted uranium looks like. And apparently it's just fucking awesome at killing shit. Just they figured out how to make something that's way better than regular metal.

Speaker 9:          01:28:04       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:28:05       Um, so what it says is the, its uranium with a lower content of the fissile fiss Ile Fussell you to 35 that the natural uranium and natural uranium is 99.27% you to 38 and 0.72% that you don't give a fuck about this. What am I saying this to people before I reading this? Because a lot of times when I go to Wikipedia folks, I've never read about this before, so I'm hoping that they'll sort of boil it down for me within the first paragraph. No such luck today. Kids. Just a bunch of numbers that I don't understand. But um, yeah, so that depleted uranium shit ain't good. Did you see a wolverine?

Speaker 4:          01:28:51       It was like, there's a reason why I'm saying this right outside the movie wolverine. How did she said no? Yes. With Hugh Jackman. Who else would be

Speaker 1:          01:29:01       willing when Walgreen for the past decade, Jesus Christ, I think he's the only Walgreen ever. It's never been an wolverine. Um, there's a scene in it from Nagasaki cause we'll ruins 150 years old or whatever. However he was when they made them, I forget. But uh, the idea is that he's a mortal and a in Nagasaki, like he gets involved in the, uh, the bomb. But you stop and think about that, like let a stir range ability that human beings had even in 1947 to throw something out of a plane, fly over, you throw something and just wipe out everything. Just wipe out the whole Shebang. Just flatten that motherfucker. Kill hundreds of thousands of people just like that.

Speaker 3:          01:29:45       But we needed to use it to end the war. Save lives. See Jacqueline working out looking sexy piece. I'll do it. I'm getting ready. It's hard to believe that he likes musicals to he's a perfect man. No, I think nuclear nuclear technology is, is bat shit crazy. I mean it, it can be used for good, but the thing is we don't have the capacity to harness it properly. Like look at nuclear energy. We can't store the waste and the waste doesn't go away for millions of years to say, what the fuck are we gonna put this? Like yes, in theory it's great, but there's this whole other component that we're just kind of ignoring and then look what happened in Fukushima when something goes wrong. I didn't realize until Fukushima, what nuclear energy actually was. I didn't realize it was just like water boiling and like these giant open air.

Speaker 1:          01:30:30       Yeah. So on the same page. So confused. This is what we're doing. This as a free ticket. You've got a son that makes and you can't shut it off. Oh good move lines here in the u s well listen, listen. Well you don't know. Okay. I've see where you would come with, this is an uneducated person, but I'm going to explain to you we need that. First of all, it's a major reason why coal is down on the use is many, many percent. Now there's a, we have the situation eradicate. There's, we're basically no worries. There's a, Fukushima was a very old design. We have various fail safes and backup generators and we don't pitch shit right next to the ocean. Like those crazy Japanese

Speaker 3:          01:31:17       we do. We have like 23 sister reactors all built by GE here in the exact same manner. Some built by fault lines.

Speaker 1:          01:31:23       There's one on the way to San Diego. You pass by it. You know what that is? Shutting that down, but they said it's going to take like 13 how'd you get shut out your process. Would you got the toxic water? Just dump it in the ocean, right when all the plastic bags. What do you mean shut down? What does that mean? I thought you couldn't shut him down. It seems like um, isn't there like a bunch of spots in Nevada where they just like dug holes? I'll just put it here. Do they have signs over? Those are like in a million different languages go no fucking 10 here. Right? Don't dig for the next million years. This spot sucks. Okay. 2012 thanks. When are we doing? Yeah, that's a weird thing. The fact that they have these areas where they dig a hole and they just put all their garbage. They're like, listen, I know this is all talk. So again, soon, whatever, whatever, dig a little hole here. Drop it off. Is this your land? Okay. Can we just dig holes here? Can we just pay you like a couple of g suite? Listen, you guys can have prostitution and gambling. Yeah. Oh you mean what they've done to it in your reservations? And that's pretty much what they did. They're just like everyone just gone was toxic areas with like no ability to like

Speaker 3:          01:32:34       farm or do anything and will just fucking give you gambling here. Aren't you happy here or gamble? Here's a free here's of alcohol, cigarettes.

Speaker 1:          01:32:41       If you think about it that way, that's a weird way of looking at it. But I guess a lot of, uh, native Americans would agree with you on that. They've don't live in the best spots. They don't give like the best spots away for, for reservations. You know, they're like, can we have Hawaii? No, no, nope. Okay. Know, like how many, like really good spots where the Indians were. We like, no, not this one bitch. And there's a lot of really good spots and Indians had where can't we build? Okay, go there. I, yeah, I'm wanting to know. I've, I've read a bunch of different versions of why they were called Indians. Some that makes sense that some that don't, but there's no denying that, uh, that name. The uh, the idea that I've, I've read two different versions of the idea that they thought that they were actually in India. I've read that that was the case and then also read that it was based on a word. I'm trying to remember what it was. Something meaning free man, India or something.

Speaker 9:          01:33:40       I like that. The indigo choke Chubby.

Speaker 1:          01:33:44       It's not a band. Indigo girls. How are they? Are they good children? Is like, we can't play them, but we have fan. Brian. I've too much a penis for that. What are you trying to say? That you can't be a man who was well endowed, who enjoys some chick music? No, I think they're more attracted to the culture. They're more attracted to that culture share. What the fuck are you saying? That's like shit. Indigo girls are like share men are more attracted to men or women or lesbian. Lesbian is. Okay. Did you guys hear about this? A this a boa constrictor. The got out of a, a pet store and climbed through the walls and into this kid's room. Killed a five year old and a seven year old. Oh my God. Yeah. I was in Canada. Apparently climbed over the wall of someone to just house. No, it was in like they had like a reptile place downstairs. Oh, in this fucking thing got out or fine. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:34:38       All these idiots that actually have exotic pets as pets here in this country. Did you know that there's more tigers in captivity in the u s and there was in the wild in the world. Really? Yes. We only Louis through did you knew who but I don't believe that. Now Louis through this, this awesome that works for the BBC does these crazy families. He lives with the Westboro Baptist church for like a month. He'll go live with like all these assholes who have tigers in cages in baboons and like giant snakes and he'll just like do this documentary about him and they don't know that he's actually mocking them because he's like British and so they don't really understand his humor and he's like being really sarcastic all the time. It's great.

Speaker 5:          01:35:19       Well he's also like super embedded he'll, yeah, exactly. Like he does. He's not like arguing with them as much as he's just encouraged them to communicate who they are, you know, which is like, you know the hard way to do it. You're embedded with the Westboro Baptist church. I'm like, you know, I've got to kill all these choirs.

Speaker 3:          01:35:40       They have like a really great sign making factory. He was like in there and he's like, he's like Nelson Mandela Fag. He's like, I don't, I don't understand. I just like the most random assignment. And then had his face on his sign because he goes back to the Westboro Baptist Church and then they made a sign with him and just said like Louis Theroux, fag lover or something. He was like, why did you make a sign about me?

Speaker 5:          01:36:00       Our human struggles. Just so bizarre. What a bizarre thing to struggle about what the Westboro Baptist church is one of the weirdest like branches of humanity because it's almost like we expect them to do something stupid whenever anything happens now and it becomes like an oddity, like a little side show at these things

Speaker 3:          01:36:20       and if we yeah, and it's like impossible to not pay attention to them cause there's so fucking outlandish, like the fact that they will just go and fly to picket funeral.

Speaker 5:          01:36:28       It's the part of the idea of struggle, you know, it's a part of the idea struggle that the battle between like advancement and thinking and this the, the monkeys, there's the fucking screaming apes that is still around throwing shit at each other, holding up abortion signs does it, but it's just a part of that fucking struggle. If you seen that, a photo of the, uh, the mountain goat and the cougar that felt their death. Oh my God, I want to see it. Hold that shit up. It's a series of photos. It's a battle. It over. It shows a battle because the, the mountain lion actually has the hair in his mouth of the, of the goat. They're both dead. They're laying out on a stretch of highway in Colorado where the road was closed. They went to war on a cliff and they both fell to the death.

Speaker 5:          01:37:13       And it's, it's, it's a wild fucking series of photographs. Look at this. Oh yeah. Well see that thing to the left, that's one of the horns from the mountain goat. Like it lost its horn in the process. And there's a series of photos, Brian, if you scroll down, it shows, that's where the horn came out. See, look, that's where the horn like literally broke off shit. Yeah. Okay. And that's the mountain lion. No, look in his mouth. You see the tough, tougher look at that. He got that thing in his mouth and they both went for a ride and landed boom on the ground. Look at this. Go. It's like, Oh shit. Boom. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       Fuck yeah, no need to look at it. But they show you the, uh, already look at it. If you just no need to look at that after you've looked at that. But if you, uh, uh, props to Javier Vargas, he's the guy who sent me that on Twitter, try to give out Twitter props. Yo. Um, but he, um, the, the, the website takes you to like a whole series of photos. It's pretty, it's just, it's not beautiful, but it is beautiful. Like I don't, I don't, I'm not happy that either one of those animals died. I'm not an asshole, but they died in a beautiful, yeah, it's fascinating. It's fascinating. It's like any weird strange work of art. There's something bizarre about you're capturing this image. Nobody influenced them. It's not like they were forced to do it in the coliseum for our amusement. This is just something that played out in the wild and they fell off a cliff and it's like, it's, it would have happened whether people existed or not. Most likely. It's just a fascinating, fascinating thing to see that this is how life exists when you take away language and you'd take away cities, you can takeaway advancement. It's just this wild group of things that are trying to eat each other and survive and keep moving and spread numbers.

Speaker 3:          01:39:03       How amazing is it that we live in a time where we can see all of the shit like the, the planet Earth series where you can just see what the fuck bacteria looked like in caves in like New Mexico or some shit like glow worms, spinning silk or like the goats on that mountain side. And that's what reminds me of that. Those goats that survived and like the, it's like a sheer face of a mountain and they're hunting and they're fucking running around. Like, how are they not, how are they even existing up there?

Speaker 1:          01:39:26       Yeah, it was amazing. I went, uh, I was in Montana and I watched these mountain goats climb up the side of these bluffs and they're standing in these like ledges. It's like a, uh, like a chunk like that wide. And they got one hook here and one of fair and it's not like, they're like, oh shit. They're like, oh, how do I get up here? And then just keep going. They're not like on a ledge. Yeah. They're just on a sheer fucking face and then that'll gangster was that mountain line to go, I'm going to take my chances. Yeah. It's like, yeah, allege manage. I think I grabbed that bitch by the neck and just lock onto, I'm right there

Speaker 3:          01:39:55       guy filming it. So they waited like weeks, like six weeks to finally catch them hunting or whatever. And it was like this epic chase on this mountain side and I was like, how are they not just collapsing and falling to their death?

Speaker 1:          01:40:06       The Cot. A mount mine hunting.

Speaker 3:          01:40:08       No, it was a, it wasn't a mountain lion. It was one of those goats. They were getting chased by something by a mountain liners. Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:40:14       Oh, so they filmed that. Yeah. Oh, it was insane. Yeah. Mount mines are really hard to film. That's one of the reasons why when people hunt mountain mines, it's a very, the hunting of mountain lions is very controversial and on one hand I see the point of the people that don't want them hunted. Like they're this majestic, cool creatures and it's amazing everything. But on the other point, like you've got to realize like if you don't keep their numbers to a manageable level, like the last thing you want is mountain lions like wild lions lion this year. Yeah. You don't want him like squirrels. You know, you don't want like pigeons just running around gravity slow. People like we'll a real problem. Like you need to figure out how many we need to keep and there's only one way to do that. You've got to kill him because nothing else tells them they don't have any enemies. The only, they die of old age and when they fall from cliffs, when they're holding on to goats, other than that, they're going to be fine.

Speaker 3:          01:41:06       Did you hear about the pack of wild pit bulls that killed that jogger? What? A fucked up way to die. Yeah. That's not fun. Horrible way to die. That it seems like she was with two other people and they like the owner was just like watching it happen. The pit bull just like destroyed this woman and then the, they were able to get help, but the girl died. I think that's terrible. Yeah. Horrible.

Speaker 1:          01:41:28       Yeah. And I'm also fucking no joke, right? It's, we around them all the time. We get used to the fact that we for the most part have them under control, but just dogs. I have two dogs and one of them was a smaller dog. One of them is pretty big. It's like 140 pounds. And I was thinking if he just decided like, I just want to see what it tastes like. You know, if a dog really wanted to do that, we were pretty sure they're not going to, what do they really want it to? It's not a lot stop.

Speaker 3:          01:41:54       Yeah. It's, you know, they are, they are creature that that's their instinctual something snaps and they fucking go for,

Speaker 1:          01:42:01       well, it's going to be weird, really weird if people do create this synthetic sort of, uh, artificial, uh, meat. If they really do create that and it starts being something that's sold on a regular basis, what are we going to do? Like, are we going to keep grazing cows? Is going to be a way to justify the fact that you're, you're killing an animal. Oh, we'll get to the point where we just won't let cows mate that often just keep a few of them around so they don't go extinct and just eat these fake burgers.

Speaker 3:          01:42:31       I think people will always want to eat the real animal.

Speaker 1:          01:42:33       Really. Some will shoot them or if they just want authentic. Yeah. It'd be like a diamond. Like chicks don't like server cubic Zirconias I just don't know how it was like this. Is this the real deal? Was this forged in the bowels of the earth? I know. Uh, yeah. If it tastes better, what if it tastes better? What if like regular meat tastes like shit? Yeah, I'm down to, yeah, why not? As long as, well, I'll let people try it for about a decade or so. Before I jump in. You want to be real careful?

Speaker 3:          01:43:07       Yeah. Talk about being Guinea pigs. Gmos. Did

Speaker 1:          01:43:09       you see this thing on? Um, there was a, um, uh, an article, it's on my Twitter where the scientists put Mona Lisa, a tiny Mona Lisa, the, they drew it on a surface, one third, the width of a human hair. It's incredible. This incredibly precise instrument at the Georgia Institute of Technology. They have printed Mona Lisa odd, an Ab straight surface, 30 microns in width, which is one third of the width of a human hair. Can you pull it up? Yeah. Yeah. It's actually pretty good. It's amazing what date is what date it's on science space. robots.com and it should be there today. If you just read right, look for scientists, paint Mona Lisa on surface. Just that and I'm sure it will pull up the uh, the article. But yeah, that's it. That's a Mona Lisa they made, they made that on something. One third the size of a human hair. It's pretty fucking good to like, it's hard, man. I don't know. Wrap your head around that. It's hard. What the fuck? They just froze the light. Yeah, they did that too, right? For how long? How long did you freeze line a minute. Does that make sense?

Speaker 7:          01:44:27       No. What does that mean? What happens there? And you freeze light and then you go to the speed of light. What happens is, so for sure for pop out here, how your spaceship and come down here to fix the world. What the fuck man.

Speaker 1:          01:44:40       Crazy three d pen that they can draw like in the air now and make like a dude. I don't know. Look like an image. Yeah. Oh my God. Yeah. How much do you know about, there's pens that apparently record what you're right. So if you write something down, so there's a pen, like if I gave you this piece of paper and I had you write things down, what you wrote down would actually show up in a computer. That technology has been around for awhile but is it why? How does that work or does it have to sync up with the USB? Yeah, you like sync it up to your computer and it's like rights into a document for them. But if it, if, if you could do it with the sync up, you could probably do it. Wifi, right? That they have it. Cause I saw the first one actually when I worked at gateway, they used to have them so some CIA dudes could probably be able to hook it up for Wifi.

Speaker 1:          01:45:25       Oh yeah. Or Yeah. Seems like it. Right. That's amazing because somebody told me about this guy, um, that uh, we, we actually wound up having this guy on a r a t v show and he's a psychic. His name is Ben a check. And I can't tell you what he does in the show, but he, he'll tell you that it's all bullshit. He's like, he's, he's a mentalist. I shouldn't say as a psychic what he does it, he debunks a lot of what people think is psychic, but it's just trickster. He Shit, he just, he's a master and all this trickster he shit. And I was trying to figure out how the fuck he did what he did. Cause it was really kind of trippy. And one of the things that I think might be possible, I've been just running through this through my head is uh, one of those pens that as you write things down it without like you could seal it in an envelope and he has access to the information that is possible today. Right? Yeah. Yeah. Without a doubt. Right. It has to be about, they could probably do the same thing with like a keystroke thing too. Oh, they aren't there it is. Two gigabyte Wifi. Smart pen. Boom. [inaudible] 79. Wow. It's only $179. That's incredible. What does that dude's name from um, the uh, double o seven movies that got all the gadgets. Their Watson, the guy that's sherlocking who was the

Speaker 7:          01:46:42       got it. Right. You guys know that was one guy. What's his name? The dude who was like, this is the new, yeah, the dude. Was it Q? I don't know his name too.

Speaker 3:          01:47:00       Okay. Spell the shit in it. Yeah, I would see two. Please look at the three d pen. I want to see if I, if I actually saw it.

Speaker 5:          01:47:07       Yes. His name was Q was a fictional character in the James Bond films and novelizations Q standing for quartermaster. Huh? Yeah. There was a bunch of these dudes that played Q.

Speaker 3:          01:47:23       Yeah. Wait, you're talking about no way. What does that look like? Go down and see the image, how it works.

Speaker 5:          01:47:33       So this is the pen that you write something.

Speaker 3:          01:47:36       You can write something like an air and it would it actually just draw like a

Speaker 9:          01:47:39       three d.

Speaker 5:          01:47:40       Okay, so he's filling in this.

Speaker 3:          01:47:42       Thanks like icing. Wait. Okay.

Speaker 7:          01:47:45       It says doodler and then this is going to just show up in the air. Is that what this, is this the wrong video? There you go. Oh Wow. That is crazy how simple it is. Wait a minute. That's like a pen that makes like, it's like silly puddy comes out of it. Kind of. Yeah. It's like that plastic stuff. We used to take those little straws and blow the little air bubbles. Okay. That's stupid. That guy's an idiot. Not really buddy. Relax dude. Don't get uptight. Yeah, he's making a strange time. It's actually pretty cool. It's cool. But like in a bit dazzle kind of way.

Speaker 3:          01:48:31       True. They just created this substance that water doesn't stick to it. So you can like put it on your shoe.

Speaker 7:          01:48:38       Yeah, on it. That's crazy. We showed a video though. This guy just ran through a mud puddle. It's fucking nuts. You scientists and it's all

Speaker 5:          01:48:48       [inaudible] so fucking quick. Every day there's some new thing.

Speaker 3:          01:48:51       If only we had the most smart minds in the world working toward technologies that are good instead of like weapons. And I mean thinking of wasting.

Speaker 5:          01:49:00       Sure. Yeah, you're right where you are. Right. But we do as well. It's almost like, do you ever think about the possibility, and this might be total hippy bullshit, but is there a possibility that we need a bunch of dickheads in the world in order to motivate the good people to act and that sorta like the struggle is imperative in the human condition, the Yin and the Yang, that it's almost like a, there has to be assholes in order for people to push society further in order for us to really recognize her.

Speaker 3:          01:49:28       Yeah, I think you're right. I think there's always going to be a balance of, of good and bad, but I don't think that we need to let the assholes get to the extent where they're actually like fucking up the planet for the rest of us, which is where we're at right now. So if we curve the asshole's back to a manageable level.

Speaker 5:          01:49:40       Yeah. Or The assholes fucking things up. This motivates the really smart, nice people to develop some of crazy technology

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       that eats plastic and eats plastic and, and it creates flowers that grow in your mind and enlightened that doesn't make sense. Stick needs to eat mushrooms. Well, they'd said that fungus is actually the best way of dealing with a plastic that they've confound found funguses that they can mutate and get them to eat plastic. Really? Yeah. There's, there's no, there's, there's been some, some headway in that. That's one of the ideas coming up with, yeah, it's still scary. It's still scary when you see this, the very studies about how large the patch is and how much of an area it covers and how much actual material is out there. It's spooky. It's not an island. That's kind of a misnomer. It's actually clean pool. Yeah. I've called it an island before plastic. It's um, cause I was trying to like figure out, I guess that's not the best way to say it because it really is floating.

Speaker 1:          01:50:37       So it's not really an island, but it's, it's a giant area, man. It's big. It's big. It's like Texas sized. Right. Bigger, bigger than Texas. Jeez. If you've ever driven through Texas, just imagine all that fucked drive all the way through Texas and all that. It's just fucked in the middle of the ocean. I don't know if they're gonna be able to fix that and our lifetime, it's going to be really interesting if it gets all the way to Santa Monica, if it just gets all the way to the fucking shores and it washes up on the boardwalk and everybody's like, Hey, what the hell it is, we'll send it to the future or something. That's what it will happen. We'll create time travel and then we'll send to all our trash to like 50,000 years from now and then we could, we can't even send that stuff though at this point.

Speaker 1:          01:51:22       You're dealing with so much volume, you couldn't really send that. Like if we wanted to like scoop it up and put it in rockets and shoot it, you know that what fucking cost. It'll be so quick cause you can't clean it up. So it's so many micro particles of plastic and all these fish have formed their habitats within the plastic trash swirl. So it's like they have to write, they had no choice. It's like animals that were taught in the Congo when the Congo or grew out of the grasslands, the uh, the rain forest trapped. All these animals like antelopes and the like, rhinos and shit, they all got trapped in this rain forest. It just erupted. I didn't know where and changed their habitat. These poor fish are dealing with that, right? The, yeah. If we did scoop it up and just launch it in this space, that would be when the aliens would land. They would be like the angry neighbors. They'd be like, bitch, what the fuck are you doing? I said, we've been watching. You guys know is way too fucking far right. You're okay with nuclear power but you're throwing fucking bags of trash over the fence. Stop it dicks.

Speaker 1:          01:52:25       Fucking we are. We are the shitty neighbor of space. Is that what we are praying and last day, second worse than us, right? It's probably going to be, you're right. What if they're like more advanced and more douchey and we just end up in the seaworld of space. They just suck us up and make us do tricks. Maybe that's what we're doing here and what I

Speaker 4:          01:52:46       realize it, number one, Stephen Hawkins came out and he was like, by the way, aliens are most definitely out there and there we should not be looking for them because they're most likely wanting to like take over the planet. Everyone was like, what the fuck? We're like Stephen Hawkins is that, no. You know what's hilarious?

Speaker 1:          01:52:59       Every one of our scenarios in a film of the aliens coming starts off bad but ends us with us kicking ass. Right. Okay. But what was the last time we went and scooped up some chimps and shit went wrong. You know what was the last time we went on a monkey search expedition just starts scooping them up with nets and, and it went terribly wrong. We lost control of the planet and get the fuck Outta here. Like once they start kicking our ass, like if they can come here from other planets, we got a real problem. The thing is are they real or just a war of the worlds again and it was fucking terrified. Tom Cruise one. Yeah, it's fucking terrifying.

Speaker 4:          01:53:36       Whole Metaphor about what we're doing to the planet anyway and just suck it all up and just spraying our shit back at us. Like it's, you could argue

Speaker 1:          01:53:43       I've always done that, but we've never done it to this level. Like they, there was horrible, horrible pollution in ancient times. If people would get sick because they didn't have proper sewage systems and they'd be, people would be throwing the shit out the window. And there's a lot of like human waste, like whether it's waste byproducts from their body or waste from the, the food that they have that created rats and the rats carry diseases, not created rats. We encourage them to be in the area. There has always been that sort of a situation. There's always been like this bag better now. Yeah. Right, right. You're right. You're right. It's like what we were talking about her,

Speaker 4:          01:54:16       we know that we don't shit where we, but for some reason we sound like we know that. Not Do that. You say that, but we do it anyway. Right. People that we show with the people crazy. Right.

Speaker 1:          01:54:26       It's a, the battle. It's the constant struggle. The in the Yang, the good and the bad, the sense and the nonsense. I'll just fucking Duke in and out to try to get to the end point. That's what, or was it Orson Welles? Yeah. H G well said. He said that, uh, that history is a race between education and catastrophe. I've used that quote way too many times to not know exactly who said it. So if you're going to use paternity, doesn't know it. No real legitimately didn't remember. Relax. There's all these conspiracies floating around through the Internet.

Speaker 4:          01:54:59       Better to paradise fade away or you definitely fuck you. Trying to say that was called a conversation stopper. What's fair kind of porn, which I go to porn like amateur or that's wrong. That's what you like. You looked at amateur shit like solo male masturbation. Backyard black. I like Rebecca Linaris. Oh, you have like a specific girl he liked watching. Okay. The whole world just pulled the pants off right now. Then like he's Abby. Please keep talking. The best is porn on vine. That's the best because my favorites a, there's a girl named Siri ruiner pulled. Oh No, no, it didn't. It doesn't

Speaker 1:          01:55:43       matter. Yeah, there's tons of porn and it's the best because most girls are just like, they get right to it. Like I'm right. Open it up and stick my finger in it. Oh, now it's going to loop. I'm, I open it up. It's sticking your finger. Perfect boobs. Amazing on vine. Huh? Check out Siri Aaa. A lot of free time was spent with his pants off. I've never masturbated mine. Duncan Trussell has created this thing called some in the NSA. Oh yeah. He told me about it and created a website where you click a button and in one button it Google search. Just all like the terrible shit. Everything. Don't do it. Don't do it from here. Don't do it kind of here, but whatever you do, don't do it from here. And they Google, they Google the Google searches, like pressure cookers, backpack. I was hired right idea and it's all in one button.

Speaker 1:          01:56:36       I just saw this really, really awesome, a parody about the NSA that said, here's how we're going to beat the NSA. Just talk like a terrorist all the time. Like it's shut like this mom calling her kid and her kid was just like, all right, I'm going to go blow up the school. And the way code names should all start. That's actually funny. Was it a comedian? The, yeah. That's great. That's really funny. He just overload. Oh, that's hilarious. Somebody, whatever you do don't. Well, just this luck. We're lucky that already didn't figure that out on its own or would a road that shit to the fucking rocks. What a warped reality that Snowden just got granted. A silent by Russia. Yeah, right. Well, you know what happened? Do you know the whole story behind it that the United States that somehow or another criticized Russia for a silencing political dissent and they were like, what?

Speaker 1:          01:57:22       Bitch? What did you just say? Do you know who's at our airport? And they were like, oh, okay, listen. Yeah, yeah. Ed. Hey, what's up vitamin? Yeah, come stay at my house, dog. Come, come hang out bitch. Are you crazy? Did you really say that you criticizing us for silencing political dissent to you fucking know that's so silly. We have the biggest story of all time when it comes to like a lack of privacy. This is the biggest story of all time. It's the fucking, somebody pulled the curtain back and we saw the wizard. We saw the wizard like it's, that is the biggest story of all time when it comes to privacy. This guy said, hey, by the way, I used to work there. I didn't even graduate from high school and this access to Dan, he didn't even graduate from high school. Right?

Speaker 1:          01:58:08       And he was like, well, but I can read your email. So what's up? What happened? And I was just a dude. And by the way, we're also tapping into China's hospitals. It erode that shit like civilians, the structure in China. It's like what the hell? Well, what's fascinating is yes, why? Well, I don't know, maybe they have an answer, but an even more fascinating that they chose to do this and to try to discredit this guy by going out by the, with the fact that he was a high school dropout, right? Like this is a shady character, a high school dropout and drop out work for you and have access to everybody's,

Speaker 5:          01:58:42       what the hell are you doing? What are you doing? And it makes you realize like, oh these crazy fucks. They thought no one was going to check them. They thought no one was going to pay attention. They were just going to keep doing what they've always been doing. And they can just keep pushing it and they just didn't realize that they were doing it like completely out in the middle of a field in the open. They're like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh shit. And I left with the media is all like, oh well come back here and face the music. You're not a hero until you come back here. It's like, why? So we can sit and be fucking tortured. Like Bradley Manning was for years before he's even given a kangaroo court and yeah. And you're not saying that, that sounds like an exaggeration. Like oh that's really tortured.

Speaker 5:          01:59:19       No, he, well he was, yeah. And this is one of the claimant's torture and naked solitary confinement when it was cold. Like they kept him by himself for years. Right? Like how long did the key claim solitary years. But I think it was like three years before I got a trial. But yeah, he was, he was stripped down naked, forced to be stripped down naked every night and totally dehumanized. No outside contact at all. Very Sad. It's the whole thing is so strange. It's like if we really wore this really kind and and noble country that we will want to think that we were, we would have this person and we would use this example as an example of how to treat someone who disagrees with you but breaks the law, how to treat them humanely, how to, you know, how to bring this up in discourse with the, the rest of the people of this country, but instead of like doing something horrific and cruel to them and doing it out in the open and doing it where everybody's aware of it.

Speaker 5:          02:00:11       It's like you showing your intentions. Your intentions aren't to govern the world and govern the world and make people live in a better place. You're, your intentions are to enforce your law with an iron fist. My question is, where's the Apache helicopter pilot? Who did blow up those AP journalists? I'm Betty. He's living large. Hanging out. Oh look. See now the guy who like did the war crime in the video that Bradley manning exposed. Just like what a, what a fucked up two tier justice system. Well, I don't think that guys live in large and I think that guy's paying psychologically whether or not he has to go to jail. I meant more like on the bigger scale, Donald Rumsfeld, the real torture, like actual criminals who implemented all, you know. Yeah. Could you imagine getting high with Donald Rumsfeld, Donald Rumsfeld to do bong hits? Just get, I'm super paranoid and freaking out and then just start talking about the Iraq war theory to Larry King now worked for our t.

Speaker 5:          02:01:05       He interviewed Donald Rumsfeld for like an hour and I was like, damn, Larry King works for our team now what? That's, that's weird. That's fascinating. It's really fascinating. Larry King, why is he worked for our teams that just like you wanted to keep working and he just decided after CNN just go back at it. I mean, I didn't know he was still doing doing news. I thought he'd kind of retired him was doing like very nice guy. So He's been a very nice guy to me. I've met him twice. It's really nice. You know, I think he, well he hosted the third party debates at Aarti and then Aarti like just offered him a job. I guess. It's really strange.

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       Well, he's iconic, you know, he's one of those guys that people, even if you don't necessarily want to hear who is being interviewed, people listen a certain amount will listen because Larry King's interviewing them like, but he doesn't like king.

Speaker 3:          02:01:53       Yeah. He doesn't have any opinion. All of a sudden he just asks. Yeah. That's how he can get access to these people like Donald Rumsfeld. So it's like, do you want that

Speaker 1:          02:02:00       Gary? Yeah. Yeah. He's enormous access threat. Yeah. Kind of have to be that guy. If you want to talk to the president, right. If you're lucky, you know, you have to like, you have to have a long history of not getting crazy, you know? Have you ever been crazy at all? Like probably Geraldo Rivera doesn't even get to, it doesn't get to interview Obama. Mm. You might do something goofy just to get attention. Yeah. You have to have like a certain level, like a Matt Lauer. Matt Lauer is not fucking around. He's taking this seriously. God, Katie Couric, she's not doing anything crazy. She's going to ask you questions and be very respectful. You can't be some wild. Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:02:45       Came out in the wake of Michael Hastings death and he was like, you know, I'm really sorry for, for uh, the loss of everyone for Michael Hastings. But he did get one of the best generals of Afghanistan were fired and really like fucked up the war. It's like, yeah, that's, that's great taste dude. Like yeas, after he dies, it's just like tweeting.

Speaker 1:          02:03:00       Well he was showing his ass. Yeah, that's what he's doing is showing his ass to the new world order. Look, kiss my ass. I'm on. Come on. Love you. I liked that shirtless photo. Yeah, he's an interesting cat. You know, that's why I brought him up because I was aware of that tweet. He said are fighting one of our best fighting generals. Like what are you saying? What does that even mean? Doesn't mean anything. We were losing the war mean first of all has nothing to do with this guy dying. Right. So this guy, did he make things up? Like hiring someone, what happened? It was just, okay, what he, you did those like generals who are doing a bad job. I mean, I don't know. It becomes a weird thing. It's like what you know, does it arm, does it aid the enemy? That's like the big question. Does it aid the end of, that's the big question. I know Barry Crimmins is political comic from Boston old school guys been around a long time and he said Bradley Manning was acquitted of aiding the enemy because we're not the enemy. And you're like, Oh snap. And I mean that's essentially what I mean. He definitely violated a bunch of rules and they're most likely going to jail them. But

Speaker 3:          02:04:05       no problem is he's still facing over a hundred years in prison with all the charges, the 19 charges and there's like six charges of SB and I was still, but the SBA, the fact that Obama's actually gone to the level that he has to prosecute whistleblowers and criminalize whistleblowers is so fucking crazy to me because he's dredging up this world war one piece of legislation that was used for foreign spies and using it just like Willy Nilly. He's like, oh, espionage act like why? I mean, what did, what did Edward Snowden to do other than tell us about an unjust law. Like yes, he broke the law, but he's exposing something that's illegal

Speaker 4:          02:04:38       and unconstitutional. Like the government's breaking the law. Right? So it's all relative. Yeah. It down to that wartime thing. Especially at wartime. He never supposed to do anything that weakens your government. You know, that was the, what Geraldo was trying to express. You know, I don't think he realized how people are going to take it, especially after guy dies. You know the guy was a reporter. Okay. It's not like he made things up. Okay. The guy was a reporter and you can't say can't help but remember that you can't say that. That's stupid. It doesn't, but yeah, in the same tweet. I mean motherfucker, the guy's life isn't even where the tweet without reminding people of Geraldo expose the coordinates like during the Iraq war. Did he? Yeah. You remember that? He like gave a coordinates here. He's the one who fucking, how did he do that?

Speaker 4:          02:05:26       He was like fucking reporting from some, from some foxhole. Did he see rock and they were like, you just fucking like talk about aiding the enemy. He actually did aid the enemy. He rock. Oh my God. I have to time to look this up in Amaze Geraldo and then I think that's when he got kicked off like war covering. Oh Geraldo exposing war coordinates. Oh my God. Well he's also the one that interviewed the soldiers that were guarding the poppy fields. Do you know that? Have you ever seen that? I have not seen him interviewing him. Was He asking them what? It's wonderful. This is what's wonderful about it is because he's not like, what the fuck at all? He's like, well, this is just something that we have to do here. Why do we never see them pull it up there and why you would have to maintain the Bobby field?

Speaker 4:          02:06:12       It's important because we need heroin, right? We need, we need a late tax for our [inaudible] know. If for these people to give us information, we have to let them do what they do. It's rather unfortunate. Even though the Taliban had eradicated opium crop before we invaded, and now 90% of the world's heroin comes from Afghanistan. Yeah. It has nothing to do with it. Is this it? Yes. Fox News live from Africa. Here we are tolerating it. We are tolerating the cultivation of the OPM because we know that if we were to destroy it now, the population would turn against the marines and it would be a real security risk. Let me introduce, we tend to put all Brian Krebs therapy, third battalion, sixth marines, a really a wonderful group of marines here. I know you care deeply about this. Uh, this contradiction. The fact that here you have one of the best fighting force in the world, ever rounded is one of the strangest interviews ever. You watching this opium is being grown. I know how to adjust your gut. How do you deal with it? What are you doing? Well,

Speaker 10:         02:07:14       frankly, he says part of the culture. So while it might grind in my gut and it's what they do, we provide them security, we're providing them resources, and then we're providing them alternatives and the alternatives or different crops to grow. You're getting the seed and the fertilizer. You can do it. Uh, they can, they can rotate any of their crops now that they want it. They want to get rid of their wheat and grow cotton for the winter. They can that and we're gonna help them

Speaker 1:          02:07:36       do it. So whatever we, whatever crops, cotton, heroin, whatever, we're going to help them out. They don't want to ruin their culture. We don't want to disrupt their culture. We're bombing the shit out of them, destroying everything else. But we don't want to fuck with the opium. There's Geraldo manscaping wearing towels. Oh yeah. I can't. It hurts my feelings ordinance. Oh Man. Yeah. This is the drug war is so ridiculous. When you look at something like that, it'll take care [inaudible] 2003 10 years ago, Fox News channel correspondent, Geraldo Rivera as being expelled from my rack for broadcasting. Details about future US troop movements in the country. Hey, per fucked up. You made a mistake. Handsome, faster though. Still even at this age, still rocking that, that Harry Reems mustache. Yup. Hey, you made a mistake. I'm sure he didn't mean to do it. Whatever, whatever. Just out there.

Speaker 1:          02:08:37       Heroin Cop, and if we're talking about aiding the enemy, it is a pretty funny thing. He fucked up. He didn't mean he didn't mean I don't think he willingly did it right. Is it the idea? Is it Bradley manning willingly did it? Well, Bradley Manning, what he did was start the dialogue and that's what Julian Assange's did too. He started the dialog and these guys are all obviously vilified and turned into monsters because they started the dialog. But look at that. Oh Shit, Geraldo. It's just really, really, really fucked up. Here's what really fucked up the tower was way too low dog for anybody that's way too low for Justin Bieber. Those like there's no age when you're allowed to do that. That's not old for Joe. That's, that's too low for Justin Bieber. It's tool for John Meyer and it's too old for her role, so it covers all bases.

Speaker 1:          02:09:24       It covers like young teens or 20s it covers thirties enhance of. He had John Myers Goddamn Stud. He's a walking God, but you can't, I don't want to see your fucking phones. Right, right. That's the call them the kids these days. They call them the fuck bones, the upper musculature of the hips. I don't need to see that. Those fuck bones. Yeah, he fucked up. He's crazy. He's crazy for showing us so much. If the guy just had a nice pair of boxer shorts on. Did Bush paint that? You heard about Bush painting, right? Yeah. He paints a lot of Cox, right bathtub. He paints himself in the bathtub. Oh, he does his painting while he's in the bathtub. He painted himself. That's the paintings that he painted was his sad face. Looking in a mirror and then like his naked body in the bathtub? No. Which Bush? Bush jr. Oh God. Yeah. Do you imagine the nightmares floating around that? So I'm, that guy is mine. He probably didn't even want to do that job. Just kicking it. Painting. Yeah. But hanging around a bunch of dudes with machine guns, just looking left and right. Everywhere you go. Did you ever see that video of George Herbert Walker? He went into a restaurant and this guy just starts screaming, you're a war crime at all. Awesome war crime at o.

Speaker 4:          02:10:34       And it's,

Speaker 3:          02:10:35       it's really freaky because, uh, you know, no one knows how to deal with it. This guy's obviously willing to get arrested. There's all these secret service guys and you know, he's this old man, this old rickety man and he's walking, at least I hope these people are hounded for the rest of their lives and tried to be put under citizen's arrest and they can't travel because they're wanted for war crimes and other countries. They've already been declared like under a international courts to be a war criminal. I hope that they fucking live in suffer every time they go out in public. Fuck these people.

Speaker 4:          02:11:02       Oh, I hope they take mushrooms and apologize. Yeah, that would be great. Is this all bushes drawings? [inaudible] you find the one in the bathtub because these ones were actually hacked. Someone hacked into his email account or something and found, so he's only released the ones that are dogs, but he does find the bush in the bathtub. Dude. It's fucking weird. Did you read, uh, with Jimmy Carter said recently that we're no longer a functional democracy. Jimmy Carter is amazing. He's, whew. That's a weird one, Huh? Look at that Bush painting a bunch of dollars. That's what he does are there is there is open, that's him. There was one of his face in the mirror. Go up and click on the left hand side one. Yeah. Can even large at one. Oh my God. Look at his face in the mirror. You can't click on it. You can't zoom in. That's as much as you can see. Oh Man. Well quite perplex looking back at him like very weird, surreal lists like inside.

Speaker 1:          02:12:07       Wow. Weird. It's, you know, here's the thing about art. Okay, there's one thing if you suck at it, but it's another thing if you're old and you suck at it, right as it comes through, really weird. It's like if you're not a thing, if your Bush, if you're a fucking eight year old and you just learning how to paint, that's one thing. But there's something strange and I don't know why. How about someone who's really old? That paints that sucks, dude, move on. You're not good. And you think it's the drawing is one of those things that you either have a talent for. You don't like. Singing is clearly that way. Singing to me, like I have zero singing talent, so I know that I can't do it, but I've see people saying that don't have any lessons at all and they just have a voice that just can carry a note. Do you think that's the way withdrawing too? No, I think, I think

Speaker 3:          02:12:54       art is different because there's so many different mediums and I think that we've been conditioned as a society to not approach art and think that, oh, we're not artistic and stuff because really imagination and art are what drives like creativity and, and reinvention. And so like every great and Venner has been an artist in a sense because he's imagining something that didn't exist. So if we are stifled and we don't, you know, by the powers that be or whatever, and art and music are the first things cut from public education and really it's fucking up society because people, when they don't express themselves artistically in any sort of fashion, then that's inhibiting their own like personal growth and Catharsis. Yeah. I think

Speaker 5:          02:13:32       what we were talking about earlier about men needing some sort of competition and sometimes women as well, I think people need a focus that it's, it, it really helps us to figure things out because we don't have to figure out how to do it.

Speaker 7:          02:13:44       You look at this, the photo so weird. It's so weird even in low resolution

Speaker 5:          02:13:51       cause we don't have to uh, figure out a way to hunt or fish or defend against enemies. We have this, we have this like need to like make progress and make things happen and figure things out. And creating is one great way to do it. Yeah. It's like yeah I was sitting down doing something, figuring out how to write a story of figuring out how to,

Speaker 3:          02:14:11       do you think that's why so many people have anxiety now because and as we've evolved as humans, we needed like huge adrenaline rushes to go hunt or to do things like that and fight and, and getting these altercations and now we just have this kind of mundane lives where you go to work and sitting in front of computer and we're so we have like this mild just adrenaline like anxiety all.

Speaker 5:          02:14:32       I totally think that's part of it. I think the, the people that I know that have the least amount of that or people that engage in a lot of martial arts, like my, most of my friends that do Jujitsu, I liked the calmest, easiest going people to be around because they're just constantly doing that. It's a, it becomes a part of their every day life. This sort of like physical struggle so that they don't need it and they don't look for it in other ways and their body doesn't look for it. That that sort of like constant buzz of anxiety could easily be attributed to not blowing it out of your system, not exercising your system, sort of like a sexual thing all the time. Sitting, sitting is terrible for you. Horrible. Kelly start one of the guys that I've had on my podcast, he's a, I'm a strength and conditioning specialist specialist and he's got a phd in something Super Smart and uh, he was explaining, he a doctor and he's explaining how the sitting is the new smoking.

Speaker 5:          02:15:22       Like what's terrible for your body and your spine, your back. Like, people are like slumped over and you know, like terrible posture and push all these pressure, this pressure on your discs. They've either found that girls in north, not girls, people in North Korea are getting, um, disc issues because of phones because they're looking down all the time. And so they're getting bulging discs in the back of their neck because of their fucking, their, their posture, their constant posture. Here's something crazy. Weed is legal in North Korea. Wow. Yeah, I heard that. I heard that. I blocked it out.

Speaker 3:          02:15:55       Such a weird thing that doesn't drive with [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          02:15:57       I think we know about. Yeah. But if you smell good, they eat you. They serve you to their political prisoners. Maybe that's why they act the way they are because they're just super, everyone's just super stone. Completely high. Everyone's out to get him

Speaker 7:          02:16:11       fucking tooth is Riley.

Speaker 5:          02:16:14       Yeah. Can I grab it? Yeah. Did you ever seen that? Um, vice special on a North Korea when they went to North Korea? Tons. Rodman. That was so weird. It was so weird. One of the strangest happened. He's like, I just wanted to say behalf of my country.

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       You're like, why is Dennis Rodman's did you want me out of the country? Got sure. Go for it. Well, interesting. It was cool. If you had to choose 10 people, he definitely be there. 10 people to represent the U S I mean, I thought it was

Speaker 3:          02:16:41       cool that he, he, yeah, it was, it was fascinating that the, like the Harlem Globe trotters would go there and be like, I was just bizarre.

Speaker 1:          02:16:48       Well, he's a big basketball fan and the new, the young, the young guy who's running things is, he's fairly young. Let's see. He's like the 15 I think he's older than that, but uh, I think he's fairly young. How old is it, Kim Jong now he can't see. That's the thing. I can't tell the age. Oh, are you being raised?

Speaker 1:          02:17:08       No, that's a compliment. Kim. Jon Did it too. Oh my God. He's 29 years old. He Shit. That's so crazy. It looks a lot younger. Wow. That's still extremely young. He's 29 years old. Weapon runs the country, got nukes. That's kind of, that might be one of the craziest things I've ever read that a 29 year old would be able to run a country with nuclear bombs, a military dictatorship with nuclear bombs. He's, the supreme leader says what it says here, Kim Jong Un is a supreme leader, son of Kim Jong Il and the grandson of Kim, he sung, Whoa, where are we live in strange times.

Speaker 3:          02:17:48       Yeah. But then you know, I've, I've actually got my horizons had been brought in about North Korea a lot because I've realized that there's a lot of disinformation about why the country is the way it is and it has a lot to do with the Korean War, which is something we very, we know very little about and why there's a demilitarized zone and why really has a lot to do with, with a u s policy kind of forcing them into this fortress like mentality that they feel like they have to act like they're going to use nuclear bombs on, otherwise we're going to fucking take 'em out. So it's almost like a self preservation. I mean, I'm not justifying it. I'm just saying, you know, it's kind of these last remaining independent states in the world who aren't completely overtaken by hegemony, need to either act like they have nuclear bombs and they're gonna use them or they're going to get fucking taken out. Look at Libya, Iraq, serious in the, you know, the cross hairs. Now

Speaker 1:          02:18:37       what do you think, I mean, you're, you're a person who pays way more attention to the political atmosphere than I am. What do you think's going to happen in the next 10, 20 years? If you had to guess, how do you think this is all gonna play out?

Speaker 3:          02:18:48       I think that arrogant empires always fall and we definitely are living in one. Um, and we need, unless we scale back, unless something happens within the u s to try to maintain and preserve this country from collapsing, I think we're going to see, uh, some fucked up shit go on in the Middle East. We're, we're driving such instability in the Middle East. If you look back at US policy, you know, we look at the Middle East is like this clash of civilizations and we're kind of trained to say, oh these people are barbaric, they're so behind where the western world is. But really ignoring the fact that the US had been propping up military dictatorships and Mubarak and sponsoring his, you know, militarism for the last 50 years and it also in Afghanistan were the ones who radicalized Islam there and propped up in Lawton. And I mean where would those countries be if it weren't for us kind of suppressing that growth and evolution in those cultures.

Speaker 3:          02:19:40       And it's really turned them more Islamic and more like radical and that in that, right. So I think that we've really cultivated this schism in the region that's, that's created a lot of this instability and like look at a rock. It's a fucking civil war. Why? Because we fucked up the country, we fucked that shit up for 10 years and we just bounce and we're like, whatever, your rocks just fucked. And then it's on the border of Syria in Syria is doing the same thing. I mean it's a mess and it's, it's a shame. I hope that it doesn't. I see it going into a full on civil war there in Iraq and Syria and it just depends on what the u s going to do because the u s paves the way in terms of road policy. So I don't think Obama wants to get involved in Syria. I think he's trying to do everything you can and not, but I think there's a lot of pressure from a lot of people to get in there. Oh, but that's going to be

Speaker 5:          02:20:31       fucking deal. More wars, more whores, dude in fucking God. More wars. You know, we had Dan Carlin on from hardcore history. You ever listen to that podcast? I have heard about it. Fucking amazing. One of his most bad ass podcast is about the goals. And he told a story about how the Mongols invaded Iraq and the 12 hundreds and essentially it never covered the killed. Everybody killed everybody through all their work into the ocean or into the river. The river was black with ink and red with blood and like they just slaughtered the town. And they said that this was in the 12 hundreds and he was talking about how scholars have argued that. And today, like even in 2013 never really recovered, sort of recovered a little bit, but it was always like, it was at one point in time, it was one of the highest levels of, of, of culture and intellect in the world. Like the, the Islamic world had many scientists, many scholars, many poets and all these different, really an intelligent and well respected people as far as the intellectuals of the day. They killed all of them. They killed all of them. They threw all their work into the river. They, the literally wiped out the town and all that they learned and all of they had accumulated all of that. The Mongols just destroyed it all. Yeah. And then we came along, you know, 2000 whatever. And one more time just to the ground again.

Speaker 3:          02:21:49       I mean, he ran one point, yeah. 3000 year old Persian empire. Um, and we, and it's, it's facing extinction. I mean we can weave, we can decide whether or not we're going to completely fuck up that, that region, the world. But yeah, I mean a rock and then the looting of all these ancient, um, libraries and museums there. I mean, all these ancient artifacts. And then look at Lebanon, another birthplace of civilization. We just like Israel just bomb the shit out of it and just fucking destroyed it. I mean, it's just unbelievable. We should be protecting these sites, but I guess we're a little bit too short sided to give a shit.

Speaker 5:          02:22:24       Well, it's, it's just s I

Speaker 4:          02:22:26       think it's a really strange time as far as our ability to influence events and to change the world and our ability to physically impact the world and are sort of our, or our ability to have evolved to the point where we know that that's not a good idea. It's almost like our, our ability to create movement and to create events is far greater than our ability to recognize the impact of these events. What do you think this is all about? Do you think that it's, it's just an a sheen that's kind of operating almost on its own in terms of perpetual warfare in the military industrial complex, not being able to be scaled down and just like the enormous growth and you know, need to just attain more and more power. And what, where, what is that?

Speaker 5:          02:23:08       Well, it seems like that kind of a thing is a trend for human beings that when they get into a position of power, they try to keep pushing it. They don't scale back. They don't, they don't never see her. They never get comfortable with their salary. They always want advances. They always are. They always want bonuses. They always want more money and they want every year they want to raise and we want to continue to move forward and forward. And we see that happen where people cut corners or, and people in positions with extreme power, they can manipulate the actual laws themselves in order to allow them to do things that maybe most people wouldn't agree to. But it's sort of the same, in my opinion, at least the same sort of process or the same sort of pattern that exists throughout the human race. When people get into a position of power, they tend to push it. That's just what we do. When we, when a guy becomes the sheriff and a town and he's got corrupt tendencies, he starts to control the town. And when, you know,

Speaker 4:          02:24:07       yeah, it's just like t when the technology exists, it will be abused by people almost until the

Speaker 5:          02:24:14       pinning of the big mind. And I think if there's anything that's going to save people, it's the opening of the big mind and what I believed the opening of the big mind is that we're going to eventually come to a point in the very near future, 2030 whatever years. I don't want to gas, but what we share consciousness, not just be able to email each other, but literally I can get inside the Abbey. Martin said, I can understand. You can get inside of my head. You can get inside of his head and then you're gonna kill yourself.

Speaker 4:          02:24:39       Once you get into his head, you're going to go, this is, I didn't even know these people like this out there. Fucking shitty videos plungers and all sorts of shit. He didn't even think it fit in your ass and it's just the the point. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          02:24:51       things that I think that if there's any trend that seems to me to be inevitable, this is two and one is the things are gonna progress. They're going to always, there's going to be a faster laptop next year if the cars are going to get more gas mileage and go zero to 60 quicker and your phone's going to be lighter and stronger and it just keeps coming up that

Speaker 4:          02:25:09       he's to have a problem with that plan. Obsolescence, obsolescence though that we have this system that knows 20 years down the road, the model that they're going to release in 20 years and then releasing these antiquated models year after year so you can just buy the newest version of them. I don't know how much

Speaker 5:          02:25:24       of that is real because I think that in an environment is competitive as the one we experienced today. I think eventually the cream rises to the top and the competition is so strong. Like let's put the smartphone market for an example to develop a smart for phone, get it approved by the FTC, then release it. I'm not sure who's holding back shit. I don't know if they really are. I don't know if it's a simple matter of you have to get things approved or this is just what they can do on a mass level now. And if you'd like say if like it's like Samsung Galaxy s four or some shit like that. One of the newest android phones. I pretty sure that's about as good as they can do right now. I don't think they're really holding anything back, but they also know that six months from now that's going to be dog shit because this is going to be an help me.

Speaker 5:          02:26:08       It'll be one phone that you press a button. It makes a Princess Leia Hologram, you know, I mean that's going to happen. There's this dude from a, there's a place in, um, I think it's Marina del Ray. It's called just cause it's a and an emotion capture thing. Just do named Ruben who took us and showed us how to use this motion capture shit. And one of the things that they showed was that they can take you, you put on a suit and then they put, instead of you being Abby Martin, you're a giant dinosaur or your a spaceman or your a wolverine, you know, they can just make you whatever you want inside this game. Yeah, yeah. Without a doubt. So there's gonna be a phone within our lifetime. They're going to bring up press a button and you're going to be able to appear in a Princess Leia outfit and you're going to, you're going to be able to say, help me Obi one my only hope, you mean you could literally be a three d hologram. We are definitely going to have virtual reality with reality. But wait, when you're talking to is planned obsolescence.

Speaker 3:          02:27:03       Well it's good. I get the sharing of consciousness thing cause I don't understand how that would work as how can you really,

Speaker 5:          02:27:07       I don't either conscious or we're fucked. I don't think it's isolated consciousness. I think it's accessing, I think it's the ability to access information and the ability to access thoughts. I think one of the first steps, and this is completely hypothetical, folks, people that are screaming on science forums, this is not possible. You fucking idiot. You're right. We're just talking shit here. Okay, relax. But I think one of the things that's probably going to happen is it gonna be able to record memories. They're going to be able to put a hard drive in your mind somewhere in your system that can record your memories more accurately than your own memory, Ken. And that will act as our new memory. It's so sort of how, like you can't really remember that many phones, phone numbers anymore because they're all stored in your cell phone. I know like four or five numbers and that's it. Once those are done, they're out of my system. But I think that we're eventually going to be able to get a, uh, a version of your memory that's going to be an artificial recording that's in like an HD. That's absolutely perfect. Wait,

Speaker 3:          02:28:04       no, then that's, that's incredible. But they already are doing studies where they can, they have like analogs and cataloging dream sequences and almost like deciphering different shapes of people of what people are dreaming. It's really rough right now, but the technology's there and it's definitely developing. So that's, that's to fucking revolutionize shit right there. Those are dreams to be able to be recorded. Hitting me.

Speaker 5:          02:28:27       There was a woman, um, I think, I'm trying to figure convicted on her memory. There was a woman, um, it was in another country. Okay. Women's center. There was a woman who was accused of a crime and they called her into court and tried this test on her fucking FTM. I forget what it's called. They, um, they figured out how to register or, or to access her memories. And in those memories they determined that she had a personal knowledge of the crime and that they couldn't prove that she had actually committed the crime. They couldn't prove whether she was a witness, but she said she wasn't even anywhere near. And they proved that she had a personal knowledge of the crime. Now.

Speaker 3:          02:29:14       Bob Murray Basin had nothing to do with like,

Speaker 5:          02:29:16       yes, like lie detector technology or no, no. Straight up. Yeah. It's somehow or another they're accessing memory. Let me see. I'm trying to Google the correct things. Yeah. Somebody uh, showed it to me the other than that it was, it's really crazy. This, um, I don't, I don't have the store in front of me. Next podcast. I'll find it folks and I'll get it to you and shit fucks

Speaker 11:         02:29:38       you do 300 podcasts. I don't even know where this is. You fucking asshole. How about your fucking research ship? Before you talk about it,

Speaker 5:          02:29:44       somebody showed it to me. I'm assuming it's real. You. I'm sure you, you smart cats. We'll send it to me on Twitter. Did you hear about the cops and Detroit robbing people? Real cops? There were real crops. What are we in fucking Gotham city? Well, Detroit Kinda is Detroit's way scarier than Gotham city. Detroit is. We were just there really with the film. The TV show does log island thought Zug Island is where they make a lot of cars. It's, it's mostly like a steel factory in plant. And uh, when we were there, we saw houses that were like 50 bucks, cause we, we saw found one on one and it was 39. Yeah, $39 for a house. No regular is there 500. There's a lot of $500 houses there. You just get it out. But you wouldn't want to live there. Like they would have to pay you to live there. It smells horrible. Like it, like a sulfury burning chemical. He smell and it's just in the air all the time. And people were s they were fishing in this polluted river. And uh, my friend was like, why are they efficient in that river? It's like, because they need to eat. Like it's really that crazy 47% illiteracy rate, the highest rate I believe of abandoned houses, like the growth of abandoned houses in the nation. Pretty sure I read that too. I might've made that up though.

Speaker 3:          02:30:57       But yeah, we can't, and I'm not an, let me preempt this by saying I'm not advocating bailing out cities, but it is just funny that the government's like, oh, we can't help you. We're going to fucking take all the pensions, but at the same time we're just going to bail out giant corporations and fuck it, maintain 900 bases around the world and spend trillions of dollars fucking maintaining this empire basis. But it's a, but we're just going to neglect all the cities and yes, there was a lot of corruption in Detroit. Yes. There's a lot of externalities that I'm not taking into consideration. It's just an interesting dichotomy of who the fuck does this government really care about?

Speaker 1:          02:31:30       And again, it brings us full circle to porn. Nobody bailed out at all. Nobody comes for a circle to my neighborhood was a porn guy, lost his fucking house. Bullshit, man. Nobody cared. You're trying to try and get them moved to Detroit. Yeah. All the people who lost out in the porn industry in Detroit, free taxes and those people, fuck you for cheap. They're willing to eat radioactive fish though. Fuck you on the cheap.

Speaker 2:          02:31:58       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:31:59       That's a good move. This is the end of the show. Clearly we ran out of gas. I'm going to pee. You guys talk amongst yourselves and then we'll wrap this up. I'll come back and we'll clean it up tight. Oh yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:32:12       Dry wants to see it. Show up on snap went off. So what are these little lamps do? There's Salt Himalayan salt lamps. Supposedly they have some kind of energy that comes off of him, but I don't buy it, I think was just a hippie closeted hippie. So they're actually made of salt.

Speaker 4:          02:32:31       Yeah, they're made out of salt. Crazy. Um, so your artwork, you do, do you also have like a, like a gallery or do you have a any online where you can buy posters over your, over your stuff.org?

Speaker 3:          02:32:44       I'd be mark and check out the gallery there and a, I just brought something that I thought you guys would like here. But yeah, I do a lot of like abstract art and political art as well. Oh, that's cool. Yeah. Did you go to school for art or no? No, I think art school is kind of bullshit. Yeah, it's kind of conforms. You knew what they, whatever they think artists or whatever. So our, it just started off as mostly a go into the collage section right there.

Speaker 2:          02:33:11       Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:33:12       It started off as just mostly an outlet because political activism was dominating my life, but then it,

Speaker 2:          02:33:17       okay.

Speaker 3:          02:33:18       It ended up being something that I was able to bridge the two together and it just, it keeps me sane. I don't get to do it as much as I would like to. But, and what is, is this, what is this medium you're using as ink? That is all paint pen and cutouts of paper. I do nothing on the computer, so that's all just hand drawn ink and, and collage has really cool paint pen. Thank you.

Speaker 4:          02:33:41       Now do you ever do a live gallery or do you ever have, have you ever done that? Like a, like a showing of your year?

Speaker 3:          02:33:47       Oh yeah, absolutely. I did a lot of art shows in the past and I did my first political installation. That's a line of riot cops I took a photo of. And then just drew over it. What did I miss? I miss a lot of shit, dude. Your style

Speaker 4:          02:34:00       did I miss out? We're looking@herartworkatabbymartin.org

Speaker 1:          02:34:04       I love when a, I don't know something about somebody. It turns out they're bad acid shit. Yeah, that's pretty sweet. Like finding that you have to look at here. Bad ass artist. What's the video? Cool. Use it. Yes. Okay,

Speaker 3:          02:34:18       so this is a little compilation promo that I made of what I think are the best clips of the entire first season of breaking this set, which is the show I have on rt America. So this is kind of just a little two minute a preview of what the fuck the show's about. Okay. Check it out.

Speaker 2:          02:34:33       Hmm.

Speaker 12:         02:34:34       Media candidates, corporate talk. Cracy how rude. You can't wait for this

Speaker 13:         02:34:39       to be over word New York Times. Welcome to the, this administration has no credibility club. Remind me again, why does that people are worshiping kings and Queens in the year 2013 five novel idea. I'm blaming the whistleblower for trying to evade death by way of the espionage act. You actually talk about what the NSA revelations are in a counselor's republic democracy. This is not informed consent by those who are governed. This is manufacturer consent and I would actually argue it's core is consent in secret. Guys, this is not about safety. It's not about terrorism. This is about shilling descent and controlling society. Live, live, die, die, die. Is he dead already? You can't conduct these kinds of wars around the world, killing innocent people in the pursuit of a few bad guys and pretend that it's not going to come back to, to hurt you. Did you find the logic flawed?

Speaker 13:         02:35:31       Now looking back, do you regret your vote to invade, not occupy a country to find one man? See, we ought to be critical of highly concentrated forms of power wherever we find it, because that kind of power was usually subject of chronic abuse. Hello, I'm Stephanie from Nestle. We sold a video. You post on youtube criticizing this Nestle over water. So He's all response. Walmart's also been described as an economic deathstar destroying everything in its path. Ligon behind nothing more than homogenous wasteland. So the harmless activist is now the criminal yet actual criminal banksters run free. Well, I'm glad this government has its priorities straight. So do you shackled down your mind and subscribe to old school paradigms or do you liberate yourself by acknowledging reality? Sure, the world would lose its innocence, but wouldn't you rather know the truth?

Speaker 1:          02:36:35       Powerful. Abby Martin, you're all angry and shit. I'm all pissed. You like causing a revolution or something. I'm just pissed. And you don't see people who are like, yeah, don't, but Archie allows you to be pissed, but I should say that you're very pleasant. You know by saying you're angry, you're kind of angry when you're doing these clips. If someone didn't know you and they saw that, they would think like, wow, this is like really intense check. But you're very pleasant. You're very normal.

Speaker 3:          02:36:57       That's funny. It is funny that you say that because everyone I've met, they're like, wow, you look, do you seem like you're really intense? And I'm like, oh, just yeah, I'm pissed off when I'm talking about the shit. But I could also be a normal person who can have conversations about different things. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:37:10       Ultimately it all boils down to you can't deny what's going on and so many people are and if it's not for people like you that come up and go, hey, quite honestly what the fuck is happening if that doesn't happen. It's a real controversial thing and I applaud you and this is going to sound condescending, but it's, I have to say it this way anyway. I applaud you for doing it even more because you're a woman because I know that a lot of men don't want to hear women talk about important issues. There's a weird thing like especially old school, he type men. Like if you're like how many dudes in their 50s one to listen to some, how will the you like 29 or something like that. Yeah, 29 year old chick fucking smart mouth talking shit about our military or whatever. You know, like they don't want to hear that shit like old dudes don't want to hear that at all.

Speaker 1:          02:37:57       So it takes a lot of balls or whatever you have ovaries. It takes a lot of ovaries. It takes a lot of courage to, uh, to be able to do that. It's a tricky situation when you start talking about shit that other people should have taken care of. It's like, cause you're not just saying to old dude's like, hey dickhead, you know, like you paying attention to what's going on. Like this is what the government is doing to you. You're also saying, hey, how did you let this happen? You were the ones that were in truck. What are you doing that accident? You were like, you were the ones who are in charge of this. Like you guys allowed this to happen. Like, and anybody that's upset at the way the situation is right now, who had anything to do with it, look at yourself, look at yourself. Don't get mad at Edward Snowden.

Speaker 3:          02:38:38       Yeah. And I think, you know, people have told me that I'm, you know, why don't you provide more solutions or you're like me fearmongering and stuff. I'm like, look, we all need to get this information first before we can even get to what we can do about it. Like, we don't fucking know any of this shit because we've been conditioned to not knowing it. The media is controlled by six corporations, six corporations that work in concert with the establishment to push their narrative. Six corporations that have about 120 people sit on the boards of directors of that also sit on the board of directors of defense contractors, Monsanto. I mean, this is what's controlling. That's the corporatocracy. The media is allowed to lie. It's about entertainment. It's not about providing information. So it's, it's a shame that I have to work for Russian government to provide the truth about my own country. And it's a shame that there's no outlet here that will allow me to do that.

Speaker 1:          02:39:27       It's amazing that this is like when we think about Russia, when you think about Putin, you think about like, oh, don't piss that fucking guy off. Like the, those people are crazy. Like those people are gangster as fuck. But uh, we don't think about that when it comes to this country. Right? But meanwhile, you look at what the fuck is going on. I'm like, look at this. The Edward Snowden thing is a classic situation. They're offering political asylum to guy that exposed a worldwide spying program. Who else? A spine because the UK spine, their spine to China spine. Everyone's spine. What's going on? I got Kathleen and fucking like Brazilians. It's like, why the fuck are we spine on? Brazilians never know that ass [inaudible] they they find out about you husker. He has he ever eat a full go to Sean. I read it. One of those places. That's how I supposed to say if your culture, by the way you don't say Chao Fogo de Chao, you don't say that. You say Sean,

Speaker 4:          02:40:23       but it's true. Acting like, oh, it's a thumb in the eye at the middle finger of the u s well, actually the u s set the double standard years ago when we denied repeated extradition requests of actual criminals from Russia, Russia has fucking asses to extradite multiple criminals and we said, no. Yeah, Ecuador. Venezuela. Yeah, but we didn't want to write. That's a, why are we acting shocked when other countries don't do it? Why are we acting so shocked when Russia is like, no, we're not going to extradite this guy. Isn't it funny that we keep saying we? Yeah, I need to stop doing.

Speaker 1:          02:40:52       I tried it too, but it's so easy to do. So easy to go. We're the ones who write. That's what pisses people off though.

Speaker 4:          02:40:58       I know. They're like, don't call it. We'd say, well, okay, it's somebody. Yeah, this should, yeah, it should be a better account of what the fuck we stands for. Yeah. It's like I'm sick of just saying like the US government. This,

Speaker 1:          02:41:11       that's the real problem with like conspiracy theory type talk. The government is trying to, how much of the government, because the government itself, it's the IRS, the CIA, the FBI and the NSA.

Speaker 4:          02:41:21       A lot of them which don't even like each other. Even though we have, it's not us necessarily doing it. We are sponsoring it with our tax dollars, so it really is. We in a general sense. Sure.

Speaker 1:          02:41:31       In a very general surgery general, we think of like responsibility for the actual action itself and then we say, we did this and Afghanistan, we did this and that. Right. I didn't fucking slaughter any Afghanis or it's, it gets real tricky when you get into the weeds. Strange Times. That'd be Martin to think about that like your historically to be a reporter. This is one of the weirdest times ever. It's one of the weirdest times ever to to be witnessing sort of a society boiling. I guess though the, the, their statement holds true that every time was the weirdest time for that time. Right, right. But this is the weirdest time ever.

Speaker 4:          02:42:07       Yeah. I, I think about that a lot. I think because of the advancement of technology and the fact that we are so interconnected and know about all the horrible shit going on at any given time, does it just seem like it's so much poor fucked up now because we have access to all of that. We get like an AP newser when everything horrible happened. It's like, I don't know. Or is there really more like horrible shit going on? I don't know. Well, we definitely have more if you hear that. It's not me paying for corn, a little coffee. I think we definitely have. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:42:32       more access. There's no question about that. And so we're going to hear more stories about things that have happened, but I, I wish I knew how much of it's, it's how much of it is actually how much of it is affecting the actual things that we, we

Speaker 4:          02:42:44       do, I don't know about. Well, that's the problem is all we hear on the corporate media shit, that doesn't affect us. Jodi Arias, case, Zimmerman. I mean, in the grand scheme of things, you can argue that yes, the stand your ground laws definitely affect people. But did it warrant that much coverage for weeks and weeks and weeks and every detail of the case. Now, here's a perfect example today. Think about all the shit that's going on in the world today. I mean, there's giant chunks. Manhattan size or falling off a fucking Greenland, that huge

Speaker 1:          02:43:12       chunks of ice, right? We all know about that. We all know about this Bradley manning thing. We all know about this Edward Snowden thing. We all know about what the fuck is going on with Iran. What's happening with North Korea. We all know about that. But the front page of CNN, I'm fighting for my life. It's a ride because he's suspended for a year. You know what? He only has $270 million. What will he do if he is forced to take a heat a whole year off for using roads? Fucking bad for him to stop what you're saying or what are you a communist? This is front page news for a reason. Cause this is the most important story in America. A rod suspended, but in lineup during appeal. So he's allowed to go into law so we can go, this is, how is this going to play out? It's going to kind of watch it. Grand drama

Speaker 3:          02:44:04       as fuck. You know what terrified me is I vice is so awesome. I love that you've been interviewing as Shane Smith. Yeah, he's, he's awesome dude. This oh wow. Great column and taking rides to um, whew. Wow. No. But the Fenix, the Venice one where he was like, Venice is underwater. Holy Shit. Like underwater for a hundred days out of the year. It's just, that's how much the oceans rising right now. So it's like the people who are much is accessible. Um, they've just built bridges all over, so people just walk on these platforms all over the city. Wow. A hundred days of the year, it's totally flooded. So it is, is it rising? Like how much of a difference is it from before it's been progressively rising and Shane Smith is just like, look, these people who are arguing about is global warming, manmade is climate change payment. It doesn't fucking matter. It's happening now. We don't need to have the argument about fucking who did it. Yeah. Yeah. Shit's fucked up and bullshit. What do we do about it? That's a quote somewhere in the bottom of a message board now. That'd be more him chips fucked up. That's going to be in a bottle. The cork bottle. A real good point. There was an article

Speaker 1:          02:45:07       Miami, they were talking about Miami and within the decade we'll be underwater. They're like, you can't stop it. Also because Miami apparently is on like I very porous limestone. It's not hard ground cause it's like, it's not just at sea level. It's like a giant sponge. Great. So they were saying that like it's gonna be, it's gonna be crazy. Like it's all just going to be a marsh. Like you're, you're not gonna be able to get here.

Speaker 3:          02:45:28       Mondo. I think the problem with the whole argument is people like Al Gore who are actually profiting off the solutions, the carbon credit thing. I think it's bullshit. Um, you can't trade pollution and somehow think that's going to be fucking in the answer. So I think, and then when you see things like, uh, the meat industry not getting penalized for the fact that they are creating the majority of carbon output. So this is a meat industry that's doing that. The methane coming from far farther. So, so the methane from cow farts are the biggest problem the world's ever known. I think it's a large percentage of, of carbon emissions. But the fact that we're not even talking about that, it's like the, you know, the burdens put on the consumer where we're like calculate your carbon footprint. I think people like what the fuck?

Speaker 1:          02:46:11       Yeah. We need to put cups over the back of cows. Bucks, tape those bitches down and capture all that methane. Just capture it. You know what? Put them in the Dome like that Stephen King Book put all the cows inside of the dome. Is that one of those cows? It has a, um, is that we'll get the balls. Jesus Christ the size, that fucking bull. Um, they could capture it. Why can't they capture it and you can, they figure out a way to like dome them cows in and suck all the mess.

Speaker 4:          02:46:41       You could put a man in orbit in the space station floating

Speaker 1:          02:46:45       above the planet and he could fucking Twitter from up there. You tell me you can't dome up a few cows and suck them farts. Turn them in the resources. Isn't that possible? It seems like he's pretty positive. It should be, right? Yeah. If we can figure out to do satellites, we should be able to figure out a suck methane out of the air, out of cows, asses the future gloomy or Rosie? Abby Martin.

Speaker 3:          02:47:07       I think it depends on your

Speaker 4:          02:47:09       perspective. I hate people who are like, oh, I don't look at positive or negative news because I was pushing of your grandma. I now look at news cause it makes me sad. I don't have, oh, I'm just really positive. I just like don't, oh no, that's just too negative. It's like, well this is fucking reality. So you're going to intake reality

Speaker 3:          02:47:26       and figure out how you're going to relay your own message of what reality is like. That's fucking truth. So if you're going to reject a whole portion of the world because you don't want to fucking be negative, then I didn't really answer your question. I think

Speaker 1:          02:47:38       either way it does. It's your, you're just sort of hedging your bets. Yeah. Yeah. It can go either way. Right. Do you think, do you have a responsibility being in a position where people are listening to you to talk about certain things?

Speaker 3:          02:47:50       Uh, I think, yeah, I mean I think I have the resources and natural does it mean I had compassion for the law. I started off as an anti war activist and then it just went from there realizing all this shit was censored. Why is it sensored? And I'm getting into media and so I've been passionate about this stuff for, since I was 17, you know, out in the streets doing activism.

Speaker 1:          02:48:11       You were in the streets at 17. What are you doing out there

Speaker 3:          02:48:14       fucking trying to lobby against is not blowing you rock up

Speaker 1:          02:48:17       when you were 17. Yeah. Wow. How many people listened? They're like, bitch, come on. You're fucking 17. How many people listen to 17 year olds? Yeah. So unfortunate and aspect.

Speaker 3:          02:48:32       Well, what's crazy is that there was millions of people in the street saying the same thing, but we were at Norton.

Speaker 1:          02:48:36       Um, when you see like a occupy Wall Street and shit like that, do you think that that has positive effect? Absolutely. I think so. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:48:44       I think that it really got the, uh, the debate into the 99% versus the 1% kind of realizing that we all have so many problems and when people demonized occupy and saying, oh you guys can't get a consolidated message, what the fuck is this all about? It's like, well there's fucking 99 problems and a bitch ain't one. But no, I mean there seriously so many problems facing I was, it all stems the same system so I don't blame the Movement for not galvanizing behind one message. The problem with occupies, it was so inclusive that would be like homeless people would be doing open mics and shit.

Speaker 6:          02:49:19       Mike check. So like it's like, dude, you can't mark chart number. Everyone's like Mike check and you're like, I need a sip.

Speaker 1:          02:49:31       Well there was a cultural aspect to the whole occupy thing that got little strange and that was that Mike check thing that people would do that like in courthouses, Mike checking in, people will like yell it out. It was very military.

Speaker 3:          02:49:42       I think there needs to be some sort of leadership, you know? But then again, I think that there needs to be, if we had like a true democracy would be, uh, and I think if we had people actually having democratic input, but the thing is we don't have that. We have like what one delegate that can go and fucking the electoral college is bullshit. We don't even have like direct representation. So it's just, it was a good concept and I think it's the start of it, you know, it was cracked down brutally by militarized riot police all across the country on a federal level. I saw it firsthand. I was in Oakland living there and there's a fucking police state dude. I was like, why are you guys expelling so many resources to shut down at a little camp of like a hundred people? It was like fucking a thousand police full riot riot gear. I like treating it like a riot. Like I don't understand if you have, if you're dressed as a paramilitary troop, um, I don't understand why you need to be, uh, using these crowd control methods if, if there's no right. It's like, I don't know. It's just bizarre.

Speaker 1:          02:50:44       Fart in the new generation. It's part of what it always is going to be. There's always going to be a resisting of change and try and fight back. The angry hoards. I mean this is very similar to

Speaker 3:          02:50:54       dress like a troop. You're going to act like a fucking soldier.

Speaker 1:          02:50:57       You know what? I have described it as like an enemy. I've described operation or occupy Wall Street as being sort of like white blood cells like there, they're going around the infected area. They don't know what the fuck they're going to do, what they're, they're making it inflamed. They're causing attention. Like when you get an infection on your knee and you look down at your knees swollen, that's sort of like white blood cells and occupy Wall Street. He looked down and this, these areas where these people camped out and screaming and yelling and doing mic checks all day and like that's inflammation. You've got an, you got an inflammation spot, you've got a sore, you got a dirty little store right there.

Speaker 3:          02:51:30       It's, it's for there for a reason. So future. Rosie, can we say Rosie? Yeah. Possibly. Possibly Rosie get worse before it gets better. But I have faith in humanity and I think that we can pull things around and I wouldn't be doing what I'm doing if I didn't believe that. Do you like working for our tea? I do. I have an amazing amount of editorial control over. What do you say that you like working for Russia? It's a pretty fucked up world, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. It just, it's just twisted. It's like I never thought that I'd just right and right is left to tell the truth. That's crazy powerful. Poff Abby Martin,
