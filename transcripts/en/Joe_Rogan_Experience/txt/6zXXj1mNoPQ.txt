Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Four three, two,

Speaker 2:          00:00:04       one

Speaker 1:          00:00:07       oh and the sweet, sweet sound of amplified voices. And my man shooter Jennings, Gee man, you look like you're supposed to wear sunglasses. Some dudes wear sunglasses, you know, like pitch, get those sunglasses off, but you, you look like you're supposed to be wearing sunglasses. There is a point in time when I moved here, uh, I remember well for a while they were a prescription. So I had an excuse for a long time that I went back to contacts. But there was a point in time when I, I remember turning to my friend, I was like 21, and I was like, I think I'm just going to keep them on all the time and then it'll just be a thing. And that way I can just, if I have to close my eyes and nobody will notice or if I'm stoned, nobody will notice. When people get super famous like Jay z famous, they were um, inside everywhere, just so people don't catch a glimpse of their eyes handed him a demo tape.

Speaker 1:          00:00:56       Can you start out like a scrub wearing them then? Then it's weird if you take them off, you know. Well it's a different thing in the black community to um, like a real cool black artist is just a loud, they're just allowed. They can just do it. Right, right. I mean I'd be disappointed if like I saw Bob Dylan out somewhere and he wasn't wearing them like Christoper retires and all the time. Yeah, good fade too. It's like black, Brown, white Kinda. Yeah, he fits right. The fuck and conor Mcgregor, he can wear them indoors. Oh yeah. Some dudes can where I'm endorsed by warm and doors, I'd be a Douche bag plus the kind of where I where like you know, fucking sport ones. I have a couple pairs of those that look cool. Cool ass aviator tiny. These are in Porsche's. My Dad used to wear a porsches in like 9.9 I ran across their purple ones and I was like, I bought like four pairs and I keep breaking them in is my last one.

Speaker 1:          00:01:44       Those are very dope. Those are porsche design. They make some dope shit. They do. I just used to think that they only made cars and then uh, I felt they make phones. Did you know anything like a phone? Oh yeah, I saw it. I've never don't they make, didn't they make a blackberry for a minute? They think maybe made a blackberry and I think they made another phone recently. I would love to get one of those. But it's a weird little design chop they have. It is a walway phone. I'm, I'm saying it wrong apparently people correct me. Huawei, Paul. While ways a Chinese company that actually just got busted because their newest advertisement, it shows them taking selfies, but there aren't really taking selfies. They use only a super high end dslr camera that to take the photo and they're passing it off as if these people were just holding it up, taking selfies. It's on a fucking tripod, the whole deal. You get a photo of that, look at that look, look, look guys holding it up as if he's taking a selfie. But meanwhile there's a fucking professional doom the tripod. But he's making it look like he took that picture. Who busted then? Ah, I think the woman in the photo busted them cause I think she took pictures or had someone take pictures of the photo shoot. Yeah. You gotta look on her

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       face like that too. She's really, come on. Wow. Way Burmese. Meanwhile, here's what's stupid about that. They don't have to do that. Those goddamn things take amazing selfies. That's a great phone. Like the, the newest, latest smartphones. They take incredible selfies. I know, but people never satisfied with the truth. This is why people, gorgeous women. We'll put those fucking crazy cartoons. They'll selfie filters on. Yeah, they're beautiful. And then they'll, they'll turn themselves into a cartoon. Like you don't get it. Like you're supposed to have pores, right. We don't mind pores. I don't mind the wrinkles in your skin when you smile. I don't mind. You know, the, the, the bubbles of saliva on your teeth. Okay. Would, and people are getting this weird state of mind where they think they're so, you know, they, they said there's an epidemic of girls like insta models that are actually getting surgery to try to look like they look in their selfies.

Speaker 3:          00:03:55       Oh my God. You know, speaking of instant models, I just listened to David spades audio audio book, which I thought was great. The uh, I guess what polaroid guy in a snapchat world or whatever and there's a lot of chapters that deal with the incident. I don't even realize, I didn't even realize this is the thing like adding dude, I am so out of the loop with, with, do you go to instagram? Do you, do you like pay attention to it? He just post pictures occasionally. Man, I, I, I'm not really good at paying attention to any of it. Twitter from day one I kind of was in and I'll go in and out, but it's hard for me to actually keep up and care about it. Like I hate posting pictures of myself and my manager Adam is here. He's always like, dude, if you're going to post something on Instagram, just make sure you're in it or something.

Speaker 3:          00:04:37       Cause I'm always like taking pictures of other people can listen to that dude. That's ridiculous. You can't, you're not supposed to be in every picture you take. That's crazy. I know, but I'm, I'm, I'm bad at it and I'm very bad at caring about other people's pictures too. And it's like, like my wife will be like, I just posted on instagram so I got to go like it. Oh, that's annoying you to talk to her about. Her pictures are good. So I'm, I'm sure they're great, but God damn do I have to double tap each and every one of them just give you the nod. It looks good now we'll see. See, it's easy to throw that off and see. My daughter is now, he's 10 now as an instagram account and if I'm not liking them, I feel horrible. I'm like, I've got my wife's already like him.

Speaker 3:          00:05:15       I'm like, yeah, I think that's a lot of pressure for a kid. It will serve as are all pictures of these lol dolls that she's obsessed with anyway. And slyly slime was a new one, Huh? Yeah, it's crazy. Fucks all that comment by the way. It's fidget spinners out. Yeah. I just find out, I mean my son got so obsessed with fidget spinners and my daughter, but really my son to the point where like they were spending some time in New York and I'd be gone up there and we walked down the street and like every fucking vendor, every newsstand stand, every like pretzel place had like fidget spinners and like I'd have to buy it, you know, it'd be like, he'd be like, Ooh, that one has a skull on it and be like, okay, and it's like 10 bucks and then to spend just a right, that guy in sense to manufacturer in Taiwan, he was like an 18 year old kid who came up with that and he wanted to be an entrepreneur and he made that.

Speaker 3:          00:06:04       Now he's like a billionaire. How did he figure that out? Like I want to talk to that dude. Go, hey man, shit damn on the show. Yeah. Don't, don't give out the secret, but what the fuck is next? I didn't see slime coming either. My daughters have fucking gallons of glue and and, and, and chargers. Yeah. Just yesterday, my daughter and son were making slime with it and I'm, I was saying the same thing. I'm like, man, I mean we had like ectoplasm slime and nickelodeon slime when I was a kid and like all but it was not like this. All of a sudden it's like, uh, I can't believe it. And you watch the commercials for glue. They have glow in the dark glue and they're like showing a kid making slime with the elmer. No. Talk about an unexpected boost for elmers chat. They must have jumped.

Speaker 3:          00:06:49       He wants to jump on tide. They came up timers between tide pods and the slime tides like fucking real. What people really eating detergent real, I guess that seems like it would be unbelievably bad for your body to eat a detergent. We used to huff like Scotch guard when we were kids or Potpourri. I mean maybe it's a smell. Markers. Yeah. I used to love the smell of like a good sharpie, like a fat one. Do the thing in school for you where they grab you and they, they pull you up and then you almost pass out and then they let you go. And we used to do that in elementary school where they, yeah. What was the, how'd that work? I think I would get behind these. You pick it up and then she told you or some shit. Yeah, until you can't basically breathe.

Speaker 3:          00:07:34       You're almost suffocating and then let you go and then you're like, hi. Hi. Hi. Yeah, I don't know. The kids are always trying to, well, even monkeys, man. I mean, animals try to change their state, you know, they, they, they, they think it's just a natural thing. The creatures tried to change your state, change your state of consciousness. Even little kids. But I wonder about that slime stuff because I genuinely, genuinely worry. Like people I don't think had been dealing with large volumes of glue and detergent like that with the physicals too. That's another one. Oh yeah. Borax is, yeah. That's fucking toxic. You think gets in your skin is an organ. People don't realize that. You don't think about that when you spray it on all the different shit that people put on their bodies. Like I think about that when I use sunscreen.

Speaker 3:          00:08:21       I'm like, what is this stuff right here? You're blocking your pores with some Goo, some good. Well, it's also your, your skin's absorbing it. Like, um, like when you go in that isolation tank, that's one of the best ways to absorb magnesium because of the epsom salts. Like when you float around in the tank, the epsom salts, you know, your, your body absorbs magnesium from talking about altered states. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Have you done that before? I still haven't done dmt. We had that conversation. That's right. We haven't had a conversation about how the fuck have we only done one other podcasts together. That's ridiculous. You know, we live in the same town. I know. I know. We went, we had a great dinner. It was dirty. It was fun. My mom. Yeah. That was really fun. Yeah. I got the Great Mrs Rogan out. Yeah, that's right.

Speaker 3:          00:09:01       It was fun. We had a good time. Do that. Places the shit a place like you go back in time. That is my, that is the spot where if they, I feel like I've made it in this town. If they know me by name there and I can always get a spot at the bar. I'm close. They know me by name, but I don't always have a spot at the bar. Um, you can, I don't think anybody always gets a spot. The Pars Woods does. Oh, does he? I bet he's got a giant Dick. I here. Sweet. I bet it seems like it. I finally met him there. I had the balls to walk up to him one of the recent times and I was like, hey man, you know, you just got to walk up with the Hillary Clinton joke. I love video drowned. He's a Republican now.

Speaker 3:          00:09:39       Yeah, but he's, he's, he's, he's funny. I mean, regardless of what side you're on, he is just always on fire with that and he, he likes doing it just to aggravate people. Yeah. Well he see, it seems like he's done with the whole acting thing, right. He, I said he invested in apple in the 80s and he's fine with being blacklisted. Really? Yeah. That's what he said. He bought it. Made a tweet or something like that. The investment in Apple. Yeah. Interesting. Yeah. That's how weird is that? You can just say, I think this company is going to kick some ass. We by piece. Yeah. I think you'd get a piece of a company and then they become the apple. Apple apparently has a more than a trillion dollars now. I know that and then insane. That's kind of dangerous. Anybody to have that kind of influence though with these phones and shit.

Speaker 3:          00:10:25       It's like that's pretty, pretty dangerous. I kind of trust them with data though. I feel like even with they're trying to deal. Yeah. Well Google has a weird trying to deal to, will they also have secret servers in North Korea and shit? Yeah. Well I mean they just have servers set up and all these other countries. All of that up danger cause I didn't trust any of them. What are they doing in north? I don't know. Dick Pics Rovers full of, I think there's all kinds of networks that had been going on for years that are involved in shit. I think I like I was, I, I tell my friends or my drummer specifically I talked to, but I was like, man, I think I like, I'm not a rich guy, but like I think that there's a point of money that I would be, I would like to know the threshold in which you get past that and then like the Saudis and then all the, all these people start coming in wanting a part of you and then you start selling your soul.

Speaker 3:          00:11:16       Like whatever that is. If it's 5 million bucks, I just got to stay right there. That would be, I don't want to get richer than that. Once you have influence, I think it's, it becomes a scary world. So I like, I think there's a lot of concern with people wonder whether or not someone's been like, I've been accused of being approached like that of my cia acid or that I, here's a big one. I think really the flat earth. Oh, the flat earth people, they think that, uh, I've been approached to talk about the earth being round to be around round Earth shill. Jamie started selling tee shirts. Round Earth Shale. James got round earth. She'll tee shirts and he sells@youngjamie.com man, I mean around

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       or the shield shell is like saying like, you know that the Reptilian people went to you to be a human shill. All someone told me that, someone told me that they believe that there's reptilians underneath the earth and that they have a car. They've carved tunnels through the ground with laser beams and to have like a network of tunnels they use, they, they travel amongst us, waiting for their time to expose themselves. People believe like you see someone like safe. You live in an apartment building and he tried by a dude's house, got a fat house. You Go, wow, that guy's got a fat house. I wonder, wonder who he knows. I wonder if he's like he's in with the mob or maybe he's deep with the Democrats or maybe he's the bankers or Cusco. Who's he? Who does he know? Because you always think of like someone like being like at a level where you're, you're you like they sit you in a room and they give you some communications that you're not supposed to expose to the rest of the world.

Speaker 1:          00:12:45       Right. Well, I mean there is again, what I, what I was saying about the threshold of money. There is a point and you know it's there in which in, I mean Google started with a couple of dudes who were like, we got this idea. There was before that there was a thing called web crawler. That was kind of the first experience of, of me of a search engine that I'd ever experienced. Whether there was netscape navigator, wasn't, wasn't one of those, netscape navigator was a, was one of the first Brazil's browser. Yeah, there was a mosaic and netscape navigator, but there was a way to search that was web crouther. Lycos came later who came later, but there was web crawler. Danielle who and like us and then Google never ask jeeves. Yeah. Cool. Yeah. Asked Jesus real thing has.com is still there. It's still there.

Speaker 1:          00:13:30       It's still there. But, uh, but like, you know, you gotta look a couple of dudes in an office, Hey, we got a web search and then all of a sudden they're, they've got con, I mean, Amazon has cia contracts that's known because they use their servers to do things. You got, you got to look, Amazon has like super, super secure servers, but there's still been hacked. They're as secure as anyone else's. They just have, once you make that, I think it's the, maybe it's 500 million, there's gotta be a mark. Yeah. There's a number of ways in which people start approaching you and saying, hey man, you've got too much influence. Would you like to join our group and we'll support you and you'll make a billion. Ooh. And she's level. Yeah. I was in Italy. I just got back and uh, we, uh, took a boat from um, uh, from the Amalfi coast, took a boat from a mall free to Capri, which is an island house.

Speaker 1:          00:14:25       Gorgeous Matte. But when you're there, you see the crazy yachts. Like Steve Jobs has a yacht. Wow. That he had built before he died and now his family owns it. Leo Dicaprio and Bella Hadid and his, his yacht looks like an apple store. It's the craziest thing. I mean we, we, we drove right by it. Yachts are weird too because they're worth like a hundred million bucks, but you could basically look, drive up and smack it like no one has done. There's, it's weird. I mean that's how pirates work, right? You can just hop onto the, throw a grappling hook up and they climb on top of your yacht, but we're driving by, he's got smack it. He's kind of, there it is. That's it. Wow. It's a floating apple store that I don't want to have to deal with that and the maintenance and everything. I'm fine. I would rather just just first class it and a and go to, you know, go on a trip and maybe rent that yacht for like, if I had the money to do it, even renting that I would be like a half a million dollars a week.

Speaker 1:          00:15:22       Oh fuck that. I'll just get a boat and go up to it and write it on. The difference between the experience in a boat, that big and an experience at a boat that's like a fraction of that science is not that different. Like that's pretty fucking awesome. But ultimately it's like a Ho like that's there. You get a good impression of what it's like. It's, it doesn't, it doesn't really do it justice in an image because it's so, it's so modern, right? Like, uh, when you, when you get near it, it's so strange looking. Yeah. I mean, again, it'd be awesome to party on that for like a week. It'll be the best of it would suck. Look at that boat that just pulled right up. Hey Man. Yo Steve, my fucking eye pads, bro. Dude, my fucking ipad just broke.

Speaker 1:          00:16:08       I mean, I don't know man. He, did he ever ride it? No, he, he shit the bed before he wrote it. You know what's really fascinating, I read something about he died of pancreatic cancer and one of the things he did was he drink fruit juice every day and we used to think the fruit juice is really good for you, right? You're drinking fruit now they say, no, no, no fruit. It was really good for you. But drinking fruit juices is kind of an unnatural state. There's no fiber in that. So you're just drinking straight sugar and now they say that drinking like a glass of fresh squeezed orange juice has the same sugar as drinking a can of soda. So you really, your body doesn't differentiate much between chemicals and soda though chemicals are not good, right? Some chemicals, but some of them, they're innocuous. Like you could drink, like I was reading something about like diet coke, like someone was saying like Diet Coke give you brain cancer. And that's her saying that it prevents cancer. What they're there. There was an article I read recently that was saying that they thought that Diet Cola is actually helped it. They flipped their a script on that too. They have a little fast talk at the end of it. It's dot spots.

Speaker 1:          00:17:20       Those fucking, first of all, that fast talk shit should be illegal. I don't know why that's not illegal. Remember they used to do that at the end of those goddamn commercials, they hire somebody who talks like a carnival barker. Whole commercial like that. That'd be awesome man. Yeah. Make it all ineffective here. What does that, um, could die. Coke help curb colon cancer's return. What? Diet coke? Who fucking see new study shows that Colin can, here's the problem, man. Fucking studies dude. Studies are a problem because you, you can get like there was a study posted recently. It was a, a questionnaire that showed that people who eat higher carb diets live longer, but it's, it's basically a questionnaire that over 20 something years of like what you eat and then the people who died, like there was all sorts of problems with it. Like they didn't exercise as much.

Speaker 1:          00:18:13       They were fatter than the people who ate more carbs. And also you're asking people to remember what they ate, which is like very, very ineffective. And then the same cup, the same place, put out a study, um, really recently that showed the exact opposite effect. And so it's like, well, what the fuck if I'm just a regular guy who barely has time to read the paper and I read a study every now and then, it's basically like what you catch, you can catch some second ausas found that about half of the benefit appear to be due to people switching from regular to diet sodas. Oh, so the colon cancer was really just, you stopped drinking coke. Coke was giving you colon cancer. So now diet coke, coke prevents colon cancer. It's really, no coke gives you fucking colon cancer. Right? It's so hard to know. It's so hard to know, man.

Speaker 1:          00:19:01       I try to keep up. I cannot, I try now. That's the problem with the Internet and everything. Back in the day when we just didn't know shit at, seems like things move smoother, you know? Yeah. But you remember like, people thought all kinds of goofy shit. Like thought most of your diet should be bread. I would that food pyramid and took his rib out is on deck now. But that was her. That was a rumor back in the day. The city, no, I met him. He might do, might actually do that. Yeah. Um, yeah, that was one. How about here's the granddaddy of all rumors, Richard Gere and that dribble terrible. Everybody knew that. How is that possible? I want to drum up your ass. Ho It's possible. My Buddy Steve did his residency in Miami. He's a ophthalmologist and he told me that they pulled all kinds of things that a dude's buts and you know, those uh, kind of fic lightening, uh, those thick a light bulbs that look like a, like a tree, like a Christmas tree, right?

Speaker 1:          00:19:53       Yeah. Yeah. Some dude shoved one of those up, his asshole and it broke watch, uh, the, who is America yesterday? I haven't watched a single episode of, I love it. I love that show by the way. I'll do that. You know, there was a lot of, there was a lot of talk about it and not think it was great what he did. I mean, all he did was he set up people to, to show the ugly people if, if they had it. But I did not see that episode. Please. A genius man, man. I went real quick story. I was like, there's a band called Hell Down Glory that I've loved for years and the lead singer and lead were virgil. They live in Reno. And so he took me to Reno on the, I'd been Rena before, but he took me on the hell bound glory tour of Reno, uh, which was him going to different bars and shit. And he took me to this guy's house and it was, it was a friend of his lived down the street and they was like, their garage was open and a bunch of people hanging out playing vinyls in this dude and drinking, you know. And at some point this guy was like, hey, I got show you something.

Speaker 4:          00:20:48       And he reached into his ceiling light. He had like one of these but not what the, the uh, uh, clouds on it. It was just a regular like light and you pull out and he had up in there, he had an x ray that he pulled out and it was an x ray of a woman's vagina with a flying v Guitar neck that the head stock in, in it. It was an x ray of that. So it got stuck. I mean, I don't know how, I mean with the fucking tuning pegs and everything, but it was, it was a, so, you know, you know, oh, can you believe coming out? Yeah. I mean, how can we, going in

Speaker 1:          00:21:24       woman's vagina is remarkably flexible thing. They make babies, babies come out of their bodies.

Speaker 4:          00:21:32       Yeah. But I mean that's a whole hormonal thing. Their body sets up for nine months to let happen. I mean, just sticking, maybe she really loves music. Oh Man. Maybe she really, really, really loves hair metal and went there.

Speaker 1:          00:21:43       Maybe it's just a giant fan of slayer wants that once that guitar in her body. Woo. But my friend Steve said he, they pulled all kinds of things out of people's bodies and uh, he said he saw he was in Miami and he said that it was during the cocaine days when I met steering the cocaine days. Like they ended, oh yeah, that's over bro. That's like, so 1980. Uh, but he was there during the eighties, seventies and the 80s. That's when I met him. Okay. I was in high school when I met him. Um, so I think I was 15 or 16. Where'd you go to high school? Newton south high in Newton, Massachusetts. A suburb of Boston. How'd you meet him? A taekwondo. And he was, uh, he was, uh, doing his residency for ophthalmology and uh, I was a young high school kid who was competing and so it's all, I was over there every day.

Speaker 1:          00:22:38       So if you came there, he saw me. And um, he, uh, he, so he was doing his residency in Boston. He was a, he was finishing it up in Boston, but he had done some of his work before that in Miami. So this was, I graduated in 85 so he was probably Miami, like 80, 81, somewhere around. Then he just got back. He showed me all kinds of pictures, dude. Wow. This is back before the Internet. I got to see brains, people's brains hanging out. You showed me some photos of bullet holes with a polaroid or something. Take question. I Dunno. I don't remember. Dubious. Dubious there. Well, people were dead. You know, the brains, they were dead. I didn't get to see like the, the light bulb up the asshole. He didn't have to pay. Hey man, stay still while you're screaming. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:23:26       But uh, distract him. But he legitimately did have some photos of some atrocious things, but he said it was just to go from being a medical school school student to doing your residency in Miami and just seeing just crazy amounts of violence. He said it was just insane. Like if you seen cocaine cowboys, I have not. Oh my God. Billy Corbin, who's been on the, maybe made two of the most amazing documentaries ever. That's about the blow air on cocaine. I mean, uh, the movie blow and all that. George [inaudible], George hung or whatever. Well, no, it was, how about Grizelda Griselda Blanco. Who is this a bad ass bitch from Columbia? Was she from Columbia? Bogota? Yes. That was the Miami Shit when I think I saw part of that documentary, but I always wanted to watch it. Oh, it's so good. It's so, he's getting, just got two of them, so if you, you do it, you got to fucking get together.

Speaker 1:          00:24:22       Docent, cocaine cowboys to why? Fuck around with a crazy, hard to remember a cql name, but a cocaine cowboys one and two. Oh my God. It's that. There was one year where everyone who graduated from the police academy either was murdered or went to jail. Every single graduate. Wow. Was either killed because they had a part, a part of the cocaine business or a, they went to jail for being corrupt. Wow. All of them. Wow. There's more pay. I don't know if this is true, please google this. There. There were at least at the time, more banks per capita in Miami than anywhere else in the country because it was all use to launder cocaine money. Wow. Yeah. No Bullshit, man. Again, man, you get that level of money as he started getting banks and stuff. I'm just saying those two documentaries, I can't say enough good things about them.

Speaker 1:          00:25:18       They're so good. It sounds exhausting. Not the documentaries, but the actual business of doing it. Well. That's why you need coke and new coke while you were in that sense, get high on your own supply, man. That's the only way to keep up with the young kids. I mean, if you guys, Rick Ross, which one? The real one or the fake one? The rapper freeway. Ricky. No, no, no, no. Yeah, the real Rick Ross. I know. I know. There's the freeway, ricky. Yeah, that's the one you want to ask. You don't want to ask the wrapper. The wrapper was a prison guard. Do you know that? Yes. Yes. Well, you know freeway, ricky who's been on the show a couple times, sued to get his name back and just to keep his dude from using his name because he was actually Rick Ross. That's his actual fucker. Ne Story.

Speaker 1:          00:26:00       I didn't know he was on your show, Dude. He's been on twice. Rick Ross freeway. Ricky was the guy who was selling all the cocaine that paid for the contras when the contracts are fighting the Sandinistas in Nicaragua and that whole aura north shit course freeway. Ricky was the one who was selling all the coat to these people. He didn't know how he's getting these coke. He didn't know. He was actually getting it deep, deep, deep state telling you, I'm telling you to find the threshold. And he learned, he learned how to read and it's a great style. Ricky learned how to read in jail and then learn how to become a lawyer in jail and then realize they tried him for a, they did. They hit him with three strikes, but they hit him with two charges at the same time, which is not how three strikes work.

Speaker 1:          00:26:47       So you went to jail for life and then got released for time for time served because they tried him incorrectly. Oh right. It's okay. Just one of be strikes was in exactly one of his strike. There were there were at the same time, you can't do that. It has to be like you go to jail, you come out, you go to jail again, you come out and go to jail again and go, all right, you're a criminal and then they keep you in jail. That was a high idea, which is fucked up man. Hey, what's it like sitting across the table from him? He's a very nice guy. Very smart guy. He was a tennis player, man. Played tennis in Compton. Yeah. Couldn't fucking read men, couldn't read, played tennis and Compton and was just seeing all these people around him that were making crazy amounts of money.

Speaker 1:          00:27:26       Wow. And is a real calm, nice guy. And that's one of the reasons why he did so well said. He wasn't this crazy buckwild do drive and rolls royces, throwing money out the window. He wasn't that guy. He was like the cool, calm, collected John Wick sort of character that kept his shit together, you know, and everybody respected him because of that. He just was like, you mean the same reason why he learns how to be a lawyer while he's in prison? He's a systematic, you know, intelligent dude who just had a shit education, you know, just grew up in a very bad, scary, dangerous environment and you know, didn't even learn to read until the guts in jail in Lincoln, the history of the Iran contra conspiracies on lake got cocaine. He was the guy that figured out how to sell this shit and wow.

Speaker 1:          00:28:11       It was selling coke and didn't even know who he was selling it for. Didn't know that the people he was selling it for like the, the, the contacts that he had were directly supplied by the Oliver North, the Bush and yeah. Wow. Interesting man. Wow. I used to have oliver north for president t shirt. I wore it just to piss people off. I didn't even know what it meant. I was like 17 or something. Shit. Oh man, that's not, ah, yeah man. It's a, the whole thing is crazy that this rick Ross guy, the rapper was actually a prison guard. There's a photo of him was fucking prison guard uniform on. Wow. I mean I like him a lot. I ran across the web. Are, do I liked that big songs a lie on what's the big st the better now the big single, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:28:54       I do one big one that I've sang before. What's the record with a Dell is a lie on it. That was a record that I loved. What's his big hit? Me and Manton hanging out a lot and we listened to Rick Ross all the time. That's like really? Yeah, because gets to get together. Do Code. I mean, I mean the nights, right? Uh, no. A bit like a that, yeah, like I liked the rick Ross guy that was going to come in, but he wouldn't do it on camera. It was weird. Like you wouldn't do it after he wanted to do it. They'll do it at a certain time of night. But so here's the thing, man. Some of that shit is publicists cause I'll tell you the same thing happened with Liz phair who I'm a giant fan of hundred percent. I've been a fan of Liz phair for Andrew and exile in Guyville was fucking fantastic. Fucking loverage record and evil empire at the same time at the record store

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       in Nashville, Tennessee. That Reggie's machine and Exxon guy. Totally. My wife also miss who we went near with WHO's listing. She loved Liz phair too at the time she, she came and we got high together. She's like, you can get high here. I'm like, yeah, I don't have a boss. Alex Jones got high as fuck on high. That was fucking awesome. He's trying to come back on and I just don't know if I could do it. Oh come on, let him come on. They're fucking socks up them down. They are shutting them down. But the problem is he still on trial this, this whole trial that's going on with the Sandy Hook and all that shit has to be resolved for us. But it doesn't mean like Bill Maher respect to Bill Maher. I respect him for saying he gets to speak to, he was on his show and people were clapping and cheering that he was pulled off of these networks and pulled off of everything.

Speaker 3:          00:30:26       He's like, look, this guy has said crazy lies about me is what Bill Maher said. He said to the guy said crazy lies about me. He goes, but he still gets to talk like this is what America is about. Free speech means all speech. But see like, here's what I don't understand. Like Alex had me on many times and he supported my record. Black ribbon sort of Cayman. Yeah. You've been on the Alex Jones show many times. I've been, I've been on it three times. Where you ever sober? Yeah. Every time. Yeah. Every time. Doesn't show sober. I've never, I, it was never a situation. Well, the first time I was, uh, we have the black ribbons record that I did as Steven King and stuff like, so when that record came out, nobody would support the record. So Alex and things on your record. Yeah, older record from what I do, he plays, he plays a Dj or a radio talk show hosts that comes in and out of the record.

Speaker 3:          00:31:14       Um, Stephen King. Yeah, as Stephen King. So like when I did that record, Alex Jones is the only person that would support the record. He put it, he, he debuted the whole record on his show and then I went, it was on for two hours by phone and then I went in and was on his show in person, uh, about just the music business. That's all we were talking about and like kind of how things were. And then later I was on for bitcoin discussion kind of, um, by skype or something. But I will say this in his defense in all of this, I just think that like, dude, that guy has been saying things, conspiracy theories about all kinds of things. What do you want? Call him that or not? They'd like forever. And like now the, the situation is like so volatile that like they're going to, you know, the sandy hook thing.

Speaker 3:          00:32:04       All right. So like they definitely caught fucking Anderson Cooper having the green screen and it's probably because they had another person. They're talking to the mom and then they know what happened. There's a video of Anderson Cooper interviewing one of the moms from Sandy Hook and he walked, he leans a little too far forward and his nose disappears and it's probably because they had a standing report or talking to the mom and what Anderson Cooper was then like, uh, put in via, you know, whatever crane and like you kind of need to see that is there, I mean, I know this is where we're propelling, but my point is, is like, and I'm not, I mean sandy hook, I remember where I was when I heard about sandy hook and it was horrific. And I don't believe for a second that there's like, it's all fake or anything like that.

Speaker 3:          00:32:50       But like Alex's thing has always been that I remember watching him go to Bohemian Grove and when we did the fucking record on, this is back when nobody was paying attention to them. It just certain small group. But I remember we did the black ribbons record and we took a clip of the laughing. He went, he snuck into Bohemian Grove and film the ceremony and there like a scene where they were not a scene. I get the scene in his film, but there's a part of that where they're doing the ceremony and they have this light. It's like Disneyland when you go well look to our God. Yeah, yeah. But it's like, it's done in a way where it's like Disneyland when you watch like the ferries fly around the castle. Like there was a whole thing where there was like a laugh that happens at the end of the MOLEC thing or whatever.

Speaker 3:          00:33:36       Or the big Al and the, and the funeral pyres drove. So druids, right. So like I used a part of that, but I remember watching that documentary and he, you know, his deal has always been so over the top where like you go, he's like, where are the, he like, go to the local people aren't near Bohemian Grove. He's like, we're looking for where the Satan, it's go to go do the thing, you know? And it's obviously at this point, it's not like people who are knowingly satanist. It's like really old fat rich guys that go there and there's probably hookers and all kinds of shit because that's what happens at big rich things, especially in the nineties I mean, so he get away with it. You're right. And so like now with all this, and they're crucifying him, especially pointing especially the Megan Kelly thing, and I just feel bad for it.

Speaker 3:          00:34:18       I mean, especially the Manga because that was clearly a hidden piece with Alex because like they, she buddied up to him and then then focus that piece on the sandy hook thing. You know, they had their talk in her defense, how could she not? Of course she's got us if you're going to come, if I was going to come, but if I came here with the, with the intention of like just talking to you and then all of a sudden you were like, hey, on this day on this thing, when you did this thing, like you focused on this one thing, now it'd be like, Oh man, like this is a hit piece. Like, yeah, but you're a musician and he's, this is what he does. I know my friend, he's been my friend since 1999. I get more shit from being friends with Alex Jones and anything in my life because actually, you know what I'm just saying like, I'm sure I'll get hit for this, but the point is, is that point check checker twitter, I'm ready for it. I don't, you know what, I don't have time to check it maybe next year, but like, um, but the reality is I just think that, and I'm not even here from like the side of the political point of view is this is this, watch this video was the video. It says d quality Anderson Cooper's disappearing, knows Greenstein clip debunked. See that? Hold on. Do you see what it says was debunked? Which means happens. Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:35:40       hold on, let, I'm sorry, wasn't bad. Quality video right here. It'll play about three seconds. Then there's a, it, there's a weird part on his nose that happens. But to say it's a green screen, I would just, I would tell the same, the same people that are looking for conspiracies and everything. They use this to say that the space station didn't exist. Right, but hold on. Stick right around right there. Hold on some and you can't even really see it. It's something really happened to those super quick. It looks like it was. It was just like a digital glitch. That's it. No, that's not it. And this is what they said. I couldn't find it anywhere else. The other piece he leans forward is no, look, here's what I think. I think that they had a stand in because he couldn't be there, but hold on. You might be wrong, right? I could be. This is, we're talking about several years ago you might have been fucked up memory this. Let's try to find the video that said he was there all week shooting from the exact same location. Maybe it was, maybe I'm wrong. Got You. They got to you. Shooter Jennings. I would say the same thing. You know, you make more than a hundred thousand dollars a year. Dude knocks on your door and starts talking to you about conspiracy.

Speaker 1:          00:36:44       Well, if you make it $34,000 a year, you look at people to make 100,000 like damn, you had to pick all my fucking bills and he gets to that hundred thousand dollar level. Well you got to sell out son. But that's how people look at it. But there is a threshold. There is a threshold. I remember when I was broke, I had an a suburban. I wasn't broke but it was, I was doing it right but I had a suburban and some guy and I got into a fucking road rage situation on the highway and he goes, you fucking rich asshole. I go rich [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:37:11       driving a fucking suburban man. Like what is rich to you? Rich is driving a suburban fine ma'am. I have that like I already had the rich thing because people thought that I was rich because my dad, which I never really, I never was. I mean he was supportive of me, but once I got here it was, I was Kinda on my own and I liked that. But then then once I talk about bitcoin with you, like fucking five years ago or whenever it was, I was here three years ago and everyone's like, oh, you gotta be rich now. Cause that was like I can not rich coin. Yeah. But I mean look, what's the point up til like seven grand now. Yeah. It went up to 19 zero seconds. Keep going down. It hadn't dropped very much below six grand. But I mean when I was here with you it was like less than a grant.

Speaker 3:          00:37:56       But um, you know what I'm trying to say about this is not like I'm not validating his, this Anderson Cooper thing, but that dude has always been fishing for things like that and it's always been his gig and it's been as Gig from columbine. It's been as Gig from all of this. And I understand that the passion and the emotion involved with the children that died in sandy hook. And I have no, I'm not defending him on that deal. But at the same time, that's always been this guy's Gig. I feel like dad is where he legitimately fucked up. I don't think if you take, you take away, I got to defend him. I just can't say to fucking fuck up. Yeah, but this

Speaker 5:          00:38:35       is a silly fuckup he's saying that for sure it was a fake, but did he say for sure it's a Aa did people sent me the clip? They sent me the clip of him saying that it was 100% fake. He thought it was fake. So he said it, but he thought it was fake. Yeah, he thought it was a, he thought it was a false flag. So he said it. I mean, but that's part of them. That's a part of the conspiratorial thinking. That's a real problem. It's like saying, you know, he said some shit about me. He said said some shit about me and it's 100% not true. He said that the post your interview with them, I don't remember. I think it was post, it was post. He said that the government threatened my family to stop talking about conspiracy theories. No, no. Nobody threatened my family. No one zero never happened. Did Not happen. It is fake. It is a lie. Someone told it to him, I guess, or he says someone told to him.

Speaker 6:          00:39:28       Okay,

Speaker 5:          00:39:29       it didn't happen. There's so, that's me. I understand, but he's, you understand like how frustrating that is. This is a minor thing. Someone him lying, not lying. Okay, somebody, he said, someone told him, I believe he's telling the truth,

Speaker 5:          00:39:46       but it's not true. He could have fucking called me. He's got my number man. Call me. So he didn't even bother calling me [inaudible] about to go live from Austin, Texas. I need to know did someone threaten your family? Stop talking about the moon landing and big foot sturgeon. Same Magic to fucking imagine that going to threaten you to, you got to stop talking about big foot man. I'm like, well no, I, I found, I did a show. This is a well documented, I've talked about it a hundred times in the podcast. I did a show called Joe Rogan questions, everything and during that show, over a period of six months, I fucking question a lot of shit legitimately, but I did it with researchers. We had the staff, we had producers, we went and we actually went to like these places where these people are claiming to see you fo's who went to these places where people are claiming to be able to uh, what does that shit they do?

Speaker 5:          00:40:40       Remote viewing. Remote view. Yeah. We talked to those guys. Great movie. We talked to all these people and I found a real, a clear thread through all of it that I documented in my 2014 comedy central special where I said, here's what you don't find. When you go looking for bigfoot black people, what you do find is unfuckable white dudes, you will more likely define big foot. Then you are black people out looking for big wholesale alien abductions probably can. It's dudes you can't get laid and they go looking for hidden mysteries. It need that. This is a real big part of it. I know. My point is from doing that, show it, it's soured me off conspiracy theories. Conspiracy theories were fun for me and me and my, especially Eddie Bravo mean Eddie Bravo would get high and we'd watched documentaries on flying rods and all this ufo documentaries and all the other, the the, the fucking

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       Zachariah sitch and she love it. I love that. I love that stuff. But here's the thing, I used to watch a, a chariots of the gods all the time to get it all falls apart under scrutiny. It all of it, all, all of it. It's fun, but it falls apart if you're being a serious person. And if you really being honest about what you actually know, this is the problem. It's like the saint and the parallels, like that comparison comparing to Alex Jones, saying that my family was threatened. It's the same thing. My family was never threatened. No one ever threatened me. So, but he's saying this on the radio. Why is he saying it? Because someone told him and he may be, he believes it and he also thinks it's fun to say. It's the thing to say if you're really into conspiracies, but this is the problem with these fucking conspiracies.

Speaker 3:          00:42:14       They say things they don't know are true and they say, I'm like, they're true now. This is fine. If you just hold on, it's fine if it's not an issue. If you're talking about the Illuminati, if you talking about your kid getting shot, if your kid's dead and someone says, hey man, this fucking Tom Smith on the radio saying you're full of Shit. You're a crisis actor and your kid's not dead me and you're crying every night. You wake up in the middle of night crying because some fucking guy, but you are a little bit, I'm just visiting this right to be Alex Jones. I and I defend that as well for being David. I'll coat one time I would have David Allen Coe do. I played a show with David [inaudible]. This is not any, let's get sandy hook out of this because I'm not trying to talk about this. Let's make some defending the right of people to be who they are.

Speaker 3:          00:43:02       And I love David Alinka is music and all that, but I played a show with David Onco one time and my dad always would tell me these things about him. You know, he, he really, he liked David and everything, but there was always kind of a little distance of like, there was a showman ship part of him and they're like a good example of this, again, distancing from sandy hook. But a good part of it was that when, when David Allan Coe, we did a show with him one time my mom was over on the side of the stage of me. I was opening for him. This is many years ago before I even had a first record out or anything. Um, and David Onco did a sh, you know, we did our song, our set and then he played and he was onstage and he performed a song my mom wrote called storms never last.

Speaker 3:          00:43:49       So my mom's over on the side of the stage and we were talking. He and my mom are watching it and he's singing it with his wife and stuff. The next night I'm opening up for him and he goes on stage and he goes, last night, Jesse culture was right in the front row when I sang this song with my wife and she was crying and like I'm sitting there going, I was here and she was not crying. She was standing as you called it. She was not on the front row. Right, right. My mom just killed her, wrote this song, storms never last teasing and, and that's his character. That's who he is. All I'm saying here with like, I'm as forgiving about him lying to the audience because that is what he's doing at the moment. It's his. I could sit there and go, you know what, you're, I'm going to take you in the back.

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       We're going to talk, I'm going to tell this audience tomorrow night. He's a liar. He's a piece of shit. Fuck him. I'm not going to do that because it's David Allen Coe. He's done. You just sit it on the show, which is, I'm not much larger audience heading the millions and millions of pieces of shit. I'm just saying I do character, but why would I do that to him? Because it's like, you know, I just feel like, look man, the Times that I met Alex, the Times I've been around him, yeah man, his Gig is this and he got called out for a specific thing. Yes, it involves the lives of children and everything that I understand that I'm not, I'm not at all sympathizing for those family or for him versus those families. But I'm just saying, I just think that like at the moment everything is so hot with this and it's, and it's kind of exhausting and it's the Internet is the reason for it.

Speaker 3:          00:45:20       And in my opinion, because I think that like all of the years that have come along, the mass amount of people that have migrated to social media, the way that the integrated conversations happened, the way that that stuff ends up on the news now, like aol chat rooms in fucking 1998 that shit did not end up on CNN. People were not listening to those, that the best thing to get, the closest you could get to fucking tv was to catch a Predator when you were on that at that time. You know? And I feel like at this point in time, people need, again, not those families there lawsuit. That's fine. That's their thing. But, but I just feel like people need to lighten up a little bit. In the sense of, uh, I just think that the social media thing is very hazardous and I think that people's faith in all of it, it doesn't have to do with, with fake news and it doesn't have to do with Russian bots and all this shit.

Speaker 3:          00:46:13       I just think that like Alex Jones is a casualty because he's always been, what do you mean by it doesn't have to do with fake news and Russian by, I mean that like teachers always excuses for all the reasons why people understand you. That's real, right? I believe that of course fake news is real, but there's like, there's, there's an NPR document. No, no, no. I'm a radio lab podcast about Russian troll farms. It's fucking fascinating. It's really interesting. I mean, these people show up at work and their, their basic job is to put propaganda out on instagram and social media and twitter and comments. And I agree on that stuff. I agree. But, but let's, let's get out of it. Let me, let me tell you an example. Uh, what I, what I have seen of this, I run a bulletin board system called bits sunrise, which is like old technology that used to be modems used to dial into Baltimore.

Speaker 3:          00:47:07       It systems. You can tell net into it. Tell net is a port port 23 is the telnet port. Well dvrs also share port 23. So dvrs like to have yards like your, your TV connected to storing your not all, not all. Yeah. Will you, if you record a show on a weekly basis, it is. There is an open port. It's not always 23 on the units, but it's shared with, with the telnet port. So during the election, during the months up to the election and the months after the election, I would say four months, five months leading up five months after on my bolt. This kind of technical when it, when I'm trying to explain this to, but uh, uh, when you, when you tell net into a computer you use for mine, you would tell them that end and it would give you a log in you, it has a picture this drawn and you, you put your name and your address or your password and you log in.

Speaker 3:          00:48:05       Well, during the five months leading up to the election and the five months afterwards, I was getting every day, probably all day long, 10 or 20 connections that were coming in and they were just, uh, uh, wouldn't say a Bot. They were like, they were scripts that were trying to log into dvrs and trying to log in to, um, like Ip cameras that you can control and everything like that. So I was watching for, for that about a year period. So let me pause you here. So you're saying that these bots, we're trying to control dvrs and cameras that people have on their television. They were just testing and 90% of them were coming for China. 10% of them are coming from maybe Russia and other places, but 90% China, Korea, because you can look at the Ip addresses. So what are they testing for the test? All their flaws and they're trying to do is they would try, they would be looking for a Lennox login, which would be like um, you know, login again, like if you were to tell net or ssh into a device like that, the first thing that would get was a login and usually it's root is the controller.

Speaker 3:          00:49:11       And so they were just trying to find, they were just just blindly mass blindly going to Ip addresses in trying to hack into them route and then they try password. Then they try like this. They tried that, they tried the black, you know, so the Russian Bot thing, I understand that, but I don't think it was a coordinated effort. I think that like all during that whole time I was watching my computer, like I have, it's kind of, I'm getting real nerdy here, but it's like I have these games that like in that people play and like once you get past the 13th, 14th, 15th node, which essentially means like once there's 15 people playing at the same time, then the game stop working. So I would be having to deal with these Chinese and Russia thing, Russian and all these, all of them just mass trying to just break in.

Speaker 3:          00:49:57       And it was because of the dvrs and because the Ip cameras, like they were really literally trying to hack your system to just do whatever. I don't know what the purpose was, but like I watched it and it was, it was China mostly. I mean Russia was a small amount and I think that all those countries all the time or have people that are constantly trying to uh, hack and interact with these, uh, with our shit. I mean, it's just a thing, you know, there's that as well. There's that as well. Yeah. But I think all of there's that as well.

Speaker 5:          00:50:28       But there's also people that are absolutely trying to influence elections. They're absolutely trying to influence our system and that they're trying to manipulate political parties and they're trying to start descent. And this is one of the things that's really fascinating about this, a radiolab podcast where they talk about how these Russian troll farms literally set up protests. They hired people to pretend to be Donald Trump, and they hired people to pretend to be hillary and put her in a cage and have people chanting, lock her up. Like this is all manufactured descent and manufactured outrage that there they're strategically promoting. I mean, that's fascinating to me. But here you've got to think, pause for a second. You got to think Russia is we, you're talking about a giant place. Okay. So to pretend that what's happening with these people hacking into dvrs and web cameras is all that's happening.

Speaker 5:          00:51:20       So, but you're saying what you're exposed to that you witnessed as small example of what happens when people are exploiting vulnerabilities in systems. But that doesn't mean that's the only thing that's going on. No, I'm not saying that at all. I know you're not, but I want to clarify. There's a lot of things that are going on. There's a lot of things that are going on because people are dealing with these new technologies and these cases terms and which way? Well, with the Russian hacking elections thing like, and I don't like to get political because I don't really fuck, you don't have to get political. Look at it objectively looking at it like a system. Like look at it like this, look at it like you have a body. Okay. And your body has an immune system and your body's immune system is constantly under threat of all sorts of different things.

Speaker 5:          00:52:02       You, you fucking touch a door knob, you wipe your nose. There's a lot of shit going on. Right? This is very similar if you just looked at it objectively to what happens whenever you have a server on the Internet, when you, we need, you hear about the Republican Party getting hacked into or you know, different people's emails getting exploited by, you know, someone from outside. That's a hacker. What is that? Well that's they're trying to find a way through the system. It's just natural thing. If you put up a wall, people go, hmm, how do I get past that wall? You know, if you make $34,000 a year and a guy makes $1 million, what does that guy know? There's, this is a natural thing that happens. How is this any different? Like I guess what I'm trying to ask about this, it's like when I was watching that happen with my system, it's like how is this any different than what is going on for the last hundred years?

Speaker 5:          00:52:52       Cause he comes. Okay. Because it's new because no one has been able to get it. I don't know. It's new. No one has been able to get into your folders before. No one's been able to get, no, no. One kid sitting in Czechoslovakia who has a computer has been able to figure out how to turn your Webcam on and watch it beat off. This is a new thing, but we didn't have a Webcam to beat off. It doesn't matter for, but you understand what I'm saying? Yeah. This is a new thing. This is a new thing. So because this is a new thing, I feel like for some reason, but it is human nature thing. It is human nature. But I don't understand what your point is. Well, I guess what I'm asking here is, is,

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       is in, in the way of the, I just feel like the Russian Bot thing is, was all of that, I feel like the Russian bots is, is a, is a term for people who don't understand computers in a way, and they've, they've just kind of thrown that out there as a political device sometimes. I think that Russia, China, Korea, like every other fucking country that is enabled in a way in which they're so far ahead technologically was involved in all kinds of fucking fuckery. And there's still involved in it. It will still do that. During the election it was fucking a hundred times. Sure. But, uh, you know, I'm just, I just, it's hard for me, you know, back circling around to the Alex Jones thing, all of this new technology, all of the people who are awake woke facebook on facebook. They know you're an angel, you're woke on facebook.

Speaker 3:          00:54:20       So wake, you know, it's like a, I felt bad for fucking childish Gambino that he had a song that had stay woke and it, because immediately that song that that was what an amazing song and it was a, it was that that term became dumb immediately. But I, but I just feel like, um, all of this that's happening, all of this talk, all of the him getting banned, all of this stuff, it's all this kind of like effect of the world instead of being out in the world. Everyone has, has, has gone to this point where it's, you know, these groups, these really rich groups, Google and facebook and twitter and all this and everyone has, has gone to this central point and other lynching people, whether or not you agree with Alex Jones, whether or not you like him, whether or not I think he's being launched in the situation right there.

Speaker 3:          00:55:11       So I get, I get that there's all these people that are doing all these different nefarious things. This has been going on forever and now they're using new systems to do that. They using the internet and all these open pipes and these connections that they can make trick is that the public is there. They've gotten them to go to this a one arena. That is my problem with it. Is it like as much of a nerd and a technology person? I am. I like, I hate that people have instead of really, I mean I'm sure they have their own lives but like the fact that we have become so centralized to these small groups of Internet companies like social media and things and then now look, it's on both sides man. I mean Alex Jones is getting lynched. Harvey Weinstein, whatever. I know he's, he's a very different things, but every, everyone is a very, very, very, very, very different than not defending him. But I understand how you made this behavior, but the connection is the fast connection as people were just attack the findings. The minute it look, those people could have suits against Harvey Weinstein, Stein Steen, and we can know about it. Of course we knew about it because the Wall Street Journal or what, whoever, or New York Times who were in that thing was a new yorker. Yeah. The new, yeah. But

Speaker 5:          00:56:24       I guess my point is, is, you know, I mean, I, I'm sure this is an unpopular opinion, but I just feel like that the centralization of society into social media is resulting in a lot of things that are very ugly. And I think that the Russian Bot thing, the Chinese hackers thing, the Alex Jones issue, the me too movement, all that stuff, which I, I'm, I'm behind all the people that, that were hurt. I'm not, I'm behind the sandy hooks people on behind the people who had the bad experiences in Hollywood. All that. What are you proposing? What are you saying? I'm just saying that I think that, that it's unhealthy. I think that social media thing has become too centralized. There needs to be decentralized, uh, sort of centralized because there's all your kids in groups. They are instagram. I mean, it's 100% centralized. I mean, it's owned by a group, several groups.

Speaker 5:          00:57:20       It's several, uh, you know, everyone's kind of going to Mcdonald's to have these conversations as opposed to it being something that is a little more healthy. I just find, I just think that that people, I think Alex Jones should have always been able to be crazy in his world. And he was always nice to me. And you, you said he's your friend. Like, you know what the problem with Alex's, he needs someone sitting right next to them. Someone like me, someone who when he talks and he said something crazy, go wait a minute. Wait, how do you know that? And he goes, well we have the documents will show me the documents. Well the documents don't say that. Well you know, the problem is, or they are definitely trying to influence. And he'd go, yeah, they probably are. But if you leave them alone, if you leave them alone and just let them rant.

Speaker 5:          00:58:02       By the way, he's doing six hours, eight hours of radio a fucking day. And he's definitely likes to drink. So he's doing six hours of radio a day. At least three of them are drunk and he's fucking fill in time and screaming and no one can say anything to him. And he's the fucking man over there. That's also part of the problem. He's got a bunch of these other people that are around them all the time and there conspiracy theories as well. But there are 28 and you know, and then you know, they're hanging out with Alex Jones and it goes on rants and no one interrupts them. It's abroad argument with all of it because I agree. But he was always, he was always transmitting. He was always like, Hey, show me where the Satanists are going to worship it took to sacrifice children. That's fine.

Speaker 5:          00:58:42       But I get it. I think what happened is now the idea is that he's influencing people politically. Like the whole, you know the whole uh, Podesta pizza gate, that all that stuff was scared the shit out of people when that guy showed up at that pizza place and fire off around and you know, and then they want up arrest them and they really thought there was a dungeon in the basement where again, kids centralizing in social media is the cause for a lot of these reactions. Is that centralizing and social media or is that people exciting people to go and take action against something that may or may not even be real? If you are you allowed to yell out fire in a crowded theater, right. This is what ultimately the problem, right? It's not whether or not he believes in Bohemian Grove, which is real and be proved it on video back when they had vhs tapes and I watched it.

Speaker 5:          00:59:28       I mean I've known Alex since 99 or 98 I think maybe I've known for a long ass time and that this is a very big difference between then and what's happening now is as far as the reach and influence and I think people are sort of panicking about reach and influence and what it means and how to mitigate it, how to change people, how to stop people from going into pizza places and shooting them up because they think that something that they heard online is true. There's a lot of stuff that people hear online that isn't just not true. You know, the lizards underground or the fucking earth land flat and there's a lot of stuff that's just nonsense. So it's, it's hard to separate. Here's what I think. I think we are going through an adolescent stage as a, as a being, as an evolving being.

Speaker 5:          01:00:15       And I think our bodies and our minds and our consciousness are becoming synchronized with technology. And along the way, like right now we are in this chaotic screaming, sweating, crying, pissing shitting, state of chaos. And we are looking to figure out how to stop the bleeding. We're looking to shove thumbs into dykes, dykes meaning like dams and we're looking to try to figure out a way to stop the bleeding. We're trying to put patches and bandaids on things. We're trying to manage the chaos. We're trying to figure out what, and this is a stage that we're going through because this, hold on a second. This is a new thing. This is a new thing for human beings. The ability to communicate widespread over millions and millions of people instantaneously is a new thing. So people have say that never had say before, they have influenced it, never had an influence before.

Speaker 5:          01:01:12       They have their ability to contribute and they might not have thought these things through and these things catch fire and they run through dry forest like a goddamn tornado of, of, of, of flames that you see on CNN when the Mendocino fire up in northern California, this is, this is what happens with ideas because there's no way to contain them and they don't know what's right or what's wrong. I think that what we're going through from the period of 1994 the period of 2018 is like a crazy fire in the middle of a hurricane. It's like everything is nuts and no one knows how to stop it and no one knows what to do and what do we do? We get together and shelters and we fucking give people water and we tried to stop the fire and take away everyone's lighters and that's what we're doing right now. We're trying to take away lighters. We trying to stop people who start fires and this is what's happening with Alex and it's not that Alex is a bad guy, is that he has, he's by himself eras. It's irresponsible to say that you know, for sure a fact that these parents from sandy hook or crisis actors and their kids never died. It's irresponsible. And he didn't think it was irresponsible when he was doing

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       it because he's probably caught up in what he does and he's caught up in the wave of ad libbing just like you and I are ad living. We didn't even talk about what the fuck we're going to talk about. Right. Turned on and where we had a couple of drinks. You're, what you're saying there is very red. I don't mean to cut you off. It's okay, but, but what you're saying there is very smart because to me, uh, you know, it is, it's, you're right. He, he has always been doing this and it just point in time his reach has grown, right. And he's now there's a wind behind him. He used to be it. Oh, in Seattle. It was raining every day and he had a little patch of dry newspaper, like that shit on fire and everybody go, ah, Alex is crazy. Yeah, no, I agree.

Speaker 3:          01:03:02       I think, I think, I think what I'm trying to articulate, and I'm not doing as well as I wanted to, but I think what my problem is, is the synchronization of consciousness is what I'm not into. I think that I think, you know, just like you have a Rut of people who believe that, uh, you know, they now believe that the sandy hook thing is fake and they're calling the families because of this conversation. This is where that lawsuit is really coming from because the other people, but then you also have another side of it. And it could be, as you know, back in the day when they said that Paul Mccartney was dead, but they got harassed, but it was on such a small level because there was no way to just email Paul Mccartney and, or email and say, you're not the real public mccartney. You're fucking dead.

Speaker 3:          01:03:53       Not just that. There was no way to exchange these ideas amongst people real time on facebook all day long, which is the centralization that creates these rivers and in these ruts that people who don't know what to do and they fall into one rut or another and they kind of become this, this, this kind of streamline thing. So I think the way you just described it as is very, um, articulate essentially thing. Matt is a new thing when we are in a really exciting time. But why, why I say that? Because they used to say that about the printing press. They used to worry about that with the written word. They used to worry about that with everything. The distribution of information is not, it's not whether or not it's healthy, it's just a part of what the, this being does with this being does is constantly search for innovation and novelty.

Speaker 3:          01:04:39       That's what, that's what the human being does. But like I guess, I guess yes, but it was looking at your phone over there, man, you got to fucking iphone. Don't you think you could go to the people making an iphones and go, hey bro, we're good. Yeah. Yes. Is it, and this is stop. You can stop. It's not, we're not good. These mother fuckers are ready to come out with the iphone 11 then like the guy you're not going to stop been at the web was invented hyperlinks. And the idea was that if someone went to hog dude, this is just, oh I'm in, I'm in. So like the guy invented the web stolen the time and I should know his name. Gore mother fucker hover, right. It was funny. Think you lie. So this cat, this cat a, all he wanted to do was make it basically we're like medical documents where you would, where you would say like, you know this guy had a brain transplant and then brain transplant will be underlined and you clicked on that and it would take you to a link that explained brain transplants and that would be worldwide.

Speaker 3:          01:05:36       So the Internet is decentralized and the web is decentralized to some degree. Okay. Now Google coming in with search engines, like that's focusing points. What scares me is those people being like facebook being the avenue in whichever it be talks like I, I should scare you is a weed I just handed you holy Shit. I took two hits and I'm not even here anymore. I'm an anti yet I am very high. That's a blunt. That's legit. It took two hits. I liked a little bit louder. I'll fuck around here in California Sun. But you know what I mean? Like I just have a problem with the centralization of the companies owning the avenues in which get taught. I right, I'm right. I'm right with you on that. I think we need more youtube. I think we need more venues for people to distribute, distribute information.

Speaker 3:          01:06:24       But I also think we need more love, more compassion. There's so much hate and anger towards each other. I feel like I'm going to get dark nailed here on this because I'm not, I am not. It's part of the nervousness about doing a live show right after Bush while you were talking. I would say, um, well, I mean I'm not, I'm very nervous right now. I have a fucking drink. But, but I would say five. It's, I'm very nervous. I would say that. Um, oh, this is one of those ones were there. That's, yeah, it's tobacco, tobacco and some shit that was grown on Mars. You know, Armstrong groups we man, see I again, again, it was just like there was a point when you're trying to make sense right now. This is part of the problem, right? I know. This is why I wanted us to get here and we're getting, we're getting super serious about topics that are very, that mean a lot to people and we don't really know enough about it.

Speaker 3:          01:07:15       I just, I just feel like, I just wish that there weren't, like, again, I just, I feel like there's reps that have people have to fall in to communicate and there and there are ruts that are owned by these companies that, that are very fucking rich and varied. Here's the thing too. These companies didn't see this. Like I'm libertarian, I'm not either way. And just in the sense I'm not really that, I don't even fucking know what that is. All I know is I don't believe in trusting anybody who, who says, Hey, I'll take care of you. Come this way. Just don't worry about a thing. And they're the ones making all the money. And it's like, that's how the Internet has become. It used to be a wild west of information. Emails are fucking information that is, that's me communicating with you and no one else seeing it. That's beautiful. And I think the idea of twitter and facebook and all that, it's fantastic when it first started, but at the this point in time, it's gotten so big, if it doesn't break up into something where people figure out that they are in control of the Internet, not these other people. That's what it bothers me. Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:08:15       So what bothers you? Is it someone comes along and says the people aren't in control of the Internet, so it's not like a free market. The free, hold on, sorry. It was a free market. It's a free market. A guy like Alex Jones, you'd say this guy is preposterous. I'm not listening to him anymore. When it's not a free market is when youtube collapse. Well, I dunno if they collaborate. If they just all agree. I don't know if they all agree, but they just all decide everyone's going to take them off. Facebook's gonna suspend him for 30 days. Twitter's going to suspend it for a period of time. Youtube is going to remove them. All these people are going to take vimeo jumped on ship and they pulled them off too. So this, this becomes an issue like what is it that causes you to get removed?

Speaker 5:          01:08:53       What is it and should we be really clear on that or is this just a whim because this is a really important thing. If we really are fucking with free speech we have to be very careful on what we decide. Is is a valid reason to pull people off of our airways? Because if you have stuff on your airways that's far more vile and you let that stay up because it doesn't have the same reach, like what is your criteria? It doesn't have the same influence. It doesn't have the same political ties to it. Like, what is the reason why you're pulling one thing off and not another thing? Is it because of the popularity issue? Have you searched your trillions of fucking hours of footage for offensive speech, content, ideas, disinformation, what have you, what have you really done to mitigate this issue or are you acting on this because it's a social hotspot issue right now, which it most certainly is and most certainly should be.

Speaker 5:          01:09:53       I really think that Alex needs a guy right next to him. He really like, I understand this and I did a show together and Howard Stern, man, no, not the same comparison. I guess Howard's but listen man, let's do him every day. But sometimes I want to be like, dude, are you kidding me? But that's also part of his charm, part of his charm and she creates descent in arguments and you want to get mad and you want to either he's opinionated well, but how it's turns very responsible. He's a different guy. It's not, it's not the same thing. I'm not trying to compare Alex to him. I'm just saying that sometimes I feel the same way about it. About him and it had to feel that way about us right now. This is quit cutting fucking Giorgio moroder tribute records and do a country record. You know, and I do a country record right now and they're like, oh, it's kind of corny.

Speaker 5:          01:10:36       No. Uh, now I got a record coming by the way. I'm sure you do, Dude. I told you I wake up the Triscuit deca phobia every morning. In fact, that's the Stephen King. I will, uh, I'm going to fucking set it so people know I'm not bullshitting. I'm going to set my alarm. What time's it right now? It's two oh five. I'm going to set my alarm for two oh five two oh five perfect. Five triscuit, decorative phobia. You know, I also just, just along with what you're saying is it's like, you know, Oh, it is two oh five guy. It has to be free. Hold the whole sentence. No, it's two. Oh. Oh Oh you're a cathode ray light or clock is things bullshit. Oh, it just turned two oh six.

Speaker 7:          01:11:22       Come on pitch. Why don't you go on?

Speaker 5:          01:11:26       Hmm. Try it. Thinks I'm retarded. Let's go with 2:08 PM that's fact. That's why we give ourselves a little buffer. No, I just feel like, you know, and I fucking, this topic could be, we know we're not, we're not qualified to have this conversation, but no one is. Yeah. So it's just, as long as we're honest about how we feel about things. Look, I didn't go, oh you guys are off. You guys are off. They were a little off. I believe. I believe in protecting children's innocence in a certain way that I, I agree with youtube not allowing porn and stuff like that, you know, because like my kids look at youtube all the time, but what about twitter, twitter or loss? A certain amount of porn. Sometimes we flipping through my time, my phone down, I gotta go Yo Kendra la slow at town. Yeah. Nice call out.

Speaker 5:          01:12:13       Yeah, I mean, you know, it may as well have like, I believe if Isis, if Alex Jones and if the unboxing of the Lolz can exist, what does that mean? Like oils, my daughter, these toys, lls, shopkins and things like that where they show videos of them are the slime videos of doing this, like youtube and those kinds of things. I just think that there is a certain level of like, just ignore it. If you don't like it. Well it's not your thing. The lawsuit thing. Totally. That's out of this context a little bit. He went too far with that big difference between something that you might find gross and something that changes culture. I think what they're worried about is, do you remember when Jim Acosta did that? Uh, he went to that trump rally and they went crazy on him. Do you remember that shit?

Speaker 5:          01:13:00       I don't know. Is it a recent thing? Weeks ago? This is CNN anchor who is reasonably self righteous, but he's in a difficult situation. He's, he has to challenge the president of the United States who is also a famous celebrity billionaire guy. What's his name on buildings? I mean this literally is Rosebud. This is, this is the tale of citizen Kane. I mean, this is someone with an ungodly power and influence and this gym, and I'm not standing up for Jim Acosta. I'm just going to say, just put yourself in that guy's position. What a crazy spot. You're yelling out. Questions at the president of United States who also happens to be Donald Trump. You think like you're on acid the world. The world has gone into a vortex of crazy and you're the guy by some fucking freak of chance, whether you're Jim Acosta or don lemon or, or fill in the blank. Everyone up, it went off. You heard it, he hit the button. I accidentally hit the button to do this correctly, but it mean if you're one of those fucking people, I'm going to hold this picture. It was the weed. Oh Shit. I've got to that off

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       for a few seconds ago. If you're one of those fucking people and that's your job, and we expect them to handle that. That's probably like being beyonce and the rock on steroids, you know? But, but in a negative way, it wouldn't be those two because those are like very beloved celebrities. Like very few people are as beloved as the rock or beyonce. They're pretty much universally beloved, the person uniquely so they're so loved and so deserving of that love. Uh, but if you're a guy like who's a like a real like Takashi six, nine, that kid like you imagine the hate that guy gets all day. Now imagine what's that? He said six. He's a rapper listening every morning I wake up, see my friend. I hope this doesn't get off pulled off of youtube. Alex, can we do that whole thing?

Speaker 8:          01:15:10       Shooter Jennings Bitch recognize. Oh you brought an album delivered. We can sign off. Oh beautiful. I love it. Thanks Adam. You got some bad ass. It's

Speaker 3:          01:15:26       fucking music. Thanks. You really do. I love your music and you know, one of the things I love about your music is like, um, it's all different man. You got some straight up country, put the o back in country. You got to that, you've got that, that whole album man. This is like a bad ass country album, you know. But like with this twist, like a respectful country album that also has a lot of like modern wickedness to it. You know, I appreciate that was the point. Like when we were, when we were doing the first record, it was me and Ted Wrestle camp. He still plays with me and Leroy pal who doesn't play with me anymore, but he played on that record. He played guitar. Brian Kaylin was a drummer. We started doing our shit. Like our idea was we were living here, you know, I just, I had 2003 we started recording the first record and I had met her three years ago and we were like, our whole thing was like, we like rock music because it sounds cool.

Speaker 3:          01:16:20       And we like Dylan and we like, you know, even, I wasn't even smart enough to like Dylan then we were like into fucking, you know, Bowie and I was, I can't came for the nine inch nails side get it. That's how I got into music. We kind of talked about that near the show. But, uh, like by that time the idea was like, can we make country music? We like the old stuff but have it sound cool and why can't we bring in like the stuff that raw that's cool about rock and why can't you go psychedelic and why can't you kind of push the limits that way. And we were just dumb and trying to do it that way. And Dave Cobb, who produced this record, we met, we met that back then and he produced the first record and he was the same way.

Speaker 3:          01:17:02       We were like more Beatles stones, Bowie kids musically in the, in the amount of records we listened to, you know, obsessed over pink floyd and stuff, you know, then we were a country. So we were kind of trying to blend those two back then. I, you know, but we were just, just trying and starting and doing weird shit. And then after a while just evolving. Um, yeah, but the album would be totally different. Like you don't give a fuck dude. It's about the guy who invested in apple in the eighties you just, you just do your music, man, you do your music and whatever you're into right now is like what you do. It's really interesting, like, oh, I appreciate that. And that, I mean, I've listened to, I've listened to every one of your cds and there's only a few of them that are even similar, you know, similar to each other.

Speaker 3:          01:17:53       They're all, they're all, all your albums, I guess you can say albums again. These two cause became cd for awhile. But who the fuck gets a CD old man. And then it's like, I can't say online playlist. You newest online playlist. They're like, what do I say about your newest stems? Our playlist man. Audio release. Yeah man. Uh, no. You know what's black ribbons happen man? I did the first record and that was kind of my take on country and our take as a band and Dave cobb and then, but before that record came out, we started recording the second record and I was like, the first song I wrote was a song electric Rodeo. And we, and I was like, I wanted to go heavy. I wanted to like, just really show up and like do this kind of hard rocky sounding. And what I mean by that is like, you know, fucking we're into Zeplin and shit, like nineties music.

Speaker 3:          01:18:44       It was like, uh, you know, seventies ship. But it was like hard rock, crazy effects. Immigrants saw kind of going crazy. But with the song, the country songs there. And I always felt if electric rodeo got considered a country record when it came out and charted than I felt we, like we had done our thing. But it did come out and it did chart. But once we came out with that, we had universal who had been behind us and they had basically been the, the people that worked at universal had been kind of in my opinion and their opinion duped because Tony Brown and Tim to Blah, who believed in me and we had done this record without a deal and I sent it to Tony Brown cause I knew I just as a kid had met him and him and my dad had done business and I liked him and there was, he had made me feel like he liked me.

Speaker 3:          01:19:35       So I sent him this record after me and the band. And Dave did the record and uh, they believed in me and they signed it and he kind of like remixed our first song so they would play it on radio. And Tony was a big producer, still is. I mean he produced the first bunch Steve Earle records and he played piano for Elvis. Like he and he was our label heads, so he kinda remixed it. So we get on radio. So I'm thinking they like me cause we have like kind of a 20 number 24 yet. So I'm like, I'm going to hit him with some good shit now. And then I hit him with what I thought was a good shit and they said, this is

Speaker 5:          01:20:08       not what we signed up for. We are out, you're out. And I never got played on radio again. So, you know, that's all stuff that's on them, dude. I know. It's the reason why your music is so well. It's just good. I mean I like, I like a lot of great music and your music is great, but it's also that you, you're clearly coming at this from an artist perspective. You're not a marketing genius by any stretch of the imagination, right? Your Dad's fucking waylon jennings dude. I mean you have the end of all ends. You're dad is like a super legend, you know? I mean these are super, super legend, but you choose to legitimately carve your own path in this the wildest of ways. It's really interesting how you do that and I think that thoughtfulness that allows you to be free like that is also what allows you to explore these like complex issues like censorship or bit coin or any of these things that are like, whoa, this is like, this is some heavy stuff.

Speaker 5:          01:20:58       Like you've, you're, you're, you have a you of a curious approach to these things and in a, in a an ability to express who you really are, right? Which is what, what comes out in your music. It's not like your image, you're just doing what you really feel when you're writing it. That I think that's a, that's a big part of a community that's a big part of being a person. Like let some person uniquely be themselves. And I think there's, this is one of the real issue with social media as people are so terrified of expressing themselves because they're terrified of the hate they get back. But then they get addicted to attacking other people that are failing or other people that are making mistakes. And that I get, I think this again goes with this whole fucking chaos thing that we're talking about before.

Speaker 5:          01:21:42       I mean I think we're in the middle of a storm right now and I think that your, your take on Alex Jones and Bill Maher's take on Alex Jones and what we're saying here about them, it doesn't, it like it doesn't in any way negate arguments that you shouldn't say some of the things he's saying we agree with you. But we also say human beings, we have to figure this out together. And if you start conflict and one great way to start conflict is to ban and to take people down popio call people in Nazi that aren't really a Nazi, like decide that someone's an outright white supremacists when they're really not at all. There are liberal and a Democrat and you know they are, you're saying crazy things you could to try to demonize people and slot them into groups. We have to reject that with every fiber of our being because this is tyranny.

Speaker 5:          01:22:27       This is the type of group tyranny that although it's not connected to a network like the fucking, you know, the KKK or the Democrats or the Republicans, it's still this chaotic group. Think thing that happens. What we decided to go after people and stop being compassionate, stop being just a human being who recognizes that other human beings are flawed and they make mistakes and they do stupid shit, but as soon as you oppose them so vehemently for something that really should be treated with curiosity and compassion and maybe a little bit of understanding and mockery instead of that there's this anger and this vitriol that we just have to put a curb on shitty thinking. I agree. It's kind of like new Roman Colosseum, social media, and it is in a way, but it's also, it's fighting each court, cheering it on. The court of public discourse is massive now.

Speaker 5:          01:23:18       It just opened up a gate. It was a little trickle. It was like that fucking border patrol station in Mexico. It's hard to get in the country, Bro. If you want to do, be that guy or risks his life in the middle of August and take your family through the fucking desert with a couple of jugs of water and you're going to walk and hope you find a job. You know? That's what it used to be like, hey, this is like is the walls came down and they changed the law and everybody said, go ahead in. And everybody's in Wa and the end and down to people going down to up and down. Just opening it up. It's getting crazy. See, this is what everybody's afraid of and this is what, this is what's happening right now with information. This is what's happening for the very first time ever, but between this period of 1994 and 2018 it's been this inevitable change in the way people are able to express information and who gets to express information.

Speaker 5:          01:24:09       You know, they'll question the legitimacy of someone who becomes famous to the Internet but not famous through NBC. He made it. He's on NBC. Meanwhile, this guy is just talking to his Webcam. He has 30 times as many people paying attention to him. Why is he wrong? Why is the incorrect? Because he didn't go through your established channels that have existed with WHO's your gatekeepers? Oh guys like Harvey Weinstein. Where your gatekeepers bitch, get the fuck outta here. You don't get to dictate what's interesting or what's creative or what sounds good. What kind of music people like. It used to be that if you like rock, you didn't like country when I was a kid. You are a loser if you like kiss, right dude, you, you, you would get like categorize. I had to hide some music that I liked and kiss was one of them.

Speaker 5:          01:24:56       I told, I told Paul, Stanley didn't seem to appreciate that. I told Gene Simmons ones too. I was like, dude, I'm sorry. But it was true. I was loyal back when it was uncool to like kiss and then it turned around and became super lawyer of Eddie Bravo has to save story. We both were like embarrassed to be kissed fans, but meanwhile, now I fucking love kiss. I love kiss, but I, you know, I also, I also love Willie Nelson. You know, I love listening to all kinds of different shit. It doesn't connect mutually exclusive. Like for me, I didn't, I grew up with my dad and had country came along. Like once I started living life and I started appreciating the songs, you know what I mean? Uh, like when you started actually kind of understanding the words and all that, and like you, it just, it hits you like, Oh shit, this, this shit is like the heavy shit. It's like there's some deep, deep fucking emotions to country songs. I mean, Johnny Cash just as lyrics alone, like some of his songs are fucking phenomenal men. Yeah. They're phenomenal. Yeah. You know, you know what one always blows me away on

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       cash is the man in black still to this day, the lines like uh, you know the uh, what is it to the thousands that died thinking that the Lord we're on their side and then Harris to the hundreds of the are tens of thousands that died thinking that we were all on their side like that verse and everything. I was looking at it, I forgot to look it up. Hey, would you mind looking up who wrote the man in black? Sorry to ask you that. But I've been dying to know that because I wanted to know if Shel Silverstein was involved or if it was just Johnny Cash at wrote it. But that's such a beautiful song, dude. How about um, well folsom prison blues. All right, of course. Fantastic. But how about God's going to cut you down? Oh, that's miss. These favorite, that's a song. I love that song.

Speaker 3:          01:26:45       That's a song they like chills you to your bone. Yeah. Cause he was an old, old man. We did three songs like the, Oh my God, that's, it. Has that right? The big kind of like, yeah, Jesus Christ. That's good. That one. And the man comes around. Those two were really spoken to her. Oh yeah. Riddick that Shel Silverstein. That's why I was wondering. Yeah. Shell wrote that Shell's like the forgot. He's the guy that brought like the New York sense of humor and, and really cultured writing style, like the kind of hunters Thompson world. He's the link between that and country music for sure. Shel Silverstein, I got to be around him a couple times when I was young. He wrote it. He though cash wrote the signature song man in black. That's good. Social conscience behind his wardrobe choices. Just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back.

Speaker 3:          01:27:35       In fact, he took to black simply because it was easier to keep clean on long tours. Yeah. Look at that. Early in his career, a fellow acts teased him about it, calling him the undertaker. Oh Shit. He was the undertaker for the undertaker was the undertaker. Yeah. These lyrics could really, I mean, there this time right now, seriously. He was a monster man. Johnny Cash some monster. Yeah, he was cool as fuck. He's a monster. Just had a, uh, he just had this energy about him. Are those like colace zero [inaudible] that's a, it's a, um, I like doctor Stevie, a flavored beverage so it doesn't have any calories. It's free guilt, free mouth, pleasure, mouth, pleasure. Um, he had a, he had songs that were, there's so many of them that were just, if you think about the time that he was riding them and to come up through the son scene and Elvis and all that, that was a weird thing.

Speaker 3:          01:28:31       He came in through Memphis. Yeah. Yeah. He's a beast man. No question. And it seemed like he kind of died on his own terms. He died like a man. He died after June died. It was like right after June died. That was also the way he was handling it too, you know? Yeah. I wouldn't do that. Nine inch nails song. Yeah. Hurt. Yeah. Yeah. That was awesome. That was intense. Intense. How I see it. You see if you give us and the mushrooms, the first time I saw that video, I was in my room, my old here in La and the star gun house, that was the pink house over

Speaker 4:          01:29:02       by the Tom Cat Theater on Santa Monica Boulevard. You know what I'm talking about? And, and uh, no Harris Nude, the place where you can go in there. Oh, I heard where's it and take pictures of women. It's Santa Monica and Gardner. Anyway, this little pink house we had over there and uh, I was watching that video on mushrooms and I was like, fucking Goddamn, like, let me see this. You find it. Find the year 2000. When did he, when did Johnny die? I think 2005 or three. No, it was like three of those. And I was living in this apartment on beverly by the Beverly Center and it was like a, I remember that when that happened. Say three, Jamie. Yeah. Um, I saw him there. I got to be random a lot when I was on the road when I was like, I'm the first high women record came out. I was F six, five and we all went on the road.

Speaker 4:          01:30:00       And so like Willie's daughters, amy and Paula, we're out and no, actually maybe they were out. I think there are the cost drivers in a, they had the Christian and said their family and then we went again for high women too. But the one, we were like five year olds. Uh, I wish we could play music on this show. Oh, play the highway man song. Oh Man. Johnny [inaudible] that man a star ship. I flew with damn space bar vide and what? I rushed to the other side, man. Oh man, that was, that was a great fucking album. It was a great song. I have those guys all together. Yeah, it was cool to shit snellman produced that record. It was, it was phenomenal shit. I fly a star ship that's Jimmy Webb wrote that, who wrote, you know, by the time I get to phoenix a Galveston, he wrote a macarthur park, but he wrote all that motherfucker of a songwriter and that sounds kind of about reincarnation.

Speaker 4:          01:31:02       It's like the, his original songs, but one person who lived through these different lives and then he ends up at simple drop or rain. Yeah, Star ship and he was a highway man. Fuck. It's amazing. That's what we're scared. We're scared of being a single drop of rain again. I had scared. It'd be so much fun. I don't know dude. I'm having a good time. I know it wouldn't be easy just to fall for five seconds for sure. For sure. Absolutely. And under the next forever. How about that? I bought for billions of years. How about you go back to me in a single cell organism, you start from scratch, go through and you're like, no way you did it. It doesn't matter what matters is the moment. And that's an impossible concept to grasp for people who collect stamps and a bunch of shit. Your whole it up in your house because you're trying to put like some sort of rigidity to this. Uh, if it theory of world that we live in, you try to put some structure to this and it doesn't, he forgets to enjoy it and I

Speaker 1:          01:31:59       think that is part of the point or earlier too is it's just like, man, everybody, it gets wrapped up. You said you were talking about when you were just afterwards, but you were talking about it. Everybody gets sucked up into a, all these different, you know, fucking confrontations all the time and it's like, and it takes all of your attention. Like I think the reason that alums aren't listened to like they used to be because we used to have so much time, man, he used to sit in your room and that's all you had. And now there's this constant focus. It's like there's a way, and I think the only answer is there's going to have to be some established decentralization of the Internet, the returns it to the form in which all can exist digitally as they do physically, just like we do now.

Speaker 1:          01:32:48       And we're going to have to figure it out as this design. It's coming, dude. I don't think anyone's going to be able to stop it. No. Reg, one of the things that's interesting is that the people at the very top of the heap, um, we always thought were the proponents of free speech. We, we always thought that the, the repressive people where the right wing conservative people that wanted to stop progress and stop nudity and people smoking pot and you know, and Tipper Gore wants a bad rap music. I remember all that. That's what we always thought. It's actually Tipper Gore was Democrats. That's a very bad analogy. Tipper Gore was Al Gore's wife Tipper Gore put this, but she had to speak. She had the stickers. Stickers. Yeah. Explicitly or not some fucking old school ice tea and blew her wig.

Speaker 1:          01:33:35       But we always that that's a bad example because she wasn't democratic it sample, but it is an example of like forget about Democrats or Republicans. It's basically people in power trying to control other folks. This would be this, this, this has been going on forever, right. It's just what people do. But we always thought of it as being the conservative ones that were like the most, the the most into suppression of free speech, you know, stop people you're swearing stopped the knew that he stopped the pornography. It was always thought of as being a conservative thing. But I would argue like today it's almost like your behavior is more restricted on the left than it is even on the right. The right is seemed to be more relaxed in terms of like what they're willing to let people do. But the left is like putting up all these boundaries for like what people can and can't say doing.

Speaker 1:          01:34:22       Don't do, like Tom sent me this, a Thompson, Laura sent me this um, photograph of a, some sort of a sketch comedy group where they were trying to figure out what you can and can't do today and like what, what is okay to do in a sketch? And it was a lot of it was about gay people and Trans People. And can you be a Wa a straight CIS man playing a trans person, all caps? Absolutely not. Can you be assist purse or can you be a trans person playing a CIS person? Yes. All caps. You could do whatever you want. If you're a trans person who's a woman, you can play

Speaker 5:          01:34:58       a man and that's totally cool. But if you're a shooter jennings and you go, you know what man, I just think it would be cool. Do a movie where I play a chick. No chance buddy. You're not allowed to make believe in that way. You can't make believe in a certain way. They're basically saying your, your thoughts are not allowed to go down these roads. There is no way you could manage this respectfully and with with enough people who are crazy. But this is my point. These people exist and they're on the left now. They're like super inclusive, you know, super worried about diversity, super worried about, you know, people of color and there's all these like gain weird words thrown around game words. I wish George Carlin was alive. He would have a heart attack. No, I just want to tell him again. You'd bring them back to life.

Speaker 5:          01:35:46       Tell him again with a hard day. He would say what's similar to what you're saying, what I'm saying? I think, but probably better. He would just tell he'd be so, yeah. I just want to know. I guess it would die to know what he would say. This is, I mean to fucking, to use the title of my tour. These are strange times, legitimately strange times stranger than we've ever experienced before as a human race. I think. Yeah. Oh, I think so. I think we're on the, uh, beginning of it. That's the fucked up thing is I think that like the Cha, the Internet is the thing, the Lynch pin that change society in such a way, like you said, the adolescent phase is what dorm do these dorm of fame. It's a God damn hailstorm. You ever seen those hail storms when they hit those Ohio backyards and fuck up the pool and everybody's in Scott screaming and you're hearing the house, like it's getting attacked by rocks.

Speaker 5:          01:36:34       That's what it is. It's one of those hail storms of information, you know? Yeah, man, there's never been anything like it. It's good. That's good. But we just gotta be nice to each other. We're all together in this thing together. That's the thing too, man. And people are nice. Other people, a nice back. This is the thing. We've got to realize that if you're nice, other people would be nice to, we've got gotta be nice to each other and that includes online, you know, and, and then we've got to be nice about all the other things in the world. There's just so much that has to be thought of it. Someone has to be so much that it has to be thought of. Not with this idea that you're going to live forever because a lot of like the way we behave, it's almost like we think we're going to live forever instead of having the short trip where you're just like kind of be like, is friendly with people pot and this is also something that should be projected.

Speaker 5:          01:37:22       Right. I should projected you should project that. We should all get that idea out there so that we all agree like, yeah, yeah, yeah. It was just fucking, we could do this. Like even competition. It doesn't have to be that kind of conflict. Even if your neighboring businesses, you can be friends and everybody will do well together. There's a lot of people, man, this is not a time we have to control everything and everyone and nor should you want to. It's like a big giant summer camp like life is just one piece of it. That's a good way to describe it, dude, and they have their own summer camp that's going to happen, you know, or are on their way at the beginning of, yeah, these counselors ain't controlling

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       shit. People are finger banging each other out houses, so it gives gay, right. You can't let a bunch of 14 year olds run around the forums together. Fuck every four years. The head counselor changes some guy. It's like last time I was like, Oh, we love that guy and this guy. It's like, no, nobody from the other neighbor camps are coming in. You're like, okay. We vaguely knew when I was in boy scouts, we vaguely knew that there was a potential that one of these camp counselors might molest you. Like people knew. You don't know about him with them. No one ever did. But there was that thought when we were like, I guess I was 13 or something like that and I was in the boy scouts. There was that thought like, hey man, this could go fucking sideways anytime we're in the woods with some dudes, they want to be in the woods with kids.

Speaker 1:          01:38:44       Like how well did they vet these people see different. Really, I have to look at this, write me that. Are these people like legit boy Scout, you know, instructors or whatever they'd be who really want to show everybody the way the woods? Yes, most likely. They're an, it's amazing, amazing experience for young men, but just as human beings, anytime you get human beings, anytime you get a certain group of human beings and you leave them alone with large groups of kids, Yo, you gotta be super careful with what their motives are and how they handle pressure and how they deal with conflict and how they deal with sex. You know, like what do you, you know, you ever molested? Tell me when you were molested, what happened? You know, like these are, these are, right. It's a weird issues when you're talking about dealing with children, dealing with them.

Speaker 1:          01:39:32       The youngest ones are eight and 10 they had see mine mind 70 10 yeah, I mean it's just, it's a weird time when you're watching little human beings evolve and develop and you know, it's her, most of it. Let it go to, you know, like for me, and I know for what the analogy you just had was perfect. It is really like summer camp. But it's funny how it like, you know, from the day you're born, the day after somebody else's stem summer camp starts at, it kind of kind of generationally goes on forever and you kind of like realize that you're stuck in this like movie in which that you have to try and do the best. You know? Like for me it's like do the best with like your family, the people you love and then like have the most fun and do like do the most damage in a good way.

Speaker 1:          01:40:18       Like they, by the way, all the people out there in the summer camp counselors that are mad at me right now, this is now, I'm not saying you're worried about that. You feel bad that the vast majority of your awesome, we're just talking about just in general human beings is the sheer numbers of human beings. If you get a certain number of people, there's a certain percentage of those people that are going to be a problem. You know, this is the problem with cops. It's not, it's not. The cops are bad people. So when you say fuck cops, you're crazy, you're going to need cops. Okay. If something goes wrong at four o'clock in the morning, you want the more, and who has the courage to stand there with

Speaker 4:          01:40:54       a bulletproof vest and shoot at the bad guys? It's the, it's the, you know, sam a Sam, what's his name from three billboards, you know, it was such a good role. You know, I'm talking about that movie three Zam. Who's in Sam? Uh, comedy. So great. Yeah, he was, he did not see that workers guide from the gallon. Oh, Sam Elliot. No, no, no, no, no. We loved not Sam Elliott. Yeah, that's a good one though. Sometimes the gardens, you know what else he was in hitchhikers guide to the galaxy was a great movie called Joshua. He was a z, Z fod beeblebrox. I read over and Jimmy Three Bobo, they'll words.

Speaker 4:          01:41:36       He's, that role is amazing. And he's, he is the moon. Did you ever see that? Oh yeah. I love it. We always kid. Did you, have you met buoys kit? No, the Dunkin Jones. I've never met him, but he's, he's awesome. That movie was awesome. Is that what it's called? The Moon? Yeah, that was great. I met him because he was dating, uh, Leslie Bibb. Yeah, they were dating back then when I worked with her in a movie. Uh, I did, uh, Kevin James Movie, zookeeper with her. I was her ex boyfriend who a douche bag. I saw that fun, fun movie do. She's super cool man. You want to talk about someone? It's funny that girl [inaudible] nights with her, they hang out. Oh, that makes sense. She's super fucking cool. Really smart too. But I'm at Rockwell. That was the thing that I really got to me like a dude, that movie.

Speaker 4:          01:42:25       Yeah. I mean it's fucking amazing. That movie moon. It is a movie. This is, this is how unusual this movie is. There are no other actors. I know. It's amazing. Sam Rockwell through the whole movie and it's a march and didn't, didn't Martian fields emotion feel like kind of like a diet and then when you saw it, well I felt that way even though I didn't cause it was different because it was more about the hazards of colonization and without the psychological align with this movie, I can't give anything away because it's, this movie is a mind fuck at the end. It's great. It's a mind fuck the whole way. It's a mind fuck. I said, Jeez, Diet Martian I or I thought the Marsha was the diet man. Maybe I thought it was just another, well listen man, this is nothing wrong with like doing a take on someone colonizing another planet.

Speaker 4:          01:43:12       We have to be real careful about that. No, no, no. Was, it was a book and everything just for me in my, in my eight year old movie going and seeing in person, I was like, man, it's, it's good. But when like moon, I know there's a problem with, uh, people are scared to do those fucking space movies, do some more goddamn space moves the plane over here. I Watch Alien Covenant Again Five Times. Actually every plane flight I take, I already have them downloaded on this fucking iphone and I watched promethium and that back and forth. You should go to jail. Alien Covenant on it. I know, but you know what? I got it. It's there. I don't have to add the Internet and I have to pay for it. If it's on thing I'll watch it but like you ever used an apple TV.

Speaker 4:          01:43:55       We stream. We fall into that too. That's incredible work. What a lot of work takes two swipes. I know, I know, but look, I feel like that that alien covenant was such a fucking good good. They like canceled or something. I heard that he was had another one alien awakening which is supposed to deal with the time before after per meet the US and into alien. Kevin's supposed to be the ship ride or whatever and I'm like and that they were going to shut it down and crazy. I here's what happens when we get to a certain level of money. When you're investing in those kinds of films threshold. There's a threshold and though, because there's so expensive to make, there's so much CGI and so much chaos and special effects and an alien covenant had a great fucking plot too. I mean everything was great that it was, there's so many twists and turns and the aliens were terrifying.

Speaker 4:          01:44:50       They explained them. I mean there was so much to it. It was read a fucking good. The finger on the pipe prometheus's for a lot of people was less than than what they wanted. That's how it wasn't. There was a bad movie. I really liked it. I thought it was fantastic. They were setting some shit up and it didn't do that well. And we are spending, I don't know how much the fuck they spend on those movies, but they're super, super expensive. It's one of them, I mean aliens to as James Cameron, like blade runner level shit in my opinion in the sense where like at first it doesn't seem like it's a massive thing, but it's just like for life it's that me is fantastic. And the question that it opens and the second piece where I got to shout out to blake judd cause he said, hey man, you're going to see it but you're going to leave and you're going to be mad because you can have way more questions than before.

Speaker 4:          01:45:35       And then I told the same thing to sturge Joel. He was like, I'm about to go see covenant. I was like, dude, you're going to be mad. I wasn't mad at all. No, I'm just saying cause I want to see the next one. I want to know more. Right. You still don't know the engineer thing they see did, that was just one of their planets like our planet and they seated and they went there. So you're like, the next one should, or, or at least like the finishing story they said they wanted make it world war of the worlds kind of thing where it was like all of a sudden these people descend and it's the two opposing kind of parties, which is the David side and then maybe us extending onto the engineer's planet like finally and it's all of a sudden these two opposing forces, you know, so like I think that's brilliant writing. It's fucking fantastic. When you got to realize is that movie the original alien? It goes back to 1979 with sigourney weaver when she was as hot as the surface of the sun. They got the she running shit. She's the original feminist Superhero Gorney weaver, [inaudible] original Badass woman in movies, fucking up monsters. She's the original. All these other movies that came afterwards though the whether they're fun, you love em resident evil type shit or who was that? Kate beckinsale chick was a vampire. I saw those underworld, all those

Speaker 5:          01:46:50       super bad ass chicks in movies. They all, oh, sigourney weaver. She was believable, man. She's a scientist, a scientist or whatever the fuck her job was on that space ship. And she was the only one who lived that movie. Spoiler, it's 1979 trudeau has seen it. But in that movie they were worried about artificial intelligence. That's amazing. Hr, Giger designed all that. She had this space chalky it you stop and think about, they were worried about artificial intelligence back in 1979 and that's like when you talk to Elan Musk, it's like one of his primary concerns. No, he's supposed to do the podcast. I was in his physical presence at the UFC, but I didn't get a chance to communicate with them. He was with his lady, but we had been going back and forth through email, so it was extra weird. Um, but I, I'm, I'm working, you know, when I'm doing the commentary, man, I'm trying to be, I don't want to suck. People get mad at me. I tried to do my best. I've tried to focus. I can't go, yo eat these fights are crazy, bro. There's no really real room for that. But he's worried about artificial intelligence more than anything. And I mean this, you're talking about a super genius. It has an electric car company, a rocket ship, companies drilling holes under the fucking ground. He sells flame throwers. I mean, get the fuck out of here. This is the guy that's worried about artificial intelligence. We should be paying attention. And if you go back

Speaker 4:          01:48:15       too, by the way, there was an article,

Speaker 5:          01:48:19       well, I want to say it was the La Times that compared elan musk to Donald Trump. It was like one of the most click baity articles.

Speaker 4:          01:48:26       They're fighting for their lives out there. Man. These fucking journalists, they're fighting for their lives, good for them. They've got to get those clicks, got all tangled up in this thing. Um, your chain man, uh, I'm, I love guys who are crazy and ambitious and make shit like Elan Musk, whatever is happening with them. The fact that he's like, oh, whatever, I'll figure it out. Let her just let it go. Get it yourself out. That's what's amazing. As soon as you let it go, that's how high you are. And you thought you were tangled, you ain't tangle like an example free bro. You got to break free and these change. Um, no, I just like guys, you know what, I'll talk about spiritual for a minute. I have to shout out to my, uh, uh, the, the, uh, block tronics crew. My, my antsy artists, I was talking about computers and bbs is in block tronics or a antsy artists group.

Speaker 4:          01:49:16       They're great. That sturgeon, it's so cool to watch him come up and he's like, got this kind of angle it like, it's makes me, I just love watching him on your show and I just have to say us hanging out and everything all these years later, he just has a sense where I feel like, wow, there's a rocket ship in this universe and we kind of speak the same language and it's like a cool vibe. Um, kind of having another dude out there who, who has the same sensibilities and like when we hang out, you and me and him and everything, I feel like it's,

Speaker 1:          01:49:54       you know what I mean? Like, I know what you mean about a mother fucker. Yeah, no, I'm honored to be his friend too. Yeah. Yeah. I'm honored to be your friend too, man. For Real. I'm honored to be your friend and you took me. I came to go see you play and you took us in and then Dave Chappelle played right after. You're like, Oh yeah, hey, uh, my friend, Dave's going to do a thing and then you killed it and then he killed it and that was crazy, man. That was awesome. We're all lucky to know each other like it's fun. It's fun to know cool people, but a sturgeon has got some new shit coming out, man. She shared some stuff with me, sent me some, some images and explain what he's doing. I can't wait to hear it. It sounds fantastic. It's going to be a why he sent me [inaudible] can't see you can't say nothing about it.

Speaker 1:          01:50:36       I'm on fucking here. I accidentally leaked the title of his last album I accidentally gave. He sent it to me in advance and I put it up on instagram and I said this new sturgill Simpson Shit. It's off the charts. Yes I did. I didn't know. And then he's like, dude, you fucked up. Oh No. And he was laughing. He thought it was fine. It looks like it. Just let people know about some of the awesome early, but I was listening to it in the gym and a while I was listening to us in the middle of sets and I was like, God damn, this is good. And then I just, I got to instagram this shit and like instagram that I didn't know. Hey, that's cool dude. You did the same thing with my old records.

Speaker 4:          01:51:14       You're like, you put a, you put a picture of it up of your, you just like screen grabs.

Speaker 1:          01:51:18       Yeah, no, I like to do that, man. I was listening. She ate it. Oh, hey man, I appreciate your music for real. Thanks. I was, uh, in um, Italy and I was about to workout. And then you know how you just, you know, you have those I phones without that little, um, the cord with a button. You could press the button. Oh, you start playing whatever you got on your iphone. It just goes right to Kool moe dee. I go, we'll work. You know that song I go to work but at band I'm going to work like a boxer. You know? It's like, it's a great, like I go to work song some about to work out and this fucking song comes on almost like the universe is letting you know, look dude, just, just don't try to think this through too much. Just press that button. The songs there, I don't know why it's there. You don't know why it's dairy that stopped thinking about it. Right. But it's there right when you needed it, that songs there. But at bat I go to work and then you go to work it like it's weird. This is it. This is theater. This whole thing is theater in some sort of strange whatever cat. Yeah, there's some, there's some part of life that's seriously theater,

Speaker 4:          01:52:20       right man. I mean it, it, it, to me the older I get, I just feel like the more appreciative for, for like my dumb herself for having gotten through it without more damage being done. So at this point I'm, you know, like I just really appreciate everybody who puts an effort into the city into life. You know what I mean? So you're like, you feel like somebody is doing good. It's like you,

Speaker 5:          01:52:46       you just, I don't know. It's like you and this show and how like you've had this awesome career and then I only met you the first time when I came on this show and I like smoked pot in the parking lot and I was like kind of out of it. And I was like, oh. And I came here and didn't bring a record. That's why this time I was like, I had to make sure we had a record by record. It's called shooter. It's out now. I have to say something. I didn't talk about it all, but John Hensley, Mary, my manager back then, he called me and said, you didn't even talk about the record once. And I was like, shit, I don't know man. We just got talking. And it was, I mean, that's how it is with you, you know? But I love doing that with you because it's like I'll go down the rabbit hole, man, I'll be on the algae at all and I think people are scared to do that.

Speaker 5:          01:53:26       I think don't use anything wrong with having thoughts. I said we've got to stop yelling at people. Gotta stop yelling. I think this, there's the anger that we expressed towards each other. Forces anger and return when it's not always necessary. Sometimes it's necessary. Sometimes you see Nazis in Charlottesville and you've got to go, hey you dumb fucks. Like are you out of your fucking mind? You really want to categorize people by race. This is 2018 you've got to stop. This is some stupid shit. I think the positive look at all of that is the numbers of those kinds of insane people have dwindled to a point cause I remember when I was a kid and there would be like still clan people and stuff and that's just the argument for free speech. The argument for free speeches. Ultimately it'll figure it out and analysis out.

Speaker 5:          01:54:11       Yeah, it does. I think it does and it doesn't totally because let's just be completely honest. Some people do a terrible job raising children and these children go out into the world and they're just causing damage everywhere they go. They're on fire and they just run it through dry bushes their entire life, right? They're creating chaos and it's from the what set them off when they were young, how they evolve. They expect everyone to have like the, the same starting point and be judged on your emotional behavior, your, your impulsiveness, your, your, your, you know, dishonesty or your discipline to be judged on those as if you all started from the same spot on the board is just crazy, right? It's just crazy. And this is part of what we do. We judge based on results only and when we see someone to fucked up, we don't go, okay, what happened to this person that made them so fucking crazy, right?

Speaker 5:          01:55:05       Like is it really their fault or Zeros? A series of events that lead to you being who you are right now. And maybe we should remap it. Maybe we should remap it and just look at it in a different way and say, look, look, we definitely don't want that result again ever. Right. We've got to figure out why you got to that result. What made you break into the bank and put a gun in someone's face? I mean, how did you get there? That's true. It's like Manson said in the bowling for Columbine. He said, they said, well would you say to the columbine killers? And he said, I would ask, I would ask them their opinion cause it seems like nobody asked them their opinion. You know what I mean? So like yeah, I asked him what the fuck happened. Yeah. Are they both dead?

Speaker 5:          01:55:41       They're both dead, right? Yeah. Can, it's tough to ask them their opinion. I mean it's like, you know, make a love song, but you know, the reality is someone who, who broke like what made you break. We've all broken in little ways in our lives and sure all lived through it and we all appreciate other people who have done the same thing. And when you get to a point when you get old enough where you realize you can watch when someone is having a moment that they can't make it through, that you've kind of been through in ways you kind of find it, you know? Those are the kinds of people that I like that that will go and talk to that person because they can see that and I think that you're absolutely one of those kinds of people because I've actually had conversations with you when we were backstage at the fucking comedy store or wherever we were wounded that night happened.

Speaker 5:          01:56:23       We had a conversation, I don't quite remember the whole thing, but it was about music and about listening to music and it's like you're a compassionate dude and people who that's, that's all it's about compassion. It's about compassion and stability. It's about recognizing the best times come when we're nice to each other. If you go to a bar and there's a bunch of strange dudes you never met in your life and an hour later you guys are high five and then laughing and hugging each other and you're buying rounds, that's a great time. Or you can go to a bar and someone wants to get a dick wave and competition. Next thing you know you got hit in the back of the head by a chair. That's possible too, right? You know both things are possible. You know when one feels way better. The one that feels way better is the one where you meet, meet a bunch of new friends and then these guys you never met before and now your buddies and then you realize like I just ran into a fucking bunch of awesome dudes who are now some of my favorite people ever.

Speaker 5:          01:57:12       And if I didn't go out that night, who knows what would've happened? Just randomly ran into a group of amazing people and change the course of your whole life. That's possible too, man. But we got to be that friend at the bar. We got to be that new friend. At the bar and the more people it's possible to do that, man. And I think a lot of it is just the way we think of each other. There's a, there's a problem in our operating system or we have a ultra competitive operating system and things we shouldn't be competitive in. There should be. Then I think part of the reason is we've lost a lot of competitiveness in life. I think people were competitive in life in ways where there's fighting for their survival, right? They're fighting neighboring tribes the most brutal and primitive of days.

Speaker 5:          01:57:51       Azure media. Yeah. And then as things changed and move forward, that got less and less physical and more and more mental in the body got frustrated and I think this is part of what's happening along the way. And then people started looking for competition in business. You ever hear like Weirdo business guys talk, we're going to fucking stuffed our contract right up there. They get all crazy. Like they're starting a war man. You know, like super hyper hyped up business guys. Got My competition has always been disparaging me, which you know, all those jerks about my past, you know, they get fucking so that they want to kill the competition. Those people are weird bed. They're weird. They're focusing on it the wrong way. There's some some dinosaur shit. Yeah, yeah. That's, well that's the money thing. That's like if you're in the money game, yeah. But you don't have to do that to be in the, even in the money game, you don't have to do that anymore. Like I, yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:58:42       you're right. But I mean, but if you do, you know what I mean? Like you do something you love, you pursue angles. Like you chose to pursue lots like similar to me where it's similar in this way. Like you've chose to pursue all these little different angles of the universe that are in the entertainment business, but they are also like things you love like the UFC and then, and then you know all the different little, I mean you've, you've had so many different little angles that you've occupied land up here where you get to just talk about all this shit that you love. It doesn't make sense. Even to me, I wake up in the morning, like today I wake up, I go and work out and I'm sitting there going, what am I doing? I'm just looking at this place shopping. What's fucking awesome? It's crazy.

Speaker 4:          01:59:24       Like honestly, I wake up in the morning like, how'd this happen? You have an archery thing. I would have old computers and that wall and I would have like a pinball machine and a bunch of old arcade games. I have my own taste, but like you got, honestly, it's, it's a, it, you have found your path and, and it's awesome and you're compassionate and you're here and you, you weren't in it. If you were in it for the money, you'd be somewhere else. You're in it for what you like to, didn't even know what I'm doing. I don't know why minute you're talking for me right now. [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          01:59:58       second warning, you're going to be a great dad and then you're going to go do what you love to do and come home and, and that's awesome. I just do what the great magnet compels me to do. I'm, I'm merely metal filings moving through the universe and credit towards the great mascot metaphysical Neri, Magna last 10 sure I made, I've decided, one of the things I've been thinking about recently, especially over the last, like maybe 10 years of my life, I've decided way less things that I did in the [inaudible] what I need to seems to me things just sort of happen. So, you know, first the Bob Seger thing, I moves, I just tried to make some fun travel. Yeah. My, my kids excel past me are ready all the time cause yesterday, I mean they trick me and they do things and they're smarter and there and you know, nothing I could do could impress them more than what they can do by watching what I can do and doing it better.

Speaker 4:          02:00:51       Well, how about when they do, they fucking grab electronics. They figured out. That gave me that you don't know how to do it. She got to go into settings and you go to here and you're like, what? You're eight. Can you do this? My daughter programs, the log off in minecraft you can program these blocks blocked. Oh yeah. Yeah. I have to shout my RC people. Oh yeah. Our, you still use IRC? Yeah, I'm still, do you have a ham radio in your backyard is a BCR my record label that I owned with Adam, uh, there's a BCR IRC. What does that, the dcrs black country rockets, the label that put out this records on Electra through lcs and, and uh, Dave Cobb, his label. Yup. There we go. Uh, I keep looking at the cameras that are not this place. It's too freaky. Used to have the cameras on while we were on but it's too weird.

Speaker 4:          02:01:41       Hard to be yourself. Um, I think they were on actually last time cause that was too weird too. Freaky freaked everybody out. Especially when we'd started getting high. And you're like what? This is not right, but we have a thing called a know the BCR bizarre DOTCOM BCR be a z a r.com and it's like a place where like fans come and they talk and we have an IRC server. So there was one all day and I'm on it all day and I talked to Pete. So ridiculous. You just gave people that out. Now people are going to go there. I hope I welcome please. I used to do a CRC back with my quake days. Oh yeah. Great way to communicate. Like teams would communicate with you like server addresses are all going to meet up at that show is free as fuck. The inner, the government didn't even know how to fucking trace a phone.

Speaker 4:          02:02:22       Literally like listen in on IRC back then. Like they had to pick up from the hackers. Like how to do it. That was a very, very different thing when those, all those message boards and all those things came up like uh, especially like the ability to, we play games and talk to people in real time during the games. [inaudible] I'm one of the ways I've learned how to type was from learning how to type in game play quick cause you got a tight quick quake one or like quick what was known and what was it? Started with quake two, quake to multiplayer could wake one. I mean I was in doom so like when quake one came out and I was nine inch nails, my favorite band ever and Lynn went back then and still was the influence for me. Like he did the soundtrack. I think I was a moldy shit.

Speaker 4:          02:03:08       Amazing. It's funny that all these years later she's like, I didn't have a computer but I went and bought that sand because Trent reznor did it cause she was into nine inch nails and I'm like, it's so hot. Oh she has the CD of it in our house still. But anyway, man, I loved that and I used to do that too. And once the Internet came on, I had a friend in Nashville, me and my buddy James and Greg, greg, this guy ran a bbs and he bought a doom to server back then where you had had four phone lines and modems in it and dial in 56 k days. Totally. And we would play doom two and listen, I was listening to like um, White Zombie Astra creep 2000 as probably 14, 13 just jam and this shit out man. I was such a nerd. Still am man. If you saw my house, you got to come over some time.

Speaker 4:          02:03:54       But I've got like my office is like 1993 we watched laser disks, we have like old computers and like old shit everywhere. So it's like I kind of, it's kind of frozen in a a weird technological phase that I love. That's hilarious. That's awesome man. Yeah, you've always been like really into like weird Internet type shit. Like he really ended the cryptocurrencies and there's a thing called peep, peep, peep eth. It's on twitter or whatever. But it's, it's a twitter alternative. It's like, it's, it's just, just starting that. It's interesting. Peop e t h e t h.com is the thing. It's, it's like kind of like twitter, but it's built on the back of the theory them. And so every tweet or I'm going to have a calling them tweets, I should call it. What are every message that you send on it? Kind of like twitter is embedded in the blockchain of etherium.

Speaker 4:          02:04:54       Well, this is to explain what this site says. It says the values platform. Hold on. What did you do? So we just uh, a blockchain powered social network for our best selves. Yeah. Well it because you can't delete anything because it's permanently embedded in, it's like, I think up to 10 of your messages can be logged in one block of the theory and chain. So you have to pay like a cent of it, but they give you some to begin with. And then when somebody messages you, it's kind of a metric microtransaction to you. So you have this kind of balance. It's going all the time. So do you have to open up an account? You get a sense you can do it without any involvement. But the way it works is because it's in transactions on a blockchain and ethereum, it's, it's permanently lodged in this permanent digital ledger in which that these transactions are what's making it happen.

Speaker 4:          02:05:49       So like if you'd, you log in and verify yourself, they give you like 30 cents because that starts you out to be able to just kind of permanently do this end. So you don't have to do any, it sounds complicated but it's cool. I'm not saying I don't, I don't know if it will become like the next rage, but it's technologically, it's a really fucking fun. Might be launching it right now. Go back to that page again and expand on the right hand side where it shows you all the different categories and the different values, but make that a larger social media bringing out our best with opinionated features and immune immutability. Hmm. Yeah. How often do you hear that word? It's permit. I mean not the ability to not mute. I believe immutability. So you can't mute people. Okay. Co we'll need to google that in a moment.

Speaker 4:          02:06:39       Contact is openly and forever accessible on the ethereum, blockchain and ipfs, whatever that is. Thoughtful. It says permanence and creative constraints. Encourage, mindful and self aware. Peeps. They'll kid that was like a Haiku. What does it that's like a fucking poem and let some of this fucking thing under. Listen to this. Again. Permanence and creative constraints. Encourage mindful and self aware. Peeps. That's okay. Is I just stumbled across it, but I love it. I love the technology. I do too. But I mean that was, I don't understand what they just said. Uh, charity be responsible. Charity badges prevent suffering and inspire others. 1000, 178 mosquito nets purchase so far. Oh that's amazing. So they're making their purchasing mosquito nets. Now that that has to do with the, uh, the actual platform. I think it's not a real mosquito net. Don't think, Oh, I

Speaker 1:          02:07:36       thought responsible matt to this website. I have no, they tried to do her thing. Okay, well they are there. They're buying mosquito batches to prevent malaria. I'm getting paged cause they ain't go to Conan. Oh, it's over. I know. I don't want it to mark. I don't want it to be over either shooter. We've gotta do this again. Yeah. I led them on man, and uh, I'm, yeah, I'm glad you started off that controversial subject of the Alex Jones thing. And I'm really glad that Bill Maher went out on a ledge and said, you know, even if you don't agree with someone, you're not supposed to silence or speech. You know, I just don't think people were supposed to be alone yelling into the wilderness. I agree. This farther mentality, you know, is a problem. Even him, I don't think you're supposed to be able to do that. I don't think he's supposed to be alone yelling off into the abyss. My wife's calling me now because he's telling his club. Everyone's freaking out. Everyone's freaking the fuck out. It's just time, ladies and gentlemen. It's a way of measuring distance. Thank you for having me to jennings your shit. I love you too, brother. A shooter. It's out now. She are Janie's outcome this, uh, this shit's vinyl, old school son. Respect all.
