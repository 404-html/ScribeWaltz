Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience and I realized why I'm so fucked up. It's wrestling. That's what fucked up your head. Oh, it just made me crazy. Sitting some hot ass room, fucking getting tortured and getting beat up. My, my coach is a world champion at 17 from Iran and then he left. He left the country and then couldn't wrestle in the Olympics, which she probably would have won because he didn't have his green card, so he would bring in all these super bad asses to just kick the shit out of me. My whole high school career, they have a deep, deep background in wrestling. Man, they fucking tortured me, Ron. It's just,

Speaker 2:          00:32          I remember the iron sheik. Yes, she legit wrestling. She was the legit wrestling. I had them in a car. I'm not kidding you man. He was a world class for like an hour. He's a good dude, man. Is. He came on stage with me in Toronto. I did this. We'd store this. We'd show in Toronto. They do the show. It's like the underground comedy show. They do it in a weed store and the weed store is up like a bong shop in the front and a comedy club in the bag. And you go into the back and you can't see 10 feet in front of you. You are in the clouds. Man. I'm not joking. It's ridiculous. It's the worst hotbox ever. No ventilation whatsoever. Every now and then again, they opened up the back door so nobody dies. That's it. There's no air Arab shoes. All you're breathing, you're breathing in, breathing out weed. It's, the whole room was filled with wheat and the iron sheik was in there getting high as fuck. And he came on stage while I was up there. He came in and fucking this, this is all your video of it online. It's hilarious. Uh, me and him just talking to them

Speaker 1:          01:40          stage. But yeah, Iranians. So imagine me at 15, 16 cut weight. You're fucking Sana. And I have some 40 year old Iranian dude massaging me, read my backend and credit card down all my sweat. And people look at us like, what the fuck? Why is that man?

Speaker 2:          02:00          Hey Sir, you can't buy him that way. He'd be muttering to meet the Farsi. You can't just scan him, sir. Do you want to fuck him? You're going to have to hold him down. Oh boy. I realized the same 24 hour fitness we always went to in Aliso Viejo was a gay hangout hollow. This is getting married. Betty and I worked out at 24 hour fitness and there was this dude who was the manager there. It was a cool guy. We just talked to him and uh, they had sent him over from the Santa Monica Place. He was like a real personable, real friendly guy. Like he, you know, real easy to like. And so, uh, the Santa Monica police brought him in because they needed to get that place cleaned out because it had basically become just a fuck house. Close the shower, hose them down everywhere. It'd be common condoms. But my buddy ended up working. That's how I find I, but it ended up working at the same place and they used to have to trap dudes, gay dudes that were fucking in the sauna and stuff

Speaker 3:          03:05          and raped [inaudible] the cops came because it was relatively stations. How people die, Bro. Don't trap me in the [inaudible] out of here, man.

Speaker 2:          03:30          You know what's incredible? I'm looking at, and he starts about three rows up. Check out the people three rows and beyond looking at fat. Do you guys have no fucking idea what Atlantic city is? I've never been hell first time ever been white trash in from all fucking ports. It's 15 to get on the bus and to go to Atlantic city. Here's the clinker, they give you $10 in quarters when you get to Atlantic city. So they basically give you $10 back. Then they give you a book of coupons for another 50 to eat to try to keep you there all day. So if you go, let's say at the eight o'clock in the morning bus, you can't leave till five whether you're broke, whether you wait all your coupons, you cannot go back on the [inaudible] the rules, they have a scam every fucking hour on the hour from all points in New Jersey and New York buses go down to Atlantic city right now.

Speaker 2:          04:33          Half those people sitting there, I've already lost that money and they're just killing time to the midnight bus and somebody from the UFC just happened to give him a nice tickets. They're sitting there, they don't even know what the fuck bookmaker, who's going to win the fucking the Yankee game because that's how they're going to bounce back on Sunday and they could go down the shore and they look at them. They're mummified. It looks like a fucking old and this is silver right there. That's Atlantic City for you. Where's fucking Dana and this room where they bought a gun? It's good body shot. Where's Dana White? He ain't, nobody reads fine yet. They haven't showed him the FERTITTA brothers fuck off. They were in that room to hide that hide in the main, like like Fox sports fights. It comes out for that. Like towards the end, like when we have that thing where we sit down, we start breaking down the fights in the main card. That's when he comes back. Oh Linacre. Oh that you can take it though, man. He seemed to some hard shots standing his ground, man. These guys are sweating hombre. Brennan fucking Dana White comes in like deliver on Goodfellows shaking hands towards the end. Shaking hands, boy that people pointing at people.

Speaker 2:          05:54          How about that? He never hit him. He had him, he had him flattened down. He had his back and he's not crashing him. He's not blasting with punches. He's got him flattened down and he's not hitting him. That doesn't make any sense. He's also, he also had a full, he had a full head joke. They know, but he's also 51 that's true. And a fighter 51 that's true. You'd, you'd a hundred percent correct. And I was like, I watched everyone. Right. I'll watch all the Bella tour. I'll let y'all UFC. I'll watch everything, so the bell tour when, when the entrance is, I was like, this is so dope. The, it was kind of like the pride and all that. Then I was on board.

Brian, how big can surveys to tissue is second to none. He's really handsome, doesn't he can turn on a nun. Don't ever play with me.

It's just those numbers in the idea of what you're trying to do and then there's all the physical shit cause some people are just born with different bones. They just built, some people are born like Haji Gracie, these long ass fucking arms. They can just cinch Darcy's in from anywhere long triangles. They can get both your fucking arms trapped in like in a dead orchard.

It's going to be on motherfucker will also the amount of people that were paying attention to that because they felt like Mike Tyson got railroaded. Like that was a, that was a questionable decision. Like what had happened to him, the lawyers sort of strategy for dealing with the case was that the girl should have known, she should've known creation is going tell room that she should have known. But also she should have known because of the guy that Mike is like the strategy was to like make it look like he was just a bad guy. Look, you should know. He's like, he's out there Merkin dudes, you know, we'll go watch the Marvis Fraser fight and expect to, what do you think's going to happen to get alone with that?

So my lower back and he goes, he goes, so he's massaging me and he's touching everywhere but my feet and my is weird. My feet, I mean my, my back, where's he saw my feet, my legs. Then he starts talking about my ass and then he goes, you hold a lot of tension here. And I'm like, okay, this feels good though. He's like a massaging my glutes. And then he goes, he goes, I swear to God. He goes, so now this is going to be weird. Maybe in the beginning you have a nerve center, you have a nerve center right next to your prostate.

Speaker 1:          17:01          And he goes to, what I do is I'm going to get right up here and he goes, how'd to get it right up there with my fingers and I'm in a massage the area. And what's gonna happen is you're going to let go completely, but you've got to really let go. Start letting go now. And I go, I was w, what do you mean? He goes, I'm going to put it, I'm going to put it, I'm going to have to go in your anus. And I'm say, and I go, no, no, no, no. I got to know what it's okay. Because for me, I'm, I'm more tight here.

He let a guy finger your ass and then blow you. That is a gap. I would imagine. That's how, that's what I would say. No experiment sex. Not to be, but I was in college and I saw him have sex with a girl. I had sex in a room where you know you're younger, you're like, oh, we can't afford a hotel room. We got to share one. Right. I'm having sex. He's having sex with a girl, do it. He bangs girls as well. He banged girls at guys well, well and hard and he was working at peace. I know dudes go both ways, but he left a guy blowing and I don't give a shit what his fingers. Right. This is a guy who hasn't done that other in other places.

Speaker 1:          18:54          Just did it this one time or what's that? Look guys, I don't know man. We didn't really talk about it after that. We were like, that's not the first. That was the one that's like, you know what man, we'll give him a pass. Hold down the control. Did you find out that he got blown by the, he the guy who did it, told my buddy Dan, very, very confidentially, very confidentially because Dan, my buddy was Dan. I also got fingered in the bucket. Dan is a little guy and he goes, she used to hang out with them straight. I was fucking tricky university Dan goes, so dang good. So, so check it out. He goes, there are a lot of people in here in your midst that have had things with guys. I was like, like, who? And he goes, well don't tie it back.

Either you forget the stories and gay guy who tried to finger your ass as soon as hold this other guy. This is where the guide or finger his ass and blow them. But that guy never admitted it to anybody else. No. So how do you know if it's even true? The Guy, he's a trickster. You said the guy wasn't even the way she did it because he only told my other friend who was gay. It was gay. Made him say not tell anybody because he's lying. It could easily be because he's alive and he's got a fantasy of blowing your heart ass. Jordanian friend made the story up and then you had bay tells you like it's look guy blows everybody good. Let them blow yet. Yeah, but it was the next thing you know the guy who was a new assay close. A big secret. He didn't want the Gig. I didn't want anybody to know. He told, cause you probably thought your friend would kill him. The Jordanian friend. I mean he's a Middle Eastern guy. It's very likely Zeus or not. Yeah, no he was soft, weak bro.

Speaker 1:          20:42          Crew was pretty a bit about bisexuals that I don't think they really exist. I think there's gay dudes and then there's really gullible straight dudes who get talked in to blow and crafty gay dude, this guy is like making my act real. That's probably true. That's what a bisexual is. There's guys that just crap this fuck my friend Jimmy used to say they're just greedy. That's what he used to say. Well, like bisexual is their fucking greedy. Just just one. Everything. Eh, Kimmy, Kimmy, he's like PME, Cammie picket team. He just liked attractive people. Well, this guy, um, do you still Facebook them every night?

He goes, he goes, it's something you have to work up to and it's something that I, I think I can read almost had you for a little bit where you're like, yeah, maybe I, I was like, that would be weird. How would I do that? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          21:51          Wait, I'm going to tell you something else. I'm making this up now that I remember it. I blocked some of it actually he did massage my tank. [inaudible]. I swear to God he massage that area because he told me that area is where a lot of tension and I was like, this is awful. I remember my toes kept pointing. I don't know. I was like, Oh, oh, oh God.

Speaker 1:          22:36          He got arrested for prostitution. When I don't eat crackers with the crackers down. This is great. I just felt the other day, but everybody thinks that it was fighting, so I was like, people like you got arrested? Yeah, why? I was fighting. I have a whole story about prostitution now. Well, no it wasn't, but that wasn't, I was not trying to pick up prostitutes. I see the story that you tell me what he was doing. I have paid for sex. Now anyone who knows me knows that and I believe in it. I just haven't done it. Believe in it. I think it's a really, it does exist. It's not Santa Claus. That's true. And, and I don't do it. I don't do it in my adult years because I don't want to, I don't, it doesn't turn me on. And for a lot of reasons I just don't want to be part of it.

Speaker 1:          23:17          But you're married. Well, yeah, but even if I wasn't married, I wouldn't do it because I have my own responsive. You want someone to be attracted to you? Yes, it is. I don't want to contribute to someone else's destruction. There are a lot of reasons. I have a philosophy behind it. It doesn't matter. But, but, um, I come out of, uh, Jimmy Burke's apartment. It's late at night. I am literally been on a plane and these, these two blondes were in a car and I look in and I go and they go and I go, hi, what are you doing? I go now months and Emilia, I'm like, hmm, interesting. And I figured, man, I think, I dunno. They look kind of hug, hug her, and they go, you want to have a good time now to go? How much? And they go, how much do you have?

Speaker 1:          23:57          And I go, I dunno, $5,000 how's that sound like? That's silly, right? So they go, sounds great. We'll be right here. I go, okay, I'm going to go right to the bank machine and the other, of course you can. So I go to the [inaudible] machine, by the way, to get to cash. I had no cash to get in a cab and go home. Guess what? I go to the bank machine guess was waiting for me. Bunch of cops. Guess what those calls were? Cops. It was a sting operation and they caught me and I looked the cubs and go, you guys are really going to arrest me. I said, $5,000 guy goes, yeah, I know that. Here's the problem. You got caught up in the suite. We've got to take in sat next to a guy who was dressed like a woman who was trying to pick up women and he was peeling his knee.

Speaker 1:          24:38          He was so nervous. He was peeling his a nail Polish off. I spent uh, two days in jail. It was a lot of fun and I thank God there were there to protect and serve that do a class for John's for um, where I had to go to a class for a, you know, whatever. Like, you know, for John John's, for people that this is also a story you should be telling on stage. Kind of funny way to, well just unbelievable pick up prostitutes. Someone can come up to you and ask you if you want to have a good time and then when you respond to that, but it's better to show. The cops were cool. They were like, Bro, I mean look for me. By all means. I get it. The problem is you got caught up in the sweep in and they were like, don't worry about it.

Speaker 1:          25:27          They're like, it'd be knocked down to a misdemeanor just to, it's a pain in the ass. I know. They were all cool. I mean, you know, but, but you were in jail for two days. That's not a misdemeanor and I had to make up a story up next to you on a call and say shit like that. You gotta know that they'll park. They were parked. Yeah. I think music, video type shit. That shit don't exist. It does exist though. That's the problem you hear about and fucking penthouse letters and maybe this is the time when I was getting married the next day or something and I wedding would be over. I mean know there's all kinds of shit I just learned when girls go, Oh, you want to party. They're now talking about dancing to some tunes as well. Do a little drugs.
