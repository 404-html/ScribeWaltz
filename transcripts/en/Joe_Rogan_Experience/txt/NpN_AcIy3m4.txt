But with me undies you can get really good underwear delivered to you. Now this is where it's fucked up.

Speaker 1:          00:03:47       Okay? I'm not scared of my own farts. I cut them loose. So seven years of filter and farts. I just do not trust any washing machine to to like really do a good job enough to, I comfortably set my balls after seven years and that kind of a filter.

Speaker 2:          00:05:08       The gentleman. That ad works so good. I'm on their website right now. Are you? You're like, yes. That phone is pretty done. Haven't done. I haven't really made this happen. I've been neglecting, not that it'll buy new underwear, but I haven't had a technological jump and underwear for so long.

Speaker 1:          00:05:27       Yeah, I haven't either. You know, one of the things I learned from you from hanging out with you is the power of wool and, um, I've been trying to frame, yeah, you're trying to find good wool socks. Like athletic socks. Yeah. Do they have them?

Speaker 2:          00:05:39       They do the Rehab Merino blend. You may get like a thinner Merino blend. They have like athletic socks, like, I don't know. I don't know if it's that, I don't know if they qualify him as athletic. I like, I've never seen one. It's meant for like going to the gym. They're always kind of meant for like, they'll call them light hiking.

Speaker 1:          00:05:55       Oh No. That's why I need some light wool because it seems like that's what you should have. Right. So, I mean, that's all I wear now. It's the best first fruit. I'm still stuck in the ice age or the, what do you call it, with stone ages? Underwear. Anondi's man. But first light, they make a Merino wool boxer. Oh, that people love. Yeah, I would imagine. First light's great. Um, that's l, I t e is it l? I t. T. Yeah. light.com marina wool boxer. But for reasons I don't, I, I, I could tell you about them. I need to, I need something that's nice and I wear a nice tight fit and pair of underwear. He too. Yeah. I don't want my ball was hot and humid. That's what I'm saying. And uh, last but not least, we're brought to you by tig. Uh, if you go to rogan.ting.com you can understand what ting is all about.

Speaker 1:          00:06:41       Ting is a cell phone company that uses a sprint backbone and they cell phones. You don't, you know, like Lisa phone from them. So if you cancel, you're done. If you decide to, uh, you know, you no longer want to, we'll use ting. You own that phone, that's yours. Um, and they have no termination fees, no contracts, all the bullshit that's usually connected to cell phones. They don't have any of that. With Ting with ting does is they decided to rent time on the sprint backbone. So you using sprint service. But they do it their way and their way is definitely going to save you money. 98% of people would save money with Ting. I use Ting Ting is the official cell phone of this podcast. I just got my newest one recently and it is, uh, I fucking love it. It's the Samsung Galaxy s four.

Speaker 1:          00:07:28       It's a little smaller than the one you got this one right here? Yep. What do you have to note? Yeah, my and my new me undies looked good on there, man. The note is pretty dope. But what I like about this, it has a Builtin, um, built in, um, a heart monitor right there. It's a pulse detector. Finds out what your heart rate is like. Don't just put your finger on it, put your finger on there and it has apps that go along with it and it's also waterproof. That's one of the reasons why I got or water resistant and should say they don't see this little tab. There's tabs shuts down and boom. And that's just sent to me by tank. This is the official cell phone of the Joe Rogan experience podcast. Um, what they do is they charge, this is one of the reasons why you saved money is a lot of companies like if you, um, if you've got a plan like get a hundred minutes a month, if you use 80 of those minutes, you don't get any credit for those 20 minutes.

Speaker 1:          00:08:14       If you use 120 minutes, they charge you extra. You get like an overage fee. Tang has none of that. You only use what you pay for. And 98% of people would save money with Ting. That's a real figure. I have had no one who's used ting that has not told me it's a way better service as far as like saving money. And again, you're using sprint, so it's not like some rinky dink cell phone service where you're not going to get good coverage. $21 is the average monthly bill per device for 10 customers. And they have, if you go to the shop, uh, at a rogan.ting.com there are all sorts of different cell phones to choose from, from the really cheap, you can get like a wonky ass little tiny smart phone like to HTC evo four g 49 bucks. You can even get a flip phone.

Speaker 1:          00:09:00       They still sell flip phones, Samsung, uh, m 472 bucks, little flip phone. Or you can get us an apple iPhone and they have the full range. You can get like an iPhone four if you're not, if you're like, I want an iPhone but I don't need the latest shit, just give me something cheap. You get that for 95 bucks. Or you can go all the way up and get like the latest and greatest like the Samsung Galaxy s four or s five, the sound, the galaxy note, which is, um, the note three, they have that for sale as well. They have all the latest and greatest android devices. So go to rogan.ting.com and you'll save 25 bucks off of those. All right, we're done with commercials. Steven now is here, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to get down to business. We're going to talk, not even business.

Speaker 3:          00:09:43       Well like bullshit experience.

Speaker 4:          00:09:47       Try my day. Joe Rogan podcast by night. Brian Cowen was going to try to make it here today. Oh really? But he um, he had some podcasts. He's scheduling advance. I tried to get him to cancel but he couldn't lease your bed. But he's very excited to come in those till Laska and that should be a nice silly trip

Speaker 3:          00:10:04       man. I'm, I'm looking, I'm excited about that trip. It really is. When you get up into that, when I say that when you get up into the Alpine zone, like the above timberline in southeast Alaska, it really like, you know, it's cooler looking than like the walk forest, you know? I mean it's just as amazing because you have this like you go from old growth stuff where you could, like the three of us could all stand around, joined hand to hand and you couldn't reach around these trees, you know? Wow. And you climb a little higher and it's like boom. It's just like wide open and there's, there's really nothing like it. I mean, you can't, you just can't fathom the beauty of it, you know? Well, I've seen it on your show

Speaker 1:          00:10:46       where you went hunting blacktail deer, right when you land on a float plane and then you go up into the, uh, into the, the upper regions. That was where the fog rolled in. And you had that nice deer in your scope.

Speaker 3:          00:10:57       No wait. You know, that that time when I was up there, there was a wind storm. The wind was so bad, it made the front page news and town and I'm 70. They, they, they kept saying like 70 some mile an hour winds blew down a bunch of phone poles the next day, uh, uh, a pilot came up to kind of fly over to see if we were still alive and everything. You know, he just kind of cruise around a check. It was, that's the thing is the weather. So when we go on this trip, we could either just get, we can either have the worst time or the best time depending, you know, I mean just depending on the weather, it can be so just uncomfortable and miserable or it can be just beautiful. And there's places back in there. You know, principals island is huge.

Speaker 3:          00:11:36       It's the, I think by some definitions, either the second or third or fourth biggest island we have. What's interesting about it that island is, it has, you know, half the, sir, I think it's half the surface area as Hawaii, the big island in Hawaii, but has like three times the coastline. Whoa. Just, you know, it's just a crazy like fjords and inlets and bays. But there are places in this island that you, you can't really, there's no road system in la, in La and a lot of it, and there's places you can't fly to because there's no lakes to land and it's really hard to walk there. So sometimes you're looking at, there's mountains there and you're like, I guarantee that no one, you know, you can't guarantee it. But I mean like for a hundred years it's probably, no one has stepped foot on that thing because you really had, we'd have to get to one place and you'd have to get a boat and carry it through and go across to another place and then climb up.

Speaker 3:          00:12:30       Well, it'd be mostly just climate. Like you just, when you, if you fly over some of those mountain tops and you look around, there's, this is no way. I just know that no one's been there unless you could land up, lets you can land up there on a lake, you know, we'll land not will land in a spot. And I want to just walk from there and I think we will walk up into stuff that, that people haven't walked there. I mean, there's always some crazy thing he didn't know about, but we're going to walk into some stuff where people just have not walked. Well, you know, you can stand around places there and say, I like, you know, I feel very certain that I'm like definitely the first guy to ever have his feet sitting right here. I can't discount something that happened, you know, hundreds and hundreds of years ago.

Speaker 3:          00:13:14       But there's just some wild stuff in there. Wow. It's, it's uh, you know, right now I've got mixed feelings about too, but they just, the forest service up there just announced they're going to be, uh, open up cut up there. 6,000 acres of old growth for clear cuts. Yeah. Wow. That's kind of fucked up dude. I understand every single, I understand every single argument for and against. I understand every single argument. What's for, what's the good aspect of it? The economics. I mean, that's like you used to have a thriving logging industry based around Tongass, you know, Tongass national forest. So it just atrophied. Right? So it's a job creation thing, you know? I mean that, that's the for the forage is just people that live there have an access to like a good paying job. The downside is we have just a minuscule fraction of old growth left, you know?

Speaker 3:          00:14:05       Yeah. Just, I don't see why anybody would allow that. I mean, I understand the economic thing, but I always feel like there's gotta be another way to make money. What's weird too is Tom has just said recently that over the next decade they're looking to phase out old growth logging at the same time that they are announcing and pushing forward with plans to do a big 6,000 acre clear cut sort of sort of acknowledging on one hand they they want to get out of it or need to get out of it or can see into the future that need to get out of it. And An air hammer being like, but we'll have one last Hoo Rah, I got one last party. And you're dealing with, how old do you think these trees are? I mean these, you know, there's the, I can't speak specifically to that particular area, but I mean there's like Doug firs that are much older than, than the birth of this nation out and cedars.

Speaker 3:          00:14:53       I mean, you know, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years old. That's huge. Giant trees. Chop them down and make what? It's sad man. But you know paper, like everything gets so weirdly, we've talked about this before on the show, how things get so convoluted, like one of the big, just to bring it back to us, going on a hunt for CYCA black tail deer, like they'll sick a black tail deer when we're going to look for him, we're going to be looking for him up in the Alpine, which they'll be leaving. So there'll be leaving around the time we're going there. That stuff's still has snow. Like we're, we're going to be looking for deer will still have snow in June. Okay. Then it melts off and there's long days and it turns like beautiful and it gets very vibrant and green. There's all kinds of succulents and deer come up out of the timber to feed around in there and then in October it snows.

Speaker 3:          00:15:41       So you have like a couple snow free months in October it snows and those deer all split. Traditionally what those deer want to do is they want to go down and spend the winter down in old growth because the old growth canopy allows for a kind of a, you know, a snow free sheltered understory where they're, you know, down on the down in the ground and they'll hang out in that old growth timber. So an argument against the cut would be that we need it for deer. And a further argument would be the reason we need to protect deer habitat is because we needed to protect the wolves out there. And some people right now are trying to make a push to say that the wolves in the Alexander Archipelago of which Prince of Wales island is a part that those wolves are genetically extinct and they therefore deserve a level of protection, like their own level of protection that they would get endangered species act protection out on these islands when other people are arguing.

Speaker 3:          00:16:38       It's just the same wolf man. I mean it's like you got wolves all over. It doesn't like that population doesn't deserve any specific thing. So it winds up being that people who might be pushing against the timber sale might wind up also be angling for protecting wolves out there from hunting and trapping. And then you're left to be like, well, I'm not really comfortable with the timber sale, but I'm not really comfortable with you using biological lumping and splitting in order to like close down certain sorts of hunting season. So it winds up being that all your friends aren't necessarily, you know, like the enemies of your enemies aren't necessarily your friends. Wow, wow. Wow. So anyways, we're going into that area and hunt some black tail deer and there's a health is a good healthy population. You know, it's still good. Even a non resident, you're allowed two bucks.

Speaker 3:          00:17:30       And do they um, do they have bear up there? Is it black pair? You have to think about the bears. You'll see some bear droppings or bear scat or bear shit here and there. But those bears out there, so tuned in on the salmon runs that they really don't spend a lot of time. Um, I think some move, but they really don't spend a lot of time feeding in those areas because they're down 2000 feet. Timberline is like 1800, 2000 feet. They're down 2000 feet lower in the river, miles feed, non salmon. And we, and we'd like to have, you know, that image of the bear grabbing a salmon out and he's all silver and shiny and healthy and floppy, but long after the runs are kind of done, they're down. They're just, they're down. They're just feeding and rotten fish laying around. I've watched, I've watched wolves, they're eating dead saying I watch five wools one time eating dead salmon that were the consistency of pudding.

Speaker 3:          00:18:24       Whoa. Just mopping it up. They must have unbelievable stomach fat, man. You can't even imagine. So, um, there's not a lot of bears up there. You know, there's a lot of, you see some barriers around, but I think that so many of the bears are focused on that stuff. One thing you find some people say, and in those islands in southeast Alaska, dude, they're like, they tend to be either a black bear island or a grizzly island and it just, and it changes. So you'd be on one island and it's black bears, another island, islands, grizzlies. And it's sort of this weird phenomenon that they don't readily mix. You get an interior areas on the mainland where you have grizzlies and black bears coexist. Oftentimes the grizzlies will dominate the salmon streams and you'll have more black bears up high. So you could be standing on a mountain a couple thousand feet above sea level, and it's just black bears everywhere on top of the mountain feed on blueberries.

Speaker 3:          00:19:16       And you're looking down at Primo salmon streams, but just big brown bears being grizzlies down there and they kind of hoard the spot and the blackberries don't get in there. They just can't. They, they, you know, they're kind of enemies. Yeah, they'll eat them too. Right. They'll eat grizzlies. Yeah. The, uh, the place that I was up in Alberta, we went bear hunting. They take a carcasses after they cut the back straps off in the Hams, they'll take like the body cavity and they, they leave it in certain areas where they know grizzlies are to keep the grizzlies coming over there. Right? Yeah. Cause they don't want the grizzlies coming to the, um, the other, uh, Bates, the baits they have out for the black pair of no one can do, they have to abandon that bill because it's just too sketchy. They have some photos from track camera trap photos, these fucking enormous grizzlies wandering standing up on black bears.

Speaker 3:          00:20:03       Yeah. I got a buddy who saw one time, he witnessed a grizzly kill, a black bear disemboweled it and eat its liver. Whoa. Yeah. And there's a, there's a very well regarded hunting guide in Alaska, is written some good hunting books about Alaska named Tony Ross. And I was reading his book on Hunting Kodiak or he's got, he's got a book on Hunting Brown bears and grizzlies in Alaska and live his experiences around Kodiak and the Alaska peninsula. And he was saying he's never seen. And just the backup for a minute on Kodiak a sig, like if you map out a bear's diet, okay. A bear bore bear male, Brown bear Grizzly, you know brown bear on Kodiak. If you met Bob as annual die, what he's tuned into in the spring are brown bear cubs. Yeah, he's like males, right? He's like wakes up and he's hunting brown bear cubs and as a sick fuck significant part of his diet.

Speaker 3:          00:20:56       But what Tony Ross has said and all of his years of guiding, he's never seen where when you kill a big mature Bor brown bear, he's never seen where another brown bear will come and scavenge that carcass. Wow. They'll skate. They even with the things skinned out and butchered. Right. They recognize through smell or whatever. They will not mess with that thing. That's what he says. Black and his guys seen. Oh yeah. And this guy has seen a lot, but he was saying nothing will touch those big boars. The body on him too. Scared of. I just, I don't know, even with some the bottom, the smell or something and they just know that they don't want anything to do with it.

Speaker 1:          00:21:32       Wow. When we were in a Alberta, one of the guys shot a bear late at night and they didn't want to retrieve it because there was too many bears in the area. It was just getting sketchy. They shot the bear like right at the moment where it's getting dark out and the bear ran off and they just said, we'll come back in the morning. So they came back in the morning and a big bore was eating the other black bear. Oh really? So they had, they were taking selfies like smiling while there, there was a bear behind them eating a bear

Speaker 3:          00:22:00       carcass. They have new buddy of where he got one and trail he shot one was Bo and track that the morning and had it was just gone, had been consumed.

Speaker 1:          00:22:09       So crazy. Yeah. Yeah. That's, that's the wild man. When we were up there, one of the bears, one of the Boers had a attacked, a sow killed. It's cub and left half the cubs body and then the south came back and finished it off. She ate her own basically. Yeah. She ate her own baby in front of them while they were in the, in the stand.

Speaker 3:          00:22:28       I've heard competing theories about that, that on one hand the board just is doing it because he wants to eat, but there seems to be this upside where there's an additional upside besides chloric intake. Did a boar will kill a south cubs and she'll come back into estrus? Yeah, so when a sound like a, a sound's to, she'll have her, her cubs in the den in February and March. Okay. There's little hairless. It's Joanie, you know, she had them prior to seize the hairless little things and she'll take care of them. She'll emerge from her dad, but he's a little fur balls. She'll stay with them all summer long. She'll den with them again. She'll come out again and usually at some point that summer she might get rid of him and so she's going to be off like she won't cycle again potentially for two years. So if a bar has in his area, he hangs out, he's got a half dozen females. Apparently it's worth the risk to him that he might be, I'm talking in a, in a genetic sense, it's worth the risk to him that he might be killing his own offspring, which probably has no idea whether it is or not, kill his own offstring offspring in order to,

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       to have that female go back into estrus and then breed her. Wow. Nature, whatever kind of calculation. He's probably not, I mean, obviously he's not making that calculation. He's probably just going like, I'm hungry, but an added benefit of it is apparently he get, he might double back around and you know, and get her again and make love to the woman who's children he consumed. Well, dolphins actually have a strategy against that because one of the things that a lot of people are not aware we think of dolphins is being really sweet and kind and they're nice to people. But dolphins, they eat their own babies. No, I didn't know that. Well, they don't eat their own babies, but they dolphin babies. And what a male dolphin finds a female that he has never had sex with and she has babies. They'll oftentimes kill the babies and they'll kill the babies to force a woman to back to breeding again because she'll go on a seven year cycle.

Speaker 1:          00:24:37       So when a female dolphin has a baby, she will not breed again for seven years. While that baby is being raised and and growing legs, they put a huge investment. The strategy for female dolphins is they are sluts and they fuck as many dolphins as they can so that when the mail comes around and he sees her with the babies, like that might be my fucking kid. All right, I'm not going to kill that kid because that's what keeps them from killing the, the, the feed those babies. It's really why, because they're thinking, I mean, they're really intelligent animals. They have a cerebral cortex. It's 40% larger than a human beings. And in a matter of fact, anybody who's listening to this checkout radio lab radio lab has an amazing podcast. The one that's on this week, it's called hello, and it's all about John Lilly. And John Lily's work with interspecies communication with, you know who John Lilly was?

Speaker 1:          00:25:26       He was a no, no, I don't know that name. Maniac crazy man. And uh, these other scientists that worked with him actually wound up taking his research and bringing it to some new place because Lilly, uh, he was also the inventor of the isolation tank. He created a sensory deprivation tank because he was, he was a pioneer. You're a fan of huge fan Lilly. Uh, we would take acid and set up a tank next to the dolphins and he would take acid going into the isolation tank and try to communicate with the dolphins. So while the dolphins were like make all these weird noises, he would like try to decipher those while he was on acid in his tank. And he eventually went off the deep end with like really getting like heavily, heavily into ketamine and all these weird tranquilizers and drugs and became actually addicted to ketamine.

Speaker 1:          00:26:16       And that's when he lost all his funding. Nobody wanted to have anything to do with it when it came to this dolphin research anymore cause they knew that he was doing that. And one of the women that he had hired to um, live with a dolphin, they had like an apartment set up. Oh, where it was underwater. It was essentially to her it was like waist high and water. And she had a dolphin that she lived with for like six months in this and she wound up like jerking the dolphin off because the dolphin would like humper leg all the time. It'd be really distracting. Cause was a young dolphin. So she's like, let me just take care of that for you. And she would just jerk this dolphin off and then you know, to her it was like, look, he's got an issue and it's getting in the way of work, so I'll just take care of that.

Speaker 1:          00:26:53       But everybody else was like, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, whoa. You're doing scientific research by jerking off dolphins. Like yeah, I could see that. Yeah. She might need a cop minutes to explain herself. But the, the podcasts or sort of focuses on dolphin communication and they're there, the difficulty that they have. Like they know that the dolphins want to communicate with them, but they have that blow hole and that's how they make their noise. So it's really hard for them to make noises that mimic human noises cause they don't really have the ability to make ms and teas and all these dishes

Speaker 3:          00:27:28       completely different.

Speaker 1:          00:27:31       So in the, in the podcasts you hear her talking to the Dolphin and the dolphin trying to imitate what she saying. It's crazy. Right? It's amazing.

Speaker 3:          00:27:41       You get into it. Like when you get into animal communication, so much of it becomes

Speaker 3:          00:27:47       semantical or an argument of semantics where he'd say like, we're, we're the only thing with language. And people be like, well, you know, actually x, Y and Z has something. Okay, well I mean we're the only thing with complex language, any big, well, you know, some animals are actually able to convey, you know, fairly complex things like that. There's, you know, a, a Predator above us and like, well what I mean is they don't have syntax. Right. You know, and you kind of like wine up right now. It's like the verdict's still out man. There's some like animals do convey some complicated stuff and bace brothers or cologists you know like phd scientists and they kind of hate the conversation, you know, because they really resist, not resistant to, but they have a hard time with trying to use our terminology and use our language to describe what animals are up to. Right. You know, like to say for, for you to say that the dolphin eats the bay or doesn't want to eat the baby because it might be his baby. Someone might argue that that animal probably has no comprehension of that or even that they are not able to equate sex with reproduction. Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:28:59       They're so intelligent though. I don't know how they wouldn't be able to equate. I don't, I don't either. I don't think this all the time because I really should have said killed. They killed him. I don't, I don't think they eat them. They might say they really ran, but they killed him. They bite him.

Speaker 3:          00:29:12       You know, I struggled this stuff all the time because, you know, as a hunter I'm always weighing out like, well what is it like, what are the things that we're after and what are their capabilities? You know, I don't want to fall into some trap or I just act like, oh that just like corn with legs, you know. So I do, I am curious all the time about the capabilities of animals and I tend to be open to the idea that there's, there's like different sets of experiences that different animals have. You know, there's some have more, perhaps more of an awareness than others. Yeah. You know, there's like a, there's a hierarchy if you will. And I think that the consensus is that dolphins are pretty high on that hierarchy.

Speaker 1:          00:29:56       Yeah. Dolphins and Orcas, of course, orchids are very high up on that. They, and they eat dolphins. That's what's really fucked up.

Speaker 3:          00:30:02       You know, I've been going through some of my kid, man. He um, we just moved to the Pacific northwest and so I keep talking to them. I kid about, everything's got a killer whale on it, you know, like, like stores, grocery stores, whatever. It just like a common motif. And I'm like, I would tell him that's a killer whale. It's a killer whale. And I know the lot of people like to call them or it goes, you know, in is some Greek word I think just means Sateesh and just means whale. It's a pretty generic term. And some people say that killer whale killer whales used to be called whale killers and whale killer became killer whale. So I'm always telling my kid, all that's killer whale. And one day my kid comes home and he just madder than hell because he learned that it's not a killer whale.

Speaker 3:          00:30:42       It's ORC. You know? And I'm like, listen man, I know what I like. I know what the person who told you that is trying to tell you. And I already know that, but I told you killer whale, not because I wasn't aware because I was trying to circumvent, you know, I was trying to do, to come back around against what you would inevitably learn about it's PC name. Uh, I say, you know, you were planning in advance. It wasn't that I didn't know. I was just trying to fill you up with, just to open you to the idea that, that there's the animals get new names all the time and it's just a PC. It's like a, it's like a, um, what do you call it? Like a marketing term? Yeah. Cause as a marketing term scholar mean it's not a whale. It's a tooth whale is it? But a dolphins. A tooth. We'll too, because I thought, pardon me? I thought you were saying that someone wasn't a mammal or something. Oh No, it's, it's a, it's a cousin of a dolphin. Right? You know, I don't know, like taxonomically where's it at? I'd be, I'd be curious. I'm pretty sure it's a no.

Speaker 1:          00:31:42       Yeah, because I'm pretty sure there's a word crazy video of one keel. They're killing a whale while it's alive. These killer whales are behind. That's how most killing happens. Yeah. But I mean, it's, it's, I should say they're eating it while it's alive. Oh. Fighting chunks of its face off. And it's just so hard to watch because we think of these whales as being these beautiful creatures. And we think of why we have this weird idea of killer whales as being like these really noble creatures. You know? Cause I always think of killer whales as being like the friend of man. And that's why when one does freak out at seaworld, it makes seaworld looks so horrible because in the wild there's almost no evidence whatsoever that whales have ever killed anybody. But he's probably, after awhile I was like, what am I supposed to kill them?

Speaker 1:          00:32:23       Yeah, yeah. Exact killer. Exactly. Whale. And the instincts that they have, you know, I was, the way, I always equated, one of the things I have a problem with zoos in general is that they don't allow animals to do their natural thing. I really think that would zoos should be, is get all motherfuckers together. You should have a giant piece of land of you gonna fence it in, let them in there and let them run wild. And if people really want to see animals, what they should see is Jaguars killing monkeys. And the whole goal, the whole gamut and it sounds fucked up. But that's really what the wild is. Cause what we're doing by taking these animals and putting them in these weird cages is we're creating these closed in ecosystems where these animals never have to compete there. Food is given to them and we're ruining their genetics.

Speaker 1:          00:33:07       I mean those animals that are in zoos, they're completely incapable of ever being reintroduced into the wild unless you take them. And it would have to be some really exhausting effort to try to reintroduce them to the idea of hunting their own food or cat a gathering their own food. But those fucking dummies that you have in the zoo, you've created these welfare monkeys, these monkeys that just, I shouldn't say welfare should say like their pets. They're like dogs. It's like expecting your dog to figure out how to go hunting when he's just sitting there wagging his tail, waiting for you to open up a can of alto. They don't know any better,

Speaker 3:          00:33:41       but what zoos using their defense and you know some people we've kind of gotten away from, a lot of people have gotten away from aesthetically, so like the bear in the cage kind of display, but what zoos are eyes able to use in their defense is that with cases like the panda, Florida Panther, oh did they have a genetic reserve? Right. So maybe they're not, maybe they're not insuring behavior. They're not like protecting behavior, but they're at least protecting like the genetic reserve. Yeah. Shit hit the fan for some species you have that. And there's many, many examples of things that you know of wild populations that had been supplemented through the zoo stuff. But I know what you're saying. Like I don't like I, when I take my kid to a zoo, I remember we were sitting there looking at this like, I mean just the pathetic example of a, of a grizzly bear. I remember just kind of wanting to look at my son and be like, listen dude, you're getting the wrong idea. These things are bad ass normally, you know, it's just kind of sad.

Speaker 1:          00:34:44       Have you seen that show, the hunt that I told you about?

Speaker 3:          00:34:47       No. No, I didn't see it, but I remember you talking about it pretty interesting. I don't think I write about it after you showed it after you told me about it, because the guy from Metallica was narrating it and then he got, he, their band got punished and weren't allowed to

Speaker 1:          00:34:59       play at a music festival. They were trying to ban them. I don't take it. What the fuck is this? Because he narrated a show. James Hetfield. Yeah, he's a good narrator. It's interesting. And he's a hunter. He hunts a lot and uh, there's a photo of him with his fucking giant pair. Holy Shit. I mean, it's a perspective shot, you know, they always put the bear. Yeah, we getting way back. But, but this fucking bear is huge. I mean, it's like a nine foot bear. It's enormous. Is it just the shoulders on this fucking thing and the head on this thing, it's just this and he's standing in front of people like, Oh my God, disgusting. Evil. But they don't understand is if you truly love bears, you got to kill that bear because if you don't kill

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       that bear that bear, those big giant bears are responsible for decimating the population of cubs. That's what they do. And if you don't trim the big ones, if you don't kill some of the big ones, there's a photo of him with the bear. I mean data is a fucking big, where was that? Was that Cody? Kodiak? Kodiak, yeah. He shot went up there while he was doing that show. Apparently. I mean they are enormous and you might see like someone might see that you killed a big male bear and, and be upset by it, but you're really not impacting the bear population. You know, you're impacting that individual bear but you're not having any kind of real longterm deleterious effect on the bears of the island, which are very, you know, it's a very stable, well-regulated population of bears out there. I put it in for that tag.

Speaker 3:          00:36:29       I think as a non guided nonresident. So like if you're wanting to go with the guide, you can go to Kodiak and haunt, you know, you just go book a trip and go. So you just have to pay them and they have a certain amount of tax. They it's, I don't know what it is, you might pay 25 30 grand for the hunt. It's interesting watching it but non guided non resident that's always put in for it. There's a very limited number of tags for non guided nonresident, which mean that I would have to go in lieu of a guide. I get her like, because my brother is a resident of Alaska, I don't need to use a guide when hunting animals that you normally need the guide to hunt. So I can go with him and hunt there. And so every other year they do a thing where you can apply for the spring hunt.

Speaker 3:          00:37:09       I always put in for that hunt and then when you're talking about that show, I was bummed because I was like, now the odds of drawing that tag are probably gonna for a long time. Go Way, way, way down because it's probably gonna be a ton of dudes putting in for the permit now. Yeah, it could be wrong. Probably like it's going to increase interest and now I'm like trying to think of a new place to start putting in. I've never killed a grizzly bear. I want to, I really wanted to one time. Well, you also have a weird thing where you want a grizzly bear to scratch your chest and leave scars.

Speaker 3:          00:37:41       Why would you say it meant a lot more than me when I was single? That just seems like one of the worst requests. However, like a fucking giant bay. I mean, what did, what is a full grown grizzly way? What's the way? I mean, there's a magical number that gets thrown around a lot. It's like when people were on, when people want to say that a bear was huge, they say it was a thousand pounds. Right? But those I guess are like, if you put a lot of thousand pound bears on a scale there, 800 pounds. Okay, there's 750 pounds, a hundred pounds. You know, again at Tony, Russ got it that wrote those books I was talking about has a, he's at an immense amount of experience and he kind of has a passage in there where he talks about like the thousand pound bear and there just aren't a lot of them out there is as much as you read people getting like 10 foot thousand pound bears, you, you, you and I laughed about this before because everyone that sees a mountain lion in the wild

Speaker 4:          00:38:36       always says, um, big fucking bore, you know, 200 pound boar. And I remember like, I laugh because you saw a lion and you said it look like a small one. I was like, you're the first guy I've ever met the sauce, small y. I see two of them. They were both around the same weight. The first one I saw was like a dog size. It's like 60, 70 pounds. And the second one, it was a much quicker view of them. But again, I thought it was a coyote until I saw its tail. And then I noticed it had this big bouncy tale. It was in Santa Barbara. I was in Monosito driving through a residential neighborhood and were like, my wife said it was so afraid. She goes, coyote and I go, Oh Shit, look at its tail. And we're like, that's a mountain lion. It was like, so it was like in that time we saw it in the headlights, couldn't have been more than 70 pounds.

Speaker 4:          00:39:18       You're discerning individual did not have seen a 200 pound towns, so there's the thousand pound bear, but that that bear, we're just looking at it as it is a huge variable. I don't know what he, well, did you see that video that's been going around lately of a bear that was walking around on two legs and people were saying, is this big foot? Is this what people are seeing? Because it's absolutely a black bear and this bear just for whatever reason that's a size to get around. He walked like a long distance on two legs. It gets a crazy video. Pull that video up Jamie, because it's the one in the neighborhood, right? Yeah. Yeah. It's like walking in this like suburban neighborhood and his fucking bear. He's on two legs, like a dude in a bear outfit like Yogi. Really? Yeah, and I mean he walks 30 40 yards like this. So if you were in the woods and you saw this bear doing that, he'd be like, I saw a fucking Sasquatch. I know what I saw. Especially if it was like dusk. You know, look at this bear. Look at him. You got to be kidding me. No, check them out man. Pull it. Pull it from the beginning so we could see the whole thing.

Speaker 4:          00:40:17       ABC News. Look at this. Oh yeah man. I mean if you didn't know any better, especially if it's thick woods and you saw that thing, you would fucking swear that that's the, the shots you're looking at, right there are often about, as long as you see a bear. Yeah, look at him. Look at that. Look at that. That is fucking crazy. That's pretty wild that you like to get around like that. You would assume that that is a monkey. That's an ape. That's a fucking bear. No. Does he have a normal gait when he does get down on all fours? He screwed up some who's running? Oh, he was, you saw him run on all four paws or injured. Oh, his paws injured. Or you might've got trap. No, no, no, not both. Pause. Just like, right Paul. It looks like he's right. Pause one states in New Jersey.

Speaker 4:          00:41:07       Yeah. I mean if he got caught in a trap is because someone illegally set, mm. I don't think that's the car. I mean you can't trap bears in New Jersey, but just the fact that a bear has that ability, I can trap it all in New Jersey. I don't know if there's some fur trapping there, but I don't know to what extent, but there's no bear trapping there. It isn't impossible that he got caught in another animal's trap and that's how he's still alive because he only ever law. There's no trap that would be used for bearing animals

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       now that would cripple that thing to the point where he would do that. If he got caught and a foothold trap or leg old trap, he would pop his foot out of there. Really? I mean, I can't, like, I can't rule out everything. If that's what happened to that bear. And I have no reason to think that it is. Um, if that, if like if someone came down and said, absolutely that's what happened to that bear, I'd be like, then someone was doing like an illegal trapping active because that's not something that would happen. Is it much more likely she, cause we were looking at a resident like clap do it on something, but I could put my ice to do this when I used to trap, I used to do this all time is you know, I can snap my hand in most traps really now cause the tramp has more of a function of, I mean this is going to get all, you're going to probably hear from all kinds of your listeners, but it has a holding function.

Speaker 3:          00:42:21       So it starves to death. No, not, not if you're, no, because you have to check your traps. Oh, so you go there and it's still alive. Then you have to kill it. Yeah. So when I suffered trip, I would check my traps every 24 hours, usually in the morning, you know. But anyways, what the trap large serves to do is hold something and the way when you rig them, if you do things right, okay, you ring them with a lot of swivels and things and so what you're trying to do is really limit any kind of damage to the animal. And this isn't altruistic. The reason you want to limit damage to the animal is the animals less likely to fight the trap. Okay. If you have a trap that causes, that causes nerve damage, bone damage, numbing, okay. It's all the more chances that that thing is going to be working harder to get away and to thinking is that in the ideal case, you're just trying to hold it.

Speaker 3:          00:43:17       We're the foothold trap. So in what you're thinking does everybody, they, yeah, people want to say chew, but what they will do, and I've, you know, I have, I've seen it happen, particularly the Muskrat's which have very, very thin bones. There's one only has one. Paul wonder what happened to him? Where's that? I have no idea. I just typed in bear trap. That's hog service. What do you think happened there? Well that's, that's too high on his leg to be a trap. Yeah. So you, maybe that's a shot, a gunshot or something like that. Then he could have gotten shot. He could've got shot. He could've got hit by a car. He could've got gotten. I mean, you know, I mean things we meet such weird ends and injuries. I've seen bears it, I'm fairly convinced on Prince of Wales Island, I've seen bears that I'm fairly convinced had been shot just because of the sort of like where on the shoulder it happened, you know?

Speaker 3:          00:44:07       Right. Like it looked like someone look like, I just be like, I could picture how that would happen. I can't say that that didn't happen there, but I wouldn't, that's not a trap thing. What I asked you with muskrats anyways, most guys have very, very, very thin bones and you'll see where you'd get must grass. It would, in trapper parlance, they'll say it would ring out. So we'll just twist and get away, you know. Oh, okay. So it just keeps spinning. And so people say like a chew out, but it's weird because people who people defending trapping, we'll like to clarify this. Not actually chew off. It's a ring on, but they're still cutting their own arm off. Yeah, I spinning around until the tissue. I never saw it. I saw it on, um, Muskrat's I never saw it on larger animals. I know, I'm not saying that it doesn't happen, but again, like, like everything, there's a, there's a sort of, there's good practices. Okay. I don't travel anymore so I'm not, I don't have like, uh, when I, when I tell you what I'm telling you, I'm just telling you this from being a guy who likes to be clear about factual matters. I'm not, I don't have like a real dog in the race on this, so to speak right now. But when, if you follow good practices on trapping, okay.

Speaker 3:          00:45:24       You, it's in your best interest to not have these sorts of things happen that you would set in away that you don't have incidental catches for bycatch. Right. You check your traps on a very tight schedule. You know, you read them in such a way that you don't cause damage, that if you did get something else into your trap, you would be able to release that thing unharmed. But there are people who, for lack of caring and there are people who just for lack of technical expertise, screw these things up. You know, and oftentimes you could get violations like what would be like a trapping based violation from someone who wouldn't self identify as a fur trapper but who just got mad about some bear or whatever getting into his dumpster and then he takes matters into his own hands completely outside of the law and decides to like fix that bear and an expert lease at a trap for it.

Speaker 3:          00:46:14       You know, delve, there are bear traps right though. Chaps, you seen those movies at catch the bad guy in his leg and he's screaming, ah, Yup. Those are real. Those are, I mean there, there used to be a lot of black bear trapping, you know, people use trap blackberries all the time. There used to be some grizzly trapping at a time. People would trap them to sell for, they trap them to get them for, you know, scientific purposes. They, they'd trap them to just catch them for pets they trap and to mitigate livestock risk. You know, there's a lot of traveling going on right now. Bear trapping. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:46:50       [inaudible] isn't a thing that goes out. There's not like there's a bear trap went there. Yeah. Yeah. And what's funny now is that there used to be a lot of bear traps, antique bear chaps on the market, but people still manufacturer. What would, what would be a bear trap in order to sell it as a like as a piece of memory? Like a false memorabilia. Oh, like a Flint lock gun. Exactly. So there's a lot of guys that make re like reproductions of old bear traps. There's no like, no one's like intending that they're going to go set it for a bear. But people want to have like a lodge. You know, you've got like your cabin and you wanna have a big bear trap hanging up in it, right? So there's a lot of bear traps and you'll see where a doodle think he has something, you know

Speaker 4:          00:47:29       when he's trying to sell it for 1000 bucks and you look at and be like, you could go buy those all day long for $150. It just like, it's not old. There's a comedy club in town called the Improv and the front of the Comedy Club at one time they've abandoned it, but it was a barbecue place and the barbecue place, they tried to make it like with old tools and the wall like an old saw, like you know those wooden handle on each side and you could look at it and you're like, I know that shit. It's two years old. Like I'm looking at, it's all rusty and everything, but I know this is not a fucking antique. They had a one of those sickles that you know, like the, the death dealer that uh, w, what do they call it? The depth grim reaper. Grim reaper is always supposed to have that was on the wall to it.

Speaker 4:          00:48:11       Trying to make it like some farm. Oh yeah. Old timey. Old timey wood walls, like a stain, you know, like uh, like they made it look like it's old and weathered, you know the wood, which summit mean? This is actually from 100 year old farm house. The wood that we have here. This is reclaimed oak. This is nice. Yeah. I specifically went out of the way to get old would cause I felt like it be kind of cool, you know, because it's probably some weird energy in some old farm would. And this is like real old thick wood. Oh yeah. No, I like it. I have the, me and my old man cut down. He's dead now. But when I was in high school, he was building a pole barn and we cut down oak on this piece of property we owned across the road from our house.

Speaker 4:          00:48:57       It's the little corner lot. And we cut down to, oh he built the barn and I took that. Oh, the logs. And I took them down and put them on a flatbed trailer and had a milled in lumber. Oh Wow. And it took all that lumber and years later he's been dead since. I think 2002 2003 I still haven't finished this, but then I laminated all those pieces together and to like what looks like chunks of Bowling Lane. Ah, I'm still trying to make a damn desk out of these things. Oh Wow. It's like, and I'm actively engaged right now. I'm trying to move one of these slabs from miles city out to Washington now so I can continue my now 12 year long project or trying to turn me in the old man's tree. So anyways, I'm, I'm a sentimentalist when it comes to wood, just like yourself.

Speaker 4:          00:49:38       Oh, that's cool. So you're going to make it like writing desk, like where you do your writing? I think so. I think I'm gonna make a ramp around us. Gal. That's a great idea. Yeah. But all the pieces I have together on his biggest, his desk or sitting at, but it's still a nice big chunk. I have a desk that I bought in 1993 it's a writing desk and it's got two levels, like one level. It's a very, it's old, it's oak, you know, but it's like there was a place called the writer's store and it was a store in Hollywood that was just all writing stuff needs to have like script programs for old school Max. Like you know the oldest computing muses, 1994 that I got this fucking thing and I've written everything I've ever written on this one desk still. No. Yeah, I won't. I will ever get rid of it. My wife's like, let's get rid of this piece of shit. I'm like, get the fuck Outta here. This does desk going nowhere. It's solid as a rock. It's all oak, but it's just, there's stains on it. She said it's disgusting. Got like coffee. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       yeah, yeah, yeah. This shit's perfect. Like as long as it's in my office, you fucking leave it. He has got the Patina of your a sweat and labor. Everything good I've ever written is all from that desk. This is one desk I've had and I'm never getting rid of it. I've just got this one oak desk that I've had from the beginning of my time here in La and I'll never get rid of that. Fuck. So when you say that you've written, do you sit down and write? Yes. Stand up. Well, I sit down and write, this is what I do. Most of the time I write, like I used to keep an active blog on my website, but um, when I started writing a book, I got a book deal a few years back and I started writing a book. I stopped writing the blog and then when, uh, the publishers were just fucking trying to, they were essentially trying to get me to write it, like, stand up.

Speaker 1:          00:51:14       I remember you talking about, yeah. So I gave them their money back. What'd you fell like? Doesn't work for a book. Well, I don't like it. Like I've read, I've read like George Carlin's book, which is essentially just his stand up in, in book form. And Jerry Seinfeld did a similar thing. I don't like that. I, if I'm gonna, if I want George Carlin's writing like that, I want to see it. I want to see George Carlin do is to, I don't want to read it. And then there's some benefit I guess and breeding it. There's some, it's good, it's better than nothing, but it's not as good as when I, when I write, I'm writing stuff because I know people are going to read it, you know? So the descriptive, a very different, the way it's spaced out is very different. The way I set things up is different.

Speaker 1:          00:51:52       And so, um, what I do now is I write as if I was going to write a book or a blog entry and then I go over it and then I extract ideas that come out of that because I feel like I do both. Like I'll write down specifically, I'll try to write as a joke, like thinking I'm standing on stage and you know, set up punchline or beginning premise and then add in the jokes. But more often I just write like I'll write about something. And then along the way, usually I'm baked. So it's, I get silly, like as I'm writing, like these new ideas will come in and I'll just deal with characters and stuff. No, no, no. Just writing as you were told that sometimes you write as you talking. Yeah, I right. Not even as me talking, I just write like I'll write like, uh, like, uh, pick a subject like, um, whatever amphetamines, pissed speed, you know, Adderall and I'll start writing about Adderall.

Speaker 1:          00:52:51       And then along the way, you know, I'll have like a really funny thing will come up in the writing or like, like I'm laughing as I'm writing it because it just came out of nowhere. Did you feel like you're a really good writer, Matt, by the way? I really loved mediator, so really good book. Oh, thanks man. It's a, and it was, uh, I mean, I knew you're a smart dude and you're, you're obviously very articulate, but the writing was very, it's very descriptive. It's very interesting. It's very fun to follow. And when you, um, when you write stuff like that, don't you feel like sometimes,

Speaker 4:          00:53:26       like as you're writing, like it's almost like it's not even you that's writing like these ideas just sorta like pop into your head, like out of nowhere and then you're putting them down?

Speaker 3:          00:53:36       No. Um, um, for me, I'm so aware of the process that there's no surprising thing to me. One of my mentors and what, like what I regard as one of the best American nonfiction writers out there alive now as a, as a writer named Ian Frazier. And what's his work? He's got several books. One of the books I hold, it was just like, you're one of the, in my opinion, one of the finest books ever written as his book. Great Plains, great plains, which is about the great plains. Um, but he's, he's a stylist, you know, he's also a, he was a humor writer for the New Yorker for a long time. It was, I had great fortune to, you know, he, he know if he would use his term, I think he'd like mentored me in somewhere. I read his stuff and had the opportunity to hang out with him a handful of times.

Speaker 3:          00:54:27       And then he was saying that when he was growing up and you wanted to be a writer, he pictured the writers would be that you're sitting at a desk kind of chuckling to yourself as you, you know, have all these fantastic ideas. But when I write, I get so few words written every day and every sentence that I write takes, I have to write it and rewrite it and rewrite it so many times that there's never a thing where I feel like, um, there's never a thing where I feel like, holy smokes, I nailed it because it's, it's, so, I almost look at it like if you're building a house, you know, maybe when you get all done with the house, you can stand outside and be like, wow, there it is. I did it right. But there's never, there's never a shocking moment because every nail and every board, you know, there's never a chance for where something jumps ahead radically, really quickly in a way they can start with you.

Speaker 3:          00:55:22       Now, the other night I wrote my brother's getting married this weekend. My older brother and I sat down to to make some notes about, um, I'm gonna, you know, my best man speech right after I wrote my best man's speech. It's funny because this just happened to me last night after I did my best man's speech. I felt like, why can't I feel like I had it where I got, I was like talking about some funny stuff in my head and kind of writing down notes and I thought of some way to actually like you're supposed to doing the best man speech is you're supposed to make it like hit right? Like hit the right note. It's funny and your dog and on them and then all of a sudden you turn it, you know, and it's sweet and nice. Okay. And I found that turn to make it sweet and nice and it's so, and it just struck me as being like perfect, you know? And I was like, why can't the regular writing? I do feel that way. That's interesting. Where I'm like, Huh. You know, and I kind of want to like pump my fist in the air.

Speaker 4:          00:56:17       Whether people that, you know, that our writers have those moments with those, those uh, those moments that I'm talking about where things just pop to you.

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       I feel like they do. I, I, you know, one of the things that I follow on Twitter is this thing I'm John Winokur and it's just, I don't know how he does it, but six or seven times a day he's got quotes from great writers about writing. How do you spell his name? J. O. H. N. W. I. N. O man. John Winokur. It's like writers on writing. And I learned more about writing and writers from reading this thing cause it's like really cool writers talking about the writing process. I'm sure he's probably hit one just within minutes. Oh, at advice to writers, advice to writers had you, uh, like here right now. Just it, it minutes ago. Um, or a couple of hours ago when I write, I don't think of the audience after the fact. I think, well I hope they like it. So that's like, oh, writer talking about writing. Right. And this Twitter feed hits these quotes all day long.

Speaker 3:          00:57:16       So I learned more about writers, even though I went to writing school and everything, I learned more about writers following that guy's Twitter account. And I do get that some writers are blown away and have fun writing. To me it's agonizing. I can't stand it. That's a weird thing about doing TV is I love having written, you know, when I write a book, I'm so, it's just like a deep, deep satisfaction. Okay. I love having done it when I die, if they will, if they chisel writer into my tombstone, you know, I, I'd be very happy. Right. But I hate the act of writing. Make a TV is so fun. Just in the moment. It's very fun. I love going out and doing it, you know? But when it's said and done, I don't get that, that feeling like I slayed the dragon. Like I would get from writing a book.

Speaker 3:          00:58:09       I know exactly what you're talking about. You know, you're, when you're doing a television show also, it's very different than most TV. And that you're out there doing something you enjoy anyway. Exactly. And there's a lot of people coming in on it. So writing is like me. I mean sure. You know you have it. I don't mean to in any way discount the role of an editor. And I don't know if you do something similar with your standup, you show other comedians and stuff, but you have like a role of an editor. So I don't want to act like, oh, it's just all out of your head. You know, my agent I work closely with, he influences things. I do my header, but, and yet it's kind of, it's your thing, right? TV's a whole bunch of people so you could go out and have a great thing and then you turn it in and the, and the editor nails it.

Speaker 3:          00:58:49       So I can't go like I made this amazing TV show because it's like there's the guy that produced it, the guys that shot the guys edited it, right. All that kind of stuff. And so you're a sense of ownership becomes a little bit different. You're like a stake holder and not like the dude that owns the thing. Yeah. There's so much going on. There's music, there's the way it's edited. Oh extremely. It really has a massive impact on how it comes off as a, as a piece. Yeah. I think like as a host, you know, as a host and as a person who has like a, a lot of sway in the kinds of things we go do, I still feel like I'm, you know, I'm kicking in 10 or 20% and 80 90% is, you know, a handful of other people who are throwing in on it.

Speaker 3:          00:59:33       Nobody works harder than people who work on your show. Like those kinds of dudes like Doty and Mo and all those guys who have to fucking sleep in tents and in the back of that fucking van where the lamas pissed and I really kind of love it. I love those guys was fine. We just had this guy, we wound up liking him. We had a camera guy to come out with us for the first time and then he was just getting beat up. I mean, it'd be he admitted it, you know, and it kind of became the joke where he's saying the Dougherty, he's like, man, you guys gotta do a better job of explaining what this is. And Dan's like, I feel like I said, it's like rigorous hiking, you know? And he's like, yeah, but like that's not this. I thought like walking on a trail or something, you know, it's like, but there's no language to explain it.

Speaker 3:          01:00:24       I don't know why those guys, well I do know why I think one could look and be like, I don't understand why those guys would subject themselves to that right level of treatment. Because I've had the opportunity to work very briefly in what would be like network television, mainstream television. And I'm telling you what, that's not typical. What you do, what those guys do and the hours they do it is not typical. Not at all. No. I was shocked here like one time some guy was coming out with us and I knew it was gonna be trouble because he's come out of this. He's asking about what the hours are. And I'm like, I don't know. I think, you know, we usually we'll sleep at night 24 hours a day or that hours. It's like, what do you mean when you're sleeping on the ground in Montana and it's zero degrees outside and you're fucking huddled up in your tent, you're kind of working, still owe it because you would never be there unless they were paying you to be there. Like even though you're off, we'd still, you're subjecting yourself to sleeping on the ground in Montana in a tent and you're freezing your dick off. You know, like you have to like flex and squeeze under your sleeping bag to degenerate some warm before he can pass out. You're kind of working. Yeah. Like that. Like Dougherty Yanis Mo. I, they just,

Speaker 5:          01:01:39       okay.

Speaker 3:          01:01:40       Uh, they just, they like to be in some way tortured a little bit, I think. And they also just like to be working, you know, I don't, I don't think that they, but the other thing is, I don't think they really, they're at work, but I don't know how much they think about being at work.

Speaker 3:          01:01:55       I see what you're saying. I think they just think of it as like existing, whoa, Jimmy. I don't think they go like, oh no, I'm going to work. I think that they think of their lives more. Their lives don't seem to, I don't think they think of their lives and having like, it's like, no, I'm at work now. I'm at home now, I'm at work now I'm at home. I think like at home they're thinking about work stuff and uh, okay. Do you know what I mean? I feel like more there that they don't look at it like, you know, punching the old clock is my guess. They of, well it was funny

Speaker 4:          01:02:20       cause Mo and I had a conversation once about another show that he was working on and one of the guys that was on the other show and uh, he was taking great pride in describing what a coward this guy was. And it was, it was not even great pride, but he was enjoying it. He's like, he's yellow. He was talking about it, but it was like, here's a guy that's been working on your show for several seasons and he's fucking undergone some horrendous locations and climbing to the top of fucking mountains while carrying a 50 pound camera and the whole deal. I mean, these fucking cameras are no joke. And hiking, just carrying a gun, hiking is difficult because all it's sliding of the ground underneath you and you're constantly going up, up, up, and you're, you know, essentially like you're doing like little mini squats all day long and it's exhausting.

Speaker 4:          01:03:07       And these guys are doing it with one arm holding a fucking camera backwards, backwards. Like a little joke about ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire, you know, like she did everything Fred Astaire did backwards. Right, right, right. Yeah. Most too good though, man. Like, like we can't like most too good, you know, he's like, oh, he's off doing other stuff. You know, it was like a chain. It was like a treat to have him, but he's always trying to win, but he's just in such demand, you know what I mean? He's been, he's nominated for all these enemies all the time. Yeah. He won an Emmy nominated for an Emmy this year. Well, your show stands out at all. I mean there's, there's hunting shows and then there's your show. And the, the only show that I've seen recently that does that as well. Have you seen uncharted, the Jim Shockey show?

Speaker 4:          01:03:51       No, but I know a lot of, I know his stuff. I haven't seen that, but I know that, that, that show is a highly respected show. It's really good. Her daughter was telling me, he said, it's phenomenal. I watched it the other day for the first time and he was often Pakistan and it was really intense because one of the guys that goes with them all the time, his wife didn't want him go to Pakistan. I mean, she was like really scared and she was like, you know, it's so dangerous there. Please don't go. He's got a wife and kids. And so he stayed back and you know, Jim Shockey went by himself and they followed the guy who stayed back going on this trip, um, to hunt deer. And when he went on this trip at home in Texas to hunt deer, you know, he was talking about his dad and like he the real scene crying and it was, it was really intense.

Speaker 4:          01:04:39       It was very, very, very intense. But in a way that you, you know, like a lot of those shows are so fucking bad. Long before I got involved in TV and outdoor TV, it was like a thing you would always hear is friends of mine, guys I respected would kind of be sort of dismissing outdoor television as a genre. But the thing was I was like, but Shockey's legit or, or something or some such thing. I mean he's been around for so long. Yeah. But he's a, he's a highly respect to figure it was this annual thing called shot show and, and I see him, you can't miss them. I mean the guy is huge and you know, he's Kinda like the last great white hunter, you know, you know, cowboy hat all the time. I see him and I want you to, you know, I always think I'm going to go up and say something to them.

Speaker 4:          01:05:21       I never had it. Never had. Oh, I wouldn't, I would force myself to not ever want to meet that guy. And there's, there's an amazing thing. So, uh, I mean there's just some good clips and stuff he's done and he's, he's an articulate guy and goes to some cool places and he's, you know, is you can tell his heart's in the right place, man. I like, I think he has an honest, you know, he has an honest affection for, for wildlife and wild places. For sure. For sure. You also enjoys the roughing and aspect of it. Like he enjoys going to these ridiculous remote locations and hunting these very odd animals is very exotic animals. He did something when they flew into Russia and they, they took these fucking weird SUV things. He's off. I mean, I shouldn't even say SUV, these weird all terrain vehicles.

Speaker 4:          01:06:08       It looked like these military vehicles deep, deep, deep in the mountains like 12 hour drive and just see how he's been some wild places to get some fucking weird ram, you know, it was just, it was really intense. It was unexpected. I just was flipping through the channels and it came on and I'd seen his other show before. So this uncharted thing, I'd seen all these ads for it, but man, they were in Pakistan and they were, they had armed guards with him every way. They went guys with Ak 47 [inaudible] and it was like, it was pretty intense because it's a fucking dangerous, dangerous place. And he's out there wearing the traditional Muslim garb he wears like the, the clothes that those people where you don't want to stand out, you don't want to stand out as being a western guy. He's like the Green Berets man.

Speaker 4:          01:06:49       Yeah. So he's wearing their outfits as he's hunting. It's really intense and you know, they're off in the fucking middle of, I mean deep in the middle of nowhere hunting some ram. That's great. I'm glad. I'm glad you like that show cause it's good to hear, uh, you know something out there that caught your eye. It's really well done. It's really well done. But this is like that show your show and then like, you know, the rest of them are, there's some of them look like they're made with like a home movie camera and it's like a guy who has never even thought about making a show. Sometimes. That's true man. There's a guy, there's a guy I was talking to who makes the hunch show and one day we're talking and I was shocked to hear that he's a, he's a registered nurse as a full time job at a hospital.

Speaker 4:          01:07:29       Whoa. And He, you know, he makes a hunting show. He just burns it up man. And he's like, wow, he's just something he wants to do and he's just get double times. Just finds a way to make it happen. It's fucking hard. Some of them too, it's like there's some of them that are the same show always, which is so bizarre. Yeah. We, that's the thing, we have a conversation about his is, um, I wanted to go back and in film next spring. Um, I have, uh, a black bear permit for this regulatory year, which extends in the next spring for Prince of Wales. I wanted to go back and, and Doherty was saying it's like anything that, you know, we did a show out there, interrupt the mountain story. We did a show out on Prince Wales last spring and went and found a lot of bears and um, I, in the end I

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       could have shot a bear. I didn't because I just have this strange feeling and sometimes not strange sometimes doesn't want to watch bears rather than shoot at them. So we did a show about that and

Speaker 5:          01:08:28       okay.

Speaker 2:          01:08:28       I wanted to go back this spring and dirty was like, I just feel like anything we could have done out there, we've done, you know, and then one and I'm like, yeah, that's right. We probably shouldn't go and do a show an episode in the same place doing the same thing but then are having like Bahamas cause some shows. All it is, they don't do anything but hunt there like some lease they have for whitetail deer every single time. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:08:52       Show is looking at camera photos from camera traps and them, you know, talking about the different stands that they have set up and then them up in the stand with a bow and arrow waiting for a fucking deer to come by. I mean, that is every goddamn show. It's always whitetail. It's always in a tree stand. It's always in the same sort of farmland on the edges of these cornfields. And it's the same show every God damn week. And I guess people just like watching people hunt deer. Do you enjoy it? I watch, I watch him, you know, every now and then I like, you know, thinking like, Ooh, I wish I saw that deer and I was that close. I'll shoot the shit out of that.

Speaker 2:          01:09:25       Yeah. Like you'd learn a bunch of stuff eventually watching it. Yeah, he definitely

Speaker 1:          01:09:30       learn stuff. You learn stuff about wind and placement and the trails they walk and their behavior, like how they, you know, how they can kind of anticipate where they're coming through and how to, how to pay attention to their trails. And one of them, uh, well it was interesting. Uh, it was, uh, how to recognize the difference between the doe trails and the buck trails. So the doe trails, we're going straight across this like this a riverbed area where there's a lot of mud and you could see like these dose that like large populations of animals going this way and he's like, you see these animals that are criss crossing? Those are, those are bucks catching the scent and catching the sene of these. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:10:05       Does that, I hadn't heard that. Oh really? Oh, that's interesting. That was subtle. No, I don't know a ton about what I mean. I grew up on white tails. We grew up hunting white tails, not probably using our heads as much as we might have, you know. Well, the one, yeah, we got, we got deer. Yeah. Yeah. The time we went. Right.

Speaker 1:          01:10:24       Doug's farm in Wisconsin, man, my fucking deer. They're everywhere.

Speaker 2:          01:10:28       Yeah. It's crazy. And they're, you're not playing. This is the distinction. Hours make in hunting is

Speaker 5:          01:10:34       okay.

Speaker 2:          01:10:35       I tried to find those places where you're mostly thinking about animals and not so much thinking about hunters. Well you

Speaker 1:          01:10:44       just on that, on your show too though, the difference, like the one time that you went and you were elk hunting in Montana and you know, you were on your way after an elk and you see another fucking hunter that's doing the same thing,

Speaker 2:          01:10:54       multiple everywhere. Yeah. So you spend most of your time wondering about what other guys are doing and then trying to capitalize on that or trying to anticipate the response of animals to that pressure. You know, I so much rather just be like in a one on one thing next week we're going off to hunt Moose up in the Brooks

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       range now and it's one of the, you know, absolutely the most, one of the most remote places, the most remote place in North America. And I'm up there. It's like there's really no, you don't, I, you don't have to factor in effects of other individuals. You're just thinking about the animals, which is fun and it's very rewarding, but it's just not what most people are up against. Like when I was a kid and we're hunting white tails, we really planned on, um, people, you know, it was very important about where all their guys were, what other guys hunting schedules was like, you know, um, there's certain guys we knew that, you know, there's a guy we knew that would always say like, if I see your guys' truck coming down the driveway to the farm, I always go over to such and such place because I know that the way you guys move into your blinds, your likely to bump a deer down such and such fence line.

Speaker 3:          01:12:07       So this guy's thinking about deer shirt. He's thinking about it through the context of, of human activities. So dear being scared by you. And he's like, you guys got that blind down in that area. And I know every time you go in there you don't realize it because you're a dumb ass. But when you go in there, you're bumping deer and they're going down that fence line. So if I see your truck coming on and run over there, wow. Which is a kind of thing. And like elk when I lived in Montana, we would like, our opening day plan was generally find out where elk are, where they've been for a couple of weeks and so that people will know they're there. How are they going to leave that area within three minutes of legal shooting light on opening day and what saddle are they going to use in a pass out of that valley and you would pretty much plan that would be your thing is I know where they're at.

Speaker 3:          01:12:57       I know that they're going to get bumped probably before legal light and where are they going to go after that? I got a friend who has for the last, you know, 20 years man killing elk by he. He knows the spot to elk move into when they get pressured and he knows it. Some people can find these elk with spotting scopes and they'll find these elk on his mountain side. He knows that you, there's no way to approach these elk on his mountain south without spooking him. When he sees the elk have moved into this area, he'll watch him with a spot and scope waiting to see someone else try to climb up and put a move on. These elk when they start climbing up act when he goes, that guy sees him, he's going to go and try to put a move on him.

Speaker 3:          01:13:41       He'll go down an ambush, those elk three miles away from there. Wow. And he waits till someone sees him cause he knows what we're going to go cause he knows the path they always take with me and he calls it the laundry chute cause he said they come spilling through there like laundry, laundry chute. He's been doing it for 20 years. Wow. I really enjoyed that episode that you did this year in Kentucky. Yeah. That you went elk hunting in Kentucky because the situation is very, it's very unique in that they've reintroduced successfully reintroduce elk into Kentucky and

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       instead of like what you're looking at a western hunt where you look at these great wide open spaces and timber and you could see them in the distance. Instead, you're looking at an incredibly dense, like southeast sort of kind of forests where these elk are like, you were like kind of creeping up on him and it was hard for the camera guy to get a good view of some of these Alpha at the Lq shot. Like there's so many God damn trees there.

Speaker 3:          01:14:37       Oh yeah. You're just seeing little portions of, it was funny because when that show in the beginning of that show, we're standing there and uh, you know, predawn darkness and there's like the eastern forest, they're sort of like the cacophony of noise and an eastern forest that you lack in the west, it's lugs and towing. The bio diversity is so much higher, you know, not a large mammals, but the biodiversity of just stuff that Zach has a moisture, I don't know, quality is soil moisture probe. Yeah, I would guess moisture as a huge part of it and probably the for fertility, the landscape, like, like the, you know how nutrient rich the soil is at some base level probably is what's at play. Climate northwest doesn't have those sounds and it's very moist. Yeah, you're right. That's why I was confusing. I know guys that would be able to answer that. I, I dunno. I, I know that for instance, I keep coming back around, you can tell I'm so excited about our hunt on principles. Alex had all, my brother who is an ecologist up there, um, that that elevation band were Prince of Wales Island. Is, is sort of the, the richest marine environment

Speaker 3:          01:15:46       of anywhere. Really. Yeah. So that, that like latitude band is an extremely rich marine environment there as far as the fishing there must be incredible. Yeah. And just, I mean it's just everything. It's like, it's just a buzz with life. Are we going to, we're going to fish there were there were there too? No, no, no. If we get, maybe there's a possibility, but probably not. So it gets a little bit late. Like fishing peaks like July, August is phenomenal. It just kind of halibut. Yeah. But they held, it's so much better in July and August and we were just up there for my brother's Bachelor party and did phenomenally well. Unhealed. But yeah, Doug was sending me pictures. We got some doozies norm some, yeah, some nice tables. So in the beginning, that episode just kind of standing there and um, and, and to hear that noise of the eastern forest, you know, and then to have it be that you're looking for elk is so, it just feels weird for anyone to live with that and hold up a clip, pull up a clip. So people get here cause it's pretty cool. It's you in the forest like on your show where you were, uh, you were explaining it and talking about it.

Speaker 6:          01:16:51       The smell, smell, smell right now seems to have like a warm to him. It's hard to explain, but you just kind of guess that too. Like you'll smell it. Not word outcome words were used, his power games, bed bed, little bats all over here. It just makes sense.

Speaker 7:          01:17:29       Yeah, those things are cool. It's like a ghost in the forest. He shows up. There they are. Man, this is so different. So what norm is too. So they'll say he's got wiped out of that area by eight,

Speaker 2:          01:17:37       1820. Um, and you're like, Daniel Boone, uh, used to cross over to get down into the Kentucky hunting grounds. He would cross over to Cumberland gap, which is very near there. And then he would go to, you know, what we call the blue grass hills. And that was an more open environment and had a lot of elk and people would hunt in Houston, not the blue grass hills for elk, deer hunt for deer and a hundred for black bear selling the meat and heights by 1820 or thereabouts, the elk herd has gone. Okay. The buffalo got shot out. Um, elk got shot out, dear remained black, remained mountain lions were shot out, wolves are shot out and they were gone for over a hundred years. And then when they did it, all that mountaintop coal mining in Kentucky and after the reclamation process, you know, they had chopped down in the construction of these minds, they destroyed a lot of, of hardwood forests.

Speaker 2:          01:18:38       Okay. Like deciduous hardwood forest, Hickory Beach, oh work, all kinds of stuff. But when they reclaimed the left, all these flat mountain top areas that they just did it. And, and, um, you know, grasses and other stabilizing vegetation, not timber. And it created sort of this open savanna like environment and people recognize it to be a good place to put elk. And there wasn't a lot of resistance if you went into an agricultural area and decided, you know, we got a great idea, we're going to bring in thousands of seven, 800 pound herbivores and cuddle loose out here. You would get a ton of resistance. But the areas rural enough and, and the reclaim coal country, that just wasn't a huge interest in not putting them there. And so now they've got the biggest elkert east of the Mississippi. There's 10,000 plus elk run around and Kentucky, but even still al-kurd are like 90% not recovered, you know, I mean, they were everywhere.

Speaker 2:          01:19:43       They were everywhere. And the weird thing about it is we could have as many back, we could totally bring back way more than we have now. But you have a handful of interest that don't like that. Auto insurers generally don't like it. Agricultural interest don't like it, but it's one of those things that we could fix like that. And the Buffalo, the only thing standing between us and restoring buffalo to more of their native range is popular conception, perception of, you know, property, the perception of the issue. The only thing standing between Austin reintroducing elk to more and more of their native range is just selling it to the public. Other problems we have, you know, you look at something like acidification of the oceans, people are like, she's, I have no idea. I Dunno what I, there's no way, right? It's impossible to fix this.

Speaker 2:          01:20:29       It's too expensive. Whatever. We don't know the science, we don't understand the science of it, but some stuff like when it comes to bringing big animals back, oftentimes it's just a matter of do we want to or not? And in Kentucky there was enough people that want it to where they made it happen and now it's a thriving hurt. They're even using that herd they had, they pulled animals. The Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation spearheaded the saying and provided much the money and labor for it. They pulled animals from Kimra for [inaudible] 17 or 20 source sites, moved him into Kentucky. Now Kentucky's a source site for other reintroduction. So they're pulling animals out of Kentucky now and use them to, to, to reintroduce herds and all the places where they were extubated. But what other places are they planning it now? They've got some going into, I know in Virginia to bring in some in, um, I'm not sure if they brought them in in North Carolina, but North Carolina had an aid of hurts.

Speaker 1:          01:21:18       Was this an amazing animal? So the meat is so incredibly healthy. It's really like a, a, a breast, a pound of chicken and a pound of elk. The elk will have last cholesterol. It's healthier for you, less fat, more protein.

Speaker 2:          01:21:32       It's the best. It's the best meat out there man. As far as eating, like the taste of visit is still make, there's no bad elk. They're just good. Even the big giant ones. There's this good man. My brother killed one one time. He had a really hard, it was just tough. He had an age, but you just, you know, you need like a nice facility to be able to consistently age stuff cause the, if the weather's against you, you can't age. Like we're, you know, no one's got, most people don't have a walking cooler where they can go hang 400, 500 pounds of meat. That is what an elk. So if you get one in, it's hot. Oftentimes you've got to get it into a freezer and it'll age a little bit in the freezer. But anyways, he killed one flavor was great, but it was just a tough, tough, tough bowl to chew on.

Speaker 2:          01:22:13       Just a big muscular animal and it's just tough. And um, it was funny cause he uh, he started the, the only vegetable he was interested in eating. I'm going to tell you this was boiled cabbage because he's like, I only have so much muscle power and my jaw and I can't waste any of my jaw muscle power on anything but chewing my elk. So he would eat boiled cabbage and that, and his elk until he got done with it until he saw crowns. Let me tell you a funny start on this guy to like his aversion to waste is a buddy of ours got married one time and and his bride's neighbors were out of town for during the wedding ceremonies. The bride's neighbor says, well, I'll open my house up if you some out of town guests who need a place to stay because I'm on vacation anyways, so they give this house where it's just like for the groomsmen to hang out.

Speaker 2:          01:23:14       I mean, my brothers were in the, you know, were the groomsmen and some other guys and stuff. We get to stay in this house during our stay. He has Okasan. My brother Matt has occasion to peak in the guy's freezer and sees in his freezer that he's got an elk he killed four years ago. It's dated from four years ago and he, he has a moral crisis where he's like, is it worse to steal or is it worse to allow such a beautiful animals flesh to go to waste when this guy inevitably will declare this freezer burned and throw it away. Like if he was going to eat it, he would hate it. Right. Three years ago, three and a half years ago, so when we left he had a bunch of that in his duffel bag and went home and ate it because he couldn't stomach the thought of that animal going to waste like his reverence for it is so high that he can't have, he can't allow someone else to, to trifle with it.

Speaker 2:          01:24:13       How many years is an animal good in a freezer? I'm telling you what man. It depends on the animal lean stuff like elk if you trim away. Okay. Lean stuff like hooved animals who have, who have game animals. If you trim away the fat, which we don't call it that, we call tallow, it's waxy. If you trim that stuff away and you either seal it with a vacuum sealer and then don't mess with the bag, like don't poke any holes in the bag so that the seal stays good and treat it very gently so that this deal stays so the seal stays intact or you wrap it in Saran wrap and then wrap it in wax freezer paper. You could not. Pepsi challenge that stuff. If it was a year old again, stuff that was a month old. What about two years? Three years I've done that too.

Speaker 2:          01:25:03       Two is for me personally, the longest out I've gone is to, I've heard of people going more and at two when you thought and you look at it, you can tell something happened to it where you can trim it up and have it be and I've served at old stuff like that to my wife. No time. It happens to me is if I wind up having something get kind of lost in my freezer. If you don't practice good freezer management like I try to do, what would it be last in, first out, right. But now and then just something happens and you lose track of something and you find some old thing. I've served stuff to my wife that was two years old and she didn't flag it while eating it. He was like user and as an experiment do it. Cause I mean she'll call me out, right? She eats more wild game meat. Most people that, I mean it's, you know, she's wild game meat every night. That's all you have in your home or at home. Yeah, he does. He gave me, lately we've been eating salmon and how that, which you can't really complain about, but you know, she's eating tons of it. She'd recently, um, I'm not allowed, I'm trying to get this overturned, but right now there's a moratorium on bear meat

Speaker 4:          01:26:07       in your house because you've got tricky knows. Yeah. I saw her, her and my kids. She said that you will not serve bear me to my kids. Oh Wow. Because of you getting, as I got the word illness, if you under cook it, it's like 150 degrees. Right. You and know what it is. And I tried to explain that.

Speaker 2:          01:26:24       So

Speaker 8:          01:26:27       w

Speaker 2:          01:26:28       the, the spring we hunted black bears. We have blackberries in the Alaska range. I took a guy hunting who you should have on the show at some point. Is it a guy named Work Denver? And he's a,

Speaker 8:          01:26:40       okay.

Speaker 2:          01:26:41       He, he's just leaving the service now. He's a navy seal commander. And, um, he wrote a book called Damn few making the modern seal warrior and you remember a few years ago that movie act of Valor came out and was all active duty seals. He's one of the stars in that movie and um, took 'em out, bear hunt. He grew up fishing and like to fish a lot, hadn't done any hunting but definitely grew up in the outdoors. And then, you know, obviously over the last 13, 14 years they've been just, he's been just consumed by training and being deployed again and again and again to Iraq and Afghanistan. So he hasn't like messed around outside even those very important him growing up, he just, like I said, he's leaving the service now. I took them out on a hunt and uh, we went to black bear hunting and Indiana.

Speaker 2:          01:27:26       We got on this big black bear and called in with a Predator call and he killed the bear and we walked home. It's a big bore, you know, it's like a six and a half foot bore. And I said, and we're cutting it up. And I'm saying to him on camera, I'm like, I'm telling you what man, if a bear is going to have trick knows this is going to be him. And what I'm talking about was Montana used to do free. Uh, they used to do free testing for trick analysis so you could send in a, they asked for specifically a golf ball sized piece of the tongue and you could send it in to the Msu and an Msu would send you the results on your bare. The first bear ever sent in for testing was from a 17 year old black bear. Whoa. And that bear meat came back positive besides steaks and roasts.

Speaker 2:          01:28:13       I had 83 pounds of ground meat off that black bear. It was a big bear. So I said anything and it comes back and it's positive and once it's positive you are excused from wanton waste laws. So it's illegal to waste game me. Okay. You, they spell out in great detail what you're obligated to retain on an animal in use. There's some areas in Alaska for instance, where you know, if you kill a moose you have to bring the liver home. It's specified like legally you're obligated to salvage, deliver. So they sent a thing saying we're not going to give you a new bear tag but your excuse and if you want to discard the meat you can discard the meat. And I was like, there's no way I'm gonna do that. Right. The only thing worse to me than getting tricky analysis was it was thrown away this bear meat.

Speaker 2:          01:28:59       So I just got to meet thermometer, a nice one and eight the whole bear I went on, I never got another bear tested and they told me, I read this thing, we're saying that these, they did this study Montana where these two counties in northwest Montana, they have really high barrier populations is Lincoln County in Sanders County. And they said the Dave never tested a bear from those counties. That was over six years of age. The didn't have trick analysis. So trigger Knowles is just something that you're not born with it, right? You can, you eat in fact did meet and you can track the disease or you know, and then you wind up having those little cysts, the larva and your muscle tissue and it just is pass along through consumption. It's the reason you're supposed to cook pork to well done. And now it's not really that way anymore.

Speaker 2:          01:29:47       We say I've gotten to the out of domestic pork so much because when they, when they stopped feeding pigs, restaurant slop, they really cut trick analysis. Alex, what they realize is when they're feeding pigs restaurant slop, you're inadvertently giving them rats and mice that are sort of caught up in the cycle of restaurant slop, right. And Rats and mice are big carriers. So once they got rid of then once they made it illegal and they had like only that the USDA inspected pigs are feeding on controlled sources, not stuff from, you know, garbage pails. I used to wash dishes, had to summer camp when I was kid in everyday a pig farmer came and got all the food scraps and he fed him and he was selling inspected pork. So you can't do that now. So now 97% of the black bear cases, or sorry, 90 some percent of the trick and notices cases in the u s come from bear meat.

Speaker 2:          01:30:32       I'm explaining all this to work and the next day I'm explaining to him another interesting thing about black for me, how there's a lot of variability in black Burmese. Some are great, some are not so great. So I'm talking about when I kill a bear, I'm always really interested to get a taste of it to see if we're dealing with, if we got gold or bronze, right. And we started firing, it's rain and we start a little fire and ski rope. Just some pieces, just the sample it and it's raining and we're feeding it the firewood and everything's wet and she's a pain in the ass trying to get it cooked. And eventually I kind of peel this piece apart in my hands. I'm like, yeah, you know, we're cool, we're cool. So there's six of us, we eat it and I don't even think in there or think about it.

Speaker 2:          01:31:20       Right? So the next day we cooked some shanks, but we cook the piss out of the shanks. Like we make awesome Buco brace shanks and cook them for five or six hours. Right. We'd a whole bunch of that, eat some grayling, eat some rainbow trout, go home. A month goes by and I get the shits real bad. So, and it's like a weird kind of the shits. So I send a text message to the guys at work with St. Does anybody have like a weird kind of the shits because I'm worried that we got GRD or something or Crypto spiraea from, from water contamination and um, one of the guys rice bag and he says, no, but man do I got, it's like some pieces, muscle aches, you know, now. Yeah, we'll never mind that. I'm worried about my shit. You know, I'm not worried about your problem.

Speaker 2:          01:32:04       So couple days later I remember I'm like crossing a street and I'm like, God, that's a weird feeling in my back. You know? And it just got worse and worse and worse, and eventually texted this guy and I'm like, what were you saying about muscle legs? Dude, in a while four of us all had it. And when we started putting it together, I was like, we all have the same weird thing. Intense muscle pain and our calves and tense muscle pain in our next fevers and we haven't seen each other for a month. And we all got sick on July five so it was like, this isn't the common cold. So there's an incubation period a month. What has you eat? The only thing that can liberate those larva from their sis is stomach acid. So when you consume the meat, your stomach acid dissolves the the thing and liberates the larva. And you've got boys and girls in there and it takes them forever. It takes them weeks, they build up their numbers, you know they get kicking ass. Then they get into your bloodstream, larva, do an antibiotic month into it. The larva start burrowing out of your vascular system and getting into your muscle tissue when they start setting up shop. Oh my God. So

Speaker 2:          01:33:23       the CDC gets involved in this. Um, I was now in Kings County k and they sent me a thing recently where no one in King's county has had like last year in the whole country. It was like 11 or 12 cases. The trick Nelson, the whole country, no one in King's county had it in four or five years. The last guy that had, um, I think a guy and I think a guy in 2007 or 2011, I can't remember which, where's kings county is Seattle area. He had it from making a homemade mountain lion jerky, like the only guy. So they're all excited and they want me to give him a piece of the meat and I give him a piece of that meat. They come to car and I like go down and hand them a shank off this bear. I told her, I said, if you eat that cookie, you know, and um, she tests it and they get back to me while later. Nothing had 868 larva program,

Speaker 8:          01:34:17       which

Speaker 2:          01:34:17       is something like 460,000 larva propound. Oh my God. There's these blown up images of it and it's just like, it's just larva. So the whole meat, it's just, it's just an festival. Larva, Bam. Must be in misery. I don't know what he's thinking, but I'm fine now. So out of the four of us to get sick, I go down and they say like in severe cases, you know, if it attacks your pulmonary system, but if the larva tech your heart, there's, you'd take it, there's a medication you take. Well, I said, well, I'm just gonna take the medication, you know? And they're like, well, you know, you might not need to. I said, well, I'll take it. I go down on that medications, $2,400 even with health insurance, it's $1,100 to buy the medication. So the other guys are like, well, I'll just wait and see what happens to you.

Speaker 2:          01:35:07       We all get better at the same time and that medication only kills them in your stomach. Right? So for six to 10 years, depending on your source, if you were to eat me under cooked, you would contract. Trigonal says, Whoa, I don't know if that means I have 868 larva per gram. I just have a hard time fathoming that. But we're all positive, like we're positive carriers. Wow. So you right now have those things in your muscle tissue. That's my understanding, and I read a lot about this as you can imagine. Like I was very curious about, I didn't know. I always thought when you got tricking analysis, you died kind of. I didn't know. I thought, I don't know what I thought. I've been writing about this and talking about this on TV for 10 years, telling people in by the way, make sure to, but you know, they say familiarity breeds complacency.

Speaker 2:          01:36:02       You know I what? It was contempt. Is that what it is? Yeah. No. Well then that's my new saying because I felt like, I don't know why I can sit here right now and picture the piece of meat that I'm sure it got me sick, so I don't know what else. Thinking, man, my wife's like is so embarrassing. She's like, you're supposed to be like the mediator and you. I'm like, I'm like, you know what though? And I was embarrassed and it's embarrassing, right? But at the same time, like, you know what word while the mountain here's die, they die on the mountain, you know? So it's not like, oh, you should be the last guy to die in the mountain. You claim to be this big mountain here. And it's like, well, you know what exposure, I don't know. You know, living on it.

Speaker 2:          01:36:41       That's just my way of hiding the fact that I was like really stupid. It was a stupid thing to do and I want to, I remember Dodi saying, are you sure you want people to know that this happened to you because it isn't it kind of embarrassing to you. And I'm like, yeah, it's embarrassing to me, but I'm just going to talk about it. Cookie bear me. So she, yeah, my wife's like, no way that we're just done with the bear meat thing. And my brother and my brother's wedding were at his rehearsal dinner. We're doing all wild game for his rehearsal dinner. So I had smoked up a ham off this bear the longest serve it as rehearsal dinner. He says, don't tell anybody about the warm deal because it'll turn them off to the whole damn meal. And I said, well, I gotta I feel now, like I'll have to say this has been cooked, but Fyi, I got trick gnosis from eating this bear uncooked and he thinks that he's just like, I'd rather you not serve it, then serve it and bring it up. I think you should serve it in Indiana. Decided not to serve it at his wedding. I would have eaten it as long as it's cooked to 150 degrees, especially smoked. I know people aren't like that, man. People aren't like that. I smoked at ham from that pig that we shot and a, I cooked it to finish your in your, your method with the brine.

Speaker 4:          01:37:56       Oh my God. It was some of the best tasting meat I've ever had. It was unbelievable. And that son of a bitch, probably. Yes. I mean not, not probably, but was a very good chance he's got it. They you meet. Yeah. Yeah. It was so tender and delicious, but I've cooked a bunch of it. Just, just put it on the grill, just seasoned it and put it on the grill and it's a amazing how tough it is. Yeah. It can be tall. Shoot through that shit, but tastes good. Did you get a grinder? Yeah, I got to grind, you know? Yeah. I got a grinder for the venison after Wisconsin Cowan and I, we made buckets of hamburger meat. That's good. Oh, it's so you can grind. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:38:29       That wild port to, yeah. I'd be curious just to take a piece of that wild pork and send it in and see if, if it has a, it has trick analysis.

Speaker 4:          01:38:37       Do you want me to, I'll send it in. I Dunno. I mean, what is that? I don't know. What would you do with the information if you knew? Uh, make sure I did what I'm already doing, I guess. Exactly. Yeah. I mean, I, when I cooked it, I cooked that the smoked ham I cooked for like fucking 10 hours or something. Yeah. It took forever. And you get it out to the right temperature. Yeah. Some people even, yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:38:57       Say like Harold Mcgee's science and Laura, the kitchen, her science and Laura cooking, whatever it is. It's a great, it's like the science of food and food cooking and ingredients is a phenomenal reference book in there. He says, it seems to be, I think the, it was in his book, he says, it seems that there's evidence to suggest that freezing.

Speaker 9:          01:39:17       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:39:17       Kills it though. The USDA is still sticks to that guideline of, of cooking temperature, but then like prolonged freezing kills it. But a couple of years ago a couple of guys got trick and from Walrus meet in Alaska. Fucking Wallrose. Yeah. So Howard ass on bitch got it. But he's the Walrus at it and they think that there might be, this worm is tricky. Nela spiral us I think is his name. I got pictures of the thing on my phone, what the world looks like. So, um, that there's, nor they think there's might be some northern varieties

Speaker 9:          01:39:51       okay.

Speaker 2:          01:39:52       In walrus, in polar bear that are less susceptible to freezing and that perhaps that freezing is not to be relied on when killing these worms.

Speaker 4:          01:40:04       That it's a different northern variety that's just got more tolerance. Hey man,

Speaker 2:          01:40:08       this is just something I read at fuck is eating polar bear and Walrus. Wow. People like Walrus. There's the guy, you know, it's funny, I've never had it, but I've been arranging to have some because I drew um, uh, Muskox tag for none of Eric Island this winter. And when you hunt, none of background, if you draw that tag, you have to hire what's called a transporter because the only place the land is a Meeker rock on none of act and it's a native village. Okay. So into it or ask them, oh, village. And these people like your transporter can't do guide services. Like he can't tell you where an animal is, but he's like provides transportation. So you rent snow machines or Harvey getting around and he'll give you a place to stay when you're on the island. It's called a transporter. The transporter that I'm using is a walrus hunter.

Speaker 2:          01:40:55       So they're protected by the Marine Mammal Protection Act. Okay. So like white guys don't go hunt Walrus, but natives who aren't administered by the Marine Mammal Protection Act have their own self governing body called the walrus commission. And I think the wall was commission. I came Emirates that meets and gnome or Kotzebue and the walrus commission will make decisions about what walrus harvest different coastal villages are allowed to have an out there on none of act. Those hunters out there will periodically go and hunt Walrus and the guy I'm using as my transporter goals on the walrus hunts. So I've been encouraging him to make sure to have some that I'd cause I'd like to eat it when I come out and I'd like to do a thing about that and hang out with this guy and eat. We'll always meet and he's going to, he says he's going to make sure to have some on hand and our Wa walruses like when when you, you were hunting walrus.

Speaker 2:          01:41:49       Like you're allowed to eat the meat but you're not allowed to hunt it. So, but if someone can give it to you, could you bring it back? I don't know about, you can't bring the ivory bag. I don't know about transporting the meat. That's a good question. But yeah, I could go into his home and I don't even know the extent of it, but I can go into his home and he can serve me a meal. Just like people might go up to Nome or whatever and sample, mock talk from a whale, you know. Um, but no, I don't, I know I'm fairly certain that he could not give me the ivory, you know, cause there's like the, the ivory ban, so I re has to have a cultural marking on it. You know, you're supposed to turn the artwork. So a lot of times, you know, like sea otters were nearly extra paid in some places like regionally, extra painted by the fur trade, particularly when the Russians were, had a strong presence in Alaska.

Speaker 2:          01:42:37       And now see otter numbers are, you know, really recovered in a lot of areas, but still for natives that are allowed to trap sea otters, they can't just sell the pelt as a pelt. They have to do something to it to make it a cultural item, at which point they can exchange it for money. So if a native hunter kills a Walrus, he can do scrimshaw on that Tusk, you know, and, and that puts that Tusk and a different legal framework than it would as raw, what they call raw ivory. Hmm. That's fascinating. So I know, but yeah, he can serve me a piece of wall. Where's meat? But I don't know. I don't know what laws govern me walking away with some, I have no idea. No seals. They eat seals as well. They're allowed to hunt and eat seals. The, uh, the natives and the Inuits again, it's again, it's self govern.

Speaker 2:          01:43:27       I watched a Bordain show and he was with this family and they were eating a seal and they butchered the whole thing. Yeah. That was in northern Canada. Right. What's the, what's there's like an autonomous, it's sort of like on the autonomous zone there. The name escapes me right now, but yeah, I know what you're talking about. And they're eating it raw. Yeah. That doesn't have chicken houses. I have no idea. Or I don't know if people were surprised to hear that Walrus has had trick analysis. What does a walrus eat? Well, they eat a lot of ELL, clams, crabs. He lost. I just don't know enough. I don't know enough about how that thing, God, I don't know enough about whether what kind of sea animals have that stuff. I mean, was he in a chunk of polar bear that you found frozen? None.

Speaker 2:          01:44:08       I have no idea. I would love to know when I had Lyme disease, I did tons of, I could've gotten an honorary phd in Lyme disease after having Lyme disease, and then when I got trick and Osis, I started reading everything I could find about triggering also, but that just got better one day. That's wild. So then I can read. I quit reading about it just, you just felt better. It's just a win away. Six, seven days. One of the guys that had, he was running 103.9 degree fever for six days and they're checking them for like den, gay fever, West Nile virus. He had no idea to even bring this up. One of the dudes, girlfriends is a doctor and she says, finally, I think you boys got trick analysis. I go into doc and I'm like, here's what I think I got, and they didn't know, didn't know what the hell I was talking about.

Speaker 2:          01:44:52       Well, you said 12 cases a year in the entire country. They never see, and there's four of you. I'm asking me how to spell it once. I was talking about a venereal disease called Sherman Triggerman Nights, but I eventually convinced a man, just like when I had Lyme disease, I walked around having to convince people that I had that Lyme disease is really common though I don't understand, but it just depends on what that per, what that particular, I'll use the term what that particular health care provider has run into, and you go in and say like, oh, I'm not feeling so hot. You know, and this and that. I think I got Lyme disease. It's just like not, I think if you're in Hudson Valley in New York, you're going to walk in, they're going to be like, hell yeah, you got Lyme disease. But in some places they're going to be like, Eh, I don't know what you got.

Speaker 2:          01:45:33       Is it a weird, when you talk to some dot, I mean there's doctors are dismissive of things like real dismissive and then it turns out that you were right. That's got to be infuriating. So that's what I ran into and I, and I've told the story a thousand times, but when my boy, we got tricked, thank God he didn't get trick and he got limes. He's, he and I got Lyme disease at the same time, fish and blue gills. And He, I was at my mom's in Michigan, my mom comes up, she was swimming with the boy and the mom was on the same lake I grew up on and she was swimming with the boy down the lake and she comes up and says, why is his belly button? I'll read like this. I'm like, I can't tell what happened there. And it turned into one of those bowls.

Speaker 2:          01:46:13       I rashes my wife, I send my wife a text image, the text message picture of this thing and my wife right away. It's like, I wonder if he's got limes. He's, it looks like one of those bulls, bulls eye rashes. They talk about Lyme disease. So she tells me send it to his pediatrician because I had him at my mom's, you know, she wasn't there. She's like, send it to his pediatrician. I sent this pediatrician and be like, we're worried about what he's got line. She's like, well, just keep an eye on it, but you don't keep an eye on those things to those things just go away like they don't last forever. Right. So all of a sudden then it's gone. But clearly he had it and so then we wind up going down there because then gets another one somewhere else and we'd go down and we're like, we're really concerned he's got Lyme because he gets this bullseye rash and you're like, well where is it? I'm like, well, it's not there now, but it was there and he keeps talking about this, that and the earthing, different symptoms he's having.

Speaker 2:          01:47:03       We take them in three times each time bringing up, I fear that this is what's going on with him. When we pull them out of the bathtub for whatever reason and the hot water, he's got these damn circles all over them, but they kind of go away. You know, eventually he's got bell's Palsy, he'd take a sip of milk, is milk route at the corner of his mouth, you know, and we go in there like holy shit, he's got Lyme disease now at this point it's been going on for weeks. You know? And what's funny is this place, his pediatrician has a newsletter and they had a newsletter article. There was about Lyme hysteria about how everyone is so hysterical about Lyme

Speaker 2:          01:47:42       being like don't really need to worry about it. You know, everybody's getting hysterical about Lyme. Like it's the new bogey man, you know? So in this altercation we have with the pediatrician, I'm like, I feel that your lime hysteria thinking in your lime history article kind of colored your impression of what I'm telling you when I'm, when we're coming in and you're telling you, and we had to self diagnose our child. At which point they said, I want to have someone else in the room during this discussion. They, they said that have it goes, we were pissed. Well you easily could have sued the shit out of them if you were so inclined. I listen and I don't want her, I'm thinking of that stuff. But I mean I, I was like, I entertained all kinds of ideas if he didn't get better, but he responded so quickly to medication the, uh, but it, it was unbelievable. And meanwhile I had all the same stuff and I thought it was psychosomatic. I wound up having to do the intravenous stuff. You know, Doherty, he was real, he was in the hospital lime meningitis.

Speaker 4:          01:48:34       Well when I ran into you when the last time we went hunting together, you were really skinny and I was like, dude, you look like you lost a lot of weight. I lost a ton of weight during all that. You told me the whole story. I was even trying to drink like, like milkshakes and stuff. Like I was like not at GNC trying to like do stuff and we or all those guys, the guys in wilderness athletes sending me like home. I'm just trying to do anything I can do to put on weight. Wow. There was a, it knocked my dick in the dirt bag, man. I bet. I've heard nothing but horror stories about people getting Lyme disease. I'm nothing but horror stories. It's just it. And then not only that, your body doesn't really ever get rid of it, right?

Speaker 2:          01:49:09       No, it's unclear. You know? And if you like the, the medical, the established.

Speaker 8:          01:49:16       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:49:16       Scholarly consensus online. I think it's still this, that there's no such thing as chronic Lyme is what they'll say is what, when I say they, I mean like the, the medical establishment will say that.

Speaker 8:          01:49:26       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:49:27       That chronic Lyme doesn't exist, that there's Lyme disease and when you go through treatment, like what I did the, the 28 day intravenous deal, they put a line that goes in your arm up to your heart and you inject these syringes in it. Like when you get done with that, you do not have those bacteria in your body anymore. If you go to a Lyme specialist and you tell live specials, I have chronic Lyme, I met one, I tried to get in to see one of these live specialist and she said, category, I don't see Lyme chronic Lyme patients. I see a cute line patients and I had already done one round of antibiotics and I got worse during the round of oral and she's like, oh, your chronic Lyme meaning like, oh, it's all in your head. Why? So I go to another infectious disease person.

Speaker 2:          01:50:09       I was talking to them and they said, well, it's like, it just seems kind of, it's an urban chronic lines and urban legend. My finding wound up in some way, bearing out what she said would happen where I finished the stuff. I think I got done with it sometime in September and by November my symptoms are gone. That's me. My boy got better. But I've met, I've since then met all of the people who are very credible individuals, you know, who are not hysterical people who've been through various rounds of treatment and they're not getting better. The are like the arthritic stuff and limes. Such a weird thing. Like with my kid, you can't argue with bell's Palsy, it's just right there. But other stuff like folks who don't know what that means, if it's paralysis, facial paralysis. Yeah. I mean he had like bad facial paralysis so you can't argue with it. Right. It's just like glaring. And that's one of the key. That's one of the bulls eye rash, Bell's palsy. But there's all these other things like a arthritic pain. Okay. Um, fatigue. They don't think a lot of people think that all the time they were diagnosing. Chronic fatigue syndrome was people with limes, people, Lyme disease.

Speaker 1:          01:51:13       My friend's dad got it from the, from getting vaccinated. They used to have a vaccination against Lyme disease. But the problem with it, a small percentage of people that go up vaccination would have some genetic marker that would make them predisposed to getting fucking Lyme disease from this vaccine. He's guy was terrified to getting Lyme disease, gets a vaccination against Lyme disease, got Lyme disease from the vaccination, and then they stopped making the Lyme disease vaccination. So this poor guy has fucking Lyme disease and he's still fucked up. He's an old guy. It's her dad and he's, you know, he's jacked from this fucking vaccination.

Speaker 2:          01:51:51       I haven't checked this from multiple sources. I just heard this or read this, that, um, couple of interesting facts about Lyme is one, when my son and I both got it, I remember being like, what are the odds? Because you'd read that one or 2% of ticks carry Lyme. So I'm like, we would have had to have been covered in hundreds of ticks for both of us to have, you know, statistically for both of us that have gone without even seeing any ticks. Like, how could this be? Now later read the, in that area in New York, an area in Hudson valley, they'd done some stuff for 60 or 70% of the ticks have Lyme and they used to chronicle 30,000 confirmed cases. You know, every year, I think last summer they were close to 300,000 this is blown up. It is not so much that is blowing up in new places. It's just that is becoming like much more common in other places.

Speaker 1:          01:52:43       Isn't there a direct correlation between overpopulation of deer

Speaker 2:          01:52:46       and and these ticks? Some people say that because it's like in that things lifespan, you know it gets on deer, but I've heard all their things that even just like rodents, you know, so like, like smaller furred animals. I'm not really clear on that man. I don't really know. I know that when you look at places that have it, you look at places that have a lot of deer, but I don't know if if you had a third as many deer, if you'd have higher or lower or if you'd have necessarily lower infection rates. I can't answer that. But Doug, Darren, who you know, I think last summer twice he got put on the, the immediate antibiotics because now when you find one of those ticks buried in yet, if you go into a doctor and if you're not weird about medication, the doctors is going to give you a super heavy dose of antibiotics.

Speaker 2:          01:53:28       It kills it before it gets a hold of you. If you wait like I did, it gets into your nervous system. So I even had, I even had for a day I had amnesia where I'm sitting at my desk and I get up to do something and I sit back down and I didn't know who wrote what's on my computer. Whoa. I started, I knew I had to write about a subject cause I knew that before the Amnesia kicked, I lost the whole day. I lost like eight hours of time and I knew that I was supposed to write about a subject and here was a thing on my computer about that subject. I started taking sentences.

Speaker 9:          01:54:06       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:54:06       And our first, I took a big block, like a paragraph of text and put it into Google to try to find how I cut and paste, how I managed to cut and paste an article on the subject I was supposed to be writing about into a word document, but there's no match. Then I just started taking like little blocks of words in quotes and there's no match. I'm like, this is not from online. Then I start thinking that one of the guys I work with, I thought this Guy Jared, Andrew Candace who was near there who works at CPC, I started thinking that he somehow is playing some joke on you were. He came and wrote about what I was supposed to write about on my desk. I also have a book, one of my favorite books called hunt high by Dunkin Gilchrist and on I had written a Mark Boardman Vortex optics.

Speaker 2:          01:54:57       Okay. I look at the book. I know the book. I know who mark Bormann is, but I can't imagine why Mark Boardman's name would be on a sticky note on that book and I look at my other hand. On my hand, I have l o p written an lop is a term length of pull, it's a firearm term and a guy wanted a length of pull off a firearm and I row lop on my hand. I looked at my hand like I didn't know who put that there, how long it had been there, what it meant. And I tried to go home and couldn't get home. He couldn't figure it out. I got on the wrong train, got off at the wrong spot. We were living in Brooklyn, got off at the wrong spot, came up, recognized a sport, recognize the like a sporting goods' like a sports place called a camera. It doesn't matter what it's calling a sporting his place and um, call my wife and told her that's where I was. And then all of a sudden things started making more and more and more and more sense. Wow. Dude, it was wild, man. I thought I was dying. I thought I was dying.

Speaker 1:          01:55:56       We did an episode of that. Uh, Joe Rogan questions, everything show on more jelly beans. More Jones is this disease that most doctors dismissed. They think that the people that are saying they have this, that there's something wrong with them psychologically, that they have some sort of a psychosomatic issue. And that what they're really doing is scratching themselves until they create these abscesses. And, and then sometimes even putting things in their skin and then claiming that these things have been growing out of their skin because they found like carpet fibers and stuff in their skin that these people sent in. Uh, but then, um, when we went to these conferences where these people would meet that have this more challenge issue, he realized you're also talking about some seriously educated people and some of them, their doctors. And one of the doctors that we talked to said there's a direct correlation between more gentleman's disease in people who have Lyme disease.

Speaker 1:          01:56:47       I was all right. And what he said is very intelligent guys. What does an a nutter? And what he said is that he believes that there was a neurotoxic effect that you get from Lyme disease, from some strains of Lyme disease. Cause the way he said was, if you look at Lyme disease, he goes, you're not looking at like if, if a tick infects you, you're not looking at just Lyme disease. But it's possible you might've gotten 10 different. Oh yeah man, I learned about a lot of that stuff. Yeah. And that one of those 10 different things is causing this neurotoxic effect that literally is making you go crazy. So when these doctors are examining these people and they said, oh they're crazy, they think that carpet fibers are growing out of their skin. No, they have Lyme disease and the Lyme disease along with all this other shit is causing this neurotoxic effect.

Speaker 1:          01:57:35       And that is what's making them think that there's something wrong with your skin. So it's not that they're just crazy. I said they have a disease as making them go crazy. And that was pretty illuminating because this guy was talking about like seeing things like seeing like worms underneath his skin or eyes when he's looking in the mirror. And he goes, and I knew it wasn't there, but I'm seeing it anyway. And he goes, I could feel it moving across my eye. But then there was nothing there. And he's like, and it was pretty clear to me as a doctor that there was something going on with my mind. Nope. That had a direct correlation between this disease. So all these people that have this more jealous, they also have this Lyme disease.

Speaker 2:          01:58:12       You know, I don't know if Dan Dodi told her about this, but he all of a sudden has this excruciating neck pain and he goes down to a emergency room. This is the same time this is going on. When he goes down an emergency room, it's like, oh, he got like, they give him some muscle relaxers or something and he comes back home when it gets worse than weirder. He goes down to another place and they tell him the same thing. He got pinched nerve and, and we're text message and about, I was like, Hey, what's going on? You know, high feeling. And I remember that when I was

Speaker 4:          01:58:42       finally talking to a law, a person knew about Lyme. They kept telling me to move my neck and see if it hurt and I told Dorothy, I said, you know what? When I was down there, they kept asking me to move my head is my neck feel weird, go down to that place. So he just leaves his one doctor, takes a cab down to this place where I had gone and they admit him and he had meningitis, was spent out in the hall, you know, four or five, six days in the hospital, wound up with the picc line and meningitis from Lyme and Zaydis whoa cause in in your like an infection in your spinal fluid. I have a friend who died from that died from meningitis. He went to the hospital, went into the emergency room and he was a, he was a comic and he was, he's one of these, he was real busy and you're just like fuck this place.

Speaker 4:          01:59:24       They're making me wait too long. I'm leaving. And he got out of there, got on a plane, flew to Hawaii. When he got to Hawaii he was dying. It's all right. By the time he got there. It was too late. I was, yeah, I was scared cause I remember but there's, I guess there's different forms. There's been anyways, his, they did a spinal tap and you know he was all messed up and meningitis is subscale. Sean, I've had some of the weird, in the last three or four years I've had just some of the weirdest like freaky health things, but they're parasites. Mandy, you've had giardia or something. I got a colon infection from water and that was from the other show, right? That was from like wow. Within, no, that was doing meat eater. So I had, I like, I got really bad poison oak was on steroids for that, but also got some kind of waterborne parasite and then the steroids combat your ability to fight infection. I want up in the hospital when I'm like shit in my own couch. My wife's like, I was like, listen, you know there's nothing now. She's like, I felt bad about like having you be there when I was having babies. She's like, you got, I got, you got dusted off and you know your own coach. So I couldn't even tell when it was happening, you know? Wow. I thought, oh man. Again, I thought I was gonna die. So anyways, I just had like just the weirdest stuff. [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          02:00:44       he's like, you need to go to a shaman because he thinks that there's some thing like I need to have like, like there's some sin I committed against the universe or something and he thinks I need to go to a sham and to get right. Doty did too much t he did too much DMT. Trust me, you can do too much. You gotta you gotta be careful with the fucking IOWASCA. That's hilarious. That whole Sharman things she says is a real trip. You know, the whole going to the jungle and taking that medication and having these spiritual experiences, it'll get you convinced that everything's all tied together and that somehow or another you've committed some sort of a sin against the university. I gotta I gotta let you talk to, I can't even, I don't want to speak for the boy. I'm already talked about them too much. I think Jody. Yeah, no, we'll Doty. And I had a long, extensive conversation about his IOWASCA experience and I've never done Iowasca but I've done DMT many times. I did it again recently, did it last weekend. And the, the DMT

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       experiences essentially what Iowasca is a orally active version of DMT. Okay. Because the Amazon Shaman and the people is derived, it's from two different plants. Okay. Well what are those little, the first thing about this stuff, DMT is dimethyltryptamine and it exists in thousands of different plants. And the reason why you don't get it, like you don't get high when you eat it is cause your stomach produces mano aiming oxidate. So Mano Aiming Oxidase, um, what you need to do is take an inhibitor so that you could get it in an orderly, an orally active form. So most of the time when most people get DMT with they're getting is the synthesized version where they've taking, um, a coach, you're a Veritas or all these different plants. They've extracted it down to the DMT and then you smoke it. Um, and what they do in the Amazon, it's regulated in the u s or not, it's illegal.

Speaker 1:          02:02:30       Oh, schedule one. The issue was scheduled with it being a drug though, is that exists in so many different forms. You would have to make grass illegal. I got like if you had flareups, grass growing in your front lawn, you essentially have a schedule run drug growing on your lawn in massive quantities. So it can't be enforced. It's a weird but, but if they find the powder, if they find it synthesized and turned into a powder that you could smoke and freebase then it's illegal and then it's a schedule one drug. But it exists in your own human neuro chemistry. It's like making saliva illegal with you. Literally that ridiculous. Um, the Amazon Shaman have figured out a way to take the vine of one plant and the roots and the leaves of another and they boil them together. So essentially they use harming, which is a natural Mao inhibitor and they combine it with this plant and they boil it into this potion and that's what Iowasca is.

Speaker 1:          02:03:24       So it's DMT and an Mao inhibitor together and this elixir, you drink it and you have see what's close to this smoked DMT experience as you can get a but not quite as potent, but it's not, it's not, there's not a synthetic version of IOWASCA. No, no, no. Well, like it's all extracted from plants like DMT has is not like they don't produce it in land. Thank you can produce it in a lab. I think you can, but the precursors of it are very tightly controlled by the DEA. Like you can't, like if they found out that you were buying a certain amount of this chemical that you would use to make the synthetic version of it, they would flag you. Gotcha. But the plants are legal, so you could go online. There was a guy that got arrested and they took all of his money and locked him up in jail because it was, I think it was called happy frog or something like that.

Speaker 1:          02:04:13       One of the, the name of his company, I don't remember the name of his company, but he sold all these legal plants, but the plants were all totally legal, but he sold them with the pretense that you could take these plans and extract DMT. And then he was, he was arrested for that because he was putting a and B together for you. Yeah, he, well, he was allowing you to find the source to do it yourself. But even though what he was selling was legal, I think he got off, I'm kind of speaking out of school here because it was a few years back and I didn't totally paid too much attention to it, but it, it is in so many different sources. It is a hallucinogenic. Yes it will. It's a human neurotransmitter and an incredibly potent drug. That's also the most transient drug ever exist or, uh, one of the most transient trucks ever observed.

Speaker 1:          02:05:01       So if you get, like if say if you'd smoked DMT like I did, like I said last week, your blasted to the center of the universe for about 15 minutes and then you're back to baseline. Like you're completely sober in 15 minutes if your body knows exactly what to do with it. Yeah, your body knows exactly what to do with it because it's, it's such a normal part of your chemistry that you're, your body can bring it back to baseline within minutes to weird. It's the weirdest shit ever. And the weirdest aspect of is, while you're blown out, like blown out in this intense psychedelic state, you immediately think, I'm here all the time. I've been here before. Oh, I know what this is. It does. It's not unfamiliar. It's completely alien, but yet familiar at the same time. So Doty in all those Iowasca experiences that he had when he was talking about all these flashbacks and all this craziness.

Speaker 1:          02:05:52       What happens is you open up this, it's a weird effect where if you do DMT and you have these powerful experiences, you open up this door and I don't know what the chemical effect of it is or what the mechanism is, but something happens when you open up that door where you can open up that door again, even in a dream. And so the speculation is that what, what, what happens when people have like near death experiences, when people have alien abduction experiences, when people have these crazy things they say happened to them, most likely what it is is some sort of a weird and dodginess dump of DMT. Like you know, something can happen to you when you get this crazy adrenaline rush. They believe that it's possible that something can happen to you and you get a crazy DMT rush and that it's, it's, it's very difficult to access, but that it's a function of the brand is causing you to, for lack of a better word, is causing you to trip.

Speaker 1:          02:06:48       Yes. But you might perceive it as a memory. You could perceive it at, well it feels as real if not more real than reality itself cause it's intensely colored and brightly lit and the, there's no borders to things. But yet there are, it's very, very, very difficult to describe. I'm doing a terrible job describing it and all around you. It's alive with entities and these entities are communicating with you both with sound and with visual cues. It's a very, very, very weird trip. Uh, you think in a negative way or if you try to control it are like literally shake their finger at, you can go into an an an an an anonymous, but then if you get it right, it calms down. Like it's, it's like a lesson. How to think. It's a very, very bizarre, bizarre trip. The most bizarre at of all the psychedelics, by far, the way I describe it is mushrooms times a million plus aliens.

Speaker 1:          02:07:43       Yeah, it's the Mandalah. It's the center of the, of the Mandala of all this is Mckenna described it, the Mandalah of all the different psychedelic experiences, the center of it, the, the literally the fucking 0.0. The event horizon of that is DMT. So do you feel like, uh, to to, to do it, do you feel like you're being recreational or constructive construct? I try not to do anything recreationally. I smoke a little weed recreationally, have a drink recreationally. But I think psychedelic experiences there, so beneficial. I've gotten so much benefit out of them that I don't, I don't like, I feel like it'd be, it'd be a waste to do you mean like personally or as a performer? Personally. Personally, yeah. Well, as a performer, you know, eventually, personally, first and as a performer I benefit from the, you know, whatever I get out of it personally because, I mean, it's all tied together with you, but you know, you don't think of funny jokes or something.

Speaker 1:          02:08:41       No, they, the people don't tell you funny jokes that you can put into your eggs. Nope. Nope, nope. No. It's all about correcting your, your bullshit. It's almost like, all right, you haven't been here awhile. Come on. And we've got to say it like go into the dentist and you ever been to a dentist in like two years. You're one of those fucking guys sit down and sit down and they find all kinds of got going on here. Oh you got this? Why are you thinking about this? That, that, that, that the, the, the, the, the don't think about that. That's just stupid. You wasted your time thinking it's like they sort of explained to you w w the wasted paths that you're taking with your thinking and your mind. And then even with your actions. So how long, how long do the 15 minutes feel like why did several in a day, so I did a three or four 15 minute ones in a row.

Speaker 1:          02:09:25       So a, you know, like just blast off, come back to baseline, hit it again. Would you be like, man, that was just 15 minutes or would it feel like you were gone like days now it doesn't feel like days. It, it, it's, it feels like it's, when you're in the state itself, it almost feels like time doesn't exist. Like you're not seeing it unless you think about it too much. Like sometimes I'll think about like, I don't want this to end so quick, and then they like Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah. Stop thinking all this stupid shit. Like you're wasting your time. It's like, imagine enjoying a great movie and being like, man, this movie's going to end soon. Movies only 10 minutes in and I know it's only got an hour and 50 minutes to go. Shit, I wish it could go on forever. That's a wasted thought.

Speaker 1:          02:10:08       Like why not just be in the moment and enjoy it? So it's, you know, that that expression be in the moment is like so overdone and hippie and fucking yoga. Like so many people say things like that. And it just makes you moan like, oh, he shut the fuck up because it's like, it's so cliched and annoying when they say, I know you're saying there's wisdom in it. And unfortunately there's just so many of these fucking fake spiritual people that clog up all these words and they ruined some of these definitions because you know, oh, just be in the moment. Find your center. Oh fuck you. Okay, I'm not listening to your car. Like I used to take yoga from this guy who was a total bullshit artist. He was a good yoga instructor, but he was, he was intoxicated by the fact that he was teaching yoga and then all these people came to him and his ego would feed off of this is yoga class to the point where he would say all these things and you would see people roll their eyes. Like my wife used to hate him because he was so cheesy. And then you'd like kind of hit on the ladies that would be there and he want it fucking some dude's wife. And it was like a disaster. Left his wife and she left her husband and now they're miserable together. It's was like he was like a fake spiritual guy. And these fake spiritual people, they have this way of ruining a lot of like really wise notions. One of them, yes,

Speaker 2:          02:11:28       because they use, they're using it. Yes.

Speaker 1:          02:11:29       Tool. Well, you know, it's like, or they're claiming to be enlightened when really they're just a student on the path and maybe they have some good ideas along the way to enlightenment, but they're not quite there. You know, there's a lot of that man. It's like a lot, a lot of people searching like this and these new age type people that are searching for some sort of a meaning. And if you find the wrong Sharman, you find the wrong Yogi, find the wrong guru. You could go down a bad path. I mean, the guy who was the head of Bikram Yoga is got like all these rape allegations of sexual assault allegations. He drives a fucking Bentley everywhere. He's loaded, he's got fucking gold crusted Rolexes. And he's like, clearly not a spiritual enlightened guy, but he's the head of this whole beek rum movement, which is like filled with all these pseudo spiritual people.

Speaker 2:          02:12:20       You know, I was sitting there one day reading a book, reading Al Sharpton's, most recent books. Finally she do the long story and in Crayon, no, my agent and my literary agent, a representative Al Sharpton, did a book with all sharp. So I'm reading and Al Sharpton Book and I'm sitting there in a, in a guy's coming down the road walking a dog and he looks like he's like a yachtsman who guy walking a dog is like clearly a yachtsman like yes, his world. And he comes up and says to me, you know, you know I had a meeting with him one time and he came up in a chauffeured car and he had a Rolex watch on and he proceeded to tell me how he lives on a $23,000 a year salary. It's like wow. Hoses. I don't know how old that story was. I don't know how true to story was. It was Kinda like he was sort of like pointing out the, you know,

Speaker 1:          02:13:21       well there was a guy with a gun, like a, like a like an apparent discrepancy or there's a massive discrepancy. There was a guy once it was on this radio show that I was listening to that was, I'm the head of a corporation that was approached by Jesse Jackson because there were some, something had gone on something where they're racial insensitivity was, you know, was there've been accused of something that was racial, racially insensitive. So Jesse Jackson came on and essentially the pitch was you are going to hire my company to give seminars on racial sensitivity and it's going to cost you a quarter million dollars a year and if you do not, we are going to protest. You were going to make it miserable. We were going to cost you far more than it would then you would spend to have my company come in the Rainbow Coalition or whatever the fuck.

Speaker 1:          02:14:09       Isn't that extortion? It's illegal. It's not illegal. It isn't. It isn't. I mean it is illegal if you call it extortion. But what he's essentially saying is it's within your best interest to align yourself with grace out of court settlement. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And out of court settlement that they profit from it in an incredible way. But he had like all these crazy demands, like he wanted to have shrimp cocktail like a, like Jesse Jackson had all these like very specific demands as far as the kind of food, the amount of food that he was to be given, what, what was supposed to go on. You know, what kind of car he's supposed to be picked up in. And you know, you look at Reverend Jesse Jackson though, he's a religious man. Well where's he getting all this fucking money? He is a wealthy, wealthy guy and he's wealthy by being what they call a race pimp. And that's how this guy was describing it. He was like, he's a race pimp. Like this guy finds these scenarios where something goes wrong, moves in and then extract money from the situation. I should send you my al Sharpton Boat. I won't read it.

Speaker 2:          02:15:09       You won't read it because it's a really good chapter. Is One really good chapter in that book where he talks about, um, how people's positions on things evolve over the years. And I thought that was good. Then there's a really horrible chapter where he talks about how his role in comforting Michael Jackson's family upon Michael Jackson's death, or he, he's, he's sort of presents himself as the great hero. And I think I read, you know, my age was like, you're the last guy in the world. I would expect to read a, um, uh, Sharpton book, but I tell him, I said, well, here's the thing. That's probably why I'm reading it, because all my life I've heard about this guy. I, I really don't understand who he is or what he does. Well, he's just one of these names, you know, it's like almost like he's always got a name, like Peta people hear it and they roll their eyes.

Speaker 2:          02:16:01       Do you mean like, it's almost become like, um, he'd cringe to hear someone say us, but it's almost become like, like he's almost the punchline. Yes. He is a friend for so many people. You know, if somebody pundits and commentators, you know, I realized that I was kind of a victim of that or not victim mode. I was like a doing that. Right. I couldn't tell you what the guy did. I couldn't tell you what he stood for. But you thought of them as a punchline. Yeah, I just knew that of him, you know. Well,

Speaker 1:          02:16:25       you know the Tawana Brawley the, the case that got him. Yeah, he wrote, he talks about that. Yeah. It was hilarious. I mean he represented a woman who made up a fake allegation of being raped by white people and then wrote things on her body and it turns out none of it happened and she just made it all up and he was demanding, you know, justice and all this crazy shit. And he was, you know, on every television show and all throughout, you know, the, the news cases and all this different shit. And it turned out that what he was doing was just, it was based on, nothing was based on all lies. It was based the entire scenario. Jay jetted him into the public eye. It was a fake scene. Yeah. I can't tell you whether I read that in this book or whether one of the many people who saw me reading the book and had to come and give me their 2 cents on the subject told me, well, it's amazing that the guy became famous for demanding justice for something that never took place, but it's a perfect analogy where it's a perfect representation of who he is and also how bizarre our sensitivities are to race that will, this fucking clown is on Msnbc or CNBC or whatever the fuck he is giving his opinions, all these different things and his opinions are brutally dumb.

Speaker 1:          02:17:38       Like his, his way of commuting. When he asked to communicate, we asked to debate people who are intelligent or nuanced opinions on these subjects like his, he's clear and obvious bias and his is cookie cutter idea of racism in America. Like racism is a real issue without a doubt. But having a guy like that represent the black community almost fosters racism. It's almost like if I was a racist and I wanted to make sure that people had a negative opinion of black people, I would take the most clownish cartoon versions of black leaders and feature them prominently on television or reinforce these ideas of these cartoonish figures being this is what represents the black community. Isn't the black community silly? You know, and that's what happens. Instead of getting a Neil degrasse Tyson, a Cornell west, instead of getting these super intelligent, very articulate people with broad, broad perspectives, you get this goofball with a fucking conked hair and you know, a stapled stomach and he's a, he's a goofball and he's many thousand dollars suits on television demanding, you know, reparations for slavery.

Speaker 1:          02:18:44       It's like, come on man, like this is, it's almost a set up. It's almost like the engineer racism. Jesse Jackson barely can speak English. I mean he's obviously an educated guy. You obviously is articulate, but his w if you're a professional speaker, which essentially he is, his ability to enunciate words is so sloppy and so confusing. It's like, do you know how you sound like you almost sound like you're doing this on purpose. You know, when does this, when you would talk, cause this is like you, you listen to him talk. It's almost like he's too lazy to say the words in a way that everyone can understand though. There's like a, he likes the cadence of it in some way.

Speaker 2:          02:19:28       Yeah. They used to do this. Neil degrasse Tyson never speak out or does he ever, have you ever heard him speak on race? Talking about race?

Speaker 1:          02:19:33       I never have heard. I'm sorry to hear him talk about what he talks about professionally. Yeah. He's talked about some other science based things. Not just a astrophysics. I've, I've heard him speak on genetically modified foods and some misconceptions. Some people. Yeah. Yeah, I've heard him speak on some other things that people have some misconceptions of, you know, just sort of science based stuff. But I haven't heard him speak on race. He's an interesting guy. He's a fun dude

Speaker 2:          02:19:58       thing on the incomprehensible universe. That series. Yeah, it's an amazing story. I think it's like, I think it says what it's called.

Speaker 1:          02:20:06       Have you seen the cosmos? The, the, the new version of it? It's great. It's great because it also, he made it very accessible, this version of the con, like the story of Giordano Bruno, I think that's his name, the guy who was burned at the stake for suggesting that the universe is infinite and that they were like, why are you fucking crazy bitch? We're going to light you on fire unless you tell it the less you repent, that there a brick wall, a brick wall out there as a ceiling out there and behind that is a door and God's out there, you know, and he, he was convinced that it, that wasn't the case, but he did the whole Giordano Bruno thing. He did it in animated form. It made an animation of it, which is fantastic. It also made an animation form, which you'll be interested in showing how wolves became dogs and over the course of human civilization evolving how these wolves who had become friendly with people had eventually gotten to the point where the people were feeding them. And the wolf stayed close and then those wolves had slowly but surely morphed into dogs. That's on cosmos. Yes. Yeah. Amazing.

Speaker 2:          02:21:08       There's so much wild stuff coming out of, um, did you say you, do you know about those Russians that were taken fox taken Fox and this? Yes. And selective breeding. I don't know. Just how fast you can change stuff. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:21:19       Yeah. Amazing. You can. Yeah. When you all you, all you need to do is look at what they've done with dogs. You know, the, the time that human beings have been mean. What is the established timeline for agricultural civilization is? What is it? 10,000

Speaker 2:          02:21:36       yeah. 10 11,000 years anatomically modern here. Like pick your number but 100,000.

Speaker 1:          02:21:43       Yeah. So in that time, which is a blink of the eye, you've made a fucking poodle out of a wolf. Yeah, man. You've made a Chihuahua

Speaker 2:          02:21:52       one for one Americans for first pass. And in North America they weren't like breeds of dogs. This is like the dog. They head. That's crazy. You know, they weren't, they didn't have like, that's 40014001500 not at all. 50 probably some, I mean it's hotly debated number, but sometime between like some for our oldest sites are 14,000 years, but people think there has bee sites we haven't found or we'll never find that are older, maybe 20,000 years.

Speaker 1:          02:22:20       But when like, like say when like Daniel Boone came across America. Oh No, they had breeds.

Speaker 2:          02:22:26       They had breeds. Oh yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:22:27       When did they start having like when is it a standalone? Do you have no idea? It's so fascinating.

Speaker 2:          02:22:32       There's probably like, I'm sure there's great stuff written about it, but you know, like they had, so when the first Americans migrated in North America, they were traveling with a domestic version, you know, something that had been domesticated for quite some time, a domestic version of the Eurasian Wolf. And then they came down and here you had a number of wild canines, you know, wools, which the animal they were traveling with could breed with wolves. You now find that in certain cases, wolves and coyotes, they don't, they don't, I don't think they always put off viable young, but they do think that there are hybridization events between wolves and coyotes. So at some point these guys came down with this Eurasia Wolf. There was probably the, almost, certainly there had been some in, you know, some inbreeding with wolves and an out of that stock.

Speaker 8:          02:23:28       Okay.

Speaker 2:          02:23:28       Created Lord knows what all you know, because by the time Lewis and Clark like you know when Lewis and Clark were out and they were eating dogs, the plains tribes, they had those dogs weren't showing like there hadn't been dogs that came from Europe, from colonists, hadn't put dog blood into the dog blood and they came and they had a dog that looked like, yeah, other, what they call it. Like it looked like what they now call him Vietnamese Amit dog. Like just like a Mutt dog. Multi like with multiple colors on them. There was a recent, yeah

Speaker 1:          02:24:00       thing where they've done a genetic study on certain hybrids where they've found a hybrid that's park, coyote, part wolf and part domestic dog. Is there a, yeah, is really recent. Really rich

Speaker 2:          02:24:12       prize. Because one of the things people look at is a, why are, you know, coyotes in the east or just different, the beggar, you know, they feel that there's, that there, that there was hybridization events of wolves and coyotes. They gave you kind of like a, like a bigger cow. The East and you have smaller coyotes in the west. Yeah. This is a, from the Washington Post,

Speaker 1:          02:24:32       uh, Coyote Wolf Hybrids are prowling Rock Creek Park and DC suburbs. What the fuck, man? Real. This is it. Yeah. This is a coyote wolf hybrid in the Washington DC suburbs

Speaker 2:          02:24:45       and that nuts, Koi, Koi wolves.

Speaker 1:          02:24:48       And they've, uh, they've recently, um, established that wolves have returned to California, the first known wolf, uh, you know, within x amount of coming out of where fall. Find out

Speaker 2:          02:25:01       is it like, uh, the red wolves coming out of Arizona, New Mexico?

Speaker 1:          02:25:07       I'll tell you right now, because it's a, a, a totally new thing that they've proven it's from,

Speaker 2:          02:25:14       yeah. This, it's a, where they've established it.

Speaker 1:          02:25:19       Um, the wolf's controversy, we will return to California. It's on Popular Science magazine. Uh, popular opinion is divided and how to manage the gray wolf. So it's a gray wolf. 2011, a male gray wolf called oh are seven left his pack and Oregon and traverse w 1200 miles to California with a sore travel is an atypical for gray wolves. That terrain or seven covered set him apart from the pack. He became the first confirmed wolf in California in almost a century. Maybe kid. Yeah. And so had he been collared and Oregon, he must've been. It's good question. It must've right if they've figured out where he is.

Speaker 2:          02:25:57       You know, a guy in Missouri one time killed one outside of his chicken coup, we thought was a coyote. Nothing had come from Michigan's upper peninsula. Well, there was a guy who crossed the Mississippi,

Speaker 1:          02:26:05       they killed a mountain lion in Connecticut that turned out to be from South Dakota. You're about that fucking thing.

Speaker 2:          02:26:12       I'm telling you. I was like, I don't mean to say like I was on this story long ago, but you know, my entire life, this debate about where La Mountain lions, it turned up in the east or werewolves that turn up and we were places my entire life has been this battle between people who'd be like, oh, it's escape pets, it's escape pets. You know? And now it's becoming clear that in so many of these cases it's not things just leave now and then and they have a very clear sense of purpose and they travel tremendous distances.

Speaker 1:          02:26:49       Or seven, they actually got a trail cam photo of this thing in California.

Speaker 2:          02:26:53       Yeah. And it used to, every time someone saw something like that, people be like, oh, you didn't see it or you saw an escape pet and you'd think that like every household had a mountain lion pat to account for all the lines of guys. It'd be like, it was a damn lion. Like I found where something had killed a deer. I went back. The next thing, there's a lion sitting there, biggest and escape pet. This is pretty proficient, you know, it's, my whole life has been going on and now finally, I mean the guys that have been pushing for this, I've ever finally got to feel a lot better when now that through tracking devices we're able to go like, yeah, a wolf decided one day, you know, to leave there and go down. There was a grizzly that one day decided to Mosey out of the Rockies and made it out into eastern Montana.

Speaker 2:          02:27:35       You know, there's an elk that did, uh, many. Usually it's, you know, usually these wide range and predators. They got wolverines that I was just reading a thing about. They had a wolverine a little, because this winds up being an interesting, they did a rate, they're doing a radio collar studying Alaska about a road there. They think about putting a road in into the Juno area. Okay. So they've been doing a study on animal movements in that area to try to anticipate how this road might impact wildlife and and to just to see about their migration patterns and moving her parents. They went in and collared a bunch of stuff. They had a radio collared Moose fall into a crevasse in a glacier and then a radio collared bear tried to go in there and get 'em out in Phelan and died. And I think that was then scavenged by a radio collared Wolverine.

Speaker 2:          02:28:33       They also had a wolverine. They had a wolverine collard there, get caught by a trap or 250 miles away and BC. Wow. 250 miles it would walked. Wolverines are really rare. Fine. They're rare to find Tony. That is one of the last things of large, you know, like North American fauna. That's one of the last things I'm looking for. You're looking for a wolverine. I have not laid eyes on one. My friends that, uh, beyond a saw one Caribou hunting, uh, my brother Dan, he was hunting spring bears one time and saw wolverines digging through the debris field at the base of an avalanche looking for critters that got swept up in the avalanche. Or I've got a handful of friends and seen when I haven't seen one yet. Those just badgers and wolverines and those types of animals are so bizarre. Dude, I was driving, I was driving down the hall road, the Trans Alaska pipeline road.

Speaker 2:          02:29:29       And you know, you're up. Like if you go, if you're on that road, like the pipe, the road that parallels the Alaska pipeline, Dalton highway, if you're on that road and you go west, you're not going to, you, depending on your line of travel, you won't hit another road til year in Europe and in Russia. And then you go the other direction. You're going to get way into Canada for you hit her though. I mean you're in the middle of nowhere and not in the middle of nowhere, but it's very remote relative to anything we can comprehend down here. Driving on that road one time. Um, all out steps, the links. Okay. And it looks like it's like a cat with a baby's face on it, like a human babies face on it, man. I'll steps the links and like it's level to be, to have an animal look at you like that and it just, with utter lack, lack of comprehension.

Speaker 2:          02:30:23       Like, I can't say this for sure, but more than other animals. You feel that he had never seen that before? Never seen a person. It's just like usually like you'll see an animal, he cuts out in the road, right. And he sees a car and he gets that like, oh shit, no this ain't good. You know, based on whatever experiences he's had or responses that he's witnessed from his mother. Okay. Or like some sort of like they kind of get tense there. They're gauging risk but just this thing steps in the road and just looks kind of like, Eh, like this look on his face and I'm anthropomorphizing here, but look on his face was like, no, what in the hell is that followed by utter lack of interest and just left. He's like, he looked, I don't know what that is. I can't see this bringing anything good to me. And then wandered off and it was one of the weird, like that's the only one I've seen. Look at that thing. They don't even look real man. I'm telling you what, they're freaky. They are so tall. Like how tall this thing is. Like this high man, so like two feet high just yet. Leggy though. Huge feat. Just a weird, you know, they're like snowshoe hare specialist man. They like to hunt snowshoe hares so it has big feet so they can get through snow. Quite a hunter gatherer. Snowshoe Hare special.

Speaker 1:          02:31:36       Well Cameron Hanes was telling me about bears that come out of hibernation and as they come out of hibernation is the same time where the Moose are stuck in the snow and that it's just start flying snow. And so the Moose are like plotting and these bears come out and they haven't eaten anything in months because they'd just been hibernating. But they see these moves and they can't help but kill them. So they just go on these rampages killing every moose they find and just leaving their carcasses because they can't really handle meat yet.

Speaker 2:          02:32:06       Yeah, no, I got it. They, but they, they like to have the opportunity, had their instincts. He's just cause one day come when they do come out, you know, they'll come out and eat grass for a while, he vegetation, but they do spend a lot of time, um, following that, they spent a lot of time looking for, you know, what we call winter kill, um, just scavenging carcasses they can find and then they hammer hammer fawns. And that's something people use in that realize about black bears is the high rates of like fawn mortality get from black bears on elk, moose, deer, you know, they don't like, it doesn't seem like they really go after the adults like healthy adults under normal circumstances, but they really find out that blackberry just turn up and hit calves and Fonz and the way that no one ever thought before they smelled that placenta. It's like to have this idea of them as being kind of like the kinder, gentler bear, you know. But there they'd know these spots, they turn up in these spots before things turn up there to drop Fonz, you know, the second mountain lion or third mountain line I ever saw a saw cut and through a bunch of elk calves and a calving area. And you can just imagine how much the thing like that can clean house. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:33:17       God Damn. When we were a bear hunting, I got to watch Barrett's fight. We watched a, a fucking no holds barred brawl between this female bear with her two cubs. Oh really? Hale who had come into the bait. They, she fucking went to war, man. The bears, the babies climbed up the trees. They were way the fuck up the trees. Like to the point where we were worried, one of them got real squirrely. He was like Kinda like upside down on the tree. Like he was way up there and they're really young and uh, the adults can't climb because they get too heavy. And this big male had come in and it was a big female. And first the baby's ran up the tree and the female took off. She left and then she was, she just thought about it. She so you know what? Fuck that. And she turned around and attacked him, turned around and challenged him and they both went up on their back legs and they were just going at it just

Speaker 2:          02:34:08       wow.

Speaker 1:          02:34:09       And we were sitting there on the ground because Cameron is fucking nuts. He likes to hunt on the ground. He looks at Boalt Hall, no Tree Stan. So we're just as like tree that's fallen and we're set up behind this tree and we're watching these fucking, you know, six, seven foot brown bears going to war right in front of us. I mean no more than 30 40 yards away.

Speaker 2:          02:34:29       Duke. Yeah. You gotta be wondering like in the middle of this fight, all sudden he comes rolling over and here's your ass sitting there. I was knocked up, man. I had an arrow knocked and you know, but like such a little kid, one of my earliest memory is earliest memories, but are being a little kid. And my dad got a phone call one night, one of his hunting buddies had, was sitting on a bear bait, what is bow? And a sal came in with cubs and smelled them and shooed her cubs up a tree. But they went up past him in the tree and then they started squealing and balling up there and she came up mauled his legs that he loved. Yeah, he went up in a hospital. Fuck. So she was a small enough that she could make it up the tray. She got, well, she's opened up to get at his boots.

Speaker 2:          02:35:14       But I mean, hey, you know, I mean most of though, I don't know. I, I've heard that that some blackbirds get too big to climb. I don't know. I mean they can climb pretty good. I mean, and I don't know to what extent, but I mean your typical barriers, you typical blackberry can get itself up a tree. She went up a tree, the one that we saw, she went up a tree a little bit, but only like maybe five or six feet were her kids went like they were 50 feet. I'm sure it depends a lot on this, your conference with the tree and whatnot, but for sure we have a grizzlies don't, I mean they when you're young, but when they get older they can't cut that tree.

Speaker 1:          02:35:46       Yeah, that's what they were saying they were because they had tree stands there, but he likes the Honda ground. But he said, if you see a Grizzly, then we go up the tree stand for sure. Yeah, there's a bunch right there. It was kind of like, that looks cute, but it was crazy to watch them Duke it out like right there in front of us. I mean it was white and went on for a while and then he would come back and she would chase him off again. And then finally he gave up. But then as it got darker, she took off and then a bunch of bears came in. When it's dark, that's when it's really crazy. Start calling. Alberta's flooded with bears, man. They said that there's between, depending on who you ask, between three and eight per acre, and they're dealing with 8,000 acre per square mile per square mile.

Speaker 1:          02:36:30       That's what I meant. And they're dealing with 8,000 square miles. So he said there's this bears everywhere. And so the first time I got there, you know, we, we sat down, we weighed him like, where are all these fucking bears? You know, if there's so many bears, like you think you would see one and then when you see one and then you see another and you don't hear him, that's what's crazy because the ground is thick with leaves and pine needles and stuff. So literally all sudden his parents are very, like, he's there looking at you, you know, from 70, 80 feet away, you know, just, you didn't even see him coming. Suddenly appears because it's so dense. So many trees up there.

Speaker 2:          02:37:04       I was calling turkeys one time and had a bear come behind me. Um, you know like predators when you're making, when you're calling turkeys in the spring, you're making head noises, track males, um, check with toms, but predators will come to that noise. And uh, I had a bear come in behind me that I never heard until I heard it breathe. It sounded like a dude and you're on the ground sitting right in underground and I here, I mean this thing was right. I mean right there like breathe or my shoulder. How many feet from oh five, six feet. I'm just there. When I turned I was scared but that thing was more scared when I turn, he like turned himself inside out. Man Just took off. It was amazing. It was funny. We were talking about like bears climbing trees, black bears and grizzly bears.

Speaker 2:          02:37:58       Um, I wrote about this at some point, but we are, my brother and I were laying on this ridge one time hunting elk and like during the mid day when it's warm, like nothing happens, you know, we'll just go sleep somewhere and wait for the elk come back out cause they go into black timber just to feed bed down. So there's really no sense and there's nothing you can do. You just sleep. And at one point I wake up cause I hear a noise and I wake up and was a black bear standing there and he goes off down this ridge line and I'm sorry it just goes down off the ridge down toward the valley floor. That night we headed out to go hunt. Uh, we headed out to go hunt elk and we happened to go in the direction that the bird went and my brother's still had a bear tag.

Speaker 2:          02:38:39       I had filled my bear but he still had a bear tag. And as we're walking, I hear the noise of its claws on the bark like real loud, you know like barks, phone and scratch, you know you manage like what a cat would sound like or something. Scratching up something. I'm like that must be that black bear. So we go hauling ass up to tree thinking that will maybe get the bear up the tree and bill check it out but run it. There is not a black bear. It's a sow grizzly standing there and she's got two cubs that are about four or five feet up this tree and she's standing there at the base of the tree and she woofs that. It was like a dog like oof barking, you know and those cubs come down the tree and we're just standing right there man.

Speaker 2:          02:39:24       It was like you can't, you can never say it was close to getting scratched unless you got scratched cause you don't know what's in the animal's head. But like reviewing it in my head, that was one that was like a very sketchy moment, you know as that bear kind of like, cause it's like the last thing you're supposed to do. Right. It's like mess with their cubs and here we are just running up on there and when she got those cubs down the tree and they started going up the hill away from us, she was taking her paw and moving the cubs with her. Paul. Wow. Pushing them ahead of her. Wow. It's the same way like you know when you'd like trying to get your kids to go, we want you, I saw your hand up guys. I got your hand on their head or yeah. It's about trying to guide him. You know why she's like giggling and giggling. Wow. That was wild man. But she could have spun around to scratch those things. That's the big reason why a lot of people are hikers get attacked. Right? It's a female with their costs coming

Speaker 4:          02:40:14       across something. Yeah. Like this blew my mind. I just read that not a single bow hunter has been killed by a grizzly bear. You know, while bow hunting, even though boners get scratched up all the time, like every year there's some guy getting scratched up now, the single bow hunters, men killed by a grizzly bear and at least 20 years. Wow. You know, last year there was like three grizzly bear fatalities in Montana, Wyoming. Well, that was one of the things you saw on that hunt show was how difficult it is to bow hunt for grizzlies because they, first of all, the Kodiak island was very windy. Like these guys were like, they were taking shots in the air would just take off and missed the [inaudible]. This is miserable and wet. You got to get so close with, oh man. It's one thing like being a stand and waiting for a white tail to walk underneath you, but to creep up on a fucking giant nine foot bear that's outside. You got to get within 30 40 yards of this thing. Don't get an accurate shot on it and it's windy and everything there. But now in that show,

Speaker 2:          02:41:13       they're doing that. This happens a lot, but I know that like

Speaker 4:          02:41:17       shows don't show it.

Speaker 2:          02:41:21       And outdoor writers don't write about it, but oftentimes, very often, I can't say it's the majority of time. I was like a very common practice when a guy's bow hunting brown bears is the minute

Speaker 4:          02:41:34       that Arrow makes contact with that bear. The guides lightened it up with like a three 75 h and h. So there's shooting with a gun right after the minute that arrowhead. Yeah, that's probably smart. I mean, I saw that on a show. It was a, a bow hunting show with this guy shot a fucking elephant with a bow and the elephant turn and you're like, fuck you. And elephants starts running it and boom, they shot him in the head with a rifle and like he's going to call that I hunted an elephant with a bow. Like the fuck you did. All you did was pissing elephant off and it charged you and these guides shot the elephant in the head. They killed the elephant.

Speaker 2:          02:42:12       Yeah, I'm not, I'm not diminishing the balls it takes to get in there. Like I watch the thing like, you know, I watched thing where uh, Tom Miranda, you know, kills like a big grizzly was Bo and by no, I mean by any means. Like he, it was like he got a great hit on that bear that bear ran and fell over. I'm not saying that's what I was saying. You hear about it so off, when you talk to guide so often and even do with rifles, even we've got hits it with a rifle. He's going to start pumping. Led. Yeah. It's just so hard to anchor them in and then they go on those orders and you don't want to lose them. So don't want to go in there after him.

Speaker 4:          02:42:44       Take the initial shot, they consider you shot that bear and then everybody else in the guy, you know, or whoever can can do a follower really didn't like watching them shoot the elephant. There's something to me about shooting some animals where it's like, I don't get it. Like why would, I don't know why you would travel all the way to Africa to shoot an elephant with a bow while these people behind you. Rifle it and you're calling that bow hunting. I wouldn't shoot it. I don't, I couldn't shoot an elephant just because I like, I don't

Speaker 2:          02:43:12       have, I didn't, I don't have like a, a context with the animal, a cultural context, you know what I'm saying? Like with North American animals, I find that generally when I go hunting and I'd like to have had an experience with it and understand sort of you don't understand it. And it would be for African hunting for me to like enjoy it on Africa. I would probably want to go there just to have a look around and be there and then maybe go again just for me personally, then go again. And I might enjoy hunting more. Once I sort of felt like I understood the animals, you know, or I understood more about the biology and the sort of like, I just understood the area better. It would make me feel more like, like, uh, like, uh, like to what I want to have in a, in a Predator prey relationship.

Speaker 2:          02:43:58       We're going down to film this year. Uh, we're going down to Bolivia and we'll go out hunting with Amerindians or go along on a hunt with Amerindians and, um, you know, they, they go out and do meet hunts for Cathy. Borrow Pako they both fish for fish a lot. One of the things they like to hunt is he liked to hunt spider monkeys, you know, and I've always valid, I'll never eat a monkey. You know, I, I always say that I'll never read monkey, but now I'm going to be down there and he's guys, you know, presumably they're going to get a monkey and they're going to cook it and you gotta try it. I can't decide, man. Yeah, I'm not in the eating primates. I just feel like, you know, I can't decide what I'll do when I'm sitting there dogs and didn't like it at all.

Speaker 2:          02:44:43       Well, you ate a coyote, which is crazy. Then they'd be like, that didn't bother me. And like an emotional way. But I'm saying I tripped out emotionally about eating a dog, so I can't imagine what I might suffer to be chewing up a prime primate. It's just like, I remember reading one time and this kind of, I was this, explain this to my brother the other day when I was talking about this conundrum I'm in, where I was reading about a guy who was the screen he was describing the hunt from monkeys and a dude hit a, and he was observing, he was observing south, you know, South American tribal hunters or Amerindians. He's observing them hunting monkeys. And the monkey got shot in the back and a monkey with a dart and the monkey reached around and grabbed the dark. Whoa. So they image it was just so burned my head.

Speaker 2:          02:45:37       But I think like, I don't know what I'll do, man. I'll be curious. I'd be curious if the guys I work with, if they want to eat the monkey or not. Yeah. But there's so many weird things. He'd go like this. So these guys are indigenous hunters. They hunt, they make their own bowls, they live in the jungle. Like any kind of thing, like if you went out and surveyed a hundred Americans, a hundred would say like, by all means, if anyone can justify hunting to be these boys, all right. Um, they're going to be their hunting, whether you're with them or not. So it was kind of like, you look at, well, monkeys dead now. Yeah. I guess

Speaker 1:          02:46:10       I could see that. What I couldn't see as going there with a purpose to go shoot a monkey, I guess if I was there experiencing what it is like for them. And also if they offered me a mom, like it was part of like you're, you're taking into their home and they're cooking you a meal and they ask you, you know, they serve you what they eat, maybe then I would,

Speaker 2:          02:46:30       no, there's no way I shoot. There's no way I'd shoot a monkey. Yeah. By saying that, I don't think that one shouldn't be allowed and whatever, you know, it just depends on the, the consensus of biologists and whatever area, whether it can warn and or not. But no, I wouldn't, it just like I couldn't, yeah, I couldn't either. But I know that they have issues with baboons and people. Dude in Africa, I, it's just like, I guess I can't get it. But in Africa you get the sense that people view like baboons, almost like how you might like a, I hate to say it, almost like you'd might look at like raccoons and opossums that are getting into your dumpster. Yes. But

Speaker 1:          02:47:08       they, they'll kill a baby. Oh, kill a human that are stolen human. The first thing about Cameron Hanes, who just got back from Africa, he shot a fucking baboo, went over there, shut up abdomen with a bow and arrow. And I'm like, why don't you shoot a baboons? And he's like, they actually

Speaker 2:          02:47:21       courage you to shoot them the baboons as possible. Cause they're overpopulated and they're really dangerous. That's a friends of mine told me, man, do, uh, do the guys in Africa eat the baboons? No, they don't need it. Baboons. And they don't need to hygienists and they don't like the high end.

Speaker 1:          02:47:33       No, they killed him. They killed him whenever they can because they're so overpopulated, but they don't eat them. But he ate a kudu. He shot a kudu over there and eat that and he said it was amazing.

Speaker 2:          02:47:42       Yeah, said Kudu. Kudos. Like similar I guess in a lot of ways to deer, elk and a, the way it tastes. The word overpopulated, just such a weird word. It's such an abused works. Whenever I hear that always get be like according to whose perspective because again and again and we're telling like deer overpopulated like, yeah, I mean from the perspective of some agricultural interests, dear overpopulated from the perspective of auto insurers, you know, deer over populated from the perspective of Lyme disease activists, you know, deer over pilot, but from a perspective of dude who likes to eat a lot of deer, you might be like, now's the good old days, man. It's like this is perfect. If I lived in some areas,

Speaker 1:          02:48:22       Mary's a western Massachusetts that are so flooded with Deere, I would definitely have one of those crazy bumpers on my truck. You know, they have those crazy big steel. Well they make them specifically for deer to withstand a deer hit. Yeah. There was one of them that they were pulling up photos over the other day of 18 wheelers that they have these giant ones they put over the front of their trucks because deer, you know, are so common and in a lot of these areas where they're transporting stuff and they had one where this deer, it just, it had hit it and the, the guard did its job but the fucking entire truck was just painted with blood, you know, cause it was all 65 miles an hour and you hit an animal. It's basically a bag of them.

Speaker 2:          02:49:00       It vaporize, vaporize them such a disturbing way. I recently wrote a thing about this on the, on the mediator show website where I was about these recent controversies where someone will go and kill a African animal. You know, I can like a lot of those pictures by the way, tell people where they can get that because I loved your perspective on it and I loved one of the things you pointed out about, you've seen all these things where people are getting pissed off. These pretty girls that are going over there and shooting these animals and a lot of it is sexism. Oh yeah man. It pit for a girl to go to African hunt, pisses off people way more than for a dude to and also for a wealthy person hunt in Africa pisses off way more people than the middle class person hunting in Africa, which is just weird.

Speaker 2:          02:49:42       Like you know it, it's so beyond the biology is just like weird sexual stuff. It's weird. Nv class envy, however you want to think of like whatever you want to determine about the legitimacy of hunting. And Africa's really have nothing to do with the gender of the hunter. Yeah. But this, this one point I tried to make an it thing that I wrote. You could, you could find if you just go on, you could probably even type in like, uh, Steven Rinella African hunting controversy or go to the, to the meat eater.com you'll find the article. But, but a point I make is when people look at someone posing with an African animal, like a lion, they, they, I think people look at and they feel like they see a dead movie star because they don't know like all you know of that animal is sort of wildlife documentaries and then cartoon versions and the Lion King.

Speaker 2:          02:50:40       It's like, you feel like you're looking at that. But in America we drive down the road and we see just like contorted pulverized deer carcasses. Yeah. You can't escape it. Yes. Yeah. And so I feel like it's never going to be as offensive. You know, w when someone sees a dead deer, it's not as shocking to them is be like, it's the animal from the movies and then killed it. You know, anthropomorphizing of an animal. It's a real issue when it comes really feels the people more like, I remember a friend of mine who worked in the environmental movement, or I shouldn't say that, cause I, she was a conservationist. Okay. As you were in the conservation movement and she complained about, um, half jokingly about charismatic megafauna so that so much mental energy of Americans gets tied up in the preservation of charismatic megafauna and those things become such money sinks that we miss

Speaker 2:          02:51:41       opportunities to understand like this vast suite of other creatures out there that doesn't make it onto calendars. And she was, if I remember, I think she was speaking of the amount of research, dollar dollars and public interests and things that go into wolves like understanding wolves, you know, and there's all the other animals that she calls like non charismatic megaphone, you just can't get someone to like care about them, you know? And I think that's, that's one as far as conservation goes, I think that's one thing that that conservation organizations that are based off of specific animals wise tie is that they're looking at like apex or keystone cornerstone species. So like a group like the National Wild Turkey Federation and the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, they will point out, they'll be like, yeah, this is about elk. We have elk on our symbol. You might think that we fetishize l but I can tell you this, what's good for elk is good for everybody.

Speaker 2:          02:52:36       Yeah. You know, it's one of the most demanding, like least tolerant things. And so if you preserve elk wintering habitat, you're also at the same time preserving the habitats and so many other species. And you might not say the same thing about if you went and preserve the habitat of, you know, some animal, the more restricted home range or something, it might not blossom outward to offer protection for all these other things. So that's one way in which like the charismatic megafauna thing winds up playing out is people go like, yeah, but by helping him, I'm helping everybody. So I'd like to have something for my calendar. People have that aversion to a trophy hunting. That's one of the other things that drives people nuts about Africa. Is it people going over there for blood loss, they're going over there just to kill. They want to stuff it and put on their wall, this beautiful animal that should just be observed and appreciate it for what it is.

Speaker 2:          02:53:28       Yeah. I, that's something that I struggle with an earlier I made a turn about something being like a, like, like a semantics thing. Because if you go in hunt and you keep something like you have right here in your studio, you have a uh, a deer antler, you gotta like a deer skull, right? By really any definition you'd say like you'd be like, well that's a hunting trophy, you know? Does that make you then a hunting trip like a trophy hunter, even though you ate the deer to be a non trophy hunter, would that mean that you should have thrown that deer head in the garbage in order to be more peer? Or is it more peer that you'd have that you'd maintain that emblem and pay respect to the animal in perpetuity by having its head here. So it's like you kept a trophy, you kept the meat and kept the trophy.

Speaker 2:          02:54:15       But when people hear trophy hunter, I think what the, what that means in our culture is that someone that just hunts for that purpose, like he just wants to go kill that thing. And this comes from guys never hunted in Africa, but so much of the controversy about Africa is that people are going there and killing animals just for the head and bringing them home. And that way you're probably trivialized and you experience, but you're also not really looking at the broad picture of how game gets managed there and the importance that the commodification of wildlife plays in Africa. Where here we have public owned, publicly owned wildlife, you know, so and we have a really strident system where stringent system where we can protect legally protect stuff. But in Africa there's a great argument to be made for. If it wasn't for the value of those animals to Westerners, if it wasn't for the hunting industry, those animals wouldn't be in those places where they are.

Speaker 2:          02:55:09       Yeah, they have those animals that way too many forces and factors that would lead to those being like ravaged ecosystems from hunting from people, I mean hunting farm, people who are starving or who are wanting to graze livestock in those areas. And the fact that you bring in a currency and you monetize them enables people to preserve these large tracks of land and have animals on there. So you can look at like, what is Joe Blow's motivation? Joe Blow's motivation might be, he thinks it'd be sweet to have a zebra hide on his floor and you can condemn Joe blow for thinking that. But you really, to be fair, you have to look at the impact that, that money that he spent to get it has on the broader economy and on the wildlife politics of that place. So it's way more complicated than what anyone individual's motivations were.

Speaker 2:          02:56:06       You know? And it's just, I just caution people and I, and I, I'll tell you what, I've had my share of looking at pictures of guys hunting an African and being like, dude, you just went out and paid someone and he showed you that and you're like, well, that's what one of those is in shot it. I've felt that a thousand times looking at those pictures. But it's one of those things that the more I've learned about it and spoke to people who've gone there and, and read about it, the more I've come to admit that you know what, what's going on in Africa is vastly more complicated than what you're going to get from reading about Internet controversies that people posting pictures. You really need to study up on that stuff before you condemn it because I think you'll be, you'll be kind of shocked by some of the stuff

Speaker 4:          02:56:46       if anybody's interested in it further. We're just about out of time. But Louie thorough has a documentary through, how do you say his stand through, through Louis through has a documentary about a African hunting camps were kind of goes into great detail with these guys that run these camps about how these animals, they essentially wouldn't be there if it wasn't, they would be extinct and we were on, we were at a time. Okay. Um, all right dude, uh, your book, you've got the buffalo books published. Oh No. You know what my first book,
