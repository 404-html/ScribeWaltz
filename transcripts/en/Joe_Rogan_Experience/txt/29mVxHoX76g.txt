Speaker 1:          00:00:00       I'll never forget. Five, four, three, two, one. Yes. How the fuck is it? Been so many years and you haven't been on here. This is ridiculous timing, everything. There's times you go super busy and you too. It's really good seeing yet fucking awesome seeing you, man. It's really awesome seeing, yeah, this is a weird thing because we're having this conversation and people are listening to it, but at the same time, uh, you know, you're one of my favorite people and I'm fucking known you forever. We were friends when we were both hungry, scrappy young comedians with no idea what the fuck was going to happen. Right know. And we were both like, Whoa, Whoa, what the fuck is going to happen in the future? Well, you know what that's like, there's a bond that you have with people that like you and I were essentially in the same place and are in our lives in the same place, our comedy careers at the same time.

Speaker 2:          00:00:52       And you know, I tell everyone I remember what I, what I liked about you, how real and honest you were. You were. And you were also like, oh, you want to do is play pool, which I didn't know shit about pool and I can't. It's all right. It's all right. We got to play pool and I would sock and I can tell you get bored real quick and then you'd have it. You go to a pool halls and you'd fucking work out. Did you want to go to the gym? Like all right, we'll go to the gym, but you beat up like an hour and a half and I got to say is, I watched your whole career grow and grow and grow. I can tell when the fighting came along the UFC and my, am I wrong to say you probably were the happiest. That was not the greatest job ever. It was because you never changed all you all. I knew you as a tough guy. Honest guy played billiards, worked out. I've heard you say, dude, I'll fucking choke you out right now. These guys were at a craft table for a Disney show, which, which shows us what was the

Speaker 1:          00:01:57       baseball show? Oh, hardball. That's right, dude, you are the fucking pioneer. Harven Dude, I have a photo of us, a monkey. I have a photo of us that I have to bring in. I have to bring it in because I got, fuck, I've got to find no exact where I put it. I don't have to find a no exact, it's you and me from like 1993 we look like babies are babies. We look like babies and with Ruthann remember the agent? Yes dude dude, that was a funny role. That was a, that was one of my favorite examples of a show that could have been a really funny show written by really funny guys and the network's juice all over it. They just stuck their own. This is my now and they ruined it. Ruined it did. But you get, you were there at the pilot,

Speaker 2:          00:02:51       you're on the, you're on the craft line. Craft services, which to me that was the greatest party. Even filming anything. I was still, I was still, this is free, go like guts. So there was a guy, young fucking little guy, just, he probably wants to be an actor, but he's serving rice to us and he said he has a shirt, says I love karate and you're just fucking, is it? Here come, you're fucking, you're all hot tub. And he got to dig. You take karate and the kid goes your yet get off. I, I don't know why. I don't know if it's said kickbox and whatever. He said, I'd fucking crazy socks. It's the fucking worst. Didn't know what, there's no way. You're not mischaracterizing this conversation. No, it does. No way it happened like that. Like I just walked up till God deal rice.

Speaker 2:          00:03:41       It's like, dude, karate socks. No, no, no. He had his shirt Kinda Kreidie shirt and that was enough. None of it. You started poking questions for him. You were like asking is teligent you like, hey man, what's you, uh, Eh, we'll get you into karate. And then he would go something like, you know, I like the martial arts. And then you would say, dude, you should take this. He was like, no, I think karate guy would win it. And then I saw you just like, dude, I'm telling you right now, fucking crush it. But the point of that conversation was I couldn't, I just never saw anyone like you and my life. I, you're like a fucking that moment we go, the sky is so he's an he didn't you? You were fearless. I'd never seen anyone so fearless in my life and I've always looked up to you for that bag. I definitely never been fearless. I'm not a feel of the person just took that. Oh No, no, no, no, no, no. Not at all. I'm fucking around. But I've never been fearless. I'm scared of everything. But this is how you, uh, how you respond to it. It's how you respond to fear whether or not you're scared of some of the unknown. Most people shy away from the unknown, you know?

Speaker 3:          00:04:58       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:04:59       That is very true. But it's hard to get honest because sometimes there's a lot of deeper factors in is a lot of eyes on you. You don't think your kids are eyes are on you, you to expose him to stuff. So it's a little like, um, I'm a feared to be, I fear being aleut too honest at times. Right. I see what you're saying, Byron off. That's right or wrong. Right. I know. Look, you kind of protecting yourself or your kids in a, in a lot of ways from how you are, because you don't want them to kind of be as wild and crazy as you were when you were young. Like with the pot thing and stuff like that. Well, like here, let me ask you this. Okay. If you're, let's see how old your you have. How old? $3. Okay. I have three doors. If one door to goes and you could tell they're starting to kind of get into pot. They want to grow faster. Why do you want to let them, don't you think you were doing it when you were like 14? Yeah. 14 now I'm going to say seven.

Speaker 1:          00:05:59       Tina's, I was a late bloomer, so I got into it a little bit with some friends when I was like 12 and 13 yeah, we got some pot. Well, yeah. Wow. Yeah. But I didn't get it. And that's my middle daughter. Yeah. It happens to do you leave them alone, leave those little fuckers alone. They get ahold of some music. That's what it is, man. You know, with us, we would, uh, we would go over this fucking dude's house and we'd listened to bad company and we'd, uh, we'd get some pot.

Speaker 2:          00:06:31       See the, I was still into sports at that time, but so when I discovered it,

Speaker 3:          00:06:38       okay,

Speaker 2:          00:06:38       I was into the metal, right. So we would go in the basement and we turn on and bornite when I heard, when I heard, and I dunno if that's another weird part of me, why was I attracted to that? I heard them, I heard that fast, furious. And that made me ape shit. It's great for a young guy,

Speaker 1:          00:06:58       for a young guy that's the music that sort of represents your hormones.

Speaker 2:          00:07:02       You know, John got out,

Speaker 1:          00:07:08       you know, you're fucking 17. You're like, yeah, you know, and, and also your suppressed all the time. Like everyone's like, calm down, settle down, not so loud. Right. Stop fucking each other. Hold on. And then some music comes up and it just, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:07:26       it releases all that madness. Yeah. It comes out. You feel it, you feel the music understands you. I know. But I fear, here's my biggest fear as a dad getting addicted to shit. Yeah. And get pregnant. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:07:43       While those things are both, uh, the reality is that everybody faces when you're young, you know, and, and also biologically everybody faces it seems like with pills. I know so many people that have gotten addicted to pills. I mean, it's an epidemic. I'm, no, I'm known if I had a sit down and have all the people that I've been close enough to to call on a regular base and say, how you doing? What's going on? You know, have conversation with them. Yeah. Maybe a dozen have been hooked on pills and I know three people that have died from it.

Speaker 2:          00:08:13       Well, there weren't, I don't remember pills and weird

Speaker 1:          00:08:17       kids did it. They didn't happen. They didn't exist at all. You would hear like, some people get in like vicodins and shit like that, but those were always like crazy people. Don't you think kind of though

Speaker 2:          00:08:30       it's, they're all prescription pills, right? Yeah, yeah. No, yeah, no, absolutely. Definitely. Right. Definitely. Right. So if they're prescribed, does it seem as like, oh, they figured out how to legalize really bad trucks down? Well, they definitely did. They figured out a build trust does more because we'll wear these white lab coats and we had to tell them and we write out the little card and just take three of these a week

Speaker 1:          00:08:58       and be able to stop. That's another suppressed guy. But that guy listened to some death metal from feminine, you know, let me get this fucking car after selling heroin all day with a lab coat on, that's a dark. There was an article about this one. It's insane. There was an article about this one family that has a, um, has like a giant steak in that market and they've made billions and billions of dollars and it was breaking down like how much money they made and how many people are hooked on it, how many prescriptions there are. It's like they're just, they're drug dealers like the legalized. Well if you looked at this in the future, like when they look back and they say, oh, remember those opium dens and the cowboys had remembered from Wyatt earp, was it wider wild bill Hickok one of them fucking movies. They went to the opium den that Chinese people got them all fucked up on opium and we were like, Whoa, those are dark times. This is way worse than that. I agree. And it's happening underneath our noses.

Speaker 1:          00:10:04       Look, don't you see? How do you stop that? That's a good question. Cause you can talk about it forever. And I think, I think you've talked about enough. I even brought up to people and it's, it's sort of the old again. You face it. What do you do now? We can talk about it forever, but what do you actually do? Teachers just talk about it and let people live seep into people and he think he's telling the truth or you think they know what they're saying? Dude. That why things decide for themselves. Any, um, anything that you're going to let your kid figure out for themselves. You're like depriving them of information. Right? So I think what you gotta do is be like really honest about it. And I'm with my oldest daughter, the young girls don't know that I smoked the weed, but we just had conversations about it.

Speaker 1:          00:10:48       I said, listen, there are some things that are dangerous and there are some things that are just not dangerous at all. And pod is the one that's not dangerous at all. Like my, my wife and I had a conversation with her about it and you know, it's a weird sort of a conversation cause you're, you're talking to someone who on the verge of being an adult, right? So you're kind of bullshitting them still but not really course. Whereas if they were an adult you'd be like, Look Pot's not hurting anybody. I smoked pot before I go to bed. I do too. And then everybody would laugh. Hahaha. You know, from here on, I like it right before her. I'm sorry. And then you know, you have these little conversations with people with, with adults, but when the kid that about th that come in and don't, don't, don't tell him. Right. You want to keep somehow or another this innocuous thing from the kids. But meanwhile you'll sip a glass of wine in front of him. I'll drink a glass of wine from my kids all the time. I've let them try wine. I've let him try a sip of wine and try this gas tank and then it becomes a funny thing they talk about, remember that time I tried to wine? Oh my God. So grabs. But it's socially accepted. Yeah. To let them taste how disgusting adults tasting beverages are. But, but smoking pot in

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       front of them or around them would be horrific. It's so foolish sheets, you know? Did you know anyone? I remember I knew a kid and he was up the street and he smoked pot when his parents and his salmon, we're going to go in there and smoke pot when the parents, but my initial, I don't know, my, my instinct was like, oh, that's weird. It's just weird. I can't hit it. That's weird. I guess it is, but I don't know. You know? I mean, it's not really, if, if having a drink with your dad's not weird, how come you can't, having a beer with your dad is not weird. I'll give you for instance. Okay, sorry. My Dad, he, he never drank with me. He never said, but he was, everyone else would say, sky's fucking like brewers. You're dead. This guy's nuts. Like my father's nuts.

Speaker 2:          00:12:45       I didn't see that side of him at all. So not until it was my 21st birthday. Like I just knew him as his fucking Dad, right? World War Two vet and shit like that. Serious guy. Very serious. Never left. And I think he left twice the filthy or the funny and his laugh was just like, that was, that was killing him that you fucking corona. So I swear to God. So, um, when I was 21, he said, let's go have a beer. You're a man now. So we went to his place, swamp water, als when I was in Florida and one out and have a couple of beers. He's saying some ca he doesn't talk, he'll say stupid jokes and I don't really understand. I'm bored. I go outside, catch a buzz and we got this will help the fucking night I come back and catch a buzz means smoke a little weed.

Speaker 2:          00:13:46       Yes. I come back in. Um, and he's, there's a crowd around him and I swear to God because he was older, I thought he, I thought he was down. Everyone was looking at the old man up for it. Go there and he's fucking holding court with the whole bar and he's, he's killing, he's destroying. And so then I turned around like, who is this fucking guy? I want to hire him. He's fucking hilarious. And I just couldn't understand. I never saw this man. So I had a beer, he had a beer, we caught buses and we had the phone. I never saw, my father was funny and I said, where, why didn't, why didn't you show me this side earlier? I would hear this from all my friends. He goes, you weren't fucking ready. That's hilarious. But I kind of feel that way with certain kids. Do you know what I mean? For me. This fucker, like for instance, I can say, I think, I think this kid, you know what if they, if they go in that direction,

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       I think they'll be okay. This one, it's not so much donut. It's this one against stop. Yeah. They do have different personalities like that, right? Yeah. And you've seen like, it's, it's almost like a, I'm gonna let you out of the fence. Don't listen. Don't go pass f fucking tree during the woods. Walker went nowhere did I not say don't go into fuck it. He's in the woods and then they come back. Oh I'm sorry. It's, yeah, I fear this one's going to go some kids freedom is super intoxicating. You got to wonder what it is. Is it anything that we set up in those kids when they were young? Did we suppress him too much? And so they just had this intense desire to be free. Cause I think there's something to that. This, this desire to protect someone. It kind of backfires when you're raising kids in some ways because if you try to protect him too much, then they, they resent you.

Speaker 1:          00:15:50       And then they, they pushed back the other way. That's why I like girls who have like really strict parents when it comes to sex were always like the biggest freaks. Like we all knew that right? Catholic school girls worth the biggest freaks of all time. It wasn't even close. It was well it was that or like a broken home, you know, no one's around, you know, I, Hey Daddy, well the zone, any negative pressure, right? Any negative comes out in one way or another. My coming out like you and humor or might come out of anger. It might come out in addiction, but any negative pressure that you experienced as a child, whether it's bullying, uh, you know, going to a new neighborhood, parents break up no attention, you know, alcoholism in the family, whatever the fuck it is, it just finds its way to the sun.

Speaker 1:          00:16:45       You know, your rights. That's where all our music comes from. I mean, that's where all the best stuff comes from. It comes from some kind of pain, some, some kind of like need to never feel that pain again, need to celebrate the happiness of life. Because you felt that pain and you understand it and right. Isn't that what knowing? How am I? No, no, no. But you try to tense. When did it start with you? Like once the first time where you saw something and went, oh my God, whoa. With kids. Yeah, from the jump dude. Just from the jump. Just from the time they were little tiny babies, just start looking at him and he'd go to these, this is a little calculating beings. This isn't simply a baby. Like we have these narrow classifications for human beings. Like, oh, he's an old man. He wouldn't try to fuck her, you know? Or He's a, you know, he's a young kid. He doesn't understand. No, they fucking understand. They understand. They just don't have all the words yet. They understand a lot more than you think they do and they're just constantly calculating. They're constantly taking data. They're learning

Speaker 4:          00:17:50       and we're still doing it, man. I mean, you and I are better at talking now in our forties and we were in our twenties you chest, you just brought back. I feel like I just went to therapy. Does the basic, I just found where my anger came while you were talking, I was getting visual flashbacks of where it really started. My sister, I remember my sister got, um, horrible divorce harvest harvest, really strict. She was getting hit. Oh right. So I just remember mom, my mom getting those phone calls and blah, blah blah, and did it. So no, it's not funny. But, so I remember going there, we'd go in the middle of night, get there and you know, she'd be bruised. You could tell she was hit, which is already, you're fucking traumatized. You're seven, eight years old and you just, you witnessed the violence. And then, um, I remember the fucker came at the house, didn't know we were there.

Speaker 4:          00:18:53       And my dad was like, hey man, why don't you be a man, be a man. And he said, if you earn all, man, I fucking make you eat them words. I remember my father going, your dad, and he's trying to get out in my mind, it's like, God, fuck it, and please, please. But I remember that anger and then I, that's how I discovered fucking metallica. Whoa. From that, that exchange, that aggression. I needed something. I would go in my basement tear shit. And so how old, how old are you at the time? I tell him off, I've tended, I was 14 like do you know what? I used to have a lot of internal arguments like I should have said I would have is I should have said they would go on for hours. I'd be in my fucking car and traffic. Yo You, if you fucking thought about it, this word, you know like you don't come come up with some better thing that you could have said or some some slicker thing that you could have said.

Speaker 4:          00:19:56       Well I did. I still do that though. You still gave up on it. I forced it out. We'd it like it's a weed in the garden. No, I'll do it for a good half hour bathroom on the road. Are you kidding me? Try not to man. I try not to. I try to, as much as I can focus my thoughts on things that are actually beneficial to me. So like if it's something like that where I know what it is, I know what it is, so I ran into some fucking idiot. I know what it is. I'm not going to dwell on it. Right. You know what I mean? Just I'm going to move by instead of like making that a part of my life. I don't want to anybody's goofy behavior to be a part of my life. It's so exhausting. It's exhausting and it's not necessary. You could figure out a way. It's an exercise. It's not easy to do, but when you get frustrated by someone, you got to learn how to just concentrate and things that you want to concentrate. Just don't let the other

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       things in. And then after a while you get stronger at it. It's like a weight or it's like a muscle. Rather you lift weights with it, it gets stronger. So like putting your intention on things that you actually enjoy instead of festering on some fucking stupid argument you might've had with your girlfriend two months ago or with your boss last week, or retard in twitter or someone on twitter. Yeah. Or someone you ran into the gas station and said something fucking stupid you for no reason and you said I should have fucking smack that guy. You know, you just close it up because you just, you, yeah. She can't let, we can't let those things grow. That's what it is. When you feed them, they grow, they do grow and then it goes easier for them to grow. It's almost like they've set the fucking seeds.

Speaker 1:          00:21:36       A matrix of seeds in your head or any other retarded thought would just fucking sprout wings and fly away real quick and don't let them. It happens to most to when you're, when you're growing like as a person every time. Every time I think I'm growing like, wow, I'm expanding in life to bring him down. Show him his weakness. Yeah. Say he can handle twitter. That's what happens to me. I'll get a fucking tweet from, I don't know who this person is. I don't care who this person is. I can hear it. It took me a little while to get over that. You know what, man? I don't blame them. I used to blame them and I still make fun of them, but I think it's a t, it's a tool. Twitter is that is too weird and tiered to, and it's never been, it's never existed before.

Speaker 1:          00:22:24       There's never been this ability with an anonymous name to just be shitty to someone or just communicate with someone or even have any kind of contact with someone positive or negative because I think there's a lot of people out there that are addicted to the positive too. I mean like girls, girls on instagram that had taken yoga, booty pictures and by the way, don't stop. I'm not saying stop. I'm not saying stop. All of a sudden. Just balance it out. Those pictures are wonderful. Keep them common girls. I'm not saying don't, don't take pictures of your well sculpted, but you should enjoy the praise that you get from your Labor in the gym. Not saying that, but I think definitely people they get that becomes addictive to them. They start gravitating towards it. Of course they do. It's like war of the, it's a war of the mines.

Speaker 1:          00:23:08       Mines all coupon, 20 to fourth episode conspiracy. It's a conspiracy. Is that what a conspiracy. Imagine if they'd created twitter because they knew. They were like, look, we have to figure out where to control people in the age of information. Well, here's the thing. Let them just communicate with each other freely. They'll start so much conflict. I'll never be able to deal with us taking over the world every time they get along. Just tear the pot just a little bit. Send the fun. Yeah, let's keep, keep race relations and check. Everything's always going to be chaos. Show them someone getting beaten by an office out immediately and you have that tape from 1980 I supposed it up. Make it look like today. Send

Speaker 4:          00:23:46       the funder time gang to dad and dad had died. I can introduce some new phrases to get them upset that me nothing. I think I'd like to see a debate. Well, surely my crowd is angry than yours. Really? Let's have a bottle off. Let's limit the words they're allowed to say freely. We need more restricted words. How about retard? That's an easy one to stop. Let's get rid of retard. I always wish repulsed by retaught. You know what? I've always found tranny to be quite offensive. Let's make training on the list as well. Then I'm going to go forward, but pushing too hard. They're going to push back. Oh, they'll forget to meet Lee. Oh really? Quick race walk. Why don't we pass a bill on trend candace and put it in the limelight because we all know everybody talks about that every day. You know what? We can never resolve gay marriage. We need it. It's not peace. We must move it. Don't lose the queen. You lose the queen. You lose the game. That's our, Jake matches our queen chess table of a social construct. What? I was a little kid,

Speaker 1:          00:24:56       we argued about gay marriage. When I moved from San Francisco to Florida. I was probably like, I think I was 11 years old and I remember that was a big thing that people were upset. They were trying to make gay marriage then, so that was like 1970 something. There's still arguing about it.

Speaker 4:          00:25:10       It's the same cycles every and nobody, nobody, nobody sees it. It's weird. It's crazy. I got to tell you, you don't. You get every four years the same thing. Here's, here's the debates. Gay, gay marriage, abortion. Abortion is a big one on a

Speaker 1:          00:25:29       portion stick. Trump. How do you feel about killing babies? Are we cool with it? As long as I don't want, sorry, I don't get to see it. Oh No, no, no. You don't say shit. We put a vacuum cleaner up there. There's nothing between you and the tissue at all. You don't see anything. Okay, cool. As long as I don't see it. Well, how big do they get? How big do they get before they suck them out of there? Yeah, they can get pretty big. Don't he wants to have this conversation. Nobody wants coming inside. People feel so good that nobody wants to have this conversation. Everyone's like, let's, let's just keep it around. Just keep it around, stop describing it and the uncomfortable way, that's like I'm describing it. It is like fucking mellow and bland and factual way as possible and it's uncomfortable.

Speaker 1:          00:26:22       It's fuck like what abortion actually is and I'm not saying that you shouldn't be able to do it. I'm a hundred percent pro choice. I'm 100% a woman has a right to do whatever she wants with her body and I definitely don't think a man should be able to tell you what to do with your body. 100% but the end of the day, that's a little baby and you're using a vacuum to suck it out of your body. Like it's odd, but it, but it's not odd. It's not like a judgment because I agree with it. I think he should be able to do it. But isn't there an up to a point because it's like, it's like three cells, like it was enough cells to fit on the very tip of a pin and it just gets sucked out of the vacuum. Okay. I don't really see the issue.

Speaker 2:          00:26:59       You know, if you're, if you're like a tribal guy in the woods, are guys, get the girl pregnant, they realize we're not going to be able to fucking before this one and you're Charlie's wife or boot booze wife, we got to get rid of. You can't tell me they don't. They're not eating berries or

Speaker 1:          00:27:19       fucking running hard into a tray. So what I mean like I have a abortion stomped at this angle and this is where you run. If the calming your body and you don't want to baby, you run towards the abortion had dumb fucking take one right in the gut. It's like a perfectly shaped tree. God Damn. Yeah, for sure. Somebody must've figured out somewhere along the line there's gotta be a way to stop this fucking kid. But the point is

Speaker 2:          00:28:00       you're a sex edge that that's, if I had that as sex education in fifth grade, I would've thought everything a lot differently. My head, you come in and describe it all. Listen, I know you guys getting into it and you know, these are the risks. And you said everything you just said

Speaker 1:          00:28:18       like wow, I would have changed my whole perspective on moving forward. Well, you know the egg, the egg shoots into this. That's what they teach you. And so the teaching nonsense coming and people feels awesome and there's a reason for that nature. Just trying to get you to make more people because nature is still the same setup that was around when we died real young when there wasn't that many of us. We could, you could wipe out some, you know, we were shitting in the street so people were getting plague and how they'd have rats, they would carry these diseases and fleas and not deaf. Fought like a gene off from tossing her own feces. A gene off. Yeah. Yeah. So why do we have to come a lot? I've got to make a lot of people just to keep the fucking party rolling. And I think that's one of the things that's going on today when you're seeing people become more of like, a lot of men are gravitating towards being more feminine.

Speaker 1:          00:29:12       And then you hear the phrases like toxic masculinity, like phrases that we never heard. We were young that almost like denigrates the concept of masculinity and some sort of a weird abstract way. But I think it's because we realize, hey, we don't need to fuck as much anymore. We don't need to go to war as much anymore. Like, like we're, we're progressing into some sort of a digital universe that we're moving into and it's not going her car, so much chimp meat, you know, so much chaos in blood. So I as a culture, people were sort of moving away. That's why when something like the UFC comes around or, or heavy metal or something, like something just openly aggressive, like guys like you or I will go, yeah, let me be me. Then me being me.

Speaker 1:          00:30:04       Oh my God, I've trying to drag me to the future. That should be politics. That should be, I would see that as politics one day. Some guy who was in the room, you want to be the governor, guess he's in the ring summit. There was a fucking photo that I took off of a twitter today. I think somebody put it up, I'll find out who put it up. Um, but it was a, just a little sign that was outside someplace in Texas that said, uh, instead of having a president, why don't we just all agree really hard to be cool. And uh, and I saw that. I was like, what? That's so that's so fucking simple, but isn't that going to be what it is one day? Like isn't it kind of moving into that sort of a direction? Isn't that what going to be one day? I hope so. Just everybody be cool. Just relax. I think that's what's we're, we're moving away from all of the fucking, the weird base physical needs that we constantly have to feed. Right. Moving away from those. But don't you think whoever is aware of that anticipates that

Speaker 1:          00:31:14       and they're already counteract during you mean though? Like the powers that be the pal is that became the the evil cabal and an old room. Know what I mean? Books, leather bound books in the wall. If you have a leather bound book, you're an asshole. How about that? And if you're one of those guys with a bunch of books behind you, Polish tradition in gold, fleeting pleading, I don't think they can manipulate it nearly as much as we think they can. I think they definitely manipulate the things they can and I think this world has gotten so out of hand that it's on its own. It's working on some kind of crazy instinctual momentum towards progress. I think those old dudes for sure killed Kennedy for sure. I've seen the arguments for, I've seen the arguments against somebody killed Kennedy and it wasn't just Lee Harvey Oswald to, everybody's got this either or thing. You know [inaudible] Harvey Oswald acted alone? I don't think so. I think he's definitely was in on it though. I think there's a gang of people in on it. I think he was one of the people that was in on it. It's highly likely that Lee Harvey Oswald was out of his fucking mind. Crazy asshole working for the government doing some weird shit and Russia comes back over here. Mary's a Russian lady. There's all sorts of wackiness to it, but when, okay, good opposite. I'm just rambling, but what is all that

Speaker 4:          00:32:40       that that was back in the 60s that's what is all that manipulation. So I'm going to [inaudible] and they were trying to figure out how to retain control. Kennedy wanted to break up better reserve. Oh, a bunch of people. First of all, he wanted to get rid of the CIA. He wanted to get rid of the NSA. He wanted to get rid of a bunch of agencies. Do the CIA or the NSA, one of those. He wanted to dissolve. He wanted to get rid of the Internal Revenue Service. He wanted to get rid of the federal bank. Like Kennedy had some radical ideas. He wanted to change a lot of things about the way the world was. And he also wanted posting and and mass. Did you ever read, no one ever hurt? Did you ever hear the whole speech? But then the, the famous one he did. It's always the end asked.

Speaker 4:          00:33:25       Not that thing, but did you ever hear the whole speech? I'm sure I did everything. What you're saying he was a bad mother fucker, dude. He was little. He was saying like, you know, hey listen, there's enough means we can all get along. Oh Geez. Just really have a fucking hippie yet. Did you ever hear the stuff that he said about secret societies? No, dude, play this cause this is from that stuff. I know. I'm not saying you can't know. Look, I've, I believe her dope. My friend Eddie Bravo, who I love to death. He loves every single one of them. Every conspiracy that comes along, he dives into it. Fucking hook, line, sinker. He loves them. I love their funding and fund to fund because he had the dads get my little house in my little lawn and to Vince foster. Look it up.

Speaker 4:          00:34:11       Did you ever hear about that guy who is running drugs through MENA, Arkansas gay. He's in then move. Yeah. Yeah. They would trap and coke at a place. It was barry seal's. He's working for the CIA, dropping coke out of planes and they caught these kids, found it. They killed the kids. Was that the game show guy? No, baby. Oh yeah. Chuck Barris. Yeah. Yes. No, Don buress is our friend. It's not, what was his name? Did they make a movie about that guy? Yeah. Chuck Barris. Yeah. It was kind of like a, uh, like a fake movie, but pretending that he was at a hitman or something. Yeah. I fell asleep. Watch at once. It's one of those movies. So you know, I would get exhausted with this talk is to be really, really paranoid. Hey, let's listen to the heroin. I just did you go? What do you do about all that? Good, longer speech. Good. Perfect. The shorter version won't want to hear. I know. It's exhausting, dude. This'll get off the shit out of you.

Speaker 5:          00:35:16       Ladies and gentlemen, the very word secrecy is repugnant in a free and open society and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies to secret oaths and a secret proceedings. We decided long ago that the dangers, excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweigh the dangers which are cited to justify it. Even today, there is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions. Even today, there is little value in ensuring the survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it and there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of official census ship and concealment that I do not intend to permit to the extent that it's in my control and no official of my administration, whether his rank is high or low, civilian or military should interpret my words.

Speaker 5:          00:36:32       He had a night as an excuse to sense of the news, to stifle dissent, to cover up our mistakes or to withhold from the press and the public the facts they deserve to know for we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on Kubot means for expanding its sphere of influence on infiltration instead of invasion on severity one instead of elections on intimidation instead of free choice on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic intelligence, economic, scientific

Speaker 4:          00:37:29       and politically was about a motherfucker. We could just listen to that whole speech and just bail on this podcast. But what does everyone give the trophy to? What does it say on every poster? What does he most famous for? Not that's all they took was that last end of the speech. You said ask not what your country, you didn't who remain, who that all should have been on it. So that is also a part of the same speech is that same spectrum, same garden that I can, I'm not going to act like I'm a historian here. It is the same guy who said that and you never hear that. Spend some shows here. The other part can be never heard that said that. You know, that's the sickest speech I've ever heard by any president ever. Then again, I don't listen to anything. I'm a two minutes in, I'm out. Well it's hard to listen to them because you know it's horseshit. It's horse shit. And they all talk like presidents, you know what I'm saying? Like they don't just talk to you, they'll talk to you in this. Like there's a, there's like a pattern there. They're locked into that. You can't read

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       when someone talks to you as if you were a person in the audience. You know what I mean? Like there's a pattern and the way he's talking, they don't reveal much about their actual motions. They put on a mask you put on, when you do a speech, like a pelt politician, you're putting on a verbal mask and you're not allowing people to see much of you. That's why when we see a little bit, you know like when Hillary Clinton's shrieks and people like why, why is everybody concentrating on it? Because you're getting to see a little bit of her. We, you see a little bit of her through the mask, right? She's got this two inch thick political mask that she's put coats of paint that have now hit two inches thick from all the years of doing this. So when you hear a shriek, it's no different than if you watch a third grader and a play.

Speaker 1:          00:39:28       Right. When those kids come out, it's the same monotone. Uh, yeah, that they don't know their lives. They don't care about their lines. When I, when I watched the politicians talk, it's no different or paint. It's more fucking painful to watch that. Then my third graders, horrifying play every single year they do well. That's one of the things that bummed me out the most about Obama. When I first saw him, when he was first in office, when he was first running for president, I was like, this guy is going to be like a new Kennedy. Like this guy's going to be like this guy who changes everything with the way he talks and the policies that he creates. He's a young articulate, I mean he's essentially close to our age. He's like three years older than us. He's, he grew up in our age, grew up in our era.

Speaker 1:          00:40:14       But don't you think he's putting that situation somewhere along the line to like, listen, yeah. Nice. You get to have a nice little run here. But there's some other rules you need to abide by. You understand? I can I say that with southern accent southern as you know, I pitch southern. It just, it sounded scary but meaner and it scares me more if a northerner gives me a threat. Uh, for some reason southern or scares me more cause I really, it's more medicine that, you know, it was a burt reynolds movie. Which one? The fuck was that movie. And then when the swamp as first movie deliverance, deliverance squeal like a pig. Remember that scary fuck traumatized. That was our, when people grew up in the east coast or the in the northeast, when you're in, you heard those movies, you saw those movies around there.

Speaker 1:          00:41:06       That was like our introduction to look scary southern people. Oh, so what do you think Obama, would you want Obama come on dude. I thought I was, I thought it, I was looking at the future. I thought it was looking at someone who was going to change everything. I thought, I'm like, here's this guy who's like everything we always wanted. He was a Bush was like this guy who was almost anti intellectual in a way. It seemed like he would take these like real shortcuts to the way he thought and the way he expressed himself. Real obvious shortcuts. It wasn't, he didn't express himself in a way where he was trying to get really intelligent people to say, okay, this guy is well thought out when he was doing was he was expressing himself in a way where he was trying to get like really dumb people to think he's one of them.

Speaker 1:          00:41:51       And there's two different kinds of people. You know, there's, there's someone like Obama when he was running for office. Well, here's a good, here's a good example, Ron Paul's great example, right? Ron Paul is obviously very intelligent and he speaks to both the intelligent people and talk to the people that might not understand all the concepts that he's discussing when it comes to big government or intervention and foreign policy intervention intervening in a foreign countries. When he does it, it's like very clear and concise and particularly well chosen words. So Obama was that guy like to me it's like Obama was like the opposite of the guy who was appealing to her dumb people. Obama, you know, he's appealing towards Obama was appealing towards youth and hope, you know, hope and change was like the big part of the uh, well all these years later, what's, what's really changed that much joe?

Speaker 2:          00:42:45       Just think about this though. Okay. All right. You get to that part. I get it. I'm with you 1000%, but, but the realistic, like a realistic view, don't you think? Where you look at every great hero and there's that fear of death. Like, oh, I like salmon. These concepts. You talking about the key kids. Nice kids look real nice over there. So he wanted to change. It's awesome. Um, let me show you a little video of Mr Kennedy's last guy had that big dump fucking speech to remember John Lennon. Wasn't he cute? Huh? Do you think they killed? Imagine all they send Dad Wacko. Oh, I fucking Wacko. She son of a bitch. But isn't it more likely that people are obsessed with John Lennon? Because these ladies are amazing artists. Could be like that little girl that got shot in Florida last week. Horrifying. Horrifying. But do you think that she was a part of the Illuminati?

Speaker 2:          00:43:46       Was there like some sort of a plan to stop her and her, her message of freedom or was it just crazy? No. Anything. If it wasn't in love with her, just a young girl was the singer I went for what I'm saying? Yeah, most likely it could be crazy. Fuck. I know that a lot of crazy fucks. I'm just saying I th I think everyone wanted that from any politician. Right. But the mid, that politician, you can't, you, you can't denied it. The first guy to actually has free reign and he faked everyone out and he got to that point. It's gotta be nearly impossible to go listen if they shut off the phone, if they shut all communication down right now it's cause they don't like what I'm saying. Boom. Until you have that brutal honesty. Could you imagine going to happen?

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       Hero man, what'd he gets out of office and tells everybody exact what the fuck happened. Did he say that when he was president? Because it would kill us kids.

Speaker 6:          00:44:41       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:44:42       Oh, no one's very sick.

Speaker 1:          00:44:46       This is terrible. The government, they're watching, they're listening to everything we say. The NSA, they recorded. Isn't that really funny? They're blower watching me. Yeah. What are you gonna do different? Really? Board watch me. Here he goes again. Another fucking speech. She was 17 year olds. This another thing, people think that there's this like gigantic conspiracy to watch over everybody. And I'm going to bring up the, uh, the guy who broke into the White House. You know, the story broke in the White House and no guy broke in the White House, got arrested a couple months before. You know, the only two people have ever broken into why not? I do remember this one was from like 1912. A guy broke in. They tackle them quick. This one was from a year and a half ago and the guy who broke in, he got arrested, I think it was in an in September, but he got, he got pulled over in July with four rifles, two handguns and a fucking machete in his car plus a map of Washington with an x where the fucking White House is.

Speaker 1:          00:45:42       So he gets pulled over with that two months before he winds up breaking into the White House. Like this is how poorly they're watching us. Like this idea that there's this a bunch of evil geniuses that are watching 300 million people's every moves. It's ridiculous. They can't watch anything. There's not enough people. And the people that are watching, they don't give a fuck. They want to go home. Right. The guy broke into the White House and one of the things that he was doing, he ran across the lawn and the guy who was supposed to be watching the dogs took his earpiece out cause he was talking to his girlfriend on cell phone. Wow. He had a second radio. They keep it back up. Right. Oh he forgot that in his locker. This is the kind of people that are guarding the world. So like this idea that there's like these super geniuses that are in control of every move and they hired a hit man and hypnotized him.

Speaker 1:          00:46:30       Manchurian candidate style. No are you? I was talking to my girlfriend hard. It would be to talk someone into killing someone for you and then getting shot and killed himself or getting locked up in jail for the rest of her life to how fucking hard. That would be really hard. It would be almost impossible to count on that kind of pulling it off to like, cause you would have to get someone who's probably never killed somebody before and that's going to be their first killing. You're going to go kill John Lennon and then get locked up in jail for the rest of the life. You convince this guy's going to do this. Like how are you going to get this guy to do this? Most of them are going to fuck it up. Like how we're all the fuck ups, you know? How come, how come a bunch of people haven't fucked up and missed and not pulled it off? Now they're always successful because there are just fucking crazy people. They're just fucking crazy people. I agree for all those ones that we think there's some grand conspiracy, it's much more likely that people retarded way more could be, but there's a few fucking real ones like that Kennedy speech where he must, didn't know he was in deep. He must have known, he knew about Scotland bones and all those crazy little fraternities and those guys belong to where they fuck each other and take polaroids and blackmail each other for the rest of their lives.

Speaker 1:          00:47:44       If we don't go to war with Libya, certain cache of photos won't be released to the press, you know? Right. It's really that simple. It probably probably compromise them when they're young in some sort of a weird way and get them to do gay stuff probably. Right. I mean, look, I have no clue if you're running, Huh? If she were funded like one of those Yale clubs. Yeah. That's the best way to shut them all up. But what he it, well, of course. Yeah. It get some gay porn on them, right? Of course. And it starts your religion, 16 millimeter and some dark dungeon in Connecticut this year, right? Charlie? They got the fraternity logo on what's the skull and bones logo look like? So fucking cool. Something death metal, maybe even all the skull and bones shit came out of the same pressure. You know, when you think of it then all those rich, rich guys that are rich fucking dads who aren't paying attention to them and they're going to boarding schools it.

Speaker 1:          00:48:52       Oh, look at it. Ooh, you can't, whatever you do, don't make a t shirt with that on it with your name on it. People would be so upset. So what is, I don't even know what this is. Is this cell phones? I butcher. It would be here too long. I butcher it too. It's, it's a fraternity or a group that, uh, a lot of former presidents belonged to. Like John Kerry belonged to it and Bush and, uh, it's just a Yale fraternity, like our club. A secret club of many, many people who wind up being leaders in the free world. Well, yeah, pull it up. So I stopped butchering it, but it's one of those things that people point to when they look at evidence. The 15 what does it say? The 15 most powerful what members of skull and bones, the most famous secret society and America, skull and bones was cofounded Yale in 1832 by the father of a future president.

Speaker 1:          00:49:43       And it's come to signify everything that attracts and repulses the public about and quotes the elite. Rumor has it that Yale Junior class members are tapped for membership each fall by some measure of leadership, influence and breeding among the business titans, poets, politicians in three us, presidents that are rumored to be members. We've picked out our honor roll poets. What fucking poets and what they're talking to other ass. That's one of the things. It sounds good. Wow. Look at this. Look at the all the members. William Howard Taft Clay class of 1878, a former president, uh, Amos Alonzo stagg class of 1888 Yale's greatest football player. What did he do? A bunch of uh, sports stuff. Okay. Uh, sports stuff back for black people figured out sports. I don't count those. I really don't.

Speaker 1:          00:50:34       When you playing when Lebron James was alive? No. You're barely playing basketball. Okay. William Avril Herrmann. Look at this guy. Future governor of New York, a presidential candidate. I see a bunch of people that we've never fucking heard about, but people that were governors and look at that pres. Prescott Bush. Let's have that. Pull that up. Let me see if you thought w was a wild man. His college years, you should have met his granddaddy Prescott. The future senator from Connecticut was apparently a real cut up. Who along with some other bones men is believed to have dug up and absconded with the skull of the legendary native American Warrior Geronimo during World War One. Whoa. He Stole Geronimo Skull. That's pretty gangster. Legend has it. The journos head is still inside skull and bones headquarters known as the tomb at 64 high street in new haven. By the way, new haven is a shit. No offense to anybody who is in new haven. Is it better? No, it's not. No, it's a bounce back cause the gentrified yet they used to be a comedy club there. I remember that place. Joker's wild. I don't remember it lot. Was it in a fun hotel? No. No. It was just a comedy club there. Yeah. Wild dude owned it. Crazy guy. Saw Him beat a guy up with a shoe.

Speaker 1:          00:51:50       Yeah. Some guy was talking shit, I forgot what, what happened? What have, I forget what caused the fight cause I was on stage and uh, he pulled his shoe off and hit the fucking guy in the head with the wooden part of his shoe. His heel of a shoe. Yeah. So I don't know what the guy did to him. The guy must have hit him or something, but he was a wild man. But that whole area was like super sketchy. Like drive it around to the club. Dark and creepy. It was lit. It was, it was borderline like sketchy. Yeah. It's weird that skull and bones is there. I don't know. He's scared. No, not scared. Let's kill the shit out me man. With Prescott Bush character and it scares you. It scares. It's Darth Vader, Dun Dun Duh Dun Dun Dun Dun. You know what's interesting? They talked us into believing that George Bush was from Texas.

Speaker 6:          00:52:40       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:52:41       Where is he from? Connecticut. How about the Maine and Connecticut? His Dad was from a Zad from Maine, right? Didn't they grow up in Maine? Pretty sure, right? They're both on this list. I was just trying to see if it says no. There's a gang of uh, people on that list at why not being present. It's just stop and think about how crazy that is. But she'd be, be a little wound up being president there was getting this vote. Yeah. Well the phone you get to vote. Do you think that maybe they hired Donald Trump to just act like a total complete shit head? Because they knew there were so many Republicans that are shitheads they could just get them to the, to the podium and then he would crumble under the weight of Hillary Clinton.

Speaker 7:          00:53:27       It's the greatest professional wrestling act ever, ever. Really is going to build walls. How many shows have we sold the extra, extra, extra large as a flying off the shelves. The wall just got 10 foot bigger. That's what I said. That's what I told him. He's a, his deliveries, very pro wrestling, his delivery, super pro wrestling. He's professional. Fuck it. It's brilliant. It's brilliant.

Speaker 1:          00:54:02       Teach what's washed the part where he says the wall just got 10 feet bigger because it is a guy in a movie.

Speaker 7:          00:54:10       What do you want to make America great

Speaker 8:          00:54:18       said. They will not under any circumstance. I said the wall just got 10 feet higher. Look at that guy behind him. Pause for a second, pause for a second. Then

Speaker 1:          00:54:35       that guy behind him, that's silly man. Right to whistling. Look, we're looking at him on the left. That guy, the guy right over his right shoulder. Okay, that guy. See that guy? That guy is a problem because guys like that, they're not supposed to make it this far. They're supposed to be eaten by wolves a long time ago. They're supposed to be like that guy that keeps surviving and game of thrones. It's with the wildling lady with the buddy. That guy is more bad ass. He keeps figuring out a way to survive. But this guy, there's, there was a Duncan trussell podcast he did receive recently with Tim. Hi Decker and Tim. Hi Decker, who was from Tim and Eric. Hilarious, amazing guy. He nailed it. And one of the things that he said that just really resonated in my head, he's, he said there's always been this desire that people have to identify with the strong man and two to give in to submit to the strong man and that that's what he is.

Speaker 1:          00:55:27       He's the strong, super confident man and that guy over his shoulder is the kind of guy that looks like, you know, probably probably a nice guy. I probably sweetheart maybe eat a little more than he should and it doesn't go to the gym when he should and you know, the alarm clock goes off. It's hard for him to get motivated. So he's just not, he doesn't have a lot of get up and go and he looks at this fucking trump guy with his orange skin and it's crazy hair, makeup, hair like a, like a Kennedy. Could you imagine given that due to pot cookie and a mirror and go, hey bro, what's going on up here? What is this? What's going on? What are you doing? This is, this is madness. Like you're better off having bald spots than that. If you have, you know, you just go like short trimmed hair with some bald spots. Like just that's way more gangster than what you're doing. Like what you're doing. It's kind of crazy. Like no ones that doesn't know insane hair does not look like that. It just doesn't look like that in the wild.

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       And like what you've done is you've used some sort of chemicals to concoct something like you've concocted this, this resemblance of what your hair used to look like and his face. Is it really that? Is that the lighting or is that orange or is it really that red and orange? They do him up that he's got some people to do him up and the kind of people that do him up or probably like the kind of people that really like him and they kind of like some orange skin, they want to fight both. It's war paint. They want to fight.

Speaker 4:          00:56:57       It's white people. Warpaint well why doesn't he do the under eyes? Like if you're going to do your whole, your face like that. Do you think he wears like giant goggles when he gets in a tanning booth? Is that what's going on? Like why is this is just white. Surely he knows what he looks like. Right? But then, but then you look at his hair and you go, well why is he doing that? Then you know, why isn't he just Jason stayed it. He just tapped into, he just watched Fox News and just sweat. Okay these guys, these guys need a hero. I think he's just got an extraordinary sense of confidence in some weird way. People are attracted to confidence. Yeah. Well that's what high decker was saying. Hi Decker was saying that this desire to submit to the strong man is like, what's going on here?

Speaker 4:          00:57:49       And I'm like, God bet. That's right. I bet that's a lot of it because we've been talking about these guys, that campaign for him, like how excited they are. I didn't know if it was, I don't follow politics at all. So I apologize. Marine papers as turned off a while ago, but just from sitting back and watching, he's the only guy and I don't know if it was planned that way or like I said, it's professional wrestling. Like here's what's going to happen. You're going to go here. Then you're going to bow. Oh, why do I have to flip into this fucking 20 visits? You're going to buy out the polls. Love them. That's stopping. I'll put you back in a fucking office where I'm just saying he's pissed now. He's been in government 15 fucking years. It cause he would go up on this podium and the only thing what people responded to, he would call people out and people loved that. They already give that to you. 24 seven shows like Kardashians and all. It's so twitter, every insult, insult. That's the new fucking little guys power. He gets up there. He insults people. I'm calling you out. CBS. He does. Whenever you know it, they're like, I've never seen anyways. He's not empowered.

Speaker 4:          00:59:04       How it working? It's fucking brilliant. Keep them all yellow script. It's fucking lives go what's going on? They're jamming too far out. No, you're perfect. Yeah, you've got

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       it nailed. I mean, not that, that is a guy who's a manager in a pro wrestling show.

Speaker 7:          00:59:28       That's the manager. That's like,

Speaker 1:          00:59:30       if he was like representing Bruno San Martino and he's leaning them towards this, the squared circle, he'd be like, yes, yes. This is hall Colgan's manager Donald Trump. This is what he's going to do. If he loses and Hillary wins, he's going to manage Hulk Hogan and the whole is going to have to go back to wwe is going to make a comeback because he to Gawker is not going to pay him. And so, uh, he spent all the Gawker money and that's gonna be, that's gonna be the plot. He spent all that Gawker money cause he thought,

Speaker 7:          00:59:58       I thought we lived in a country that abide by the rules. I thought when you go to court or you lose, you pay up. So I bought a house in Florida. I really liked this house. I don't want to lose it. So finch and I came to an arrangement. I come back here and kick you are candy ass president.

Speaker 1:          01:00:22       W W was what are the disease? The president of wwe. His ass. Yeah. Yeah. I mean Vince Mcmahon and hall Cogan. They have a match. Cause Vince always wanted to have a match with Hulk Hogan and they go at it and he makes $50 trillion. Oh look at that. Donald Trump and vince mcmahon. It's already happened. He was on it a couple of years ago. They shaved. I think he's telling you he shaved his head. Shaved Vince's head. Oh good Lord. Let's look at this. This is hilarious. What a good show. Vince is. A smart man will tell you that. Brilliant guys making a lot of money. Why didn't he run for president? He'd when he would, when he'd fucking win. How scary is that? If Donald Loses, he might win. Dude, it doesn't scare you that that many people, there's people that still believe in big foot. Wait a minute. Back host, and I had bobcat Goldthwait and here a couple of weeks ago arguing that big foot footage was real. No, you didn't.

Speaker 1:          01:01:25       Bobcat is a big foot believer at, first of all, he's going to waste. I see it. Yeah. No, no, no, no, no. For Real. He's got a movie. He's got this movie called Willow Creek. It's really good. It's not a, it's not a comedy. It's a horror movie about big foot. It's like Blair witch, so he doesn't believe it's rewritten. Believes it's real. And he went to the big foot conference. You still sell that? Nope. Nope. No. I know bobcat. He really believes it's real. He know only to, he believes that that video, that Patterson footage of the fucking deal in my suit. Yup. That one. Yep. It takes, that's real hundred percent yes he does. Is he does. I know. It seems crazy, right? I think he was playing, you know, a lot of people do. Every time we talk about this, I get fucking hate tweets from big foot lovers, just big foot lovers. Oh, big, big for love it. If he was just fans on TV, this famous big foot. And I love the ghost that they're always fine. They're all trump supporters. It's weird. Right?

Speaker 1:          01:02:21       But no for real. Bob Cat really is a big foot believer. Wow. That's odd to me. I don't see him as really thinking that way. Well, I don't know what it is. My used do it my mom. That's how I realize my mom was a little dopey cause as a kid not being serious, they've lost the bigfoot show and I'm thinking as a little kid I believed it. They would interview literally people on a rock like a hippy and it's like, yeah, he was just hanging out and he was kind of in his head and my mom go ice, believe it. My father is gone. She, Jesus Christ. There probably was something at one point until there was, well, there was definitely an animal called gigantic [inaudible]. You know about that? No. What is it? Oh, Jim Brewer. What does it all up? The photo of John Carroll Pythius next to a human being.

Speaker 1:          01:03:07       It was a huge bipedal hominid that they found bones of in Asia. In the 1920s there was an apothecary shop and China and an anthropologist was in there and it was studying some of the teeth that they had any recognize this enormous teeth tooth to be a primary tooth of unknown origin. He's like, this is way too large to be a gorilla. Like what is this? And where'd you get it? So the people brought him to this apothecary shop. There's a photo of a recreation of a gigantic Pacific is next to a guy, the orangutan? No, no, no, no, no, no. There's a, just go back to the images. Please go back to images. Scroll down, you'll, you'll definitely find it. It's gigantic. Pithy gets next to a person. Can, I just shows you in scale. But it was a, so they found bones. Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:03:53       And they found lower job bones that would indicate it was a bipedal ape. Okay. So I guess it's the position of the jaw is different. If you're on all fours, then if you stand up so that, that's it right there. All right. So this thing lived as recently as a hundred thousand years ago, and maybe more soon. But this is like, they didn't even know about it until 1920 when they got these bones. So in 1920 they had those bones and they had them once carbon dating was invented, they dated those bones to a hundred thousand years ago. So that was a real animal. Can I just tell you, if you, you need to change the whole edge. I would go to school every day. If this was school as a kid, like learned about big foot and we know we went everywhere we went today we just sat there like, dude, fucking bad that I'm not coming up going back to school tomorrow.

Speaker 1:          01:04:43       Ah, well there's cool shit to learn man. This is cool shit. Like this is cool. Anthropology, I'm not sure if I deny it though because you have to. You have a tid. Listen, that's a real animal. Well that's a a hundred percent confirmed animal. That's a confirmed. They just found it. Who, who founded archeologists, they dug up and anthropologists, they studied these bonuses. We're getting $400,000 of shares and funds. If we don't find a goddamn tooth or something, we got to file out like Dag every fucking place. We can't Charlie. And there's place. I know PRC interest. It's just another way to get money. Yeah, but they have the bone, so you can go see the bones and other anthropologists studying the bones. The bones get the guys to white coat. We approximately say that. I would say estimated 13 myths, 13,000 possibly upside. That's 130,000 years ago.

Speaker 1:          01:05:41       This thing roamed the US. I can't have putting it out in the real special one time magazine and the, what's it called? What was the fucking monkey call? Gigantic Shark. Good to pick a pickup and a stress discolored. Read all about it and pay $10 you don't mother fuckers, but why is it any weirder than a gorilla grill? I can see, and we physically can see it. That's almost not, you know, they didn't even know mountain gorillas existed until the 20th century because white people never went that way. Yeah, exactly. And when they first got photos of mountain gorillas, they were like, what in the fuck? Yeah, no, these are real 1920s yeah. Find out when they found, when they first discovered the mountain gorilla, I want to say it was the early 19 hundreds and uh, you know, that's an animal that we just take for granted is definitely being real.

Speaker 1:          01:06:33       This is a lot of those gym. There's a lot of those. This is a guy who's been dedicated his entire life to trying to find a giant sloths in the Amazon. This guy is convinced that the giant sloths in the Amazon still live mountain girl was first discovered by a German officer in 1902 nine two oh two captain Robert Vaughn Beringia. Prior to this time, only lowland gorillas were known to exist. The mountain gorillas subspecies is derived from the captain Robert Vaughn bearings. Last name gorilla bearing g Barend. Gee, what does that gorilla Bringi Bringi. That's his name. Robert Vaughn. Prng what? Why they have to have it twice. Gorilla Benji, Benji, what's around in 1902 like what's going on? Not a lot. Photos are only 40 years old thinking that before that they were drawing shit. That's, that's how crazy that is. Like sticks. Yeah. And drawing and well, I mean painting.

Speaker 1:          01:07:28       I mean, you know Michelangelo and all that, all that's trip was before that. But that was how you got images back then. You had to paint them when we don't, we don't really, we take photographs for granted so much. We don't realize that the photograph was invented in the 18 hundreds. I mean that's not that long ago. All right. Now why was this guy even think about this? 18 hundreds you didn't really have great shoot. Why, why are you just going up in an area? Why theirs? Cause he's nowhere near from Africa where it was the guy, well there was a lot of explorers back there in Africa because they had found it and they started to colonize certain aspects of, of Africa, like the colonized South Africa, which is why they all use a nice word for it. Slaving. Yeah. Dutch. The Dutch came to Africa and uh, they enslaved people and they made these settlements and they tried to make settlements in the Congo itself. But the jungle just

Speaker 4:          01:08:16       swallowed everything. Always. They would make, they would spend all this money and have boats go down there and they built these beautiful mansions in the Congo, but the Congo always ate it up. It's just too wild. They just couldn't, they couldn't tame the Congo. They thought they were going to go there and, and figured out how to tame that thing. Teach them all about, uh, Noah's Ark and things like that and their abcs and they just couldn't survive. Six months. You can survive in the jungle itself. Like the jungle itself was just so fucking wild. There's no taming the Congo. Like you would have to have like a full scale Western invasion to tame the Congo. We would have to clear cut and start chopping down giant swaths of the forest and putting up malls and blowing coal into the air and lighting everything on fire.

Speaker 4:          01:09:02       And we still wouldn't win. It's just too much of it. It's too big. She had been able to shows the Congo gets all the shows. No. What's so shows where the true, they throw you out there naked and afraid. They don't go to the Congo. It's the one place that I haven't been yet. He ain't gonna make it. We don't have enough insurance to cover you in Congo. Nagin and Fred means eaten. You get eaten. But can you imagine it's 1902 think of everything. You've seen your life at that moment, right? It's not a whole lot to see and you're going up the mountains and surely there was a tribe guy or something that was like, well, it Booboo, give him that little term like don't go up there. He didn't know what he was saying. Finally, go up there. Imagine first time encountering a gorilla.

Speaker 4:          01:09:52       Jesus. You've never seen anything like that and your life. Is that a fucking huge, what the fuck is that? Yeah, I've seen maybe a hippo. Is that a hippa? Like can you imagine just squaring off and if that thing you ever see, like when a gorilla charges Jesus and that guy, that guy, I would have flipped out. Yeah. Imagine being in a time when there was no photographs and visiting the jungle in Africa and seeing all the wildlife. Seeing a lion sees a fucking line and what do you win that's going to protect you from it. A lot of guys had been eating who was this shame? That's supposedly the picture. I was just reading a story about when they found it. This is like the, his encounter. The first one they shot. I'm going up a volcano or something that said, wow, man, that they were tracking them and it took them hours to even find it on a high and a half the body by the time they got some of it or something.

Speaker 4:          01:10:43       Whoa. This is a picture shot. The gorilla body by the time they got to it. Yeah. Oh, I'm not quitting. They said they had shot two. They killed to the shot too. I'm not sure if how they killed it. It didn't say it, but they retrieved it by rope and they found that it was about 200 pounds, the one they found. Dude, Africa is still crazy. Have you been there? No, I was going to go to Tanzania this summer, but I heard that you have to take all kinds of crazy shots. No, no, no. You take a malaria shots. Yeah. I think he'd take two shots. Yankee tickets? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       Did you take your kids to Africa? Yeah. Did you? Yeah. Where'd you guys go with Tanzania? Did you? Yeah, it was sick. Was it? Did you lose? It's there. You can follow. You can follow a, there's a tribe there that you can follow for like two, three days. They take your hunting. Yes. It's Kronos. It was a, there was a part of her. I got really spooked out because the guy we were with who just has a spear, he's just sitting there with a spear and he said, uh, you know, stay here, stay here. And he was going after some low animal. It was just me and my daughter. Like, oh my God, why do we do with an African? Yes, Jamie. We'll think of that like, here I am from Florida, now I'm spear hunting with some African dude and my kid. What the fuck, man?

Speaker 1:          01:11:59       It was weird, but it was awesome. It was really awesome. You should go on it or shows your mind now I should, I have a friend who went there and he was on a hunting trip and uh, poachers were in the area and when they see poachers, they just start shooting anthem shooting at the poachers to shooting at them. And he's like, you have to shoot them when you see them because they will shoot you and they will kill you. And they were getting shot at by poachers. I'm like, so you were in a gun fight poachers? Yeah, cause they want that Tusk, they didn't kill anybody but Simon Tusk, a lot of it is just meat. It's like these people just starving to death. It's crazy like that. Who's coming in to get all this ball? All sorts of different various variables that you got people that are poaching for like Rhino Horn, ivory tusks and stuff like that.

Speaker 1:          01:12:42       That's all you really hear about. But then you got people that are poaching just for meat. They go on someone's private land and they kill the animals and they call them a poacher. What they really are. It's just fucking poor people. That's it. So anyway, wow. These people, you know, sometimes the poachers were shooted them and they shoot at the poachers and so when they're asking, I'm like, what do you do if you shoot one of these? And he goes, most of the time we let the Hyena sorted out. Wow. Let the hyenas sorted out. Like Cue, I'm managing your shooting people and just leaving them for [inaudible] is to eat. You've got human eating hyenas in your backyard essentially, and you're watching it and that's, and you're accustomed to it now. They must have seen it at least once, right? Yes. It must have come upon a guy that they just shot, checked on the body and seeing the high end is tearing it apart with that noise. Ooh, they're the creeps. The green there, the creepiest, they're so weird. So weird looking with their big back legs or the big front legs and shorter back legs. They look there there. They're mysteriously dark. They're all lopsided. They're not like flat. You know, like a dog is flat, right? Hyenas or like like a ramp. Yeah. They go, they slope down this slope downward. Really big jaw. Oh, look at that fucking thing. Look at the size of the God hyena industry and some interesting facts. Oh, history.

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       Look at the, go back to that picture again. Please look at the fucking mouth on that then. And they don't fear law. They'll go after lions to look at the teeth on that thing. That's insane. That doesn't even look real. Like if that was in a movie, you'd be like, fuck, I'm glad that's not real. Africa's is so gangster. That's, that's the real deal. Yeah. You know what's weird is like, that is where life started and where life started. It's where it's the most ferocious. Think about all the different animals that we did. You know, that there was a lot of animals like this that lived in North America. And there was a Hyena that was like a fast running Hyena, a type of Hyena here in North America. This guy named Dan Flores. He's got this book on the, uh, American Serengeti and he was on my buddy Steven Ellis podcast talking about it.

Speaker 1:          01:15:05       He's a wildlife, a historian, a nature of the story. And uh, he was talking about how crazy the animals were in North America, just, you know, a hundred thousand years ago, they don't even know what, what, what caused the mass extinction. But there was a bunch of crap. They had a lion here, there was bigger than the African lion. It's called a step line. So is this from the divide? Because I'd even realize that too, until I was good. The content and the bering strait. Yeah. But there was also like just mass extinctions here for some strange reason. And they really don't know. They don't know. No, you don't. Horses like native Americans didn't have horses. The Europeans brought the horses to the native amount. I didn't do that. Yeah. But here's where it gets really crazy. Horse has evolved in North America. Horses evolved in North America and went extinct and the only horses had survived with the horses that had been captured or had gone across the bering strait and made it into Asia.

Speaker 1:          01:15:58       Those are the horses that survive. So then when like Arabian stallions and shit came back from there into North America again, they had literally originally evolved in North America. All the canines evolved in North America, like wolves, Hyenas, uh, or um, uh, um, what of those dingoes all those things originally came from North America. Coyotes, maybe not dingoes is that an Australian? It's a strain. But do you think they brought them on as part of something? They brought a lot of shit over to Australia. Australia is filled with animals that don't belong there and they don't belong anywhere else. No, they're all bald is a lot of, well there's like kangaroos which are only there. His real hair. It's panda bear, Panda bear. One of the heads. A better the Free Koala bears. Oh, Koala bear. Koala bear got some weird shit man. But um, they also have like, they have a ridiculous amount of animals live in there. And then they brought in cats to kill some of the animals and then the cats got out of control and now they have a feral cat problem. They also have, you know, it scares me. I will never have too many things you can eat and kill you. Oh, I think more than Africa. You can't swim in the ocean and they get the saltwater crocs. Oh, the saltwater crocs

Speaker 4:          01:17:10       and the worst outcome. Shark attacks South South Africa in Australia have like the worst shark attacks. Snakes, they get the worst snakes, bugs, spiders, all kinds of spiders. It'll fade house them. But the people are cool as fuck. Yeah. Australian people are some of the coolest fucking people you'll ever meet. I'm a big fan. Big Fan of Australian people. If you had a move, is that where you'd go? Well that's a good spot to move because it's on the other side of the world. So if we blow this thing up and we need somebody with a greenhouse and Sydney, that's the move. Because if, if, if we don't make it, if America doesn't make it, like save yellowstone blows. If don't blows up, kills everybody in the continent. You got to have to go somewhere where the transition would not be that that difficult. And Australia I think is the furthest away with a transition would be easy.

Speaker 4:          01:18:03       What if it got too crazy and it was way too many people in Australia, they leave. We're like, you can't. We were cutting the border. It's say do that, you know in Australia. That's one of the reasons why Australia so awesome when a bunch of immigrants show up in a boat then like not so fast fuck face. They turn them around and they sent it to some shitty island. We got home real was here and to make him eat bugs. Yeah, it's not good. It's not good. I'm not kidding man. They're brutal. They're, they're like, they're anti immigration policy is like widely criticized, but it's one of the reasons why apparently it's a, it's, so who was it that told us about that? Josh has apps. Was he the one, the first one to tell us about that? So some, one of the guests who was from Australia, it was, I believe it was josh was explaining how crazy they are about stopping immigration.

Speaker 4:          01:18:46       They just illegal immigration. It's like a no, no over there. They just won't let it happen. That wood, that wood, that's like a scene of a movie. Something goes down here. Yeah, man. These are people going down there and then not letting you in. Now there's, sorry, there's so many [inaudible] world, but there's only 20 million people in all of Australia or something like that. I think Australia itself, the whole continent of Australia has the same amount of people is California. Really? Yup. And it's as big as the United States. You can't live on a lot. Is there a lot of desert there? Well, you can't if you're a pussy. What if you're fucking man, just move out in the 23 million. So it's probably less than California. Yeah. California is probably like 30 million. If I had to guess how many people are in California? No official population, it's probably gonna be a little under, but easily that money.

Speaker 4:          01:19:34       Yeah. They're not counting Mexicans either. No. Friends of my Mexican friends. But listen, I wouldn't have my fucking paperwork either. Fuck it. 38 million of Jesus Christ, just calc. And that's not even including illegal aliens. Right. You know, another fucking crazy thing. Somebody brought this up somewhere recently. I forget who it was. Maybe I read it somewhere. Um, they were talking about what percentage of native Americans, uh, like in Ra in Mexico, like Mexico has a lot of people that, a percentage of their genes are native American. The same as the people that came from Siberia, but in Mexico. Yeah, yeah. That I believe that genetic differences between Mexicans and native Americans is like very small. Well, there's a lot of times, and I'm not to offend anyone, I'm just being honest where I, I can see that a lot. No, I couldn't tell. Is that person Mexican or is that person a native American?

Speaker 4:          01:20:34       I swear to God, I just did the other day at Frickin citywalk trying to be racist and I wasn't sure which way to go. How do we culturally appropriate that's a barrel or a feather and I know it. Yeah, makes sense. Yeah. They all came down from Asia along with all these fucking crazy animals. And this Guy Dan Flores is talking about, they had a single, a short face bear. Is that what it's called? Jamie? Short face bear is fucking enormous, terrifying bear that they think was one of the reasons why people didn't come to North America sooner because there were so dangerous. There were huge like bigger than grizzlies and super predatory and so like when people were coming across the bering strait there, it's probably just getting picked off. Oh look at that thing. Oh look at it's giant and it's chasing down a buffalo in this photo. Some youtube videos. Fuck yeah, the Chrissy just chasing the moose down the street. Yeah. It just takes him down and he's, he's, he knows he's going to get them loose. Is half eaten, still running? Just looking back. He's sick. I'm going to catch up to you.

Speaker 4:          01:21:44       It's fricking, it's horrifying. It's scary, but it's also real god, these things still exist and can eat you at any moment. We still part of the wild and all we are, we've just made cities. Here's one that's the one I'm talking about chasing this buffalo giant ass grizzlies chasing the buffalo. He's half torn up already so big and say that that buffalo got burned in some sort of a volcanic fire or something like that. That was, that was an already injured buffalo. Look at him. He's already had enough. Oh God. They're so terrifying. Look at his mouth. He's foaming is foaming. Look, he's got an air. Oh, he's in the air dude. And he probably weighs 500 pounds and he leased and he's booking it done street shit. He probably was more than 500 pounds. That's a buffalo. He's probably like six or 700 pounds.

Speaker 4:          01:22:34       What am I guessing? What do you wait, what am I fat shaming a bear. Why might, why don't care? Anyways, I'm obsessed with a number. Did you see, um, I don't know if you're watching this. I just watched it on the plane. Uh, what's the Leonardo Dicaprio one? Where he gets told the revenant? Yeah. The, did you see the scene? Yeah, the bear scene. Yeah. That's the first time I actually, I don't know what you think of it, but that's the first time where I saw how quick that can ha they, I thought they made it real how a bear can just, yeah, within a second he's on, he was over there so big and they move so much faster than a person can. We, we, we judge everything based on what we can do. Like we see an animal way like okay via to run towards him right now. How long would it take? But the timeline that an animal can close in on you versus what you can do to them is so goddamn different. Like you just don't understand how fast they are. Spat all my rage. I am still just a rat cage where you live in New Jersey. New Jersey got a crazy bear problem. They're overrun with bears in some areas. Um,

Speaker 4:          01:23:44       there's bears but they're black bears. Yeah. No one not as scary. They get spooked out really easily. They're scavengers. They're just looking for garbage. They don't care about you. They are for the most part. They definitely do term predatory though when they get really hungry. Some of them are predatory. I know a guy who was camping with some dude. It was his first hunting trip and he got attacked in his tent by a 500 pound predatory black bear. Huge hungry, older black bear. Just took a chance. Went in the tent, just try to Jack. I'm in his tent. His friends shot the bear, shot through the bear and hit him in the wrist. So he wound up getting a broken wrist from the, from the rifle and they, uh, chase the bear out of the tent and shot it in the woods. Wow. How about that for your first fucking camping trip?

Speaker 4:          01:24:34       Totally. No, you're not going to see animals bears here of these fine. Most of the time nothing happens. Most of the time they run away, but they killed that kid at rutgers was like a year and a half ago. A kid, uh, who got eaten that rutgers. Rutgers, yeah. He was outside of rug kid. Kid from rutgers outside in the woods and, uh, took a photo of the bay or right before it ate them too. They've got a photo of the very bare that one up killing him. Apparently they ran and they saw the bear and they freaked out and ran when they ran the bear chased them. And uh, one of them. What can a bear, was it black bear? Black Bear? You know, they ate meritus hiker, snap photo of bear before fatal attack and West Milford. That's the bear right there.

Speaker 4:          01:25:18       Yeah. I mean if you, if they have an opportunity to eat you, then each year they eat each other. I mean, if you kill black bear and leave it there, the other one's lead it. Wow. That's scary. And they're gangster. That's near my house. Well, there's, that's a real animal dude. I mean, you guys have a lot of them in New Jersey and we saw him a couple of times in the last two, three years. They would come up on my back deck and tear down the a bird feeder. Whoa. Just right outside the, it's, and they're big creatures. Yeah. How big was the one you saw? Um, maybe like, like a big dog. No, it's a little bigger than it is. Bigger than a dog. Like a couple hundred pounds. Probably some 300.

Speaker 4:          01:26:00       That's a fucking big animal, man. Look at that. Holy Shit. Bear takes a dip and New Jersey's family pool. Yeah. That's a big one too, man. God Damn. That's a very big ass bear to find swimming. You're fucking pool my net. Holy Shit. The size of them. Yeah. See that's a mature old bear. That doesn't give a fuck. Right. That's just so weird. They live with people in New Jersey of all places. There's one, there's two. There's two wacky black ones. There's um, there's a good video in my nephew's neighborhood where the two black bears are going at it. Oh, far rockaway. Yeah, the one that we played that before. And then there's one in Jersey that walks on its hind legs. Yeah. Did you see that one? Yeah, it's big foot, bro. That's a big foot, big foot video for you. I think that's exactly what those were saying.

Speaker 4:          01:26:59       Bears can do that apparently all the time. They can walk on their hind legs. They just don't do it very often. Look at that thing. That's weird. Yeah, but he walks through the neighborhood like that. If you were like at dusk, right? Right. And it was really dark out and you saw that thing walking through buck glint of moonlight, you would swear it was a giant gorilla. Yeah, that's big foot. I listen. Yeah, I know him before I joked at big foot, but I saw him last night. It's like a dead thing. But for real, like a black bear can easily get to be seven feet. Yeah. So if, if you got a seven foot black bear it and you see it walking through the woods, or even a fucking six and a half foot black bear when she get her pants. Yeah, you're going to swear it's way bigger than it was just walking on his hind legs.

Speaker 4:          01:27:42       Nobody ever underestimates or giant two foot to walking on two legs. Gorilla. You don't underestimate the size of the thing. You overestimate it. Right. You know, if it's six feet tall, he's like, he was fucking eight feet tall, right? Yeah. Oh my God. New Jersey is pretty rural. People don't realize that. They think of New Jersey as being like, like were Tony Soprano loved or they think it's Newark Airport. Hoboken. Hoboken. Yeah. There's a lot of woods in Jersey. And you also have the shore and the Jersey Devil and Jersey Devil. I've uh, I might've heard of him. I might've heard them. What does it sound like? Um, it's a little bit like a screech owl. Ooh. Yeah. Screech owl. It could be, that's a problem.

Speaker 4:          01:28:37       There it is. This the devil. It looks like a camel. Fucked a dragon. Now I will say this. I will say this, one night my wife and I were sleeping and on the roof. That was really did have, it sounded like something landed on that roof. That was me, bro. Nah, look at it. It's got, it's a goat with wings. Is that the Jersey Devil call it is that, was that the photo? Look at this. See, here's the thing, right? Jersey devil doesn't scare me as much as the fucking alligator that pulls babies out of a Disneyland and drags them into the lagoon. That's a real thing. That's, can you, can you imagine a, it just, I've been in that with my kids. I've been in that they need to have signs. I think they do. It says don't go on the water. It didn't say that's filled with dinosaurs.

Speaker 4:          01:29:27       Didn't say this man eating dinosaurs in there. That's where I think the problem's going to lie for them. Where if you're from Florida, I still live there. We you have you heard about it all the time. Small dogs. Two year old toddler. I lived there too. I lived in Gainesville between ages. What, what, what year was it? It was like the early seventies. We lived there for like three years at a you youngsville. Yeah, and uh, round Lake Alice. He'll look at that thing. Yeah. Oh, they climb fences. Now, have you seen this? This is so scary, but I talked about this in the podcast recently when I was a kid and we lived there. They were endangered and so you couldn't hunt them. Nobody hunted them. And now they have so many of them that they give out hunting tags. Like for that swamp people show you ever watch that show?

Speaker 4:          01:30:11       The kill alligators? That guy had 500 tax. He could kill $500 how many fucking alligators do they have when you give someone 500 tags? Yeah, it's crazy. It's a real problem. Then I would say, so look at this guy. He's climbing a fence. Jesus Christ. Look at that fucking thing. I mean that is straight out of, that's the Chinese hundred million years ago. Yeah, that's a dinosaur. I don't think they've changed in a hundred million years or something crazy like that. There's some nutty number. It's like 50 million, something like that. Like how long dinosaurs are a alligators have been exactly the same. You're just food. Just food. That's all you are. I don't see, I don't see your wife or kids. I just see food. It's not like you look at the baby deer with the Mama dear and you go, I can't shoot her. She's got the baby. You're about the splash about and alligator that someone posted this video of what?

Speaker 4:          01:31:04       What? This alligator was like right next to a splash mountain. I'll pull up that way. There's a worker in Disney. Watch all, Gosh, I'll close the people get to it. Let's call. It was like, wow, I can get away with a stick. Why like 2009 I think. Oh, how do you not just kill that thing? You got to kill it. Look, it's, it's little enough right now that you can kill it. That's a little baby alligator. Get to it as well. That's a small alligator, right? Oh No. Loud right next to it. He's right next to it. Yeah, look, oh my God. They just tolerate that kind of Shit in Florida. That seems like a really little alligator by the way. He's little, but he could do a little damage. Fuck that alligator up. I'll tell you right now. I will fuck that alligator up. I'll grab it by its tail. Now. Bounces head right off that sidewalk over and over again. They'll turn it into a Dick Holster. I'll make him cradled my balls

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       for the rest of time. Look at this guy. He's going to get a net and try to scoop it up. What does his asshole dude with a net, you need a gun son scale like the end of the pool skimmer. Go get yourself a crossbow, shoot that fucking thing. Right. And it's caveman brain. Caveman brain. Wow. What's wrong with me? That's a, that's a lizard. I mean that's a heartless, thoughtless creature that exists to eat things to say it's all does that coming to this is more of now than they've ever been before and this trend continues. You got a real fucking problem because when I was living there, so I'm trying to figure out what year I was born in 67 we lived in Florida until I was a law. No, we lived in San Francisco from age seven to 11 so I was 11 years old, somewhere around then what year was that?

Speaker 1:          01:32:49       What year? [inaudible] 73 I'm way too stupid. If it was 73 probably about five years old. Six, seven years. 73 Oh six yeah. So swimming on, so somewhere around some, we're talking somewhere around 1977 okay. Okay. So you like 10 to 12 these are kind of prime ready to go. So just think about this year, 1977 now think about 2016 so in 77 they're protected. In 2016 you can kill 500 of them. What the fuck is it going to be like 50 years from now? What is it going to be like in 2066 you had to be able to go anywhere near there or is it just going to be some crazy Congo type situation where every time you get out of your car, so I'm just trying to eat you and kill you? I think they're going to the Amera coble under the guise of president trump, president trump will guide us. He lives in Florida. I live in Florida.

Speaker 1:          01:33:45       We will kill them all. We will have golf. He likes golf, right? He's a golf guy. Guys get golf courses and shitty designs, golf courses. So he's not going to tolerate people getting eaten by what if like Jack Nicholas, one of those older dudes was at an event and something just debt, big 15 foot of that. They got on video the other day. She says enough is enough and jumps out and grabs him right by as polyester pants right by the deck just right over back front from where the eyes are, the Dick side and then the bottom is on the asshole side and just clamps him right up the middle like a paper clip and drags me the rights. Flips him a couple times because it doesn't give a fuck about CBS filming. Some golf show doesn't give a fuck. It's not going to not kill you because this is a CBS Golf Day. That's right. Why? The women are doing wonderful today. Women golfers have really come a long way. Oh Jesus. Alligator comes out, eats a lesbian drags, just drag it right into the water. It doesn't give a fuck about your show. It's going to 50 million year old brain. This is three brain cells and they're just trying to find things. Things that can eat, eat, eat, fuck, eat, fuck, take nap in water.

Speaker 1:          01:35:07       They found Nile crocodiles in Florida. Yeah, they found quite a few of them. They have a shoot on sight thing for Nile crocodiles now. I said, you see him? You have to kill them because they're already, they've already found, I believe they found four and uh, it's, they're definitely laying eggs. They're definitely breeding. And uh, if they found four, there could be hundreds. Like they literally don't know how many Nile crocodiles there are in Florida and you're not going to radically cut them. So you just have to do your best try to curb the population. It is like modern day Tarzan Shit. Oh yeah. Hi. Drive to civilized ours just to people fun. The beginning. Now we put the jumbo to them. Why do you think it's a coincidence? And it's all happening in Florida and then the 10 Tony Montana, cocaine cowboys, all the coke, all the pills.

Speaker 1:          01:36:00       Okay. All the oxies Florida gave out more oxy prescriptions and the rest of the country combined. Really? Oh yeah. All that Shit's going on there with alligators and Nile crocodiles and fucking vipers in people's yards. All these crazy snakes and pythons and people just add, I don't want to take any of it anymore. They throw it out there fucking back door. That's what they did in Florida, right? The pythons. Yeah. 10 1520 I get huge and they eat people. Oh yeah. Fuck yeah. The elite people lead everything. You go to sleep. That's another thing. Just lives. Eat and sizes you up makes its way through your air ventilation system. It's as fat as the pipe that your air condition comes out. Look at this Nile crocodile identified in south Florida. Jesus Christ is just last month. This is another one. Fuck Man, those are 21st God damn dangerous there. The the willdabeast. Exactly. They're really a scary because there are way bigger and way more aggressive. Like you can't be anywhere near them. They're very different like temperament wise and alligators. Send them beast. Yes, yes. Let's go. We don't have weapons. Allowed them to buy their own piece and they'll leash them upon themselves. I love that. Dot. Did them unleash their own punishment to their stupidity. They'll weaknesses creed. They will continue to the [inaudible] themselves. What about the ones who are strong? Get them pills, make them weak. Oxycontin.

Speaker 1:          01:37:30       Oxy doesn't sound like something though. Kill Ya. Sounds like a cool chick that we know she plays in a band. Hey, where's oxy? Oh Ah, oxen went to visit her family in Sweden. Oh, that's cool. She's a bad ass. That's oxen. I see. Beautiful Hair. Big Smile. It was like a scooby doo band. Oxy would be like their friend that comes over and plays along with them. You know, she's just,

Speaker 4:          01:37:56       this is not even a hint of any sexual attraction with anybody. Knocks. He doesn't fuck no one fucks. No. She just makes the situation better. Yeah. Yeah. She's just cool. She comes back over and the band plays cool song and credits roll programming programmed America and fed them alligators. Apparently alligators tastes really good. No they don't. No, no. What makes you say that you've eaten them in flow? At least that's what they said they were. Oh, like you've had like those alligator tail and fried gator. Yeah. Got to eat it fresh and say gotta eat it fresh, but apparently has more protein per pound of meat than any other wild game. Really? Yeah. It's like his is up there as high as anything else, like higher than even like elk and um, and buffalo and bison and things like that. I hated it. Ah, see, find the find out.

Speaker 4:          01:38:43       That's true. I don't want a lot of people it was, it was added to he, yeah, I thought it tastes like shit. She, but I think that's because it's prepared bad. I think you're getting it from some sort of a like a fucking Fridays or something like that. Like kind of a chain. They say if you get it the right way fresh and then cook it like the correct way, it's apparently very delicious or probably just, yeah. Yeah. You're probably right. I might've get it cause I didn't, I remember the restaurant was like a special, so it was fine. Like a trial run in some guy's cousin. Like trust me, you just cut these up. Yeah, you fry them. They're amazing. 46 grams of protein per serving, so holy shit, that's insane. Let's start eating them. That's incredible. I think that's way more than anything else. If that's okay, I'll find something new and meet the other meat. That's incredible. Hold on. Well this is only 3.2 ounces for 3.2 ounces. It's 46 grams of protein. That's insane.

Speaker 4:          01:39:45       That is what it says, right? It says 3.2 ounces. Yeah, dude, that's incredible. That's the main, it makes sense. You're reading a goddamn dinosaur dinosaur. You eating its tail. That's what you eat. It's all, yeah, it's all muscle to cut it up into like steaks. That'd be prepared. Good though. Yeah, I would. I would like to try it. I mean, I'm just talking out of my ass. What's that? Much as a domestic beef and for the city twice as much as domestic beef. Well, why don't we feed people fucking alligators. Don't we give it a run? Yeah. He gives all these people worried about, you know, like a large scale consuming of beef and the harm on the environment. We got to kill these goddamn alligators, so why don't we just start fucking eaten them, eh, grow alligator farms and kill these fuckers and you'll lose weight because you're eating pure protein. Right. So you're right. I don't know, does it probably, you probably get all ramped up. I bet if you eat that stuff, it's probably a soup. Primal for Eaton, an alligator. Your Dick probably gets hard as a rock. I mean, have you ever thought that? No,

Speaker 1:          01:40:55       it's got to happen. That only make sense. Like why else would do eat like mountain lions? Do you know people eat mountain lions? The, yeah, the Loin, the muscles in the back straps, the muscles that are on the outside of the spine. That's where like the tenderloin is on a beef cow, like inside connected to the spine. That's the same that does the same meat. They like to get off of mountain lions, but I mean why would anybody eat that unless you were a really hungry or be, it makes your tent cards crowbar. Just imagine if we all found out there's like a type of food. It just makes you rock hard and they're trying to give you pills were actually, here's the answer and she needed mountain lions need to study math, crocodiles and shit.

Speaker 1:          01:41:44       I think, I just think we're just so disconnected from these animals that we have like some sort of a weird fairytale idea what these things are just wandering around Disneyland like they should have guys that they hire to go kill these fucking things. Like, why are you letting these things live? Because we're out of your mind. There's too many of them. They're going to keep breeding. They eat everything. They eat. Dogs and cats and children. The gators. Yeah. They're going to fucking keep eating things like you guys and this idea that all life is sacred. Your life is fucking sacred. Stupid. They're going to eat you. They're gonna eat you. Why wouldn't he damn. Well, they're going to eat you. They're definitely going to eat you to eat you. If you don't eat them, then they're going to be so many of them that they're definitely gonna eat you.

Speaker 1:          01:42:25       Yeah. Keep simple wildlife biologist strategy. Do I have just kill everything mallee or stand there? They help the environment. They do that. That's one thing about coyotes, like everybody hates the coyotes out here. You know how many rats we would have? It wasn't for these fucking cards. What do you, what would you rather have? Would you rather, I think cody's, we're cool. Of course. When I lost the chicken and one recently, did you really? You got chickens. Tell me chickens, your gut. I just got five new ones of God. Um, do you just want to any for now for eggs, they're like pets. So do you let them walk around the food? Do they eat fleas and ticks and all that? They had everything. They had all kinds of bugs there. They're a little dinosaurs man. They were really cool but you can pick them up and, but I got the new ones.

Speaker 1:          01:43:11       They're a little chicks. They've actually gotten pretty big really quickly. It's crazy how quick they turn from a chicken to like a little chicken. What happens if you start? What do you do with the other chicks? Like what do you, when the glory introduced? There's my checks. There's a, these are the new ones. These are the farm I have, um, a large hen house. It's really big. So they can wander around in there and they're all protected from the coyotes. It's an enormous thing. But then I also let them out in the yard, but I got to keep him away from my dog. He's decided that he can kill them cause the coyote talked to him. Coyote honey dictum. Yeah. The coyote became friends with them and then talk to them and to go in and break into a one of the side coops and kill him on the chickens.

Speaker 1:          01:43:53       So hearsay. Yeah, you have to take chickens. They brewed sometimes, which is they get this thought, there's no rooster if they're not getting fucked all the time. They, the laying these eggs for no reason cause there's no chickens ever going to come out of those eggs and not fertilized. So these eggs are just, it's just free food. It's basically the product of you giving them food. They lay an egg and you eat that egg. Right. It's really interesting. Right. But the hen, sometimes they get crazy because these eggs never become chicks so they think they're supposed to like sit on the egg and it becomes a check. And so they start pulling their feathers off and they do what's called brooding and it'll take a long cycle. It takes like 28 days for them to get over it. Unless you catch them early in the brood and you separate them from the rest of the chickens and you put them in a stand, like were they a, you put them in a smaller cage where they have to stand on a bar.

Speaker 1:          01:44:40       And once they do that, because they're not in a nasty, not sitting in a nesting box, it, it goes through the cycle and their brain, they're little simple little reptile brains. And then you bring them back into the chicken coop and they act like a regular chicken. But otherwise they think it's like a health problem. They don't eat. They start pulling their, uh, their, their, um, feathers off of their body. It's like, it gets really weird. So I had them separated and uh, the dog, I have a huge dog, the coyote talk the dog and to knocking over the, uh, the chicken coop to get out the chicken, like the kyle probably wouldn't be able to do it on its own because it's not big enough. But my dog is a massive, and so the, there's a coyote, Kenny Dichter my fucking dumb ass dog. That's like, he came and he's like, listen man, we're buddies.

Speaker 1:          01:45:24       Which you're a doll. You're, you're a coyote technically just to house pet. No, they got fun too. They can fuck dogs and coyotes. Fuck all the time. Wow. He duked them. Yeah. They make babies, man. Uh, we ran into a, when I was filming fear factor wants, we're filming on this real rural area and uh, these people had a bunch of puppies that were half coyote and have labrador. Huh? Yeah. Coyote came over and fuck their dog, man, that was out here. Yeah. Like a dirty criminal sneaking into yard and fucking your daughter like, oh my goodness. A little escape convict.

Speaker 9:          01:45:59       Right.

Speaker 1:          01:46:01       I don't want you hanging out with them. [inaudible] it was cold out too. And these puppies were all huddled up together and we were like, whoa. Now what happens is now what are you guys going to do? They're trying to give them away and there was like, I don't want to have fuck fucking Eddie. Exactly. What the hell is that kind of eat my newborn too. It's a weird thing because they really are all bowls. Everybody. Everything's a wolf. That's why they can all breed with each other. It's so strange. You know, like a, a hippo can't breathe with an elephant, but a wolf can fuck a Chihuahua and may get pregnant. Zero dogs. Yeah, we're all dogs come from wolves. That's so strange. Like if a, if a, if a wolf could figure out how to fit his dick and a Chihuahua and shoot a load in that Chihuahua, the Chihuahua, it could conceivably have wolf Chihuahua puppies.

Speaker 1:          01:46:49       Yeah. Fuck. And what would it look like? Like that's again, like an alien, like a crazy, it looked like big foot tude ever seen those Werewolf mcats? Yeah, they scare me. And there's also some weird, is that a conspiracy you ever see the, the weird blue dog thing? Well what does that Jamie typed in shallow wolf breed. It's called a wolf. Sable Watts? Yeah. Is that, is it a hybrid or it's the AKC registered breed. Oh, whoa. A little tiny Wolf Chihuahua. I'm sorry. What'd you ask him? I don't even remember you asked if I'd seen something. It was some weird blue, uh, like blue eyed dog looking thing. Do you know what I'm talking about? No, it hasn't attacked. It was just, it looks weird and creepy and they got a video of it running along a fence or something. Oh, Chub. Macabre. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:47:42       You know what they think that is? What is it? I think it's a coyote with mange. They think that, uh, when coyote is get mange right and it's real common with animals. They get it's Mites and the Mites. That's like the, they get, they developed this horrible skin disease and they lose all their hair and their skin becomes black and fucked up and it gets burnt by the sun. Looks Awful. It just looks awful. And yeah, they look like that. So that's a Chub Macabre. Yeah. What it is is a, it's a coyote then that doesn't have any hair. Yeah. And uh, I think there's quite a few animals. Like if you go download that photo there right there, look at that thing. Oh yeah. I mean there's quite a, I mean it's probably in constant pain, you know, I mean it's skin is just all fucked up.

Speaker 1:          01:48:25       A lot of times there's like open sores all over their body. There's a dog or a wolf, wolf bear rather that has manged to chimps. Get it sometimes too. Right. They have ever seen those hairless chimps. Yeah. A lot of times that's what's going on with them too. They've got mange. I had a dog that had management, I rescued her, she had mange and um, they gave me this like ointment to get, but once I started feeding our good food at her hair all came back like real quick, just washed her with some certain type of shampoo. And then within like a couple months, like all the mains was gone, her hair was all big and fluffy and healthy. Oh yeah. Mangers. Uh, but that's what the Katuba copper is just kind of mange. It looks I started like a year ago in or what it was going on. If you saw that man, if you saw something like that, I don't sign person, but if I saw something that freak out.

Speaker 1:          01:49:12       Yeah. You think it is a market spinsters aliens. Yeah. That's why the Mexicans believe in the troop of Cobra. That's what it is. That's there. But they can see that where big foot though because the coyotes will fucking kill your chickens and shit. You know? And that's probably the he kill a kid. Oh yeah, absolutely. Right. Definitely. They, they killed this girl in Toronto a few years back. It was a 19 year old singer from when she should a country music singer. It was really promising young artists in Toronto and she's going for a walk and they killed her in the forest. Yeah, during the day. That's a bad way to die too, man. Oh, because they you asshole first. That's right. That's what they do. They tear you apart, it tear you apart. And if for some reason coyotes, they, when they kill a deer, and I'm assuming they do the same thing when they kill a human being, they start with your asshole.

Speaker 1:          01:50:03       And I'm sure that they tried to suffocate. Um, I don't know, man. I don't know. They just started tearing it. They might just start ripping you apart if, especially if they felt like it could hold you down because wolves do that to animals all the time. They just chew what their legs bring them down and then you start pulling them apart while they're still alive. Yeah. My buddy found a moose that was getting attacked by wolves and they found it, uh, and it looked like it had been getting chewed on for over a day and it was still alive. This is, Moose was all fucked up and half of its hindquarters were chewed off. And these wolves, we're just pulling it apart slowly. And they had been eating it for a day. Oh yeah. It's still alive. Brutal. Yeah. Again, like a settler just going around and goes, your brother, your brother, just get to, you watch it, brothers.

Speaker 1:          01:50:51       You get torn up. Yeah. And they're reintroducing those. That's as even more interesting. They're bringing them back to all these different parts of the West. And if you can get to those people that poisoned them back in the 18 hundreds if you can get them bring to the future, that's like, well, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. You brought them here. You know we used to kill these fucking things. You guys brought them here this way they have to stay in the areas outside of old hip places. They can't go hiking. Sa, Juna, Stan, the snow ed escape. If they go swimming, we have to crocodiles for the smile. That genius, they've must find. Nothing means of entertainment. That's well we call him inside. I'm television. I don't want to steal. Hiking is too dangerous. Hey Dan, you got fast black bears now, which we used to trust them.

Speaker 1:          01:51:41       It's just the idea just big up and how they eat. People Sat, Sat, nature's the great educator. You go out there in nature of balances you out to put things back into respective and we simply can't have that need them stupid and electronically connected and we need to grab all these tummy starts doing this and start new societies and why won't they lent Damn Pipe Poland? Why won't they sit down in this dinner when I talk about Ponce De Leon, Dr Dodge, after times of God, you know, it always kills me like straight edge guys like guys who don't smoke, they don't drink, but their intellect, super hardcore music, whether they're all like strat around and they throw their arms up in the air, like the fucking wreck it Ralph Ralph dance. I just went to a, and

Speaker 4:          01:52:46       uh, it was in Jersey and I, I'm fascinated how I'm not really fascinating. It's just, it's tribal watching grown men still go around slam as hard as they can into each other. Just just vent shirts coming off when it shouldn't come off someone's guys like in their forties they don't care that this is the first time I drank in three months and there and just smashing into each other, hurting each other. It's nuts. Yeah. Eliding yeah. Old Indians used to do that. Did they? I think so. The sets of the show in the movies, I wonder how much of that stuff's real. How much is that? Yeah, they really did. I don't know if they've ran around. I don't know. It's a good question. I was not there. Hmm. And who was really there if you had the opportunity to go and view any culture from the past? Like if you could be completely invisible and walk around amongst the Romans or cave people or native Americans before the Europeans came, what would you choose? Wow, that's really hard question. Yeah. Um, I think, I don't know when the time would be, but the first time where anything was trying to be colonized, like changed from being what your regular like the first time like a boat showed up in Polynesia or something like that and some white people got out. Right. We're used to being in the fields every day and, and you know, this guy hunts and this guy watches after the boys and teaches them and this one zoe and we're all, you know, and then all of a sudden they come up and they're building like you guys

Speaker 7:          01:54:29       native is why you live in, he calls for color. Cocks are the women are staring at their fucking balls two feet from the ground. What are these things? And they might, what the fuck is going on? Jesus Christ cannot fleas. Guys got a fucking look at his hair. It's chunked off his fucking Tito. He's got bones in his fucking here. Rice. Can I get a Bible lesson and there was this thing called Noah's Ark. Sit down. He's fuckers. Don't pay attention. Get you fucking round them up. Call Dobby and the boys. We're going to need about 40 these fucking things. Climb trees. What is your character's name? I love the guy who used to come back more often. This is Joe. They climb trees. What do you mean that they fucking, they don't even, they don't even with our hands and her at age of fucking car and he's up there for 20 minutes. Eat a Gundam. Leon. The fuck is going on. I'm getting eaten by ants. He's laughing.

Speaker 4:          01:55:31       Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. No, that's a, that's a good thought. Like the, that might be like one of the most important times ever. Right. When the people came from Spain and landed in the West indies, when, when

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       Columbus and the Pinta, that was where we landed, right? The West indies and they encountered the people that were living there. The native people that I think that I would choose that I choose that it's like the first, the thing that you could see like to know that this is this experience right now is going to fucking change the future of the world and I want to know the why, why we wanted spices and shit. It was what they wanted. They wanted gold and salt. So again, why like what was so why like all right, listen, we need to train them to be like us or like we don't, I don't, I, that's the part I go, what? How did we get from it? It's, it doesn't happen overnight where you wear your running after something with a stick or you just eat any farming than wall somewhere in a classroom.

Speaker 1:          01:56:28       Yeah. We have to work to make Wayne it give this guy fucking something. Is it again? Like the fittest one tribe is now starving and now I don't know. I think will see the other one. They wanted to expand their territory's. I mean it's like game of thrones type shit. The king wants to bring back more gold. And so he commissioned a fleet and he hires a captain and he promises that captain riches beyond his wildest imagination. If you go to these foreign lands, bring back salt. And so these fucking people would get in these wooden crafts that barely had enough food for them to survive and make it across that goofy ass ocean where they, who knows? There's no weather report. There was no iphone APP that I have no idea what the fuck was coming. And they were in a boat in the ocean and there's a lot of them didn't make it like probably like a good percentage, like a healthy 10 to 15% never fucking made it.

Speaker 1:          01:57:21       I bet you more. I wonder. There's a lot of shipwrecks though. People find them all the time and they find him filled with gold. That's it's crazy, man. They found a ton of them where people have gotten super fucking rich where they found like Roman coins are men and a gold worth $1 billion or something like that off the coast of this place or that place. The power of grade. Yeah. They brought back too much gold and they're fucking raft saying, think of that. How desperate are you to go? Okay, we're running out of places to find gold. Let's just, let's just fucking, but I've heard people who've died who gives a fuck, what are we going to do? He's be headed fucking people, but kind of get them gold. Like how desperate, like when, how desperate you got to be to go, we're going to go, we're going to start hitting other countries and fucking fight and Hindu, whatever we got to do.

Speaker 1:          01:58:11       Think about how terrifying it must be to have a boat filled with gold and you're trying to bring it back to Spain and you realize you brought too much gold and the boat starts going under and you're in the middle of the ocean, but you can't throw the gold overboard. There's discussions saw, we've got to get rid of some of this gold and you're looking out and it's dark out, right? It's just the blackening of sea and the water is slowly leaking into the panels in the fucking, in the galley at the bottom of the boat. We can't keep taking this on. We've got

Speaker 4:          01:58:42       to get rid of this fucking gold and they have a sword fight and there and they duke it out and they all wind up dead. All chopped up and bleeding in the fucking boat just sinks to the bottom because they had, they couldn't make a decision whether or not they should throw the gold overboard. I pawned it even today, you could drop a gps pin, but what are, what are the guarantees? You could go back to that location and retrieve it. What if you dropped it at the bottom of the Marianas trench and it's a mile and a half down?

Speaker 4:          01:59:13       It's gone. Good luck. Good luck fishing it out. You've got to, oh, it's cool, dude. We got a treble hook. My Dad's kind of like a deep sea salt water set up. I couldn't fix it. My Dad's got the ultimate set of tools to the fishing pole and we're going to die. If I hold my breath like a champ, I'm just going to get under that water and bring up one coin at a time. Oh, like they died because they were greedy. They died because their boats sank with too much gold. Fuck man, that's crazy. Or maybe the boat just sank and it just so happens and a lot of gold on board and a lot of times they made it with that much coal on board. Right? Yeah. But there weren't any fucking engineers that had done stress tests on the exactly. How much water to go.

Speaker 4:          01:59:59       Oh, and under pressure. We, we live in such easy times. Just carry credit card. That's right. But I liked that whole concept at the animals are coming back. They're coming back, dude. I mean it is what it is. If you look at Florida, you were like, again, I was talking about living there in 1977 we're talking about a very short period of time between now and then. It's just not that long. This is not, it's just not, no 40 years is not long at all. When you talking about biology to short amount of time for a radical change like that for an animal to go from endangered to ultra prevalent and eating people on a regular basis. Think, think of even this, the girl that was, um, I guess she's an African, all that, but I don't know if that just kept it quiet or secret or whatever.

Speaker 4:          02:00:48       And maybe it's happened many times in the past, but this one particular time the chick is in the front seat, she's taking pictures and their windows down and the lion just, just, lily would have grabbed her and pulled her out. It was just killed in front of everybody had done that was the game of thrones editor for real. Yeah. She was an editor. Oh, my game of thrones. Yeah. Apparently they told her not to roll the window down to, you know, I guess it's just so tempting. You feel safe. You're in that car with the lions saw that opening and there's a female lion too. There's a lot of pleasure. Think about that. Those lines, they tell you when you go over there. Oh yeah. They tell you, um, listen, they think it's just a big animal so they're not really gonna. He's just got to stay still and don't move.

Speaker 4:          02:01:37       Don't make any checking what? Uh, and he'll think that it's, uh, a big animal. And so that's your sales pitch. You're sitting there in the open and uh, the lines looking at you going, he's just thinks he's not going to jump. He, they told me they, they would have told me if people have been eating before, right. I would want to be in the back of that helicopter. Like that scene in Predator, we're Jesse Ventura has got the gun loaded. He's calling everybody a bunch of slack. Jawed faggots. I would want, that's the only way I would want to go. I'm going to go with a bunch of dudes with fucking bandoliers filled with bullets and locked and loaded with giant steroid filled muscles. Just read it out and never runs out of ammunition either. Yeah. I don't need a camera. I'll put a Gopro in my head will capture the whole thing.

Speaker 4:          02:02:25       It's sorted out. The pictures later, he says, let's just get through this. Let's just get through this. I'm not opening up the fucking window. No, I'm not opening up the fucking window to take a picture of a giant cat. It kills things every day with its face. No, keep the fucking with Deloris. Keep the window rolled up. You crazy bitch and you see that Paul, it looks like a catcher's Mitt with fangs. Just clamp, gets a hold of your tit and just yanks you out of the car, digs into your rib cage. God even imagined. It's horrifying. You sitting there with you fucking mets shirt on and listen to some good music on your ipod and it just pause through that window and digs those closet deep into the fucking bones in your ribs and carries you off like, like when you pick up a little pieces of Shashimi where the chopstick, right? It's that simple. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:03:20       Does even you come right out of that window in a second would take you 10 minutes to climb out of it. It's why we all need guns. The lineups are coming. Do you think that after shootings happen, the sales in guns go up? Oh yeah, for sure. 100% guy. Right? People get scared too when all the rhetoric starts getting around about ending the second amendment, taking away people's rights to guns. I mean, it's the best thing in the world for ammunition companies and rifle companies. Jamie, there's a video that people are throwing around on instagram. I don't know. I wanted to ask you, this is true. There's a a peep. Some people from another country, they're speaking a foreign language. They're talking in front of a lion carcass and they've got like, they're taking a photo and then another line comes in Jackson off camera.

Speaker 4:          02:04:06       Oh Wow. But it looks so fake. Oh yeah. It looks so convenient. Like the fact, the framing of it where the lion gets into frame and then jumps over the camera to get the persons, they scream and you hear the noises in the background. I watched. I was like, man, this is a way to theatrical. It's way too well framed. This has gotta be bullshit. That was my initial instinct, but was interesting. Oh, King's MMA, put it on their instagram page. My friend, a hot fail Codero who's a one of the best, uh, Moitai instructors in the world trains a bunch of world champions for breezy over doom. Hofeld dos Anjos a lot of people. He's a great guy too. He put it on his page and he was uh, it was funny cause he put a caption in Brazil, the Brazilian version of English, you know, you are in his house now. Like that kind of shit like here it is. Yeah. Yeah. I get this to any line. Whoops, go back. Here he is. Look at the um, okay. His, his words are interesting humans mentality there. Think it's a sport to kill lions. Well I guess the lions brother wasn't going for that. Okay. Going up. But teat Mr Lion, we feel your pain. See, looks fake as fuck. Right?

Speaker 4:          02:05:23       Yeah. Let me, here, let me see her again. I can't replay it. It'll, it'll replay itself. He ran straight to the person who had the gun. This is their house and nobody can cross that line. That's so hilarious. See the line comes back into focus. I don't buy that at all. I just think that's fake. Can I see it again? I think you're going to see shit. I want to see her. I got to watch her yet.

Speaker 7:          02:05:49       I'll just check the Kelly. Hi Kay. It's what? Can I be good stuff?

Speaker 4:          02:05:58       No did she would have never.

Speaker 10:         02:06:03       All right.

Speaker 4:          02:06:15       Lion comes back. Is he all those things. There's so much off their, first of all why did the line just abandon these people that are shooting it? Did it kill them and walk off real quick? That doesn't make sense cause there's two of them. If it killed two of them, I think it would have killed one and rag doll that around a little bit and then God to the second one. It would have taken longer than 10 or 15 seconds and you can add that side effect and it's a pain. Yeah. And then the rifle went off and it's just nothing happened and that they missed. Totally. They miss twice. All that stuff seems fake. Just the framing is the big one and then they're acting. Seems like shit too. I thought they were speaking another language. Apparently the speaking English, but that goes back to in order to think about things like that show, I literally sit there and go, humans will believe anything.

Speaker 4:          02:07:03       We're not even a thought process. The will just believe it. Yeah, no, it's the video. I saw it, but don't you think that's the, sorry. That's also like a smart video to make, cause that's what people want to see. Like people hate trophy hunting. They hate this idea that people go over there and shoot these lines and then prop them up and look big smile on their face next to some weird animal that they just shot some majestic beast. Right. It's weird, man. It's all weird. What's weird too, that people are celebrating that this is fucking lion came by and jacked him, went after the lady with the gun. You know,

Speaker 1:          02:07:36       like everybody's like all happy. The comments, comments are all happy. Like I'm not into killing lions, but uh, I'm definitely not in the lions killing people and I don't think that it's like a, it's not a revenge thing. I, that line would have killed them no matter what they, they killed their lions. That's what they do. Yeah, I, I get it. I get, I'll sit there and I'll go like hunting to me fee like hunting, finding out like teas on a reserve. If you aren't going lion hunting or whatever. If someone owns the land, not only that, they're, most of these things are a high fence operations where they have these lines are fenced in. Right. And they go into, it's like a cheap shot. To me it's more than that. I mean it's, it's kind of like shooting Ligo, dangerous pet that someone has.

Speaker 1:          02:08:28       Right. But technically they're free. But are they, a lot of them are not free. No. That's some sanding and Africa. They'd been caught and they tell you, yeah, I know. If we really breed them in the wild in these, uh, these enclosures, I mean not in the wild. In captivity, they breed them and then they release. Sometimes they release them and these lions have a very specific area that the traveling, and then they release him the lines on the, where to go. So they just hang out and wait. So when they release him, then in the morning the hunter in quotes comes out and sees this line just hanging out. Cause the line doesn't have anywhere to go. It doesn't belong there. It's not as territory, doesn't exactly know what to do. So he just finds a place to lie down. So he'll go under a tree and just lay there and then walk over and shoot these lions. It's fucking weird man. It's like, what is that like? That's, that is barely hunting under the loosest possible definition of the term bear. It's barely hunting. You Know Lion Lions? Video's fake. Yeah, I knew it so he can't get me bitch.

Speaker 1:          02:09:32       That's a real person is Yolanda. Oh, that's why it looked odd. See I thought it was almost like a fake line deadline might be in the faith part and they might've actually moving line might've been real. I'm not, I'll read more. It's so weird. But you know what's weird about this whole thing? You know, after Cecil the lion got killed in Zimbabwe, now they have to kill 200 lions because they have an excess of lions because nobody wants to go there. And um, nobody wants to hunt lines anymore because the blow back that they experienced from this cecil thing. So now they're, they're a sas in the cecil thing. You know that guy, that dentist that killed that famous lion? Yes. Yes. That's cecil the lion. Okay. Remember that whole outrage was really crazy. Like everybody got nuts about that. And because of that, nobody wanted to go there to hunt so that they have the lines that are decimating the undulate population. So they had to kill 200 lions, 200 lines that would have brought them, you know, I think they get $50,000 a lion when, when hunter comes and pays

Speaker 4:          02:10:33       to hunt the lion. So think about that shit. They like losing my, it's a fucked up place. Man is a crazy place. Louis Theroux has a beautiful document, if you've never heard me Yap about it before, but it's a documentary about him. It's he, it's on Youtube. Him going on this African hunting expedition with all these Americans. It's really strange, really strange jungle street wars, but the same that not some sentence. So it sounds like fricking jungles treat wars with the animals, but if you really think about it, you know, people get mad here because they don't live like that. They haven't seen well until like a lando, you haven't seen a wild animal snatch. A family member, a friend. Yeah. A child. So they're accustomed to like whatever that thing, that thing tears me to pieces. I still, I remember my mom getting eaten by that thing, so yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:11:25       No, I have no problem selling him off. Taking that thing out. Yeah, there was a recent, uh, there's this guy named Jim shockey and he's got this great show called uncharted. He's just sort of an adventure, travels all over the world and they hired him to go to Mozambique because all these people were getting killed by crocodiles. So he's going, he goes to Mozambique to hunt crocodiles. And while they were there, someone in the camp got killed and eaten by a crocodile. Some woman was washing clothes and get dragged into the water. You know, you talked to them and like those, those people don't, they don't have any problem with someone coming over and shooting a crocodile. No. Cause they said this said they see it. Yeah. There'll be no protests. Right. We don't make movies about this. There was an article in the New York Times after the cecil thing by someone from Zimbabwe that said in Zimbabwe we do not cry for lions.

Speaker 4:          02:12:12       And it talked about how all the family members that had been terrorized, all the people they knew that had been actually killed by lions. Like this is not a joke. Like you guys have this fucking lions king version of what's going on over here. Right. But even then, still, I don't want anybody to shoot a lion. Just seems like, just like anything. Then they'll say, well what weren't they move? Well, you don't know the conditions they are. You don't know how far they have to go. If they got to go across the desert or where you can't say anything to you live in that to live that way of life that tries me nuts and people just, well you know it's going on over there. No, I really don't send far away. It's so different than anything we can ever even possibly imagine happening in North America did.

Speaker 4:          02:12:53       I'm just worried about my teenagers get pregnant and my mom's kind of been an id here, so wow. They're trying to kick her out of, of her assistant living. Why? Because she's running out of money and um, her medicare kicked in and all of a sudden they're like, yeah, no, wait till you medicare so you gotta find a place for, you know, she'd been here. It's like, that's why sometimes when I go in this direction, I love going there, but at the end of the day, my stance is always, what am I, so now watch this. No, just what I love the fascination of thinking of it all. A crazy. It always, but at the same time ago, I got to take out the garbage. Now let's talk to this kid about fucking doing this and see if I can find some way for my mother alive for another month.

Speaker 4:          02:13:48       It just shit like that. You know what I mean? Yeah. You can't be worried about Cecil. So that worried about fucking cecil. Yeah. And I'm not worried about, I feel horrible and bad events at the end of the day. I can't control this. It's right here. Or maybe I can, I don't know about it, you know? But I like thinking about all of it. Well, the, the actual variables, when you stopped thinking about the future, they get real grim and weird. They have to to get better. No. Well it's not even that, like your body, like as I'm getting older, one of the things that I'm realizing, I was like, get up in the morning, especially if I work out hard, it's fucking harder and harder to do that. Like slowly but surely my body's not going to be able to do all this stuff that I wanted to do anymore.

Speaker 4:          02:14:30       But it's just not going to work anymore. It doesn't matter how much discipline I have, how well I eat, it just there's gonna come a point in time where things just don't work anymore. It's just the fact that's the reality of life. Yup. You wake up stiff like Oh and everyday you're going to wake up a little more stiff, a little more stiff, a little more stiff than the monster, a little more and it doesn't go away in a day or how many times. So the chiropractor and now I'm going to take a Ning Chung pow. The new thing come out from eight in the morning to nine 30 is that that back fat area meat is going to hurt for three, four, five months and I don't know why. And I'll have 14 different people telling me different things and then like take this pill and you don't make me feel that.

Speaker 4:          02:15:14       Then we have been alleviating suffering and Americans from more than 30 years now, 30 years. 30 years. Wow. Look at my lab coat. Do not trust me. Trust protector. Nope. My pen protector. I'm a cautious person. You must be really smart. Oh look, I have a clipboard looking at the charts and the results and that handwriting is completely trustworthy. You can't understand a word I wrote now, but I see a lot of x's and y's and numbers. Do you know, many people get, they get, uh, they overdose and die because of poor handmaids handwriting or they used to now they do everything electronic. Um, my wife, when she was going through Chemo, um, she would, she would take the other thing that would bounce her out and she went there and they gave her the wrong thing and the wrong dose and she came home and she looked like she looked like the creature from the black lagoon. She started getting lumps all over her body, all over her hands. And they're like, yeah, no, that's the uh, yeah, no, it's normal. That's usually, you know, it's one of the side effects. Just like, no, I had, I haven't had this side effect yet. This is freaking me out. Some of the things were going on with her and charity. She had

Speaker 2:          02:16:30       no fucking hair ready and know. It's awful when people go through it, it looked like aliens. People stare. You're like, oh my Gosh, dad can Jesus Christ, I support her because she wears the pants. So you, you, you got that going on. And I think the end of the week they were like, listen,

Speaker 1:          02:16:53       uh, sorry, I just realized you got the, the, you know, the dosage was wrong and that's why, and the good news is, the good news is you won't need it next time because you already met your needs for that type of thing. But it's good because it's, it's uh, what you got was really good. So what they try to do is avoid any sort of malpractice lawsuit. We'll probably, yeah, you don't know. Like here's what I gave you see the x, y clips and all that. I just don't understand why their handwriting would be so shitty. Like unless they don't give a fuck. Like if you're writing a prescription for someone, if I was going to write a prescription for Xanax, but Xanax was like a lot like Zana Lama thin, which fucking kills your Dick like a fucking sniper. And this is how you do it and you just sort of x socials. I mean you look at some of the writings that what a doctor's written down prescription wise and you're like, no one can read that. No one can understand that there's a website that charts them like bad prescriptions, like bad hand hand meant writing. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:17:55       prescriptions class. Here's the most important class question of the day. Why can someone tell me why when we sign these prescriptions now, don't forget you're a doctor now. You're very busy. You're on call you 24 seven yeah. You're on call at the hospital. Why do we make this type of signature? We're not really sure. Yes. Charlie in the back to make sure we could never really be sued. Excellent Choice Charlie.

Speaker 1:          02:18:24       So they make a signature that anybody could forge. Forge or I didn't say that. My Buddy Guido Orlando, he's a pool cue maker. He's a great guy and Guido had a signature. I'm not bullshitting. I'm going to blow up his spot. I want to, I'll show it to you. I don't want to show everybody else. So you want, I don't want you have steel Guido's empire. This was his signature. I'm not kidding. It was, he made an oh, he made a weird, oh, so his wife forge that shit. Cleaned them out when he got divorced. She and he fucking hated life after that man. Why? He was so angry, so bitter, so crushed. And I was like, how the fuck do you think you could just get by with that crazy signature? But he, uh, which you don't, you don't, you. He's a guy who liked, wanted to simplify his life. It was a very smart guy. He decided to simplify his life. That's how he did it. He's like, oh, I don't want this crazy sick. She make me sign things. I think signing things is stupid, so I'll just do that. That's my signature. He wrote it on everything, but he thought he was slick. Mm. Look at this doctor's prescription.

Speaker 4:          02:19:28       Wow. Yeah. Why don't you just give me a bullet, shoot me right in the fucking head. Just this crazy, this reading that is insane. Like no one can read that. I bet he can't even read that. It's amazing. 7,000 people annually die from bad handwriting. It used to be way worse though. This is a 2006 yeah. Okay, so that's probably what it is. They figured out. All right, how much is it costing us in lawsuits and [inaudible] 14 feet. How much have we made in the last two years? So that would be 50 trillion. All right then. This is not a battle then. It's worth the over doses. Please. I talked about Penny's think Dr. Schwartz maximum four hours a day. Unless they have to do surgery, they should be well rested and taken care of and they should be more of them. And let me ask you this Jamie, how many people die from malpractice guests? This let's guess this. I say a day. A year. A year. How many malpractice? Just fuck ups. Just mistakes. Accidents. Um, I'm going to say like to me

Speaker 8:          02:20:32       what? 30 grand. I was going to say 30. Oh my God. I lagging, I might say complete manslaughter. Running cross the land. Like fucking fields of buffalo. Chop Chop.

Speaker 4:          02:20:53       98,000 a whoa. Yeah, I was off by a year. I was. Okay. This is 15 years ago though, so this is 2000 2009 they did this. You would think it'd be 10 times better today though. No fucking Amen. She'd be like 20 it's still to be these teen. That's how nutty number man. 98,000 people die. Is that just America due to errors? Yeah. Check out mistake that was made on a prescription. Can you guess what that says? Methadone that don't yet know. It says method date, which is this is for a child. Where's the tea? Yeah, this is just supposed to be the tea. Oh my God. And so a child got Methadone and died. I must have. Yeah, I'm pretty sure it was lost that. Oh, I didn't want to hear it and think of that. You're the one adhd medicine. Oh my God. I think you this.

Speaker 4:          02:21:44       Well. You know that's fucking crazy. Anyway, you and shit to a kid. You gave that to your kid and trusted and kids like, trust me honey, you need it. You saw the man with the coat. The man with the lab coat tells you that you need this. This is going to make you popular in school and you saw the kids at the rite aid counter or you take Dave, they're very trustworthy. You interrupting class because you've got something wrong with your brain. The doctor's going to fix it. This test shows that and proves that this test shows right here. There's something wrong in your little second grade brain, sweetie. It's in a clipboard. It's right. It's believable and here's the best part. We're for it. We're covered for this insurance mean we covered for the kid, the kid, it's everything covered. They're covered for everything.

Speaker 4:          02:22:34       Beautiful. Thank you for having this job and support it as colorful. Don't. What's my thought? Oh yes, it's good because it's going to help him method. Now I'm looking, I'm researching this Bob and it says, this is, this could kill you and this should never be given to children. What about the days before Google when you, your doctor could give you some advice and you had no idea whether or not it was the right advice or not. But how about even trust in this scenario when you look it up, if fiercely says don't give this Nigga. Well it was the doctor said I should dude crazy is that it's crazy. And then the idea that you can't even make a tea, you lazy cunt. You're writing a prescription for a fucking kid. Cross a t for child. Let's see. And what was this named heroin? So while she's checking her phone, thinking about some new Jaguar, he's going to buy, right? I'm going to buy a vacation home this summer after all my surgery money, I couldn't hear the noise coming out of my muffler off. I'll get a new gal. I'm success. Perhaps I should smoke a pipe while I'm driving around my job wall.

Speaker 4:          02:23:47       Sophisticated English hats. They had like peaks on both sides. Try to impact, try to bring you down. You grew up in the bronx, stop putting on airs, shut up.

Yes. Contemplates things. Would you like to come in my yard and see if the new zebra and Giraffe, I just pet

Speaker 10:         02:24:25       face.

Speaker 4:          02:24:27       I'm just thinking if this is my neighbor, I'd be like, fuck it. I should probably just humor this guy. Go see a zebra. Just so he doesn't hate me. I don't want to live next to this crazy fucking zoo owner. He's going to make some poisonous snake. You mocked me for my z. Put into your mouth and now the point is this snake. Is he in your room? It's changed. We could have been friends. This damp giraffe just stayed. All your Bush, Claire. I haven't had it would just fucking zoo keeper keeper. Imagine your next door neighbor is a goddamn zookeeper. What the fuck, man, this is what you hear at night.

Speaker 10:         02:24:59       Oh, fucking noises.

Speaker 4:          02:25:21       The beast, the

Speaker 10:         02:25:24       woo.

Speaker 4:          02:25:27       The worst. Imagine you are in your Land Rover defender trying to get away from the encampment. You're driving away and you get a flat and you're like, what should we do? Well, we should definitely wait until the morning. We can't see. I don't have a light. We can't see. I can't change it. And then as you're sleeping in that fucking land rover here,

Speaker 10:         02:25:45       well, Hey,

Speaker 4:          02:25:51       you look out there, there's 30 of them with their paws on the fucking hood. And then you hear way, way, way in the distance, way the distance. Oh, that sound. Oh, they're all running. His guys explained it to me. Elephants, why they kill elephants? He's like, it's not. He goes, it's not just that people want to go over and trophy hunt these things. Sometimes the elephants will move into a village and these farmers, they have these plots of food for the village and it's all they have. And these elephants move in, just eat everything. It's not a goddamn thing they can do. There's nothing you could do. Nothing. They can do. The dinosaur, a dinosaur just came in and his way, he's been living forever. And you to start with spear and it is three of them or four of them, right? They're coming from every angle now, what the fuck are you going to do? And so you have all this, these vegetables are you growing for your family and you're fucked. How long did it take you to build his fucking hut? Gone. They just jacked seconds. It is Jackie. And if they think you're a threat in any way, they just eliminate that threat. Just go pick you up and throw you.

Speaker 11:         02:27:07       Yeah Dude,

Speaker 4:          02:27:10       go ahead. Get your spear. You see where you'll French just landed? Yeah, because I was arguing. I was like, what? Why would they ever need to kill an elephant? Like you don't ever need to kill an elephant. And Guy was like, oh actually here's what goes on. And I was like, oh. So they, they, they hire people to go and kill the elephant or they'll give someone a permit to kill the elephant. Then that person pays like 50,000 bucks or something like that and they'll come and kill the elephant. So some guy like that, those hunters, the fake hunters for that thing, they'll pose with it and you know, show the ivory and everything like that. And then they give all the meat to the village and then the village gets 50 grand. We get charged when I remember I was in Africa and the guy was like, listen, they don't did they never charge, they'll charge but it's always to spook you. And my nine year old, oh, it's in the cheap in front of us, uh, with another kid or whatever. And we came, we get, we were by a herd and as things turned around

Speaker 11:         02:28:13       and then

Speaker 4:          02:28:15       the one we thought was going to charge a different one charge, they called it a teenager. It ran and went right for kids. Jeep hit the cheese and then pushed it about 10 feet. And I went through everything where like it's going to knock over the vehicle and then just start smushing and this guy got out of the van and he just, he starts clapping, he's clapping, ah, bold about dope and a thing kinda stopped and shook his head and then went back off it. It was those things like, I can't imagine living there and just what you said because just that flash where the kid was just in a cheap that there was no stopping us this thing, once it started moving, there was no worry. Okay. You have like a two seconds to react. There is no, it's coming. It's coming. It's coming.

Speaker 4:          02:29:12       He was far away and within seconds he was on it and it just, I watched and shock. So they just don't want people driving through. Is that what it is? Duran was a territory and they also have, they've seen, they probably seen hunters, so they associate now chiefs is like, whoa. I was just thinking to shoot us. Well I don't care, but it lost my brother. I'm taking it out. They have crazy memories apparently. Yeah. This is, isn't that the vehicle that came when we were at the watering hole and he sliced my get it. Fuck. Getting good at it. You know, I don't see myself going over there. No, I think you'd like it. Abuse area. You were on a fucking spear hunt. Yeah, but it was awesome. Stay Buck. I think about that crazy. You here behind you honey, right through the fucking Cobra. Oh, see I didn't even think about stuff like that. The heck was I think some Cobra. Awesome. Funny.

Speaker 10:         02:30:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:30:18       Moons ass. So I can't really tell what it is. Imagine how fucked up you have to be to be a cobra. Mind. You Cook, you're growing poison in your head and you shoot it out of your teeth. You bite people and inject them. You are literally a walking needle. You're a needle. Yes. You're a walking overdose needle. A poison needle. Yeah. Poison needle and some of them use you just a hundred percent death. Some of them it's 100% like the, you know, I know people get bitten to make enough antivenom. You're never going to get it. Yeah. Everybody get in time. Yeah. Who's carrying that you carry with you everywhere. Only lasts a little while. Who is carrying that could keep making it. They make it with horses too. Do you know that what? Like rattlesnake venom? Antivenom. They shoot horses up with it. They, they take a rattlesnake in Jack rattlesnake venom and the horse, the, this, the horse curlex the antibodies produces antibodies and they take those antibodies out. And that's like the serum entheos really mean. At least they used to do

Speaker 4:          02:31:20       it that way. I'm pretty sure they still do though. I know it's, um, it's an issue for vegans because if vegans don't want to use any animal products and they get bitten by a snake, like they have to compromise. That has to be some, there has to be some compromise here. Yeah. I don't get, I don't get all that. I get it, but I don't get it. I get it. I get it. They want to be nice. They want to be righteous. It wouldn't be a good person. Is it nice? Is it the fight for matter? Cruelty in general, I think ultimately cruelties terrible. You know, the, our, our real problem is a factory farming. Our real problem is, uh, the cruelty to animals. It's not eating animals a real problem going because they're going to die. They're going to live, they're going to die.

Speaker 4:          02:32:02       And I know you can say that argument about people too. Why don't you see you be blue? Because people are people and we're different than cows. Okay. Yeah, but don't you see to tell you this? Listen, we all know this. Yeah. This is what I would say. We all know all of this. You can go to a factory and see it. He didn't go to any factor. Anything. Chickens, any Ame, everything you love. Write down the plants. Yup. Anything. It's all been manufactured. Well now what are you into? What are you can, you can just get a barking here. Down the street. Wear a sign. Yeah. At least pork. Chicken. Sure. I didn't really grasp ed where at the same time you're buying the tee shirt to watch the bread. No

Speaker 8:          02:32:46       show at home or you got about how many shares with we by today by ban and I died tonight and I'm fine.

Speaker 4:          02:32:54       Make America great again.

Speaker 8:          02:32:56       Hello? Hello. They're building walls in Wisconsin. They're building walls at North Dakota. They're building walls and half American.

Speaker 4:          02:33:14       The only way to keep the Mexicans out of each individual state is wall to wall off. If we want them all off, we can keep them from getting in. Once we find them, we have a mold off in the air, then we get them, we send them to Mexico. The only way he's not one wall. We need 50 walls in a wall over each individual state. That way we can contain anyone who causes a problem. First, we'll start with Mexicans and we'll work our way up to really a rude white people. If you wear any type of cloth around your head, you shall be

Speaker 8:          02:33:45       boss actually said, but what about do

Like what? And the guy was a reenactor is like the actor from I think thinner from the movie thinner with Stephen King and he's like a semi famous actor with, is that who it is? Because at the same guy it was all on the documentary. Yeah. He's, he plays the cop and the reenactments and it's like okay that's the guy who plays curt. But there was a guy who plays the detective. It's a weird documentary cause it's like, man, you can say anything you want in a documentary. If you use a bunch of reenactments and you're pretending that you were there while this happened. But people, yeah, you see my white coat? Yeah. It's a documentary. It's true. If I say documentary, we have a script. We have a story of ARD. It's reality.
