Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hello Ladies and gentlemen and, and people that prefer to be genderless. If you one of those, this is a new era, we have to be super sensitive to everybody. That's what queer is, right? You're like, I'm this, I'm that. Um, it um, this episode is brought to you by Ting Tang is a, I have a new tank phone by the way. I just got it. This is the official cell phone of this podcast and I got the Samsung Galaxy s five, which has a heart rate monitor built in young Jamie right there. You put your finger, it tells you shit about yourself, like you're fat or you're not fat or you're fucking awesome or you're going to die. And uh, tracks all sorts. It's like a, there's a fit program that comes with it. It's dope. I am officially a phone whore though. My third phone this year that makes me a phone horse and you know, how's, it's only only August, but I love technology.

Speaker 1:          00:00:54       I love it. Um, what Ting is, is a mobile service that uses the sprint backbone. And what they do is they use sprint but you don't go by sprints. Rules go by tings, rules and tings. Rules are incredibly beneficial to you. A 98% of people would save money with tank and they have no contracts, no early termination fees, no nothing, no bullshit. And you also don't pay a flat rate per month, which I like because most of the time you don't use all your minutes and it's kind of ridiculous. You know, you pay for 120 minutes, use 90 what happens is other 30 minutes, nothing that they're gone there in the ether next month, new cycle, 120 minutes. Again, Tim doesn't do it that way with Tang, you pay for what you use and I think it's the smartest way to do it. They have incredibly high rates ratings rather if you look online as far as like people that use ting, how much they loved them, they're like they're, they're applauded left and right and it's because the ethics of the company to extremely intelligent group of people that put together this plan.

Speaker 1:          00:01:58       They said, you know what? We can, you could still make a lot of money without fucking people over. And that's what they decided to do. A $21 is the average monthly bill per device for 10 customers. It's pretty sweet. Um, and they have all of the latest and greatest android phones. Like this one that I have right here, which is the Samsung Galaxy s five, which is, it's pretty dope. It's beautiful big five inch screen. It's awesome for going online and shit, but they have all the android phones and when you buy them from Tang, you own it. It's yours. That's it. If you're a cheapskate and you don't like spend a lot of money, you can get an iPhone four for just 95 bucks. Um, if you want to get the top of the line, you can get an iPhone five for only 250 bucks.

Speaker 1:          00:02:38       And when you pay that 250 bucks, you actually own it. When you buy a phone from most companies and say if you buy a phone and the phone says to 99, it's not really two 99 what it is, it's probably like 600 bucks, but you pay off the other 300 bucks over time. So if you try to cancel, they hit you with this fee. So what the fee is is every month they just tack on a little of the price of the phone to your bill. That's kind of stupid in my id, in my eyes. It's kind of ridiculous. You don't need to do it that way. And if you do it through Tang, you just buy the phone, you own it, cancel when you want and then be done with it. Uh, and if you go to rogan.ting.com you can save 25 bucks off of any of these beautiful devices.

Speaker 1:          00:03:17       Uh, it's an ethical company in awesome company. They have a great service. The sprint backbone is a fantastic network and you know, it's not like you're using a mom and pop cell phone company. You're using one of the major providers, you're using the same service that you get with sprint, but with tings, rules. I love it. And again, it is the official cell phone of this podcast and got one right in front of me, rogan.ting.com and that is the only commercial today. How about them apples, bitches, Abby Martins here. Why fuck around. Cue The music. Young Jamie,

Speaker 2:          00:03:52       the Joe Rogan experience by day Joe Rogan podcast by night all day. So

Speaker 1:          00:04:03       Mrs Rogan sends me this video, she goes, uh, have you seen this? Like what do you think about Gaza? What's going on with Gaza? What did, what do you, what is your take on this? And she sends me a video of you and I said, that's my friend Abby Martin who took this very controversial stance. And um, it's, it's a tricky situation, isn't it? Like Gaza is, first of all, it's sad and depressing and disgusting, but it's also very tricky because there's all this weird biases that, that are going on left and right. You know, there's the United States has this weird bias where they're criticizing Israel and Israel is like, Hey, fuck heads, didn't you guys bomb the shit out of Iraq and you bomb the shit out of Afghanistan. You guys are talking about innocent civilians being killed. Like what about you? And then there's also people on the Palestinian side that think it's just fucking horrendous what Israel is doing. And then there's people on the Israeli side that thank Hamas, just signed the peace treaty and stop training suicide bombers. You know, there's an, in my opinion, when I look at it and I am obviously not qualified to be some sort of a political analysts, but when I look at it, I try to look at it objectively. The whole thing looks like a just a disaster, like a huge humanitarian disaster.

Speaker 3:          00:05:21       I think it's one of the largest humanitarian issues in the world today. And I think that we're going to look back in 50 years and um, really just criticize how abominable the entire situation is and the fact that the world, the world isn't turning a blind eye, the US is turning a blind eye. Um, you know, you say that the, I took a controversial position, but really it isn't controversial in my mind because I'm looking at this oppressed population that's in prisoned. When I grew up, Joe, I didn't even know first of all what Palestine was. And then when finally when I learned about the Israeli Palestinian conflict, even though it's really one sided, um, I started to learn about what Gaza actually is. And I think a lot of people don't even understand when they hear the word Gaza what they're talking about, it's really what we're talking about is an open air prison.

Speaker 3:          00:06:04       45 mile strip of land completely closed off. Egypt's close their borders, cc's just fucking sucking the Dick of Netanyahu totally working together. Netanyahu's shut off. The IDF is closed off all the other boarders. It's totally under siege. There's 1.8 million people living in that close quarters. It's one of those densely populated places on earth. So whenever you have this bombing campaign, people are going to die and mass, and when they say that they're using human shields, that's complete fucking bullshit. I haven't seen one shred of evidence to prove that they're using human shields and fact, if you look back at the last 60 years of US military conflicts, they've used that term to demonize populations whenever they want to make it seem like this population doesn't value human life. You're telling me Palestinians don't value their child's life, that they're going to throw their kids out in guard missiles.

Speaker 3:          00:06:55       All I've seen is cartoons from, from Netanyahu, these infographics that show people standing on a house with missiles underneath total fucking bullshit. This place has been under siege for years. Yes. They may have said that they pulled their troops out in 2007 it's under siege. They, the Israeli health official said that there, they've tried to put them on a diet so they only allow basic staples in they claim because they didn't want the Palestinians to be making weapons. Pasta, paper, chocolate, anesthetics, wheelchairs. This is the shit that people can't get inside Gaza. They're keeping them gluten free.

Speaker 1:          00:07:32       It's been shown to reduce hostility. The, there was a documentary once on suicide bombings and uh, they had this Palestinian school and they had the sign over the school that said today's children are tomorrow's holy martyrs. And they had this child that was strapped up with a c four and they had this picture of this kid that had died in a suicide bombing and they were praising him like he was some sort of a, you know, a saint, you know, cause he died executing this.

Speaker 3:          00:08:01       So we'll just take, we praise soldiers who go and drop white phosphorous from plane. You know what, what's more manly? Like when you're, when you're driven to zero, when you have nothing left, that's when people blow themselves up. It's not because it's a culture of martyrdom, it's because they have fucking nothing and they don't have the industrial warfare capabilities to drop depleted uranium.

Speaker 1:          00:08:21       Right. Yeah. I'm certainly not taking a side. Right. But what I'm saying is that it's a, it's an incredibly complicated situation. Like A, I don't know what, what Israel do to, to like alleviate tension to this point once, like how many thousands of people have died so far over 1500 at this 1500. She's just Christ. 30% children. I've seen photos. Anthony Bordain tweeted some awful photo of these children on the beach that had been bombed and one kid was dad and the other kid was being carried away, most likely dead. It looked like by all the blood and everything. It was just, it's, it's so depressing. It's so awful. And if you, if you could objectively stop the whole scene and say, what is a way to fix this? What is a way to alleviate this, this horrible conflict? What is it? Is there a way?

Speaker 3:          00:09:16       Well, I think up until now people have been saying that two state solutions a possibility or you had the Palestinian Authority working with the Israeli government. Hamas has negotiated before. It's not that they're like ignoring Israel. Um, and of course there's a lot of problems with the moss and I'm not gonna sit here and apologize for them. They're really, I don't, I don't agree with anything that they want to see happen, but I understand why Palestinians have aligned themselves with this group because the Palestinian Authority failed so much and they could pitch related so much to Israel. So they basically turned to the more militant faction of the leadership saying, fucking do something. At least you guys are resisting. Because to them it's an occupation and under the UN charter it's an occupation as well. A lot of people say the one state solution is the only possibility which is end the apartheid state give Palestinians equal rights because right now there's different laws if you're Arab, that's what Israel is.

Speaker 3:          00:10:05       It's a Jewish state and they've driven out people who are not Jewish and they're ethnically cleansing them. It's a fucking disaster, man. It's really scary. And I don't actually blame Israelis because you're growing up in Israel, first of all, they think that they're the chosen people because the Bible says so, which is disturbing in itself. But second of all, if you're growing up in Israel and you do hear the sirens all the time and you fucking think you're being told that these people are terrorists and they want to kill you. Right? Um, so I mean, I don't blame it and, and, but, but honestly Israel has much more fair media coverage. They have hearts. They have nine seven two mag here in America. We're treated like fucking children. We aren't told the context of the situation whatsoever. All we're told is Hamas terrorists keep firing it. Israel and Israel has the right to self defense.

Speaker 1:          00:10:50       Well, in all fairness, this is a topic that's really too complicated for the news in quotes. You're not going to get in a fox seven minute sound bite in between commercials. This is something that's incredibly complex and really should be like a three or four hour documentary just to scratch the surface. And I don't know if, I mean, I guess if you call yourself the news, there's a responsibility, at least an implied responsibility to educate when it comes to a situation like this. But to try to cover it on Fox News or on CNN and to try to like give an understanding to the people viewing it seems almost impossible,

Speaker 3:          00:11:28       but they also just only do pro Israel minus like that's why I did that video. Why doesn't the media care about dead Palestinians? Because up until there was like hundreds of Palestinians that had died already and the news was still making it seem like, like literally every single headline was just like three Israeli soldiers died, 400 others and you're like, who are others? Palestinians like human beings like fuck. Are these people or would just be like Israel's, you know Hamas rockets have Israel on edge. It's like, yeah, they had, they might have Israel on edge, but people are fucking like dying and getting dismembered and getting blown up like from bombs and all this cease fire Shit, man. Look, Aye, you're invading a country. They are invading Gaza. Netanyahu also said it doesn't matter, ceasefire fire or not, they're going to go through with the invasion and destroyed the tunnels.

Speaker 3:          00:12:14       The tunnels are not just used to store rockets. The tunnels are used to smuggle food into Gaza. The tunnels are used to smuggle people out to try to get them into Egypt because they're wounded and injured on the news. It is disgusting. I've never seen anything so discussing in my life than the bias toward Israel on the media. And I know I'm called so many names because I'm pointing this out, but to me it's very obvious. My friend right here, she's from South Africa. She fucking, you know, she grew up in a culture of post apartheid. And we're living in a world where an apartheid state exists right now. And because of this tight allegiance with the u s the u s supplies over $3 billion a year, and just weaponry, we're continuing to give more weapons to Israel unless the US says something, nothing's going to change. And because it's this Jewish state, if you criticize it, then you must hate Jewish people. And that's the problem is this rhetoric. And it's so hard to break through and to explain to people, look, because I'm criticizing the government doesn't mean that I hate the population. I love all human beings. I just want them to have sovereignty, independence and equal rights.

Speaker 1:          00:13:18       Well, there's also this undeniable problem with having an area like that in what the problem is, is that they're going to be children that are born in that area, that have no history of conflict whatsoever, and they're fucked. They're fucked. This is where they live now and they're treated as the enemy and they're born into that and there's no chance to break that cycle. And that sort of a scenario. If you have a closed border, you have a closed in population and you have this demonized population, there's no chance to break that struggle. I mean, if you're a child and you're born in Palestine, what the fuck are the options? Where are you going? What's going on your, and what are the ideologies that you're confronted with constantly left and right when you've got Hammas, you've got all these Palestinian organizations that want to fight against Israel and, and you know you're growing.

Speaker 1:          00:14:09       You're growing up in this state of perpetual conflict with it. It doesn't seem like there's any resolution that's conceivable. It's, it's a terrible, terrible tragedy. It as far as like the wasted human potential of the children that are born. They're the people that are forced to grow up in that environment as opposed to Israel where they could just fucking fly out and leave and live there. And you know, I mean, I, I'm not, you know, I'm 100% against war. 100%. Um, I don't think that wars, the option here. I don't think it's correct. I don't think, I never think it's correct. The only time it's ever, I think the only time the military should ever be used is when there's an obvious threat. You got some isis crazy fucks are something that are invading in a country and having mass executions like what we're, we're dealing with right now in Iraq.

Speaker 1:          00:14:59       That to me is a way clear example of something that probably needs some fucking military tension than anything that they use to justify going to war with Iraq in the first place. Like what they've created in this vacuum is way scarier. We're pulling out now while it's not our problem. No, that's a real problem. This is a real problem with you. Fuckers. Did as you created a problem, you created a power vacuum and now there's a real problem because now you've got militants who are so militant that regular Islam is not militant enough for them. They're blown up mosques. These fuckers are blowing up. Like these got training from the Syrian

Speaker 3:          00:15:36       holes that we gave them. So it's like we embolden the Syrian rebels that were aligned with this really radical faction of Islam and then they join up with Isis and now they're going back to fucking Iraq. And you're like, what in the hell? This is why we shouldn't get involved. This is why we shouldn't go inject democracy in places that are completely on a different evolutionary path of, you know, culture.

Speaker 1:          00:15:53       Duncan and I had dinner last night after the show and we were talking about this and we're both like shaking her head. And one of the things that we kept coming to is like when ever you have military action, whenever you kill a thousand people, you don't just kill a thousand people. You also make widows, you make loved ones who hate the lost their friends and family. And there's just this, this culture of hate that just never goes away. It's, it's as long as the, yeah, as long as those people are alive, this cycle is just ingrained in them on both sides, on the Israeli side, on the Palestinian side, it's just horrific. And it's almost like this, this process that's impossible to completely stop. Like once the blood is shed, like, fuck man. It's like, you know, it just, it creates, this is

Speaker 3:          00:16:39       unfixable problem. I see it and it, okay. So we created this Jewish state, the US help create this Jewish state Israel. Um, then there was, you know, the anti photos and then they had their borders. And basically what's happened is that Israel has continued to encroach and if you look at the math, there's like this map. This is very famous picture of these four factions of how Israel has encroached more and more in Palestine. And now it just closed off. More and more. Gaza's just shrunk to about this big. The westbank has shrunk to about this big and they continue to build settlements against international law. They've violated all of these like international treaties to continue doing this because more and more settlers are going over there and, and making a home base, demolishing homes left and right. Um, so if you look at the conflict, it depends on when you want to start the clock.

Speaker 3:          00:17:31       You can start it with the kidnappings, which Hamas actually didn't do in Israel, had to admit to that. Or you can start with the two kids that were executed on camera by IDF soldiers weeks prior to that. Or You could start with fucking 50 years ago or you could start with fucking 3000 years ago. I mean, when, when you want to start the conflict or the clock, the conflict and not really all depends on the context of the situation, but when people say like, well, you're fucking shooting rockets at us, what do you think we're going to do? The problem is you have to understand why they're shooting rockets and no one wants to talk about that. And no one wants to talk about how if you have a helpless population under section 51 under the UN Charter, that if you're getting fucking peddled with industrial warfare and you don't have an army and your help us population being occupied, you do have the right to defend yourself.

Speaker 3:          00:18:16       That's the UN. Um, I'm not, I abhor violence on either side and I completely condemn shooting rockets into civilian populations and uh, trying to kill people. But I do understand the resistance movement. I do understand people aligning with Hamas because look, they're under fucking siege. And if I didn't have basic amenities and if I saw my home, like my neighbor's homes getting demolished all my life and I five fucking saw people getting shot and beat the shit out of all my Palestinian friends friends here who have left Palestine over the years, their stories are just unbelievable. One of them's brother was beaten to death by the IDF when he was 16 because he threw a stone. The other one lost six family members and one bombing. And I'm just like, how the fuck do you guys go on? And they're like, just surviving. Is our resistance just living as our resistance? I mean, I, and everyone has a story like that.

Speaker 4:          00:19:09       The end, there's incredible biases. Um, on the side of the, the pro Israel side. Like, I've, I've seen some videos that make you just go w w w what the Dennis Prager one is the most egregious if you ever seen them. Now what is it? We'll play. It will play it because it's quite fascinating. I'm Dennis Prager on the Palestine, um, uh, Israeli conflict. It's like he, he breaks it down in this way that like, uh, it's, it's very, it's a highly criticized video. Um, in a nutshell. Yes. Yes. Let's play it. Let's do it because it's a, it's one of those ones where you're like, okay, come on man. Uh, well I'll, I'll, we'll play it here. You got it. Because it's something that you can't really describe without actually, cause Dennis Prager is this like serious, conservative Jewish Fella, right? Prager university. By the way, you can't have Prager university. You're fuck, you know, you're not a God damn professor of a university that you,

Speaker 5:          00:20:11       Oh, a Prager university is you give us five minutes and we'll give you a semester. Well, I took many more stories on the question of the Middle East conflict. I was at the Middle East Institute. In fact, that Columbia University, that's where I did my graduate work semester after semester discussing the Middle East conflict as if it were the most complex conflict in the world, when in fact it's probably the easiest conflict in the world to describe. It may be the hardest to solve, but it really is the easiest to describe kill all Muslims. And really in a nutshell, this is what it is. Israel would like to and recognizes the right of the Palestinians to have a state. The Palestinians, however, and many other Muslims and Arabs do not recognize the right of a Jewish state of Israel to exist. Every poll among Palestinians shows that the majority of Palestinians want there to be no Jewish state of Israel doesn't believe that it should exist or had any basis for being.

Speaker 5:          00:21:10       And this has been true since 1948 when the British left and the UN established eight division Palestine will be cut in half Jewish half and an Arab. Half the Jews accepted it. The Arabs didn't accept it. And what happened the moment it was announced, Arab armies about seven Arab armies attacked the Jewish state in order to destroy it. To everybody's surprise, the little Jewish state survive. And that was pretty much it. And then it happened again in 1967 when the dictator of Egypt Gamal Abdel Nasser said, we are now going to extinguish the Jewish state of Israel. And Jordan joined him and Syria joined him, but Israel attack first. And so Israel survive. And that is how Israel and only that way came to occupy what was called the West Bank of Jordan, where many Palestinians live because many Palestinians lived in that part of Jordan. So the war was over in 67 and a lot of the Arabs do.

Speaker 5:          00:22:08       The Arab states all went to Khartoum Sudan and announced no recognition, no peace and no negotiations. The three famous knows what was Israel supposed to do. Then Israel made an agreement to give the entire Sinai peninsula and area of land bigger than Israel with oil back to Egypt because they said they would make peace with Israel. Israel gives territory back for peace and it will always do that, but is there really a desire for peace on the part of Israel's enemies, which broadcast after broadcast on TV and radio and the Palestinian areas is about how Jews should be killed and how a law once a Jews to be killed. That's the typical broadcast on Palestinian television, so it's not hard to explain the Middle East dispute. One side wants the other debt. You know what the motto of Hamas is? The motto of Hamas is we love death as much as the Jews love life.

Speaker 5:          00:23:09       Now you tell me how was this real supposed to make peace when people believe what? Hamas beliefs. Oh God, where do I start now? Here is one of the most important thing nobody talks about. Everybody talks about a Palestinian state. Why didn't anybody talk about a Palestinian state while the Palestinians lived on the Jordanian rule? Because the truth is people started talking about a Palestinian state once the Palestinians were under Israeli rule because it was always a way to destroy the Jewish state of Israel and I saved you were state because that's what it is. There are many, many Arab states, but there was only one Jewish state. It is about the size of New Jersey. In fact, Israel is the size of El Salvador, El Salvador, and yet if a Martian came to the earth and they visited the United Nations newspapers or watched the world television, they would believe that the biggest problem on earth is a state the size of New Jersey and El Salvador.

Speaker 5:          00:24:09       This state of Israel, this preoccupation with a little democratic humane state is absolutely irrational. And here's another question to be asking. If Israel tomorrow put down its arms and said, we will fight no more, what would happen if the Arab countries around Israel said, we will fight no more. We put down our arms. What would happen in the first case? There would be an immediate destruction of the state of Israel with mass murder of the Jews of Israel. In the second scenario I presented where the Arabs put down their arms and said, we just want peace. They would be the next Wednesday. The fact is, as I said at the outset, it is a very simple problem to describe. One side wants the other debt and if they didn't, there would be peace and yet please remember this. There has never been never in the history of the world a state in that area, in what is called geographically Palestine that was not Jewish. Israel is the third autonomous Jewish state to exist in that area. There was never on autonomous Arab state. There was never an autonomous Muslim state. There was never an autonomous, any other state. That's the issue. Why can't a little state the size of El Salvador that calls itself Israel be allowed to exist? That in a nutshell is the Middle East problem. I'm Dennis Prager.

Speaker 3:          00:25:41       Dennis Prager is a Douche bag. I love how he's like, um, okay, so you have all these Arab states and this is the only Jewish state. Arab isn't a fucking religion idiot Jewish state. Yeah, you have an Islamic state of Iran, but are you going to really compare the fucking too, if you're claiming that Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East, are you really comparing yourself to Iran and all these other like, I mean it's just amazing that he just said that. That's insane also. Sure. There's absolutely people who hate Jewish people. There's calls for genocide on that side, but there's also calls for genocide and the Israeli cabinet as well. Some woman just said that all Palestinians should die. Times of Israel just published a piece justifying genocide. They actually said when justify when genocide is permissible. This was just published yesterday, taken down, um, in a couple of hours because of the backlash.

Speaker 3:          00:26:31       But you have this, this rhetoric coming from both sides, but I only see one side actually doing the genocide carrying out genocide. Um, one side is doing the killing the other side. Yes. Hamas charter may say that Israel should seize to exist. I don't know if that's like a mistranslation in Arabic of just saying the state should be dissolved, but I know that they missed translated document. Dennis shod saying wipe Israel off the map. He never actually said that. Um, he just, he said like the borders should like Israel as a state shouldn't be there as a Jewish state. He didn't say fucking wipe them off the map, killed them all. That was a mistranslation. And of course you just hear that repeated ad nauseum no matter what. Um, one other thing that's just really ridiculous is this other Israeli cabinet official just said that Palestinians are committing self genocide. That every time the Palestinian child dies it's because they're killing themselves. I guess there must be rockets inside of these children because I haven't seen any evidence whatsoever. All the homes of they're blowing up. Where are these rocket command centers? I just want to see fucking evidence. It's not a cartoon.

Speaker 1:          00:27:32       Well, Prager's uh, his point of views, very simplified, very simplistic and biased. Obviously, you know, his, the, the whole take like it's very simple. The Jewish state. It's very simple. It's not very simple. It's not simple at all, man. And he didn't mention what you mentioned at all is that these people are kind of closed in there and there's no hope for them. This idea that, you know, first of all, the idea that a Jewish state has always gives a fuck. It's religions retarded. All right, if you're an old man, you think religions are good idea, good on you buddy. Keep that rock that shit until you fucking body stops working. But for us, for the young folks that are out here that had sort of paying attention to the way things have run on this planet in this idiotic cyclical manner, from the beginning of time, from the beginning, the first fucking dude wrote shit down and decided to tell the other guys that God wrote it or God told him to write it or what.

Speaker 1:          00:28:32       I mean, that's it. This idea that it's the religious state should be allowed to exist. The idea of a religious state is ridiculous. It's ridiculous. Whether it's a state of Scientology, whether it's the moonies have their own fucking country. Like any country that is based on religion. It's ridiculous. It's ridiculous. And I know we're supposed to have religious freedom and I agree with that. I agree that you should fucking, you should be able to worship the spaghetti monster. You should be able to do whatever you want. But when you have an entire state that bling believes it's the chosen people and they're connected to this other state that they have sort of boxed into this 45 mile strip, I mean objectively stand outside of the situation. What are those poor people you're supposed to do? You know, and look, I'm, I am not discounting this idea that Hamas is a terrorist organization cause they obviously are, but how, how does a terrorist organizations start out?

Speaker 1:          00:29:35       It's like one of the things that happened during September 11th it drove me fucking bananas when George Bush was like, they hate us for our freedom, you know? Okay. W W w they hate us so much for our freedom that they're willing to fly planes into buildings. What did we do right? What the fuck are we doing that gets people angry? Nobody ever thinks about that. All they ever think about is the action themselves. Not like what's causing this action? What is it that's making people come from another planet and blow up buildings in New York City? Well, it's not New York City. It's not those people. It's not the people in those busy not freedom. It's not freedom. It has nothing to do with it. It's this discounting of the chain of events that cause this cataclysmic disaster. It's discounting the, the, the pressures, the, the inequities, the, the, all the problems, the inequality, tha tha tha tha the despair of being born into that situation and this is the idea that what the thing that drives me the most crazy about war is that people will agree that those people are the enemy.

Speaker 1:          00:30:39       People that they don't even know, right? They're just people. This, this, this concept of tribalism is so archaic and so fucking stupid that it, it drives me crazy that it still exists. That in this day and age, people who have never met, we'll see someone who's on the other side of the fence and say, that is my enemy and I have to go kill them. People who have never met, they don't know each other at all. And this idea that these people are Arab and these people are Jewish, so they could never possibly get a wrong. It's preposterous saying it exists all throughout this country. We w people, I mean, yeah, there's racism and there's there, there's biases against religions and religious beliefs for sure. But there's also, there's always going to be that there's bias against Republicans hate fucking Democrats. Democrats hate Republicans, but a lot of people hate libertarians. People love to hate people for all regardless.

Speaker 6:          00:31:33       And when the media is amplifying that hate and telling you more reasons why you should hate the, it's the same logic. Okay, so Hamas is the democratically elected leadership of the Gaza Strip. And the reason is because of what I said before, is that they're aligning more with this militant faction because they are trying to resist this occupation and ongoing seizure. Right. I disagree with Hamas is all of what they stand for. But I understand the evolution of how this happened, but it's the same logic as saying all Palestinians deserve to die because they liked it. Hamas. They all must be terrorist. They almost believe in that shit. It's the same logic bin Ladin had that Americans deserve to die because you know of what we did, right? Because we elected these leaders who you could say are terrorists. I'm just a larger scale. What makes someone a terrorist? Killing a million Iraqis with all this fucking high grade weaponry or blowing yourself up on an airplane. I mean it's comparable. If you're looking at, I would say that the a million daddy Rockies would say that Bush was a terrorist. You know, one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter.

Speaker 1:          00:32:30       Yeah. It's easy to point. It's easy to decide that someone's a terrorist and that will label terrorist is such a right. It's so vague and it's so easy. Move around. You know, he could, he could apply it to either side,

Speaker 3:          00:32:42       but the dehumanization of populations. My brother Robbie Martin, he's yelled, he does journalism for media roots.org, which is my other citizen journalism website. But we just published this article about the history of the term human shield and it just, it is really incredible because you look back at even World War II, Japan, the Vietcong, we all use this terminology and there's really little evidence to ever back it up. And it always is when the establishment wants to paint a population as like having little value to human life, even bin Ladin using as wives as human shields. When we raided the compound that turned out to be an ally, um, the Taliban, they said that they use people as human shields shooting from civilian areas. All of this like never really has been proven, but when you repeat it more and more and more and more, people just say like, oh, well they're using their kids as human shields.

Speaker 3:          00:33:29       What are we supposed to do when we go in there and bomb them? Like, it's not our fault that the kids are dying. Here's isn't even fucking crazier part. As you remember this, when we invaded Iraq Bush, actually, so the CIO has this giant document on human shields and Saddam is use of human shields. And Bush actually fucking had the audacity to go out on TV and say, just to warn you, there's going to be mass casualties when we invaded Iraq. And he was like, but it's going to be because he Rockies are going to be used as human shields. He was like, the people who die, Saddam, we'll be using them as human shields. Like how the fucking insane is that the, you're preemptively justifying slaughter by blaming the population that you're going to be bombing. I sorry, I just get really upset. Well, you

Speaker 1:          00:34:07       shouldn't be. You should be, because these tactics are ridiculous. You know, and this, these, these tactics, they're a part of an ancient system, right? This ancient system of justification of warfare and this ancient system, it really, you know, for the longest time it was incredibly difficult to decipher. Incredibly difficult. I mean, go back to the Roman days, try to figure out who's right and who's wrong. Good luck. What are you going to find the right animal skin to read? You know where it has the fucking truth written down on it? No, you, you couldn't possibly be there when the events transpired that caused the war itself. You couldn't possibly be in the tent where the, the, the war chiefs decided to fucking, you know me. This is the attack we're going to do and this is the reason why we're going to do it. No, you, you just were a part of the army or you are part of the civilian population that had to endure whatever was going on.

Speaker 1:          00:34:58       You felt powerless. You felt you had no information other than what was being spread through the state and you were fucked. But now we live in this different time and in this different time you can watch a Dennis Prager video and go Dennis Prager as a Douche bag. You can debate it. You can, you can look at the actual facts of the situation and people can be informed in a way that's really never been available before. The, the Vietnam war protests were largely based on the, there were largely based on educational institutions. It was largely largely based out of universities where these liberal professors were trying to explain to people what the reality of the situation was. And then parents are like, these fucking liberals are teaching my kids bullshit. And then you had Kent state where the fucking the military, the national guard came in and shot student protestors and scare the fuck out of everybody. I mean there was so much chaos going on to try to suppress the spread of information. Just tried to suppress dissent. But today the wells broken. I mean it's just, there's no suppressing it any more. And we have these organizations that are scrambling to try to make sense of it all that trying to justify their actions in, in light of this overwhelming amount of information that didn't exist before.

Speaker 3:          00:36:17       Exactly. Social media, the wouldn't during operation cast lead, which was I think I want to say 2009 but that was the last really brutal siege on Gaza and we didn't have social media like we did. I'm in, they didn't have it back then like we do now. So I think they're able to control the narrative a little bit more. But now it's like the fucking floodgates are opened. Dude. You can't deny seeing children's brains being blown out. I mean it's just, there's so much death and destruction on social media that you're just seeing the truth right in your fucking face. It doesn't matter how many cartoon infographics you make up on the IDF sided and going back to propaganda, I mean Israel is just working 24, seven to try to spin this thing. Um, not only as our media an abysmal failure and relaying what is actually happening, but they actually have, um, you know, first of all, there's the birthright trip where actually I think like 2000 soldiers right now and the idea for American, because they go on these birthright trips and then they're told at the end of the trip, like, come fight for us like you need this is like everyone wants to kill us still.

Speaker 3:          00:37:18       You know, Jews need protection and come join the IDF. And it's just bizarre. I can't imagine another army, well actually I can, and they were called terrorists when people wanted to join like the Iraqi resistance and the Syrian resistance, we call them terrorists. But if you're an American, you go fucking join the IDF, which is a colonial army. Somehow you're a fucking hero. The propaganda machines working 24 seven, they offer grants, scholarships for people who can do the most pro Zionist editing on Wikipedia and edit the most Facebook posts and post the most pro tweets, pro Israel treats. They offer free hotter balloon rides around Israel. Tel Aviv. If you post the most pro Israeli shit on like Facebook and Twitter. Dude, it's pretty sweet though. Hot Air balloon who we didn't want to do that. Right. I'm thinking about it and I mean I doubt Hamas is offering, like I've dropped him off with the capability to offer that to, to the all the fucking human shields in Gaza, but I don't even have pasta or chocolate. Yeah, they're going to have hot air balloons. They can't even make terrorist paper airplanes point to paper. Uh, but it just shows you how much is going into the spin machine on one side. And I was invited on CNN last night and I was like shocked. I was like, holy fuck, they're gonna let me go on CNN and drop this truth on there. And then they cancelled. I think they got some pressure, um, because it was too good to be, yeah. Oh,

Speaker 4:          00:38:36       good googly Mowgli. Of course they did. Yeah. Someone was probably like, no, no, no, no, no. Watch her videos, bitch crazy. Got a nose ring.

Speaker 1:          00:38:49       Yeah. Um, it's, this is a strange time when it comes to this, uh, these, these sort of events because they don't play out the way the military leaders sort of expect them to play out in the media anymore because the media that's online is as big, if not bigger in total. Then the mainstream in quotes media, there's no mainstream media anymore. There's CNN, there's Fox, there's these traditional media outlets, which is the way to describe them. Traditional media. It's almost like they're their legacy. It's like legacy media. But then there's online media, which if you totaled up the amount of blogs, the amount of videos, the amount of online websites that have streaming video and podcasts and the different forms of media that exists that cover these same issues. It's overwhelmingly bigger. Overwhelmingly like the numbers are much larger for the cumulative total of websites that cover these stories. It's, it's much more people are downloading like clicking on those links, reading those stories, watching those videos. Then you're getting ever on a CNN broadcast.

Speaker 6:          00:40:02       So that's why I didn't even care when they canceled it. I was like, fuck it, I'm going on Joe Rogan's show tomorrow. And that has a million times more. Just like people who I would even want to be reaching out to you. Like what do I want to reach out to like old ladies in their home watching fucking Fox or do I want to reach out to people who actually, you know, have that are on the ball or like invested in the culture and what the fuck's happening in this country. And that's your audience. And it's just really cool. I mean being at your show last night and seeing and seeing, just like how many people give a shit and are paying attention to you and the podcast and fuck CNN it, we're driving them into a relevancy man. I mean your show and all the social media stuff, these people, it's dinosaurs.

Speaker 4:          00:40:40       There's not dying. The silent movies, what it is, the format is archaic, you know, we'll be right back. You know, and like these fucking things drive me crazy when they have a legitimate issue to debate and they have four squares. Like it's the fucking Hollywood squares and rip is up in the corner and he's like this. That's correct. Right. Chase is nuts. And then you know, you have all these other people and they're yelling over each other and like we'll be right back. Thank you for, yeah, we have to cut to Justin Bieber. He just got it

Speaker 6:          00:41:08       court and that's what they actually did. They like cut from a congress. I mean I think CNN or something was cutting and he was talking to a congressman about the NSA and then they're like, hold on, breaking news, Justin Bieber. Just like pled something. I was like, what? Yeah. Um, yeah, I mean if I could just say one thing, so people don't call me a Nazi and shit is that I, I love all people. I think all human beings, I just want to see humanity have equality and I just think that the Palestinians are being royally fucked over and I'm just totally disgusted with the way that it's being portrayed and that they're being vilified and demonized with zero context and zero historical context of how this happened. And that's why I'm just like trying to just say as much as I can, even though I'm very biased and openly biased. I'm an advocacy journalist and I just think that it needs to be done because I see just a giant void in the main stream and I just got to fucking do it. I mean, I interviewed some woman in Gaza who she was just like, I could be called the human shield because I'm refusing to leave my house. And she's like, and the truth is there's nowhere for us to go. Yeah, we can't leave. Right.

Speaker 1:          00:42:10       45 miles and that many people stuffed in together. It's the, the options are incredibly limited. And if you really want to do, if anybody in that area really wants to have peace, this idea that you contain these people, it was almost like insuring, yeah, you're ensuring that you're going to have some sort of conflict, constant conflict. I don't know what to do though, but I mean, what are you gonna do? You're gonna let those people, if you let those people out of Gaza, okay. Like say if the, the, the, the, the Jews and the Palestinians come to an agreement and then they open the borders and then the Palestinians come over to Israel and they seek revenge for their family members that have died. And then it all starts all over again. I mean, once thousands of people have been killed and it sends in their eyes murdered, you know, you can say military action. It's call, you know, use whatever noises with your face to describe a missile hitting a fucking baby. But it is what it is. And if that's my baby, I'm strapping some c four to my chest and I'm going to find out who did it and I'm going to take out the whole group. I mean that's probably what they're thinking. And there's going to be a lot of those people. There's a lot of those people that are filled with despair. And what other options? I don't know. I don't know.

Speaker 6:          00:43:18       Good point. And I think that's the reason why these 120 people are still languishing, innocent and getting though, because at this point they're like, what the fuck are we going to do release these people? We just tortured them for 12 years.

Speaker 4:          00:43:27       Well, we tortured some folks. We tortured to boat. Did you see that fucking thing? Oh my God. Folks, if you haven't seen it folks, ladies and gentlemen, there is a recent thing where Barack Obama is talking. Okay

Speaker 1:          00:43:41       bout people being tortured and he uses the term. Well, we tortured some folks after the September 11 attacks.

Speaker 4:          00:43:51       Tortured some folks. No, you can't say that. You can say, we met some folks, you know, ah, we went to, we went to Atlanta. We met some Nice folks. You don't say we tortured some folks. Like what kind of fucking weird euphemism speak is that we tortured some folks. So that's become a Hashtag on Twitter now. A Hashtag we tortured some folks Hashtag drone king. Yeah, that is what's going on that I'm not kidding. That is uh, that's trending Hashtag we tortured some folks. I'm not kidding.

Speaker 6:          00:44:21       And that's exactly, yeah, that's exactly what, what's happening with the drone wars that look, these, these fucking Taliban militants just took over this airport and Karachi killed a shitload people. And why? Because they said that a drone fucking killed one of their leaders in fucking the rural area of Pakistan because Obama launched a drone attack. Killed this guy. It's like this is going to be going on forever. When you kill people with drones, when you fucking in prison, people a in a little area. I mean, it just going to be a cycle of violence and revenge and a hate. Um, and that's why I just completely disagree with, with, you know, of course the drone war. I disagree with all that Shit, man. Oh, bonds are there.

Speaker 1:          00:45:01       It's a spooky idea that you're nowhere near there and you have a remote control and you press a button and missiles that are called a hell fire. Missiles come flying out of the sky and slamming a targets often the wrong ones. And if you look at the amount of people that are innocent that had been killed by drones versus the amount of actual terrorists that have been killed by drunk, what a fucking mess that up.

Speaker 6:          00:45:25       And they also just call a militants. Anyone who's just aged like literally military age. So it could be 15 to fucking a hundred if you're a military age male, you're considered a militant. So who are, I mean, yeah, I don't know who's even like, I'm sure the majority of them are civilians. If you, if you have enough dirt on someone where you actually, they're worthy of being executed, put them on fucking trial. I'm sorry. But I believe in the rule of law and justice. I don't believe in just assassinating motherfuckers across the globe with zero accountability, zero context of who these people are. And we know that they've executed fucking like that. 16 year old boy, the son of Anwar, all all Locky. Yeah. 16 year old kid blew him up in a drone. Him and his whole family just dead. No accountability, no rationale and you know there are just all terrorists. I guess that's just makes us feel better. I guess to think that in Pakistan alone

Speaker 1:          00:46:16       between 416 and 951 civilians including hundred and 68 to 200 children have been killed depending upon reports and you know, who knows what the numbers, the correct numbers are. I mean first of all you got a real problem with incredibly poor people where you hit a fucking house where they live in and there's no paperwork and there are blown to smithereens. Like how many people were there. You were going to have to find the family members are going to report and tell you how many, and it's, you know, that's why you're getting these weird numbers, but the bottom line is hundreds of people have been murdered that did.

Speaker 6:          00:46:53       And also more disturbing linked to disturbing things. One of them, the intercept release, which is Glenn Greenwald's publication with the NSA leaks that they actually are killing people based on metadata. So they track someone's metadata through their cell phone and then they track all these patterns. So it's not even like real human beings with an, you know, conducting intelligence on the ground, figuring out what people deserve to die or not. It's actually fucking tracking metadata on a fucking like computer screen. That is insane to me because what if you give your cell phone or your grandma, right, the cell phones in your grandma's house or a church, they're going to fucking blow the shit out of that church. Exactly. Blow your grandma targeting wherever that phone, you know,

Speaker 7:          00:47:30       if you really hated somebody, you just leave your phone over their house. Hell, fire is a comment. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:47:36       that's specific. And so the idea of the, this is the word that gets thrown around a lot, surgical strikes. I mean you want to talk about surgical precision. You don't usually talk about missiles that hit metadata

Speaker 7:          00:47:49       that where a phone is and it's a hit in a fucking apartment building. You're just going to blow up. Whoever happens to random Billy be near this phone, collateral damage man. And going back to what do we do? I mean, I think that we, um, we end the apartheid state. We start giving Arabs equal rights, but I think that the u s cutting off funding militarily, I think is the number one thing. I mean, for God's sake, there's been blatant war crimes that have happened hitting the UN refugee school, killing 17 human beings that we're trying to get refuge during a humanitarian sees far, they bombed a crowded market, killing another 17. They've killed like six journalists, target all these media centers at, and then there was a UN Security Council where every single country either abstained or voted to investigate war crimes in Gaza except the u s except the u s that's how blind, that's how blind this allegiances. And if we could just end this military funding, I think then Israel would be forced to kind of analyze their, their role. And we can really talk seriously about solutions here because it's not going to work.

Speaker 1:          00:48:47       Yeah. You're not anti Israel, you're anti war right. You know, and I have a lot of friends that are Jewish and you know, on a lot of them have very strong opinions about this whole thing. And you know, I see it from their point of view. They grew up with this idea that the Palestinians are terrorists or the Palestinians kidnap, choose. And you remember the Olympic Games and all this craziness. And you know, I see their point of view. But as an objective human observer, when you watch us, you go, there has gotta be a way to break this cycle. And the way is not missiles and it's not blowing up tunnels. And it's not keeping these people on a strip of land. I don't know what the way is. You know, that's the problem. I'm talking a lot of shit here. I don't have any solutions, but uh, it's scary.

Speaker 1:          00:49:31       It's scary as fuck. And then you've got Russia that may be invading Ukraine right now. I mean, as we speak this weekend, that might be going down. You know, there's a bunch of points all over the earth where there's some scary shit that's happening. You know, it's, this is scary time. It's a very scary time because human beings have so much more capacity for violence. We, we the, our ability, when you have things like drones, when you have things like long range missiles and nuclear weapons and all these different things that just didn't exist a hundred years ago, but you still have the same mentality that existed a hundred years ago. That's the real issue, right? I mean, a hundred years ago, you know, you had a fucking get in a boat and you had to get over there in a plane with a propeller and it was, it was hard to fuck shit up. Now you can be in Nevada, you know, with a fucking x box controller and you're launching missiles, you know, from the other side of the world

Speaker 4:          00:50:28       is it gets real weird when it becomes easy to kill. And when you're so delusional that you think that you are literally chosen by God to live more than another human being, and then you have these weapons in your arsenal. That's what's scary to me. That's goofy as fuck. That is unbelievably goofy. And that's the thing that, you know, when you, when you talk to Jewish people, that's, you know, that's my faith and my undeniable right to have this faith. And that's why Dennis Prager, boy, my face, like undeniable, right? For a Jewish state, look, undeniably, there's so much fucking antisemitism online. It's disgusting. It's vile. And there's obviously Jews had been persecuted horribly in the past and um, you know, it's awful, but it's not a reason or justification to do this to another population. No, no, it's not. And it's only gonna make more antisemitism.

Speaker 4:          00:51:17       So unfortunate attacking Palestinians and seen and having the outside world look at this happen and you know, and also look, when Palestinians attack Israelis, that shit ain't helping either, man. Right? But it's, it's a terribly imbalanced situation, a terribly, terribly imbalanced situation. It's imbalanced that Israel feels like it's completely surrounded by these Arab states, these Muslim states that hate it and want it gone. That's incredibly imbalanced as well. And that's also a religious issue. It's like that they're just as goofy, the whole, I mean, it's all goofy. This idea that your ideology, your religious ideology based on some ancient shit that nobody knows the real source of is more important or more valid than someone else's. It's all fucking madness. And look at us, look at the Christian College.

Speaker 6:          00:52:10       Here are the evangelicals did, I just saw, I don't know if you've been watching John Oliver, I really liked his show, but he had on this stuff about the Uganda gay La and you're like, oh wow, that's so fucked up. Uganda has such horrible galas. And then you realize that it's because of the evangelicals here in this country that they basically been in bolden because the political establishment for some reason it takes them seriously enough to like let them and have such a say and it's driven all of our politics of the fucking right so much. And so then these evangelicals have so much money and backing that they go across the world and start like making these laws get pushed through to fucking kill gay people. And you're like, what in the hell is going on? It's this crazy shit. Like sure. Uganda's uh, you know, might be backwards in a lot of ways, but without these American Christian evangelicals going over there and actually helping get this done, it wouldn't have happened.

Speaker 6:          00:52:59       And that's really scary because for some reason they're relevant here. And I'm not saying of course, if you're Christian, I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about the very, very, very right wing, very like money, like very small minority that have extremely powerful political voice because they have so much money and it gets people like, you know, Mitt Romney and fucking Rick Santorum. Yeah, I mean, I mean the fact that those people are even relevant. The fact that we had that as our president, like, look, I think Obama is a war criminal, but Mitt Romney's, I mean, damn, I mean these people are just nuts. Sarah Pailin, these people should not

Speaker 1:          00:53:34       anywhere near politics when fucking crazy. Mitt Romney, for folks who don't know is a part of one of the most extreme Mormon sex effort. They left the country to go to Mexico because he couldn't have a hundred wives here in America. That's mean this literally why Mitt Romney's family couldn't know his dad couldn't be president because his dad was born in fucking Mexico. His family is from Mexico. They have a giant compound in Mexico where they are engaged in like these wars with the drug cartels. They get kidnapped and Shit. Vice did this whole piece on it. It's incredibly fucked up and Mitt Romney's is. They just did. No one talked about it. My Mormonism is off the table.

Speaker 1:          00:54:14       You're like, actually that's pretty fucking important. No it's, it's on the table as fuck dude. You know you might keep it off the table and you're goofy. Legacy television shows and all these ridiculous things that you, you, you do these ridiculous debates where everything's controlled. If I was ever in a debate with that guide, the first thing I would say is you really believe Joseph Smith, a 14 year old boy found golden tablets that contain the loss work of Jesus, but only he could read them cause he had a magic barium and then no one else can see the fuck outta here. Dude. I would literally say, get the fuck out of here on TV. You're in a cult, right? Yeah. You called Sir big sometimes, sometimes culturally of 30 people. And you live in the fucking San Fernando Valley in a weird shelter and sometimes called have a billion people.

Speaker 1:          00:54:58       And you know, you've got a guy called the pope and he sits on a fucking golden throne. Guess what? That guy's a fucking cult leader. Right? You know, maybe the new ones, the best one ever because he's, you know, he's, he's sweet and he's a man of the people and he's so proletariat. Look at him. He's an awesome pope. He's a regular guy. No he's not. He's just a better cult leader then that creepy fuck that came before him that sat on a golden throne, you know, and had a gay bath house in the same property as exactly.

Speaker 6:          00:55:27       Thank you for bringing that up. Well, I'd, I know l Ron Hubbard, his great grandson, he lives in Oakland and he was telling me that his, it's very openly admitted and his great grandfather wrote it in fucking books and shit, that he was in tax trouble. And he needed to start a religion to like get out of this fucking tax trouble. He was gonna go to jail, he owed tons of money, the government. And he even said like, I'm going to start a fucking religion and get myself out of these like tax problems and wow, here you go.

Speaker 1:          00:55:50       Yeah, he did it. And to take that Scientology is any less valid than Mormonism, right? Or that Mormonism is any less valid than a religion that is based on a Jewish Zombie thought. All of it's silly, man. And it's not saying that there's no god, it's not saying that spirituality doesn't have some sort of a benefit to our society and our culture and this idea of a greater thing other than people. This greater power, whatever it may be that created the universe because there is something that runs this world, something that runs

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       this universe. You want to give it scientific terms, you want to give it philosophical term, whatever it is. There's obviously a giant energy that is created this massive fucking universe, whether it has a consciousness or not is d you could debate it all day long, but I'm guessing that a dude didn't die and then three days later come out and push a rock aside and you know, come on.

Speaker 6:          00:56:46       It's the myths that holds society together. It's all these fables and myths that are the glue and you're talking about how we haven't really changed. We fucking haven't dude. I just saw a poll that basically if a president was atheist that would be like the least favorable factor of like any candidate running for president is if they didn't believe in God. That's how important religion still is to society. And I think that even it's like we were saying last night at the comedy show that you can show someone proof that big foot that this video is fucking fake and if, and they still want to believe it, they believe it doesn't matter if you just say like, look, Jonah couldn't have survived inside of a whale for three days. It's just not scientifically possible

Speaker 4:          00:57:23       like condos in the whales. Yeah. People are, people are weird man there where would their beliefs and what's weird is as long as something's old will accept it. But if you tried to come out today with some Jewish Zombie story and people will be like, what is this asshole doing it? They put you on pills. They'd be like good on psychoactive medicine. You were sucking. Yeah. If you were standing like in the middle of all the people in Occupy Wall Street and you, you had a a chart and you were holding up this, this chart, this is how the earth was formed 6,000 years ago. In six days He created this. He'd be like, bitch, are you out of your fucking mind? If everybody just believe wholeheartedly in science, if we had completely abandoned all religion and then you came along with aversion and nobody would take it. It has to be old to be old, but when it's old we'll accept goofy shit. Ooh.

Speaker 6:          00:58:18       Though it's so much fucking shit has come out since then. Even though were the internet, we have the world's knowledge at our fingertips. We still believe in these archaic philosophies that do not apply anymore. Dude, did you hear about the Blackwater Shit that came out? How you know, you know blackwater and the like the most criminal mafia organization and somehow the mercenaries. Yeah, they're fucking mercenaries. Really. Holy Shit. And did a couple tours. Yeah, he was a marine sniper and then

Speaker 4:          00:58:43       want to make some more money after the war. We want to make a lot of money. I made a lot more money than he did for the army. They did a couple tours, opened up an MMA gym with it. That's cool. Kill some people.

Speaker 6:          00:58:56       Okay. No, that's good. I mean, I'm just trying to be nice. I think, I think anyone can go backwaters a criminal but, but Erik Prince, the guy who founded it actually did think that he was ordained by God to like fucking like kill Muslims. Like he thought that he was carrying out a holy war. So what did we do? We hired this company, sent him over to fucking Iraq. They massacre, God knows how many people, but that's not the crazy part. The crazy part that just came out. Abby, the crazy word that

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       just came out is that basically we went over to investigate them and um, the State Department official went over to Iraq right before the Nusser square massacre, which is when they just went out with fucking machine guns and just like slaughtered to 17, like fucking women and children on the street. Before that even happened, the state of artificial went over to Iraq and they're like, Yo, Yo, Yo, this companies like out of fucking control. You guys are just like, sh like crashing into cars, like running over people shooting fucking birds in the sky and shit. So they meet with the embassy and they were like, what? Like we need to, you know, this contractor that we hired is basically running our operation. What did they do? The blackwater guide. They're just said, we're, I'm gonna fucking kill you. We're going to kill you if you do anything. And He fucking left terrified. He told the embassy, he was like, they're threatening to kill me. And they're like, get out there. Like you're threatening our relationship now with blackwater.

Speaker 4:          01:00:11       Yeah. And you fucking came back beyond the law. That's what's really crazy. A lot of the things that were done by blackwater, these war crimes, they changed their name a couple of times since then and now I believe they're owned by the United Arab Emirates. I think they hired prints to start another organization because they were worried about an Arab spring event happening over there.

Speaker 3:          01:00:35       He's hot, he's provided safe harbor and Abu Dhabi and they something like Abu Dhabi in Abu Dhabi and he did start, he did triple canopy. That's what they just merged with. So before it was blackwater, then academy and then Z, and then after the story came out, all these other people came out anonymously inside blackwater x officials and they're like, no, we like Erik. Prince is like killing people. Like Erik Prince has put out hits on motherfuckers like, we know this for sure and we're fucking terrified to come out and actually put our identities because we might die to like that's how insane this student. And he's just living

Speaker 4:          01:01:08       still making contracts with the government. The CIA just gave Blackwater whatever the fuck they're called Dao. Another contract earlier this year. Very effective. Really good at their job. I mean this day, people to shut the fuck up about things. But boy, those guys know how to shut people up. Especially when you can do things that are completely outside of the jurisdiction. Right. Any laws? Ours. Theirs, I mean that word contractor. So cute. Cause I was thinking of a polymer or a guy was going to fucking get your roof. That's a contractor. Like wait, will the, those are contractors also have a fucking sniper rifles. And like what? That's a contractor. Oh, okay. Like the, you know, like when you heard that was one of the things that kept like, um, when that Fallujah thing happened and they hung those contractors, the United States contractors, like I was like, why are they killing construction worker?

Speaker 4:          01:01:59       They're killing contractors. And then you realize, oh no, no, they're killing Merce and Mary were killing hired assassins. Oh that's great. That's, that's like insurgent killed some insurgents. What does that, oh, people that are resisting, that are in the, they were born in this place that we showed up with tanks and they're resisting. So they're insurgents, you know, oh, they're not just people that live there right now. And then the other militants we can, you know, throughout history, people have had this incredible ability to dehumanize with, with, uh, terms. You know, you can just call them something and then they become the enemy or categorize them. You know what Genghis Khan used to do? Like anybody who didn't live in a tent was, wasn't a bitch. You know, Tommy's, that lived in these cities. Like they, they just treated them like cattle. Right? And that was why they were able to justify killing millions and millions of people. And that's just one of the things that people have figured out a way to do. US versus them. We love it. We love, I fucking hate windows users. You know, I'm well Mac till I die. I mean, it gets that dumb. We literally Ford versus Chevy. I saw a fucking Calvin and Hobbes thing. Yeah. Pissing on a Chevy logo. Like he's standing on a Ford logo and he's pissing on a Chevy logo. If I had a fucking drone with Hellfire missiles, I might launch it at that fucking guy.

Speaker 6:          01:03:24       Did anyone who was the fake balls on there? Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:03:28       Well those could just be misguided. No Shit. If you gave me some of those fake balls when I was 18 I might've put them on my car. I was retarded, you know, but the Calvin and Hobbes pissing on a Ford logo, Jesus fucking Christ. But there's people that like this Chevy country, if you listen quiet, you could hear a Ford rust like fucking bumper stickers like that. People love to be on God damn

Speaker 6:          01:03:53       teams your night blue or red. We're, we're really weird like that. And what better way to do, you know, to control the population to have these like fake teams of political parties that essentially there's total uniformity when it comes to foreign policy and the, you know, the militarization of like this country and surveillance and all that shit. But then you just have like these minute differences in terms of like integration or this and that. Not saying that they're like known void. Obviously there's like things that are very good about the differences, but on a big scale it's essentially you're driving the fucking country in at the ground.

Speaker 4:          01:04:29       Yeah. I think it's like what they're doing is taking advantage of these ingrained tribal sensibilities that have been with us since we were in the small groups of people that had worry about other small groups of people. Like we were just talking about this the other day that this is like one of the first times in human history where if a boat load of people show up, it's a good thing. You know? It used to be when a boat showed up, you're fucked. Men are going to get off that boat. They haven't seen pussy in a hundred years. They have guns, they have no food, they are rickets, scurvy and shit and they're just going to fucking shoot arrows at everybody and rape everybody and take all your food and light everything on fire. I mean that's what people did and now they're tourists like the, it's a, it's a very weird time that we live in. It's very in that sense

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       like that that's never happened before. So I think there's a slight erosion of this tribal attitude that you know, people used to have and it's because of access, because we can go to places that we couldn't go before much easier. And it's also because of information information and so it's when you have enough of these kinds of conversations and there's enough articles that are written on the web, there's enough conversations like real legitimate objective conversation as June. People that actually know what's going on, where they go over the, the facts on both sides and try to come to some sort of a rational can QCC unbiased conclusion. It changes the culture. I mean it's slowly but surely access changes, the culture, access to areas, changes and access to information changes, right? We're a part of that. It's all going on right now. And that's why this younger generation, these people that are growing up with no idea of life without the Internet are there, were completely repulsed by these things that are happening. But I think the people that if you polled young people today in America and Canada and places where there's no conflict, they don't have this ingrained sensibility that's due to having family members being murdered, you know, in front of them and you ask them about nationalism. I think their attitudes had been, will be radically different than people that live to a hundred years ago.

Speaker 6:          01:06:40       Totally. Yeah. I think it's the modularization of culture and it's a lot of, it's the Internet. I mean, where else can you just see a guy getting raped by a horse and Diana other than the Internet? I mean, a hundred years ago, he had never been able to see that. But I think it's true. I think nationalism, I think people are realizing how toxic it is. Um, and the more that they travel on, the more that they reach out online to people across the world and they see that we're all fucking human. We all bleed the same, we all suffer loss the same way. And there's only so much you can do to indoctrinate someone to think that someone else has a lesser human being than you. And I think that the more we learn about what's going on and the more access we have, that's going to really, really a road. But fuck, I mean the old guard is holding on, they're clinging onto that man. They're trying, they're clinging on.

Speaker 1:          01:07:23       Well, ideology is the only thing that glues everything in place to when you have something like isis or you have like this Palestinian versus Israel conflict. The ideology of religion is one of the few things that unites people in this sort of very, very rock solid position that just, it's very hard to do with when you have, uh, an agnostic population, it's very difficult to get them to just, except that these people in Canada are Douche bags and we'd go over there and fucking take that pine trees. It just doesn't make any sense. You know, people would be like, what? We're going to go to war with Canada. Right? Can you imagine if for some reason we found, you know, this supply of diamonds or whatever the fuck it is in Canada and all of a sudden, you know, we started talking about Canadian terrorism and like what? Like we're going to go over to Canada. Like, you know, people be like, get the fuck out of here. Look like, how could they be?

Speaker 7:          01:08:16       Well, this is the first time

Speaker 1:          01:08:17       ever in my life I can recall, um, the public's opposition to military action, stopping military action like Syria. Like when was the last time, listen, put your hand cup, your hand, your ear, and listen to the news for anything about fucking invading Syria. It, it doesn't exist anymore. That the, the, the conflict, the idea of the dialogue of, of going over there and military action. It's gone. It's gone. Because the overwhelming reaction to that goofy fucking President Obama speech left and right. People are like, what? Yeah, you're going to put our children at risk. You're going to send children over to fucking Syria for what? For? What's going on over there? Oh, someone use gas. Okay.

Speaker 7:          01:09:00       Why is that the red line? Yeah. What about the hundred and 50,000 people who died at the hands of Assad and all these rebels and all this shit before that. It's like, why do we have these arbitrary quote red lines where that's when we need to go and post military action? Like what the fuck is that about? What? I would love to have been in the room when they talked to Obama and then making that speech, right. And that's when, you know, and, and that's why I'm terrified of Hillary Clinton, man. Because if you read some articles about who's really like, I mean, I think Obama, once again, he's working and he's a horrible precedent. And, um, but it, Hillary's fucking crazy dude. She's like as crazy as John Mccain, they were like pushing him to get into serious so hard. Any Ron. Yeah. Hillary was like almost the one of the most militant military hawks in his whole national security team. And Man, it's going to be bad news if she gets in. I blame bill.

Speaker 7:          01:09:51       She's probably a patient of when she was younger, probably God damn hippie. She looked like she was, she got the big eyebrows fucking glasses dealing with bill and it's fun and it philandering she wants to blow shit up now. Just anger. That's how you create terrorists. Lucky she doesn't have a Dick Shit. Jesus Christ. She'd already be president probably. Right, but what do you think? Yeah, I mean it is amazing and I think, um, I don't know what the fucking think about this Ukraine Shit, man. I, I mean, were you following all that crazy shit that happened with our tea? Oh, what happened? They were trying to send you over there, right? What happened? What does that was, because I remember reading that. I'm like, Oh shit, they're trying to send Abby to Russia. Wait, I need to go to those thoughts prompting again.

Speaker 1:          01:10:39       Oh, oh, there's Hillary Clinton. Oh my God. Look at that photo of Hilary Clinton. First of all, do, don't zoom in because if you do, you miss the feet. Look at those Goddamn Birkenstocks. She might've had the original pair of Birkenstocks and these pants, she's wearing the striped pants that look like a version of yoga pants in some sort of a way. They're very tight. Who knows what kind of material they're made out of. But they're like multicolored striped and they're all, it's all pointing you towards her crotch and some geometric pattern and she's got glasses on. What happened in the glasses? She's still wear glasses kind of sometimes. Contacts. Yeah, I dunno that's her, that's her. When she was young and bill and look at, they were hippies. He had a like a hipster beard and, and she looked like a hippie. Wow. And they were uh, they were young students trying to make their way in the world. Yeah. Not Inhaling.

Speaker 4:          01:11:37       Hailing. Yeah. Fucking liar. Either wearing, inhaling cause they were putting it up their asses so crazy. I heard they eat it. If that's true. I they ate brownies. Did you just make that up? No, I heard it. Someone said that he didn't inhale. That's why I say it. It inhale cause they didn't please he inhaled. Yeah. Everybody that smokes pot inhales stop. I tried it once. I didn't like it. If he didn't like it, you're hanging around with the wrong people. Come on dude, you tell me. And all those chicks it he hooked up with none of them smoked a joint before they fuck you. Get out of here. Look at her. That's before she wanted to kill people. If he's smart enough to be the damn governor of Arkansas is smart enough to know that we'd enhance a sex guy's a freak whipping his dick out all the time cause she's hi Craig can do that. They just like fucked some girl on the desk in the Oval Office is like guess the garden shed. Just like super got to do what mother fucker. Imagine that stress being the God damn president needs a blow off some steam somehow caught the guy a little slack. Hey that was the, hey I, I don't, I don't give a fuck about people's private lives. They could have a million affairs. I mean if you're a president, that's the last thing that we should be worrying about. Yeah, I mean if anything it shows, it shows you character

Speaker 1:          01:12:52       dirt. And it also shows if you were in a really high profile position of power, it shows that you may be vulnerable to like impulsive behavior, which is kind of tricky because it's like on one hand, yeah, I think that, you know, especially if you're not in the position to start wars and shit, like, you know, I'm not worried about what someone does. The fucking head of Nabisco likes to hire hookers. Like who's this shit? Am I going to stop buying crackers? You know what I mean? It doesn't make any sense. But when you're like in a political position, when you're in a position of power, this is a one time when I go maybe Chicago look at their behavior because if they're doing like really blatantly ridiculous impulsive shit, they might be like,

Speaker 4:          01:13:39       yeah, they might be a sociopath, but even more importantly they might be out of control. Cause I, I've known some people that were completely out of control and just so powerful. They just think that they can fucking do anything. Yeah. Yeah. When you know you're the head of a company, that's not really an issue unless there's some, some sort of our friends. Yeah, it's a company that kills people. That's, that's an issue. But you know, if you're making tires or something, that's probably not an issue. But if you have the head of a country that has the largest army, the world has ever known, not by like a small

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       margin, but by fuck Rome, okay, we've got military bases in a hundred countries, hundred bases, Jesus fucking Christ like, but Clinton, Clinton is the way I described him, he's the last great American Presidential Dick's linger. They don't exist. And Dick Slinger, yes, there's, they don't exist anymore. You can't do that anymore. There will be no more. Every guy from now on that gets into that role will be a Mitt Romney time. There'll be super bland, like just without any charisma whatsoever. Cause guys with charisma, they get laid right. You know, like those JFK type guys who can captivate a nation, those guys are pussy chasers. They can't, he can't have a guy like that as a president anymore. They don't exist. Those charismatic leaders are like that charisma, that ability to do that. It's just too intoxicating to find that rare one that doesn't act on those abilities. Just this is a different time, right? We're going to have some weird ass fucking presence. I'm hoping that what it actually does is it eliminates the position cause I think the position of president is the last great Alpha monkey position. It's a dopey idea. This idea that one person as our figurehead is one person that gets to make the decisions and he can, the president could veto it. What? One Guy? 300 the one guy for 300 million. How's that fucking real? How was that still real?

Speaker 6:          01:15:36       Right. And then I love how people, they blame him and then they also excuse everything on him. They're like, oh well he, you know, a president willing to do some Motrin, but then they're like, but a president should be able to do this and that. It's like way too much fucking power. And then also the supreme court I think really pisses me off though because we're talking about a court that we have nothing to do with. And they're like, the end all be all arbitrators have a lot of different shit and it's fucking terrifying cause they're just fucking elected until death. They're appointed. They're basically like running this fucking monarchy and it's, it's crazy. It's disgusting. There's a couple of fucking fascist sitting on the supreme court and I don't want them to have the decisions. Scalia's it's sick. Fuck. He's crazy. Alito Scalia still wants sodomy to be illegal.

Speaker 1:          01:16:15       Yeah. That's how fucking warped he is. He's actually said, if people choose to have men choose to marry men, what's going to stop them from having sex with,

Speaker 6:          01:16:23       you're like, I dunno where you're, that's a sick fucking trajectory, dude. What's going to stop them from marrying pigeons? They're like, I'm sorry. How are you Supreme Court judges?

Speaker 1:          01:16:34       Can Mary Pigeons All you want? I don't give a fuck.

Speaker 6:          01:16:37       Um, I wanted to, yeah. So what were you thinking when all this fucking Rte should happen? I mean, I

Speaker 1:          01:16:41       was worried about you. I was worried about you because you were criticizing the Putin regime and, well, here's the thing. Okay. And I've had many people tweet at me, oh, she's moved piece for fucking right. Right, right, right, right. They give you an incredible amount of editorial leeway. It's very obvious if you watched the things, me as your friend and knowing you and having these long conversations with you and then seeing you talk those, that's fucking Abby Martin period. And I don't know how much oversight they have over the things that you say, but when you're talking, this is, you know, this is your opinions on these things and your opinions in in many situations, critical of Russia and critical of Putin and critical of this military regime and their actions. And you know, there was this backlash where they were saying they wanted to send you over, where were they saying they were going to send and what, what area was this? What was going on?

Speaker 6:          01:17:40       So that was, that was like Russia did this military incursion into Crimea, right when all the Ukraine coup happen. And then all of a sudden the Russian military is like making all these maneuvers on the border of Ukraine. And Crimea was basically the first little territory right there. It was fucking crazy. Cause I hear, and this is what's so hard, is like working at our t, the world hates Russia right now. Like the world fucking hate trash right now. And we're being told in the media all day putins the, you know, the biggest villain in the world. We should all fucking hate Russia. And then we're seeing like all of this shit about the gay law and pussy riot and all this stuff. So it's really tough already to just be working there, you know, already. And it's even tougher to know what the fuck. The truth is when we already know how biased the mainstream media is, especially the way that they're covering Israel, Palestine. So when they're all telling us one thing, but then all I'm getting is actual like Russian sources. I'm like, I don't fucking believe anything that I'm seeing. Are you getting

Speaker 1:          01:18:36       like an agenda?

Speaker 6:          01:18:38       Oh No, I have total editorial freedom. Here's the thing, rt Russia today, you know it in the name. It's literally the name of what the biases it was created to put the Russian perspective out in the world. Um, of course it's going to be fucking biased toward Russia. You wind up working for Russia today. That's a very strange condition for someone as opinionated as you it is. I was actually covering a occupy Oakland and Artie was the only media organization like covering the protest movement. And so I kept seeing this weird like Russian channel out there and I was like, I don't know what the, why the fuck this is Russian stations covering occupy was like, but it's great and I'm so grateful to have this platform that they're at least covering what's going on. And, and I really think it's because of our [inaudible] coverage and they were nominated for an Emmy for it.

Speaker 6:          01:19:22       That it really, like we were able to see all the videos go viral and I think it forced the mainstream media to at least pay a little bit of attention to occupy. But that's how I got involved. I saw our tea all over the place in terms of occupies shit and um, they wanted me to come and have a show. I mean they, they like their whole thing is they offer the perspectives that you don't see so they can like have the very extreme libertarian voice and then they have like the socialist voice. They have looked the anarchist voice and it just breaking through all the mainstream media bullshit. But when you're looking at the bias, of course they're going to have a fucking pro Russian bias. It's funded by the Russian government, just like you have the Al Jazeera is Qatar, the emir of Qatar funds Al Jazeera, just like BBC is run by the British fucking crown dude. All of these,

Speaker 1:          01:20:01       does that bother you working there?

Speaker 6:          01:20:03       Um, it bothers me when people tell me that I'm a propagandists and that I'm a mouthpiece for Putin because I've already displayed multiple times that I will risk my job to speak out against Putin if I feel like I want to. And I have to. And that's what ha well that, that I've done it twice already. One time I saw all this military maneuvering and Crimea and I made a statement and of course the mainstream media picked it up, touted me as this anti Russian hero just because they had no idea who I was. They didn't know how fucking controversial my show was and how I like criticize the US empire all the time. So they picked the statement up, made me an overnight sensation and then they quickly realize like I was way too controversial to be lauded. So they ended up calling me like a fucking crazy conspiracy theorist, you know, lunatic.

Speaker 6:          01:20:48       But what was really crazy about that, um, and I want to talk about our and more, but what was so fucking crazy is if anyone has watched house of cards, that's exactly how this shit actually operates in DC. Like I made the statement and in this girl was wall, which was my colleague and actually one of my best friends in DC saw all the attention that I was getting and she was just like a newsreader, very generic, never heard her voice, any opinions. Two days after this happened, I was getting all this international precedents. So she resigns live on air and is like, I can't work for Putin. I'm a mat. Like this is a horrible network and we're, and you know I'm for the truth and I'm like pro American and all the shit. And then she got picked up and loaded all this shit.

Speaker 6:          01:21:29       And then I found out that there was actually this think tank called the foreign policy initiative. This is where it gets fucking weird full of neoconservatives. It's the same people who started the Iraq war bill crystal, you know all these motherfuckers who basically force us into Iraq. They are like the most militant neo-con faction of the entire DC establishment. They've resurrected into a new think tank called the foreign policy initiative. And I found out that Liz was like essentially being used by these people. These people probably reached out to her and they just said like, look, we're gonna like help you get this media tour behind you because their whole platform, if you look at their mission statement, they want a new cold war with Russia. That's what the FPI is all about. And then you saw Liz working with these dudes, like she was just this fucking idiot pawn who was basically used by all these dudes in this neo-con think tank to spread their agenda and that and it just, it was so fucking crazy.

Speaker 6:          01:22:20       And these people in this think tank are the ones that went out on the media and called me crazy. They were like, Abby's a false flag. Putin had Abby do this to make our t look like it's a legitimate news station. Like they let journalists have editorial freedom. They're like, Liz is the real hero because she quit and she like hates Russia and like we should all pay attention to her. And I was like, this is fucking crazy. This is all like been manufactured. And that's why I was like, this is absolutely insane. And I just saw this media machine spinning and I was like the, I was like being victimized by the media machine that I critique every day. That's fast.

Speaker 4:          01:22:53       That's fascinating to watch. Propaganda disseminate, isn't it? Yeah. Fascinating. Seeds and water and grows and, and then they, they catch it and run with,

Speaker 6:          01:23:05       it was unreal. Men. Um, so you're a Putin mouthpiece. That's what we've gotten out of this. But it was hilarious cause I woke up the next morning after making that statement and I woke up to a press release saying we don't, we don't push our journalists and to saying what they need to say and like, you know, but that's why we're shipping Abby to Crimea. And I was like, pardon me, fucking going to cry me as a fucking war zone. Yeah. What did they say to you? What was the actual conversation with you? Because I remember they said someone had said we want to send her there so she can see it on the ground and see what the situation actually is. What was their contention where they were saying that there was something wrong with your perception of it? Here's the problem and I've learned a lot more about Crimea since I still stand by everything I said.

Speaker 6:          01:23:50       But Russians have a very strong allegiance with Crimea because Ukraine is like half Russian speakers. Ukraine. I know like a lot of Ukrainians that I know are literally identify with Russia, like they speak Russian and they don't speak Ukrainian and shit. So Crimea to them was actually like, they were scared and they did reach out and they wanted help. Not, I'm, I'm not justifying the military action whatsoever and I think it was really wrong to have these maneuvers right on the heels of the school they worried about with Crimea. Um, they were worried about the new interim government and how there's just like a lot of lawlessness, lawlessness. There's like all this shit going down and I guess they reached out and wanted this referendum. I don't know if it was a fair referendum. I don't fucking know. I'm not over there, but my boss and I think the boss of the whole RTI operation really didn't understand what the fuck I was doing.

Speaker 6:          01:24:40       They were like, I don't fucking get what you're talking about. They're like, we're rushing. You don't know what the hell you're talking about. You need to go over there and check it out. To me, I felt like it was a very Russian front dish, punitive like threat, like, oh, we're going to ship you there, see you learn for yourself. And I was like, what in the Holy Hell? Like obviously I'm not going to go. And I told him, I said, look, I'll go if you give me like weeks that I can prepare for war training and making my contacts in Kiev and shit. I was like, I would definitely consider going, but I'm not just going to go there tomorrow. Like what was the conversation? They pull you into the office and we want to talk to you about so much shit on TV and uh, we want to send you over to a war zone.

Speaker 6:          01:25:19       So I woke up and to this press release without even being asked. So I go into work knowing, and my boss calls me and he's like, Hey, I'd be, we need to talk to is like, I have like, uh, he was like, he was like, we want to, he's like, I have a really great offer for you. I'm like, I'm going to send me to Crimea. Shit me there. I was like, is that the offer because I'm not going. And I was like, I woke up to already saying that I was so maybe you guys gotta get your shit together and like fix these narratives before you tell the world that I'm being shipped there. So we worried about being fired. Will you ready to walk? I was ready to walk at that point and I was just trying to see what they were going to do.

Speaker 6:          01:25:51       But I think I went into my boss's office and I was like, look, this is actually the best thing that's ever happened to our tea. I was like, let me say what I want to say because people call this network of Putin mouthpiece and I was like, and you know for good reason because it does pair it the Russian line. I was like, but if you let me go out there and fucking criticize Russia, that's good. That's good. And I was like, even Fox News has diverse opinions on, they had Alan Colmes even though he was like, oh pussy, you know what I mean? But at least they had that space where they could be like, we, you know, we have liberals on sometimes it's like you need that if you want to be legitimate. And so I was like, fucking run with it. Let me do my thing. And at the end of the day, I give them inordinate credit for fucking letting me stay and letting me be there. And you know, I don't know what's going to happen. But you cannot say the same for a lot of corporate media stations that fired people for criticizing war, which is even scarier to me because those aren't even funded by the US government.

Speaker 4:          01:26:47       Yeah. But they're, yeah, they're all terrified of the wrath of the u s government. The access to stories you access to interviews, you know, whenever you see Obama sit down with bill O'Reilly, cross leg it, you know, they're sitting there like to jump to them. They're fucking their feet dangling over your other needs. Like all casual or bizarre. Strange. Really. Incestual it's weird because you know that there's certain things, they're not allowed to say questions and are not allowed to ask. Like you don't get that job unless it's your safe as fuck. You're walking into a nerf to room. You know, and O'Reilly can pretend to play hardball, but it's going to be about economics where Obama care or something like

Speaker 6:          01:27:29       we knew it was going to be about Ben Gazi, IRS and Obamacare. Like he probably, they probably already agreed to the terms. It was all pre taped, all that shit. We torture some folks torture, but I went after this whole thing happens. I was like, I went on Piers Morgan and Piers Morgan.

Speaker 4:          01:27:45       What a Dick Wad that guy.

Speaker 6:          01:27:47       That was hilarious because he had no idea. Like he just thought that I'd go on there and just talk all this shit about like throwing my network under the best, throw all my work that I'd done there under the bus and just be like, so you know you're working for this overt propaganda machine. I was like, no different than you bro. Like no different than you. It was like fucking look at what you guys have been doing. You guys have been warm on. Green us.

Speaker 4:          01:28:07       He's a fool. It's unbelievable. He's a very strange fool because I find it incredibly odd that they gave that guy that job after his whole scandal with, Oh I know the phone, tapping, standing peep of victims phones. And then did you ever see Chelsea Handler manhandle him? She handled him. That was really awkward. She destroyed him. It was hilarious. Oh she seems so irritating. I don't even want to fucking be here right now. Rich. Fuck. She doesn't give a shit. She's a comic and a drunk and uh, has it all out on the table. She gives zero fucks, you know. So Pierce Morgan, not paying attention to her and not even talking to her and in between takes and going over his notes and stuff.

Speaker 6:          01:28:51       Tex Winter Shit. Yeah, but I think self censorship is probably the biggest issue that you see on media. And this is what the point that I was trying to make is that I'm like, the only thing that I self censor about is Russia because it's funded by fucking restaurant. The money comes from everywhere. Even if you're looking at Pierre Omidyar, there's a lot of fucking dirty money that's going into that. Like a lot of neo liberal fucked up policies that he's done. It's like no matter what, if you want the platform, unless you're Joe Rogan and have the Joe Rogan experience, the money's coming from somewhere. Fucking shady man.

Speaker 1:          01:29:24       Do the Abby Martin experience.

Speaker 6:          01:29:25       I think I might, man. I mean I think I might at some point, but it's just like might have to, you know what I mean? I mean if shit gets, if shit keeps going spiraling out of control, I don't know how much longer I can like be at an organization with dirty money and still not, you know, not feel like a hypocrite and shit. But it really does come from everywhere. Whether you're looking at MSNBC, NBC, CNN, and I think that the biggest problem is that those have dozens if not hundreds of conflicts of interest. At least you know rts, Russia, you're not going to get news about Russia from our tea. That's pretty obvious. But if I'm watching MSNBC, how many dozens of corporate advertisers am I not going to get the truth about how much are they self censoring about the US are about Israel. You know what I mean? And so that's where it gets really tricky because even though it's much more of a gray area, and I'd rather know the bias and I'd rather know exactly who is funding the organization so I can maneuver around that and get the truth.

Speaker 1:          01:30:22       It's working for any company that gets their money from various sources, whether it's the Russian government, whether it's corporations that sponsor shows and want you to keep a non confrontational, non controversial stance on their network because they have this agenda because they're trying to promote as many products as possible during the commercial breaks. I mean there's a whole bunch of reasons because they want to negotiate good guests. They want to make high profile political guests feel at home. So they have to censor opinions. Okay. Tax

Speaker 6:          01:30:58       Us. Yeah. Not Access baby. Yeah. You know what we were saying before about absolutism and that's what, that's why I work for our tea. Because if I was an absolute, it's, that'd be living in the fucking jungle, drinking rainwater. I have an iPhone like criticized, you know, PR the NSA a lot. But look at fucking Facebook and apple, they're all working with the NSA. They're offering these backdoors. I use these tools because I care more about the truth and I'm giving up and I'm compromising my moral values a little bit because I'm not a fucking absolutest because I believe in the bigger picture that this is a platform that's going to get the truth out to as many people as possible. That I'm using Facebook to spread the message about this and that. And I, I value that more than I do like cutting off all social media because I believe in privacy to the absolute extreme. So I guess there's a lot of compromises that you make living in this society that we live in. And you know, it's just tough. You mentioned commercials, Dude, pharmaceutical industry. The U S is only one of two countries in the entire world that allows direct

Speaker 7:          01:32:00       to consumer advertising about pharmaceuticals and guess who's fucking preventing weed legalization than us?

Speaker 4:          01:32:04       Yeah, partnership for drug free America. What is hilarious? Unbelievable. They are funded by pharmaceutical companies, drugs fund, anti-drug commercials, kid, kid group Shit

Speaker 7:          01:32:18       like kids for a drug free America. You're like you're pedaling but yet you're giving Adderall a two year olds.

Speaker 4:          01:32:23       Well they used to take my alcohol companies. They stopped. Now it's just pharmaceuticals. It's fucking real partnership for a drug free America. Yeah. I had a joke that it was just like hookers doing commercials against strippers.

Speaker 7:          01:32:37       That's

Speaker 4:          01:32:39       drug free America. Having commercials against weed, pharmaceutical drugs kill a lot of fucking people. We'd kill zero. Like the idea behind it is so hilarious. It's just gross. It's gross and more transparent now than ever before. And that's why, you know you're not seeing that talking dog commercial anymore. It's really hard to push those things. It was just a few years ago. You know Lindsey, I wish you wouldn't smoke weed. Not the same and you smoke it and wish you were on Ahcccs

Speaker 7:          01:33:06       so you just take some fucking, take some Adderall, get shit done. Become a part of the workforce. Lindsey worker,

Speaker 4:          01:33:19       fucking Adderall, man. That shit's everywhere. I know so many people that are on that now. It's my God and really confusing. It's like you become some hyper vigilant corporate entities, some mass producing consumer. This, this person that can work 16 hours a day, hardcore and you just taxing and red lining your system all day saying, yeah, I know it dude's got a serious problem with it. You can, you can't get off. And He fucking loves it. Yum. Yum. Yum. Cha

Speaker 7:          01:33:50       10,000 kids right now. Think about how many fucking kids, two to three years old are on Adderall. Oh yeah. Is What are you first scribing to fucking babies? Babies being a baby. I'm tired of it. I can't deal with the doctor.

Speaker 4:          01:34:04       Well, I had a next door neighbor did. There's nothing wrong with their kid. They got their kid on Ritalin or something. One of those things. PROZAC riddling something, some sort of uh, uh, control the fucking kid drug. And it was really bizarre, bizarre to see this little kid become like a Zombie, you know, just like dead, dead eyes wandering around. I mean, they, these people were such shitty neighbors. They had a dog that was just so wild. They had a weird fence, like the kind of had a fence, but any dog could go over there. Like they had a fence, it was connected to a hill so the dog could just go up the hill and over the fence. And I was like, Bro, you got to put a real fucking, like their dog would growl at me and shit. And I told him that his dog growled at me and he made up some crazy story about my dog getting out and like, does dog tried to attack him?

Speaker 4:          01:34:48       He grabbed him by his neck and he was like, this fucking fat out of shape. Dumpy dude. I'm like, you grabbed that dog's neck and kept that doc from I'm talking is a big dog. I'm like, that dog didn't try to, plus my dog's not like aggressive, like you're an asshole. Right. Just making up some story because his dog is creepy. He's dog would like rally people and Shit. So, um, it was the same guy that had this kid that was just a kid. It was just a kid and they just didn't want to deal with it. They didn't want to deal. Kids need a God, they need a tension. The mom was whacked out of her mind on all sorts of fucking pills and the father was just sort of absentee, worked all day, 12 hours a day, every day, never home. And then when he was home the kid was too much noise.

Speaker 4:          01:35:26       So like put it up on pills, get him on pills. I was this crazy show. My strange addiction where people eat like fucking upholstery and thank, I was watching one where their fucking eat and taste like scotch tape. Third. Do you think third, third world countries and then that problem or is it just this vacuous like vapid like identity crisis of American just being like, what the fuck is life all about? I don't know. I mean I'm generalizing American culture maybe way too much, but I've always, where's that come from? Well, people are fucking soft, you know, it's this life is a little bit too easy. It's a little too easy to go to the supermarket and get your food a little too easy to drive in the Jack in the box and get your food. It's a little too easy to exist in this weird world that is completely and totally unnatural.

Speaker 4:          01:36:09       This cubicle world, this world of sitting in a desk all day, it's just not natural and we're fucked up. We're, we're, we're all really screwed up because of that, because of this unnatural existence that our bodies are not designed for, our minds are not designed for. So people get wacky, they started eating tape, started chewing. I'm fucking the upholstery and eat and curtains and you know, it's fucking strange. I mean, if you look at like a perfect example is act. It's all about access, right? Because in Florida they have the, it's better now, but they had a real issue for a long time before, um, before they put out that documentary, the oxycontin express, that was crazy. Oh yeah. Where they call centers or whatever that they just fuck pain management centers. What's the address there? Everywhere on the address. It's just like close your eyes and throw a dart at the map of Florida and you'll fucking hit one.

Speaker 4:          01:37:07       And they were one stop shops, which is disturbing it up. But what's more disturbing was that they didn't have a database. So you could go to a doctor Jamie over here and get a prescription and then, you know, you could go down the street and go to doctor Mike and get a prescription from him, and then you can go down the street further the doctor Michelle and get a prescription from her and there's no one stop you. There's, there's no one to know what you've done. They, there was nothing. And so because of that, there was this insane number of people that were on oxycontins. Like I'll, I'll, I'll pull up the data, I'll pull up the actual, but the number of prescriptions of people, um, of prescriptions that people had oxycontin's in Florida as opposed to the rest of the world.

Speaker 6:          01:37:56       And it's also where all the drug dealers go to buy it. And then they just go to their respective states and sell. Yeah. It's fucking nuts.

Speaker 1:          01:38:04       Yeah. It was real. It was real nuts. It was something like 90%. No Way. Yeah. 90% of the, um, of all of the prescriptions in the country, we're in Florida.

Speaker 6:          01:38:16       Oh yeah. Well, Americans, I mean we can assume more opiates than any other country in the world. Um, there's like some insane stat, like 40% of Americans are on, like at least I think it's honestly like five pills or more. And I'm, I mean, I might be exaggerating, but remember all last time Joe, we were talking about the opium and Afghanistan. Yes. Did you hear that? We are. The NSA is tapping every single phone call and storing it and recording it in Afghanistan. That convinced to me that sealed the deal, that we're like running drugs from there. I was like, so you're telling me that all every single audio phone call that's made is being tapped in start by the NSA and we're still allowing 90% of the world's heroin from coming out of there. That's even fucking crazier.

Speaker 1:          01:39:01       Well, it is. But see what people get confused about when it comes to this idea of tapping phones is that there's a person that's monitoring Abby Martin is a person that's monitoring me as a person that's got amber lions number. No, it's all just being stored. And if you get arrested then, then they're going to go through your shit with a fine tooth comb. They have all this data, but until you get arrested, they're just, you know,

Speaker 6:          01:39:28       oh yeah, yeah, totally. It's the retroactive prosecution. It's the ability to frame a case about you going back in your history and doing all the shit. Like you can pick one black man set. Exactly. Implied blackmail is what it is. It's like, it keeps you on the up and up. It keeps you from challenging authority because if you do, they know a lot of shit about you. Abby Martin. I guess my point is that if you, if we wanted to stop the opium trade, it wouldn't be that hard. Yeah. Probably wouldn't be as hard. Yeah. Um, but yeah, no, dude, when people know that they're being watched, we were talking about, you know, the generation, the Internet generation, the problem is that there's no semblance of privacy with the generation growing up next. Um, that's all gone. And people react differently. They act differently when they know that there's a camera on them when I know that they're being recorded. And what does that going to do for just independent thought? And I just hope that we can. Um, I just, I don't know what the fuck's going to happen, man. It's just, it's getting really crazy. Um, the surveillance state is just really, really out of control.

Speaker 1:          01:40:32       Well, the only thing that's fascinating to me is that it's starting to eat itself. Yeah. It's like it just came out recently that the NSA was, they were sort of using surveillance on the Senate. Yeah. So it's like, yeah, it's like you're there, they're eating themselves like, and then the

Speaker 4:          01:40:54       was being investigate those, investigating the CIA and that's how they found the head of CIA was having an affair is because they were, they were all investigating each other. It's like they're eating themselves. Like they, they've, they've gone to cannibalism. This, one of the things that many people are not aware is that a lot of government agencies don't like the other government agencies write, write, write, write, hilarious. You assholes. It's supposed to be on team America. And the fucking FBI and the CIA have issues with each other. They don't share information. They go back and figure it fucking real problems. You know, I, I think that ultimately the, the evil and the, the, the sort of creepy behavior that's involved in the surveillance state will prove to be its own undoing because they're gonna investigate each other. They're going to expose each other's issues. They're going to, you know, they're, they're attacking each other.

Speaker 4:          01:41:49       Like there's this whole thing, I mean, the, the fucking head of the CIA, the number one spook in the country gets investigated by the FBI and he loses his gig because it turns out that he's having an affair. I mean, if that doesn't show you how crazy this is and that, that guy betray us who lost his Gig was, you know, I mean, your member during the Iraq war, he was like, he was like Jesus of the battlefield. He was like the guy that everybody went to, he was the, he had an affair, can take you down and not like war Alaris with the crate. Some crazy bitch who was banging a lot of dudes. She was like into fucking high level military guys know. And they were just her thing. They were kind of like weird swingers' when it comes to, you know, hired killers.

Speaker 4:          01:42:32       Very strange. It's very strange. Yeah. That other leak about GCHQ which is like the NSA counterpart in Britain, they actually, it came out that they're manipulating poles and online traffic and essentially like, you know the whole like whoever controls the past controls the president. Well these people mother fuckers are controlling the present and the future because if you're manipulating polls, that right there can change the course of like the political evolution of the country. If you're like, oh well 90% of UK citizens agree with this, what are you going to like say no? And it's like you're just fucking making this shit up. Like you could just make it up now button again. Then that the information comes out that that's what's going on and it makes it sort of invalid. Like anybody gone, man, I can't, I think kind of in a way it does, you know, it's like look like the more the information comes out, the more the information gets in the hands of the people, the more that information becomes invalid.

Speaker 4:          01:43:23       I mean it's it or at least it becomes a weapon that's used against him. Like the betray situation, like Patraeus is like he was teaching at City College of New York and as he's walking he has to walk and you're see it any other war criminal and kids follow him and scream war criminal at them and you're like, whoa, this is crazy. These guys didn't have any protection. Like they jettisoned him. They took this guy who was like the head killer, right? He's the head military guy. The top dude who apparently like he would take credit for stuff that other people really deserve credit for. There was a lot of dissent. There's a a lot of what real issue in the military community, they had issues with this guy. I don't, you know, I don't know how much of this is true or not, but watching him walk down the street while these kids are yelling war criminal, they're holding up these signs and they're saying, we'll be back tomorrow.

Speaker 4:          01:44:14       We'll be back every day you're teaching and it's like, this is crazy. Who, who fucking expected this? And he can't do it. Let's see if we get pull, pull that video because you'll find it. It's fascinating. It's fascinating because it's like who would have ever expected, how would he have ever expected that a chick he was banging led to this? What a weird world we live in. Well, you could be the head of a military machine that's responsible for, what was the w? It's between x hundred thousand and a million innocence died in Iraq right now. Over a million 2007 pole. That was a million back then. Yeah, and I can't even imagine thinking of a pile of a million bodies. Good luck trying to wrap your head around that, but watching this guy, here it is.

Speaker 8:          01:45:00       It's fun walking blood all over you. That is really crazy. Then we just probably thought he could slink off. They don't touch him now, his face, but they never get in front of them. They don't stop him.

Speaker 3:          01:46:26       Wow. He just keeps walking just like, well, what's so weird, John, you the guy who basically codified torture is still working at Berkeley. He's just still teacher. They're like, I don't, it's fucking crazy. John, you, he's the guy who actually wrote like the torture justification in the bush, like torture memos. Like he actually wrote the Law to actually legalize torture, not legalize it, but codified it so that

Speaker 7:          01:46:50       it was essentially illegal. Yeah. And he's a fucking criminal man and he's just working at Berkeley. I love when people do that though. I mean, Kissinger, what kills me is that the, like the, the oldest motherfuckers like Kissinger and Bush senior, it's like how, and Chaney, it's like, God damn, you guys have had all the luck that you can go skydiving when you're like 99 years old and you're like a workman like Bush senior. And it's like, well, how are you? How are you? So lucky.

Speaker 4:          01:47:15       Oh God, 22 times more oxycodone. Wow. Are prescribed in Florida than anywhere else in the country.

Speaker 7:          01:47:27       And these pain centers are just still operating. Like they're still operating, but they've cut them back and this is,

Speaker 4:          01:47:32       gets really crazy. The, these poor people that were hooked on this shit, now they have to go illegal because there's no options. It's, it's become a serious issue for, for people that live in Florida because you essentially have like all these people that are hooked and they're, they're kind of collateral damage. You know, this, this, this like oxycontin express comes out, everybody finds out about this issue and the pharmaceutical companies are just raking it in, raking it in and they've made a bunch of people addicted. They've, they've create all these addicts by giving them this access is insane. Access. Like go, what's wrong with you? My back hurts. Here's a prescription growing in store and they go right next door and they give him pills and the the hardest pills to kick on the planet. I mean, within a couple of days, these fucking things are deep in your bones and you're fucked. I have a, I have a relative fucking guy, just lost everything. He, he became a junkie. I watched, I watched him have a regular job and then just become a lying piece of shit that never works and just always on pills.

Speaker 7:          01:48:39       It's fucking legal heroin. That's exactly what it is. It's, it's, it's even crazier. It's more concentrated.

Speaker 4:          01:48:48       Swallow. You don't have to shoot up. You don't have to fucking get a, uh, a rope. You don't have to get a needle. You don't have to stick a needle in your arm and find a vein. You don't have to do any of that. Just pop a pill, boom, suck on it.

Speaker 7:          01:49:03       And then you need it. Unbelievable that we are living in a country where we just still a class one drug schedule one, sorry. Is it just in the United States? Um, response, the New York Times wrote a, yeah, the, the government had a response and the government's response is fucking, hi. It's so stupid. I'm looking for it. Right.

Speaker 4:          01:49:27       Uh, Dave semen pulled it up. Uh, if you look on my Twitter from July 31st I retweeted it, but it's, uh, the response is so God damn goofy marijuana use affects the developing brain. Okay, here's the problem. All right. Their arguments are all about children. Well, they're about marijuana

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       use amongst adults. It had no bearing and the conversation doesn't make any sense. It's completely irrelevant. But their first two points are about children. Marijuana use affects the developing brain substance use in school age children has, I'll touch on mental effect on their academic achievement. Yeah. You wonder why. First of all, it's substance use, which includes alcohol, which is legal and includes oxycodones which are legal include includes a lot of shit where illegal. Yeah, a lot. A lot of things. Acute. Yeah. Students who received, and this is on the fucking federal government's website, students who received earned D's or F's were more likely to be current users off a marijuana than those who earned a raise. Yeah, okay. Whatever those they're, they're high and

Speaker 6:          01:50:35       right, right. What are you trying to say hi? Because they're not paying attention and none of that

Speaker 1:          01:50:39       school for the most part sucks a fat deck and it's probably one of the reasons why their highest fucking not paying attention. School, you're trying to stick around kid into a square hole and most kids don't like it. And most kids that are creative, anybody that thinks outside the box, anybody that has any sort of aspirations in any sort of alternative career outside of the academic process of, you know, getting a degree, getting a job, getting a cubicle, following this very rigid pattern. Yeah. The people have a problem with it. People have a problem with people telling them what to do and they get D's or F's. They, yeah, they're more likely to be the kind of kids that'll get high.

Speaker 6:          01:51:15       That's why Finland has the best fucking education system in the world because they have like very personalized education because they know everyone isn't uniform. Robots that fit into a perfect little thing, perfect package that everything's standardized and this and that. And when we're talking about like the, the vapid nature of, of people who like take all these fucking drugs to try to fill this void or eat upholstery and tape and shit and glue. I mean, you know, when you're living in a culture that tells you that working is the best, like if you work hard, you can get anything that you want. And that's not just, that's just fucking not true anymore, man. The American dream isn't available for everyone. It would never really was and it just not possible anymore. And I think people just still want to hold on to this dying fucking dream.

Speaker 6:          01:51:58       And we work harder than almost every other fucking industrialized nation. We're the only country, literally North Korea and Saudi Arabia both offer this and we don't paid maternity leave. We don't even offer paid maternity leave. So what the fuck? I mean, it just nuts. It's like, I think that we just put work above all else and we're just working ourselves to death. And it's really not what life is all about. Like even if you wanted to work and get money and really what are the chances of you getting into your dream job where it doesn't feel like you're working? Um, so ultimately you're going to be fucking miserable working your ass off just to get the money sitting in traffic, fucking coming home. You can't even have time to fuck your wife or like make dinner and you just, it just like this horrible cycle of course that they're going to be used. Shit, of course you're going to abuse drugs like there's no purpose because the purpose that you've put as your God is money and as much as we all love to buy shit, like at the end of the day, that's not going to fill the void of what the meaning of life is and why you're here. That's the real issue with

Speaker 1:          01:52:58       materialism as well. There's a lot of times people resort to materialism to sort of placate themselves because they're so miserable with their job that they're at least I'm going to get a reward. I'm going to buy that fucking Lexus. They're, they're at least going to get themselves a nice watch through at least going to get themselves a big TV. They're going to, it's asking them to be at least make me feel better for this fucking creepy existence that I've sort of locked myself into that I get to do till I'm 65 and then what? Then what? Then fucking watch my knees. Give out, watch my back, give out, watch my body decay. What are the options? I don't know. I would say to anybody that's listening to this that's confused. If there's another thing that you want to do, please at least tried to do it.

Speaker 1:          01:53:42       Find a way other people have, you know this, this idea that you should worked for a company in some thankless, loveless position and just keep doing it until the wheels fall off. Don't have kids until you have to. Okay, don't fucking get a mortgage until you have to. Don't do it and we just don't do it. When you're young, don't do it. Don't lock yourself in to needing a certain amount of money every month. Don't do it until it's mandatory until it's necessary. You could find other paths. People can find other paths being you're not going to find it. Paying attention to the fucking news. You're not going to find a paying attention to most school teachers. You're not going to find it. Paying attention to most of the standards that people hear applied to human beings.

Speaker 6:          01:54:29       That's why DC is so fucking weird because you're, that's where you live, right? Yeah. It's fucking creepy man. The belly of the beast. I'm getting out of there soon. I told my boss, I was like, there's no way I can be here for another year. I don't know. Big Sur, big Sur, go live in a cave, no cell phone reception to the Care Act Shit and just fucking move out there isn't it? I'm serious dude. After like I'm going to take a long break but, but DC is so weird because everyone there, it's just like Hollywood for ugly people. You've heard that same but it's fucking true because everyone, there's a Predator and everyone there, they look like a pudgy faced. Karl Rove, baby faced will like doughboy and they're all like these white dudes wearing plaid and all they're doing is just trying to find out how they can fuck you over to try to get like, you know, use you to do this.

Speaker 6:          01:55:13       And it just a super creepy predatory place and it's full of a lot of soul as people and they're all like, they've all navigated their, because they feel like they can streamline their careers and just fucking over humanity essentially. I mean I know that they're obviously going there more altruistic goals but it just sad that they are bred to say like, you know this, this is all that matters is money and power essentially in power just corrupts the shit out of people and they just lose sight of so much. Like once you're in that bubble you really see outside of it and it just all this like minuscule shit that you think that you're changing stuff and really like in the grand scheme of things you're just kind of perpetuating the same system and I just think it's bad. I just feel like I'm, yeah, there's not really too many radical voices out there. I have learned a lot more about like the incompetence of government now that I'm living there though I feel like I've changed my mind about some things because I've seen how fucking stupid everyone is and how like much in a bubble people are. I'm like, okay, I at least I understand why things are the way

Speaker 1:          01:56:12       you mean as far as like the ideas of conspiracy theories as opposed to just total income. Yeah, I feel the same way as more of paid attention to more things and more. I go, listen man, there are conspiracies for sure. They have always existed. They probably will until we have total transparency as far as people's thoughts and actions, which may be come a lot sooner than we think, but more likely than not, there's this terrible and competence and then there's people that are capitalizing on events. Exactly. Because people capitalize on events. A lot of times people say, you got to look who benefited from this happening. Actually no, because anytime any tragic event happens, people benefit from it. So it doesn't mean they cause said tragic event and that's where a lot of these conspiracy theorists, they make this really egregious error in judgment because it's not that the cause of the event and that's why they're benefiting because they planned it out, right?

Speaker 1:          01:57:07       It's usually that shit is just fucked from the get go. Like nine 11 is a perfect example. So many people have benefited from nine 11 and there's a lot of people that try to directly correlate those people that have benefited from nine 11 with having planned out nine 11 with very little evidence. But there's, there's an old saying, I forgot how it goes exactly, but to paraphrase it is like the uh, there's any tragedy that is not capitalized on is he is a waste and that this is like a staple of governments that they, they look at any, any situation where things go wrong. Like Oklahoma City. Perfect example. When they blew up the federal building, whoever did it, whether it's Timothy Mcveigh, whether it was a fucking Illuminati, whoever blew up that building, one of the things that happened was they started changing the laws on, on the, the ability to act against terrorism, homegrown terrorism. They used to use the term light. What does it not light skinned terrorism. There was a clean skinned, I forget what the term that they started using. Yeah. The idea of looking for a terrorist that you know as like a white man sort of looking for an arrow.

Speaker 6:          01:58:16       Oh the homegrown. Yeah. Yeah. Home grown.

Speaker 1:          01:58:18       But it was like the, the, I think the term is like literally clean skin terrorist or something like that. But they changed the law. They changed the laws directly because of the Oklahoma City bombings.

Speaker 6:          01:58:27       Um, I, well after the, after I like got propelled in the mainstream, they resurrected all the shit that I had done about nine 11 cause I used to be in the nine 11 truth movement and they were like, you're fucking crazy. Here you are on video. Six years ago saying it was an inside job, this shit. And I was like, look, I don't think it was an inside job as a journalist that would be extremely irresponsible to claim that, you know, anything. All I can do is point out things that I feel are wrong with the official story. I feel like there's a lot of things that are wrong with what we've been told. Does that mean that we know what happened? We can go out there and declare it now. Um, and really at this point all we can do is point out the people that benefited the people that exploited it.

Speaker 6:          01:59:04       Um, because it's just the fact that you're just, you know, you're just called a conspiracy. There's, it's this catch all phrase that you can just use to shut down debate. But I still have some questions about nine 11. I have a lot of questions about nine 11, but I don't, I don't go out there and say it was an inside job. But what specifically do you have questions? But I have questions about the insider trading. The fact that there were dozens and dozens of warnings beyond just the initial PDB given to Condoleezza Rice, St bin Laden Determined to strike within the u s there's like dozens and dozens more directly to the top of the intelligence. And the fact that they, I don't blame that just on incompetence. I think that someone turned a blind eye at the very least and that respect. And then we know that people bet that the stocks would fail and they fucking made a shit load of money on it.

Speaker 6:          01:59:48       Who were those people? They never investigated it. So there's just certain things like that that, that make me, me raise eyebrows, but you know, do I go out and say building seven and shit like no, because I just think at this point all we can do is point to the questions that we have and point to how they've used the event. But I think that in, in terms of all these school shootings and shit, the problem with this movement is that it started off, I was drawn to it because I'm like I, you know, I like to question the narratives that I'm given because I think that they lie about a lot of shit and rewrite history, but then it's turned into this kind of conspiracy culture where there's like a conspiracy like fucking ink. It's like making money off everything and you're capitalizing on if everyone thinks everyone wants to be this celebrity on Youtube, making these fucking paranoid videos about the Illuminati and every school shootings controlled and a false flag and I'm just like, this is just, that makes me just never want to touch that shit again because I'm just like, you guys have actually ruined just asking questions like, yes, we should all ask questions.

Speaker 6:          02:00:46       But when you're just going out there with an hours of every event saying it's a false flag, you're actually making people like never wanting to question like the, the origin of these things and that's dangerous,

Speaker 1:          02:00:57       which is disinformation as agent's job. Absolutely. Information agent is someone who connects some really credible ideas with some wacky alien on the moon fucking conspiracies that are so ridiculous that it makes the other stuff that it's connected to seem ridiculous. Exactly. Have you ever read the, the debunking of all that, um, the insider trading stuff? It's pretty interesting. Now, what is the debunking? Well, you can even go to Snopes. Snopes has it. Um, here, I'll read it. Uh, in the days just prior to the of September 11th, um, uh, uh, attacks large quantities of stock and United and American Airlines were traded by persons with knowledge of the upcoming nine 11 attacks. Right? That's what everybody parrots false. Uh, origins on 11 September, 2001 for planes are hijacked and used in the attack on America. American Airlines flight 11, leaving Boston bound for Los Angeles, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Leaving Newark bound for San Francisco.

Speaker 1:          02:01:58       Each of these planes was deliberately class a crashed killing all on board too. And to the World Trade Center towers, one to the Pentagon. The operation, uh, taken years to plan. The perpetrators knew well in advance. In the month prior to 11 September, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Um, unusual trading activity involving American United stock was noted by market analysts who at the time had no idea what to make of it. Wildly unusual discrepancies to put, uh, in the put and call ratio. 25 to a hundred times normal were reportedly observed in stock options of the two airlines in one case, Bloomberg Trade Book Economic, uh, electronic trade trading system identified option volume in ual apparent of United Airlines on 16th of August, 2001 that was 36 times higher than usual. Um, but it was during the final few trading days that the most unusual variances of activity occurred.

Speaker 1:          02:02:57       Okay. Highly publicized allegations of insider trading of advanced nine 11. Generally rest on reports of unusual pre nine 11 trading activities in companies whose stock plummeted after the attacks. Some unusual trading did in fact occur, but each such trade proved to have an innocuous explanation. For example, the volume of put options instruments that pay off only when a stock drops in price surge in the parent company of the United Airlines of September six and American Airlines of September 10th highly suspicious trading on its face yet further investigation has revealed that the trading had no connection with nine 11 and a single us based institutional investor with no conceivable ties to Al Qaeda purchased 95% of the ual puts on September six as a part of a trading strategy that also included buying 115,000 shares of American Airlines Up September 10th similar. Similarly, much of the seemingly suspicious trading in American on September 10th was traced to a specific us base options trading newsletter facts to its subscribers on Sunday, September 9th which recommended these trades, the SCC and FAA and FBI aided by other agencies and the securities industry devoted enormous resources to investigating this issue, including securing the cooperation of many foreign governments.

Speaker 1:          02:04:26       These investigators have found that the apparently suspicious because the consistently proved innocuous. So what they're saying is that the same company also bought a Shitload of shares.

Speaker 6:          02:04:40       What, what sources this, I know it's on snaps, but what's the actual citation? It's a good question. Um, because I had just read the CBS report cause someone was asking me about this and I wanted to like refresh my memory and, and I mean people to this days claim that they still don't know. And, and even the nine 11 commission said that they didn't investigate who made money off the attack because it was a little practical significance. So if that's explained, that's great. That still doesn't explain how rum, like how, you know, Rumsfeld and Ashcroft and Willie Brown were told not to fly. Like who the fuck told him not to fly in? Why weren't our lives is, how do I know that they said they were told, I heard really brown on the radio show saying I was told not to fly Rumsfeld and Silverstein who worked in the building and he had breakfast every morning.

Speaker 6:          02:05:21       He just didn't show up. I mean I just think that people did have for knowledge, I absolutely do. And also the whole funding operation. We know that there was $100,000 wire transferred to the lead hijacker from mock mood on med, which was the head of Pakistanian intelligence. And why the fuck weren't, wasn't that followed up like he was having breakfast with condo like with the White House the week of nine 11 so it's like there's just things that I just don't fucking get and I just feel like it was thrown under the rug. And the fact that Saudi Arabia basically financed this whole operation with Pakistan and we flew out all of bin Laden's family. That to me is just like, what the fuck is that? So even if you don't believe anything else, if you have no other questions, the fact that we are still tight with Saudi Arabia, funding them allies with them and they essentially like knew about the attacks and help to finance these hijackers is insane to me. That's insane.

Speaker 1:          02:06:12       Yeah. Well the war they is very weird too. When you start, they did this, they funded that work. Who is they and who came from?

Speaker 6:          02:06:20       No, no, no. We know Bob Graham. Look at fucking Senator Bob Graham's been screaming about this on the floor for the last 10 years saying they actually do know that they were financed by the Saudi Arabian government, that the Saudi Arabian government knew and they'd tell him services knew about these hijackers, where they were. And it just unbelievable.

Speaker 1:          02:06:39       And is it possible that our allegiance to Saudi Arabia financially is greater than the the desire for justice that yeah, we, we, we make so much money from Saudi Arabia oil. Yeah. And that, that's obviously probably the same reason why I've been loans family and was shipped out of the country. There's just so much money involved.

Speaker 6:          02:06:59       Well, I guess it just sickens me because if it really was the biggest deal in the world where they can implement a domestic police state and kill a million Iraqis and continue out this giant war on terror wire tapping the planet because of it, the fact that they didn't want to investigate Saudi Arabia because like the oil money or whatever, the fuck trumps the justice that says it all.

Speaker 1:          02:07:18       It does. It certainly does. It certainly says that there's creepy shit going on. And that this has been the way it's always been. I mean, this is the way they've always done business. There is a massive, massive amount of money in oil, right? The oil money is so hard for any of us to even we too, when you're especially start talking about these, all the guard families, these families that have insane amounts of money, like more like they're not publicly traded companies. They're not, they're not. Uh, they're not, they don't have to pay taxes because they own countries. It's like the ideas that we have of the richest men in the world, they're not really entirely accurate because already with Warren Buffet and Bill Gates and what about these

Speaker 6:          02:07:57       prince king gave that nobody knows about it. Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:08:00       Oil, they own massive amounts of money. I mean, the amount of money that these kings have and these princes and sheikhs, what is anybody ever will accurately got

Speaker 6:          02:08:13       reading and how much money they have. Everyone watched house of sod because it gives a really good background on Saudi Arabia. But basically it's like a hundred year old like regime because they just discovered oil and they rise to this, this status. And if you just look at Saudi Arabia is relationship with the u s like we said, it tells you everything you need to know because of the utter hypocrisy in terms of human rights standards. I mean Saudi Arabia is fucking disgusting. Zero rights for women. They used to execute gay people. I think they just imprison them for life now. So if we want to talk about Rachel's gay law, that's fine as well. We should, but for fuck's sake, let's talk about Saudi Arabia as well.

Speaker 1:          02:08:49       What is up with Russia's gay law though? What, what, why are they so like worried about gay people?

Speaker 6:          02:08:55       I think Russia, uh, you know, we're talking about a country that Soviet Union collapse what, like 30 years ago. So they're just like, I think they're going through a lot of fucking weird transitions where they're just kind of going through this evolutionary process. I'm not trying to defend them at all. I think the gala is terrible. Um, and they have a lot of horrible crackdowns on press freedom as well. Um, but I think it's just completely like apples and oranges when you're looking at Russia and you're like, how come you aren't as fucking free as us? It's like, well, the Soviet Union collapsed 30 years ago. Like they're weird place. Like, and yeah, they're run by a bunch of oligarchs and it's a lot of fucked up shit going on, but I just don't understand the totally agregious demonization of Russia when at the same time, you know, all these partnerships are so much crazier. We got to keep our mouth shut about oil from pretty simple. It is, it's very simple. Go pee again. Ting, ting, ting, ting to slippery, slimy.

Speaker 1:          02:09:50       And Abby Martin is the bladder of a small boys fist. Well, we've managed to piss off a lot of groups today. I think we should be proud. Everybody hates us now. The Saudi Arabians, the Jews, probably the Palestinians. Dennis Prager, uh, who else we can just, Hillary Clinton's probably mad at us. Everyone's going to go to portray us is pissed. Yeah, they're all good. We'll go to go down the list. We live in weird times. Weird, weird time to do, um, an internet show too, because you don't have a boss. Like you could never do this. You can never have this kind of a show and put it on television because if you did try to record it, someone would come along and they would, you know, they would chop this out or hack that out and you can't talk shit about them or this or it's not, it's not the way it goes anymore.

Speaker 1:          02:10:44       We live in a weird world. This world is changing too. It's getting weirder and weirder and I wonder what it's going to be like 50 a hundred years from now. If you go back and I was looking at this video of Chicago and it was a Chicago at the turn of the 20th century, from the 19th century to the 20th century. He's like the early, early days in Chicago. And there's these people that are like riding the horses down the street. And um, I don't remember when the first cars came about. It was like the 18 hundreds right? The late 18 hundreds they first had cars so there was like a couple cars in the streets in Chicago early 19 hundreds and this, uh, you look at this place and you like, you see this like very quaint existence. These people live to these early 20th century. We're talking about the difference between now and a hundred years from now as opposed to a hundred years ago, early 20th century Chicago, there was this video of these people riding fucking horses, horse drawn carriages and shit. It's so weird. There was a couple cars, you know, there were these weird goofy ass cars go like five miles an hour run on steam and shit. But the, the difference between then and now, it's just stunning.

Speaker 6:          02:11:56       That's why we don't need like DC, like we don't need, these representatives were not on horseback anymore. We don't have the fucking Pony Express. Like we don't need these weird representatives that represent like 30,000 people like going and voicing. It's like the electoral college is totally fucking irrelevant

Speaker 1:          02:12:12       bullshit. But do you think that it should be? Like, is it possible that when you see people like Mitt Romney or you see people that are Scientologists, that people could be too easily manipulated and that somehow or another, this has to be filtered through representatives that understand the law, but at least we know that these representatives who are going to cast the vote for their constituents, these people are educated, these people are moral. These people are, have high standards and high moral fabric. It's gross. The idea is gross because it's very elitist. But would you like if you lived in Utah, okay. And I love you too, I just got back. Would you allow the popular vote to decide a lot of things? If you knew that there was a giant percentage of people that were in a weird cult that had some strange, strange rules,

Speaker 6:          02:13:03       but look at it, the popular vote was replaced Electoral College, then New York and California, which is full of, I think a lot more intelligent people, um, would have much more of a poll and you just don't even see politicians giving a fuck about those states because it all comes back to the like, they know that it's going to go this way or that way and it's just, it's disgusting. But fly

Speaker 1:          02:13:23       over states are gigantic, right? 300 million people, three 50 whenever it is in the country. How many of them are New York, Chicago, San Francisco? How

Speaker 4:          02:13:32       we know, right? La Is it a third? Because the other two third dangerous hoes fucking creepers, there's a giant percentage that God, guns and Ram,

Speaker 6:          02:13:47       well at least, okay. So at least Europe, this two party dictatorships just crushing us, man. Because when you know, you have, you have money in politics, which is like, people spend half their time if not more fundraising, right? So how could we ever get these people to really care about changing shit if they're just trying to make money to win the next election and the elections here just discussing this dog and pony show, it's like this fucking celebrity. They spent $1 billion last time. You know, if you look at Europe, you can argue about the parliamentary system because of course there's fascist parties that get in and that's not good. But at least they have the avenues for other voices other than like two parties. And I think that it's just really dangerous to have this system.

Speaker 4:          02:14:27       There was an interesting story in the Guardian a couple of weeks ago, um, that was, uh, it was the rise of data and the death of politics. And the idea was that tech pioneers in the u s are advocating a new database approach to governance, algorithmic regulation. But if technology provides the answers to society's problems, what happens to governments? And this idea was sort of their sort of extrapolating on that, that we're, we don't need these representatives anymore. They're, they're their, this, their legacy. They're this weird system that was in place when you had to fucking attach a note to a pigeon and send that motherfucker lose to get the word out. You know, we don't need that anymore. You could directly through your phone, you could directly cast your opinion on whatever it may be. You know, and if we still have a representative system, you could, you could make the argument that that's suppressive, that's suppressive of the individual's right to choose for themselves

Speaker 6:          02:15:29       and then Gchq couldn't. But at the polls she's checking. But I, but I think decentralization is really, I think it's really key. And with technology you see things like bitcoin working outside the system. I think that we can, if we can maintain that neutrality, if the FCC wants to implement that and be fucking for the people for once instead of telecom whores, yeah. Then we can, we can really create some sort of decentralization online and try to create other avenues outside the system. Um, it's just a dangerous world because as you're saying, the more information that we have, the less relevant these like authority and establishment systems will be. But at the same time it can almost trap ourselves in a box like the algorithms online. It can cater your own biases toward you, where you, all of your Google search results are catered toward your bias and your preferential like you know, searching habits and stuff. So it's like what information, the information that you're seeking might be different than the information she's seeking and that's not good to a free and open society too.

Speaker 4:          02:16:27       Yeah, that is weird, right? It's confirmation bias that comes from surrounding yourself with likeminded people. Exactly. Get re really weird groups. You know like if you've ever gone to like a, I like to go to like very bizarre websites and message boards and listened to people just debate about things. The people that are just never would come in contact with in real life and you know, there's some right wing Republican websites out there that are so bizarre there. They're so strange. It's like Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, whoa. You guys are serious. Like there was a Sarah Pailin website launch recently, you know about that. She's got her own online TV channel, which costs

Speaker 6:          02:17:07       Liz wall is going to get a job there. Probably that's the only thing she could probably do smart enough to do. But I was reading the, the,

Speaker 4:          02:17:14       the comments and it's like there were trolls. It's like they were like comedy trolls, you know, and then I realized like you look at the guy's profile and you follow those other comments and you go, oh no, your real, oh my God, you're a real person. You know, like, you know God in capital letters is looking out for America. God blesses this fine land and people like Sarah Pailin and true in all capital Americans are, you know what? We need to get this country back on track. Like there's a few shitheads that I follow on Twitter just for comedy and, but they're fucking serious. They're legit. Like they really just want gum.

Speaker 6:          02:17:57       It's so true, man. Everyone check out. Margaret Heffernan, she has this awesome Ted talk about willful blindness and she has a whole book on like competition and the confirmation bias and how her whole thing, it sounds so simple, but the way she explains it is just like so mind blowing. And she's just like, you need to interact with people who don't think what you do. You need, this is like a part of human progress. Like you need to and it'll like reaffirming, you'll learn. You can't just surround yourself with yes men your whole life. You need to be challenged every day, like look and, and not necessarily surround yourself with a fucking trolls who are telling you, you know what Sarah Palin's fucking great. But watching the video like that dude, like the thing that we just watched about Israel, like, like do that,

Speaker 4:          02:18:37       see it someone else's point of exactly. Yeah. This is, uh, one of the guys that I follow. What Abe, whatever label we stick on ourselves, the kingdom, all caps of heaven is for who pleases the father. All caps in heaven. Wow. I love this guy. Oh, I read it some Dick was not going to publicize a little egg dickhead. No, he's got to face, he's just like some really retarded a right wing dude. I love, I love reading his stuff though. Cause I just go, what? You're a real guy,

Speaker 6:          02:19:16       right dude? It's so, and I, and I'm, you know, I'm a victim of it too because it's like, who the fuck wants to hang out with? Like people who are, you know, they're pro, you're going to be a fight. Yeah. This guy's super pro Israel. Barack Hussein,

Speaker 4:          02:19:28       pray for Israel. Use The IRS to attack America. This is what line low life socialist communist anti Israel and tie u s demagogue does. If they think Obama's a communist. Wow. They need to really, uh, Lillo's communism. It's clearly a socialist. Yeah. It's like, have you seen Obamacare? Obamacare is a disaster. The website alone is cost a billion, trillion dollars and it eats babies, runs on babies. Christian May be very uncritical thinker if they think Obama's at remotely as Socialists. Well, yeah, I don't know, but this is crazy, crazy super religious folks. I'm also back Israel because they believe that Israel is where Jesus is coming back. Right? Right. Like did you ever see the vice piece where they send these, uh, these folks, uh, who are like super duper religious cuckoo heads. They fucking make their pilgrimage. They're Christians from America and they make their pilgrimage to a, to Israel and they follow these people around and they, they're reading scripture like out loud on this fucking raft as they go, oh, it's glorious. It's glorious and all its shithead. How have you seen an idiot abroad? Uh, that's the, the rich. What's good, Ricky? Gervais' second. Hillary, I haven't seen it makes everything just looked like shit. Like a mix. All the seven wonders of the world just look terrible. Like this guy just

Speaker 6:          02:20:46       miserable. He goes and puts them in the worst situations, puts it in the worst hotels and shit. Makes his life a living hell. And he's just going around traveling and complaining about everything. It's fucking hysterical. It's awesome. Ricky Gervais' is a genius, but I want to ask you, have you seen the vice special on Fukushima?

Speaker 4:          02:21:01       Yes. Oh my good God. This is terrifying. I have a friend, my friend ensign. Anyway, he goes over there and he provides a few, he's Japanese. He uh, well he's, he was born in Hawaii but he's lived in Japan for a long time and his Japanese of, you know, his nationality, ethnicity rather, but he's gone over there. Um, a bunch of times he goes over there and it does a lot of like humanitarian aid and he said it's really strange because it goes, cause you're over there and you feel normal. He goes, you're feel fine, but then you look at your radar tech or your radioactive Geiger counter or whatever and it's just fucking off the charts. Now you can only stay there for a certain amount of time because you don't feel anything. Right.

Speaker 6:          02:21:45       Right about it. That's what's so fucked up bro. It radiation. But I just, I mean, even though I studied this shit every day, I did not realize until you see it, like until you see that that vice special and you see the tanks, how every day they're filling this whole cool like reactor up with fresh water draining the radioactive water like multiple times a day storing it and hundreds of tanks that they're gonna run out of room. All the tanks are leaking. They're spilling like 30,000 gallons of fucking radioactive water in the Pacific Ocean every day. They have no idea what the fuck they going to do. And as the water's leaking out of these tanks, they'd take the soil, dig it up, and then store it in an empty lot. Like they keep, it's like there's no solution and what are they going to fucking do now?

Speaker 6:          02:22:26       And what are they going to do? I don't know. And then the Yakuza, they're high, the Japanese government and Tepco or hiring the Yakuza mafia there to help with the fucking cleanup because they owe them debt. So all these like old Japanese men want to help. They're like, we know how to, how like we've worked on the reactors or whole life. They're like, let us go like we're old, we can die. And they're like wanting to sacrifice themselves and instead they're hiring mafia members from the Yakuza mob that have no idea what the fuck 30 I'm doing. It's a fucking nightmare, man. Real. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:22:54       What, what can they do? I mean, I know that they have that idea to dig this giant pit and then have it surrounded with frozen cones and already didn't work that already failed a failure. Now the ice walls sound like some Superman's. Yeah, like a fucking prisoner interest of solid. Well look, I mean look at Chernobyl. They have this giant sarcophagus. That's correct.

Speaker 6:          02:23:18       Jean. She was just telling me the other day that um, you know, the, the nuclear waste, even with working reactors, they just have to dig a pit and put a fucking sign on it with a skull and crossbones cause they're like, whoa. In a million years, even though the radioactive energy will still be here, they're like, at least the future civilization here will know what a skull and cross bronzes and they won't be able to dig up this waste. You're like, holy fuck. Why are we dealing with an energy that we can't harness properly? Like it's a miracle and it's magic, but clearly we don't know what the fuck

Speaker 4:          02:23:46       we're doing with it. Well, you know it. All it does is make steam. Yeah. That's what's so crazy. When you see what it really just is. I thought that it did something like may the electricity with the new clear something, a splitting atoms and it just goes right through the wires and their housing it and some giant fucking listening. They're making steam. It's hot. It's hot as fuck. Like couldn't they like uh, do that in a better way? Seems like a lot of ways to make steam. Can you use boil water? Can you guys fucking, what do you assholes doing? You guys are making some shit that you can never shut off, which is really crazy. Next to a fault line right next to the ocean. It's like what can go wrong?

Speaker 1:          02:24:29       Well, they're all over the place too, right? The really bizarre thing is when you drive down the California coast and you realize that we are on a fault, right? Like California moves all the time

Speaker 4:          02:24:39       and then you go on the way to San Diego. This is fucking nuclear power plants. That's right.

Speaker 6:          02:24:44       Design, except very small difference. It's GE as a general electric design and they are, we have 22 sister reactors here in the u s that are almost identical to the Fukushima ones. Well,

Speaker 1:          02:24:54       the thing about the reactors, it's super disturbing is people say, well, it's clean, it's efficient. It's very, it's very, you know, as far as like the access to the energy, it's very, very efficient. But once those things go bad, they're bad for forever. So you have, as of now, there's only two spots, but those two spots are toast. Chernobyl and Fukushima are fucking toast. Those areas are fucked for a hundred thousand years. And then you have the storage of the nuclear waste from all the other places that are still operational. And you have this spot in Nevada where they have a fucking hole or Godzilla goes to eat is radioactive energy. When he lands here, I mean, what the fuck man? Why this is only a hundred years less than a hundred years of of splitting atoms, right? Nuclear bomb 1945 and here we are in 2014 less than a hundred years. And you guys doing this shit and you already have two spots that are broken.

Speaker 1:          02:25:54       You know, if you could look at the future and you look at all the potential spots to go wrong, like if we, if we had a hot map where you could, you know, everything that's blue is a nuclear reactor that's currently working and functional and you have the two red spots and then you look at all the potential for red spots, these blue ones to go bad like God, we're going to fuck up a huge percentage of the world with this power source. And I don't know a better method, but if I lived in California, which I do and it never fucking gets cloudy, which doesn't, I would say maybe that's solar thing is how you guys,

Speaker 7:          02:26:31       well, let's just try it. I mean, the thing is it's not working. I think that we really do need to shut down. I'll reactors. I know I've, I've had someone on my show to talk about Thorin still there's a matter of the waste, even though it's a much smaller concentrated amount, it's still a problem. And yes, maybe we can harness it differently and more safely. But at the end of the day, like you said, is it worth the risk to fucking have this shit out there for a million years? Like is it worth it when we do have other sources? That's why Einstein, when we did split the atom and Einstein wrote this letter to the president and he was like, Whoa, where did that come from?

Speaker 1:          02:27:02       Right.

Speaker 7:          02:27:04       Um, but when, when they first saw the nuclear bomb go off on, on whatever the hell island it was that they saw the first explosion, you know, all they told them it was just to wear little sunglasses out there. There's that photo of all of them. They like quoted Bhagavad Gita and they said, we've become death. Like what have we done? Like the guy who like Oppenheimer. Yeah, yeah. It's so creepy when Oppenheimer says it, he quoted the Bhagavad Gita. He says, I am become death destroyer of worlds. It's a really creep pull it up because it's, it's, it's a really bizarre, because when you actually hear it from Oppenheimer's voice, when he talks about how he felt and you see his face, the regret, cause he was a part of this thing and that's not even nuclear energy, nuclear bomb, you know, he decided, you know, at that point in time that they'd made tremendous, tremendous mistake. And here we are, 2014 it's still our major source of electricity in the United States from America. Everyone should check out until the history of the United States because in it I learned that Reagan fucking Asshole, he was actually approached by Gorbachev to totally dismantle all of the nuclear weapons. Like he was just like, look, it's done. Let's fucking close it all down. And Reagan was like, no, cause I'm senile and I believe in Star Wars. I think that we can create

Speaker 6:          02:28:22       this giant space program and Blah, blah, blah. And he just like said no. And I blame him. Dude. He, he had the chance, he had the golden ticket and he gave up on it. Men,

Speaker 4:          02:28:30       I want to talk about conspiracies. Have you ever looked in the star wars scientists that have mysteriously been murdered? No. Oh, good Lord. That's a weird, here's star wars scientists. Yeah. If you do that, if you type that in, first thing that pumps up his deaths, conspiracy murdered. Whoa. Yeah. It's um, who killed all the British star wards scientists and there's a bunch of different websites about it. Yeah. Yeah. There's a, a real, it's a, it's really fascinating how many people died and the mysterious deaths, uh, all 25 workers on the United States Star Wars project were killed. Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah. They died in really weird ways. He died in plane crashes and all sorts of Shit. Yeah. Did it just like the sealed all 25 workers, United States star wars projects and the sting ray torpedo projects. Um, although the United Kingdom's Ministry of Defense still disputes, these workers were connected to the star wars project.

Speaker 4:          02:29:40       Most workers died either having finished important projects or when they left for other employers. Several of those who died had routinely expressed fears for their safety. The manner of their death was also very curious. And despite open verdicts or verdicts of suicide in the postmortems, there were aspects to their desks that made these verdicts seem highly unlikely. One of the strangest desk was that of Shinai Warren, a personal assistant for the company that was taken over by Ge. See Marconi, Shari was found drowned in 18 inches of water, gagged, a noose around her neck, her feet balanced suicide and her hands bound behind her back. Wow. Mark Wise and Arrow Sophomore, a software engineer for the mod was found dead with a plastic sack over his head and several feet of clingfilm wrapped around his head. This was deemed an accident by the corner, but it was exactly the same way as Mark's colleague Richard Puig who met his untimely.

Speaker 4:          02:30:45       Uh, and several weeks earlier, a Shard Sharif, uh, an experienced defense contractor was found dead after placing a ligature around his neck, tying the other end around a tree and driving off in his car with the accelerator pedal jam down. The police felt this was a most unusual suicide method, but still deemed it a suicide. Wow. Yeah. He had last been seen in Bristol, um, uh, a long way from his home looking into guest house using cash and was witnessed by a, with a large bag of money. These details, although, uh, known to the police were never mentioned in his inquest. There's a whole bunch of them. There's a whole bunch of these. Very serious, yeah. It's fucking fascinating, man. It's fascinating how many of them died because apparently star wars was total horse shit, right? It was never going to work. And, and they knew it from the jump and all the scientists that were connected to it died. So all these people that could have been able to prove that these fuckers had just embezzled all this money and had used, you know, their defense contracts and spent all this cash, all the people connected to it that actually could prove the science behind it or disprove the science behind it are all dead.

Speaker 7:          02:32:09       That's insane. That's when, you know, the CIO is up to some crazy shit. It's amazing. Well, it's like, it kind of makes sense, right? You know, it's all that profit at the end of the day, man. It really is. Yeah. The story of birth of Champagne. She was the maid of Jeb Bush or Bush or Bush Senior's family, or I forget who, and she was found crushed with an empty car that like, you know, someone had driven an empty car, backed up into the garage and crushed her to death and you're like, what did she now clearly shaken is killed. I mean, like, no one in an empty car just doesn't start and crush someone against the wall. So crazy. Yeah. Between 1982 in 1986, 23 deaths of English scientists that work in the star wars related projects.

Speaker 4:          02:32:56       Uh, professor Keith Boden killed in an auto crash. Uh, Jack Wolfson den died in a glider accident. Earnest Broccoli

Speaker 7:          02:33:05       way suicide, Steph and drink water suicide by strangulation. Lieutenant Colonel Anthony, godly missing declared dead George Frank suicide by hanging Stephan Oak suicide by hanging Johnathan Walsh suicide by jumping from a building. Jonathan Britain, suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning. These are all within like a year or two now. Sorry, Sharif that guy that we talked about placing the rope around his neck and driving off. This is crazy. It's just like the DC Madam, that woman who came out and she was like, oh, I have all this shit that I'm going to say, and she's like, I'm never going to kill myself and I can indict so many people and all of the sudden she just killed her staff whenever it was like, oh, I guess she ended up killing herself. You're like, that's just a little bit strange.

Speaker 4:          02:33:46       Yeah. DC madams those don't have a long life. That's not a bad profession. Yeah. You didn't take the most powerful murderers on the planet who essentially have all these methods and they have these organizations that kill for forum. I mean they have, whether it's black water, whatever. I mean, if there is a black water, it's police. If there's fucking cocacola there's RC Cola. Okay. There's some lower level organizations of mercenaries. This is not like there's black water. You could only go to blackwater. No, there's probably some dudes that are really good at being a mercenary. Do you know how to keep their fucking mouth shut and they don't go? Eric Prince and the whole thing and you know, do press conferences and changed their name three or four times. They might even have a fucking name, right. Call Mike. You know, Mike used to be a marine or a green baret or whatever and he, he likes making $50,000 a week better.

Speaker 4:          02:34:39       You know, so that guy works for you. Gotta be a ton of those fucking people out there. This outta be absolutely man. So DC, Madam Madam, that bitch is dead. She's fucking murdered bro. And whatever happened to her, her, all of her notes and all of her or she committed suicide. That's the official line of your question at, you're an insane conspiracy. There's, well you are and insane conspiracy theorist. You have to admit, you have to be. If you are conspiracy theorists, you're insane. If you in, if you look into any conspiracy, you're an insane conspiracy,

Speaker 6:          02:35:12       which is crazy because conspiracies exist all the time on a local level. People conspired to kill their kids, like the kid in the car, tragically, who the parents conspired to like keep them in the car. So if conspiracies happen between parents to kill their children, why is it so fucking crazy to imagine that people at a higher level or conspiring stuff? Because it's the whole, they wouldn't be able to keep it secret, blah, blah, blah. I mean, we know that conspiracies exists. Look at fucking Wall Street. What does that and Ron, yeah, exactly.

Speaker 4:          02:35:41       Look at Gulf of Tonkin, right? They'll get operation Northwoods. Exactly. And look at the fucking, the Bush administration was thinking about doing a false flag event to get us into why, oh my God, I know. Oh my God. I know what Dick Cheney said. Are they gonna do like a sly a plane and like, yeah, that was the operation Northwoods where they were going to fly a plane and blow it up in the sky and blame it on the Cubans arm. Guan to our arm. Cuban friendlies attack wanton him obey. That was 62 and Kennedy went, what? I mean, yeah, Nikki crazy. He was like, no, no, no. Yeah. That was signed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. That wasn't just like some idle chatter like they had signed off on that.

Speaker 6:          02:36:20       Talk about how stupid it is that we still like hate Cuba and have this blockade in CG on Cuba. What the fuck is Cuban doing? US Cold War grudge, like just luck. Cuba just live.

Speaker 4:          02:36:31       How's Tuba worse than Saudi Arabia? I, there you go. Yeah, and not well known. They're super close and they make great cigars and the women are really pretty see in the great great boxers and wrestlers and the right there

Speaker 6:          02:36:44       and I want to go like I did they, I'm just saying this selfishly, like I don't want to not be able to go to Cuba. I think it's just the stupidest thing in the world. Like we demonize this country because we have this, you know, communist grudge shit against them and they've, they're actually incorporating a lot of different techniques. Like, um, the Castro family is like, look, we admit that a lot of things have failed in terms of like the business side and we're like being creative. We're opening ourselves up to like some capitalist elements and I just, I just like, I appreciate the fact that they're learning from mistakes, reinventing

Speaker 7:          02:37:16       the wheel. And I think that we just have a lot to learn. Like I just think closing ourselves off from this tiny island nation is disgusting and it's absurd. And we'd still demonize them, you know? Well there are definitely fucked up though. I mean their, their whole country and their system of government and their system of forcing occupation on people is pretty fucking creepy. It's not great. We should, but I mean, this whole blockade, I just think as a disgrace, you know? Good for anybody. No, no. And I think that, who knows what it would be like if we looked at the blockade. I don't know, but it's just, once again, US and Israel are the only two countries in the world to uphold the blockade. It's like, just fucking let it go, man. Well look what's going on with China who, which was also an incredibly communist country, you know, and now they're really capitalists.

Speaker 7:          02:38:00       It's like really strange things or have like a little element, you know? I think the Cuba is a, it's a, it's a very interesting place because, well, you remember when Jay z went to Cuban, he got in trouble and in the media was like, oh look it does he know that that fucking che hated black people. You're like, what are you talking about? Like what is going on? It was the weirdest and [inaudible] 64 or something when Che Guevara and he also went over to Angola and fought like the revolution in Africa. So it's like, I don't know if that's really true, but it's just so crazy. He was the perfect guy though. It'd be on a tee shirt. He just looked like such a great revolutionary. I know people that wore a check. We'll Vara tee shirt that didn't know Jack Shit about, remember there was that wave of Che Guevara support that happened like, like a decade ago or so.

Speaker 7:          02:38:47       It can, no one knew. It was really what they were talking about. Like you could look cool. They have one, a cig, we'll Vara tee shirt on. People had Che Guevara Tattoos and he's like, why? What, what about Che Fucking Vive? A lot of it. As soon as he stops, you know, like the guy and he would have hated it. I mean like the fact that he's become this commercial figure would have been like, he wouldn't fucking hated that. You know, it's just funny that he's become this icon of like capitalism. What's a perfect example of these like surface inquiries? Like people just go to look at it like, oh that guy was bad ass. No, no, like looking into it at all. No. Trying to understand who he was or knowing like deeply about who he was. Yeah. This is like a baby. Cuba's fucked up in a lot of ways.

Speaker 7:          02:39:36       I, it's a different way to live. You know, like they don't have advertisements, they have old cars. It's kind of cool. They have these restored old cars driving around everywhere. I'll give you see modern Cuba, they have these 1950s cars. They're driving around like these old Chevy's and shit. It's really interesting. I just want to go there and just learn because they don't use pesticides and shit cause it because of how closed off they are. And a lot of ways they've just adapted in a lot of interesting ways that I just think is, it's fascinating. I think that we have, you know, I know a lot of athletes that fleed Cuba, so unfortunately I've seen the worst side of it talking to

Speaker 1:          02:40:13       people that lived in Cuba under the Castro regime, people that tried to flee got caught, you know, were forced back and then escaped again. I mean they, these fucking people got on boats and risk their lives had to be something horribly wrong with the conditions they were living in. Forced me to do that. But I would like to know if that's exacerbated by these policies of not allowing trade. Right. You know, and who knows, like if trade was opened up trade and also the influence of foreigners coming in there and influencing them.

Speaker 6:          02:40:49       Culture. Tourists. Exactly. I mean, I don't, you know, yeah. We're, we're basically like forcing the society to be closed off and who knows? Like if they weren't, you know, if we allowed the fiber lines to get the internet and that's, and that's another problem is we don't even, we've like blocked off the fiber optic like network from Cuba so it's like let them have like do they have the Internet at all? They have like very limited internet and I'd probably just, I'm getting though the US maze there, which by the way, I'm going there next week I'm going to go on Ebay and that weird, you can go to Cuba, but only the part of Cuba where it's a fucking much, I was just like a fuck you to the Cuban government just to be like, we're going to build like this torture base here. What? Like how did that happen? It happened obviously in the 60s is a long time ago. They had that

Speaker 1:          02:41:33       based there. The military base have been there for a long ass fucking time. That was the operation Northwoods. They were going to bomb Guantanamo Bay and blame it on the Cubans. Yeah, it is kind of fucked. Is that how they're allowed to torture people?

Speaker 6:          02:41:45       We tortured some folks. Is that how they're allowed to do that? Because it's over there. I mean, could you torture people on American soil? That's a good question. I think it's probably easier to absolve themselves of responsibility from doing it and keep it. That's why we have CIA black sites and like port, like um, you know, Poland and shit. So I think it's just like, as long as it's out of sight, out of mind. But what's so crazy to me about the getting of the thing is the Bo Bergdahl Sangha, how they're like, we released the five worst of the worst. It's like shit, if you release the five worst of the worst. So what about the other 120 innocent people that we already know are innocent? Like why are they still in there? If it was so easy to release the five worst of the worst,

Speaker 1:          02:42:23       why won't they release those people? Because they're worried that they're going to go and say what happened to them? Or is it because they would have to admit that they were holding people that weren't really, I mean, once they do let them go and then they start talking, then they'd have to admit that there's probably a lot of other people that are also like

Speaker 6:          02:42:40       for the bird Bowe Bergdahl thing. I think that was Bo Bergdahl. That was the dude who was like captured by the Taliban and then they did a prisoner swap five guys. Dude. Yeah. So he came back and then they gave those five dudes. Um, and I think that really blew apart the whole logic of keeping these people in and Fontana my baby, because before that Obama, you know, he'd gotten office saying, I'm going to close down get mountain. Everyone blames the Republicans for not letting him. The truth is he could sign a national security waiver and release every single one today if you wanted to. And the fact that he kept maintaining, well, you know, we can't trust to take these people back because Yemen can harbor terrorism and like they can become terrorists and then they can retaliate. And it's like, well you trust Yemen to carry out drone strikes there.

Speaker 6:          02:43:19       You're like working with the MNE government and all these other fashions. And that's where we, they release these these dudes. Um, and I just think that we need to fucking get these people out of chemo cause they're innocent. And I would rather take the chance of like having someone retaliate than to keep an innocent person in prison for the rest of their life with no charges. And my whole thing is if they're so bad, like those five, worst of the worst guys, if they were so bad, how can we couldn't find anything to charge him with for 10 years? Like, where was the charges? Where the hell, what, what happened? You know.

Speaker 1:          02:43:49       Well I've seen some instances where people were released and they talked about what happened and how they got arrested in the first place. They just went to like organizations, they went to meetings. They wa they, they listen to someone speak and then they got locked into this idea of them being a part of this organization.

Speaker 6:          02:44:07       Exactly. It's just like a gang. I mean you, I think that we have these romanticized versions of what the Taliban and al Qaeda is. It's just essentially like a gang and that if you are, you know, like, uh, like a teenager and you're like living in this area, sometimes you are affiliated with a gang because it's how you use fucking survive or it's like how you want to provide money for your family or you do running errands because you don't want to fucking get killed or beat up. So all these loosely affiliated people with like these organizations, quote unquote terrorists organizations, that was like, they were just swept up. And those are the people who are just killed now with drones and stuff. And it just really, it's this really bizarre like interpretation of what these entities really are and how they operate. Um, it's just like coming from Oakland and like the, you know, gangs out in East Oakland. It's like if you are affiliated with them,

Speaker 1:          02:44:54       do deserve to die. Right. And do you think that they can track those guys that they released the five people that they released, do you think they had some sort of a method? Like my dog is a thing they put under skin, you know, and every, if he gets like they take this thing and if he gets picked up by the pound, they run a scan on them and they go, oh that's Joe's dog. And then they can that be, they can call me, you know, there's like a microchip. I would imagine that you could have some sort of a gps tracking device that you could stick in someone's fucking scalp and they wouldn't even know it's there or wherever you know some, some part of your body.

Speaker 6:          02:45:31       Yeah, he went to Hell knows man. I just think these people need to be let out of prison. It's terrible

Speaker 1:          02:45:36       to let them out. They're going to be mad. They could cause havoc on us soil

Speaker 6:          02:45:43       so far. You know what, man, so far there hasn't been legitimate threat of terrorism. If you want to include nine 11 and the Boston bombing, other than that zero like this report just came out, we were just talking about this. This report just came out that says every single terrorist plot that's been thwarted in the last 12 years has been completely created by the FBI. And this is like mainstream news, Guardian Independent, like all these people picked up on and explain how that works cause it's really fascinating how they do this. So right now the FBI has 5,000 informants working around the clock that are getting paid probably like a hundred gs with taxpayer money just so they can facilitate, create and then the word terrorist plots to completely continue to legitimize the domestic police state and the war abroad. So these people will go to mosques and they'll pray really a morally on like retarded people or like mentally incompetent people were extremely poor people.

Speaker 6:          02:46:34       And they'll say, yo listen up 250 fucking gs and they'll work with them for like a year. Like we're talking bout like long con. It was like a long ass cons. Sometimes those, think about that you're getting paid, you know, an insane amount of money to do this on our behalf, to basically manipulate people who are weak minded and to committing acts of terrorism that would never have the capabilities before and would never have even thought of it before. But they go into these mosques and they go into all these organizations and they're like, Yo, Yo, Yo, like six months later they'll be like, okay, well, you know, we can talk about how fucked up the u s government isn't stuff, but let's do something about it, you know? And then like, they'll trust these people and then over time if you're weak enough, you'll be like, well fuck, like, let's do it.

Speaker 6:          02:47:15       You know? I mean, it's just really sad. And to me it's so sick because once they, once they Thorte the plot and then they can parade her on the media and be like, Yo, we, uh, we foiled another terrorist plot. Like, look, we're still doing a good job guys, but they don't tell you that they created the terrorists. And then of course they put in prison for the rest of their life. So it's another wasted life, wasted capacity, just put in fucking prison and just keeping up this facade, this charade that there's terrorists everywhere and that they want to blow us up and it's all fucking bullshit, man. We're more likely to get stung by a bee. You were more lucky to get crushed by a falling in furniture then we are dying of a terrorist attack in this country. We'll definitely, I mean, I mean dead from it.

Speaker 6:          02:47:56       These things, you're eight times more likely to be killed by a cop, then you are dead from a terrorist here. So it's just like, it's totally insane. And this report just blew the lid off it. It was just unbelievable knowing how much resources are going in. And then you see this whole terror watchlist thing were 1.5 million people have been added to a terror watch list and the last five years, just the last five years alone, 1.5 million. No, cause I don't think I would've been able to fly out here. So I think that, but think about, I mean, you're telling me that 1.5 million people and it's really making their lives a living hell because you need flying is like, you know what I mean? And a lot of these people's families are over and abroad and stuff. And what came out on top of that no fly list thing was that the FBI is actually using the no fly list as a tool to try to get more informants. So they will go to like Muslim dudes and be like, Yo, you're on this no fly list. You want to get off it, become an informant, turn against your community. And because the people are saying no, they're stuck on this list forever. So now they're like using it as blackmail. So there's like this huge class action lawsuit trying to do like take these people off the list and it's

Speaker 7:          02:49:07       a, it's a fucking mess, man. It's a mess. It's a giant industry

Speaker 1:          02:49:11       story about the guy in Dallas who was mentally and competent and they talked into a, trying to detonate a bomb that didn't exist. It wasn't a bomb. It was never gonna blow up. There was no bomb. Uh, they, they, they gave him a fake bomb. It's like they, they talked him into doing it, financed the whole thing, funded it coerced is poor fuck into thinking he was going to blow the bomb. And then when he tries to do it, then they swoop in.

Speaker 7:          02:49:36       Gotcha. Right handed. Morocco, there was even this one dude who worked at the mosque that actually turned in the informant to the FBI because they were like, there's some dude here like trying to like talk a little shit. They're like, oh that kind of backfired on us. We'll don't worry about it. He's an American. What? He's one of us cause you could America just let him do his thing. Let him do his job. He's there to protect America. Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:50:01       It's insane. It's very bizarre. It's very bizarre that they think that that's somehow or another law enforcement or protecting and serving like it's, this is, it's a loophole. It's the DEA uses that loophole to, there's a, there was a rolling stones or a story about a guy who was a dirty, a DEA agent who would do those sorts of things. He would get someone who is very vulnerable and slowly but surely talk them into getting him drugs and then you know, connecting them with a much larger drug dealer wasn't really a drug dealer and like organizing and manipulating him into some situation where he's going to show him how to make a fuck load of money, but there's no real drugs and so this guy conspires with them and then they fucking, you're under arrest,

Speaker 7:          02:50:48       bye mate. [inaudible] Dad. I mean you, you, you give him manipulating people. It's totally complete and trap and it's so wrong. It's so wrong. And what's different than actual suicide bomber recruiters in the Middle East that we like condensed. They're doing the same exact thing. Men, while we're doing it for freedom, we're under the constitution. We have laws in this country that we don't really pay attention to anymore. I mean, how much of the constitution is valid? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:51:18       After the NDA and you know, then Patriot Act one and two, what's left? We kind of can do anything, right? They can kind of just scoop you up and lock you up and you don't have to have a lawyer. You don't. You'd be, they can do whatever they

Speaker 7:          02:51:31       now they're charging animal rights activists with terrorism. There were these two kids charged with under the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act and you're like, I don't know if releasing geese from up farm could be construed as terrorism. Well, fog was delicious. Fuck those kids. These are comments that a geese try quite my baby. They're assholes. They're disgusting dinosaurs. All birds are dinosaurs that made it. That's what they are now. They're actually sleep

Speaker 1:          02:51:56       thinking that a good percentage of dinosaurs had feathers. They're starting to find that now. It's really fascinating. Whoa. A lot of like raptors, like if they think a lot of those fucking things had

Speaker 7:          02:52:06       feathers, you know what? I almost don't like that because now it's going to make them look silly if we like try to re reshape how they really look for like, oh, they don't look scary anymore. They just like giant Dodo birds. That's kind of funny. What kind of makes sense? Yeah, we'll, all the birds that we see today are essentially dinosaurs that survived. That's really what they are. We don't really have any ramblers and especially those, the, those types of, you know the birds with the clause, the talons, those weird feet. Yeah. Chicken. I have chickens. I have 24 you have a little tiny chickens. Yeah. Cool. Yeah. I get fresh eggs from him every day, but they're like, they're like pets. You know, there's these weird things that lay eggs that you eat. Go grab and pick them up and they'll chop their heads off and like rip their body apart and eat the meat. No, but I would, yeah. Shit got crazy. 24 of them that live off those for a couple of weeks.

Speaker 7:          02:53:00       Horrible Food and 24 if shit got ugly, I'd eat my dog. I'm gonna be honest with you. Kids are starving when you do. I try to look for food, but you want to see something gross. Pull up aerial view factory farms. I just want to show you this image that looks like a festering Zombie wound and it was like this photographer that captured this image of, and it's only in the US, which is really like the craziest of the factory farming. Um, if you go on Google image searches, you can find it. It looks like a giant green, festering wound. And it's really just like cows. I Dunno, like millions of cows and middle America and all of their waists, like accumulating it. This lagoon. It's fucking nuts. There's one of them. And if you yeah, if you enlarge that, has that, see all those dots.

Speaker 7:          02:53:46       Those are all cows to the left. What? And those lots. And that's all like the way, that's all cow shit. I don't know what it is, man. That's a satellite image. I don't know what it is, but east lagoon at Coronado feeders in Texas, find the green one too. I'm whoa. And unfortunately, um, there's a lot of activists who, you know, a lot of like animal rights activists like my friend will potter look at that. Isn't that nuts? Oh, what is this? What does it say? In a caption that it looks big. That's huge waste lagoon in Texas.

Speaker 7:          02:54:22       We were wasting no something nuclear waste site. No, no. It's just making it, yeah. Yeah. It's comparing it to how gross it looks, but there's all these, there's these laws now called ag gag laws. You can't even can't take photos of them. If you see the Tortuga Charles. Yeah, you get charged with terrorism. I'm not aware of that. If you find that, I mean look, what they do is horrifying. They chop their chickens beaks off when they're little to keep them from pecking each other because they're in such close quarters. They attack each other and it's a disaster. The factory farming is horrific. Terrible. It's one of the reasons I've tried to separate myself from that as much as humanly possible. I, like I said, raise my own chickens. Awesome. I hunt now. I count of killed for

Speaker 4:          02:55:04       animals this year. Like dismantle the whole thing too. That's cool. You have a freezer full of meat and I eat that and my goal is by the end of 2014 to only eat meat that I've hunted. I'm like, Shit, where are you hunting? I go on trips. Wow. Yeah. That killed that deer. No Way. The one that right there, the hoods. Oh yeah. Crazy. That's pretty bad ass. I mean, if everyone knew where, how food was made and where it came from, I think that we'd eat a lot differently. And I think people would view food a lot differently. It just like, we're so removed from the process of food, which is really crazy. Yeah. Well when you see it in the wild and you shoot it yourself, I mean, that's an animal. That deer, that was an animal that I got in Montana that probably had never seen a person before.

Speaker 4:          02:55:47       Right. Because it was in the badlands that was off the Missouri River. The same place where Lewis and Clark, uh, traveled. Wow. Yeah. I mean, this is a very, very remote place. There's no cell phone reception. No nothing. Yeah, it's pretty dope. It's cool animal too. And it tasted delicious. No hormones, no antibiotics, no nitrates. And we're out of time. No, Abby Martin, you're the shit. We did three hours. Wow. There's so much. We'll turn into a pumpkin.
