Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Yeah. The Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by [inaudible] dot com if you go to on@dotcomjustgotojoerogan.net. Click on the link for Alpha brain and use the code name Rogan. You will save yourself 10% off any and all supplements. But we also have some new stuff in stock and that is kettle bells and battle ropes and they're pretty fucking bad ass if you want to get yourself into caveman shape. If you want to train like, like Brock Lesnar does in the countdown shows. If you want to do some manly man working out or if your girlfriend has big boobs, it's probably cool to watch her do it. Oh, the ropes. Yeah. You don't want to watch the kettle bells. You don't want, it would've sharks don't like slams amount of chips around that bruises them. If you've never seen kettlebells before, you don't know what they look like.

Speaker 1:          00:00:44       A cannon ball with a handle on it. And then it's, in my opinion, the most effective way to, uh, produce functional strength for, uh, for martial arts, especially for Jujitsu and Muay Thai. And things like that. That's mostly what I do for my strength and conditioning. I do kettle bells and I do body weight squats and Chin ups and stuff like that and dips and um, just, uh, it's a, it's a brutal, brutal way to work out. There's one DVD that I recommend always to everybody if you can get it. It's all sold out now because I recommend it so much. Yeah. It's called the extreme kettle bell cardio workout. This guy kicks your ass with one Kettlebell. It's like one 35 pound kettle bell. It's fucking brutal. You would think I'm a manly man. 35 pound Kettlebell kind of a fucking pussy workout. Am I going to get with that?

Speaker 1:          00:01:28       Trust me. You'll get a workout, a brutal work. I would just body weight squats. Just look up Hindu squats. Do 200 of them in a row and get back to me. See what I'm talking about, bitch, we're talking crazy shit here today. I'm getting fired up, ladies and gentlemen. All right. Because, uh, James Bobo Fay is on the podcast. We're going to talk some big foot. You sons of bitches were going to get down to the nitty gritty. We're going to let people know what the fuck ticks or yeah word. So go to [inaudible] dot com that's our sponsor. Thanks also to alien ware. You're hooking us up with some fucking sweet computers and if you can't follow them on Twitter, Alienware MMA, they sponsor a lot of good fighters and uh, make it a lot easier for these guys to compete and pay their bills and pay for training and all that stuff. So we support them here at the Joe Rogan experience podcast. Sorry, James Bobo phase here and his dogs here. You talk to him again, man. Monkeys, monkeys here. Hey Monkey. All right, let's get this motherfucker started. Ryan, she's actually a squash trash fish or experience.

Speaker 2:          00:02:28       Try my day. Joe Rogan podcast all day.

Speaker 1:          00:02:36       That's a new one. I'm not sure I like it. That new fade out you do at the end. You crafty devil. That's a squatch train dog. Ladies and gentlemen, if you hear a dog or see a dog, if you're watching us on Ustream or Vimeo and you see a dog in the background that is actually a squatch trained dog. And this is an official tracking squatch hat. This is a gone squatch and hat. Did you sell these? Because if you don't, you should cause it show like fucking I thought Animal Planet trademark that they thought I did. Oh, so nobody did. Somebody else trademarking some guy in Taiwan now. Oh, those sons of bitches just fucking sell it and make them sue you because everybody would want an official Bobo con squash and hat. They sold tens of thousands on a cafe press cafe. Presto. Like anybody could go on cafe press and pretty much like make your own shirt though, right?

Speaker 1:          00:03:24       Uh, yeah. Uh, last time I looked there was like 670 websites selling those hats. Oh, that's hilarious. Dude. You've created a, uh, like you looking at your Twitter right now. I fucking, oh, sorry. I promised my buddy I texted when it started because they're driving. I can try and text him right now. We say it's on, it's on. When I was a little kid, I went camping with my parents. We were, I was probably like six and uh, we were in Yosemite and, uh, I met a dude who was a trapper, gave me like some, some stinky fucking feet of like animals, like killed like bobcats and stuff. But when you're sick it's fuck it's bad ass. Like whoa, this is cool. But uh, you know, that's when I got obsessed with big foot was talking to this guy cause he, uh, he, uh, hundred percent believed in Sasquatch is, and he, I remember it was just, he was six.

Speaker 1:          00:04:17       I was six years old when he told me this. He was just saying that the woods are so dense. There's no way everybody's been to every part of it. Nah, there's no way. He's like, if you draw, if you fly over the Pacific northwest, I guess that's the only time where you really get a true sense of how intense it is. Because we kind of think of it like, especially the Pacific northwest, we kind of think of it as like, you know, yeah, they're Seattle and there's Portland and there's some cities up there and I guess there's highways dude. A giant chunk of that is just fucking dense rain forest. No, our people are not aware of that. And that's where the, the Pr, that's the majority of sightings in America, right? Um, the most, but what people trip on is they're all their continent wide.

Speaker 1:          00:04:58       They're worldwide. How is it possible that something can be kind and, and the only video footage available in 2012 is that shitty Patterson film, Low Fat Patterson. I think he's a fraud dude. Know what happened. It was a camera. You rethink Israel. You think that was a very emotional response? Say that if you were to search or NASA, Delaware, the table. No, I'm saying it wasn't Patterson known to be a, a, a con man. I'm listening. I believe firmly that Jane Goodall believes 100% right. There's a Sasquatch, I believe very firmly. It's very possible. I think that if they found one, all of a sudden people would start, uh, you know, it would make sense to people. There's, there's all sorts of primates over this is planet. And they know that gigantic [inaudible] lived with people in Asia, right? Like, you know, thousands and thousands and thousands of years ago. And the real legit scientists that, that talk about big foot say it's possible that an animal came down with a humans do during the Bering strait.

Speaker 1:          00:06:02       But you know, realize humans are cunts. They're a pain in the ass to fucking shoot Ya. They stabbing, they make rugs. Any let's hide, let's, let's go hide in the woods. Show me a big animal that we don't kill out in the woods. It's true. But how it, oh, we would definitely kill one for sure. Why there's a killed, there's a guy who's on youtube right now. I'm subscribed to the big foot report on Youtube. You know, whenever the new video comes up, they'll send that guy. But there's a guy who claims he killed big foot. So he did you really think so? I bought. Does he have, I bought that camera cause I wa I got invited to go on the bottom of recovery mission last year and a, it's a real story, but where's the body? What happened was, I'll just give a rundown real quick.

Speaker 1:          00:06:42       I'm actually friends with the guy I thought I'd never be friends with the guy shot a squash, but he's shut the baby, right? Yeah. Shot adult and a baby. He first thought would happen. They're doing, they're driving. They were doing a huge, when they just saw a warden and they were duty turn way up in the Sierra Nevadas but 8,500 feet and it was like Halloween I think, or the day before Halloween. Sierra Nevada's are in California. Is that the huge mountains like Taco hub? I just all the way down to the Clara County. What is it? Yeah, they run from current kind of to like Oregon border base. Okay. That area though, I'm like northern California, we're a hundred miles long and 50 miles wide. That's a big, big foot siding area, right? Oh yeah. So this guy didn't believe in big foot or anything. He's total redneck, like kills it, like likes to just kill shit out in the woods. Right. And, uh, the big adult came out, was waving his hands and wiggling his fingers. They'll wave their hands and Lidl their fingers just show that they're not bears.

Speaker 3:          00:07:33       We think they're pretty smart. They're like people. So he drives a beat on his buddy, had just come back, just got a jacket, just come back from Iraq and Afghanistan combat vet and like he just was overseeing stuff shot. He's like firstly say don't shoot it. It's a, it could be a person in to see it. And Justin was looking through the scope and he's looking at it going, it's not a person. He could see it through the scope. It was uh, it was a squatch, but it wasn't one of those big buff ones. He said it looked real frumpy, kinda like saggy, like wasn't sure if it was older or what. So he's started squeezing one op and when the thing realized he was going to pull the trigger cause they were locking eyes, he turned and he shot it through the ribs, uh, like lung shot.

Speaker 3:          00:08:14       And it dropped, went down like to a sprinter position, then got up and sprinted super fast, stumbled once and then went crashing down this Manzanita, well they get out of the truck and they're walking into their trip. They never even thought of big fit. They're walking out of their trip and balls like they just saw a huge thing. They call it a monster shot it, it ran out there looking for them but they heard it crashed out in the brush. This guy's a registered bear hunting guide so he said he could tell it, you know that that was the sound it makes when it crashes. Well they get about 40 yard. It was about 70 80 yards when he shot it and they got about 40 yards there and right where the thinking was around two identical twin babies like the size, like three or four year old kids.

Speaker 3:          00:08:51       But with way bigger heads came out, came out of the brush. We're running around looking for lack of the parent and they were running back and forth cause he went, he was going to shoot one of the babies right off the bat and his buddy wouldn't let him. I kept yelling, don't do it, I'll kick your ass. You shoot that thing, go shoot it. Things are running around like 10 minutes. They couldn't find the adult and they realize okay there's two babies and they were identical twins. They'd run around, they'd sniff the ground and look around on all fours, like totally, totally countable on all fours like quadro pad, you know, just run around. When they came near each other they'd get up on two legs and they'd come up face to face and he said they sounded like too profoundly mute. People talk and they go like just real guttural sounds. But like he said like a language and they'd get back down. They were moving down and they were working their way towards where they heard the body crashed and they realized, well shit, they thought it was, they shot the mobs like well if we just shot the mom and then daddy's probably around like this thing is eight foot with a shot was probably eight foot tall, 600 pounds. Hmm hmm.

Speaker 4:          00:09:46       Sort of thing. And we'll shit, it's getting dark. We want to go here and Jack and Justin split up because they're covering different territory and the one of the little babies kept like bought without Wallace and just still this rise. We went to the spot with them. We weren't like Doctor Meldrum went and mine ski like you like the big name guys, scientists. We went out there when the snow melted the next summer. Are these the big name guys that believe in big funds or no beliefs for shit you can't see, right? Well they know it exists. It's like people believe in Jesus, but I never find like a Jesus heritage. Jesus tracker, Jesus Shit in the woods, you know, or where Jesus killed the elk or anything. But what if you found personally, so you're saying historically one of the bags, so then that would a dick, I know he feels bad now, but it could even tell that story, you know?

Speaker 4:          00:10:35       Yeah. I had a film that you shoot a baby. I know, Dude. Well he put it, he wanted to prove the story was real. He's just redneck dude. That's killer shit for fine. That kind of mindset, you know, he's not a bad dude. That's just how he was raised. And uh, he's actually a smart dude when you get to talk to him because you think he's just some dumb shit redneck when he talked to guys is pretty sharp dude. Why didn't he take a video? Why didn't they didn't have a camera? They didn't have a cell phone with them. I teach a pretty red nose and 12 yeah, this was October, 2000, whatever. 11th 10th how could you not have a cell phone? I do not. I'm not justifying what he did. I'm just saying I watched his video and my bullshit alarm went off. Oh No, dude.

Speaker 4:          00:11:14       Well, I'll tell you. I'll see what happens. So he shot it and the thing it rolled down the hill, he picked it up and look and just watched it die in his hands. Then he, then his buddy started screaming at him. He said he's stuck the body of this Bush. They took off, got out of there and they were on a hunting website and one of our buddies, Derek Randall is like, you know, talk to him on the website, whatever. Like there's like a chat room for hunters. I was like, I shot a couple of kind of jokes and how would you mount a big foot and then he's all, no, I really did. It really did. He's all dude, you, you'll get that body. I'll give you $1 million. Right. But all you have right now, it's just a guy with a story. No, no. He came back and brought, when he picked up the baby, it bled on his boot. There's blood on the boot from the baby

Speaker 3:          00:11:55       when they're, they went back out there and snow like three and a half feet and they're digging six by six foot holes down to this. Now they're out there for like a, I forget what he said, like eight hours digging, digging and then there's bloodhound they found where they, they thought it was crashed, they found it and like there's liquid mammal. I was like how all the grease comes up the ass like it at least like a greased slick there. And they found out there was, it looked like a bear fed on it cause it was just torn up and there was actually some bear prints in the snow as they dug and they'd say [inaudible] which does happen. Dan, any animal.

Speaker 3:          00:12:27       When was the last time you saw a dead deer in the woods? They don't last very long. If they're, there are a couple of days something finds it. Oh yeah. It starts getting torn up and then like road and seat, the bones porcupines eat the bones, whatever. And so, um, where was I to lead? How puppy found a chunk of meat and flash? He couldn't tell. Look, it looked like the same colors he got and it was like a, like a girl. I saw it. It's like grayish white with brown mixed in like kind of multicolored and it's weird course hair and it matches. Anyways, that is the, the the, the catalyst of the center piece of the DNA study is that piece of meat. That's the first one they got cause it snowed right on it. That was the first hold. And what does it have they done an analysis so they've mapped the whole genome.

Speaker 3:          00:13:12       What is it? It's a, what the guys that are working on it called is a relic hominid and it's not a gigantic, Pittsburgh is really so, so there are 100% convinced it's not a chimp, it's not any other kind of bad word. Word, word lead. Cause this guy that has done this study, it's a woman named Melba Ketchum and there's a lot of controversy around her and there's some weird stuff about her for sure. Like things she's done in Saje crazy. Nah, I don't know. Bed. She's a woman. I was glad you said that. How many cats does he own? How many crystals around her neck? She's cool, but she's a g Jeanette glass has a big genetic lab. She anyways, she's well known. And what's her, what's the issue that people have with her? Well, because she had to come up with new, um, God what it, I don't want to start talking to each teeth when I read it.

Speaker 3:          00:14:00       I understand that people like the scandal was it? No, no, no. She, uh, well I'll just say this from that. Now Oxford University is doing a study over in England on the same, they, I think they're getting some of the, I mean, I'm not sure exactly. I hear stuff from different people and I was just with the guys that are running the DNA project this last week, last week, I just slept in two days ago. And uh, but um, there's other labs that are, do you have to like go through peer review and they have to like, you give them a sample, they do the same test, but she had come up with these new techniques that hadn't been used before. And, and so the other labs that authenticate that then replicate the process and you had to replicate it twice each other lab. And the word is, and like there's other scientists getting onboarded cause it words leaked around in the community of those type of geneticists and stuff is that it's, it's real.

Speaker 3:          00:14:50       Like there's, it's, it's really close to human. Like where's chimps and gorillas have 98, 98.1% the same amount of d the same DNA we have. These are 99.59 9.6 the samples from age of the Yeti's or 99.4 to nine or 9.5. So what are the Yeti samples? What would they proven to be? Uh, well that was the thing was that there's these genetic markers there. They're really similar to, they're, they're like a type of PR people. Like they're there the whole, that evolutionary chain they have, you know, his, his way out of whack and aware that there was this much conclusive evidence. So I'd never even learned this before. Yeah. People do talk about it on the show that, you know, it's so aggravating. It's, it's, um, it's real frustrating because we were like, you guys never put any real science in the show. They're like, they're like, yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:15:39       And I used to get in fights with them and I actually quit the show a bunch of times. Like Susan, why like in between season one and season two, you really? Yeah, I was, I was, I was like, this isn't what I signed up for. You know, like some hokey asked, what would you say? What did you sign up? They wouldn't like a, we got some, you know, uh, audio, we've got some, we've got audio and stuff captured and, and when you run through spectographs you could rule out, you can rule stuff out, you know, and a lot of times you'll get left with the only thing that matches it would be like a, like a howler monkey or something or given, and then it goes out of range of that even, you know, the, my favorite story is Les Stroud from survivor. Oh yeah. Survivor man. That dude was in Alaska and apparently he was on a remote island and the Alaska for folks who will know it as more than a thousand islands last is a fuck load of islands, temperate rain forest in the southeast. Well,

Speaker 1:          00:16:31       he was camping there. He's doing one of his survivor of things where he stays up all night and you know, sleeps in a tent and makes his own food. I mean it's really, it shows amazing. I love the guy. Anyway, he was in Alaska by himself and he started hearing primate noises. He heard like, Ooh, Ooh, loud something that didn't sound anything like a bear. And he's like, this was like very distinct primate. And he said, then I started to make some movement and when it realized that something was there, ran hard and fast are the ones he goes, I don't, don't know what it is. But it was big and it was heavy and it ran through the woods and it sounded like it was making primate noises. I said it to him, it was a, it was a real animal. And he suspects that it's probably big foot, you know, and he's a guy that goes to these really remote places in stays for days and days. And I think he's got it in his head how there could be an animal like that that lives completely outside of human contact. And even in 2012 as he discovered just this guy story sounds like bullshit. I watched a story. I've watched him talk, watch him talk about shooting the, the, the thing that it was a baby. I was like, dude, you're an actor. This is nonsense. This is, I don't buy, I didn't buy it

Speaker 3:          00:17:44       or it takes a lot of grief, man. He's not, and he's not making any money off it. Like they're doing a book it and he's done it. And all of them

Speaker 4:          00:17:50       are crazy. People check this out. When I took them out, when we went out there, monkey loves like she's playing with big victory for up and Bluff Creek. I didn't actually see her playing with it, but it's the only daylight setting I ever had was the same day she was in the brush in that same spot, run around and I could hear something huge running back and forth. And when she gets excited, she hates, she got her ribs all brook by a bear when she was a puppy and she hates mountain lions. Wow. And uh, where he said he's stuck the baby's body. She like, she'll never hear him make a noise. She doesn't bark or anything. She meant maybe playgrounds a little bit, but she doesn't bark in a whole week. We were up there. The only time anyone heard her make any noise was when he said, yeah, I still it over that Bush.

Speaker 4:          00:18:26       And she was just walking around stiff and she went over that Bush where he said he's stuck the baby body and she went crazy and started digging holes and like, did you guys try to figure out if it was there to try and dig it out? Yeah, we had cadet like um, uh, Dr measurements set up for some cadaver dogs to the Smithsonian and stuff like that to come up. It was like a full, we had professional trackers and um, the cadaver p we had two different sets of cadaver dogs. They wouldn't do it because if it was a funny part was, is the lady, it doesn't search and rescue in the mountains with the dogs too, like body recoveries. And she was certain there that Sasquatch has lived there and she didn't, and it wasn't like, I don't want to do it. That's crazy.

Speaker 4:          00:19:01       I don't want to be involved in something that's not real. She was like, if it is Sasquatch and you try and my dog picks up on that set and tracks it, it would like a, it wouldn't ever train track humans again. They only track one thing. Those cadaver dogs. Really? Yeah, absolutely. Definitely. His handlers track a Sasquatch then they wouldn't work for humans anymore, so, but yeah, but if you've got a dog that was trained to track squats as you probably dog wouldn't live long. If it caught up to him, you think they would eat the dog. They've, they've been known to kill dogs like real pretty frequently. Yeah. Really aggressive dogs. Even dogs were just mind their own business. They've killed him. No Shit. Yeah, but dogs barking. Getting aggressive though. People say they'll see him kick him. Just know that anyone that's had their dog, Sasquatch.

Speaker 4:          00:19:45       Yeah, they see it. They see it happen. I talked to these natives. We were down squash it on the hickory Apache reservation in New Mexico and they had one called the porch and they were there. Uh, the female dog was a Pitbull, was gardener. Publish had like, they were like four weeks, six week old puppies and they're up on the site and the store is morning. The kids are watching cartoons, getting ready for school, eat breakfast, and the thing walked up on their porch and the dog was snarling and snapping and just walked up like that. It's like, and just crushed it, broke it's back, like crushed it and then stomped all the puppies and walked away. Whoa. Stomped a puppy. So big. That's a Douche bag. I think there are like people, yeah, Alex, summer, total dicks. And most of them are, are I now, what is the most conclusive evidence you'd think it's that Patterson footage because I think that footage is horse shit. I take it you're tripping. Nah, you're so wrong. You're more wrong than you know. Do you know that that guy was arrested for riding a fake check to pay for the very camera that he used to Fisk finish that film. That, okay. You're, you're talking about Greg longs

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       book, which is what I'm talking about. Which was this total, is it not true? He was, uh, he, he had some financial difficulties, difficulties for sure. Bob Gibson, the guy that was driving him and the in the Apache Indian, the tracker guy and the guy's a legend dude. He's, there is one guy who is come out and said that it was a hoax and then he was a part of it. Right? That guy's a liar. Told here's some drunk neighbor guy that used to hang out with them. That, that um, was Roger and Bob were real popular. The Roger Patterson, Bob Galen [inaudible]. They were like expert Rodeo riders. Um, Bob Gibbons, the baddest dude you'll ever meet. Dude, he was the number one ranked welterweight in the world when I got in a serious car wreck. And that his career, he's in the Rodeo Hall of fame. He's like the best tracker hunter you ever saw sobbing.

Speaker 3:          00:21:32       The guys. He's 81 he's still out there like breaking horses and roping and, and what part did he play in this? He was, he was the guy, he was the other guy that was with Roger when they filmed it. Roger Patterson wasn't a con man. No, because I've read that he was a con man. This guy put this heat as arrested for writing bad checks. Yeah, he, cause he was so impassioned with the project and like he knew that there was real and he was just thought he, well his brother in law was supposed to be finding this stuff, this guy out the athletes. It was a millionaire up there and he kinda, he was like his brother in law, like, you know, crazy Roger running around, whatever. I think, you know, and he was his partner on this and then he was supposed to be putting funds in and like it didn't happen.

Speaker 3:          00:22:18       It wasn't like, it wasn't like Rogers is total calm man. He was like, everyone, people, we've talked to them and say he's a good dude. And he w he purposely went there to try to find a big flood and he was there filming fresh tracks. They were there to film the Blue Mountain. Trackway. What does that mean? There was some sets of tracks that people had found big foot tracks. Yeah, there was to try to find a big foot. Um, at that time they were just looking for fresh tracks. I never thought they'd see it, especially in the day. Well, listen man, nobody wants to believe big foot more than me, but when I look at that video footage, it looks fake. Dude, you're tripping. Let's say a guy in a monkey suit. I'm just pull it up, Brian. Pull it up. You're way off chirping. Do you think it's a real big foot, Brian? No, it's real. I saw, I saw one of the daylight. Well, I'm not listening. I'm not saying that the files are real. I'm not saying that at all by any stretch of the imagination. Look, Jane Goodall beliefs big for Israel. She's, she said she believes 100% that there is some undiscovered primate in the Pacific northwest. I believe those were as global her exact words. What should I look up? Bob Patterson, big foot footage. Uh, Roger Patterson, Patterson. Gimlin stabilized Patterson. Big Foot footage. I'm sure it's going to put up stabilized cause he wants it. Oh that's it.

Speaker 3:          00:23:35       It's funny. Mexican border, big foot footage. His and a fucking bag of traffic. That's a, they talk to a border patrol agent though. That was tracking some coming across

Speaker 4:          00:23:46       and saw big foot down the mountains down in Arizona. Really? Okay. No stable. Yeah. Original footage. Um, okay. For one thing, let's watch she's walking. If you could say that's not stabilized. Yeah, they're going to stabilize it in a sec. Okay. Okay. Right. Let me just spit back suit. Dude. You're so off the top expert as in the world like chambers that made the the, um, okay. Right. Let's see back a little bit more. Her foot. They have a dope. If you look at that cash, they have a double ball foot and you can see it. They just found this recently right there. Yeah. You'd have to pause it. Pause it. When she's picking her foot up, it's her left foot going down. It's a total girls over there saying, oh dude, hitters, big hairy ass tits. Let's, I would love to believe that. That's a real big front. I really would, but it will be soon.

Speaker 2:          00:24:43       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:24:43       Nah, it is. It's it's way bigger than a human.

Speaker 1:          00:24:46       It's does. Do they do the things that you guys do? That's one of the things I really enjoy about your show is that when someone has a a video that they think it's big foot, then what they do is they sent Bobo out and bubbles always bigger because you're a big dude, but you're always bigger than the the what they thought was big foot except for coming up this season. One of the episodes coming up. Oh really? Got One. It's way bigger than what they got. Smart season two they wizened up. You know a lot of those people just want to be on TV, right?

Speaker 4:          00:25:14       No. A lot of them. You don't think a lot of those people with their stories. There was one guy I remember a little bit. Most will, what happens is we go there, right? Like we're, we have like a network all across the country, like big foot researchers. There's like a lot of like academics, cops like fishing game officials, like people that are seen in themselves and like they get into it. Have you seen in yourself? Yeah. When have you seen it? The last one I saw it funny. The guy just called me was with this guy, uh, Jamie j. He was your step maybe Black Hawk down? Yes. He was the real life dude. The fifth third squad leader that shot their way out, like Kimra, that rescue house and came out and met up with him and then ran out front and shot his way up.

Speaker 4:          00:25:50       Me and that guy were up there and is where I saw the, my only daylight setting. It was right on Bluff Creek or that was filmed the PG, the parish agreement films. Films. Really? Yeah. You saw one there? I saw it. That's the one I, when monkey was playing that day and the brush or I thought she was gonna get killed earlier in that day. The wonders I saw. What she was staring at. It was leaning out behind a tree and I saw lean out behind the tree for like just that fat, this was gone. I walked up there and you can just smell that smell is one of the only times we're really smelled that smell real thick. You hear about, cause I haven't smelled that. Black people always talk about that smell, but I want you to call them skunk apes. Yeah, we think it's like a, like a secretion gland. Like they can like if they get agitated or scared or mad, it'll seep out and like over Millennia, human brain is when that pheromone hits your brain, it just causes total fear reaction. Really. Yeah. That's

Speaker 1:          00:26:39       interesting. So it's like, you know what p a lot of people don't realize is that like um, the parts per million that a dog can smell of a person is very similar to what you can smell from a skunk. Right. It's really interesting because you really think about how strong a skunk smell is. The you're in your car with the windows rolled up and you're driving like, oh fucking skunk that's outside. It's outside, nowhere near you and it just a little tiny squirt. Well a dog can smell a person like that. That is a trip, man. That's a wild thing to think of. If we have a reaction to these things, some primordial reaction to these things, and that gland is just like a skunk gland, just like some, something that squirts out of to us is like really distinct. Right. Probably all, probably all animals through that smell. What was it like to you? Like what was the smell like, if you could describe it? Um, it was it possible?

Speaker 4:          00:27:33       Yeah. I'll tell you this. I walked through it to another time where it was real thick or had just walked in front of us. Like we missed it by minutes where it walked into broad date across the meadow and uh, hickory Apache reservation. I smell it there too. It was like they'd be like from here to the wall and you can walk through it and you'd just be like, uh, and like if there's no wind, right. Cause both these times there was not when, right then it just hung so thick and it was like real musty, like a Musk and it was kind of sour kind of sewage. He smelled like wet, like wet dog mix was like bear of when a bear comes out in the spring when you smell a bit of smell bears when they come out of hibernation, like that kind of smelly, stinky animals.

Speaker 4:          00:28:14       Fucking real funk but and like nut and you would not when people, cause I didn't smell it for a long time. I was around him a long time till I smelt one. Like I, I'd seen them and heard him around me before I'd ever smelled one. What's the first time you saw on the first one? I saw it was May 21st, 2001 where? Up in humble up in the bald hills. And that's where you from? I'm from down here originally. We went up there in the 80s. It's nice up there. Oh yeah, that's beautiful. So I, I was with this, uh, these, uh, this cop and this probation officer guy. And then my buddy I left, I was all excited about these guys and I had, I had just bought a gen two Ukrainian knight's scope. That's when night vision, all that stuff was super expensive. It was like a real, nowadays it just be a piece of crabby, probably buy one for 100 bucks.

Speaker 4:          00:28:59       But I'd never had one before. So I was of like little cheap, you know, big five ones. And I left on the porch when I was packing my truck to go out. We're going to go squatch and for a week. And uh, my buddy drove it up to me. We were only there 20 minutes and it's a long story dude. I know. It's okay. It's um, well, five nights before that I'd had my, my first for sure, like on an unambiguous Sasquatch and counterparts scared still to this day, it was scariest moment of my life. Like ours not didn't see him, but I saw like when they ran, when they bluff charged me, there was like, it was pitch black but you could just see black on black movement like, you know what I mean? Like you couldn't make out any, any form. But it was just a big black couple of black shapes.

Speaker 4:          00:29:45       Like it was like there was gaps in between the trees, a starlet behind, there's just like, but there were so it was just like a black blur and they ran on both sides. Me, um, I've been doing house and growls and identify all the time and never had, never had, in hindsight when we were logging up there like probably about seven years earlier, six years earlier, further down that ridge line. We've been logging there one summer and they'd come around as much. But I didn't realize what they were doing. I thought it was Indian. I thought it was pot grower Indian dudes that there, cause we were off the Rez and there'd be Knox and whistles in the morning and the Indian dudes wouldn't get out of the truck. But I like these dudes were like the baddest dudes in the resin. No it fuck with these guys.

Speaker 4:          00:30:21       And like if someone's going to, they'd be confront whoever would like these dudes were gnarly barley, Indian lager trees and would just sit in the truck and knock it out until the sun came up because we'd be up there and sharpen their saws and stuff, getting ready and just kind of stretching a little bit and just getting ready for the day and they wouldn't get out of the truck of those whistles and knocks going to sit in the truck. So I'd been around but didn't know it. And uh, but this time it was, they kid I was doing house and this thing came from the north. I don't, when you say you were doing house for folks who haven't seen the show, you imitate like what you've heard and recordings and when you, what, you know, they believe our primate Howell's tribute to big foot. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:30:58       So you can, there's a bunch of those you can find on the Internet. And I was doing those and all of a sudden I thought I heard a wolf Hollenbeck or like a wolf cross hybrid. My buddies, everyone needs to have like a while back and seven eights wolf, Husky and they don't listen to you at all. And I thought it was one of those things and uh, it was coming down the ridge and it has, it made some weird, sounds like almost like more coyote kind of sound, but that sound and then I'll just never forget it. It kinda want, it sounds sorta like mine but different. It sounded way more primal and just gnarly. And it just goes, I just remember every hair on my body shut up. My son went, Holy Shit, I'm actually having a big fit. And countering the things had been walking towards me at that point had been walking at me for probably 20 minutes.

Speaker 4:          00:31:40       I could hear it coming closer and closer and it was just so loud. I was carrying forever. I was looking down over the Klamath River and um, it just, and when it came into the tree line, I was sitting in this meadow, I was like, there's a dirt road that runs along the top of the hill. And then the left side is, um, redwood national park. And on the right side it's Timberland and there's a few ranch in holdings, all family and holdings in there. And I was sitting up there and I was, uh, this Indian woman, there's a little Indian village, knew of this dirt road about 12 miles down. Said she'd saw one. And when I was talking about my Chapati jump freight us that day on the phone, he said it was real. This is like cell phones and humble back then were like real, unless you were right in the middle of town, didn't work too good.

Speaker 4:          00:32:21       And I heard him say, yeah, May 21st, you know, about a woman's sought, we'll run across the road. Right. And I knew were shoot, cause we logged up in there. I knew that whole area. I knew exactly where he was talking about. It was a big deer. And Elk meadow, so I was like, okay shit, I know where that is. And I was like jammed up there and I had the nights because I sat there and this thing came into the tree lag. I started in these crazy roars and screaming, snapping trees and it was, this thing was huge, gnarly, just I couldn't live when it came to the tree line to my right and my two o'clock position. So that was like, it says like if this is the dirt road here, there's this metal that's kind of a crescent shape, half moon and there was a little timber stand here, brush and timber right here, and then there's a dirt road behind here. I was sitting on the other side of the road facing the meadow with my night scopes and then this beach chair look about this way. This thing came in to hear it by nine o'clock I was facing this way. This is Kevin might nine o'clock and right when it did it like this, craziest Roran snap. This tree from over here at two o'clock was this gnarly power, not just our rack. They'll take a branch or something and just bash the tree or a stomp or whatever

Speaker 5:          00:33:24       we call them power and actually do that. Or would Knoxville are lighter but just as full 90 product boom. Just to let you know they could do that in your head. Right. That's what they did. If they were ever going to kill him when they would have killed me that night because, or they're musicians, they're, they have a really primitive band. Nuts. I've asked a lot of natives about that. Like, cause they come around tribal dances and stuff and I've talked to you. Yeah. They'll keep the noise down. They'll like kind of dig on it. They dig music. Apparently the, the, from what I've heard, they don't make any kind of music. What does it, what did they sound like? Like what does the house, I'm like the how God, you gave us a version of the [inaudible] my, my version. It only did mine once from what happened. Should I do it? Yeah, of course. I get like a little bit, yeah, that's good. It's good. Like a hit and I reckon your law. Uh,

Speaker 5:          00:34:19       wow. But I do it louder. If we were outside it was um, the videos or rather the audio recordings that some people have gotten of a, of screams in the woods that they have identified as priming. Right. You know, where, where was that that they got those? Cause it's pretty all over the sounds like there's Zuri Mississippi, Florida. How come numbers and pictures of them, man, they just, they're shitty pictures and cameras don't work like the human eye. Right to, it's like your eye focused so quick and it whenever you, cause they're so used to getting shot at and they see a shoot at everything I think. But I think they know what cameras are but when they see something come up they're just gone. Like they're not sticking around. They're not going to sit there. But there is videos, there's a lot of videos but it is like we know people that have gotten them but you can't tell him it's just so shitty, low quality, low Rez.

Speaker 5:          00:35:06       Like they're almost always in the shadows. Like it'll be bright outside then they're in the shout out. People aren't using high quality gear. Cause it you, if you hadn't personally had an encounter at a certain point in time, you have to look at all these different people with their shitty photos and the things that don't, that don't really look like a big foot. You're showing you these, there's a lot of hoaxers and crazy people. A lot of people. Right. Well Moses for sure hooks. There's almost not a knowing that you're dealing with, you're in a business where half the people were full of Shit, let's say being, being nice guy.

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       I think that's being nice. That research. Bigfoot? No, no. Not Research. Big Foot that have claimed to have seen him I think. I think, I don't think half of them are full of shit. No Way. Cause there's, I've talked to over 4,000 people that have seen him and maybe a hundred or 200 we're trying to bullshit me. Only 102 hundred really because this is before I was on TV and stuff mostly. You know what I mean? Like I just be talking about, you know, people in the community. Like I've talked a couple of my professors when I was going to school, I had seen him, um, we did all kinds of people. We did this thing once. You can't trust it once you put it on TV, like your show right now. Like I see people that raise their hands and I'm like, this motherfucker, this shit up as town hall meetings.

Speaker 1:          00:36:20       When did you see a big player? I'll fucking, they just like you could tell some, some folks will just make shit up to get on camera. And a, I did a show for CBS wants, it was called game show in my head and one of the things we did was we would show up somewhere pretending to be a real news crew. And um, the assignment that the contestant had was you have to get someone to agree to have seen something that they didn't actually see because uh, your witness took off and it's a Ufo sighting. So you have to get someone tell them you're going to put them on the news and say, listen, I, you know, I was a, we were about to film this guy. Do you think you could pretend that you had seen the Ufo? Every fucking one of them said yes.

Speaker 1:          00:37:01       It was crazy. You could tell though, you couldn't tell man. What do you watch the playback? You couldn't tell they were bullshit. It was no different than listening to people. And you show talk about big foot. There is a difference though because you know what's funny is a lot of um, we, we deal with a lot of law enforcement will cause they'd go out to rural residents is like breaking, it's like stealing chickens or freezers like big foot steel. Chickens are omnivores and uh, a lot of cops watch are the Guy John Friend is a cop was out before he, he's certified federally to be a deception expert when he trains other law enforcement agencies. And uh, we've heard like other, uh, police training and she's like, well they teach them like, uh, uh, deception. Like what to look for when people are lying and they watch, they watch our show for the witnesses and they said they're surprised at how they aren't lying. Almost all the ones they see how more? Three cause I bet that guy sucks at that. I don't know other ones or other, other, other, other like other people that did instruct on them better. That shit. The Nim

Speaker 3:          00:38:01       I could just see Roscoe Pico. Yeah. How much rain, you know, expert in the laws in the hearts of deception. Oh, Ross. On the Sni by me. The Duke was, um, like if that kind of, if that kind of officer said I was a trained professional. How many times have you been out on a show? Right? No

Speaker 1:          00:38:19       though where you're going with the witnesses and you go, man, I think this guy might be full of shit. Not We just did. Um, well I can't, I can't tell you what, which ones haven't. I don't think none of the, none of the ones that we aired. And Dude, if someone was pulling a prank, believe me, they'd be growing up not pulling

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       the prank. Just they're crazy and they want a friend instead. They have a big foot story. Yeah. Oh we get, there's some of that for sure. But you know, we, we don't put those people on a show. Like they might, they might show clips from the town hall, but we don't go out to their spot with them. And a lot of those guys would go out with like, they've already been vetted like several times. Local BFR investigators have gone there with the person and gone over the old siding. Although we did have, we just did one on the show where we're pretty sure that we don't know for sure what we do. The guys were pretty sure that he was a line, you know. Well if you guys are sure that guy was lying, I bet he's fucking lie. Like moneymaker those. I, you've seen the show, right?

Speaker 3:          00:39:13       Moneymakers just real stairs out. I'd be like, you know, just thinks it's funny. That is his name. First of all, it's real name is Matt moneymaker. That's hilarious. Dad's a famous bankruptcy attorney here in Beverly Hills. They enrich moneymaker. That's even funnier. Rich money made the bankruptcy attorney, I mean, if you were going to have a Coen brothers movie and it was going to be a plotline, didn't involved a big foot TV show, you guys would be perfectly cast. You know, you blow the Sasquatch expert is always bigger than the video. Matt moneymaker, the guy's name is moneymakers that alone. It sounds like a character. It's awesome. Yeah. You guys all get together. Like how did this show gets started? Um, I hooked up with Matt, uh, through, well he runs the BFR bro. I don't know if you've ever looked at website, bigfoot field researchers organization.

Speaker 3:          00:40:03       It's got like 50,000 sightings on it, whatever. And it was real hard to get him back then. Like, you know, and I was just like whatever. Fishermen lager guy didn't have any credentials or anything like that. But I always went out and I knew a lot of the natives out there and I worked in the woods out there and I spent time out there and I talk to people and I just need to lay of the land. So I hooked up with this guy, John Frayed is, and then I was like a volunteer, whatever it would be a far off for a few years. And then in 2003, they were filming that show mysteries and counters on outdoor left network. It was Matt, not, I'm not in if ever. So I was just one season. But uh, Matt and autumn,

Speaker 4:          00:40:38       we're on it. And then I was on like three episodes of that. We were cruising around in northern cal and, um, uh, then he made me like, oh, whatever investment you have to get, you know, you had to go through steps being an investigator. Like you gotta know what you were talking about. And maybe now there's, there's definitely people that are in the BFR now. There's like several hundred people across countries. It's good cause it's a broader net, but some of the people just don't have the woods experience. Like when they go out there, they don't, uh, like people misidentify stuff all the time. Like, you know, a lot of the stuff, a lot of stuff I gotta do appeal to some of that. I'm a big foot action out there. You get out there and it's a bobcat and he or there's a barred owl moved in and you know, at some bar dot. Yeah. Could be just stuff like our bear, whatever. But I'll say this for all the Times that people say they saw big foot and it was a bear. I'll bet you there's way more times where people saw big foot and go, I just saw a weird bear, right? Because they brang came in process big foot, especially before sixties.

Speaker 5:          00:41:34       There's my buddy Scott McLean lives right down here in Santa Monica. He's compiled that he's putting a book out and it's all like pre 1950 newspaper accounts. He's got like 1500 of them from North America back to the 17 hundreds of people reporting orangutans because it was before gorillas were discovered that wants to, gorillas were discovered, people the description switched from orangutan to gorilla. Would they compare it to, or a wild man? There's wild man stories like, um, up in humble, they call them, the loggers call them. Uh, since, uh, since the 18 hundreds. Wood, apes and brush apes. There's, there's a 137 names up and down the west coast with monkey or ape. And then they like Monkey Creek, Ape Canyon, Monkey Ridge, eight ridge. Like they're all over the place. And they'd get that name because that's where the brush shapes lived. Jesus. How fucking cool would it be if they actually got some real fudge, some real honest to good at goodness.

Speaker 5:          00:42:30       You can't fuck with it. And at least my phone one footage and, or quote captured one or captured a Sasquatch tracked one and dragged it out there. There's footage. They won't release it. We just went there. We did an episode there. Uh, I won't release. No, it's a tribe. They got on a security camera behind the casino. What and why won't they release it? Dude, it's, it's super heavy. Uh, the squatch to the natives is, um, listen, anything for money, liquid they did with these, they'll take the money. They set up casinos down there. They seem to offer him some cash. Xavier. Now do. There's certain, there's some tribes, there's a few tribes like that, but most of them that there's still old people in charge that like they listen to them about that kind of stuff, like cultural stuff. So the Sasquatch video, if they, that's their culture that you would never be able to release a video of it.

Speaker 5:          00:43:24       It's funny because I've talked to some, some tribes where they said that that it's, it's signifies the end of the world is Sasquatch has brought in like captured. Yeah. It'd be like, that's like their life has gotten so crazy that someone caught a big foot or you know, brought in a body, whatever. Well now this guy who I think is full of shit, he was telling the story about shooting the baby. Why wouldn't you just bring a piece of it with them? Why would you cut off a finger if he's willing to cut killing on these fucking things? Like it's a, like it's a dog or like it's a coyote or something. He just take the blood to another blood DNA per person.

Speaker 5:          00:43:59       How Crawford's in at that point his buddy came over, was super pissed at him for shooting it and then they were starting to trick was, is at this point getting really dark and they're just going like, okay, there's gotta be another bit. It takes two to make babies. There's gotta be another big one. They let he, they, they definitely regret not bringing it because they could have brought the baby line weighed like 30, 35 pounds. Like that doesn't make any sense to me. I don't believe him. It sounds like horse shit. It sounds like horse shit. The guy doesn't have a photo of it. He shoots a big foot and he's not going to bring something to it. There's no way you would bring nothing back. But they map the genome of that sense of that flush sample he brought in. Yeah. But that's some shit

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       they found there after the fact. He didn't take it facility and bring it with them. Right? Yeah. There's no direct chain of custody. But um, did, you can't argue DNA. Well, if you really do say that the DNA has been mapped and it is something new hominid but isn't the woman crazy? That's DNA. I'll say. I didn't say that. Well I mean that there's at least that at least there's some controversy about it or some controversy. If there's any controversy, just take it to like a, like a regular DNA map and starting like a known company. There, there is, there's other and the other labs are coming up to the same conclusions as her. What's her name? Melba. Melba. Mel Lba Ketchum. K. E. T. C. H. U. M. She has like DNA diagnostics done in Texas, but we just, we went to a genetic lab recently with some, um, some hair from that back when that whole thing that, you know, the, the video he told you about the video with a 10 foot big foot walks up to the dumpster.

Speaker 3:          00:45:27       The things about 10 foot. Yeah. Where was this? Um, Oklahoma. We got, I never got to see, but I don't, I, we know people that have seen it and they didn't get to see it. Why haven't you gotten to see it? It's, it's, it's locked in the vault and the tribal chairman won't, won't really, it won't let anyone even see it anymore because what happened was word leaked out. There was a big foot, there was Bigfoot's anybody. You go to this place in Oklahoma, it's what they traveled. The river routes. They follow the rivers. There's thick brush and bogs along the rivers and they've traveled that especially at night and this casino was near. It was near enough to that. They'd come up there and they're, they're real cut around natives because natives don't shoot that. I'm very odd. It's rare for a native to shoot at a squash.

Speaker 3:          00:46:05       They respectfully leave them alone. They'll put out food for him and leave is what they do. They don't have any photos of him either. Some, some have the upper up in Humboldt, there was a family of some local Indians that shot footage. It's about from 400 yards away and it's looking down there. They were out scouting elk and it's a female was feeding down in the, in the bottom some kind of vegetative matter. I'm not sure whether it was eating, but she was digging something up. Like it might've been some kind of root and they filmed it for like 13, 14 minutes. But you know, it's like 400 yards away with the things, probably about seven foot tall and 400 pounds. So this woman who Ms Ketchum, who's uh, doing this, this, this study, uh, it's, she's apparently putting it out for peer review. Is that what's going on? Yeah. So she's made the peer reviews going on the, yeah. Or her conclusions are done. The peer review is going on right now in Oxford University is one of the labs. It's in on the DNA study now. There's, um, I can't say, I mean that's their deal. I can't, I can't say, um, what other labs are doing it. But you'll, you would know the names. There's a, there's a big public university, one of the guys who runs the genetic park department's doing it and, and their, their initial results or they're blown away.

Speaker 3:          00:47:23       There's a picture of a big foot back. It's the best picture. I think that was fake. It's a fig. I Dunno,

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       I might not be. I think it is.

Speaker 1:          00:47:33       What if big foot slips were born very big and they only like, we're big for like one day and they grew really small hole. Shut the fuck up now nigger backwards or something just broke every person's brain who's listening to this thing they're not from or dare you be. So your, your first encounter came after you were already obsessed with big foot. Totally. What became, what started it off? How did you become obsessed? I told you my story. I talked to a trapper and he told me it was real. Then I was really freaked out.

Speaker 4:          00:48:09       I saw the Patterson Gulen film, like on some TV show when I was about five, because I remember I, I had just started kindergarten and I could get, uh, I could take books out at school. At that point I was looking for bigfoot bucks and it just, just caught you like you would just mess with it. Yeah. And then, um, I was, that I grew up down here, I was a surfer and all that, and, you know, skate punk. And, uh, after high school I was going to, I was doing it, I was piloting outer can is if, you know those Hawaiian canoes, outriggers. I was racing those and we were like the top team in the country and you know, doing like world championships and all that stuff. So I stayed down here longer, but I was wanting me to humble because I was in a surfing.

Speaker 4:          00:48:49       I like big waves and there was big foot and big surf up there and I was like, man, places killer. I'm going there. So I moved up there and I started, uh, did some logging jobs and started meeting people in the community and worked with some natives and Kinda got in more and more. I just really started delving into, like, if I heard about a report, I'd go check it out. Um, talk to whoever I could. I'd like big foot shirts or hats I'd, wherein people country to go believe in big foot, you know, you know, I'd say yeah, they'd say, uh, I saw on one time he like, it was crazy how many people you got in rural areas, how many people, and it's, there's so many, there's so much hard data form, like where you live with the sightings are, it's generally 90%, 90 plus percent of the sightings, over 90% of the settings are, you can fall. It's like a, you look at it where there's 20 inches of rainfall or more like theirs. That's where they live. Yeah. Yeah. And there's like, there's a bell curve. What you'd see, what the natural occurring animal for like foot size. Um, without God, I should have brushed up on this. He said, I said to think about saying something stupid on the front of the camera. When I'm doing big foot step at a,

Speaker 1:          00:49:55       well, there's a lot of possible a, you know, when you, when you, as soon as you start saying you believe in big foot, it's going to, it's impossible to, you know, to have everybody take you seriously. Right. You know, let's fuck those people there. They're the wrong, well, eventually it's going to, if it, if it is a real thing, someone's going to get something conclusive. Right. And they're able to justify, well, what's the most, what's the most conclusive thing besides the Patterson footage that I think it's bullshit that just the enormous amount of footprints that have been cast for the folks on Ustream. He brought me a, uh, a replica of the best footprint and it's fucking awesome if that really is a, a from an animal. Holy Shit. Is that think big.

Speaker 3:          00:50:33       Yeah. And I'm actually, I got a, I got a copy of the ha it left a knuckle mark to where it stepped up over a, um, uh, like a four foot step up. It went up and put its knuckles on the ground. I got that out in the car check at Shea, but she, those little ridge patterns, only living flashlights like those red, a cutout foot or like a fiberglass mold would not leave that ridge pattern in that moisture. Right. This all this stuff right here. The national flag. Yeah. Yeah. I mean any tracker I'll tell you that.

Speaker 1:          00:51:00       Wow. So this you think is a for sure. Legit big foot footprint.

Speaker 3:          00:51:05       Oh yeah. It's considered the best one. It's the best one without clear journals. And that was cast by a deputy Hereford and graves county, Washington. And when you say

Speaker 1:          00:51:13       creek cleared dermal is for folks who don't know, that's one of the most conclusive pieces of evidence for the people that the scientific community that support the idea of a giant primate is dermal ridges that you have like similar to fingerprints, you know, you have those, uh, on the bottom of your foot. And these, these animals actually leave these in some of the tracks, which would be incredibly difficult to replicate.

Speaker 3:          00:51:37       Do they? Jimmy Chilcott, he, he talked the FBI labs in Quantico, Virginia. Like when you go through the academy, he's the latent fingerprint expert, blah, blah. Well, they were trying to see like when they found just a, like a gun at a murder scene, there's prints on it and that just no matches that he was the guy that you used for 15 years. He went around and fingerprinted and footprinted every prime it, he couldn't zoos research labs and printed thousands of gorillas, orangutans, monkeys, chimpanzees, blah, blah Gibbons. And uh, so after all this time it was because since they have a smaller gene pool, they don't interbreed was the idea was they were trying to see, was there any pattern discernible, like Asians are Africans or Europeans or native Americans. Like if they just found a gun with a fingerprint, was there any thing that would, that would show it's from like what race?

Speaker 3:          00:52:32       At least it was right. And the answer was no. But as a result of that study, he became the world's leading expert on primate compensate us. Wrong, dramatic, dramatic God. Dramatic Lipsticks, dermal ridges. It's terrible. Yeah. Right. Can I get a little tongue tied of them? Some of that stuff. But, uh, I can spell it, but, um, and so anyways, he's testified in court for like smuggling cases, you know, people bring it in, they'll say, no, the sound was born here and he'll, he can go ahead and show the fingerprints Bot. And so he studied the tracks and he's, and this guy has put people away in over 400 capital cases. He was the expert witness is where the evidence was fingerprints. And he went on on discovery channel and said, I stake my professional reputation and name on that. These are genuine. There's an undiscovered primate leaving these tracks. And even when people are saying like, well, you just opened up like, you know yourself to like have it like, or these 400 you've gotten. Now

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       the defense lawyers could say, this guy is crazy. What? Right. And he goes, I can prove it in court. So he's not even worried about it and it hasn't, he hasn't had to, but he said he could. The, uh, what's interesting to me is, uh, the idea that there could be an undiscovered animal, uh, and that, uh, someone someday is going to bring it in just like they have with this, uh, the big chimpanzee that was a ledge. Congo. It's called a bondo actually, but no bowls or the, the little ones like regular, like a cousin to regular champion. They fuck a lot. They're horny ones. Bondo apes are these giant chimps or ability, Billy. Yeah. Billy. Yeah. Yeah. They're um, in a part of the Congo, um, which really, really fucking hard to get to. And since the 19 hundreds, there was stories of these big giant, great chimps and that was from the Michael Crighton movie, the Congo, they actually depicted these things in there, these big giant, and they'll walk, try peatal sometimes.

Speaker 1:          00:54:27       Yeah. Yeah. This is a, they're called lion killers when the day of time. Exactly. Yeah. They have two words for champs. They called him tree beaters or lion killers and there's some chips. They have photos of dead ones. I mean these are real legit 100% real primates that are still a like very, very controversial. It's, it's still, there's a lot of people that didn't know they existed until the 90s were weren't sure Til Karma. Carl Armand, Jose, a Swiss wildlife photographer, he, he um, got some evidence, some bones and some stuff and then became obsessed with it and started going there. But he has camera trap photos of them. They have a total of 2000. Exactly. Exactly. They brought back some classroom casts like those that weren't even as good as this. Right. And there's more, there's more evidence for Sasquatch than those. Then those Billy apes really well.

Speaker 1:          00:55:16       There's actual real good photographs, these gaps. So high hazard there is. Um, but the, but the point is that for the longest time people were saying, and this was bullshit and now they know 100% that this is real. And the Congo as people living in it, you know, ain't nobody live in when these guys there too much. So up in that area, they're just pushing in. Now, you know, there's still tons of virgin timber. They're cutting down up there and that the Congo so huge too. Another thing that people don't realize it's, it's like literally almost as dense as the entire distance between California and New York. Like the, that there's that much Congo fucking enormous. I noticed that. Yeah. I might be wrong about the contract with the Congo, Congo, the Congo, Congo River, bass jungle, the, the, the rain, right. Talk about the country. But yeah, the Congo base, that, that animal being something that was mythological and now is a real thing. There's that give you guys hope. Does that like make big, big foot people like, oh yeah. See Bitch, you could see this some shit out there that you couldn't find. I used to be pretty militant, like sometimes

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       violent and my defense of the Sasquatch existence, but I don't even worry about it. I've seen him and I know, I know there's enough tissue samples and they're now getting exam. There's so much going on. Um, there's a lot of hair experts getting in on the hair cause it, uh, I'm not sure what exactly what it is, but some about the platelets where they line up, they've gotten better microscopes or something that they can see him better. I'm not sure what it is, but the, um, these hair experts are getting really into the Sasquatch here because it's unique. There's nothing that matches it at and it's, and there's the, um, there's just certain characteristics about Sasquatch or it's like every sample that's legitimately it's handed in and it's not, it doesn't try to be horse or bear or whatever, but every sound gets turned in has these same characteristics. And there's a, there's a joint study going on, like different experts in that field who are working around like from different countries even that are all examine these hairs and like marking these markers and, and uh, it's like they're real excited about it. You know, it's really going to be interesting when the skies are filled with drones and drones can take images of anything, anywhere they want at anytime and they just fucking send them over the Pacific northwest.

Speaker 6:          00:57:34       They already kind of have that with everyone having cell phones. That's just the thing that I just don't understand if, if there's so many people that see this and there, there's still no photos and then there's photos and like the hair, the hair and the blood and everything like that. I know that it doesn't take that long for it to get the, you know, for them to say, you know, this is deer blood, this is so and so blood that this is something. But, but if they're all saying that it's unknown, then why are you, have they, has there been multiple agencies that have put out reports about this or is there any, you know, these teams you're talking about sun like, like, like, like if there's been so many blood samples and hair samples and they're, they're all being tested and they can't find out what this blood is because they could, it doesn't take that long for them to take blood and go, this is deer blood, you know, so, so if they're all saying like, hey, we don't know what this blood is. Have they been giving out like statements or press reports or you know, stuff about this. Is there, is there information out there about them saying, we don't know what this blood is?

Speaker 4:          00:58:37       Yeah, there is, but you got understand is like the science world is so political and so backstabbing and so, and they're so afraid to like do something unconventional cause you just get barred in the field that they're real reticent to like do stuff like that. But there are some that have like Dr Fehrenbach and some others that have, and there's others that look at it and they won't, there's a lot of people who work in the bigfoot field anonymously, like other scientists that collaborate with them that just don't want to deal with any ridicule or get not get promoted or whatever it may be. Yeah. I watched a documentary where a doctor, uh, some sort of a professor at a university was talking about, um, the fact that even though he supports big foot, he does it very reluctantly. He supports the idea big foot exists.

Speaker 4:          00:59:21       It goes because quite honestly, until one's discovered it until there's conclusive proof. He says it's just a point of ridicule. It's just one of those things. Talk about Doctor Meldrum and auto state. I don't know where he's from. Uh, he's, and he's just, he's a genius. He's written like four books on the foot anatomy, how humans have gone from Quad, how like back, you know, evolution, how we went from Quadrat pad to buy pedal. He's like the foremost expert guy in the world on that. And um, he was actually one of the guys at the body recovery site with us when we went up in there and he, he believes that he believes the shooter story also. He was there like everyone that goes there, that guy. Yeah. Everyone that was there, that, that's there that week came away. Believe in him. Why did he bring something back?

Speaker 4:          01:00:04       It's silly. I'll tell you later off the air. Okay. All right. Well there's some sort of a secret, ladies and gentlemen and I can't share with you. That might be the answer to this whole crazy. It just would answer some a little bit. Well they were, they were, they were pounding beers and they had just saw that word and a guy and they didn't want to like they were, they have a drive to get back to camp and they had it, they, the dude was afraid to get uh, like a DUI or something cause they, you know, whatever, we're out in the woods like, you know, just drinking beers, driving around out the track, whatever it was described. And those are the guys that shot a pig foot baby. I know. Well the only the one guy did, the other guy was anti the whole time.

Speaker 4:          01:00:47       And other than that, like what is a, what is a good piece of evidence that someone could look at Freeman footage? Freeman footage. I'm convinced that's real Freeman footage. What is Freeman footage? Fall Freeman was, uh, he was, uh, the mill creek watershed up in the Blue Mountains, northeast Oregon and southeast Washington. Um, there's this huge area, like a lot of municipalities have their own water districts and they'll, they'll own like, you know, tens of thousands of acres of watershed land and you're not allowed up in there. Cause it's a water supply. They don't want like diesel in it or anything. And he was the patrol guy up in there and he was seeing big foot's find their tracks and actually seeing them in the day light up there. So we started carrying a video camera and he got footage of that and I'm 100% convinced that real Brion pull that shit up. Freeman big foot footage.

Speaker 4:          01:01:34       This is from the 90s yeah. And then he has another clip that he wouldn't, he died, he got diabetes and died young but about 15 years ago. But he has another clip where he falls down and starts screaming kind of cry and it gets bluff charged for when he gets it real close to the big mail comes up at, I'm like full guerrilla style charge and he got footage of it and he never released it because a, he looks so bad and it, you know, he got pissed his pants or something. I just saw something in the woods and those tracks are authenticated.

Speaker 7:          01:02:18       Do you see much here? Here I hear the brush popping and stuff.

Speaker 4:          01:02:30       Oh well there you go. But keep watching. You're up here. Yeah, it's pretty, yeah. From watching these videos, like whenever I think I've, um, potentially I don't want a big foot. I never take the camera off.

Speaker 7:          01:03:05       I don't know one thing. When it costs got up there to probably drop it on the ground, it shouldn't be here.

Speaker 4:          01:03:29       Does he see it again or is that, I don't think so. What makes you convince it that's real? Just like the size of it and the way it moves. People went back up there and said it was well over seven and a half feet tall. I dunno where the comparison video is for it, but people did go up there and then right after that they ended up clear cutting that whole thing. I'm putting like a campground right there that they're actually staking out. There's like some ribbons, you can see that flag tie on a couple of the trees and it was marked for being turned into a campground. That to me looks way better than the Wright Patterson or the Roger Roger Patterson footage. Just because, uh, it's not as clear anything about the Patterson given filaments. You're seeing the copies you've seen on TV or like every time they make a clone copy, and this is like 30%, 30% resolution for the Chris on the original Patterson, the original footage piece, which no one knows where it is now.

Speaker 4:          01:04:28       Probably Al Adley has it is really clear, clear than the Oh, what you see on TV a lot. Like um, nat geo did a good digit digitization of it and they um, they've shown that that's the, that's like the clearest version you can get now. But like the stuff you'd see on TV back in the day, you, it'd be all blurry. It wasn't, the original is not blurry. Who's this Guy Bob Herana must. It says that he was a Douche bag alcoholic. I just a liar Gibbons neighbor. It's like, dude, okay. You know what? The whole Kennedy assassinations over I, I'm the one that shot Kennedy. It was me case closed. So he's just some crazy dude is trying to take, he's not crazy. He's just an asshole. She's kind of a day's pretty much pretty. She move out. It really was a big foot. If it really was a, a video

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       of a live Sasquatch and this motherfuckers running around pretending that he was a part of a hoax.

Speaker 4:          01:05:22       Well, he, he's, there's a, I'm this guy, if you're into this, you can look it up Roger night, but, um, I forgot what it's called. And he wrote like a 74 page thing where he interviewed Hieronymus it went through and tore apart his story, all his, he's made like five different statements about how the costume was constructed.

Speaker 1:          01:05:38       Well, Gimlin said that it was possible that it was a hoax. He said he was older. He says, I was totally convinced no one could fool me. And of course, I'm an older man now and I think there could have been the possibility of a hoax, but it would have had to have been really well planned by Roger.

Speaker 4:          01:05:54       I told him, he said, he's, I just, I've talked about, I was just with Bob this weekend. He's the raddest I swear to God did, he's, he was, uh, he was one of the first guys are evil Knievel. He was like a dare devil guy. Like, he's just a raft guide and salt of the earth. And we are asking about that. And he said, the way the questioning was going, he was just getting bored, whether badgered when it, he said, yeah, there's always a possibility you could be hugs. And he's like, I know what I saw. The thing was, I was looking at it at eye level for my horse. They, when they wrote their, there's B roll footage, you know, they ride the horse next to the tracks and the horse prints are not going as deep as those footprints. Really? Yeah. What, what do you think these fucking things eat?

Speaker 4:          01:06:36       Everything. Everything. A berries. Um, they're omnivores. They, you know, they're there. They'd have obviously have a high caloric intake to be that big. And so in the wintertime they probably eat more meats like bill, they'll hunt deer. Elk Don't, they'll even have bear black bear. They hunt them. Yeah, they, they use tools to the youth. Sometimes. We've seen that some evidence where they've, um, or the elk, the flesh deer, elk out of a metal, they'll come running. It'll take the same routes every time. And one will be on the, like one o' rore at one side, like hundreds and said they'd been up, you know, bow hunters creeping up on a, on a little herd in the med or something else and that just God awful roar, scream, come from one side, they all run into their side and there was wack, you know, and I'm just seeing like where they'll just take a club and as a deer go run and by this club in the front legs and shatter their front legs and then go over and break.

Speaker 4:          01:07:28       They'll break their neck when they kill and they break their neck. So they kill them with objects. They used the monetizer, he's log or something and you know, I think most of us use their bare hands then. Um, they're that big. They would their bare hands, oh, easy, easy. They'll pick them up, they'll, they'll, they'll take a full grown up. It's looking over their shoulder and walk off with it. Jesus Christ. Like I've heard so many stories like do not do that electronic bullshit and be like, you know, just people tell what they saw and they, you know, obviously there's something that you could go that guy's full of shit or whatever, but I'm not like genuine people that you're talking about just going like, this guy's not shitting me and you hear these stories and I've never seen him cause I've, I've only seen one really moving good.

Speaker 4:          01:08:07       And I was at night, it was on the hickory again, the hickory Apache reservation. How many times have you seen big foot? Probably a half dozen. Half dozen. Only time in the daylight. And I didn't see it. It was just stand there and I turned, my head was gone and I didn't see it again. That's what I smelled real good. And then I'm the one at Hickory. I saw 2004 it came, walked, we had all these infrared cameras and stuff planted the tree line and it walked across the South Alpha field and came into our camp. Everyone was down to fires, kind of spread out camp. We were at the chief of police for the WHO's according to, for all law enforcement on the Hickory, Apache, Rez and we were on his property and no one's cute. This deal was a bad ass. He got in trouble for being a little too, uh, you know, he'd beat the shit out of people you like.

Speaker 4:          01:08:51       Like if he couldn't, couldn't prove some guy broken as some old lady's house, you know, it's a razor. When those terms, it's going on everyone, this guy's on math, whatever, you know, he's stealing. And if he couldn't prove, like if he couldn't catch the guy, he would just take him outside and beat the shit out of like one of those guys. So no one's coming up. This guy's ranch, he was the very end ranch then it was a continental divide behind there and it went from like 25 miles to the next set of houses. And uh, this thing came from the continental divide side came walking up and I didn't see it walk up. I, I wasn't aware of it until we had this guy who was a special forces colonel and the special forces. Dr. Guy, not Jamie, the guy I was with when I saw the one that I'm beloved night and I thought it was him dressed all in black and just weren't because it was below freezing.

Speaker 4:          01:09:33       We're like 9,000 feet and I thought it was him. I'll bundle it up wearing like a Parker's, I wasn't sure, but it was all black eye. I was going to let you doing cause I could hear fingernails going down the side of a tent like it was. She like that fabric just we'll figure it out. Isn't that fabric sound nylon and it was going around the tent and it got over to the front where the, it was our bait tent where we're keeping all the food we were putting out for bait was that it was, it was new and then I'm like why? Because it walked. I get up for a second and show you. Yeah, I was watching it for a while and I had night vision or I had night vision around my neck and I didn't cause you don't want to be like the creek, like get caught staring at someone through night vision at night, you know.

Speaker 4:          01:10:11       So I didn't even look, I thought it was just a one of us walk like a man except for it. Um, there's walking like a man, but it looked like he looked like he was looking on the ground for something. But I think it was was in hindsight knowing how careful they are about where they step, not to step when they leave. They're real conscious not to leave tracks like that for the most part. And it was, I think it was looking at where it was stepping so it wouldn't step in and lead a print, but it was just walking so it needs to step in like mud or something like that to me was walking the walk and walk like this the whole time. But they would kneel down like just get on one knee like that and mess around the front of the tent and they want to go to this tab.

Speaker 4:          01:10:49       The only girl that was kind of there was going to hurt Ted going back. It's hard for people to hear you when you saw him. This is going back and forth and I watched it for about five minutes and the moon was coming. There was almost a full, I can't remember exact man. And uh, it was walking and then the moon was just about to hit the field. It was an old Alfalfa field this guy had and he would plan it, but the deer and elk were so thick up there. He just up and let them eat it. He just quit farming and there's Alfalfa ground for like, like a hundred acres. And so, uh, this thing walked back across the village as a moon that was coming down and just walk profiles. I thought it was the colonel. I go back down to camp and I was going and uh, they were like, was that you throwing rocks?

Speaker 4:          01:11:29       Pebbles at us there. Pebbles being thrown down by the guys and they thought it was me. And like if you're a squashy not screaming like you don't do like, hey that's fool this guy or you just don't do shit like that if you're out or you'll get banned, you know, wants to go out there if you're a squatter. Is that what you said, the verb or that I thought you went instead. You were, I thought you were saying if you were a squatch like saying here's you throw rocks at people. Yeah. Yeah. And so I'll just finish real quick. It walked away and I got it back on and everyone's there had this guy that was bigger than me go stand. By the time I went back to my original position, he was walking around the tents and I didn't you just something seven foot or like six and a half foot.

Speaker 4:          01:12:06       It's not real clear. Like I didn't, I wasn't, I hadn't made mental notes. How exactly did these tents where in a, someone was walking around how big they look in scale. So, but when I saw this guy was about six, five or so down there walking around the tent, he was just warped by this thing and it wasn't that much taller, maybe like you know, six, nine, seven foot. But just the bull. It was just easily twice the way to him or more easily at least. Where'd this thing go? It walked back and just walk straight across the meadow and in the moonlight just as it walked past him and that popped up and started hitting that whole area and it just went back in the woods. It, my dad who was a total skeptic, he came out there just you know, camp for a week and they have like a father son trip.

Speaker 4:          01:12:48       He actually heard them like talking and uh, not, not at right then, but then, uh, the night before that he'd heard them talking like a couple of them up there and they were actually Hawkin they do like to his gym. Ever heard the Sierra sounds? No, I got in the car, I'll burn you a copy of these guys got hours of recordings in the Sierra, Nevada's of them chattering away and those things are being translated by military translators right now. There's a, there's a breakthrough on that front too. There's all kinds of breakthroughs going down. Right. So this, this sound that they make it, was it anything like with this other guy was talking about the guy who says he shot a baby. He, they were like mumbling like almost like death. Yay. They sound like they were profoundly deaf. I've heard him do this a few times and it sounds like to me what it sounded like to me it was kind of like maybe like a monkey trying to talk Chinese something, something like that.

Speaker 4:          01:13:41       You know that's funny. Monkey to tongue chain. Yeah. But like more grumbly though, like more wall and I've heard the low mumble, they mumble like, so the idea is that they have a language or they just, all the natives and he talked to any native anywhere will tell you the yeah, they have language and they can understand certain words. We say they can understand. Certain words were saying, but we don't have a video of the one of these things. We don't have to do. The Patterson gave one the freemen yeah, but they could be bullshit. They I, okay. Freeman, I'm not so sure, but I can tell you for, yeah, there's been a, and there's other breaks. Who's going down on the patterns and Gaylen film? What does it break throughs? Um, they've actually found some of the original trees that were back behind. There's been so much regrowth that these guys, this guy is, he's the State Park Ranger.

Speaker 4:          01:14:31       Check the range of cop up there for Humboldt redwoods, him Robert Letter. And then another guy, Steve Stroop hurt the guy owns big foot books, sir. And Willow Creek has spent two years going out there and going over the site and finding an actually found from the original trees that are obscured. You can't see him from the creek pay more cause it's been, it's been 43 years or whatever, 45. And, um, they're all grown up and uh, they've found trees in the background that one of the original PG fell. So we're going to go there and, and uh, with all this like three d laser scanning stuff, they're gonna be able to get three dimensional, three dimensional view of the whole of the whole creek. Go back in and plugging the PG films, like overlay it and they'll get a three dimensional, like to like a half inch. How big, how big the subject from the film is? Well what if it's only five 10, then what do you do if it's only five 10?

Speaker 4:          01:15:22       I Dunno, I just don't see that happening. I don't know. You know, I don't know. I Trust Bob, you know, cause Bob Gilman is a really good friend of mine. He was himself said, but you said that he was badgered and he'll tell you he loved this guy. He would love to hang out. And then I would, I mean I believe him, I'm not saying he's full of Shit, but that there's been a lot says no way. He said there's no way. He said it had to be over 500 pounds. And he this guy's expert hunter, and he's like watching the muscles. There's like nine different muscle than men she can see in the video. Yeah, but isn't that possible? You just put some fake mussels on it. Dude. The Guy Chambers that made the planet of the apes back in the 60s when that was made, said he could not do that.

Speaker 4:          01:16:02       He could not. He went to his death. That's it. Cause there was always a rumor that he did it and he was just like, nope. Was, I'd never did it. He goes, I wish I could have done that. And you're talking about two cowboys. You'd, Roger was unemployed at the time, coming up with mate. Roger did buy a costume from, um, his name was Phillip, his name was last name was Morris out in North Carolina. He made a gorilla suit and he did say shitty $400 gorilla suit. And it was for recreation's in his, in his documentary. And that's not the suit that he wore in. So anyways, there's, there's, there's controversy around it for sure, but there's always people looking to like, I just wish there was some better shit. Oh, we all do. And you know, there's some footage it's going to be coming out.

Speaker 4:          01:16:40       The con that's in conjunction with the DNA study. It's called the Kentucky footage and I only seen part of it, but people that have seen it say it's, it's the real deal. There's a face shot. How many do you think are alive? If you had to, if you had to guess, well, we're going to start getting some hard evidence on that due to the DNA samples. But I would say their camp people say there's got to be at least 2000 just to have as many as there are in North America. And you're talking Canada and Canada's big to, I'd say my guess would be probably four to 6,000 in North America. How the fuck are there four to 6,000 things and no one has a good night. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Because for one thing, did your shit. You're looking at some giant eight managers shitting your pants, people free sort.

Speaker 4:          01:17:25       Do they make sleep? They definitely go to Kay's and extreme weather. Really cold, real hot. Um, native state where we live, they use these. There's, there'll be fires in southern Humboldt and smoke pops out in southern Oregon, you know, 150 miles away as the k's are all connected. Oh really? Yeah, the knee. It's the biggest cave complex in the world. That's, but that wouldn't explain everywhere, but that's pretty bad ass. Yeah. You're talking on the Sangamon? Yeah. Thanks. Okay. I didn't know about that. That's interesting. So they sleep in case they all than it is telling us that they bury their dead and caves and we'll like pilot with rocks just to put big rocks. No Man could move in, in places where machinery is going to go either. And those cover the cave up. There's, we need to find out where the fuck those caves are and dig them up and find some big foot bones.

Speaker 4:          01:18:11       That's what we were going to do with those cadaver dogs is because we knew like, um, if that was the male that was shot, um, because the, the rumor going around is that was the mom, but the DNA shows it was a male was the father. Hmm. So maybe it was the grandpa urban grandpa, whatever old and fucked up stover. No muscle tone. We'll see. We'll see. So anyways, if we could have got those, I'm sure. I can't imagine them. It was as big as you said it was. I couldn't see them carrying it more than a mile or two, you know, from there and then find it. And there was cliffs down the backside. There was other cave interest is around who they know that area, like no one else. And who knows where they put it. But I can't imagine them carrying a 600 pound carcass that far.

Speaker 4:          01:18:54       Right. But you got to assume too that you remember that movie grizzly man love it. Great movie where the Dude, uh, they, they shot at Grizzly and uh, when they, uh, came back just a, I think it was a couple months later, there was nothing. Oh, right, right. Little tiny pieces of bone. You know what I mean? Even a, a 600 lbs Sasquatch or something. If you left the bone behind in the jungle or in the woods right there, it's not going to last for long because this is all the ecosystem. A whole cycle setup. Like people say, well, where's the dead ones? Well, where's the dead mountain lions? We know there's mountain lions. Okay. And Mountain Lions live way closer to people and civilization. I mean, they have like at the edge, they could kill the mountain. Mine in Santa Monica for months ago, there was a mountain mind siting in my neighborhood a couple of weeks ago.

Speaker 4:          01:19:40       There's mountain lions, they're the tiger that got loose stuff off the one oh one that's 600 pounds, orange tiger run. It ran loose for three and a half weeks in a six by two and a half mile stretch of, of, you know, up there. They had helicopters. They brought in the six best track. They brought in the six best tracking teams from fish and game with their dogs in all of California came in, but it was raining. It was winter. I don't often from it was raining, but they look for that Bangle Tiger for three weeks right there off the, off the freeway and you know, between Malibu and the valley and couldn't find it until it walked up to somebody. His backyard was staring at her poodle to what a fucking terrifying look. That must have been looking for a giant Bengal tiger that hasn't eaten in a week or two weeks or whatever the hell it is.

Speaker 4:          01:20:26       And it's wandering around. So every corner you turn, that might be it every time you go down a back alley. That might be it. Do we just, we were just in a tiger preserve and Sumatra looking for the Orang. Pendek well that's a, that's a, uh, a different sort of totally different. Totally smaller. Way Smaller. Yeah. And they're not related. I don't, well, you know, we're all related at some point. Pit. And is there evidence of this thing dude there that that is like that's the, that have all cryptids that's the one that all scientists agree is did the lady that runs the UN program down there for like wow serve it. She's seen it three times. Really? Yeah. And what did she say it is? It's some kind of upright orangutan that walks on two feet. It's about a meter tall or so, but up to like 200 like maybe three, 300 feet tall.

Speaker 4:          01:21:08       200 pounds. Ball of muscle. Whoa. Yeah. And so we were up there at night and uh, that, that we couldn't like we couldn't get to the locals about the porters. They were scared to death go out cause those tires, they are their managers. They'll eat the tigers. Yeah. Yeah. We were out there at night looking for a ring pin decks and the, so you guys went out at night in the tire preserve. You did Jesus fucking Christ. What were you thinking? That's crazy. I was thinking it's going to take money maker. Do you think it was going to get him first? How's hoping, why is he the slow one Florida day slower than everybody slow compared to what tiger man, uh, you know, they said, I said, well, we're in a big group. Like the last guy out here, like the month before, whatever they were walking in a group that went out to a group of 15 people and it jumped right in the middle of land.

Speaker 4:          01:21:54       I got crushed. His skull ran off to the guy dead. Well, you know what he did once this, I do a bit about it. In my act, there was a boat and I d I forgot how many guys were in the boat, but this tiger swam out to the boat three times, killed three fucking pizza up before it, got tired of doing it, swam out, climbed in the boat, killed a guy, dragged his bottom shore, jumped back in the mortar, swam out to the boat, killed another guy, and they're just rolling like a motherfucker trying to get away from this thing. They just get bored. Just one night, just one day hunt. They hunt those boats. I mean those are those legal would guys and they have those guys get more, they get eaten all the time. They could swim like a motherfucker. I did not know that they could swim like that are the aquatic cat. It's a scary animal man. They're gnarlier than polar bears. Yeah, they're right up there. Yeah. The thing about polar bears though is that did just start eating you. They don't kill you first. A tiger at least has the, the good grace crush your windpipe and then take you out quick. Polar bears eat you dick first. They just start chewing on any part that could hold down just like a salmon. You were saying something crazy before that you have to leave salmon out for Sasquatch is in some places

Speaker 5:          01:23:06       they throw rocks at you.

Speaker 3:          01:23:07       Yeah, like when you talk to the ne I, my thing was always go to the tribes and talking to as many elders as I could. That would most of it's changed now more and more. There. A lot of dealers that talked to me now say the kids, they're like, they're all on a hip hop, like NBA, like don't give a shit about any of the traditions or the storage of that knowledge and they just want to be like it. They want to be Westernized. Totally. And um, so the, they'll they've dealt, they said they would never tell. They were told, never tell white people, but they'll tell me, cause I'm respectful, this subject and I'm into it and I'm listening. What you hear is you'll hear all these things like, well my grandma was around, they used to do this or they used to do that. But the one thing that he's still do up and down the whole Pacific coast from California to Alaska is the ne you talked to any of those net pores when they, they put the Gillnets cross the rivers when they pull the nets. And if they don't put a salmon up on the bank, on the other bank for the squatch that it'll come down, throw rocks at him or pull the net in and take all the fit.

Speaker 5:          01:24:03       Well, what they should do then is do that and then bring cameras. Don't leave the May salmon and bring cameras and boom, you got Sasquatch. It seems like they, they bait them. They want them to get this food. It's an offering. Right. But they don't, they don't, they almost never almost never see him take it. They'll only take it when you're not there. But you know, set up cameras, set up some cameras, leave a fish. That seems like the easiest way in the world. They're Jed eyes mad like they, it's so crazy. We don't know if it's the electromagnetic field around things they pick up on, but they are hip to a lot of, but they have walked in front of game cameras before and stuff. So they have, yeah, we just, there's some game count photos out there. Really. The work I work at, I find those camera photos. I didn't have one this coming to just said

Speaker 8:          01:24:45       and when the other day what I want on my phone.

Speaker 5:          01:24:50       Yep. Big Flood was one of the first things that Google pulled up. Isn't that funny? Game camera photos. Big Foot was one of the very first things. You know why Google knows I'm a retard. I see. It says you're a smart guy. Oh, there's one that's totally fake as fuck. Well, most of them are. We just saw, I don't think this one is on the Internet yet. This guy, oh, this one's tripping. This one looks like a monkey. That's like a, like a four.

Speaker 8:          01:25:15       Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:25:16       Like something on four legs. That's fake. It's fake. Yeah. No, they have to walk on two legs or they're not real. They're not legitimate. They go on for sometimes for sure. They'll knock a walk. Especially the young ones. Yeah. Some of these like really fake God.

Speaker 8:          01:25:30       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:25:30       Which ones do you, how do you discern whether they're fake or real?

Speaker 8:          01:25:34       MMM.

Speaker 5:          01:25:36       God, I wish I could get ahold of cliff and have him send you one right now. A lot of the best ones do. People don't, you'd be surprised. Most people aren't looking for fame and fortune. Like with this, the most of the stuff that gets caught of the, we're going, we went to the Mongolian room. Do you know, you talk about, you know the Pacific northwest, the fifth largest pine forest in North America is in Arizona. Really? Yeah. The Mongolian rim. That's where this is.

Speaker 8:          01:26:00       Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:26:00       Well this might have even been the video we did.

Speaker 8:          01:26:01       No. What,

Speaker 5:          01:26:04       what are you slowing down to? Quarter speed. What is this? I won't say Shit. It's hard when we take something from Youtube, um, put her, I I, I'm not even sure that all the footage, that's what big foot and none of it's in like the HD or anything like that. It's always like this, you know, we're really low quality. How convenient. You know, it's funny dude, is that the best DNA sample from Asia came from destination truth, you know that TV show destination truth. Yeah. It's kind of Hokey. Whatever. They just aired it I think the Vietnam episode and we're going to work, our team's going to go there because the thing ran past the camera man at the base camp ran right by him on the side, like a big eight footer and they got four good footprint cast cause it's stepped in mud a couple of spots.

Speaker 5:          01:26:53       And Really? Yeah, they got d, that's the, this is destination truth. Yeah, the Vietnam side, I think it just aired last night or the night before or something. I don't know. I was on, I was up in the mountains so I wasn't, and it's a big foot. It's a Vietnamese when they call them rock ape. So The v the non, that's called them rock caves. Because you're worried about that Vietnamese big foot. No, I've never heard a rock. So did you talk to him and Brock came, talked to a whole alert guys or any of those? All the non like the Ford Ranger guys and the, you know, behind the enemy lines. Got even even guys, just regular army guys, when they're up in the northeast, like in the [inaudible] territory, they the rocks and throw apes out and they call them rock caves. They throw rocks at him. They found several footprints and they also caught something on thermal imaging that um, might have been a bipedal creature.

Speaker 5:          01:27:41       It says, however, in the end, Gates couldn't be sure that they found evidence of a Bot. Toot, toot. Some of they say it. That's not, but to toot, which led, uh, some viewers to vent their frustrations on Twitter. Well, people vent their frustrations on Twitter and I'm minute of what you'd do. I only want to read Twitter after all the what ifs that we've thrown in today on the big foot front. Just for the smart people. They can't Miss Kate. I don't have a smart filter. I need a smart filter for Twitter. Uh, Nah, he, the idiots are very, they should have their say to homes was not constant. Right. I honestly don't, I don't read any reviews. I don't read, I don't read anything. I don't look at any of those big foot websites. I don't really, how come? It's just, you know, it's like you must get tired of people saying that you crazy big foot's fake.

Speaker 5:          01:28:31       Cause like I said that I was going to talk to you about this today because uh, all my life, like I said, I've, I've read so many books on big foot, I've watched so many documentaries are always been fascinated by it. Immediately people were like, who can big foods? Food, food, can big foods foods? Like, no you don't. No big foot's fake. He just, I used to Dick, you want everything to be negative, you fuck right. And there was a lot of, well you know, it's like when people say, well I think that this is my third. It's like, like I've said to this thing for like, you know, over 30 years and have spent 25 years looking in the field actively. And I mean I know that real, I've seen it for myself, I've heard him, I've talked to thousands of people that have seen him that are legitimate.

Speaker 5:          01:29:13       I mean I've seen him myself, I know the real so that when people go, well I think this last time hap right. And they just thought of it in five minutes and it's like, well that's like me going to some like, you know, astrophysicist guy in a lab with a giant telescope looking up at, you know, 30 foot telescope looking at the stars and studying, you know, he's got a phd in astronomy and I go, I think the moon's made a cheese. That's what I think that's like when people come to me until they think about big foot in or what the fuck they're talking about. Yeah. It's one of those things, man. It's a, it's one of those things where I would imagine it would get really annoying if that was your life's dedication. Like I can say I believe in big foot and people call me an idiot and I'm like, whatever.

Speaker 5:          01:29:52       I'm freely factor. I'm the fucking standup comedian, you know? There's a lot of evidence. I'm probably in it. The pig foot thing is just one little piece of the puzzle that shows your smart though. Really? I leave everything open. You know? I leave open the possibility. There's a, there's a lot of things that I leave out, but probably ridiculous, but that's, to me then that one makes sense. There's just too many people that have seen something. If one of them is true, it's real. There's too many different names for it and native American languages. I believe there's more than 105 508 categorize for North America. Yeah. What's that? There's not that many things that they believed that aren't real. You know, they have like they know, they pray to certain gods that the, you know like the rain gods and fire gods and all that kind of shit, but they don't have like things that aren't real.

Speaker 5:          01:30:45       They don't have too many like or their spirit animals and bigfoots in both worlds. Big. That's the one at walls. Some have like they think it's a real animal in both worlds, but yeah, it's, they're not dude. No native will tell you there are animal there. There are type of people. So they think it's just a tribe. A tribe. Wow. They think of it as a tribe. Oh yeah. You know what? We were just in Australia with the aboriginals. Those guys blew my mind and they have so much knowledge about these things. Like they live, they have them in Australia. How the fuck did they get to Australia? We got our folks, we'll talk about Trillia. They're not sure they were, the aboriginals all say they were there when they got their 50,000 years ago. So the big foots are good at avoiding people. On every content is not like one group of big foot's.

Speaker 5:          01:31:32       That's a retard race. They see him in the summer way North or the, uh, where it's daylight all day long. Like way in northern Canada and stuff. They'll see him like small, like outpost villages, like native villages. They'll come in because they'll go to the garbage dumps in the middle of the day and it's like, why don't you guys fill them? They just, they just don't. What, why would they just not, that doesn't make any sense in 2012 that you would see a kid's a kid. There's a lot of kids now because of our show too. Like more kids are in it and like, they're like, oh, you're like, hey, we're gonna try to film it. But these people just don't, what do you mean they just don't, that's cool. That's crazy. How could you, it's just his head. What's that? Is it crazy? Have you guys spent any time on big it is Brian.

Speaker 5:          01:32:15       No, I don't think it's crazy. What do you think they, you know, they're busy looking for this thing, hunting it. They don't carry a camera around for that. One second though. These people aren't looking for big. These people live there. Brian, are you playing devil's advocate here? What he does is killing me. I just can't believe that that that one person doesn't have, like when those go cams on and it's HD go camps that cost $89 or something like that. That has fucking crazy. If it happens, it's going to, technology is catching up to the squatch for sure. Yeah. That's going to be the drone to catch them. I Dunno dude. So do you believe that they're all over the country and you believe there are? No, I've, I've, I've personally heard them. I personally heard them and Oregon, Washington, California, Alaska, Florida, Kentucky, Florida.

Speaker 5:          01:33:03       Yeah, the skunk ape. Really. And it's not a Cuban dare you get over here. Well the, they, they have, I've started seeing a mountain lions in Florida Jam. Oh, he's just another reason like government doesn't want to acknowledge big foot is, there's a few reasons governors, Wanda, but everywhere we go, we go to these places. Like they say, there's no mountain lions here but they're here. You know, you keep hearing that until one gets hit by it or someone would get shoots. Wine. Well one got shot one recently in the Ottawa. They thought they'd been extinct in Canada or in that part of Canada for more than since the 18 hundreds those last a citing that they had and they shot a big one. Man, they're spread out. They don't want to do a shot one in Connecticut but the, you have to have a management pilot and it costs, millions of these states are all strapped yet to have a management plan.

Speaker 5:          01:33:50       They don't want to acknowledge it. That's what I said. We don't have them because they don't want to have to deal with them, but with big foot, I think it was more just what's really the biggest thing when it comes out. They're real here soon is to be the whole like I think there should be like a lot of PhD students write papers on this and like psychiatrists and psychologists are going to write books on this and on how these things, there's all this evidence and stories and just everything right there in front of you and people refuse to acknowledge it. Well, I think one of the reasons why they refuse to acknowledge is what we've talked about before. There's so many people that fake it. There's so many people that fake UFO stories. There's so many people that fake bigfoot stores. People are fucking crazy and there's a lot of people out there.

Speaker 5:          01:34:30       Big Foot storage. Well you don't think so. I think anything cryptic man, I think loch ness, anything UFO, anything big foot. I think ghosts, there's a lot of people that are full of shit when it comes to those, those stories because those are like fun stories to bring up. You know? Like if people say they saw a crocodile, a generally genuinely believed them. When you start saying you saw some shit that's, that's in the cryptic realm, man, you might've seen it, but it also might be that you're one of those crazy that likes to pretend you saw something awesome. You talk those people long enough, it comes apparent that's what's going on. See, I wish I was on your show then because I'm way better at that than most people. I'm really good at sniffing out bullshit. We're really good. We're getting ready to jump the shark here.

Speaker 5:          01:35:11       Probably pretty soon. It cause we're run out of the videos of the cat and they're talking about having celebrities. Come on dude, I'll come on. We got to come on. Oh, come on. Just let me come on in and screen your guests. Like go. This guy's gotta be, that'd be honest. This guy's full of shit. This guy's car. They'd be screaming at me like, you're not telling the truth. I know when people are telling the truth, I smell them. It's weird. I've always been good at no one crazy people. So if you bring me in front of a crazy dude and he tells you a big foot story, I'm going to tell him he's full of Shit. Well, yeah, so I mean, I don't believe everything I hear people go, you guys live. Are they gonna hear on there? It's like, well use the witnesses were dealing with, they've already been vetted.

Speaker 5:          01:35:41       One show where there was this one obviously gay guy whose nick whose job it was right here. The big files. Right? I'm like, bitch, she ain't seen no, no, no. That guy, he just tried to drag some dudes in the woods and hope somebody stumbles on your Dick. That guy was a wildlife biologist. Is he good for him? He's full of shit too. No, no, no. I totally believe it seemed like he was making it up as he went along to me. Now. He was a great dude. He was great. Yeah. Yeah. So you firmly believe that that guy saw a big foot. Yeah, we spent, we were, he was, he was his camera. This son of a bitch. We were with that guy for a week. Like, he was our local guide and he showed us around and he was, he was fun. You'd love that guy.

Speaker 5:          01:36:25       He's hilarious. But um, as he was our guide for a week, so we were with the guy for a week and Matt knew the guy for several years already. He's been on different expeditions around the country with them and he never, you know, and usually when people start telling those stories, like more will come up and it changes. His story is just the same all the way through. Sally wrote Italian, he's smart. It's good job, dude. Well, I'm not saying, I don't know. He might be the one guy that's telling the truth. Right. The one guy that we're all sure is lying. We'll see if you think he is the season. I'm sure I'll think he's lying if he think he's lying. I should. I think almost everybody's aligned. Yeah. Most people. I think if you lived out in the woods and he lived in a rural community, where there, where there are big foot's around you and you've talked to so many people that like, dude, dude, I like big foot so much.

Speaker 5:          01:37:12       I thought of getting a buying land in the Pacific northwest just to live in the summers with hope of seeing a big dude. I know, Dude. I ain't stupid. I am. I know the place is for sale right now. Really? Where is it? You sound real estate now? No, no, no, no. I bigfoot sightings spots. That'd be a good move, Dude. I'm talking to the guy about trying to buy it, right? If you went and you bought real estate, heavy big foot areas and set up a set plan, cameras and shit, that's the plan. I have a lodge. If you live like somewhere in the Pacific northwest and in an area, there's a heavy duty bigfoot sightings. She's fucking set up cameras everywhere, everywhere, and every day you go and check those cameras said, well that's, that's what the Olympic project there's going on right now. They actually, one of the, one of the best pieces, DNA from the Olympic project is this weird looking bigfoot. They've got pictures of it comes up and sniff the camera and licked it. And they got saliva off the camera. Olympic project. Yeah. Did they have these photos online? Can you see the photos of him? I think so. So where did they take the, like they shipped it next day and brought it to a site that we have. We, we uh, we,

Speaker 4:          01:38:18       there's a lot of, there's a lot of cops involved in this and we have like protocol we follow for collecting DNA evidence. Cause you guys laugh about this. I used to, I was on this crazy squatch adventure, like pride 2000 to 2001, 2002. And this thing, this guy bought property had been abandoned for 11 years and the squashes, we're living on the property and they didn't like him moving and all this stuff happened, but they, um, they, uh, they were, we'd finally these huge scats in the woods or on the property. They, China, like giant human shits, like that'd be like a foot high. And 18 inches across at the base, like big thick, like two inch cables and I'd collect them and bring them down with a fishing game and Dropbox like check out this big foot. You know, Scott, can you guys DNA test it? You know, what can you do? Blah Blah Blah. And then my buddy got a job at the fish and game like a couple of years later, I'm all do whatever happened. If I'd sat sabals he's like, we were talking about about you. I brought all these big foot scat samples and I brought in some hair a couple times and it's not, he's like, do they talk about some crazy guy

Speaker 5:          01:39:16       brings it bear shit, drops it off. They throw it away. They never even looked at it. They wouldn't even look at it. Yeah, they're probably like, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well we're going to check on it. For you. It was like that. Very unprofessional. And then you pay for something. You think that they have to give you some kind of real results. They should really be checking fuckers. Tax Dollars. Glue hair on his chest is big but episode or he's a savage. You're a very good catcher. Brian's an animal. Um, it, so the Olympic project says they have a, the researches in the Olympic mountain range in Washington state. Uh, the Olympic project is a comprehensive systematic camera trap program consisting of 50 plus cameras placed along predatory travel routes through the Olympic mountains. Our primary focus is to obtain a series of crystal clear photographs of Sasquatch in their natural environment. So, so far it says they haven't gotten anything. Is that what it says? Yeah, they have footprints. They don't have any, none others. They see everyone had to sign

Speaker 4:          01:40:15       DA's about the DNA. So that could be why that's not on there. But I s I would see the photos. You didn't like I looked at, I thought it was a sock puppet when I first looked at it, but the DNA came back with jet.

Speaker 5:          01:40:26       Yeah. This isn't saying here that they have anything. It doesn't, no. Doesn't, not on their website, dude. I'll call, I'll call the Guy Derek that bears and deers. It's cool looking. They've won all the game camp photos. There's those big contests every like 5001st place. They have one bad ass man. They've got some awesome photos. They do have a lot of great wildlife. The mountain lion stocking the duck and the duck doesn't see it. Yeah, they weren't first prize last year with that one. It's really cool, man. They show this mountain lion walking through the snow to and they a bunch of bears, including bear standing upright, which is pretty fucking cool. Bears getting really close to the trap coyotes. Elk. Wow. I mean their camera chat photos make me want to buy some land and set up camera traps. That'd be bad ass just to see different shit every day.

Speaker 5:          01:41:15       You know huge elk. Yeah, I'll do that. Yeah. A mountain lion got right up to the camera. Oh Shit. They look, they'd notice it like animals. If you look at most of the pictures, they'll be looking at the camera. At least on the second shot. They'll that infrared flash goes up. They look. Yeah, and there's been a lot of cameras through the squatters. We'll break them. They'll turn flip around backwards. I put a camera traps from are they walked into a camp when I was in and I had the camera. The camera's all hidden like in tall grass and stuff and they're all pushed down. All of them were pushed down so that the lens was facing the ground. Wow. These folks usually just check it out. Just go to the Olympic project.com just to look at the actual real animals, the bobcats and the wildlife.

Speaker 5:          01:41:59       No fucking big foot though. They got, they got a fee. They got a photo of elk. Fucking awesome elks. Paused right in front of the camera and fuck. This is amazing. Can you put it back up on that one? I can see. Yeah, put up an Olympic project. This is a myth. The, the photos are amazing man, but no big foot man. They've got another camera. There's a two shot. There's two shots of, uh, of a squatch coming up to the camera real close. But it must not be on the way. You don't. I'll call Derrick when we're done. And this one, it says bear gets close to the camera. They don't, I don't see shit up here. That's a, that says that even says it's too big foot. I don't think it's up there just because of the NDA. Look, there it is. That's it.

Speaker 5:          01:42:42       Yeah. Scroll down to photos are awesome man. It's really cool that they're saying that Sasquatch right there. What? That mountain lion looking fat down. The next one down. That's the squatch. Oh wait, where's the one where you can see it's whole arm and eyeball and stuff. The creature reappears so it go back up there. That one? Yeah. Okay. They've done all this analization on that and that hair pattern, the and patterns of that and the tha tha tha that's like seven that things like seven feet off the ground. So it can be a bear. Bears don't get over six, six, six would be the top like a trophy bear kind of bear black bears. There's only black only black pants, like a producer guy. Uh, six six is like about as big as a blackberry. Good. Six foot, huge for black pair. Brian, which uh, which page did you look@andthebigproject.com possible squat sightings possible squatch side.

Speaker 5:          01:43:35       Is it on the menu? But did you guys patent the word squatch cause I had never heard it. Is that you? Did you come up with it? Um, I know Scott Harris. You never know that guy. A comedian he has got, what's his name? Harriet? No, he wasn't like big timer thing. But I know he did a documentary called squatch in, but I never heard anyone say it before. I've said it was rainy. Licky man, this is a what? I was the first one. Shit. Yeah. Well can't see shit. I agree. I've not too impressed when they sons of bitches but do that. But again, animal experts have looked at it and the hair does it match and then how could you tell me you can't tell him like an animal, etc. A PETCO and this is the problem. The problem is the best fuck that their best shit is blurry as fuck because it's set there.

Speaker 5:          01:44:24       The camera's set to take pictures like 30 feet away. Not a foot, but they're pro their photo galleries. Amazing man. Yeah. I don't care if it's set to take 33 this is, it should be a photo of man. It should be a photo wanting to fuck up thing. One comment. I hope so man. Frustrated dude. It's really fresh. What if they found out that it wasn't real? What did you find out? You already stooped. See that there's no way you got duped. There's no, I'm not worried about that. So what you saw was so conclusive that you're 100% sure. Why didn't you have a camera? One of those 12 times? I did do, but it was the only one I saw on that day that I didn't cause my, my shit got ripped off. Like when synclavier and you leave your truck that will not put psychically knew that your camera wasn't present.

Speaker 5:          01:45:04       Imagine if there is so sensitive. I would have had a camera when I got a picture. Do you think so? I wouldn't have. It was, it was less. I slept for like literally like half a second. It was just gone. Once Google goggles comes out, people need to go hiking for Sasquatch. People aren't goggle cause there's people wearing those now that those the a little GoPros. Yeah, we'll not have a smaller ones. We were like little spy ones but does one suck the rate resolution set to the goat razor HD. So it's like people are using coke brothers. People are mountain among the helmets they have to someone. This is, it's going to get ridiculous. So there's a new, there's a new footage. We take it as real of a squashed down on the side of the road that some hillbillies. God with a Gopro.

Speaker 5:          01:45:39       Really? Yeah. The new footage maybe if you look up from like two or three weeks ago it sat on the side of the road. It's on the right. It's up in Canada somewhere. New Big foot footage. What would you look up on? Youtube. Canadian. Bigfoot. Maybe go pro. A lot of sightings come from Katie. Can I Canadia and like crazy. It was just crazy. People reporting them. There'd be just as many settings in Hawaii. Right? Right. Or road. I will not really, because if there wasn't a place for them in 1900 or 1850, everyone knew what a Unicorn was and no one knew what a big foot was. But you can find hundreds and hundreds of newspaper clippings about people seeing a giant ape. There's no people saying they saw a unicorn. Right? Yeah, yeah. It's always the same thing. Right? Yeah. And it follows the same pattern is like we were when we were in Australia, like we, we'd always heard that you always were different than um, that's what they call me. The aboriginals and the struck home galleys, we'd always heard galleys were different than big foot's. When we're down there, we found out there tear Bigfoot's man. I mean that the way they act, we hurt the best stuff or recorded was in Australia you think the exactly the same. I don't know about that, but the, the,

Speaker 4:          01:46:50       the action, the patterns, all that was the same. Did you have photos or are of anything that you got in Australia? Like what is all the aggregators are saying? No, they don't. The behavioral patterns and and what people describes, there's a little like, you know, maybe the difference between like a, like a European gray wolf in a North American grill. You know what I mean? Like same genus and all that. But yeah, there's a lot of photos of wolves. Yeah. But they didn't, they didn't do that. The biggest, the biggest, they did a three year study on wolverines. Almost wolverine you see on shows aren't wildlife parks. They're there. They've been like babies that were captured when her mother got killed or whatever. But they did a three year study, millions of dollars spent on this and the only footage they got was from like four to 500 yards away on a snowfield of a wolverine going away.

Speaker 4:          01:47:38       And that was a well-equipped, professionally funded looking for a known animal and they got one clip in three years. That's pretty crazy. Yeah. It's like snow leopards. They didn't get any footage of snow leopards until like 2007 do you think that people just underestimate the amount of actual forest? God, yeah. You don't need a million acres of forest for a squash to hide. But you think you would because otherwise people would run into it. People run into them all the time. They're seeing all, it's just not that you guys expected me ever waver. I need a fucking photo. Just one. Just one. And you don't find any of this? I then I've been with squatters and stuff that had said like, yeah, I had my camera around my neck or I was holding it and I saw it and it looked at me and they just shit their pants and froze and even after the thing was gone, I didn't even think of to take a picture of toe was gone.

Speaker 4:          01:48:27       Yeah. I'm looking at this, a Canadian, the new Canadian big foot footage. Is it? The one on the side of the road is down on the side, stand down like below the below. He's like walking through a trail. None of those things just, it's just a car drives by, it's down on the side of the road standing there. Oh really? No. This one's different. This one's a dude walking through the world. When I say hillbilly, I don't mean any negative connotation of that. Like to me it's like a, you know, compliment a hillbilly as a compliment. I do like I say redneck and Hillbilly, I don't mean anything bad by it at all. Well, a lot of rednecks to like being rednecks and hillbillies don't like being called the hillbillies, you know? No, I found that out the hard way. Well this, well they tried to fight.

Speaker 4:          01:49:06       You does get mad at him? Yeah, they'd get offended. Like one of the witnesses has got really mad that I, you know, I was just joking around like mad some hillbilly shit there, you know, ball and he got real offended and it was like, well, he's probably crazy. That's why he's making a big foot story and getting offended here. You son of a bitch is the original original video is over an hour long. So what were they doing? They were driving around. Yeah. This one. It's real quick. It's either, uh, either it's a dude t they're racist video. Where's this thing down? The right, right, right there. Highlight it. Wow. What

Speaker 1:          01:49:55       my not saying that you don't see where it's to the shadow starts. It's right in front of the first shot

Speaker 8:          01:50:00       right there. See

Speaker 4:          01:50:02       really if you go one more couple more frames, it's really clear

Speaker 8:          01:50:10       right there.

Speaker 1:          01:50:12       But that photo they just showed oddly enough with like a million times better has it loose and vague as fuck. That was that. So good. Then this

Speaker 1:          01:50:25       which is on. Oh that is kind of weird. But it seems me to go investigate it. It seems like a trick of lighting and shadows to me. Really? Yeah. Cause it seems like it's moot ball. Maybe it's just because of the resolution of the video. It could be. We're going to go check it out on the side right there. Right. That's the clearest. Well there's of their own video. They went back later and filmed it and it's not there or it's not there. So it's either a man in a suit or a squash. I see.

Speaker 8:          01:50:53       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:50:53       And then these guys, these, this video, this would have been right here. Yeah. That's so clear. And I mean this is the same, same footage

Speaker 8:          01:51:03       there, you know.

Speaker 1:          01:51:06       Listen man, that's some shadows I can kid money. Don't go on that trip. We got to go look at something. How many sightings do you guys get? Like a month that uh, that they asked you to investigate?

Speaker 4:          01:51:19       Oh, well there's like the shit, I'm not going to wade through all this shit. Like look at every video. Like they have a whole production team that just all I did was scour the Internet. Look for everyday there's a new video. Put up your worry now that the show's a hit that people might still faking it. Oh totally. We already are. We're getting that. He must be right. I mean we're pretty good. I mean we've been doing this be clip metal. All they do, there's like 20 years. We're pretty good at filtering people out pretty quick. Like we caught one guy hugs and in the Ohio Epa side really wasn't. Yeah, Brian's from so blame him. They don't and they don't want us to see a lot of stuff ahead of time if they want us to be surprised when we see it. We all know it just cause we're in the big community. But you know, I didn't see that video before and I'm looking at it on a monitor this big. And then when you see it on home, like on a big high def TV and everyone, you are fooled by that video at the beginning. You know, it's like, well, I just saw it on a black and white monitor, like, you know, five inch monitor or something. But it was a guy, you know, cliff busted him clips straight up, called the guy a liar, right? Dan? The guy started like trembling and tearing up and stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:52:21       So he's a faker in a bitch. How dare you sir, with your fake big foot footage. Listen man, I really want to believe. I really do. And uh, I might be a little bit more skeptical than you, but I hold out hope. I really believe in. It's no, it, I wish I, I wish I shared you enthusiasm. It'd be fun. I'd be out there with you. I'm very enthusiastic. I hope it's real. I just feel like there's a lot of fucking lot

Speaker 4:          01:52:46       of fuckery afoot, but so I feel like, yeah, but it's, but if any of it's real, it's real. Well if one of them is a real then it's ready. Right. So you're, yeah, so it is real well if you seen it. Yeah. You, what you've seen is on fuckery. You, you know more than anybody, which is probably why I'm saying you know, is more than the average person for sure. And even more than the average person researching it because you've seen it. Right. How many researchers haven't seen anything? Does it, has the chicken, the show ever seen anything? She seems to be the most skeptical. What's her name? Renee. Renee. She saw something in the Olympic peninsula when she were, the Olympic project is where I just got back this weekend. She saw something, she doesn't say what it was. She said it, it looked like it was tall and it was, and there was like a arm, like an arm and she, she's like, what could have been a bear walking upright?

Speaker 4:          01:53:38       Or it could have been a bear that was just starting to drop down as it was running, like picking up speed on two legs, getting ready to drop down and, and but it, she probably saw squatch she's the most skeptical out of the group. Would you agree with that? That's her job too. I mean there's been times where she was like, Holy Shit though as a squash. And they're like, you can't say that. You know, like oh they tell her she can't say nothing. We're in Oregon when we recorded those ones, 2000 I think it's like, did they do that? They, they'd tell you what you, you're supposed to, what role you're supposed to play in the show and she plays the skeptic role. Yeah, we'll just, when we were in Oregon, she was like, when it happened she was like, oh my God, that had like, that had to be a squash.

Speaker 4:          01:54:13       I had to be a squash. We're like, look, you can't see why they say she can't say that. Cause then I guess like, you know, then she wouldn't be taking [inaudible]. I'm probably gonna get totally in trouble for having said that. Probably. Yeah. Well they don't, well they say they never been a part of her cause she, she represents all the people at home that are skeptical. That's her job is to represent them. Like what would they say? Like the person that thinks it's all bullshit, what would they, she's supposed to ask the question that that person did she, when, when she was seeing something, what did she see that made her so convinced she didn't see? She heard her. What'd she here do? We heard two squatters call them back and forth. I've been Malala river in Oregon and it's, it's on the episode, but dude, it was, if you've heard of Murphy's law, Murphy's laws and nothing, squatters laws, way worse.

Speaker 4:          01:54:59       Like what squashes law. If something's gonna go wrong, right? When that happens, it will, like your battery dies or whatever. Like just whatever it may be happens, right? When we've got a call from the network one, camera B, whatever isn't working, there's no, all the tape you sent us is blank. And we get this call. We're out in the woods and it was like when it finally came through, somebody would come back from camp, like the messages come in earlier that day and they're like, you got to check the camera right now and check the audio. Like there's nothing sync that and it just turned out to, the editor was totally blowing it but we stopped all filming. He was putting the camera back into playback mode to see what he had the song. I was checking his stuff. I had a pair of boxers, it wasn't part of their stuff.

Speaker 4:          01:55:38       I had a parabolic to record and it was going from like would clear up and get really cold and like kind of clawed back up and then get a little bit warmer. So I had like five layers. I was taken off the lyrics, I was burning up and I had the parabolic that were in pitch black. I put the paralogue in the brush and these things started screaming and I got my job. I like my whatever, my thermal, I'm pulling off over my head right when this happens and we're, everyone's like holy shit. Like, you know, when it first happened were like no way. And then by the time we got up and then the salads from between me and the camera guy was like, the whole crew is between me shy of the parabolic dish here. And all it picked up was just these guys, you know, ripping up and Velcro, like uncovering stuff.

Speaker 4:          01:56:16       And because it had been raining on and off, guys going no way talk. And so you can't hear any, nothing comes to a parabolic. I mean it's that fuel the, and then we hear stuff at homes, this is what I want them to put more effort into this as capturing what we hear. Like we were the mics that are made to block out all sound except for us talking. Right, exactly. And they don't pick up screams in the distance. They're designed not to. So, but we do have a guy that's going out of this now that has the parabolic and he's, you know, but you have to be pointed, like if it's coming from right there and you're appointed here, you might not get it right. Like you gotta be pointed right at it and we don't have the best gear for that. He's like, it's kind of Hokey.

Speaker 4:          01:56:53       Do you know like when you hear something in the woods too, it's kind of weird. Things echo off of trees and stuff. It's hard to pinpoint exactly where it's coming from. I totally like my ear. Um, like I was, you know, big time and a servant for a long time. Oh you got that soul surfer. Yeah. So I have one grows and your, yeah, and it's worse than my left ear and a fix that with surgery. Yeah they can, I got to get it done. But my hearings really good though. It's like, but it's, my ear will cause the cavities so small can clog up easy. So sometimes it's clogged and whatever's like, they shouldn't always show going. Is that a squash or something like that? And they never show like where we go. Like, you know, after we hear the Giggling, oh that was a coyote or that was a bear or whatever.

Speaker 4:          01:57:34       It was edited Hokey. They tried to make it a little bit about season one. They did. I thought season two, they did a good job. And, um, season three we'll see how they do that. I mean, season two, the editors did a great job. I'll show. Got Way better. How many seasons have you done so far? This one re we shot through, they've shown two seasons. We just finished the third, like 10 more episodes. We just got picked up for seasons four and five. We start next month. So they're going to start Erin season three in the fall. We'll already be puppet in episodes for four. And so they're going to air like seven and a half months straight every Sunday in new episode. So that's awesome. So when you go out there or how, how many, like if you take a hundred trips, how many trips do you hear something or see some footprint or something?

Speaker 4:          01:58:18       Um, uh, it seems to go in waves. Like, I mean, I haven't seen a squash since 2007 so I haven't seen anything for five years being out there a lot. And that's gotta be frustrating. Yeah. But from 2000 well is there, which I never, I never, I don't tell this story. I don't count it because it was just so frustrating. But my buddy and bart, we got flooded. We note were, we know we got some but it was such an old school kind of shitty thermal. It's just this big blurry heat things you can't, you can't prove any of that. We know like all the sounds are with it. What happened? It was a squatch. I was walking back out of the same place that it was big rainstorm and cliff. They got in a show at me. The other guy cliff, he had this guy, Walter, he invented the ACDC adapter is, it's like billionaire guy that was funding us finance equipment and clip it just fried as recording unit, like a $1,500 a unit in the rain.

Speaker 4:          01:59:13       And while I told us like, hey, you guys can't be keep blowing cause he grew up poor even though he's like a billionaire guy, he's still, he grew up, you know he's frugal guy like hey you guys can't be frying stuff out in the rain if it's raining, just put the stuff away, you know. So I was walking back out and end up run the thermal, it has a waterproof flat, you have to open that stick in a cord that goes to a recording yet cause it does. Now we have built recorders with thermal but then we did it and I was walking back out and I got back down where we'd seen it three weeks before and it hadn't been a peep on that. And usually all the action happens way back up where I was coming from and I had walked a few miles, my truck was parked right out the hop right off the highway next to some houses and the thing ran, it was just standing behind my truck.

Speaker 4:          01:59:57       And if I had filmed it it would be clear cut. Like, no, it was way taller than the back of my truck. I have a shell, it's about this high and it was above the shell. So when I filmed it, why didn't feel it? I looked at it right when I pulled my, thrown them out of my pocket. I'm looking at it and there's water, big Robert Water drops coming down. It like went blurry really quick, what I was looking at. But you could see it for a second and it just ran up the driveway. And I'd never tell that story cause everyone's like, you had a recording in it and you didn't record it. Like, you know, Blah Blah Blah. That's gotta be frustrating as fuck dude did it. That was like, did you ever get tired of people saying that you're crazy? No, it says that no one, when you talked to regular folks, just like firmly embedded it.

Speaker 4:          02:00:41       I don't give a shit. I know I'm right. I know I'm right. I don't care what they say. I know. To me it's like people going, you're crazy that you know that the sun goes around the earth. So for you it's just a matter of time. It's just I know it's coming out. I know it's going to come out like all this stuff going on. There's no way. And I mean people are talking about how there's not better footage and we'll look who's trying to get the footage. It's guys like me, you know like Sony and camcorders and it's not professional. It's hard to get equipment back to where these things are. If you really talking about deep with berries, like all that kind of stuff, like generators, how long do you stay out there when you do like a camp? When you go squatch and like me and cliff did a two month or one time to ma. Not Deep, but we'd come back and supply up. I was like, that was the longest we went straight months. So what you would go back like how often to civilization to get supplies whenever we wanted like it at least once a week. You were just camping out there for two months? Yeah. Yeah. Jesus Christ

Speaker 5:          02:01:40       and then home home for like a couple of weeks ago I went fishing. Did you get paid some money when you were out there for two months? Filmed it? Nothing. No. Cliff took a year, something cliff lived in Long Beach as a school teacher and I was like, dude, you know, all his TV companies have been call me, but they're going to, we're going to get a Shugg on. Just quit your job, come up, we'll go squatch and just quit your job slayer house. We'll go squatch them for a year. And yet he did. Wow. And we were out for like, Brian was ready to do that right now. At least felt like seven months ago. We did about seven months of that year out in the woods, seven months out thermals and we'd drive at night. You know, we'd drive these roads. Real slug. We had it pretty wild, like to get good like, and uh, we thought it was going to be game over because I'd hurt him so many times around me.

Speaker 5:          02:02:22       Comfort and growl and snap branches and stomp their feet walking around on two feet and stuff like that that I just thought with a thermal, it's going to be, give us a week, we'll have footage two weeks max and I have it and it's not the case at all. Like they, they, I think they've been shot at so many times that even when it's pitch black, they still are always taking that evasive action they can see in the dark. Oh yeah. I know they can. They can definitely see in the dark for nocturnal creatures. For the most part, they're there. They'll come on the day to like, like, you know, never seen their eyes up close to it. Right. When I see something I seen other I the one I saw the daylight, the eye, it was this, the way the sun was coming down, it's, I was so deep set, it's brown was out so far.

Speaker 5:          02:03:04       I couldn't see that. I remember that was one thing that struck me because it was that quick. But the one thing I remember really clearly was the hair was real shiny. It was super skinny. It was the arm was, it's going to say this one was, all the ones I've seen at night were bulky except where I saw one about your size. Like a lot of it was about five 10 look like, like a high school linebacker or something like five, 10 to 20 something like that. So it was an adolescence. I try. Yeah. Yeah. And uh, but these are the big ones I saw were all bull like bulky and you know, these are all through night vision or thermal from far away and a lot of fucking food. They would think it would do a lot of damage and leave shit everywhere. Well they've been seen shit in like flowing water and in late like there are conscious about hiding their scat.

Speaker 5:          02:03:49       Like they really, they just don't shit in the trail. So you think they're like smart enough to know that people are a threat? Actively avoid people who they are kind of people there are kind of people. Well, I mean that foot's a footprint of a fucking human. No, no. If there's, there's no model. Do you know what I mean? It's built the big toe down hall, Middle Toe. I mean, not a gorilla for sure. It looks like a giant human footprint. Superficially. It looks like a human. Well, there's nothing else like that in the primary world. It hasn't felt like that us and well, that's another interesting thing that came to light recently. Um, uh, scientifically over the last decade, they found that, I think they call them homo floresiensis from orient wait at Flory ansys. Is that it? Oh God, Chris going to kill me. He's always taught me how to say it, right. Because I've always said it wrong because when I read it, I'd say it in my head. Yeah. Rock Larissa Ansys.

Speaker 1:          02:04:39       Okay. Well what it is folks that it's really like a Hobbit, like a real hobbit that really did exist and may even eight, eight people, they might, there's a lot of evidence that they're still there. Really? Yeah. Well this, this thing, they found bones recently within the last decade and um, but really fascinating stuff. The absolutely know that a very small type of human being existed and it was really like a, it's not like a dwarf or like a mutation or a, you know, a genetic screw up or anything like that. It's a whole species, a different completely different species of human being that, um, they call it the florists man or two. It's, they called it like a modern day hobbit and it's, it's amazing. I mean this is something that was mythological up until just a few years ago and now fact scientific fact, they know for sure this existed. This is a real small animal. And where do they think this thing's still lives?

Speaker 4:          02:05:35       Um, well maybe the Cape York peninsula of Australia, like the Stranger Torres through their lecture in Australia and going up in an age of, there's reports of them on islands up in there to this day. And then in the 80s I'm a really respected, he was a missionary to the aboriginals up in the kit. You know, that Cape York peninsula goes up in, I'll start that big point. It goes up. There's only like one road that goes around it. There, it's just empty. And he was up there like visiting his rural remote villages and he got a pack of them came up on him and what he described that he had a forensic artist draw what he saw back then. It, it matches exactly what the reconstructions are from the remains they found in Flores island. Why the Flores man? Like it's uh, um, how many do you think live up there?

Speaker 4:          02:06:18       They don't know and they don't even know that there's, like the aboriginal said they haven't seen him. They said they're still around, but they haven't seen him in a while. Well they say they, they haven't seen him. We didn't talk to him and see them within 10 years, but they're supposedly up and those islands up in there still. And then there's another type of big foot up in those. Um, we've talked to this guy, he's on Australia Bro. He's like their version of like a like public radio down in Australia, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. He's the naturalists for them. Like he identifies calls this and that. He's a phd. He saw one, and I'm Papa New Guinea, yet like 9,000 feet doing a bird survey for the UN back in the 70s. I mean, so that they're seeing their, their seating islands too, which is pretty trippy and well in 2004 B, if you ask any anthropologist how many, how many, how many hominids like us, you know, like homo branch, like Homo Erectus was alive 30,000 years ago. The answer would have been to Neanderthal homosapien and now it's for you notice that the hobbits and then that they found that new kind of Niana like when they call it [inaudible] or uh, the one up in Russia they found two years ago and they got the DNA chai knuckle boom, the knuckle bones, like twice as big as a human. And they got DNA out of that. So now there's four hominid species that are known and one squatch comes out. And

Speaker 5:          02:07:36       what with the, from talking to people that I know that we're part of the DNA study is that, that it's not a tree, it's not the homo homosapiens like how humans came. The Homo branch isn't a tree. It's a very bushy plant. It's, it's, it's a lot of lateral, a lot of crossing. And uh, what the DNA shows is that there's five types of homage species in, in I'm in us, there wasn't these clean breaks coming down through like most people are part neanderthal. Most white bull spread. Everyone that's not like your audience. Let's say that one MMA fighter is our Lawsky. Maybe it's 10% what's really, yeah, there's some, where'd you hear that? Um,

Speaker 8:          02:08:22       yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:08:22       God, I was I talking to you. It was some of those, part of that genetic say, but they've, they've got, they've got people with 12 think I would have heard that there was 12% DNA, 12% in the top 12%. Deana told DNA and people that can in a, you like that area of above Mongolia Far East Russia. Really? Yeah. They've found and we're, you're, if you're, if you're European, you're at least 2% like you have at least 2% nan or tall. Did you, uh, have you seen that footage that's been going around the Internet recently? We talked about it on yesterday's podcast, the atoll and versatile space, like the one picture where it's sitting there on a rock looking over. No, the aunt and neanderthal that looks like a gorilla besides the guy's idea that they weren't, they didn't look like us. They at black skin like gorilla and they were really scary and muscular and they fed on people and they were like a, a super predator. He's already got that. That there has been refuted. Yeah. Yeah. But it's fascinating. There's a picture, there's a picture of a, um, possible Dan or tall just taking like last week that's up on the Internet. Have you seen that? No. Well, Doctor Melbourne, like he's impressed with it. He doesn't authenticate it, but he, they think there might still be neanderthals. Oh yeah. You haven't heard that? No. Oh Dude. Who thinks it might be neanderthal? A lot of scientists over in, in Russia for one thing.

Speaker 8:          02:09:37       Okay.

Speaker 5:          02:09:38       I don't see anything about his DNA and China's, um, uh, there, there are launching, um, well they, they have urine over in China. We're probably gonna go, we're there. We're probably going to go to Russia and China. Look, check that stuff out on the show.

Speaker 8:          02:09:51       Okay.

Speaker 5:          02:09:52       Well in China they have a, an animal, they set aside a whole national park forum recently. What? Yeah, urine Y, r e. N. And what is this thing? Supposedly like a Yeti. Yeti. So, uh, it's in the Himalayas. Tibet. They, this range out. Then I remember like that there's some of the best photos were, uh, from the Himalaya, so of footprints and shipping photo. And there was a scalp dude, I can, I know that whole story inside and out. Yeah. Whatever happened when that scalp that they'd found, did they ever figured out what that thing is? Well,

Speaker 8:          02:10:26       okay.

Speaker 5:          02:10:27       For the monks, uh, Peter Burns stole some of this stuff. He's still alive up in Oregon. He's about 85, six. He was an

Speaker 4:          02:10:34       event. He was on those original expeditions in the 50s. He's still involved in big foot research, but, um, there's two different, there's two stores and I'm not sure how they crossed, but they would, they replace the stuff that was out that people could look at with, with goat skins and just sewed it like the Yeti. But they actually kept the Yeti, the Yeti scalp and like a sacred box. And the other story is that, um, you knew who was a big part of this was uh, Jimmy, um, God, you know, uh, Mr. Smith goes to Washington. Jimmy Stewart.

Speaker 5:          02:11:08       Oh really? He's looking for Sasquatch high. Well, they're looking at, he was a hue acts snitch by the way. He was a what you accidentally does that House on an American affairs committee though when they blackballed all the people in Hollywood penis. Yeah, he was, he was the guy that ratted out all the guys anyways. Well what a Dick. He was a full on, I'm like anti evolutionary, like uh, really creationist Ah, cause I'm on the air on the throne and he uh, and it's gone. There's a big four, there's a, there's a book coming out about detailing how he was buying these remains that it would come out of Asia. Like he bought like a checkout on pivot, get stuff. He bought other stuff and he'd have it destroyed. What Jimmy Stewart did that part of the theory. Minnesota, Minnesota ice man, you know the Minnesota iceman, that blonde eyes. Oh yeah, yeah. The guy. I'm like that's what they called them. The name.

Speaker 4:          02:12:03       Um, well Minnesota ice man is the most common look. Hey, punch that up cause you punch that up. Minnesota ice man. There's a lot. Like they didn't, that was uh, uh, uh, well the stories either got shot in Vietnam or in Russia got shot above the eye and this guy is writing a book. I know the guy threatened the book. He's, you know, professor guy and supposedly there's a lot of Jimmy Stewart

Speaker 5:          02:12:25       bought that and had it destroyed. Why? Yeah, that's I'm thinking of the wrong thing. I'm thinking of the uh, wasn't Minnesota thinking of the guy they found the glacier, the ancient oh yeah, that guy. Yeah. He was a straight person. This is Minnesota ice man. It's all the arm over its head is frozen in a block of ice and they showed it all over and then since it's a hoax, so probably what does that usually when they say who said it's a hoax? A Wikipedia? Yeah, it was a hoax. Wow. It's just saying it's a hoax. All they're saying it's a hoax. Period. History.

Speaker 4:          02:13:03       What does that look up? Look up the photos. Vernal's Huberman who was like one of the top anthropologists in the world study that thing pretty close. And he staked his whole rotation and it was real. And what did he say? It was thought it was at neanderthal that had been shot like a recently shot man or tall. That's it right there. That's the face. Yeah, because the power went out one time and it started the, the uh, I started melting that it was in and they said a distinct rotten meat odor smell was coming out like rotten flesh. Now what do they think if they think that Nina, there are also real, just went away from it. There's the body.

Speaker 8:          02:13:43       It's, um,

Speaker 5:          02:13:45       those are your five year old drew it. Yeah. Is that it was wrong. Yeah. That's a, that's a totally a drawing cause like look at it.

Speaker 4:          02:13:50       Yeah, but that's what, that's just showing you what it looks like. Have like exaggerated sized hands and her feet.

Speaker 8:          02:14:00       Hmm.

Speaker 4:          02:14:02       Where's your photos or photos? Foot. I don't know where the, yeah, there's photos. There's like video of it and everything. I mean, I don't know where that is. All that. And Jimmy Stewart had that destroyed [inaudible] I don't, I mean that's just this guy. That's what people he's talking to. That's what he's heard.

Speaker 5:          02:14:17       Well, if we learned anything on this show, it's fuck Jimmy Stewart. I think we learned that. He usually, I just strongly believe in Jesus and don't believe in big foot. I Dunno man. He thought it would shake people's faith in God if evolution was proven true. What a silly bitch or Joe Fox Magic Joe. Well, you know, how does that shake your belief in God? It's even if the Bible was 100% bullshit, it shouldn't shake your belief. It's possible that there could be a god, but it's also possible that people are full of shit. And that story sucks. Right? It's, that's like simple mathematics. Right? And that if we apply to big foot means that there's a certain percentage of those big foot stories that are bullshit. But I hope, I hope to real. I hope. I hope there's a percentage that are real and that may be soon we get something. Give me something. A fucking photo. A dead one. What about the DNA if it comes out there? It's true. Yeah. I mean, what if it's pure review? Study proves, right. Bruce inclusive. That's the thing that's driving me crazy. It's like it's it be out by now or at least you know, it's, it doesn't take that long to tell you what it is.

Speaker 4:          02:15:27       It is when it's a new species and there's no type specimen. If they had a type specimen, it'd be easy. But when you have a type specimen for deer berets, right? Real quick. So when there's no type specimen takes a long time to do the name. And when there's all kinds of markers showing homo sapiens and people, would people have these misperception what DNA and how DNA works due to those TV shows? CSI and shit. Yeah, I mean that stuffs, if you're talking about a cryptid species that is, has nothing to do. I mean those guys will, you got 3 billion genomes and your DNA strand and when they go to court they just have to line up like seven, seven of those like certain markers to get a conviction. Right. So I mean it's like wow, it's when you're talking about 3 billion and there was, there had been all thought there was like 30 if you watch those shows, it looks like there's like, well they, they didn't mind it was going to say want.

Speaker 4:          02:16:14       It's like 30 of them. Oh, right, right. Oh, that's what it looks like. But they don't line up all 3 billion. I think when you've got a certain sections and line up those sections. And what happened was with that, with the guy, that sample, he brought in the shooter there, there's like, so there'd be strands like with like 2.9 billion in there, but the gap right here in a gap right here, but you could line up other DNA samples and those gaps would fill in. They'd all line up, none of them are complete. Then he brought on the first complete one. So now they just have to go to the peer review process and other people have to find the same conclusions that this woman is. What is the criticism about this woman? Again, he never really got to that. I've never met her in person.

Speaker 4:          02:16:53       I don't want to bat an eye people that I really respect and know that our smart people, professionals are working with her and really liked her. And I've talked to other people that are like, dude, she shady. Uh, so, so who knows, right? I don't know. I don't know her personally. Now when does a, the show, uh, when does a season two or season three reason twos over season three? They just said sometime in the fall products sweeps week or something. They're gonna cause you're still Aaron episodes. I was still like show him and repeats, I don't know. Popular show. Yeah it's real. Well right cause they, it's like the second most popular and animal planet history didn't say didn't uh South Park parody guys. Yeah fuckers. Fuck cause we were all laughing like wait we all love South Park and the producers that we're going to show like comedian stand up comedians and stuff and like they love this show and here's money maker and a box.

Speaker 4:          02:17:45       So we thought well we thought it was going to be was because we saw that we saw some little clip that came out way earlier. Someone got ahold of somehow of a, it showed them like dressed up like ass, like wearing backpacks and stuff and we thought for sure they going to have carbon played moneymaker cause he's like carbon and make her like the same guy and that's pretty good. So then they made Clinton and Matt like normal and then they made me this fucking short retard that is all scared. Like it was the most, like they didn't get it. I like this little short, retarded is scared. Like I can't talk. They don't talk all that great, but so they got you the worst. Oh Dude. I'm only guy. They slaughtered video. Have you seen the episode? I haven't seen it. Brian told me it's awesome. It's a find a clip of it. I get, I get Cartman. Hi Dude. We talked about the show on the podcast so many times that people will yell at, uh, during comedy shows. Have you gone squatch in yet? Oh really? Yeah. People you don't want it to, it's very squashed

Speaker 1:          02:18:49       area. Have you seen the memes of, you were like, it was like a meme is like an internet photo that live, they add a lel words too, and then it gets passed on so many times. You know, like a meme would be, there's a photo of you or like, here's a perfect example. You know, George, Josue glows from ancient aliens. There's a photo of him. It says, I'm not saying it was aliens, but it was aliens. It's like, it's always one of those type things. There's only one answer aliens and it'd be the same photo, but like with different texts. But there's awesome ones of you where it's like, that's a tree. This seems squashy

Speaker 5:          02:19:29       thank you. See if you can find them. Brian there in the, the Rogan board thread for this. We were, I was thought squats. Pull one up if you can. I would say squat. She laughed, but I started saying it even more when I found out it was a drinking game on college campuses because watch are shown or told me to say squash or squash or they drink. It's like, I ain't going to kill somebody. That's it. Like four times it, it's like you can tell this places squatch it. You look around the squatch with k through here and squashed over there and like, ah, just to try to give them alcohol poisoning. Yeah. It was a drinking game for the UFC. If someone got rocked, I said he's rocked and people that drink, there's a bunch of other things too. So if you play along at home, Oh, I'm looking at this photo, this monkey, this fake thing.

Speaker 5:          02:20:09       It looks fake as fuck. Dude, man, my aunt, my cousin Donnie says he knows he's the little, uh, Italian guy with a thick Boston accent that worked with a Subaru dealer in Santa Monica. Do you remember him? A Subaru dealer in Santa Monica. Did I look at a car there or something? And he's salt. Never called me a Subaru, so I don't know. He said he knew or maybe it was from the playbook. You ever go to the playboy mansion once? I hosted the marijuana policy project thing there. So I was there once there was a marijuana policy project, had a thing at the mansion. It was a, it's like they rented out, you know, so it's like, everybody's like, wow. Oh right. And they like, they hired a couple chicks to go around with like strippers that aren't even playbase, right? Fucking, yeah, it's a sausage factory. It's all done. It's right. Whereas the girls, people, I know, he's been up there finding the memes. Take us out. This is how they portrayed the big bigfoot field. Researchers are going to see,

Speaker 9:          02:21:08       would you stop scaring everyone with your gun? People Thought Atlantis was a myth. Cow. But I was just there. I explored the depth of Atlanta is, and now that to prove a new species exist on a little James Cameron, they see black going to prove anything. To believe any of this, you either have to be a liar or stupid. These are professional people who go around tracking. SASQUATCH is cow. They aren't liars and they aren't stupid. Look at its trajectory and head directly to the right. Can't be human. It's too low to the ground. What do you think Bobo? Bobo think scary. I think in a Sasquatch it's not big enough to be a squatch, so it's a baby. Squatch that's what I'm thinking. I've already done my research boys. What you're looking at there is a Juba Cobra jump on camera. It's like a Sasquatch, only more elusive, more ferocious, and a little more greening. Oh, Jupa carbon. That's scary. If we rule out a human and a baby, Sasquatch, Juba. Copper is all we really have left the man. I guess that's it. You're going to have to allow only me and to the Easter egg hunts there. I'm the only one credit fed

Speaker 5:          02:22:09       that one. That must be. That must be awesome to have that. I mean that to me as a South Park Fan, I would, I would faint and they fucking parody dear show. Fucking retard. Really. You though. It's just a character real. You has the big foot community quite well today. Thanks very much for the and squash and hat. This is pretty fucking dope. If they did me, I would be a gay cat. That's probably right stage that you think is the good part though. Cause I got Cartman. Hi, you've got Carmen. I turned carbon into a Jew. Really? Yeah. Wow. I'll check out the rest of it. Go on South Park Studios. They had all the episodes and the episode is call it Jeeva, cholera or whatever. Do you pack a, I'll just spell it out. J. E. W. P. A. C. C. A. B. R. A. It's seasoned 16 Jupa. Cobre. Yeah, like a trooper cover, but a Jew. That's what I was thinking it was God blessed South Park, the best man. They're there, but no one's consistently put out funny shit. Why they heckled fuck the heroin like, well dude, look at your, your fucking on a bigfoot show. Money makers for all of them. They all looked retarded. That's what South Park does. They went after you a little harder, but come on man.

Speaker 5:          02:23:30       It's an honor and you're on a big food show, man. That's really how they respect that. Dot. They'd fucked up when big foot, when you get something solid men, then the tide will change. You're going to come in, they're going to have a fucking float for you in downtown La Cause it'd be a big parade every right. We found a real big foot and you and moneymaker and the, and they could put all this stuff back in the Renee saying, I think it's squatch because then we'll know. Now we know squashes. It isn't always that she did that when we were in Oregon. They should have left that shit in authenticity there. She says, she still says, she goes, I don't know what it was like, shit, we got to get her on the podcast too. I've got to find out what makes her tick. Oh is a bad dude. I think you guys have a good time. What's wrong? Nothing sounds like she's poisoned. Gets Sewn Joe. No you're not. I see what you're saying. I would have a good time if I was a woman, I scissors up. Good. She would have a good time with me. Your garrison would have a shot. Well even if she wasn't gay, hanging out with you guys in the woods chasing weight, foot turning, gay or lesbian

Speaker 3:          02:24:34       when the tooth, this fucking tweaker tooth that they can't run out to me with like four little rug rats, like all licensed vested kids like on it was like, I think it was the first of the month or something. You know, they just got their checks right. She was at like the canned food story and identity can store like cheap stuff, whatever. I was walking by and Oh we're big fans are big fans since you came to this like just this looks like the Simpsons evil baby like unibrow and all that, like frowning and she hands you this like kid, like two or three years old. She's all take a picture of your kids. Like am I hey. And I'm like, hey buddy, how to Cameron? He just looks at me and smile and he just looks really wham and headbutted me and knocked my tooth out. A baby headbutted you all like a toddler. Whoa dude. I find that harder to believe than bigfoot. Well, it was already. It was a, I got hit the face of the surfboard

Speaker 4:          02:25:24       there. Oh, is already loose. Well, it did cap. I went to, I went to Tijuana, dude, I got this deal captain t on, I got a bunch of dental market teal on and really do. My dentist is off the hook. He's like, this is crazy. He wasn't crazy. He's like, he's kind of the world's most interesting man because if I got a short fat Mexican boy Orbison like short fat banks get Roy Orbison like the thick glasses. He's funny. He just had a liver transplant like six months. I was as a, did you want to hear that? You got a minute? Yeah, so I'm going down. I was going to like this like legitimate clinic down in Tj that people go to the one next to the police station and uh, cause like they want like 20 grand. I'd been hit in the face with crab blocks and surfboards and pool cue, stuff like that.

Speaker 4:          02:26:09       And so I'd always cracked teeth and stuff. So I was gonna him all fixed. They want like 23 grand and the states. So I'm going down there and stop and see my buddy's Mexican dude. He's all, oh my fee, my fiance's uncle is a dentist and then he's got like, yeah, it's a cheaper clinic. You know, it's just like, like there's, there wasn't even electricity when I went there. Like the first day, you know, he hadn't been practicing cause he'd got a liver transplant, he's be a partier. And uh, we go down there and like, we're doing all this work and out of the second day, I've been the chair for like eight hours. He's like, we got to go look at pretty good. He's a total horn dog. He's like almost 70. He's a little short, chubby guys hitting on every girl. He's pretty cool.

Speaker 4:          02:26:46       He's fun, he's interesting and whatever. And he's hitting on all these checks. He's like, so he takes this giant strip are called like the Hong Kong cafe or something. You ever heard of that? No, it's like three stories. It's like one of those, uh, it's like grindhouse or something. You think when you want. It's like full narco place. Like you know, full inky Awana it's three stories. It's got like big hot tub. Are you wearing a gone squatch and hat while you're wandering around this place? I don't know what I was wearing, but I'm just probably just like I have now I want to picture you in a garland squash and hat. If I don't, if you don't mind. And the dude, he disappears. Like I didn't know that. I thought I apparently every girl in there was like a hooker and you can just get a girl, whatever and well he splits and we're waiting and we had a plan.

Speaker 4:          02:27:28       If anyone got to separated for a reason, we were going to meet at the truck back at nine o'clock or whatever it was, or eight or eight 30 we, you know, we'd meet at the truck was a couple of blocks away. Well, you know, it's eight 30 we don't see the guy. They were at the place. We leave, we go back to the truck, he's not there. Then we wait for like two hours. My buddy's like in going to school to be a nurse. So he had to get back head class like seven years. Her Dude, I can't wait for the guy all night. Fuck, I don't know where he is. You know, he's, he's Mexican. He speak Spanish, you know, he's probably all right. But he just had a liver transplant six months earlier. He'd had a couple of Margarita, so like we weren't Christ.

Speaker 4:          02:28:01       And so we go back to the states because we were just going to cross the border every day and he never comes home and the family thinks I kidnapped and that I'm part of a kidnapping because they looked at me and thought like sketchy. And so I'm getting accused of kidnapping this old man. So he never came home? No. So we're like, you know, like I was starting to get nervous and they were like, it was what'd you do it and be like accusing me like, you know, over the phone. Oh Wow. And um, I was like, oh, said, well I just got, and I was covering for the guy, you know, go on. Like, well I don't want to say all the guys split with a hooker, you know, you know, his wife's all upset. I'm just like, I don't know where we were in a Mexican restaurant.

Speaker 4:          02:28:37       I wanted some barrage drinking out of all those, you know, pain pills that day. And I was getting just whatever, like the shots and stuff. I said I was kind of groggy and you know, I just was walking around looking for some brother and I came, I didn't even know what, what restaurant it was. I walked for like four or five blocks, got laws. So I totally covered for the guy. The next day he shows up and he's like, and the family's like, where worry you don't know. I don't know what story he told them, but you know, you just said that I left him in a restaurant luck. He said something like that too. That was close enough. So he was so stuck that at this point of were like he's not a very good, he's a cool guy. They go party with, but he's not a very good dentist and at this point he's not a very good dentist. No. All he's all right. He's wasn't terrible. But um, so he uh, he goes, he goes blah. I thank you so much to all give you half off the rest of your dental work. Cause I was like, I'm not going to get any more dental work for this guy. I like half off. Fuck yeah. So that let's say you said, well fuck it. As long as it's cheap. Yeah. Oh Shit.
