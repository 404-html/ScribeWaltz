Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello Freak bitches. When we chipping away at this thing, like we know that politicians are doing an act. We know that there when, you know, I've always mocked the way they communicate, like the way that give speeches with long pauses and this very distinct pattern of behavior that's completely alien to anything other than a political speech. Like the only way this country survives, you know, like that kind of the strange thing that they do. But when, when we're always like chipping away at that were always trying to like, get to like be real key, get look, we gotta get, we gotta find out what's real and then we get this guy who realer than anyone's ever been. Yeah. And we're like, well, fuck this. This is crazy. And it scares us. That's the point of that documentary. We like to be lied to. Wwe. It makes us all feel calm and comfortable to be given a stable live than to be showing the real truth of how fucked up and unstable everything.

Speaker 1:          00:52          Yeah. I mean, the trailer has this tech stover over just like stock footage. It's just, and it's so scary. It's, uh, the, the words are, uh, politicians lie to us. We know, they lie, they know, we know, they lie, they just don't care. And I always like sent chills down my spine because it's so true and everybody knows it. And yet we're all engaged in this willful suspension of disbelief. Like, no, no, no, everything's good. No, no. Both Americans, both the greatest country on earth and it needs to be made great again. It's like we're all in this weird, like we're unclear on what were even arguing for that is guys like do crazy, insane cardio. Bisping's got insane. Cardio and the Diaz Brothers Cardio. Yeah. Nick has swam back from Alcatraz five times. Me. Whoa. Five Times. I said twice once. And he corrected me online. He said five now, but they, they can fit race every year.

Speaker 1:          01:49          They compete in triathlons all the time. Yeah. Oh My, you know, my, you know, my dad, uh, actually, uh, he was in a plane crash in his early twenties and it was off San Francisco and need to swim a couple of miles and that water real survive and Holy Shit, he crashed into the water. Yeah. Yeah. Most people don't know that it's, it's, it's pretty crazy. He and, and I'm going to, I'm going to butcher the details, but, uh, just, you know, from growing up, this is exactly, um, but what happened was he was in the army and uh, it was right around the time the Korean War was starting and he was, they were flying, they're doing a routine flight or something and they had to crash land in the ocean and it was getting night. And I, I believed, I believed the pilot died and I could be wrong on that.

Speaker 1:          02:39          The pilot died. But his other guy, he was with survived. So him and him and, uh, this other guy, they were there was swimming to shore and they got split up cause it was getting dark at night. Whoa. And so then now they're swimming alone. And anyone who knows, you know San Francisco is cold room. Yeah, definitely. Jazz water dump. Dump, dump, dump, dump, dump, dump. That's where they breed. Yeah. Early. Yeah. Great. Whites breed in northern California. There's like a nesting ground up there. Yeah. Fuck on now. Or you want to crash a plane? They're not where you want to swim from Alcatraz five times either in your underwear. I know. That's crazy. Yeah. I didn't know. I guess I've heard of that race. They know, but that's crazy. You've done that. Yeah. Wow. So your dad had a swim two miles. Yes. I'm like that made more. I could have been more, he'd fuck, but it was a long, I'm going for a couple hundred yards. I started looking for a log to hang onto. And what is the difference in the results from someone who does that? Because I know quite a few people who've done it that way. They've had injuries treated where they suck the fat out are

Speaker 2:          03:41          there isn't any, uh, any research to differentiate like one of these treatments versus another yet it's just not available. So it's all anecdotal. It's terms of like talking to patients. It's happening. I mean people are collecting the data but it's just not, you know, it's not at the mature stage where, um, you know, where it's available and we have, you know, published stuff to look at and, and personally know of anybody who's had really good results using the fat method. Um, yes, actually, uh, a physician friend of mine in Memphis, Tennessee, her name's doctor Laura Lenderman. Um, she has utilized that quite a bit and she's been very happy with the patients that she's treated in. Naturally. Some people do better than others, but you know, the, the real, the rigorous study of this though is still yet to come. That's really fascinating. Do you, have you considered trying that or you just definitely, yeah.

Speaker 2:          04:37          But you don't so far you just do, the stem cells haven't had anybody specifically request it and uh, everybody wants to lose a little fat and fix her knees. Yeah, I mean that's, that's probably taking things in a direction I don't want to be going. But by plastic surgery there are, we know there are a number of different options in terms of where these sources of the cells can come from. Um, bone marrow is certainly, um, had a lot of use and Daniel Needs da had that done. That's what he told me. Yeah. He had a pulled out of his hip and he said it was brutally painful then he was walking with a limp for like two weeks. It's a, obviously it's a procedure. Um, there's pain and there's, you know, morbidity. There's a consequence to, you know, putting a sharp object into the bone and drawing that bone marrow.

Speaker 2:          05:24          So it means, uh, a bad thing. I don't like that word now. It's, we don't like it either. In medicine, more bid is, we have our word, we have conferences called morbidity and mortality. And that's where he basically own up to things that you've done a terrible job with or explain, you know, why somebody has died as a result of your care. And it's a awful thing to go through. And it's critically important to be able to evaluate yourself and understand what things happen when they don't go the way that we want them to. So it's an important exercise that physicians go through to, you know, review cases. So I can only imagine. Yeah, no, I mean, especially if you're dealing with people that are broken apart. I mean, essentially as an orthopedic surgeon, you're dealing with people's bodies a failed, right? Your limbs have failed, ligaments have torn off. The bone and knees have exploded. I mean, you've told me some gnarly stuff in terms of the kind of injuries that you had to treat, and I could only imagine some of bad things. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          06:32          Okay.
