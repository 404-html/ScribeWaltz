Speaker 1:          00:00:00       They have different that I'm learning in between when I do comedy and acting. Is that like the last thing people really want to see from the on your own stage as you really get emotional, you know, but when you asked, you have to go to that

Speaker 2:          00:00:11       right away. Big Difference. We're live. Is it working? Oh my Jesus. Right at the end of the candid moment. No, I think you're totally right. Well, Ron Funches and I were talking about people getting mad. First of all, welcome to the show strength or having me being here, man. I'm pretty sure we were talking about people getting getting emotional on stage. If people get angry on stage that um, it shows the audience can feel it. You could say the exact same words and with, with like a fake anger as we were saying, like Brody was really good at like he had, he would fake be mad at you. I mean, it was, it was Louis Black. Yes. If you could see those exact same words, there's like a smile to it, right? You were saying that there's a nod or a hint hint of a nod.

Speaker 1:          00:00:55       Yeah, there's a little wink that lets you know that this isn't, this is a joke, I'm not really this mad about it. And is it usually an absurdity about the thing they're mad at? Yes. You know when you get, we all see those sets sometimes when like someone's recently broken up with somebody and then you like, you get that real anger and then you could say something funny but like, it's too fresh. It's too real,

Speaker 2:          00:01:20       don't want heritage, want to hear it makes them feel uncomfortable. And we were talking about how weird it is the, that you could actually have something that sounded so similar to that, but we could tell the difference, like with the exact same words, you know, with enthusiasm, just something's off about it. Something's off about that, you know, it's funny versus something's off about it where you know, that person's serious and a person like I was, we were just saying try to explain that to someone who doesn't understand English or doesn't understand human communication. They'd be like, what? How can you tell? Like, how can you tell it's fake? How can you tell us fake anger?

Speaker 1:          00:01:56       Yeah, that's what mates, I mean the language, so fun. It's not just about the words, it's about the intent behind the word.

Speaker 2:          00:02:04       Yes. And body language and posture and make a comedy so deep. You know, I love about it. Oh for sure. Yeah. I mean there, what we're trying to do is convey intent or trying to figure out a way to sneak ideas into your head where maybe you didn't see the punchline. Common. Yeah. It's a, it's a very strange art form. Like one of the strangest ever. So cause it's, uh, I've, I've always said it's almost like a form of mass hypnosis. Do you feel that sometimes, like can your middle of the sat and you, you're in the groove? Yeah. Um, a lot of ways. Um, one of 'em

Speaker 1:          00:02:43       I mean you, and you're a weird guy so it doesn't matter what it's going to get weird in multiple ways. But um, when I first started my acting class, um, I was talking about that, what, what, what my acting coach. And I'd be like, there's a point like if my sets really going well where I'm in the present moment of enjoying the set and saying these words, but at the same time I'm, I'm in the future thinking about what's coming next. I'm surveying everything that's going around me and I'm also still kind of like judging myself off of what just happened. So this thing happens where you're kind of like time traveling in a way where you don't exist in any one space of time. You, you just kind of like remove yourself from that. And when your sets going really well, that's the thing that my girlfriend and I have talked about is that you can hear these sets and hear these jokes. Maybe you can see someone said multiple time, but they're really good. Oftentimes you don't remember the joke like how many times people go back and quote a joke to you and they've got it half wrong because they've heard you with a thousand times, but they don't know they got the joke half wrong because you've hypnotized them. They don't even remember it, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:03:53       Yeah. Or some people remember shit. You don't remember anymore. Yeah, that's a weird one. Yeah. I've had people come up to me and tell me a bit, I go, what? What bid is that? And they'll tell me the bit, I'm like, when is that from the 2014 I'm like, I don't even remember that.

Speaker 1:          00:04:08       Yeah, just something you were trying out. Every now knows. That's what's fun now for me as I'm getting a little bit deeper than I'm coming up on 13 years is now, now I'm getting the point where I'm like, Oh this bit that I tried two or three years ago now work.

Speaker 2:          00:04:23       Yes. Yeah. That's really fun. Yeah, I remember that that time you are, you're essentially a a phd in comedy when you got 10 years in. Like if you have do real 10 hard years of comedy and then after that it seems like some, some guys, I mean it all depends on the artist, right? But some guys have their best work like 1516 years in or just starting to catch the groove and figure out what it is. You know, cause it's a, it's only understood by the people who practice it. It's, it's understood in a way by a lot of people who are, um, comedy fans. But that's similar to like me being a fan of music. I don't know shit about music, but I know what I like. I know when it sounds good. Yeah. I literally don't understand any of it. So I think there's those kinds of people too.

Speaker 1:          00:05:13       Yeah. I mean comedy is such a, yeah, I mean that's where gives great. When your peers, what's one thing that I loved about doing my special other than like people seeing it and being able to like I wanted to just make something and put something out. I had always done like small little things or guested on people's things and I was like, oh, I'm been doing comedy over 10 years and I'm sure a lot of potential. I want to present a male. And when I put it out and like people's reaction was great but the but my peers is what really made me happy that when I would get texts from, from like Malanie or time, some people being like you are or just be like this was your hour, this is you presenting who you are completely right and that and that. Um, when people can see the stuff behind it, when it's not just like joke, punchline, joke, punchline. When people can see like, oh you set this up, you did this rag, your structure is right and then you just wear yourself. That's what really makes me happy in comedy.

Speaker 2:          00:06:16       Yeah. Yeah. You're a funny dude man. I enjoy watching. You have washed to quite a few times the comedy store now in the main room. You very, very funny man. It's cool to see a guy like you put something down that's representative of your real, your real stand up, what you're capable of doing. It's a nice group to be a part of man. And you sound like you think about it a lot. I really appreciate that. When people think about like what it is we're doing, how do you do it? How do you do it? Like, do you write, do you write on paper? Do you write with a typewriter? Do you just write, just have ideas and you just keep working on them?

Speaker 1:          00:06:49       It's all a mix. You know, I like to say like I'm a, I'm more of a Fisher than a hunter. Like I'm not constantly like, oh, I need to write his down every day. I have the structure, but I'm constantly like, I try to make my house that we're, we're constantly always joking around with each other. There's notebooks everywhere. There's like little bowls of like with post it notes for me, whenever I, an idea comes, I had to make sure I catch it and then I had to make sure that I work on it, you know? Um, that becomes a different, it's just constantly keeping myself in motion so that I don't, um, get stagnant and I don't just do the same 10, 15 over and over again that cause, you know, that's where I think especially, um, when I first moved out here, it was always about like, oh, I got to show these people that I'm good, so I got to do my best work, my best work.

Speaker 1:          00:07:38       And I did that for about three months and I was like, oh, I don't have anything in the kitchen. I don't have any backup. You know, I haven't been building anything up. And so I learned very quickly, I think the comedy store has been the best for me or that it just being like I'm having to like follow people who are completely not like me stylistically. Um, having to follow people who I grew up watching. You know, I did a, um, night the other day where I had to follow, it was Sebastian and then Ron Wyatt and then me. And then I was like, oh, there's no, I mean, I'm like, ah, I'm confident in myself when people know me. But when it comes to that, it's like I'm the bottom of the totem pole on those three and I had to go out there and just show them that like, I'm capable.

Speaker 1:          00:08:21       I'm not going to mess up the momentum here. I'm just as funny as these people. You just don't know me. You haven't met me yet. That's the thing I've been listening to a lot. Like there's rappers all the time, but like this rapper, two Chainz where he said like, um, I just had to wait for, for the fans and for the game to learn what I already knew. And that's where I'm starting to feel now a new confidence. If like I know I'm good and I just have to wait for people to catch up on my wave and I don't. If they don't, they don't. If they do find just very jazz of you. Two Chainz

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       was the guy who debated Nancy grace about weed or remember that weight is going to kill you. He outlasted her. Yeah. That didn't work. I mean, it's hilarious now and see how many states have legalized it. In full disclosure, Ron and I smoked marijuana with young Jamie before this podcast. I guess weight as I do so many others. It's finally the stigmas slowly being removed slowly. Dude, I was a drug addict in the 90s when I started, when I first started smoking weed, I guess it was a not even the nineties it was like, wow, that was a nightmare in 98 or 99 somewhere around that. It's when I started smoking weed and uh, you were a drug addict. You were a drug addict. You're a marijuana user. It's wrong with you, man. Get your shit together. I'm like, man, you guys don't get it. There's two chains. There he is. Nancy grace. They put the stuff on the screen when it was going on. How many marijuana is does it take to overdose?

Speaker 2:          00:09:59       Jamie, send me that. Send me that. That is a fucking amazing quote. Did she really say that? No, no, no. It's a Twitter user. They put, people were tweeting whatever. Hashtag pot to blame. Oh my God. The Twitter, the Twitter user. Oh, styler. Tyler 2015 it says, oh Tyler. 2015 dude that, but it's 2015 the day of the tweet. It must be nice probably just as an account, but I don't know when it happens. It's a weird time dealt with is a space in there so that don't well, yeah, I think 2015 well whether, I dunno, I dunno. Yeah, whoever's, whoever that is, congratulations. Made me laugh my ass off. Yeah. That's funny. But yeah, that's what I love is a ridiculous lady. You know, she's, she obviously wasn't that healthy, you know, she wasn't, uh, a very, uh, fit health conscious person just worrying about weed. She's a crazy person. She was like Paula Dean, but she couldn't cook food. Marijuana, Moon. It's going to kill you. Rolling Fund chills. People still like that. There's a lot of people like that in the middle of the country

Speaker 3:          00:11:05       and then the middle of the country, sometimes it's still like, you know, there's the last thing might have been racially, you know, depends on they get the soccer we'd moms and everybody was like, oh, that's cool. And then you still get that. Like I did a podcast the other day and the first comments were like, either your years, two stones you're not doing. I was like, no, I just did a bad job. You know, like I could have just done a bad job. It didn't have any they they

Speaker 2:          00:11:27       need to do with me being in stone. Yeah. Like they know that if you were sober the podcast would have been way better. Yeah. You were sober man. You would have been so weird. It's true. It's all true. I used to have to go to this place to Inglewood wellness center, so it was kind of in a hood area. Um, a little bit sketchy. And then a while we're going there, like within a year or two later, the guy who ran it got shot and robbed there. That's how dangerous weed was. Cause he had to do it all in cash. They wouldn't let banks use checks, it wouldn't know, wouldn't accept checks and credit cards. So everything was weird. Even though it was medical and it was legal. You had to get it through nefarious ways. And then slowly but surely the stigma started to erase.

Speaker 1:          00:12:13       Yeah. Now you can just go to a store on Melrose.

Speaker 2:          00:12:15       Yes. So like what, how do you feel, you're wise man? How do you feel I should have qualified? That felt like neat. I'm setting you up. What do you think about making all drugs legal? Do you think that that would ever happen? And given what we know about prohibition, it sounds like an interview, given what we know about prohibition, like how bad it was for alcohol and how it popped up, the, uh, organized crime and I mean it caused a lot of problems. Do you think it would be a wise thing to make all drugs legal? That's a tough question

Speaker 1:          00:12:52       for me. I think that's, um, I think you have to start, I guess that's really trying to give people a lot of credit about their intelligence and their decision making. Right. And that's what you're trying to lead towards, that the, that the individual was very intelligent and they, they're gonna make their decision no matter what. And that by putting these stigmas who are just like, you know, like you know, prostitution and things like that, your PR, you're just adding extra jail time, extra obstacles, extra, um, life threatening situation.

Speaker 2:          00:13:20       And you're also penalizing people for their own life choices instead of propping up organized crime or as well as where they're pro propping up organized crime.

Speaker 1:          00:13:29       And if you've seen the effects of drug addiction, which I've had on occasion, you is hard to go like, yeah, this should it be okay. You know, I 100% agree. So it's, it's not that clean. No, I don't, they didn't. That's why. Yeah, that will be my answer is I don't think it's that clean. I think that it is a case by case basis. We'll do I think marijuana should be legal. I absolutely do. I think that you should necessarily legalize heroin. No, I don't think so.

Speaker 2:          00:13:57       I don't think so either. Um, but I think that, I think there's a real problem with infants realizing adults. The, the real problem is like if you are 25 years old or older and you decide you want to try cocaine, whose, whose, why, why can they say you can't do that? Why says who? So the zoo, why is that? Why, why have you catch me with that? Can you put me in a jail? It grows from the ground. It's a plant. They take that plant, they process it. They turned to cocaine. They still use it legally for, of and medical grade cocaine. They still use it for the flavor of Coca Cola. They still use the leaves. They still use the plant. Like who says I don't even do coke. But who the fuck do you think is making money selling coke? Cause there's a lot of coke. It's one thing that's completely why Miami exists. It's very,

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       no, it did. No other industry in Miami and there's so much money there.

Speaker 4:          00:14:56       Did you see cocaine cowboys? Mm, no dude. Billy Corbin, the guy who directed it was on the podcast yesterday. He's a, he's fantastic and he's got this new book, um, documentary called screw ball. It's about Alex Hernandez and steroids. In baseball and all this crazy shit. Oh, Brian Rodriguez, who's actioning does this is a different one. Hey Rod.

Speaker 1:          00:15:17       How I say he is that guy? No, that's Aaron. That's new England patriot.

Speaker 4:          00:15:22       Scott. Dan Weeds. Fuck my head up. That is the guy from the Patriots. Aaron Hernandez. Oh, okay. That's why I fucked it up. My apologies. Alex. Alex Rodriguez and uh, anyway, this, this guy made a documentary called cocaine cowboys and it's all about how crazy during the big cocaine days Miami was and how one year, the entire graduating class of the sheriff's Academy, the Police Academy, whatever it was, they either were murdered or they were arrested for corruption. The whole, everyone, the entire class, like the entire graduating year, like every, it was wild west chaos and there was all these pilots bringing in millions of dollars worth of coke and they had bags of money buried in their backyard. It's fucking crazy ass. Interesting. It's great, man. It's great. It's a two part series or it says there's two parts to it too.

Speaker 1:          00:16:16       Do you ever do versus Black Mafia family? You ever, you ever watch any documentaries about them? That makes me always interested. What did they do? They were a, a cocaine outlet and the early two thousands out of Atlanta and they transmit that at one point they were running and like most of the south southeast, um, head by this dude named big Meech. And um, then they decided like we should legalize and get into a rap, but they had never done anything like that before and they were very blatant about it. So the, all of a sudden these people who were came out of nowhere, we're just all on like every magazine. The, um, they have this thing where they're introduced interviewing police officers and they had this big billboard when you inland it Atlanta that would go, that would just say BMF, we own the world. And they were just out there and they would throw these big parties with tigers and stuff and they only had one recording artists. So it was just like, they weren't good at pretending not to be drug dealers. Wow. So it's very interesting you're saying

Speaker 4:          00:17:17       to me, well that whole, um, ramp businessman, I mean if you just stop and think about rap music other than some country and I mean really like a small amount of country would talk about murder and men. You know, I shot a man in Reno just to watch him and a few Johnny Cash, maybe some Merle haggard, Waylon Jennings, maybe some, some of those songs. But when you get to like Nwa, you have a different level

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       of aggression. You know, when you get to a [inaudible] body count, when he was doing that hard metal shed new soon fuck the police or uh, uh, um, I'm a cop killer. I mean, it's either Nwa fuck the police or ice teas. I'm a cop. Koeuch you hear those? Like you'd never heard of anything like that before.

Speaker 1:          00:18:06       Yeah, though the interest in time, because that's, I mean, talking about real anger, when we talked about before, this is all coming from real places and people who were Dylan Wa, you know, Los Angeles at a horrible time in, in La police corruption. And then what's crazy is in you, it goes the other way, right? They take that real anger that people connect it to and then they just started manufacturing it and then wrap becomes all these fake stories of like, I murdered all these people. I have all this money and, and, and then now it's just so far gone that it, it, it's hard to find. I mean now my favorite authentic rap is like people who are like, Oh, you know, I can't find my wifi password or are people just talking about raising their kids now I love that and rap cause then I'm like, oh, you're for real.

Speaker 2:          00:18:54       Yeah. Why not talk about anything. You know, today was a good day, right? I mean that was like one of the original ones, right? They used to be a song called all you could eat, which was Joe about go into off. But like today was a good day. I mean is that is like a classic example of someone taking the art form and completely switching it up and slowing it down and make it casual and relaxed and celebrate Tori. And that's from the same dude. Same Dude from Nwa. Nan Smart Man, smart man. He's a wizard of a writer to is, his lyrics are fantastic. You know there's like when there's lyrics in my mind when it comes to hip hop, there's lyrics and there's Nas. Nas does shit that you just go like that backwards song, you know, he's just call it cause like everything is. So it's like a, like a practice like orchestra, you know, as opposed to just being rhymes. Like it's sometimes he puts things together. So, so interestingly, you know, he's got his own special sort of appreciation for things.

Speaker 1:          00:20:01       Yeah. He's also very smart man. He has to be, he was the one that he won best. He invests a lot of tech companies. He does a lot of, he's begging

Speaker 2:          00:20:09       the investments. Why is young twenties when he wrote that? He's like 23 when that song came out. That's incredible. His Dad was like a jazz musician. So I think he grew up around the culture of creating things and being an artist. He's got that feel to him. He's like a hybrid, you know, in terms of it's like jazzy rap sort of. You know what I mean? Like there's something to, it was like almost like a classical trained musician slash. Rapper in terms of like how he constructs things. Yeah. Like Hamilton. I didn't see Hamilton. Did you see it?

Speaker 1:          00:20:44       No, I am but allow people once anything where a lot of light

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       that mayfly, why people get into a rap. I go, they probably not for me. Oh, I want to know any rap about the presidents. This one thing that like white guys have managed to infiltrate certain elements of, but like it's such a small number of like legitimately respected white rappers was a number M and. M of course. Yeah, for sure. Kid Rock in a way. He's kind of a rapper even though he, does she respect the rapper? No, no, no. But it's fun. Yeah. It's excepted. Mc Sir Macklemore Mc Mc search was great. I used to love them. I used to love third base. There were fun. Everlast BC boy Everlast for sure, but Everlast has changed and now wraps occasionally. I would think he would call himself more of a musician now. Jump around. He's still jumping around. Still jump around.

Speaker 2:          00:21:42       Well, not only that, the last shit that they put out was great to let stuff that he came in and showed us and he did some stuff with be real and some other guys. What do they call it? What was his last project? Shout out to that project. We'll find it. Jamie would find it. He's a shit, but like a or porn industry. That's right. War Porn Industry's. That's preposterous. Crazy name. Oh, hi. Do you have to be to come up with that name? Action Bronson. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Albanian. Oh, Action Bronson. Yeah, dude, I've never seen a man smoke more weed in my life. It never seen it. He just keeps going like he just ha hey man, look, we took a picture of the ash tray after it was over show all the, all the, uh, expired blunt, but I was like, this is, he's from that fuck. That's delicious. Show you ever watch that. I'm a big action prompts and fan. Do you allow them? He's so interesting to me. Do you watch the cooking show? Sometimes. Yeah. It's interesting, right? Like that that guy was a like a legit chef. Yeah. Yeah. And Matt and then just that. He's a great rapper. Great Chef. A great personality. Super Nice guy selling paintings now. Good for him. Sell it for $1 billion. That's $1 billion. You fucks.

Speaker 2:          00:23:00       That's 2 billion. That's amazing. That's a rug where a lot of weed bearings on it. Get that money. Action Bronson. Get that money. Yeah, man. I'm all for people selling the most ridiculous shit. I went to my agent's house once. He had this dope place in Aspen. I mean this place was crazy. Like, you know, Aspen houses like near the ski lodges and Shit and on the wall he had this painting and I said, I go, did this kid make this? And they go, no, that's a little, you know, some fucking obscure popular artists. I go, what is that? And they like, this is a really expensive piece of shut the fuck up. You're messing with me. They're like, no. It was like tissue paper. There was like different colors. It was stuck with glue and look a little piece of paper and some paint on it and like, get the fuck Outta here with this.

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       Like, what are you doing with that cannon camera? I mean, what the parade? No, no, that's why I was stunned. I thought it was his kid. I thought this kid made it. Maybe I'm, maybe I'm just dumb by definitely was, but a younger and dumber, maybe. I'd appreciate it now, but I don't think so. I appreciate, uh, all kinds of art. I appreciate distorted things, but I don't appreciate like just a bunch of Splat, you know what I mean? Look, it's gotta have something to it. Like Jackson Pollock, stuff like that stuff weirds me out. I was like, why is it so expensive? Like, I get it. I got it. You mean it's crazy. It's definitely crazy. But then you look at, you know, you look a classic like, uh, look at, uh, you know, some frank Frazetta stuff. Do you know who that guy, he was a, a fantasy painter homie from the 19th.

Speaker 2:          00:24:40       There's a poster of his, or I'm a print of one of his works out in the lobby that Conan the barbarian one with that, uh, that monster it, he's got a sword. He was, uh, this guy that do, he would do all the covers for Conan the barbarian books, just incredible artwork, like wild, crazy fantasy shit. And this is your type of art. Oh, just, I loved it when I was a kid, man, when I was a kid. You know, when I was a young, this seems like what you would like. I loved it. It was the best. His books are incredible. There's Robert Howard was this really tortured guy who was, um, a guy who lived with his mom. He had, you know, fairly poor health and he died suicide when he was like 36 years old. But he wrote a bunch of these books about a guy that was nothing like him.

Speaker 2:          00:25:28       They've got a guy who was this just unstoppable force of nature from this. He created this place called, uh, was Sumeria. We know what going to call it. What was his Samarian? It was Samarian. Is that what it was? We're Kona, Kona in the Sumerian, right. See [inaudible] created a whole world and in this world there's like, it was like very games of throne. He in a lot of ways, the original shit like no one to this day is really captured the books in a movie. Like Arnold was fun as Conan and then Jason Momoa was like a better fit physically. He was like a perfect fit. Physically more realistic as opposed to like being a bodybuilder. But nobody's ever captured like the feeling of the books because the books is just some wild shit. And it was all created by this one guy was like super depressed.

Speaker 2:          00:26:15       They're just write these books about this guy who just fucked all these women and killed everyone and just we'll just smashed his way through the world and power fan and things like crazy shit though. It was all him fighting dragons and monsters and demons coming for his soul and he ran for 72 hours and fight them off with a sword. And this would just quit when you're 12 years old like I was and I got into this shit. He'd be like, Whoa, this is why I get that as like, well ECW wrath was from me cause they was like titties everywhere and violence and blood and nails. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Cause I watched one yesterday on Instagram. Somebody had a clip of a guy and a girl and they're in the middle of the rain, the guys making out with the girl and then it turns on their body slams are down to the ground.

Speaker 2:          00:27:01       And I was like, well you could still do that and pro wrestling, you could still fake like fake violence against a check. I didn't know. Yeah. Oh yeah. Energetic arrest still. They obey. They slam, they fake slam chicks. That is crazy. I saw him do that. I was like, that could not have felt good. I lady stuck a blow pop up a dude's butt recently. Oh No, he, he didn't want it. What is this about his deck? He carried when you carry around blow pop, I guess, you know. Wow. Jesus Christ. Just Rathlin. Well, whatever you got to do to sell them tickets.

Speaker 2:          00:27:41       What is this Jeremy? This is the blow pop thing. No Way. Oh my God. He's really sticking it up his ass in his mouth. Oh my God. And then decide ticks him in the face and the guy's got his pants down. Wait a minute. That might be the greatest video I've ever seen in my life. The same guy who did the like the, you hit the deck. Shari. Right? This beached great white shark. That's crazy. Fuck. That's crazy. I can't show it. The shark was chasing a seagull. Oh, you can't show it and accidentally ended up in the beach. Why don't these guys grab it and pull it back in? The fucking matter man is watching you. Oh my God. The guy's throwing water on it. Just grab it. You just grab it. They don't know. Oh, how do they not know that's dead? It's dead now.

Speaker 2:          00:28:33       They can only last outside. Oh, it's still still breathing a little bit. That is crazy. That is an ancient fucking feeding machine. Look at the face on that thing, man. Just stop and think about what a mother fucking nightmare the ocean is. What a nightmare. Things like that. It just roaming around and US assholes. We think of being spiritual. Hey Man, I'm just going to get out of my board. I'm just going to get on my board, be monster food. No, I put my foot in the back out. I'm such a pussy when it comes to the ocean. I was in Hawaii, we went snorkeling, dive with the water and you staring down and it was cool. We were by this reef, but all I was thinking is I just need one of these motherfuckers and I'm never getting in this water again. One of those motherfuckers. I kind of want to do that now. I couldn't, I was too heavy before I was past the weight limit that you could go do some dive in. Did you and I would always tell myself I didn't want to do it by not want to do that. Yeah. You could tell yourself a lot of things, right? Yeah. Mitch Michener a joke about a writing that, uh, when he gets the wrong idea, he writes things down or

Speaker 4:          00:29:42       if he's lazy, he, yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:29:45       Not that funny. How did you lose the weight? Um, I really just change them. I got a trainer that was a big part of it and just changed my diet and, um, started exercising budget. Went from a guy who didn't exercise it all an eight multiple Philly cheese steaks a day to a guy who eats a bunch of boneless skinless chicken breast and protein shakes. And now I work out like six times a day. Wow. Yeah. Just seemed like I was going to die if I did.

Speaker 4:          00:30:16       So what do you do for working out these days?

Speaker 3:          00:30:19       Uh, you know, low weight lifting, a lot of 'em I don't see the day to, you know, just love back a little, a little biceps, you know, one arm rolls and whatnot. Just general weightlifting.

Speaker 4:          00:30:30       So, but you're, you do it a lot. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Do you, um, do you find has an effect on your mood on how you feel? Oh, absolutely. How do you, how much better do you feel and how much do you attribute it to the working out, the losing weight or both of them

Speaker 3:          00:30:45       gathering? It's a combination, definitely the, um, the Diet and, and just feeling better nutrition wise is, it is very helpful. Um, but you know, just doing two shows a night now, you know, they used to be a thing for me. I used to be like really tired afterwards and now, you know, no problem. I do a lot of um, voiceovers and, and other little things. And so, you know, I'm always bouncing around from going like doing shows in the weekend. They'd come home and then having to go do voiceover on Monday morning and taking care of my son and helping him with his homework and just being able to do that and not being like, oh, I'm just, I got to go pass out. I'm tired. You know? That's the really the, the biggest deal. Being able to take on more so than I'm able to, um, make more money.

Speaker 4:          00:31:30       So I was carrying my daughter around my shoulders the other day. She likes to get carried around. She's 63 pounds and, uh, while she's on my shoulders, uh, after, you know, 40 minutes or so of that, like it's fucking rough. Like it starts really hurting your neck, start getting really tired. And I had to put her down and uh, I was thinking like, how crazy is that though? There's a lot of people that just carry that much extra around with them all the time. They're always carrying around an extra 60 pounds and you don't think it's that much of a deal until you don't have it and then you walk with it. Yeah. You know, and you realize like, and it's this like, even if it's not that, like when a kid sitting on your neck, it's not like the ideal place to carry all the weight. They actually make a, um, a thing. There's a company called the outdoorsman. They make a thing called the atlas pack. It's like a backpack frame. But at the back of it is like one of those weightlifting posts so you could slide in Olympic a barbell or a Olympic played on and two plates. You put as much as 90 pounds on it, clamp this thing down and then it's sitting more on your hips. It's way easier to carry, but even that still it's fuck, it's fucking man walking around

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       with just 45 extra pounds on your back. Sucks.

Speaker 1:          00:32:42       Yeah, just getting, you know, just being like my mid thirties and being like, oh man, my knees are hurting. I didn't, I never played football. I never did anything like that. My knees shouldn't be hurting and, and just knowing, I think I had to just change a, just changed my mindset about like before when I was just doing stand up to do it and didn't think I was going to be successful, it didn't matter. I was just like, I'm this living Verdad Day gimme free pizza, give me whatever. And then I was like, once this things started changing a little bit, I was like, oh, I'm, things are happening. I still don't even really know what I'm doing. Let me, if I give myself a better chance and take care of my health, take care of my body, um, let me see how far I can push these gift, pushed these skills, you know, and it became more about not wanting to waste the opportunity.

Speaker 2:          00:33:30       That's very cool. That's cool. I liked that. So your love of standup made you sort of concentrate even more on your own body. Yeah. That crazy. Yeah. Like not your love of yourself, not your love of your body. Like of course like this is, you have to go through number of what you do in your life. You're going through it with your body, but it was your love of stand up to me like, God, I gotta do something about this fucking body. Yeah. That crazy.

Speaker 1:          00:33:55       Yeah. Low stand up alone, my son and we'll love of fashion and I didn't, you know, when you get to certain size all your shares, good dogs on them and you know, I want that anymore.

Speaker 2:          00:34:09       Yeah. Right. Yeah. It gets you getting to that triple XL. I, I'm happy whenever anybody does anything that, uh, that benefits their health, whether it's a for whatever your motivation, the end result is always good. It's always good no matter what motivations, positive or negative. If you want to prove somebody wrong, you know, or you just want to do, just do better. Just have a better path, you know? So it's so, it's so attainable for so many people. So many people could at least be way healthier. At least have way more energy at least like that. Not that feeling of just being like, Ugh, all day. And every time I cheat like a with burgers and fries and, and, and like milkshakes and shit like that. If I really go off the deep end with my diet, I feel like dog shit, I feel terrible. It hits me. I'm like, oh. And then you've got to realize, hey man, this is how a lot of people feel all the time.

Speaker 1:          00:35:05       Yeah. That's a big deal for me. The same thing, just going off a half a burger and, and was feeling so sick. And then I was like, man, I used to live like this. Every meal and my body, you know, is, is just the, you know, testament of what your body is capable to adapt to, you know. But, um, once you start going the other way and started really getting healthy, you really in your body becomes more sensitive to it and you really are like, oh, I prefer not to cheat. You know? Yeah. You still got to have that. You've got to have fun.

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       There's nothing wrong with an ice cream or something like that every now and again or some sort of a dessert.

Speaker 4:          00:35:42       But really it's the, they just think that your body has to be accustomed to getting what it needs. That's what it is. And for too many people that running on nutrition deficit, so when your body's just not getting it, what it needs for long periods of time, then you develop chronic inflammation and all sorts of other problems. And this is what people are really suffering from. You know, you're, there's, they're suffering from a nutritional deficiency that's probably lasted for years. They probably never did it. You know, some people, they just, they go 10, 15, 20 years without even thinking about their dying. There's eating dog shit. You just eating stuff that doesn't have enough nutrients and your body just starts to get weaker. There's no way around it. And if you just just turn that starting salads, eating a healthy fish and, and, and you know, some healthy meat and just take some vitamins. It takes a vitamin supplements, real simple, you know, slot and just get yourself some multivitamins, give yourself like a little thing of athletic Greens or something that get, get your fucking health online. And once you do, he'd be like, Oh, I've just, how much better this is all I had to do and I'm this person now.

Speaker 3:          00:36:51       Yeah. Mentally. So much better. Much clearer, much happier. Much happier. It's so hard though, cause we love mouth pleasure like [inaudible] you know, but to the point where people were poisoning their bodies to get mouth pleasure. Yeah. And it's just, you know, constantly pushed in your face. Everybody always knows. We talk about all the tie in on the cheeseburgers, 50 cents salad, like five, $6. You know, is you have to make that effort. You have to be able to want to cook at home and it's not, it's not made easy. And that's what I think, um, we become as a society, less cool and less appreciative of effort, you know? Yeah. But there's also, there's something really annoying about people that want you to eat healthy. Yeah. That to get off your high horse. Oh Fuck Outta here. If you're sitting there and you're having a burger and fries and enjoying the shit out of it and some asshole next use got Kale was shaved pecans and talking shit about your diet while they're pouring fresh olive oil on top of their shitty salad.

Speaker 3:          00:37:58       C'Mon man. Leave me alone. You know, even a little wine or enjoy something gross. Yeah. Taste around. I think as long as the, the majority of your diet is really healthy, then you can get in those fuck off days. It doesn't matter. Your body will bounce back. Just don't, don't put it in a deficit. That's the whole key. And that's where I'm coming from. And that's, that's why I had to, I have to keep reminding myself cause I get frustrated when I'm at the, like these parties or whatever and see, you know, there's food everywhere, craft everywhere. And I'm like, I have to stay on focus on his diet cause I'm like, I, you know, I'm 36 now

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       and I want to make sure that I'm at my healthiest and then I returned as devastate when I'm 40. You know, because when the natural aging process cakes and I don't want to be like kicking off still being, you know, two 30 to 200, hundred and 20 pounds, I want to be like 200 and be able to coast and be a hot old man.

Speaker 2:          00:38:55       Hot old man. Yes. Because it's also way easier to maintain is less true. Yeah. Um, it's way easier to maintain two than it is to like if you're in your 50s and then you start working out then is hard. It's really hard. Like, it's hard for me when I get out of shape, like if I get hurt or something like that and I take a couple weeks off, that's, you feel it. Like whoa. It's way harder to bounce back. Way Hard. Like twice as hard as it was when I was younger. Like you gotta be disciplined it down the horse. Yeah. Stay on a horse. That's what I've been trying to

Speaker 1:          00:39:29       do now is um, I think, you know, when you're younger, twenties teens or whatever, you don't want to listen to anybody saying those things. And now I'm like, I, I'm starting to listen when someone I know in one of my friends are 50 or older and they're like, hey, you need to do this now because yeah. One cheat meal for me is two weeks of work.

Speaker 2:          00:39:48       Yeah. Yeah. Um, do you do anything like athletic that's fun? Like, uh, that's one way to get good workouts. And like if you play a game, you like, tennis. Tennis is a very fast paced, people like doing that gives them a good car. Like Callans and tennis. Boxing counts in a boxing too. Like anything, meaning we don't have to box a person and I don't recommend you do, but just hitting a bag. It's like, it's really satisfying too. Yeah. I've been interested in getting in the boxing. I um, I tried some pro wrestling for a little bit. I went to a pro wrestling school. Yeah. What about, have you ever thought about actual grappling, like taking Jujitsu or get hurt easily? Well, you could, but you're a smart guy. I think you'd figure it out pretty quickly. It's, it's, it's a very unusual thing because, um, you think of people, like if you thought of someone who does, does Jujitsu, you'd think like, oh, like a jockish type person. But the majority of them that are really good are really nerds. That's what I've met a couple. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:40:51       People and they all like, um, they're similar to me. They're just kind of like the other side. I mean, we were like, oh, you like comic books and Video Games too. You just beat people up.

Speaker 2:          00:41:00       Well, they don't beat people up. They tried to strangle him. But when I say nerd, I mean, I mean it with all due respect that there, you know, cause I'm a nerd and a lot of ways with some things, but they, they're um, they're very like Jujitsu geeks. They're like people that are obsessed with uh, anything else, whether it's music or video games or they become obsessed, but they're doing it in the physical way that requires you to have a deep understanding of all the potential moves. It's very complicated in terms of like your ability to when you, when you're rolling with someone, say if I roll

Speaker 4:          00:41:34       with a guy and I know he's like a brown belt or a black belt or something like that, I'm, we're having an argument or conversation with techniques and the more of a vocabulary you have and the stronger your use of those words are as particularly the basic words, the better your chance of winning the argument. That's what it's like. Almost like this really complicated debate with physical leverage and they feel like that kind of reminds me of your style. It. Um, it definitely, like, it's like a lot of what I try to do is like figure things out in a, in a joke form. Right. I'll try. Like, what, why is that? What's that? So like that's what I've been trying to do over the last few years, I think. So in that sense it is kind of similar. That's cause you're trying to figure something out. Like it's, it's like a puzzle.

Speaker 4:          00:42:24       Like there's, I know there's some juice in this puzzle, like, how do I, how do I turn this into a bit? Why do I think this is funny? Like, what do I think I can say out of this? That's funny. And also people go, Oh yeah, Huh, hmm. You know, and if I could do that. And so in that sense, yeah, it's Kinda like, it's, but it's also, it's very human. It's humbling. It's very humbling because you getting strangled and like you just, you lose in power. He also just know, you know, like my uh, instructors, uh, John Jacques Machado, he says very famous Jujitsu black belt, world champion, Super Nice Guy, one of the nicest guys in the planet. But every time I grapple with him, it's just like a, uh, it's a matter of time for, he catches me with something. It's just, it's not whether or not I'm ever going to catch him.

Speaker 4:          00:43:11       That's not going to happen. This is just a total different world and a lot of that is his deep knowledge and understanding something and you being a smart guy, I think you'd get into it especially cause you love pro wrestling. So I was like, there's like you have at least you have a mindset for watching guys do things to each other and manipulate each other, which is half of what's exciting about pro wrestling. Right? Some guy pulling off some crazy move. Even if it's orchestrated, it's still a crazy thing that these guys are pulling off on each other. I mean I, I liked Mr Cause then I'm like, oh they're friends and they worked this out together. My problem is I know they're getting hurt and then not even really fighting. Right. I mean they're, it's, they're hitting each other for sure. They're doing things to each other and slamming each other.

Speaker 4:          00:43:58       It's all real. But those guys get banged up and they do it way more. So if you're watching the guy who's fighting in the UFC, they have practices that they can control. So if they know that they have a hurt, uh, you know, back or a hurt foot, you know, they'll put shit in ins to have pads on. They won't, they won't kick. They'll do things where they work around whatever injury they have when they're in the camp. You can't do that when dudes are throwing you. There's some, you've got a bad back and some guy's fucking picking you up and bang. Oh, they will. You know, they'll look just swept. They will do. But I, I do really like your point about, um, these, they can take some time off, I'm sure. Yeah. They can definitely make an agreement with each other. Hey, don't slam in my back is fucked.

Speaker 4:          00:44:43       But those guys get beat the fuck up. Talking to a Dallas page and Jake the snake to guys that have had on the podcast, which were, they were amazing and especially Jake stories. Fucking crazy man. When he tells you his story and what a nice guy, big giant, nice man, like just genuinely friendly and happy that everything's going well for him now. Crazy. But that's a rough business is my point. Like I, I'm way rather like real uh, grappling. Like I feel like real grappling for like if it was going to tell a person like what would be safer for your body? I think pro wrestling is harder. I think it's harder on you. I can see that they don't, they get saw, wham, you watch some of that stuff. No one wants you to know now about brain damage and knowing what you know now about that it's not even concussions necessarily as much as it's sub concussive trauma that doesn't knock you unconscious, but just rattles your fucking head.

Speaker 4:          00:45:42       And the repeated impacts of those. Yeah. Those guys are getting that all the time. Yeah. All the time. Yeah. No, I go back and sometimes that why some older wrath land and it really makes me cringe because they got a lot of guys could take it in. All these chairs shots straight to the face. Straight to the face. Yeah. It's all kinked. Ken Shamrock, take this one to the head that sounded like a gunshot. It was crazy. Dude. What is it about people getting smacked in the head? Um, Thompson girl has been sending me these Russians slap championships, his videos. Have you seen this shit? Oh my God. These guys stand in front of each other and smack each other in the face. Full clip. But some of them are doing a terrible job. They're hitting with their finger and left finger. They're getting fingers. And then there's other guys that are basically doing like a ridge hand strike to your neck.

Speaker 4:          00:46:34       They're clipping guys on the chin like this and they fall through it. It looks like a slap. But this is not a slap this, this is like a karate chop there. They're like going like that to the head and then it turns, I mean it's way harder. And then some guys are doing like a boss route and palm strike. They're hitting like this. There's the doing like a right hook to the head like that. It's brutal guys or get knocked unconscious. I like to see it but just with like older black moms, they used to be the dumbest thing ever. It was called like x arm and they would take these guys arms together and let them have an MMA fight. What? It was an MMA fight slash arm wrestling competition and they were taped together. It sounds so stupid. You can't imagine that not only was it real, but that the guy who created it was one of the original creators of the UFC,

Speaker 2:          00:47:31       like it's such a crazy idea. They just went for it, man, look, they taped these people together. Their arms are taped together. They can't even move away and then when they say go, they start fighting and they get an arm bars. Sky Floats. This guy's arm up, dude. He broke his arm on the table 100% if that guy keeps pulling on that thing, he gets his arm snapped. Yeah, no, I don't know if he actually broke her right there, but if the way the leverage of that table, because that guy's getting kicked in the fucking head while he's tied to that guy's arm. It's crazy. Pin His arm, pinned his arm or Kao him to win. What? What? What didn't work? I mean it didn't last. I can see why. Just sub crazy people can get, I love it dude. But that's real. And how this is the other one.

Speaker 2:          00:48:18       Chess. Boxing. This is a legit one too. I think they a box first and then they play chess, right? I think it goes back and forth. Oh, they keep going back and forth. That's a good move. But seriously, if you get out of the ring, what if you get chaos? Do you win if you win a chat? Yeah. Like if you win it chess, but you get flat lined in 30 seconds. Whew. That's also be really fun. If there is people who are horrible at fight am but really good at test. Yeah. And they would just lay down like you win, you win this part.

Speaker 2:          00:48:55       I'm just here for the chest. I know you guys suck at chess. Why do they have headphones on focus? You think so? Really? While they're playing chess. Oh, like to drown out the crowd. Oh cause people would probably say no to route. It looks like the fight was first. Yeah, there's sweat. By the way. Nights we're up to probably isn't even a real move. I just said some numbers and some letters. I don't understand anything when it comes to playing chess out loud was friends with this guy that was in prison in prison. He learned how to play chess with his words, you know, with uh, it was just in his head. And um, he was at this place that we used to play pool at in white plains. New York is called executive billiards, a classic old school pool hall. I think it's done now.

Speaker 2:          00:49:45       I think they, they just closed it down or something like that. Maybe they're renovating or something. But um, this guy was playing with this kid who was like a world champion chess player and this kid would come by and play pool. This really young kid like like 1516 years old and the two of them were sitting there playing chess with each other, like just saying, you know, night to queen to or you know, whatever the fuck it means. And the guy would go stand there, go a rook to six, blah blah blah. And they would go back and forth like this. I'd be like, I was like, what are you imagining what they're seeing? Like what are they seeing in their head? Or they seem like these things move around in three dimensions. Are they looking at it as a grid? How are they keeping track of where they're fucking pieces are?

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       It was humbling, very humbling as it's just strategic mind that I do not have. What was interesting to me too, cause it was a very young man. I think it was like 23 or 24 I got to see how fucking smart this guy was. Yeti still wound up in prison. So it was like, okay, like all right. Just because someone's a criminal doesn't mean they're stupid. And just because someone smart doesn't mean they won't go to jail. Absolutely. Those are two things I saw talking to that guy and uh, he, he was in the middle of the game once and he was gambling with this guy and this is the guy from prison who was like Super Smart Guy, very sharp guy. And um, he was talking to the guy who was playing. He said, dude, my wife told me if I don't get home by 10, she wants a divorce and a 10 o'clock rolls around and he yells out, I guess I'm getting a divorce.

Speaker 2:          00:51:15       It's like two hours later and he'd just racks the balls. He was there till like two o'clock in the morning. But it was hilarious. He just, he, he said like as they started playing it, my wife says, if I don't come home by 10, those are weird times, man. Growing up, um, in a like a, a suburb of Boston, which was a really nice place. I grew up in this place called Newton, like real quiet, quaint little community to go from that took the CD pool halls of New York was really weird for me. Very, very educational. I got to see all these like street hustlers, I get to hang around with these guys, be friends with a lot of homeless guys. Like I had guys that were like a pool players that wound up staying on my couch. They had nowhere to go, you know, a couple of them.

Speaker 2:          00:51:59       And uh, one of them who became my best friend, this guy named Johnny, but it was like we'd be in all these weird places gambling like he's weird, strange places with these guys who were like these semi professional players playing for hundreds, thousands of dollars. And it has to be a big crowd of guys all gathered around. And B, one, two in the morning. And I'd be thinking, these guys, these are older than me. Men, like they don't have families. Like what did they do? Like this is a whole separate culture, you know? And you were in the underwear. Oh, it was in a lot of ways, men, a lot of ways. It was very underworldy. I was obsessed with it to men. I just wanted to play pool all the time. I wasn't very good. Um, but the guys I was around were very good. I was around a lot of guys who are very, very, very good and you got to see like the excitement of these.

Speaker 2:          00:52:46       Uh, it was like, it wasn't just excitement that everybody was gathered around [inaudible] and that they were playing this game for a lot of money. It was also the excitement that we were bending the rules. We're all just a bunch of men hanging out at this smoky place at one o'clock in the morning on a Wednesday and, and everyone is in it together. We're all just in some way deranged derelicts, you know, some Weirdos from society that can figure their way to be able to be at this place at one o'clock in the morning on a Wednesday. Like, why the fuck are you here man, I don't, you have responsibilities. And no one, there hadn't been responsibilities. Everyone. There was some sort of either a professional gambler or they had like some, one of the guys was a fireman who would, they would, they would put them on these 24 hour shifts and then we would have a couple of days off and just come to pool hall and hang out.

Speaker 2:          00:53:36       Watch guys gamble. I mean it sounds similar. Didn't stand up. Oh yeah man, man. The myth fifth. Well that's one of the reasons why I fit in there from stand up, you know like starting doing stand up from 21 then being around these pool hall guys when I was like 23 or 24 I was like, oh you guys are like my fucked up friends. And I like, it's like too many people out there think that there's like only one way to live your life. Like there's a, there's a bunch of ways to live life. There's a lot. Yeah, it's a whole lot of worlds and everybody wants you to think that Darryl way of living life is the way you should go about it. It's real tricky because they all want like the sort of confirmation bias they want. They want you to confirm they want to. Well, it's more like a, a confirmation desire. They want you to confirm that they're doing the right thing. If you listen to them and then you become happy and uh, you know, they, they come up to you and they go, hey man, I'm really, really excited that you, uh, you told me how to do it this way because now I'm just living my life much better. Thank you very much. That people love to hear that. Like, Hey, I'm right then I am living my life the right way. It's not right way.

Speaker 3:          00:54:42       No. He know how many paths. Yes, be nice. Be Positive, work hard and do it. Do what you want, man, that's moving. I would have never got here if I listen to people, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:54:50       it's impossible. They don't even know what they're saying. People give you advice when they're absolutely not true what they're saying. They just say track. They practice on you. They get, sometimes people give you advice and it's real. Sometimes people have great advice. Sometimes people are really mean. Well, and sometimes people are just practicing.

Speaker 3:          00:55:04       Yeah. They're like, this is in general. How can anyone give you advice that does, doesn't relate to something that happened to them. You know, they're only going by their life experience. So that was one thing. Um, I learned from the Chris Jericho, another wrestler where he was just like, you don't listen to unsuccessful people because they don't know how to do it. Why would they tell you? Of course they're going to tell you you can't do it because they couldn't do it. A successful person will tell you, you can do it. Most people I know, like if you tell someone that, hey, I want to go try comedy, you know, if you've only, if you have the balls to get up there and do it, they're going to support you, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:55:43       Yeah. And there's this planning those people out there on both sides. There's plenty of people out there that will give you good advice and really care and want you to do well in your life. And there's plenty of people that don't want to see anybody doing any better than them and then not doing that well. There's a lot of that. There's a lot of that that's a sickness that we've got to forgive people for. Cause I had it when I was a young man for sure and I think many of us struggle with it. It's one of the things that made me realize that I was looking at stand up the wrong way and turns where like other people to stand up. And I was looking at other people stand up as like a comparison to mine in that uh, I was judging like who's the best? Who's doing better? Who's this? Who's that? And I realized like that is so

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       stupid. Like I should just be a fan of comedy and do comedy. And so I shifted the way I thought about it. So it's instead of like, when I would see someone killing, I'd be like, God, I wish I thought of that bit or a God, he's doing so good shit. Now I have to follow them instead. Somewhere along the line, I got to a place where you're like, this is great, this is funny. Like I love the fact that this guy's fun. Now I can become a fan of comedy again. Yeah. Instead of like being wrapped up in my own creation of it and producing my own stuff.

Speaker 3:          00:56:54       Yeah. Well I always not though always on a similar journey. I was very competitive, not but maybe a year or two ago. And again, in the relationship that I'm in now has been very helpful because she's a big fan of comedy and she always wants to watch comedy. And so then I'm always like, okay, I have to just not be, I just have to enjoy these people too because yeah, you're right there. They're great. And, and, and I had to learn, like I don't want everybody to be doing the comedy that I'm doing or I'm not special. I want to see all these different types of styles. I think, I mean the fact that me and you are in this room together and we both respect each other's comedy in our comedy worlds apart in different, you know, just two completely different styles. But we both respect each other because we both know that we are authentic in what we do. You know, I, if I were to try to be like you, that would make

Speaker 4:          00:57:44       no sense. I was trying to be like, you know, people would go, what's going on man?

Speaker 3:          00:57:51       What are you doing up there Joe? Smoke too much slow down man. You want that? What does that self Kratom

Speaker 4:          00:58:04       a lot of people on that cradle. No, I respect the fuck out of you man. And I respect your process. You know, you're uh, like we were talking about it as a, as an art form, as this um, structure based, you know, like you, you structure things, you know how to set things up is so important. Then we don't have anyone to tell us how to do it. We have to kind of like learn from each other and learn from the greats of the past that we can, you know, we could wash. But it's in a lot of ways it's sort of an undocumented art form in terms of the creation of the art form. And part of the problem is that everybody has their own way of doing it. Like that's why I asked you like, do you write down, do you, uh, do you type, do you just have some, some of the best just to have ideas and they don't write shit.

Speaker 4:          00:58:48       And then they go on stage a lot and then they work those ideas out when they're on stage and they work those ideas out in their head and they keep everything in their head. You know, there's a lot of guys who are really great who don't, they don't write, they just write in the moment. They're right on stage and they have ideas and they flesh them out and he continued to work on them and they just stay active. And I never have to actually sit and write. And there's some of the best. And then there's guys who write every day and there's some of the best. And I, it's like, fuck man, I don't think there's a right way to do it. I think is it just us to have, you just have to care and you have to be trying to get better? Yes. A hundred, hundred 70

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       zero. It's gotta be effort and not going back in. Like what I'm trying to do now is as be a little bit more picky because I go, I like did my special, and then I go write a joke and I go, oh, you're basically doing an extension of what you've already written and like, don't, don't do that. Like, let's try something new. Let's go some more. If you don't have it this, just go up there and relax a bit. Live life a little bit. Yeah. Because most of my materials personal anyway, you know, I don't really do a lot of topical, so for me to generate material, I usually have to be active in life and that things happen to me.

Speaker 2:          00:59:56       Yes, yes. Yeah. I think, um, I think it's really important to be around a lot of other people that are doing it really well too. You know, I'm, one of the things I really get out of La was on any given night I can go to the store and watch someone murder, you know, quick all the time and were like, no, I'm one person, like six, seven, eight people Kaelin in their own way. And you just around that, did you just get this like extra juice out of that place? Man, you know, you get extra juice out of La, out of the store a lot of times have the Improv. It's like there's just, there's so many of us here. It's a crazy hive of comedians if you really stop and think about it. Yeah. You know, I mean Jean Diaz and Burger and you know, a Segura is here, you know, you're here. Deleah I mean it's just fucking every week that places mom Marin's here. It's like Theo Vaughn's here. It's just, it's chaos. Sebastian's here. Yeah. Like Holy Shit. You might get a drop and from Chappelle and you all the time. Yeah. All the time. Yeah. I mean, it's one of the weirdest places ever in terms of like a hive of comedy. And we're so lucky to be in that hive, man, be watching all the shit go down in 2019. You know, this is an epic time for standup.

Speaker 1:          01:01:14       Yeah. That's the thing. It ain't no, don't like to bring it up all the time. But like when something like what Brody's passing happens, I have to go like, oh yeah, it's stabbing and so in the rat race and so competitive all the time and worried about what you're making and realize that the true gift is the time that you get the spin with these truly unique minds. You know, the people who don't think like me at all, people who like you say you, I see jokes every day where I go, oh fuck. Like how like that was in the air for anyone. Yes. Yes,

Speaker 2:          01:01:46       yes, yes. That's the weirdest feeling, right? When you're like, fuck, how did I miss that? God dammit. Tony Hinchcliffe has a joke right now. I don't want to give it away, but, uh, it's, it's one of those where he's, he does it. I go, God, I miss that. So good. Santana has got this bit about candles. Then I'm like, ah, you know, I worked with them all weekend. I was in Austin with him. He's great. Yeah. I love him. To George Perez to George Perez murdered, murdered in Austin. Oh yeah, it did. Cap City Comedy Club. I wanted to go do the comedy for a goof. I need to, uh, do more comedy clubs. Uh, it's just such a different thing that you're rich comic,

Speaker 3:          01:02:25       do the club as a goof.

Speaker 2:          01:02:32       You make a decision whether you want to make a lot of money or have a lot of fun. Yeah, true. Truly. Yeah. Yeah. And I'm, it's not that, it's not a lot of money to work in a club. It's, it's great money. It's not bad, but it's, um, it's a different choice. It's like the choice of a right now for me, the choices we'll, how about just trying to make my shit make more sense and more reps in front of different people. And, and, and more feels more different vibe. You know, every time you go on stage you're in a different place. Audience is different.

Speaker 3:          01:02:58       Introduce yourself to new people. Yeah. Well, I'm trying to do, I'm getting ready to go out on a tour and I specifically was asking my Mike, my people were like, I was like, I want to go to Huntsville, Alabama. We want to go to like, I want to go to these places that you don't expect to see me. And I want to see a, because I think it'd be cool to just bring in people who were like, hey, why are you here? And I want to see, um, that's why I'm going to Australia. I just want to see, make my comedy travel. And I will, I'll learn, I'll learn how to, I'm sure I'll go in there and I'll say something as too American and I'll be like, oh, okay. Right. And it'll just denote inform my writing and I would start writing more globally and, and you know, and those are the type of things I'm looking for it now.

Speaker 2:          01:03:38       They're, they're fantastic. Australia is great. They're like a alternative Americans. And I say that a good way, like in, and they're like a degree nicer than Canadians. So I could get Canadians who, where I say there's 20% less douchebags in Canada than there is the United States. You could always find bad people everywhere. But then you've got people from Australia, I think they take that another 10%. It's like one of the nicest people ever. They're so nice. Ah, can't wait. The fucking great man. Their shows or shows over there. Amazing. You know, and they're, um, they're, they appreciate it. They know most of our shit. You know, they understand most references and things that we will talk about. But if you knew a few about them, it would, it would probably help them relate to, but it's, it's a weird culture. It's, it's a place that I would totally live if I didn't live here. If I didn't live in America or it didn't live in Canada, I want to go anywhere. I'm not saying I want to leave America, but I said if I did,

Speaker 3:          01:04:31       yeah, but you travel and you go that you, you, you find a place. Okay, this is fun to visit. And then you find those places. I'd like to me like Italy is nice to visit by. Like, I could never live here, but then I go to Amsterdam and I'm like, I live here. This is like Portland,

Speaker 2:          01:04:44       this is great. But like Portland. Yeah, Portland sort of fashion itself. After that, when it became legal to have weed there too. Right. Have you, did a lot of those places were comparing themselves to Amsterdam way back in the day. You know, it's funny. Amsterdam was a place where people would actually go there to get high. It's like the, the very first high destination. Like people try broke, we're going to go to Amsterdam, get high.

Speaker 3:          01:05:07       I like going just for the vibe of like we were talking about earlier of um, no stigma and there is no, like someone, if, you know, I dropped something on the, wherever the people, oh,

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       you stoner. Like there's nothing like that in Amsterdam. And I love that feeling. It's a dumb thing here. That's just a remanent of propaganda. End Dumps donors that are real people. You know what I mean? There's always that time where you're running to someone who is too high and you're like, aw man, you're just fucking up the whole stereotype, man. You're perpetrating sir. Oh, you can smoke a bowl and others not coming out of your nose like, yeah, there was certain people that just get too high.

Speaker 5:          01:05:47       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:05:47       they just get too high or too weirded out by life. And you're like, Bro, slow down. Or right now you're okay. I know everybody's okay. Yeah, the end is horrible for everyone and anyone, but right now you're okay. So if you can't be happy now when you're okay and you're worried about the times when you're not going to be okay, that is madness. All right? So you've got a police off out of madness and be in the moment. In the moment everything's fine, but that's a tight wire walk when you're high as fuck. Right when you're sober

Speaker 5:          01:06:17       is it is.

Speaker 2:          01:06:20       So do you see they let that dude off the empire guys? I let them slide. I love it. It makes it so exciting for me. I've been, I've been, I lived them on class couple of days, told my girlfriend I go, I go. The craziest thing would be if they say he's not guilty because then you have to go, what happened? What happened? What happened? Did he bribe somebody or did some new evidence come forth that they had a bad investigation? Did the two guys that were his witnesses, did they get caught lying about something else? You know the witnesses against him, they might've caught them lying about something else and they don't know what to do and they have to abandon the case. Cause then they obviously know that he's a lot, these guys lied about something. Who the fuck knows man? I'm understanding I can make a guest and as they won't be educated but, and just know in Chicago in general, I'm in, my guess is maybe the way they were going after the investigation wasn't really above board. And if they, if they, if he's just like, I'm not guilty and they have to actually go in and present this evidence, they don't have, you know, they don't have what they really need to have, you know, like I don't, I don't think anyone's going around like,

Speaker 2:          01:07:29       okay, yeah, well then those two Nigerian Maca guys did attack him. Mager guys, it's so great. Well then also they sealed the case. So fun. Yeah, it's crazy. Yeah. If you wanted to like a good twist, you know, in the movie, like this is a crazy scene in the movie were crazy music is playing and you see Jesse Smollett come out in slow motion and put his sunglasses on and get into the limo guilty and he comes out in slow motion and gets in the Limo and then dudes are wearing ski masks and people are pulling on it. It's like, uh, like one ongoing story. And one of those Tarantino movies. Well you got four stores like pulp fiction battling it out. He's one of them where he gets not guilty and it becomes a big twist cause you feel like you find out that some behind the scenes shenanigans and shit that led to this cause what happens?

Speaker 2:          01:08:23       People are like, oh, he's never going to work again. But now not guilty. So does he get his own show? It's a good question. What happened? Well, the other thing is for live the longest time Chicago has been thought to be a place that is like a, you know, like things can happen there. You could, you could make shit happen. Right. Is that a fair way to say it? I love Chicago. I don't want to be disparaging, but there's been some, uh, some cases of corruption. Oh yeah. No, I mean that's where I was raised it very corrupt place. Most of our mayors and stuff go to jail.

Speaker 2:          01:08:58       So I don't think I'm being unfair. Yeah, there's a, there was a scene in a movie. What was the scene in the movie where someone's Chicago is the most corrupt big city. Illinois. Third, uh, most corrupt state in the country ties. Yeah, that's cray published February 15th. So this shit, this is recent. Uh, oh my goodness. Yeah. Um, I don't know man. I don't know about Chicago. I'd be talking out of my ass, you know, I know him a little bit. Tell me what it's like. It was very cold. It was very cool. We're up locked right then. Sometimes it's very hot. Right? Is he is either usually too cold and shooty a very hot and shooty and then the spring is delightful. Shooty that's the best verb ever shooting to shooting. This is a little too shooty over. That's fucking hilarious. Shooty yeah, it is a it's way, way, way, way, way too shooty.

Speaker 2:          01:09:55       Right. And um, do you think that people, I, this is my opinion, I want to know if you agree. I think the people in colder areas like Detroit and Boston, Chicago, like there are different kinds of people. There are hardier people than people that grow up. Like in San Diego. No disrespect San Diego. I'm sure a lot of you are hard, hardest fuck. But there's like a difference between people that have to shovel snow and deal with that fucking winter and be holed up and really be fucking freezing. Like when you come in from outside like fuck, fuck, fuck. And you appreciate the warmth of a nice restaurant or something like that. When you walk in from out of the cold people shoveling snow is, it's windy as hell. And then you got like very aggressive homeless people there. So you're going to, yeah, you're going to get tougher. I had to program that for myself when I moved from Chicago to Oregon because, and then taught as a teen. It was always like even my walking, my walking was too slow for Oregon because I would walk and I take a look back cause that's how my mom taught me to walk and Chicago's make sure nobody's sneaking up on you. And in Oregon they didn't have, they didn't have that concern. Yeah. Fuck, that's a weird way for a kid to grow up to men always be worried about danger.

Speaker 2:          01:11:11       One of the strange things about that is that it's very hard for people to get over that hump. It's a very hard for people to just calm down after they've been in a bad environment for a long time. You get wired a certain way and even though you're in a new place now and everything's calm, you're still looking out. You're still thinking this shit could go sideways. You've seen people go sideways. Yeah, yeah. That's why it's hard to be in a relationship with me. Something I miss about when it was snowing and you would go outside and it would be silent, you and your anything. It was one of some of my favorite times. I live in, in Boston or in Newton where I was. I lived right across the street from the Charles River and there was this like this big grassy area in front of my house and you just look at, oh, the white, it would just be Oh, thick white snow and it muffled everything like it looks, so it was sound insulation for everything.

Speaker 2:          01:12:07       You didn't hear shit. You know that feeling, Jamie, you grew up in Columbus. You know when you get a like a big snowstorm storm it's like, it's just like sound deadening everywhere. There's no hard edges anymore. Everything is covered with snow. It's just, it feels good. It would feel good. It would feel like this is nice. As long as you have food, as long as you know it's going to go away. As long as the plows are still running, as long as you have either firewood or backup generator or something. Sometime that electricity cuts out and then everyone gets scared. Noddles up together. I remember that episode of I love Lucy. Did you ever have that happen? Yeah, now did take the fine. I did too. Everybody does. If you live in a place where its nose at some point in time the power goes out.

Speaker 2:          01:12:53       I remember these guys in Toronto were telling me their power went out for two weeks and it was fucking crazy cold like in the Zeros and below zero and they were doomed. I mean there's ice everywhere. I said need the power lines fall down. They had a, you know, like frozen rain had come and covered everything when ice and things were breaking off and power was outed and like blocks and blocks and blocks and all these people in fucking the dead of winter in a city we're endanger day. Scary, scary shit man. Because you know me man, you firewood, you don't have a place to burn it. You're in a goddamn apartment building. What are you going to do? Everybody's fucking freezing. No one's going to help you. The phone doesn't work. It's not fucking power is stuff you think about a lot though. Right?

Speaker 2:          01:13:36       Cause you only talk about that like the so coddled wit you know about the thin veneer of civilization. That's what I think about and when I think about it more than anything is from natural disasters. That's what I think about. I think about the potential for natural disasters. There's this, it can happen at any moment and most people have no preparation for it whatsoever. They have no idea what they would do. It just seems that if you, if you're paying attention to history at all, you know that this happened. It happens all the time. It almost just happened that one that you were, uh, you pulled up the other day that happened in December, some asteroid that blew up in our atmosphere that had five times the power of a Hiroshima.

Speaker 6:          01:14:20       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:14:20       10 Times, 10 times the power of Hiroshima blows up in our atmosphere, mother Fucker, man, that hits, that hits Chicago right in the face. That can happen. I mean, it's happened all over the world before. There's a total possibility that we can get hit with a chunk of iron the size of a fucking ocean liner and it just slammed into a city, a nukes, that city. That shit happens. I think that, yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:14:47       Did that bother you or that it make you more free?

Speaker 2:          01:14:51       Uh, I would lie to you. It makes you more for, it makes me more free. I don't think that's true though. I think a, it definitely makes me sound paranoid, but I've thought about that a lot and it's just, I'm just being accurate. But it also, um, uh, pretty, uh, pretty. You can be boat. Yes. I tried to be pretty present. Try to be pretty here. You know as much as I can. And so if you're here, like if you present and you are aware of all these things, it's just a slippery or grip on present, but you could still be present and aware like this ain't going to last. This whole thing ain't going to last. So these people are building buildings right next to the goddamn ocean, the oceans rising, you know it's, there's a real possibility that rocks are going to slam it in this mother fucker any day now or a hundred years from now or five years from now. Nobody knows. But one day it's going to happen and it's going to be, and the fucking earth is going to ring for a million years. That's what happens.

Speaker 6:          01:15:50       Okay,

Speaker 3:          01:15:50       nice. I mean, I'm okay with that because it's out of my control in that regard.

Speaker 2:          01:15:55       It's a good way to look at it, but it's also

Speaker 6:          01:15:59       okay.

Speaker 2:          01:15:59       Seems like Horse Shit because this world seems very permanent. This moment seems very permanent. Life seems very real. It's been real my whole life every day. Right?

Speaker 3:          01:16:08       Life is real. You know, I don't, but that's it. You know, this too shall pass. Right. You know, you got it. You always know it and nothing is, is true. I think that's one of the biggest life lessons I had by having a, I'm not most stable childhood moving around a lot and bouncing around to different schools in different states where I was like, I learned very quickly that things aren't permanent. I learned also that things are very relative to whatever area you are. That's what really helped me. Um, I think held my voice as a comedian now is that I've learned very young that like what's cool is very relative to wherever you are. You know, the things that were cool in Chicago, people weren't on in Oregon and things that were cool in Oregon or like Greece, you know, they would get beat up in Chicago. Yeah. So I learned very quickly it'd just be like, Oh man, just joy what I do and just like what I'm about, it's, um, it's really helped my life be more, more peaceful in that way. And that's why that, you know, 36 year old man who owns shit ton of wrestling action figures.

Speaker 4:          01:17:13       Yeah, that's half of the life is trying to find the balance between being satisfied and being motivated and being happy and just being, again, just being present, you know, just finding out what you actually enjoy. Just doing it just to that thing, you know,

Speaker 3:          01:17:32       was wrestling action figures and that's where it's weird. The Path. Did you think of that thing would be like comedy, but then you also learn that you can't, you can overdose on that and you can be over. Um, cause that's the thing I like when I was started headlining and then I w you hear these stories and what w when I was younger, when like when Greg Geraldo died or Patrice died and I just get these parts where I might men that's like [inaudible] obviously all due respect to them, not as I said, but I was like, I don't want to die on a road. That's not how I wanna live my life. That I don't want to be found in some hotel somewhere. I want Mike, my family around me and people who care about me. And, and that really made me be like, okay, I have to think about more than just like each individual set. I have to start thinking about what do I want to give back? What do I, what do I want to do bigger than that? Like do, what do I want to do if I just want to do the road for fun, if I just want to, like if I want to move into something else when my son's 16 he's going to be going, hopefully he'll be going to college soon and I want to be like, I want to be able to spend more time with him, you know?

Speaker 4:          01:18:40       Yeah. Your, your life as a comic, you know, it oftentimes I find that guys go through these stages and then the first stage kind of feel like an imposter. I feel like a fraud, you know, you feel like, like, you know, I'm not really that good at this. And then you, you get to a stage where you feel like a professional when you feel you're a professional and then you start to take, put more responsibility on you, on your work. You know, for me, I think that's right around when it happened with me, somewhere around 10 years in, I decided like, Hey, I gotta I gotta treat this like I'm an actual professional and stop fucking off. I was, I fucked off a lot. I went through periods of years where I didn't write anything or just, it was really lazy and I had the same sex.

Speaker 4:          01:19:20       I was doing TV show shit, like a sitcom stuff and I just wasn't, wasn't working on the act at all. But, um, it's just such a more, um, energized time right now in comedy. You know, guys like Santina, like when we're talking about all these guys that are coming up all, every, having all this good comedy around you, it's almost like, um, like it raises everybody's vibration. Like the whole, the whole community like is the better everybody gets instead of how everybody used to approach it where everybody was competing against each other. And then you kinda like have weird feelings when you're running each other. Now everything's like a different kind of odd,

Speaker 3:          01:19:58       yeah, it's a, um, it's a healthy competition. And one thing I'm really liking is a change of the presentation of um, people being more cognizant of like I want to present like just dressing up more, you know, looking nice or not necessarily trying to like suit up or anything. But I see more and more posters are more and more things where the people are clearly putting work into their graphic design and their heart are even. Um, and I don't want to speak for, for, for female comedians at all, but like I'm just noticing a trend more where women are being not cause it used to be either like I am the hot girl or like I'm just a dude. Like you don't, don't worry. I might be high, but you wouldn't know because I'm wearing a Hoodie, you know? And now there's just more of these women being like, I'm just me and it's, I'm might be hot, but that's not a part of this.

Speaker 3:          01:20:52       And, you know, and I see that a lot now, but they'll still go out there and know, put other their posters where they're like in a bikini or whatever. You know, cause it's like, why wouldn't you? Right. Like, just like when I go and I wear a suit, you know? But I love seeing people take charge of that, of what they're presenting and not just because, I mean that's how I use the dress all the time, which is where a big purple Hoodie or whatever, you know. But now I'm more like, I want to look more like a, I guess I'm like a star.

Speaker 2:          01:21:19       Well there's definitely something to I, you know, I remember the Martin Lawrence days when he was on top and me wear those crazy outfits on stage or Eddie Murphy in Ra, we wear this crazy leather jumpsuit. You know, like he put a lot of effort into what he was going to wear. It delirious. That was another one. Like Eddie Murphy had these crazy costumes that you could only wear if you were doing standup. And a lot of ways. I mean it was the ultimate Eddie Murphy costume. You know what I'm saying? Like if you really think about like him shirtless in a red jacket. Yeah. Like with Kennison, what do you picture? You picture the Baret you pictured the overcoat, the picture of the white sneakers. Like it was his crazy outfit. He had like kind of a like you would kind of expected that look from him. But with Eddie Murphy's, Eddie Murphy was like, you know, leather like colored leather and you know, it was very powerful. It was very bold, which was like his comedy, you know, it was like letting you know this is a special night is the night. He doesn't dress like this every day. Yeah. This is, yeah, he's on stage doing a show like that.

Speaker 3:          01:22:18       Yeah. Yeah. Like you and just people who think about the, the full presentation. I mean even doing that, like the playlists that the club plays before my show, like I've been setting that up now. Right. Cause I want a vibe of mostly fish. I got to

Speaker 2:          01:22:35       Piss so bad. So I want to keep going though. I don't want to stop. So, uh, I was just did two podcasts in a row and I drank too much coffee. So, Jamie, why don't you guys talk about something you have in common. All right. Okay. You guys have in common, I smoke smart pot. Yeah. Oh, for sure bro. Have a freshie thank you. Have an extra one for the road too, sir. You're welcome. I'll be right back. Talk amongst yourselves. Okay, nice. Welcome Taylor. Ron Funches the experience, right? You have your own podcast too, right? I do. It's called getting better. Uh, what Ron Funches when we just kind of,

Speaker 3:          01:23:06       I talked to people who I admire are people who I want to learn from, people who have accomplished things I want to accomplish or have gotten better in some form in their life. And I, uh, ask him about it and about setting goals and stuff. Do you ever have, do you just set it up that way? Like I was a conversation? Or did you put more thought into like, I want to ask them these kinds of questions and get these kinds of things? Um, I mean there's just, there's some set questions I usually just ask people about, about their goals and I asked them about some advice to give me. But other than that, it's usually just some type of free form conversation. It's just, you know, it's funny sometimes, uh, but for the most part it's just like, um, the reason why I wanted to do it is because I was a big fan of like Patton Oswalt's website, the spew and stuff like that.

Speaker 3:          01:23:54       When he had that, and I noticed like when it was on Twitter, there had been a shift from people who are like, used to be very supportive of me, especially when it was fatter and stuff. And then it came this thing of like, anytime I would try to post something positive, he will be like, why the fuck do you fuck? Who Cares? You have money and you and you just, you know, and I just want to be like, no, I'm not on a different side of the fence because I did these things. I, I'm like over here being like, anybody can fucking do it if my dumb ass dead. It, you know, so it just became more about like, to me like talent and, um, success is more like this ocean that we can all drink from. And it's about like, how did this person get to that ocean?

Speaker 3:          01:24:37       I don't think there's people who are talented untalented finding out their past sort of to where you are now and what keeps them motivated now. You know, like once you, people have some success with what, why, what keeps you going? You know, it was a question I would like to know from Joe, you know? Well he just walked back in so maybe we can find out. Hit me with a question. What keeps you motivated? But you're so successful, you got a lot of money. You're doing okay. Everything Ufc you like accomplish so many things. So what, what makes you go to the store on a, on a Tuesday night,

Speaker 4:          01:25:10       uh, to work on, stand up? Um, I don't look when you, uh, when you get successful at something, the best thing that it does alleviate stress, but it doesn't change the motivation. The motivation is always to create something that I like, that I can be proud of, that the people enjoy. Most importantly, there's a bunch of people that watch my standup. I gotta I gotta work at it. I don't want to be an asshole. I don't want to be that guy that you come to see my show and you'd go prepare. He didn't care. He didn't try, you know. Thank you. I'm not going to be that. So I look, we all have that sets. I'll have bad sets. I'll try. I'll try my best though. I fucking try my best and I'm going to keep trying my best. Cause I think if I don't, I leave. I leave a doubt in my own head that shouldn't be there. If I do my best and it just doesn't work,

Speaker 2:          01:26:05       I have to figure out what was wrong. But if I don't do my best and it doesn't work, you feel like shit. Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:26:12       That's true. But I think that, um, I still feel like shit, even if it doesn't work and I did my best, I feel like a failure rather than a loser. Yeah. But, um, I think when I was younger going to doing comedy my twenties and it may, it might have just had been a Portland thing. There was always kind of this vibe of like, I didn't try my best. If I tried my best, I would have crushed it, but I didn't try my best, so I didn't really fail.

Speaker 2:          01:26:38       Yeah. That's a trap that a lot of comics get into when they are in front of a small crowd. No more that. Yeah. Take a little more. Damn. Ron goes deep. Um, and um, one of the, you know, those moments when you're a young comic where someone says something to you and it really gives you a nice boost. So like you feel great about it. And uh, one time, uh, I was at the store and there was maybe like 12 or 13 people in the audience. The most was like, no, I'll keep going. It was, um, and Paul Mooney was in the back of the room and, uh, he's 12 or 13 people. I'm just doing my act and Mooney starts laughing hard, like a supportive laugh, like he's with

Speaker 7:          01:27:23       you. Ha Ha. Ah, he's Clap Ben

Speaker 2:          01:27:27       and the knee came up to me after the show and it goes something to the, something to extent of your real comic. Like that's what makes you real comic. You do those real shows in front of all those people. You know, you do a real show. Yeah. You don't, you don't like say, oh, there's only 10 people or 15 feet. You don't have asset. You go out there and do your best. Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:27:46       Yeah, that's a man is always just so much to learn. That's what I've been learning to. Um, get out of like every set is the same and like, this is my material and I've been at it for a little bit. But knowing how to shift my energy for like that, like you do want to be professional for that, those 10 people, but you're not going to do the same like yelling energy as if they were a hundred people. You're going to be a little more intimate. You know, you gotta make it more of a conversation and that's what I'm really learning to do now. Watching, um, I think for a lot of Comedians, but, um, that Garry Shandling documentary that still haven't seen yet seen it. Oh Man. I love sweater. He really helped me. What I'm about me and mindful about being in the moment. So I've been really, like whenever I write a set list now, cause I usually number it and it has like a couple of words, um, the first alley, right? Number one bullshit for as long as possible because I don't like, I don't want to just get into it. I want to, uh, you know, unless it's like I got 10 minutes and I have things I want to do, but for the most part I'm like, let me get in a moment. Let me look people in the eyes and see if I see something not necessarily going in and just Crowdwork and rip on people. But let me, um, let

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       me just go in and talk about my day for a second and then maybe that will segway into my set. And so it teaches me a new way to get into things. Uh, more conversational. Yeah. Again, you're very jazz. You got a lot of jazz and you Ron. That's cool. That's a good way to do it. Cause it always does feel abrupt when someone begins with a joke. Sometimes it works though. Like some people can do it, they would go on stage and they just hammer with a first joke and from there it's off to the races. Like the open up with a non sequitur like out of nowhere. I'm bang. Yeah. Jeff Ross is really good at like just changing the tempo in a room. Yes, yes, yes. He's great at it. On the off the cuff, you know, in the spur of the moment type shit.

Speaker 2:          01:29:44       Cause all those years of roasting and all those years of fucking with the crowd like and, and that show they're doing him in a towel or traveling and doing that bumping Mike show where they just, they just fuck around man. I mean it's crazy. They just get in front of those people that walk around all crazy about what really opens your mind about gain with this job can be where you could literally just travel what your friend and fuck around and sell out. Yeah. It's amazing. It's amazing. It's a crazy Gig, man. It's crazy gig. When you started out in Chicago, What Club were you at? Um, I didn't start in Chicago. I was a ta. I was the,

Speaker 3:          01:30:20       a young man I left when I was 13 cousins. Um, my mom was in like, she's in a little negative relationship, so I went to go live with my dad in Oregon, um, and he was also a negative thing. So, and then, um, I started comedy in Portland, Oregon when I was 23, uh, um, Harvey's comedy club there. Ah, and um, and then doing some shows in Salem, eh, there's Chinese food restaurant called lucky fortune. And then, then I just started some shows there and you know, struggle for Oh, a long time. And then, um, think about five, five year, then I got asked to do Kona in and then was new phase and then got divorced and then it was like, all right, I'm moved, uh, moved to Los Angeles. And, um, no, just I have my son here and she has been me and him and now my girlfriend and my mom now lives with me in the last year. But um, yeah, that's pretty much it.

Speaker 2:          01:31:22       That sounds cool. Is there a scene in Portland? We started when I started it. It was pretty much like there, there had been, um, Seattle has a scene. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:31:32       There been a bit of a, um, like an LG scene of like an enough familiar with like Dwight Slade and shows rice. Um, and then not really much. There's just a lot based off of road gigs tripling. Ryan's going to Idaho.

Speaker 2:          01:31:46       That's right. Everybody was talking about those trivial runs. We had something similar, which is not as exciting because you guys were going through the wild west. I mean, you're going to Montana and Idaho. Oh, not me, not me. But the people

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       that did it, the people who did it. Yeah. I was, um, didn't seem lucky at the time, but it turned out in hindsight to be very lucky that the one time that that booker saw me, I just a share hardcore. And so nothing to do with me. And it turned out to be the best thing because then I was in this position where I was like, oh, okay, well I'm not gonna get Idaho's shows so I don't have to pander to that type of audience and I'm just going to be here. And so I can right now is really just like, oh, just write what you like. And that turned out to be the, um, the best thing for me.

Speaker 2:          01:32:36       Dude. You could perform in Boise. They would love you. Oh, I, I've ended up, I've had no, I love Boise is like Portland and it's a very unusual place. Almost like, I hate talking about it. I don't want to give out their spot now. They got good little comedy. Same building over there. Yeah, there's, well I think because of the Internet, there's a comedy scene almost any and every city people will find a way to get together and do something. It's just, it seems like too much of an exciting option for people who are fuck ups and there are so many of us, there's so many of us, you know, in one way or another, there's so many, you know, one, one form of fuck up or another. There's so many of us.

Speaker 1:          01:33:14       Yeah, that's true. I mean, I don't know if that's necessarily the true for the way that is set up for us to go. Um, the structure that is now just doesn't work as much anymore. It made more sense in the past, you know? Um, and also it is and shown and not be sound because that's the thing that trips me out now. It's like when I was a kid that was drilled in my head from my mom was good, a good government job, get a good government job, and now that seems like the most unsteady job you could have, you know, that just cut your department. Yeah. You never know. Yeah. And so one thing I learned, um, the standup taught me quickly was that it's the same stress, you know, but now I'm in charge. That stress of paying my bills. The stress of taking care of my son is the same whether I'm working for somebody else or I'm working for myself, but at least when I'm working for myself, I'm in charge. Right. You know, and as long as I have a product that I can pull it out. If I'm, if I don't have anything, then I guess I got to go work for somebody. But if I had something, I'd rather have that stress be put on me then have someone to show up one day and be like, we're out of business. Fine. Find someplace else to work.

Speaker 2:          01:34:26       Yeah. And you're 60 yeah. Yeah. And they just cut your whole department. Well didn't, I mean every fucking single politician gets in the office, they want to cut certain departments. Right. There's always someone that thinks something's being overfunded and yeah. That they're just talking about cutting social security and food stamps. And I was like, that seems like the last thing we need right now. Yeah. If you can make things, it seems like if you could make things, this is like one of the a good time to be on your own because you could sell things on the Internet. You could sell things in a way that no one could ever sell before. Like you could set up an online store, you don't have to have a physical location and you could just, you know, if you make something, if you're an artist, if you're a, you make pottery or some shit, you could sell things that you create online.

Speaker 2:          01:35:17       Like it's pretty easy to do now. Like this is a place where people can actually like, oh well if I just did this, if I figured out a way to do that, I'm working for myself. Or You just do it whenever I want to sell things. People like it, they put it in their house and then a lot of people can go in that direction. It's not. I mean, there's people that just aren't creative and they're not interested in it, but there's a lot of people are, and for those people who are just have a little bit of creativity that they maybe never really nurtured because he will work too much. Find a way, find a way, find a way to get through with that main plus. You know who you are because you, if you,

Speaker 1:          01:35:53       if your content and how your job has gone anyway, you're fine. You know you're not even thinking about that, but if you're upset and you're like, oh, I hate this job. I hate what's going on my life, you know that that usually

Speaker 2:          01:36:03       that might be the case and people love to say that's easy for you to say. It's easy. It's easy for you to say you guys are both already successful. It's very hard to get started. I get it. I get it. It is hard. It is 100% I get it, but don't think like that. Just try to find a way through. The more time you spend thinking on it, that's easy for you. I know. It's hard for me. The more time you do that, the less time you're thinking of an actual solution. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:36:27       You see the, I see that all the time. Especially even like with my weight loss and stuff, people um, there are like, oh you could say that you got, you got to train her. And it's just like I still had, I still had the be the guy that vomited. True. You know, I still had to be the guy that worked myself so hard that I threw up and still win

Speaker 2:          01:36:45       back. You know, it's like on the ground or did you make it to a trash can? The trash can. Not at wrestling. At wrestling. I as an on the ground. Oh No.

Speaker 1:          01:36:55       Yeah, cause then they made me clean it up and I'm like, it's part of the Gig. Yeah, it really was.

Speaker 2:          01:37:01       He can't be puking. [inaudible] yeah man. If you're working out to the point of puking, that's intense.

Speaker 1:          01:37:07       Well, you know, when my body was coming from places such an activity.

Speaker 2:          01:37:11       Yeah. How long do you think it took you for you to adjust to a constant state of activity? Probably like six months. That's a great thing though, that you had the discipline to do that. That's a great thing. It really is. It's, um, it's an underappreciated thing cause it's, I think it's easy for me to keep doing what I'm doing. I always do it. It's part of my natural way of doing it, but to not exercise and then decide you're going to clean your diet up and you're going to start exercising and you're going to continually do it even though you're exhausted because your body's not really prepared for this. So you must have had a long period of like, uh, for a couple of weeks at least, what you're like having your body try to respond to this, where it didn't have to do this before and now you're making it stress out all the time and it's got to recover and then you stress it out and it's kind of recover. And then

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       he bought, he's like, what the fuck dude? What is happening here? Is this our new life? Yeah. Yeah. No, that was pretty much that. You can you, and you nailed it. How long did it take, um, to lose, to get to where I am now? The to where you started feeling comfortable with like normal exercise on a regular basis or extreme strenuous exercise, strenuous exercising again, I think it'd be about, about, about six months of where I um, and then also just their weight goals. You know, I was about three 60 when we started it. And then, um, get an under three 50 was just like a real difference. And then when I got into 300, that was a big deal. And then when I got under two 50, um, and then now like now I'm about to 20 and anytime I go over to 25, I can feel it in my knees again.

Speaker 1:          01:38:46       And um, cause I had to take a little break for a few weeks and um, but now and that was really big on my mind because I was like, oh, I have to take a break for three weeks. Am I going to just blow up again? You know, and going through that and seeing that I can keep my diet and keep my nutrition and that I got a little less defined but I wasn't, I didn't blow up and I was like, okay that made me relax a little bit more and it's helped me as far as my comedy or dealing with executives and stuff or I am very much like, oh I needed that. Like I can, I can figure things out, I can do it. I have the discipline. If I really set my mind to something I can usually do it. Yeah, that's a, it's a giant accomplishment and people undermine it because um, they feel like it doesn't mean as much because you let yourself get to that weight. And I think it's a silly way of looking at it because

Speaker 4:          01:39:46       I am a firm believer that many of us who are feeling really good about life and having a great time here are v very, very lucky in their circumstance. Very lucky in, in, in the people you're around, the positive influences in your life, the good things, very lucky cause shit can be really not good. And when things are really not good and people go down the spiral, whether it's with booze and cigarettes and heroin or whether it's with food or whether it's with alcohol or whether it's whatever, the pills, if you can go down a spiral, it's who out of the person that is in the bottom of the spiral who can pull themselves out. Could you, if you had to start from there instead of starting from a place of success, and this is why I think people get cocky. You wake up every morning like, oh, I guess everything's okay.

Speaker 4:          01:40:37       You know, my life's not in the shitter. Instead think of what it would be like if you woke up and you were 380 pounds and this is your new life. Your new life is you got to get down from 380 pounds to about 220 pounds. You got to figure out how to do and you've got to figure out how to not lapse. When you're aching with hunger, you've got to figure out how how your your, your body has no fucking energy. It doesn't know how to recover. It never gets pushed and you have to push it through that and you have to do that to the tune of 160 pounds. A lot of fucking weight, man, that's a lot of fucking weight. Most people are not going to be able to do that. It's a lot of weight to lose. How long did that take you?

Speaker 1:          01:41:19       Um, about two and a half years. That's a, no matter what, that's an accomplishment, man. You know? And it's something that I think that when people hear that, that you did, that people realize like, I can do that too. I can do that. That can be done. Yeah. That's been one of the best things about it. And what it actually keeps me on it is when I get people reaching out to me. Like when I post pictures from the past or, and now and they're like, man, like, you know, in some ways the use of piss me out because if people are being like, Oh, if you can do it then I can definitely do it. But now it's like, it's very motivating.

Speaker 4:          01:42:01       Yeah. It's, you're setting an example, you know, you, um, you, you do something and then people, because you're in the public eye and he'd do this thing. They see you do it there, watch it happen. You know? I mean, it's one of the cooler things about it. Like you go in real time, he could see you two years ago. You could see you now. I mean, it's crazy. You want, you really did it, you know? And when people see that they, and the, it's not like if you heard that a guy lost 400 pounds who are like, wow, that's amazing. But if you see a guy and you watch them on a regular basis and he's 400 pounds and then all of a sudden he loses all that way. You like what? Look at him. Watch him do it. You see him do it. Something about people needing to see shit.

Speaker 4:          01:42:48       Like we need to see someone else do it. And then we can go, I can do that. You know? Yeah. Would you ever even imagine if you didn't know the people ran marathons, ultra marathons, would you ever even imagine that you would want to just run a hundred miles? No. You'd be like, what the fuck are you talking about? No one's doing that. But then you hear about it and you see it and he'd go, oh, I still don't want to do. He still don't want to do it. But it changes your idea of what people do. Yeah. Oh yeah. Oh, what's capable? Right. So when a guy like you lose all that way, it changes people's idea of what if they may be identify with you a change of their idea about what they're capable of. They changed their, their opinion of those themselves based on you pulling your life together in an awesome way publicly. Nice. Thank you dude. That's dope. That's, that has a powerful impact on people. You know, this academy, a lot of dudes out there and gals that are trying to figure the fuck out of the hole. They themselves in, you know, they're like, how did I get out of this? Like, how do I, Jesus Christ. I hate being tired all the time.

Speaker 1:          01:43:58       No, that's why my, um, that's one of the things I love my top, I'll allow my park has, is, and I try it cause people don't know me, you know, and that time on Twitter, if I'm like if I try to give a visor things or I'm not even really advised, just try and be positive. People go thank you. Talking about like what do you know, what do you care? You run on a TV show and I have to go like you don't know my history. You don't know where I came from. You don't know that I'm like I'm a single dad of this kid with a disability. I take care of them myself. I was boring as crap. I had had three weeks of a college community college education and I had once I like, it was like, oh, I got to pull my life together for this son who is different from other people and I don't know if he's ever going to be able to live on his own or are have his own job or I have to prepare for not, I had to prepare that if he does, if he needs help.

Speaker 1:          01:44:52       I had a pair of payer for all of these things and it really motivated me and it pushed me forward. And I like to, um, now for some reason I, I dunno if it's like survivor's remorse or whatever, I'm always like, man, I feel like so many people can do that, you know, not necessarily comedy or whatever, but I always feel like people have their own gifts, they have their own talents and sometimes we're not told that we're not pushed in. Those directions are sometimes where we, we go through traumas or things in our lives that damn our light, you know, and I like to be like, you. Anybody can do it because I'm a testament to that because I should not be here.

Speaker 4:          01:45:32       Well you, you should because you chose the right path. This is what's really critical about this kind of what, when we, you know, we talk about people's future or what they can and can't do. One of the beautiful things about standup is that it's a meritocracy. You're really funny. People love you. You're not like, that's, we just want to know you funny. Hey, is that guy funny? He's funny. Come on in. Is she funny? She's funny. Okay, come on in. We'll just, that's it. And I don't know of that many other jobs where it's that clear. There's a lot of jobs we got to do. All I ask is that you got to suck that corporate dick. You got to be in the office with Satan going, what the fuck am I doing with my life? I don't want to be here. You know, I'm writing down goals.

Speaker 4:          01:46:15       I just want to do coke. I want to get a Ferrari. Fuck this job. You know? That's what a lot of it is, man. There's a lot of like weird adjuncts, you know, and then you get stuck in this fucking corporate ladder. You get muted, you get toned down. There's no, there's no deviation from the standard office worker path. You know, you're in this weird groove, whereas it is the stand up. All you gotta do is make the people laugh. All you gotta do is find this shit. It's funny. Work on it makes people laugh. Get out there, get out there, boom, boom, boom. Oh Shit. You got to go see Ron Funches. Oh Shit. People start talking. People start telling other friends. The next thing you go,

Speaker 2:          01:46:50       there's agents, there's managers. You keep going, you keep going and keep getting better. Oh my God, you're on TV. Look at you. Keep going, keep going, keep going. If you just keep going and working at it like nobody tells us what to do, it's fucking beautiful, but not everybody can get that Gig. So then there's other gigs like what Gig do you take? It seems like you should take the gig where you make a lot of money, but that's not the move. It's not the move and less you can, your can be sure that you can quit that Gig in a short period of time because nobody ever does.

Speaker 1:          01:47:18       Yeah. Right. Trap jobs allow is, we'll put them and they had a lot of them were at, where I grew up with is, is this bank call center where I was working, um, because it was the only place, this tiny town, not many jobs like unless you were, if you didn't have a college education you were working at, at subway, you work in a Sam goody are, are you a working at this bank and you were making like 20 bucks an hour. You're making like double what you're making at the subway. But

Speaker 2:          01:47:43       dude

Speaker 1:          01:47:44       skills that transfer. So if you want to leave this job, you got you going back to the subway and you know, so there's a lot of people end up trapped there. And I knew right away I was like, I gotta get out. I can't, I mean, Hey, I'm not a bank die. Uh, so you know, that's a trap

Speaker 2:          01:48:01       trap man. I remember when I was a kid, I was working at this place called Newport creamery. It was an ice cream store. Like w they sold ice cream and hamburgers and shit like that and there was a bank that was like right next door. I would always go in the bank with my Newport creamery check and I deposit it and I'd say, hi, this lady. And then one day I heard, uh, she had the baby in the toilet and then left it in a garbage bin and no one even knew she was pregnant. And it was one of those like what? Like we had just a window into madness like right next door to where we were working. We were like, what? That lady that we always said hi to and the lady got pregnant, didn't tell anybody and gave birth in the bathroom at work and put the baby in a dumpster.

Speaker 2:          01:48:54       Dude, I wish you hadn't led with this with a bank story was a bank story and it was just a person person working. She could, if she could have been at a cupcake shop, it was just, this was a person, this is a person who was mad. There were crazy person. Right. You have to be, you'd would have to be a crazy version where no one knows you're pregnant and then you give birth in a bathroom and the baby winds up in a dumpster. It's like, that is, that's the most insane shit I've ever heard in my life. Yeah. And that was like right next door to the ice cream place. And we were all like, whoa. It's like the fabric, the fabric of reality had rippled. We realize like someone can be that crazy in your town, in your fucking town right there.

Speaker 1:          01:49:36       Hi De your town. Oh Man. You sound like a nice town. No,

Speaker 2:          01:49:39       it was a nice towel. It what I mean, it was a very idealic

Speaker 1:          01:49:45       pretty sheltered up until people put in babies and things.

Speaker 2:          01:49:49       Well, just, it was a, it wasn't a big place, you know. And, um, when something would go wrong, it would be odd. You know, like, you knew the person

Speaker 1:          01:49:59       I know it's shelter is because you were worked at a place called creamery Newport creamery ice cream for shelter. Yeah. That was a sheltered ASP. Beautiful. I want him to do that. I want to make that a reality from my,

Speaker 2:          01:50:16       no, it was a nice place to grow up. Um, and I had lived in Jamaica plain before that, which was much, uh, much worse neighborhood. It was sketchy. We lived there for about a year and then my parents were like, we gotta get the Fuck Outta here. Like people breaking into cars and while you're sleeping and how home break ins. And it was just a lot of crime, especially in like 1978 or whatever the fuck it was. I guess it was like Haiti. Yeah. So then we moved to Newton, which is nice. Are Your parents still around? Yeah. Yeah. They're still together. My step, my stepdad and my mom are still together. They've been together since I was a little kid. They're a nice couple. Okay. Have a good time together. Yeah, I uh, you know, do you ever wonder what you're going to be like when you like 75 year old man?

Speaker 1:          01:51:04       Yeah. What do you think that'd be cool as fuck. Cause I mean I don't, I don't give a fuck mostly now and imagine later. Right. Even less just saying all types of stuff. I see it in my mom, you know, my mom especially is fine because I can take her to like random events that I go to and she just, I try to be cool, you know, cause I'm working and she has none of that cause she doesn't care. Like my mom's sexually harass Justin Timberlake. It was great. It was, security was about to take her out. She just doesn't care. Have you ever had our guests on your podcast? Yeah. Yeah. She was the second guess or the first or second episode? Yeah. It's always, yeah. My Mom's, yeah. I learn a lot from my mom and she's super dope. And now she's um, smoking a lot of pot and just, she lived down.

Speaker 1:          01:51:57       Oh, she lives with you now? Yeah. She lives in the Pool House and hangs out. Did you get depressed and in Portland with the weather did freak out. Yeah. You did seasonal depression there. Yeah. Easily. Yeah. People say it's real. They say even if you take vitamin D and sit in a tanning bed, yeah. I mean they'll show you those lights and all those things, but she doesn't do it though, does it? No, not when you're dealing with three months of straight gray. It's the rain, not just gray. Oh, because there's this lack of color palette in your life. Yes.

Speaker 2:          01:52:29       You don't get the vibrance. Yeah. Yeah. When the ocean looks like a d a dull gray.

Speaker 1:          01:52:35       Yeah. Even the ocean looks tired like oh right. As opposed to like if you go to

Speaker 2:          01:52:42       Mexico, like, uh, I went to Cancun way back in the day and the first thing I noticed like how the fuck is the ocean? That color? Like, look how pretty it is. Yeah. It's like all bluish green. That's gorgeous. Yeah. If you ever been to the French Riviera, no. Oh my God. You want a time when and yeah, same thing. They have a pebble beaches, the sand, which is a horrible, but, but the water is so beautiful. It's crazy. Yeah. I grew up, um, in that town, which was next to the Charles River and the Charles River went all the way through Boston. And the Charles River was like disgusting man. Like you'd, you see condoms floating in it and you'd see I saw one pipe and this bubbles were coming up to the surface. I was like, what the fuck is that? And then I saw a condom bubble up and I went, oh my God, it's a sewer pipe.

Speaker 2:          01:53:35       And I realized someone was just flushing their shit and piss right into the Goddamn river. Oh, like how did this happen? And I was, you know, 14 and I'm like, what the fuck is this? Like how the, how am I finding this? Like you don't have anybody likes checking to see if the shit pipe is right into the Goddamn river. Like, oh my God, it was crazy. So it wasn't clean by any stretch of the imagination. So to see that kind of a clean, pure like ocean water where like you were a heard a bone fishing. Do you know what that is? It's a type of fishing that people do. It's, I think they mostly just catch and release them. I don't think they even keep most of them, but they go to Florida and I the, I think The Bahamas wants to The Bahamas and they are on these like special boats that are like, uh, these uh, boats you can stand on and their fly fishing for this fish that looks like it belongs in the stone age.

Speaker 2:          01:54:31       It's weird, cool looking fish called the bonefish. See if he could pull up a picture of it. I don't know why we're talking about this. That's how high am, that's what the law, that's cool. Is that a bonefish smoke small like a Barracuda? That's a bonefish. See that's a bone first. That other one was a barracuda. I think they just had a bad photo. You see the difference? Like it's, it's a crazy look in Fishman and see that water behind them. It's hard to tell from this image, but what we're looking as really shallow water like at the most it's like three feet deep, right? And they're just casting out and they see these fish coming towards them and they catch it. It's supposed to be like super, super exciting. You do love fishing. I don't do a lot of fishing but I love fishing.

Speaker 2:          01:55:12       It's fun. But this is fun. Like I would assume, I've haven't done this kind of fishing bone fishing, but that's what people, people love. Like seeing a fish coming and going and biting your lore like it's very exciting. Yeah. It's sad to say, but look how clear that goddamn water is. It was no clue. There's no condoms. She says bonefish. I was watching a video today of a guy jumping with scuba gear on into the garbage patch. It's the middle of the Pacific Ocean. You know? I had knew, I knew that it is supposed to be like horrific, but once you, when you see it in a video, you're watching just go, what the fuck is this? This guy put scuba gear on and jumped into this. I mean is it was plastic, you couldn't see anything but plastic everywhere you look to the left and the right, it was all plastic. Like this is huge. Like several states, large. Yeah. This shit,

Speaker 2:          01:56:07       this is what humans are doing to the ocean. This is, this is a, would you see them jump in and it's almost, did they show him jump in or is this a different video is different. There's a different video cause the other one, the guy starts out on the boat and, and dives in and what he dives into is just like plastic soup. It's fucking disgusting man. It's crazy. Yeah. Like this. Um, so there's this guy that we had on the podcast name is boy on slot and he created a device that he's using to try to pull the plastic out of the ocean and they'll maybe convert that plastic and to know things that we can use. And um, there, I don't think it worked on the first attempt, but they're, they're relaunching it, right? Didn't he? They had to do something to fix things there.

Speaker 2:          01:56:55       You know, it's still in like sort of the prototype stage. But he's going to have these machines. There's giant net move around through the ocean and catch all these plastic yeah. Bay from getting fish. That's a very good question. I don't think there's any fish living in there. Um, I bet a lot of fish have eaten that stuff though. Guaranteed. This is probably a lot of fish with plastic in their stomachs. Oh, a hundred percent. Yeah man, that's gross. I mean what, what kind of shit gets in their system and then when you eat that fish, what kind of shit are you getting in your system? How many people were testing their fish? You know, I mean how many people are, uh, before they eat a Sam and they're like, hold on, let me check for mercury and let me see what, how much arsenics in this.

Speaker 2:          01:57:38       So we kind of heavy metal party. What sets up bpps that they're worried about the come from? What does the stuff they're worried about? The comes from bottles. Plastic? Yeah. [inaudible] or something like that. I wish I knew what that meant. Guess they did, they did their first results from November. I don't know what he's saying. Oh, so this is their first, uh, their first actual pulling of the garbage, you know, listen man, even if it takes 10 years, if they could figure out a way to, to get rid of all that plastic and we could figure out a way to not put that plastic in the ocean and we can, maybe, what I really worry about almost as much as this maybe even more, is overfishing.

Speaker 2:          01:58:20       When you realize how many different ships are out there using giant nets and just scooping everything they catch inside that net and then just serving it to us and we were like, who you want to get Sushi? Yeah, Sushi sounds good. You know, we're like so close. He's just sounds good. It's ocean genocide. I mean it's fucking chaotic. Man. Did they don't have real, I mean they don't have real control. It's international waters. People were just cut and nets and dropping them to the bottom of the ocean and the catching things all the time. There's nets all over the place out there. He would just release their nets. They just litter.

Speaker 1:          01:58:54       But you're always, you've been very conscious about like what you eat and like sustainability a lot lately, right?

Speaker 2:          01:59:01       Well I think sustainability. Yeah, I do think about that a lot. Um, I don't know if I'm that conscious of it. I'm definitely guilty of not being sometimes hungry dream the unconscious about it. I wish I was more conscious back cause I'm putting my faith. It makes me all sad. Yeah. I'm more, I'm more conscious about what I eat and I am uh, sustainability in terms of like the quality of what I eat. I'm more conscious about that. I should be more conscious about sustainability, but sometimes it feels like, what does this, what are you showing me here? Is that a crocodile? God Damn it. What is a big, big

Speaker 1:          01:59:31       catch with an exclamation mark is the name of the fish guy. 40 million views on youtube. It's a net that's full of stuff.

Speaker 2:          01:59:38       Oh, they caught a net. Oh, this is, oh, a net, right. This is a fishing boat. Yeah. Oh Jesus. Yeah. Look at that. Look how it works. They just scoop up every fucking thing that's in that ocean. It's really amazing that they fee. I mean, what a horrific place to be. If you're a fish, imagine if fish, we're like super smart and this is their demise. I mean this is an insane net filled with living creatures that were going to eat. Not Bro. It's just tilapia. Relax. God, you're kidding. So dramatic. Look at that. That's a crazy bundle of these ocean creatures. And how often does this happen? A day. Is it all day? I bet it is. I bet this is all day. I bet this is all day for years and years and years and years. And I don't think they take time off. I think they keep going and if they're not, they're someone else's there too. And I think this is happening. As long as they can make money selling fish and we're willing to buy fish. It's kind of insane.

Speaker 1:          02:00:43       You think people ever feel bad about it? If any of those people feel bad, maybe it's

Speaker 2:          02:00:48       possible. They're not monsters, right? If they're, they might develop, uh Oh, that guy just stepped right on a fish though. Yeah, they get desensitized. I'm sure. Man. Anything like he cared. Oh well this is crazy. I mean, this is not a person's supposed to be able to catch a fish or a two fish or three fish and then you eat it. Like this is chaos, man. This is some crazy thing where you have to make filet of fish sandwiches because there's, you know, 320 million people and a hundred of them, 100 million of, we want junk food anytime they want it. I mean, I don't know if that went to filet a fish or if that's a expensive fish. I really have no idea. I'm just talking shit. Don't listen to me. But, and I also eat fish, so I'm a hypocrite. But it is kind of crazy when you watch this video and I'm not, you know, I, uh, I'm not opposed to eating fish, but I'm just saying the reality of what this is is, is crazy.

Speaker 2:          02:01:39       This is a crazy scene and to not deny it's a crazy scene. I'm still going to eat fish and I feel, I feel awful about this. It does slightly make me want Sushi. I looking at this, it's crazy. When I was a server, like a big question question. People always ask us at farm raised or is it wild caught and like this is wild caught versus farmers. I don't know why it would make a giant difference. It just seems like bad either way tell no matter what for these organisms, but they're delicious and they're really good for you.

Speaker 2:          02:02:11       But how, how are they going to ensure that there's gonna be some left? That's what's crazy. Like the, the human governments need to get together and go, hey, we can't kill the whole ocean because that is possible if you keep going at the pace that it's going now, if you really stop and think about what the ocean must have been like when you hear about those, uh, Japanese tuna fishermen, like did you see Jiro Dreams of Sushi? Remember when those gentlemen were at the fish market and they were talking about what it used to be like, I used to be tuna everywhere, so much tuna. Now it's like a small amount and you got to check to see if it's good. Like they're watching it happening in real time. If you go from that point where that guy was talking about today and then go 50 years from now at the same pace, like, yeah, now you gotta be, but it seems like that it wouldn't be that hard to be more conscious about it.

Speaker 2:          02:03:02       Well, it the very least, they have to take into consideration the fact that, uh, they need to maybe develop some sort of an international program to breed these things, you know, to, to, to like they, they've done that with yellow tail, the, they have these like a ocean sort of almost like a, like corralled in area and they're out in the ocean, but they're only in this one trapped area and they're feeding them, you know, and occasionally they'd get out, like they get those yellow tails in Hawaii, there was a storm and the storm wreck their little enclosure and they got out and now they're everywhere. So all these, uh, Hamachi grade, like Sushi grade, yellow tails are swimming around all over the place and they're breeding, they getting bigger. Yes. It's crazy. It's interesting. But, but I was thinking when they were telling me that, well, so if that's what they did, like maybe they should do that and just keep releasing him.

Speaker 2:          02:03:51       Maybe we should be a program that all the people who buy Sushi Fund into that just takes a little piece of the Sushi money and uses it to develop these programs to make sure that these fucking fish keep reading so you can have more Sushi. I think people would pay extra for that shit. Right. Then they lady, then they would feel good helping out. Yeah. That's what I think we can leave this next, next, next, next generation ever. Real good possibility of like making things work out better. I really think that like it's totally possible. I think it's possible that the world's just going to keep bad at getting better and better and there's going to be terrible things, but it's going to keep getting better and better and then we'll be able to come to some kind of time in our future worth. Seems like things have improved.

Speaker 1:          02:04:38       I agree with you. I think we're headed towards a, a job, a new golden era, new enlightenment because, and I think a lot of times these, um, things that we think are negative or are kind of indicators of that because these are things, a lot of these negative things we talk about were happening either way, but now we're more aware of them and people fight them and people, um, are more upset about them and they're more public because of things with social, like social media. And I think that's a positive, not a negative that people aren't able to pull the wool over your eyes as easily.

Speaker 4:          02:05:12       Yeah. I think what's really interesting about this time was that you got so many people that are able to communicate, um, whether it's yourself or Joey Diaz or Ari Shaffir or Mark Marin or whoever these people are that have these podcasts. So many people have this ability to communicate. So many people have this ability to, you know, you show the life, you let you show your world and like a different way. And everybody gets to compare all these different ways that people are communicating. And we could kind of like come to maybe a better understanding of why we think the way we think and which I think, especially one of the reasons why I'm so hell bent on having people be reasonable and tried to talk to each other so that I think that everybody could learn something from each other in this world, whether you're left or right or in the center or religious or atheist or whatever, there's too many, too much conflict. It's unnecessary. There's too much of what people are, aren't, that has nothing to do with you. And you should be able to talk about politics or even religion and be completely calm about it and not be angry and not get emotional and child life. But we're programmed to think you're supposed to. We're programmed to think that every fucking conversation about something you disagree with is supposed to be this angry battle of, of oneupsmanship. And I don't think it has to be, I don't think it does.

Speaker 1:          02:06:35       No. I mean, um, there's certain issues that like where you're like, oh, I don't want to argue over my, like civil rights or things like that. You know, you're like, yeah, I don't want to be like, oh, okay, well you, you do, you don't think I'm a full person. Okay, let's have a point. Counterpoint. There's issues like that. But I think now so many things get wrapped up in politics that people do forget to be civilized and do forget that we've always disagreed and we've always had different sides and that's what made us a country, you know, as the fact that we were the take the, like you said, the mix of those conversations and that's the way that we kind of head in. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:07:18       So where we find out who we really are as opposed to who our side is, painting the other side as you know. And I feel like, um, what I meant by people like being able to get along is you can have opposing thoughts and still be a nice person. I want, if you're like a really super conservative person, like sometimes I want to know why. Like I don't want to oppose you as much as I want to know why. I want to know what you're thinking. Like, what, what is, what's pushing you in this direction? What makes you think this as opposed to if you are really progressive person, what makes you think this? Like what's going on like that that conversation can be had in a way more peaceful way? Well, maybe we could all examine why we think about things a certain way.

Speaker 4:          02:08:05       And I've been thinking about a lot when it comes to religions lately. This, we're so fucking tense about religions, so fucking tense lately. And if it's not for like kids getting abused or wars getting started over it, the vast majority of it is just a guideline for people to live their life. And if you take that away from them or tell them, then that's bad for them. I tell them they can't live that way then then you've created this conflict that's really not your business. Right. And a lot of ways, yeah, I didn't think like that before. I used to think before that, like, that's not what I believe. So you know, these people, there must be something wrong with the way they're thinking.

Speaker 1:          02:08:41       Mm. Well, that's a lot of times that's what, um, certain organized religions painted as, right? Like if you aren't believe, if you don't believe in that, even you can have same branch of Christianity or whatever, but it's like, Oh, if you're not Protestant, sure you know this, then you're not falling it completely. Or, and to me it was always so many of these rules ended up just being like, hey, be a nice person. Yeah, don't, don't be a jerk. Don't murder people that, you know, in there, those are kind of costs. And through all of those things where you're like, that's something I can take from you, but to judge someone else's life based off of their, their sexual orientation or something, a, of anything that, that to me never dies, you know? Right. So I'm always like, I'm open to whatever you want, whatever makes you not be a fucking jerk. I'm four.

Speaker 4:          02:09:33       Yeah, no, I'm with you 100%. I remember the first time I found out there was other religions, like I want to, I was raised a Catholic when I was a little kid and I've found out there was other things other than being a Catholic. And I was like, what are you talking about? So if there's other things, cause uh, my uncle was converting to Judaism and so I was like, what does that mean? Oh, he's going to become Jewish. Like what does that mean? Like what are you talking about? I was like, you know, five or something like that. I was like, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. You can shit. There's different ones. Like what do they think? Like who's right. I remember being like six years old going, shit, there's more than one story that you have to follow. We're not sure who's right. And my uncle is going to switch over to the other story. Now he believes a different story. I can't believe this. He's got an adjusted story and you know, you fall into this pattern, now you're in this, this story's pattern. Like, wow. You know, we lost him to the Marvel Universe, DC comics for so long. He was all about Batman and Superman and now he's like, fuck them. I'm with the Avengers.

Speaker 2:          02:10:35       Crazy as a phone way look at it. It's an interesting way of looking at it without being disrespectful to either side. It's like, wow, okay. You know, I don't know who's right. We know who makes better movies. Yes. Yeah. The choose do an excellent job making movies. It's amazing how much they've been involved in show business. You know, when I'm watching that marvelous Mrs Maizel then make sure a realize like, oh yeah, Lenny Bruce is Jewish. This guy was Jewish doc. I was Jewish. There were so many Jewish guys in the early days of stand up. Yeah. Got a little mafia, you know, the same time, there was a lot of Jewish boxers back then too. So thing that people probably don't know it was, they were a underclass and a lot of ways or you know, um, and like, that's like now it's Russians. Like you get a lot of Russian boxers now. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          02:11:22       ass, motherfucking Russians. Tude hard men, hard man, because they're, they're coming over here from a hard place and they're fucking people up, you know? And it's like one day it'll be someone else. It's, it's, it's interesting how it goes in these waves, you know? Yeah. But whatever country is not doing well. Yeah. And it's interesting when you see the waves of standups come out of these countries too, you know, like, like there's different styles of standup now in different parts of the world. You know, standup is really a global thing now. Like legitimate, like an English guys have their own style. You know, there's a lot of those guys, like, I've never been to Edinburgh, but, um, Ari Shaffir goes all the time. He's like, dude, they have like, oh, they'll do these hours on just a subject. All the themes. Yeah, exactly. Different Vibe, different style, a lot less.

Speaker 2:          02:12:09       Um, rowdy Lollis I'm boisterous. Just people listening. They're great at listening. Uh, we did, um, uh, Sweden and, uh, we, we played Stockholm, me and Tony Hinchcliffe and Tony was like, dude, it's just like, they didn't like me. I going to know. They're just polite. I go in between the jokes. They're just quiet. They're listening, you're not used to that. And he's like, okay, okay. Okay. And he went out the second one, he was like, you're right, you're right. They just so nice that something was wrong. But it's, it's, I'll put it in for your timing cause it makes me to have to have more material because you're used to like waiting for a few seconds am great. Well it's also, you know, that's, it's, it's not, I don't think it's that common art form over there. I don't think they have a long history of having standup in Sweden do that.

Speaker 2:          02:13:00       Not that I'm aware of. I mean, maybe they do and we don't know. But for whatever it is, it's, it's diminutive in comparison to any of the places that we know. If they'd have scenes, whether it's New York scene, you know, La has seen San Francisco, there's like some big scenes here where, you know, funny guys who, and girls who've come out of these scenes, you don't hear like a lot of guys from Sweden, do you know? Yeah. But they're starting to get more of them. There's getting more of them. Everybody all around the world, they started getting more comedy. It's really, it's an interesting time and that way it's very similar to Jujitsu. You know, Jujitsu at one point in time there's only a few places you get it outside of Brazil. It was hard to find someone who's really good at teaching it and now it's everywhere. I was in New Zealand and Australia, it's an Africa, it's everywhere. There's Jujitsu, old Canada and fucking the Puerto Rico is Jujitsu everywhere. All over the world. Cuba, everyone has Jujitsu, you know, just spread it. Found out it was awesome. That could be the same with Stan

Speaker 1:          02:13:55       then in forms back into the practice, right, because there's everybody's doing new style

Speaker 2:          02:14:01       hundred percent and everyone is like, there's a really accelerated learning growth from the time where it starts getting put on the Internet, which is like around like 95 96 and the Internet kind of becomes alive from that point on. People comparing Jujitsu techniques and watching matches and then you know, new gyms opening up all around America in particular. It's like the whole level, the sport went through the roof. It's crazy.

Speaker 1:          02:14:25       Yeah. I think, yeah, I think that's very similar to comedy because I think a lot, um, my personal growth was I was able to do it because I was able to watch so much comedy and also I was able to get on the Internet and read about a lot of comedy and in Twitter and Youtube or Twitter was just starting in Youtube was going and I watch a lot of them watching the videos with you, would you invincea those things, you know, and a lot of that stuff, um, informed my comedy at an early, early age about like making a style or just how I wanted to write for myself. Because when you're, especially when you're first starting, a lot of what will work when you're first starting, we'll set you up for failure later as far as like pandering to people are riding for these rowdy rooms. There were bar rooms, you know, and, and those things don't work when you go to travel. And so if I didn't have like the internet or they always have these things too wise to go like, oh, don't worry about this time. Don't worry about this local scene as much because you don't want to be a local act, you know? And that was, that was very helpful for me. And that's it.

Speaker 2:          02:15:36       Yeah. No for me too, man. I know exactly what you're saying. Yeah. Well listen man, let's wrap this bitch up. Thank you for doing this.
