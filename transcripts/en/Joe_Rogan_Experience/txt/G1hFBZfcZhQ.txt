Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Is when they walk in. Alright. We are live. Ladies and gentlemen. The Joe Rogan experience podcast. Yes. Oops, that's me.

Speaker 2:          00:00:09       I'm the one that he has to turn off his phone. Oh, you have to turn off your volume, John, on your computer and your computer

Speaker 1:          00:00:16       computer and your computer. If you hear the delay. John, let's flip down the volume. So there we go. Okay. The Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by the flashlight. If you go to Joe Rogan.net, click on the link for the fleshlight and enter in the code name Rogan. You will save yourself 50 percent off the number one sex toys for men either. Yeah. Can you hear us? John John Speakers and he. John Anthony West is trying to figure out his phone.

Speaker 3:          00:00:46       Please.

Speaker 1:          00:00:48       Did we lose the skype connection?

Speaker 3:          00:00:51       Huh?

Speaker 1:          00:00:51       Did we lose a skype connection with him? Yeah, but he's not a. He doesn't hear us.

Speaker 4:          00:00:57       Hey. No one I.

Speaker 2:          00:01:04       something is. Yeah, he turns the volume off on his computer. Were you listening to us through your computer? Through your phone? You need to turn the volume off on ustream page. So there should be on the, if you're looking at Ustream, there should be a mute button on the actual video that you're watching. What I'm guessing is is that you are using a skype phone and so when you muted your computer it probably needs everything.

Speaker 1:          00:01:32       Oh, that makes sense. There you go. So sir, if you see the lower right hand corner of the video, we're under under the words Joe Rogan experience. The lower right hand corner is like a little volume icon. If you just killed that, that should fix everything. Corner low, lower, lower right hand corner of the window. The video window window. The video window is this thing that literally circling thing and there's the uh, there's like there should be a volume button on your left. Yes. The far left. Yes. Yeah. Just kill it and just turn off the volume. I did that. There you go. Beautiful. Hi, John Anthony West Egypt tologist genius, and doesn't, doesn't know too much about ustream. Very limited genius. We got one more commercial side and then we'll just get cracking. Our podcast is also brought to you by, I think we have a little delay as a bit of delay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:30       We're going to get this worked out. Our podcast is also brought to you by [inaudible] dot com. That's o n n I, t, makers of Alpha brain, new mood, shroom, tech sport, True Tech Immune, and we do have kettlebells coming very soon. Some people have already started ordering them because they've gotten to the website already, but we're getting all the details worked out as about shipping and things along that nature and the hemp powder. Hemp protein powder is coming out soon as well, so go check out all that on [inaudible] dot com. Use the code named Brogan. Save yourself 10 percent off. If you have any questions about any of this stuff, go to [inaudible] dot com and it will all be answered. All right, hit the music. Brian. We're going to start this bitch experience Joe Rogan podcast. This ladies and gentlemen is a very, very special edition of the Joe Rogan experience. First of all, because the first one we've ever done through skype and a two because it is with one of my personal heroes that I'm honored to get to talk to a man named John Anthony West. John is an egyptologist, uh, of, uh, you know, somebody on twitter had a very great comment about. You said that you're more of a proof reader for history. It's more, you're more than an egyptologist.

Speaker 5:          00:03:52       Okay. I'm done. School, depending on my audience, I sometimes call myself a rogue egyptologist,

Speaker 1:          00:03:58       a rogue egyptologist. And if you folks who aren't seeing online, if you're listening to this, only on Itunes, John has an office that is exactly what I would hope and pray his office would look like, just filled with documents and information and books. And it's crazy, man. Look at all that information behind you. You look like a mad scientist. You look like Alex Jones, this car. Yeah. You're, you're a mad scientist, sir.

Speaker 5:          00:04:24       People have called me that. Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:04:26       I first was turned onto your work by the NBC special on the Sphinx that was hosted by Charlton Heston, which was a very controversial thing that NBC aired right, and it was a special on the mysteries of the dating of the Sphinx and became absolutely fascinated by the compelling evidence that you and Dr. Schoch presented to all these traditional egyptologists that the rain erosion on this function closure had to have come from literally the seven or 8,000 years earlier than they were predated than they were dating this finks

Speaker 5:          00:05:07       yeah, probably more than that Gel and we'll get into that if we want to discuss it further, but that's the. That was the most conservative date. That shock as a, you know, as a bonafide phd geologist. He's sort of constrained to take the most conservative view, but even had doubts about it when he was saying it, but now he's, he's loosening up by a lot and it's basically on, on the same car as me. In other words, holding open the possibility that it may be as old as actually as $36,000 bc or even older. And the reason for that is not Santa sizing or anything of the sort of stuff. The Egyptians themselves in several in London, in a tablet, a stele coal, the Palermo stone because not because it has anything to do with land, but because that's where it is. And another virus, very fragmentary, called the turn for Paris, where the Egyptians themselves, ancient Egyptians talk about long periods prior to the beginning of what we call dynastic Egypt, Egypt, that begins around 3,500 BC where Egypt is room for thousands and thousands and thousands of years like the natural, which means the gods themselves, which actually means I take to mean enlightened or divinely enlightened human beings.

Speaker 5:          00:06:33       And then another long, long period where Egypt is ruled by the ship so far, which means the companions or the followers of forest and the retinal that the names of these kings are given and the dates of these kings are given them dope boats. The stone is damaged on the powers and somewhat fragmentary. If you compute the years, you end up with something like 36,000 BC, which in fact is not. There's not a casually chosen date because the Sphinx itself, as you know, the going to actually as we go along somewhere along the line to talk about this, because I can send you all kinds of interesting texts, illustrations where maybe you can on your end, I'm intersperse them into collate them into the actual video broadcast, I guess you'd call it so that viewers can see what we're talking about as we're talking about it. Anyway, if you can do that. Greg bootcamp.

Speaker 6:          00:07:33       Yeah, no, we can. We can definitely do that, but for the audio only people. This is a fascinating conversation either way with or without pictures. How did you get on this path? How did you.

Speaker 5:          00:07:44       It just. I'll tell you in two seconds, but first, let me just say the reason why the city $6,000 date is not as outrageous as it might sound is a because the Egyptians themselves are talking about that sort of date and also because the strengths with this lion's body and human head screams out as an astronomical astrological marker and the it's meant to commemorate the age of Leo. The last age of Leo is where the links in the relationship is that the Sphinx is cited so that it looks duties and so the last time the Sphinx looked at its own image in the sky before the sun rose. That's other. Talk about the processional ages. If you want to get into that, we can. It's not complex astronomy, but it's astronomy. Anyway. The last time the strengths looked at its own image in the sky, but at sunrise on the spring, Equinox would have been about 10,000, 10,500 BC.

Speaker 5:          00:08:44       There are good reasons why 10,500 BC is not satisfactory and the the the age before that, the age of Leo before that is another 26,000 deals earlier. It's the cycles, so called procession of the economic cycle takes 20 roughly 20, 26,000 years, so 36,000 years would have been another time when this links looked at its at its own image in the sky. I brought up the spring equinox, so there are reasons. I mean, as I said, it's, it's not just fantasizing, it's backed up, it's conjectural. Of course we can improve it as at the moment, but there are good reasons why it could be as old as that

Speaker 6:          00:09:30       conventional wisdom is that human civilization and the, you know, in the form of cities and such that, that didn't exist before 10,000 years ago. Right.

Speaker 5:          00:09:39       Well, it was conventional wisdom until very recently. It's one of the battles that we've had. We've had to fight. But you see long story, Shaka and I are writing a book. I'll tell you more about this as we go along, telling the story of this whole strength thing because we presented. This is a geological argument. Um, it's about the water, weathering to the sprinkle the weathering to the sex with shock as a geologist in the specialist in these things. It took a lot, a lot to get him on board. Mind you, this is a long. It's a big, long, funny story. I won't get into necessarily right now here though, since we have an open ended, we have an open end show and I have plenty of block in the freezer and we might go on for quite awhile. But anyway, the, the, the, the, the point is that it's a geological argument.

Speaker 5:          00:10:38       And when I got shocked on board, he took him awhile before he acknowledged that it had to be correct. I mean, he was putting scene for me to be a heretic is easy. I don't give a damn. I mean I don't like these people and I don't respect their intelligence or their integrity. So, and I have nothing to lose, you know, shock as a tenured associate professor of geology at Boston University. So he has, he puts his neck on the line. That means something eventually took a bit of dual. Anybody he did it. And then we presented this evidence first at the, at the, you might call it the super bowl geology. It's called the, um, the, the, the annual meeting of the Geological Society of America. This was in 1991. We were the stars of the show. I mean, they recognize the deal, logical society recognize that this was a dynamite presentation.

Speaker 5:          00:11:30       And so all the precedents, they have the science for us at the girls and so on. And it was that, that actually allowed us to get this thing passed secretary is it NBC and then put it out in prime time with sweeps week and the 1 million man it was nominated for best documentary of that year, etc. Etc. Etc. So it was that, that brought it to the florist, the crack academics to pay attention to it. And I'm, thE battle has been going on ever since. And actually funny story because I can say it here, but normally I can't. Then I'm on a, on a, on a normal reSpectable deliveries yet I've watched a couple of years shows I know I can get away with it here. And we, when we gave this presentation initially in 1991, the, the geologists were unanimously in favor of it. They came to our presentation, they walked to our display and they said, yeah, you know, I mean, how could anybody have the most as well as another bit of the story, but so.

Speaker 5:          00:12:38       But the egyptologist and the archaeologist absolutely incensed by the whole thing. And they were calling us all kinds of names and there was one woman who will go nameless here, but so coming up in a book somewhere. So who is a, an, an egyptologist at boston university was shocked potentials and oh yeah, I'm earlier. So we were being interviewed chunk and myself. I'm black, the world press really. And so this is 1991 and at one point we were being interviewed by the guy who was the science editor of the boston globe and shock teachers in boston. So it means a hometown boy. And so shop gave his, his interview and chalk is that we're good. We're a good duo. It's exactly good cop, bad cop, but no shockers, always civil and bill. Always professional and always polite. Really even when it shouldn't have to worry about these things. I can say whatever. Write down please. So I guess name the channel with the science editor of.

Speaker 7:          00:13:48       We should explain before we go any further, we should explain the argument for people that don't understand it. The, the water erosion argument. This is what people are trying to ignore. Um, there's, there's people that are still arguing that somehow or another that could have been created by sand and wind and that this erosion, um, according to most geologists, that's not the case. Most geologists are stating that it had to be water correctly.

Speaker 5:          00:14:15       That's correct. But now they've, now they've actually gone off the sand and wind thing and now it's supposed to be what's called salt crystallization in which the water water soaks through the limestone and creates chemical reactions with the rock and that weather is off and creates the weathering that we say. This is actually a nonsensical argument which we will be addressing very shortly. I'll take that

Speaker 7:          00:14:42       and there's an incredible amount of resistance to this idea. Even though the geological science there are, they in agreement on this,

Speaker 5:          00:14:51       almost most

Speaker 8:          00:14:52       of them. There were a few who aren't, and I'll get into this too as we go along. It saved the point. What's at stake here was not, this is not, this is not just a scholarly quibbled because for the strings to be watered, whether then specifically by rainwater means that it has to have been there when it was raining needs for you. See, there's almost no rain there now an inch or so a year, the sahara desert formed around 10,000. They sAy before ground was fertIle savannah, sort of like modern day kenyon, maybe even wetter than that. So for the swings to be weathered by, by, by rainwater means means that it has to have been there before, before or during the time that lots and lots of rain was swelling. Now what's at stake there? When you were saying before the civilization, according to the standard scenario, civilization begins around 3000, 3,500 bc, more or less simultaneously in Egypt in scenario in China and India, but all of it is around that day, but the strengths you see as really as the most spectacular sculpture on earth, it's 240 feet long and 66 feet high and it's a magnificent, absolutely breathtaking sculpture even in ruins and the temples around it, which we'll get into somewhere along the line, but ideally I'll send you pictures of it.

Speaker 8:          00:16:14       The temples around them are powerful stone limestone buildings faced with granted, but what's interesting about them is not the size of the templates themselves by egyptian standards metal that big, but the stones that they're better that comprise them weigh somewhere between 50 and 150 pounds each and the setup in such a way that slotted into places into place like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. We can't do that today. Do you still have the old, the charlton heston video? It's evident evidently have seen we have this guy jesse water and lose the project manager of when they're building a cogeneration plant out in long island and he's acknowledging he's fascinated by this because he says, yeah, our biggest cranes are biggest landing bags. PAins could lift these rocks, but we wouldn't know how to rig them so that we could get them into place. So this means is that not just at the snakes is fabulous. Statute is much, much older. It was built before this supposed to be any civilization at all, but it means that there's a technology in place that we, with our brilliant science, have produced hydrogen bombs and labile had donald's and nerve gas in mobile. These wonderful new developments. We couldn't build the temples around swings, so that's why they're all so incensed that absolutely. The whole idea is we. If this is finally acknowledged, that means that everything, that everything that these people have believed about ancient,

Speaker 5:          00:17:51       about the onset of human cIvilization is completely dead wrong. so that that's why. That's why there is angry as they are in the air force sent because a good line to the flack is always happiest when you're right over the target.

Speaker 6:          00:18:08       You know, one of the things I learned from watching your documentary is I really thought that scientists and people that were studying the history of something as important as Egypt that they would be. We'll just leave that sound on brian. Hey, I guess john, you have a fan going on in the background. Is that your computer fan?

Speaker 5:          00:18:24       Yeah. That's thing

Speaker 6:          00:18:28       anyway, how you would think that these people would be scientific in their approach to evidence. When you guys presented thIs evidence that there was massive amounts of water erosion. The one of the things the guy said that really disturbed me is like, you're talking about a civilization from 10,500 years. He was mocking. He was saying, where's The evidence of thIs civilization? Like what at? What other evidence do you have of this civilization? And it's the way he sang. It is so ridiculous and arrogant and it was so. There was. It was so soaked in ego because the reality is we don't really know how much evidence there would be left from 10,500 bc. That is a long, long, long time ago and it might very well be that the only things that remain are things like this face and this function closure.

Speaker 5:          00:19:15       Well, there's. There's a good reason for that to actually shaka and I are about to set off on on a new book between us called dancing down the breeds of syrah and then the subtitle is a scholar and the scientists send gloss the unicorns and take on the paradigm police because the printers that a sufi and it's. You know, it's so busy. That's the mystical aspect of islam and there's a metric. It's a metaphor and sufi doctrine and in order to get to the truth, in order to get to enlightenment on the. Let's say the seeker must must cross the bridge of sarah, which is described as narrow as a razor's edge. And on one side is the chasm of cruelty. And then the other side is the is the abyss of skepticism. So to do this stuff, you really have to have, I mean it's very difficult, it's easy to say you have an open mind, but you'd be surprIsed how few people have an open mind. We got some experience with this ourselves and when you say, yeah, you would expect that from science, they should be open to evidence, but in fact are not.

Speaker 6:          00:20:28       And so what is their issue? They don't want to admit that they're wrong and that everything that had been teaching for decades was incorrect and it's proven so. So they hold onto the old truth.

Speaker 5:          00:20:37       Well, exactly, but I mean in the way I have a little bit of sympathy for them even because they put in all of these years and you get somebody who comes from out absolutely out of left field me and who doesn't come out of left field? One of them, they're a phd geologist and highly respected and the number of geological solid scientific was published to say you guys have it all wrong and

Speaker 7:          00:21:04       well explain to folks what your background is and why your, uh, such a, a rebel in this field.

Speaker 5:          00:21:10       Oh, well, let me, I don't want to lose thIs thread because I have no, that's okay, but when I'm on my, when I do, when I'm on my trips, people always ask, we are going through the evidence and instead of taking half an hour of the way we are now, we've been ours down. Liz links studying every aspect of the geology and so someone, and they always say, well, how they seek leave whitney said that has the evidence, how can they denied? And that's. I always were cans and anecdote that funny when I was a kid, I read this long before I was even interested in this stuff, but it was a teaching tail supposedly a proven that this was the 19 forties. ReAder's digest an anecdote in there that when you actually have the asha heifetz, the great violinist gables, debbie bill at carnegie hall at the age of 11, I think this must have been for 43, something like that.

Speaker 5:          00:22:09       I was a kid. And um, and at the concert was the then reigning violin, virtuoso dynamic mischa elman. You don't hear much of these days, but he was sort of tinkers, look them up today and with him was our to rubinstein, the great pianist and about halfway through the concert element turn to elmo term to rubinstein and he said, hot in here isn't it? And we're going to start and said not for pianists. So, so, so with our, with our science, the geologists have no problem with it or the micro biologist. So the astrophysicists, the egyptologist and the archaeologist that's hot.

Speaker 7:          00:22:56       So what, what can be done? I mean what you guys are presented this evidence, they've tried to ignore it, but more things pop up that show that we might be wrong about the history of humanity. like go back like tappy. Exactly. Exactly.

Speaker 5:          00:23:09       Exactly. We now have the smoking guns at our disposal. We have an arsenal of smoking guns and you see we have even more of an instant was in that video we presented. There's a lot more evidence just from Egypt that we presented in another csa conference in $2,000. Again, with the almost unanimous ascent of the attending geologists, but that one unfortunately didn't have much press there, so it didn't. It didn't get a lot of press. The geologists were impressed but it didn't go anywhere, but we now have. We've had for a while all of the evidence at our disposal, the

Speaker 8:          00:23:46       template which you mentioned and I don't know how many of your audience will know about that. That's serious. That's the smoking gun because here's this incredible site in Turkey and chalk and I have visited there and spent about a week there that was discovered in 1994 and I hope we'll get pictures of this up there, but it was discovered in 1994. Absolutely. By accidents. Looks like a big hill. I mean it is a big hill and you'd never know that there was anything there. And in [inaudible], 94 farmer was plowing the top of the hill and he hit what he thought it was. A boulder and plow hit the boulder and he ran the plow back over the to try to dislodge it and it wouldn't just lodge. And I tried a couple of times and nothing happened except they've met their cloud and so they dug around it and they discovered that it wasn't a boulder after ella was the top of the stone column, so they started digging some more and then finally they called them the archeologists, which now they're sorry about because they commandeered the site and these guys 20 years, 15 years later fighting the turkish government is get some kind of financial redress from stealing, stealing their help.

Speaker 8:          00:25:01       Anyway, once once they got excavating, they discovered that this was one of the greatest archeological discoveries probably of all time. I mean from, from a hisTorical point of view, it's even more significant and it looks like two comments treasure because once they stopped, they dug up the first of these and they found they did ground penetrating radar or maybe seismograph. So I'm not sure. But certainly radar. And this huge hill has at least 22 closely packed stone circles like minnie stone hinges, but not so many central columns. There are central columns to central columns in each of these stone circles and then ring the round with other funds. I mean everybody listening to this who's watching this will have an image of a stonehenge and in their heads, so it's like that except not as not as massive, but then further further as they were digging, they realized that this entire hill, which had been at one point or another, exposed to the elements of course had been deliberately filled in.

Speaker 8:          00:26:18       what reason? Nobody knows, I mean is a lot. This is acres of land and the thing had been completely covered and they were able to date the film because the film has all kinds of organic material in it and so the film they dated to $8,000. They see things that they go back to. The temple itself is incredible site. Nobody knows what the air for who did it or anything is at least 10,000 bc and the central columns that I was talking about, our 10 to 15 tons. They know that the law, I think we limestone, but the stones come from a quarry about three quarters of a mile downhill, so they have to drag these up. Now we're talking about 10,000 bc. Has to be any civilization, much less tools or anything of that sort. So here are these under 22 of these stone circles. Only four have been partially excavated and not only on the four.

Speaker 8:          00:27:12       Out of 22, pardon? I said only four out of 22 have been activated and oldest time archeology is an unbelievably. It's done. It's done meticulously and nowadays it tends to bed and not so long ago it's just grave robbery, but now it's really meticulous. They going at this stuff with teaspoons, so it takes them years and years and years to do it. Then I guess there isn't a gigantic amount of funding available. I don't know who's funding it. It's a german team that's doing it with a really nice, really good guy. Klaus schmIdt, german archaeologist who was in charge there, who's, you know, he's not into the esoteric side of things. It's shocking irr, but because he's a solid guy, he's pretty good and a nice man, so anyway, the apart from the size of these stones and the finesse that they had that then it goes into creating them. They're also elaborately decorated and they're high relief.

Speaker 8:          00:28:13       What's called high relief. In other words, let's say you want to do what you want to carve in a wild boar or bird or in one case a lion or some sort of a line. You cut the back. We cut the stone away so that the image springs out of the stone. This is 10 times more work than carving something into the stone and this is all we got. Any tunes as far as anyone knows. Certainly any metal tools. I'm with flint somehow or another and you got acres of these things and they. The archeologists do not dispute the dating of 10,000 bc earlier. So that's our smoking gun. I mean we've been looking at this for a long time and all kinds of evidence and some of the. A lot of the evidence is really commanding, but it's not spectacular looking now. It's spectacular.

Speaker 7:          00:29:10       Sorry, what I found amazing about it was that they were trying to attribute these constructions to hunter and gatherers.

Speaker 8:          00:29:18       Well, mayBe they are hunters and gatherErs. I mean, you have to be a fool if there's plenty of animals and stuff around there. Plenty of things around to eat. Why should you go to the backbreaking job of farming is legible. Actually, I have in my first non fiction book, I don't know if you know this, I started out as a novelist, playwright, screenwriter, and I had a lot of things done that will make me money was probably a good thing for egyptology black. Um, there's a, you know, if you ever heard of him, but in the first book was called the case for astrology, which is out of print now, but let's put together all of the scientific evidence that says it's actually something behind it. It's not just what's a good day to buy a poodle. So the, in this, in that book, that's my first nonfiction book, but I quote a is a wonderful ethnologists conrad lawrence who was brought up in South Africa. You wrote a wonderful book. Bush probably still around bushman are about his own experience and he relates how the bushman of South Africa, the missionaries are trying to teach them how to farm and the machine looks at him and he says, well, why should we farm when there were so many mongo, mongo nuts in the world? Whatever that is, why would anybody in their right mind boggling the plow the land and cut everything down when they go outside? I feel hurt, efficient, untitled.

Speaker 1:          00:30:48       So just because they were hunter gatherers doesn't mean they hadn't figured out amazing constructions. The ability to make these huge cities and these just

Speaker 8:          00:30:57       that. And in this last couple of decades, I mean, I've been on this quest for what? All to swallowed the little bit in the late sixties. So that's when I said something like that close to it. And, and, but in the last 10 or 12, a whole lot of really interesting work has come to the fore proving that not only that, these in these so called primitive societies that maybe we're not intellectually sophisticated. They nevertheless had, they had a precise cosmological science and actually some, uh, some of them like pals involved in this, you may know some of them, but you may not know. Some of them, they might be interesting guests for you in an upcoming shows. If people know people will really, really get tuned into this sort of thing. So it's becoming quite cleAr that, that the knowledge was all there. I mean the knowledge is there.

Speaker 8:          00:31:57       The groundbreaking book, was he making them about it? What it's called hamlet's mill. Do you know that? Discuss that one. I've heard you discuss it. You're right, it's, it's georgiadis. I mean these are two impeccable historians of science at mit, Georgia, this santiana and carrots up on deck hand and in the book as I think published in 68. But again, this is the thing you have to go through when you're, when you're dealing with these heretical things. I mean these guys with all the right credentials, not like may not come from out of left field and they manage the stonewall them and try to and try to ignore their evidence that underlying the world's mythology, all of these strange stories that we know incestuous gods and all of this kind of thing was astronomy and astronomy presupposes the santiana and can go into that much because they were in enough water as it was, but there is absolutely no point to a sophisticated astronomy unless there's an astrology behind it. At least in the old days. Nowadays they're busy looking for quasars and black holes and all that sort of thing, which have no meaning at least let's say, at least in the emotional and philosophical sense, but in the old days, whole civilizations, Egypt included, were attuned to the emotions of the stars. In other words, there's a lot of literature on this,

Speaker 7:          00:33:29       this. Why do you think that this culture that we live in right now is so reluctant to accept anything like astrology? Why do you think they would like to dismiss it so quickly?

Speaker 8:          00:33:41       Well, because, because, because this is a materialistic, this is a materialist culture that denies anything that has any meaning, I mean material materialism, which is the reigning philosophy. This is what everybody learns in school certainly get nothing esoteric and school, nothing mystical and unfortunately the, the, the skeptic, the skeptic's of basically rationalism, materialism. Atheism basically is, it's, it's, it's basically the religion of the emotional, defective and spiritually dyslexic, and then contemporary, materialistic science value does not exist. In other words, it's value is by definition subjective, so these people are ermine because they can't find the meaning in their own lives and the wrong existence to, to foist that emptiness that neil ism upon everyone else, but they call it rationalism or reason. It's nothing of the sort because it is nothing but nothing.

Speaker 7:          00:34:55       It just seems to reason that our bodies are affected by the moons and the tides and women's periods are. And you know, people behave differently during different moon cycles. The oceans there are affected by the tides. I mean, that's affected by the fact that the moon can affect the oceans and we're mostly water when we just assume that planets are having some sort of an effect on tubal. That'S right. Where did it all come from? where did astrology originate from? Like what is the, what is the bottom, what is at the end of it? Like, who invented it?

Speaker 8:          00:35:27       We know what we can say is that if, if going back into the paleolithic now we're, when we think actually those figures shock and I think that the figures in the paleolithic in the beckley tapio probably cosmological and astronomical and can prove it yet. However, the santiago that can do a very good job of showing that that's um, that astronomy under underpins the most ancient mythologies that we have. And since these guys, since the ancients I'm not just interested in quasars and pulse and all of these sorts of things. It presupposes and astrology and in fact in Egypt and Egypt was once one society that I know the most aBout it, but the same I'm sure applies to ancient China and India and mayans and so on, that the entire society is orchestrated in sUch a way that, that it is tuned to these cosmic cycles and we still have, you know, there's a reason why christmas is the day that it is and there's a reason why easter is the day that it is supposed to, to commemorate historically in certain certain elements in the, you know, in the life of jesus christ.

Speaker 8:          00:36:52       But actually that's, it's much older than that and, and the, the ancient societies knew what they were doing and when you get deep into Egypt, you see that there. That life itself was a kind of a magical. It's like a magical recreation of the genesis of the universe in which by celebrating it in certain ways and certain kinds Of ceremonies and so on, human beings are reliving the cosmic process and thereby accessing the divinity that is responsible for us being here, whIch is not supposed to, which is not creationism. Music. Anytime you tried to say to a rational of scientists that, hey, there really is a meaningful life. There's all your creation was you think the world was greater than seven days? No, that's the name that you know god with big white beard was up there and this guy's angle today. I think it'll create mosquitoes and there's nothing to do with that.

Speaker 8:          00:37:52       If it'S a much more profound philosophy, but if it is not amendable to study by a materialist science, but who sat and materialist science is the be all and end all and the answer to everything. Only the material is to say that, but they've got everybody, including the people who when we put the educational system together, conned into believing that their science is the only signs. The engines new, new much better and they did much better. I mean all you have to do is go to Egypt to experience these unbelievable temples in this fabulous art to understand that something is going on that isn't going on now. This is one of the, I mean it's a big subject. We won't even get into it in an open ended, in an open ended talk like this black chalk and I will be talking about in the booklet where we're planning this, dancing down the bridge of sarah and um, and in the video, the big followup to the mystery of the strengths that we're hoping to put together, funding for, which we hope to go as a theatrical release, not just on television. Some get sales first and then onto the videos and theaters and tb and all that sort of stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:39:14       You have to have lIke an animated dog or something to go with you to Egypt if you want to get it into theaters to get people to really get a interested in the history of the banks and all that stuff, that's going to be difficult to get into theater. No, it's silly people we have in this world.

Speaker 8:          00:39:30       See, I mean we had our show that mr. banks was a huge success. Unfortunately my ex partner now deceased, stole a whole lot to 150 grand from the till so he never made any money out of it, but he was an interesting guy and without going without him, that never would have happened because he had the energy in the eye. I can sink but I don't. I'm not a manifestor and he got the whole thing going so I don't know

Speaker 1:          00:40:01       if you had a penguin, a penguin, the travels to Egypt and you get morgan freeman to narrate it.

Speaker 8:          00:40:07       No jail. we don't need it actually is that video had was on sweeps week and had it had a huge audience over the course of its lifetime. It still gets you on every once and it was amazing. It was probably seen by. I tried to figure it out one day. It was probably seen by at least 250 million people over over the number of years that it was being shown internationally and so on. People Are really interested in this stuff and still express it. We don't need any penguins which is paid. In this case. We just need the science because I'm the see the material is is glamorous in its own right now we have all of this other stuff. It's not just the Egypt. We have Turkey. There are these. I don't know if you've seen this, the truck shop very fascinated like easter island, which may be connected with these things. You know the more I have easter island, right? Did you know that up until quite recently it looks like they're just kind of these big figures that are their heads basically heads into ourselves, right? we're alone. I can't imagine them. I took them onto just 200 years to figure it out. They started excavating these things and they're finding that their full full length statute. So in other words, they have built up around them maybe 25 feet, 30 feet of silt, and now the question is, and this should be relatively easy to determine, this

Speaker 5:          00:41:34       is part of our big project and will when you except that the in the dome and civilization. The followup, the mystery of the strengths, because it should be possible to carbon date the lower layers of the sill and our conviction is that these things may take back again, thousands and thousands and thousands.

Speaker 1:          00:41:53       Have they done this? I mean, I've seen the excavations

Speaker 5:          00:41:56       not well. They're excavating, but we don't have any carbon dating. Suck as a bloody. It's julian who is the ambassador somewhere or another. Anyway, he's connected to easter island. You should be able to find out in Florida and then not only as you see, we've got to hold this stuff now. It's really exciting. The, um, not only go back leads happy, but have you heard about the bracelet that was found fairly recently in Turkey? No. Are you on. I know, I know graham hancock's been on your show or are you on his mailing list that he has? I'm sure he sends out. I mean, that's his whole job. That's what he does and sends out this enormously comprehensive list of everything that's interesting happening in science that either directly or tangentially affects this whole lost civilization hypothesis anyway.

Speaker 1:          00:42:58       Are you familiar with the oBject that they found? The bottom of the baltic sea recently, very recently, it looks like a millennium falcon. It looks like, you know, a few took the star wars spaceship, millennium falcon and put it in the bottom of the ocean. That's what it looks like. They don't know what it is, but they're sendinG divers down like I believe it's this week.

Speaker 5:          00:43:21       oh yeah, I heard about that. Yeah, and it's somebody that will say when see will see when they, when they figure it out because it has to be seriously careful about that stuff. You know about soccer and myself. Dive,

Speaker 1:          00:43:34       yes,

Speaker 5:          00:43:35       no, that we're convinced graeme thinks otherwise, but we're shocking myself. Convinced that this is amazing looking place is in fact perfectly natural. Wow. Really explain. Yeah. We can explore. We can pretty well explained how it's done and we didn't want to think that that would have Been a smoking gun, but we're. We're convinced that it's natural.

Speaker 1:          00:43:55       You saw those two giant. You Saw those two giant pizza box looking pieces of rock that were stacked next to each other side by side and you that look natural. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:44:06       It's a hard, isn't it? You know, it's hard to describe, just know without having the pictures there, but more time and I had the big thing with me. We, we could show you why we're convinced that it is indeed completely

Speaker 1:          00:44:22       natural. You've seen all the images on graham hancock site, I'm assuming. Did you do any diving yourself? A yana goes,

Speaker 5:          00:44:29       yeah, yeah. We were there for a week and then there are a couple

Speaker 8:          00:44:32       of times and he's, as I said, it's in our own interest. This as to see this is the evidence we're looking for, but we don't think it is. We think graham was making a big mistake and insisting that it is

Speaker 7:          00:44:44       dr schoch the geologist. What was his explanation for how it was created?

Speaker 8:          00:44:49       Well, you see if you go because the people who are taking the pictures initially and it's they're not trying to fool anyone, they're just taking the cool, exciting looking pictures, but if you follow some of those ridges, it looks so perfectly vertical and so perfectly horizontal. You'll see them just kind of tAper into disappearance living rock face and when you get really down in your notes to the rock, you see the, the, the corners aren't finished. You see that the rocks have been wrenched out of their place. It's place, it's dangerous diving there. and I'm not a diver. I'm very, very strong currents and I mean I have a master diver glued to me, so, um, but, but when you go down the shore, I'm in shock and I went there on this very nice japanese in their finance. The whole thing was really interested in it.

Speaker 8:          00:45:46       We do it to be wet blankets, but I'm the last day that we were there we went, we went looking around the island and looking at other stuff when we went to a place about a couple of miles from the actual yoga goonie site and they're at the water's edge and it's a certain kind of shale. It's a very hard shale formation that is laid down in very regular horizontals. But that is cross cut by, um, fault lines. And it's like if you imagine a gigantic stone layer cake that's already cut into pieces, but they have the pieces haven't been served. And so what happens is that by the action of the winds and the waves, because the southern formation, similar inflammation was right at the water's edge and he could watch the waves pounding up against the current running. And What would happen is that eventually the water, the running water and the waves and tides, unos, typhoons and all the rest sort of work into the fault lines which are softer rock.

Speaker 8:          00:46:58       And eventually they get it to the point that the action of the waves pulls away a big chunk of rock. This is all set down and layers. So that falls into the water. And again, we're talking about thousands and thousands of years. Gradually the whole, the whole pIece of brought disappears because it's all laid down on these kind of layer cake layer cake levels. And so we, we saw this with because we had our own skins over the course of the. It was the last thing in the world. We wanted to be happier. If you believed that it was an ancient civilization, well we had it all planned. I was going to write it up to the national geographic or sony or something like that and scott was going to write it up that they for the geological, the geological journals and all of that sort of stuff.

Speaker 8:          00:47:51       And I'm young and we say, well, no. Did you see the stone circle? It's like a. There's like pillars arranged in a circle, but you see that no. Again, we're convinced that there's no context for anything there and things that I'm not. Things that are manmade have a context. And as I said, when we, when we saw we would sit, we would still be uncertain about it if we did not go a couple of miles down and watched a similar sort of thing being formed right in front of our eyes and go back there. When we do this, our next, this next element that makes you want to do one will be one of our, one of our sites that assuming we can get the funding together, but we will be, um, will be concentrating upon because it's an object lesson both in, in how careful you have to be when you're looking.

Speaker 8:          00:48:50       No, I mean we have a stake in this too and that where we have to give up on this. I had a moment, a slight pang not much because I really liked the core academics, but he had a slight pang of compassion for them when somebody comes along and destroys their paradigm, which is us. So anyway, so young. That's the only goonie and um, but anyway. oh, back to back to this incredible bracelet. This was just a couple of months ago. They found a bracelet somewhere in Turkey. Turkey is turning out to be more and more interesting. There are all kinds of great places in Turkey and the just around bracelet made of obsidian. Obsidian is an incredibly hard stone and very difficult to work. And like dated, I'm not exactly sure how their data might be in the, where it was found the strada where it was found.

Speaker 8:          00:49:54       They dated it to around 8,000 bc, but the, the, it's a very elegant little, I mean didn't look like that much. It's just elegant and beautiful. And the archeologists realized when they studied it that the finish on it was something that nowadays you could only do with the most sophisticated instruments, lasers or something of the sort and moreover that it had a very complex and subtle geometrical shape. So in other words, you cAn't do a thing like that. It's very hard to imagine doing some something of that nature that's really rigorously geometrical without having the geometry at your fingertips.

Speaker 7:          00:50:38       So you'd have to have some sort of a computer, a machine, something has to. You have to have something that you're, you built to construct this, right? Is that what you're saying?

Speaker 8:          00:50:48       We don't know. This is, this is the contention of chris christopher done. They know chris knows he's. Well he's, he's a high tech guy and he designs engineer. He is, but he's the guy who designs the instruments, really precise instruments that do things like make pieces for the space shuttle and stuff, their instruments that are calibrated to 10 thousands of thousands of an inch and he's done studies in Egypt and finds that that's what you'll see all over the place that there a monstrous pieces of granite. let me put this [inaudible]. He's been on a couple of trips with me. He's a good guy and he, he has his flying special instRuments that you know, a calibrated to a 10 thousands of an inch and the places that some piece of granite and old kingdom granite and granted is 100 percent completely true. And, and chris as you know, is, is fairly adamant that in order to do this they had to have had some sort of technology that would allow them to do that shotgun. I'm not so sure because technology is technology and mostly they have some miraculous realm of technology that we can't even imagine because you would have expected, particularly in a place like Egypt so much from the past times. Somewhere along the line you need to have some evidence of this kind of technology and the dump.

Speaker 7:          00:52:26       You mean by saying technology, you mean something that cuts the, like a machine, something that can cut the marble and polish it down to be 100 percent flat? Yes, exactly. What is the conventional? What is the conventional egyptologists? How do they say they built it?

Speaker 8:          00:52:45       They don't address the question of being since there is no. Since there is no, there is no evidence for that technology. They just assume that they did it by hand somehow or another, and maybe they did, but when you realize the level of perfection of these things and how impossible it would be today to do them by hand. Um, I mean they're just say, oh, well in those days everybody had lots of time and time was no, it was not of any concern that it could work on it until I got it right. Well, that's the sort of a fudge hands. You can't legitimately postulates and advanced technology when you don't have any evidence for it.

Speaker 7:          00:53:28       Right. There was another issue with the vases, correct? The stone vases that were made that we can't duplicate today.

Speaker 8:          00:53:35       Oh, well, maybe we could, but we'd have to go. We got to use a lot of very special machinery to do it and since there's no evidence that he had this kind of machinery, these rounds, no clauses that are, you know, the shape like this and they have a narrow neck and the hollow on the inside and, and they're perfect. I mean they can know, they can tap into the inside and see that the inside is hollowed out perfectly and we can't, we don't know how they could possibly have had what kind of a drill or anything they could have had to do this in a very hard stone. Vases and they date from a very early

Speaker 8:          00:54:18       Egypt, not I'm not a later period. They lost the ability. This is one of the strains and some of the most spectacular stuff comes from the earliest periods contract right now. There's a terrific, there's a terrific show. And the, uh, the metropolitan museum of art, I think the dawn of the egyptian art and it's all the preterm nastic work force housing five, three, four or 5,000 bc and they're collected. It's not, it's not because they do a retrospective, they get, gets from here and bits in there and so on. So they put together this really fabulous shoW because normally you don't see much treated nastic art together in one place. And when you look carefully and you see what's going on and you know, what you, you, what you're looking at, I mean if it was somebody who not spent 30 years studying Egypt, you don't look really impressive. That'S in pieces. They're mostly quIte small. But if you have an eye for this and you've done a lot of study and ask a lot of questions, you see how spectacularly beautiful these things are. Zoned shows on till august. So anybody in the neighborhood make sure you get to the mat. How does it happen? an awful lot of press, but it's, it's a terrific show.

Speaker 7:          00:55:36       So you guys want to put a date of the civilization of Egypt to somewhere around $30,000 pc. That's your idea, right? Yeah.

Speaker 8:          00:55:46       Probably. It could even be earlier. We don't actually, we're me backtrack a little bit.

Speaker 7:          00:55:53       My. My question is how did one civilization like Egypt, how did that one thing rises up and it seems so much more advanced than any civilization anywhere, anywhere around it. Like how did that take place so long ago?

Speaker 8:          00:56:09       A little bit different than see this physical situation of Egypt is such as bone guys this nowadays since,

Speaker 7:          00:56:20       but your, your, your theory. I'm sorry. Your theory puts it in a time where it wasn't though your theory puts the creation of Egypt at the time where it was lush and rained all the time. It was essentially a rainforest.

Speaker 8:          00:56:32       Well that takes it way back further, but then we go back, we accept that and now we're talking 10,000 bc and who's to say what they haven't discovered yet? What was the climate? And I find so and the other civilizations you see he has this physically, physically unique situation where things don't. Whether away. I mean, once they get covered up with sand just there and plus the fact that, you know, in the old days this was a, this was a kind of blessing civilization in which we hardly have to do any work to get fed either the nile would flood and we planted some seeds and I grew up when the windows, when the flood season game again, we had a fairly populous, um, that was a substantial population there with nothing to do. No television, no american idol and nothing to do all day long, all night long. And so they, they, they, you know, they, the whole, the entire society was put to work building these fabulous, fabulous temples and monuments and doing the artwork and so on. So the other places, I mean I'm pretty well convinced because the doctrine in all of this work in the last decade or so, proving that the cosmology, in other words, the sophisticated understanding of life and significant significance of live in the geometry, astronomy and so on was all, they're universally India and China and the other places just didn't have the physical

Speaker 8:          00:58:05       capacity to build on that scale or maybe they just play to do it anyway. They had other ways of manifesting this kind of, let's say this kind of understanding. And this is another thing that just not even taking into consideration by the academics. You don't need sacred architects, you know, magnificent sacred architecture to express

Speaker 8:          00:58:33       spirituality. We could have a society and they probably are some express their, let's say their, their, their spiritual longings. It's only in danced and at the end you would have known even the society, for example, there are sacred dances in the gurdjieff work that I do. They have what are called the movements and boy, you're getting into these things. I mean they're pretty amazing and yet we do them today, but because he, they sacred dance exists in lots of different societies, but you don't need to build temples in order to express it. The egyptians done it that way. I'm the chinese and the indians did too, but not that early and there was no, it's less than that.

Speaker 9:          00:59:24       what, how did the civilization just spring up like this though? Created such incredible works of art and incredible work. You know the, the architectural designs of these, these buildings,

Speaker 8:          00:59:36       we don't. No, we don't know. But when you see that, see that's one of the eye openers of this very interesting don and civilization exhibit at the met because you don't have temples and you don't have to have big buildings, but you have very many instances of very sophisticated sculptured done. Very hard stones. I mean beautifully finished. So they had it. They could do it and as I said earlier, we've got build beckley company that is not an argument for that. Go back to the topic of easter island. Turn out to be ancient. Well then they are. I mean, if it's, if, if you can date, it's sort of amazing, they haven't done it or maybe they have an, I don't know about it, but if you can, you can show them that the earliest levels of filled that had buried them up to their chests goes back to let's say go back. We have templates on rather than we've got another instance of spectacular artwork at the time when there's not supposed to do such a thing. I mean, the whole thing is in the process of being turned upside down, ideally by us.

Speaker 9:          01:00:54       It's an incredibly fascinating subject and one that it drives me crazy. It's uh, the, the, the timeline is such a fascinating thing. Like where did civilization emerged from the, when, how did it get so incredibly sophisticated at one point in time, ancient Egypt and then somehow or another, all that stuff was lost, you know, somehow or another through the burning of the library of alexandria and the romans and the greeks and everything throughout history up until today. So much informaTion has been lost is, is there a natural disaster in the middle of there somewhere? Did something happen to the human race, were wiped out a significant number of us. And then we had to refigure things out. Is that what happened?

Speaker 8:          01:01:35       Well, could be or it stayed there and sort of a dormant state until it was time to, to reinvented. And acTually it does go for the, that for example, you see when you're dealing with the academia, um, they, they're very resistant to, to interpreting their own data in any way that disagrees with their preconceptions. But you're familiar for sure with the paleolithic caves, right? Grants. Olesko. Do you know the one? I'm the most recent one discovered in the early nineties? Close show today. Hold on the same area. You know that one?

Speaker 9:          01:02:16       No, I don't know that one.

Speaker 8:          01:02:18       C, h a l v, e t, I think I must of what's going on in that one. And, and this was discovered. It's named after the guy who discovered, and this is up up until now, the most spectacular, the most spectacular of the caves was the one that lost. Go with the famoUs all of bowls. And the other one, that place called alta mira, which again is a very high level of artwork and both of those, both of those caves of dated to around 17, 18,000 bc and the basis of evidence in the caves will show that it has the most spectacular art. The law. I mean it's, it's as though it were designed by drawn by a whole bunch of paleo, picasso's coming spectacular stuff. When you, when you pull it up online will say it and spell it again please. C h a, v e t or b, e z. I think, wow, this is amazing stuff.

Speaker 8:          01:03:24       He got it up right now. You see this day date to 31,000 bc bright, but they don't see. They don't put two and two together. They can't do higher mathematics and academia because two and two tells you that artwork at this level. And I mean where are they getting the paint from? What are they doing with their fingers? Presumably we can't go into the local art supply shop and get know, get acrylic paints the painting that's on the inside of the cage. It's got to be pitch black and when you look at the level of artwork, you realize that this is not done by primitives. In order to to do art of that, on that level, you have to have your act together. Even if you're wearing bear skins, you know, it really does look like the animals they're chasing and it's all done from memory.

Speaker 8:          01:04:20       that's very impressive. Well, we were shocked and I think that because there's been a very good guy minutes for it forever, for a long time. He was at a conference that we did named frank ed to interpret it, the hall of bulls lasko as an astronomical basically as not having an astronomical significance of dots and dogs on the wall that represented the pleiades and other constellations and I think he's probably correct and it wouldn't have surprised me to see. The usual explanation is, oh, well that's magic because of my paint, the water, these animals on the wall, they'll be able to hunt them. I'm not so sure I'm. I'm more inclined to think that it may be in some in some way or another star map or have some sort of cosmological significance and it does a book for french member of the academy actually going to go the sacred geography of ancient Greece? No, it's another one. It's a different moment. That's one book. There's another one by amateurs. In other words, not credentialed. Whatever enough, if that means anything close. Plato's secret elliot's in which they show that the iliad, which is the most boring book ever written, is actually a gigantic, like a planetarium and all of this so and so's being killed.

Speaker 10:         01:05:54       No, the the, the

Speaker 8:          01:05:56       heroes. Rosa here and the armies of doing all of this sort of stuff. It's a terrible board read, but if it's decoding as a star map, like as like a planetarium and the action from about 9,000 bc on the whole thing makes all of a sudden made sense. This is why they go into all of that trouble to do all of this work decoded as a sky map. How? How do you decode it as a sky map? He has to read the bucket. It's complicated because the stars, let me see if I remember correctly, the army's represent constellations, the heroes of the particular bright stars in the, in the, in the particular constellation, and the elliot is all about this army is going here and that ami is going here and this one is over powering this one and if you're decoding astronomically, if it's tracking the constellations across the sky because the, the relationships of the stars and the constellations to each other, change over time.

Speaker 8:          01:06:58       So as everybody knows, why should they do that? I don't know what he said. The astronomy and this is now even getting, even the academics, there's a realizing that that astronomy plays a huge role in very ancient civilizations and the only reason as far as I'm concerned, but I can't prove it. We only reason it has to be not only is astrologically significant because otherwise we would care. I mean, for example, hamlet's mill, um, something that can go to a lot of trouble to show that very ancient myths as far back as you go know about the procession of the equinoxes. I was just about to ask you about that. I said I was just about to ask you about that. That's it. That's amazing. Explain that to people. Okay. the possession of the equinox is there is because supposedly because of the level of the earth with their other other explanations that I liked, ben made the whole solar system that's turning around a binary star.

Speaker 8:          01:08:05       UM. Anyway. Doesn't matter. The act is that, let's say if you look the way that this now we're still in the. Let's say we're in the age of pisces, which means that if you look at the spring equinox, if you watched wait for the sun to rise, it's rising an hour before the sunrise is. You'll see the sun coming up and the constellation behind the sunrise is the very last degrees of pisces. And pretty soon you can't synthesize. They pretty soon it will be aquarius. So the age of aquarius for musical was now very gradually. It's cool. The precession, the, the entire zodiac precesses against the, the sun. So in other words, it doesn't go and you look at astrology areas, as you know, is whatever it is, April 20th, march, 22nd, and then it goes because aries, taurus, gemini cancer and so on. Precesses means it goes backwards. So it's in pisces now and it'll soon be in aquarius. Now that the rate at which that cycle takes canonically exactly, exactly that 25,920 years. So what this means is that for the sun to precess one degree takes 72 years. Now how do they figure that out and why should it be important to you? Imagine looking at the sky. I don'T want people to be looking at this guy for some reason or another and realize that the sun takes 72 years to go one degree.

Speaker 9:          01:09:53       There was a book that graham hancock had discussed once on an interview. I wish I could remember the name of it, but it was discussing this, this number 72, and that this knowledge of the procession of the equinoxes has been installed in many, many ancient cultures and religions.

Speaker 8:          01:10:10       Exactly. It has met. That gets you into numbers, symbolism and got gets you into sacred,

Speaker 9:          01:10:15       so it lets us know that they knew a lot more than we thought they knew just about the universe itself, the constellations themselves, the wobble of the earth's axis, a 26,000 year cycle. They knew about this somehow or another 10, 15,000 years ago. That's really. That's incredible.

Speaker 8:          01:10:33       It is. And you see it's this kind of thing that is rigorously excluded from any kind of academic discussions until it's stuffed down their throats. This is exactly what we plan to do.

Speaker 9:          01:10:48       The current, the, the conventional egyptologists date, their construction of the pyramids to 2,500 Bc, right? Is it correct?

Speaker 8:          01:10:58       Yes.

Speaker 9:          01:10:58       What? What's that? What's that based on?

Speaker 8:          01:11:02       Well, it's based on the. It's based on the reigns of key ops, kafra of friend and so on. And this is. This is very complicated

Speaker 5:          01:11:14       because we're chunking. Myself and my colleagues think that in all likelihood, the pyramids that we see today are doing deed date from that period. However, and this is again formally, easily provable. They are built, they are super imposed or replace structures that were there earlier and even the academics acknowledged that the giza plateau was was a single template to some very interesting work coming up soon proving that that's the case, so whenever the sphinx was built, they were also structures that we don't know if there are pyramids or not, but in the paramedics, particularly the second pyramid, the pyramid that's associated with the spanx, you can see that there are two different styles, two radically different styles of masonry and the lower the lower courses have built these gigantic blocks. the size of practically the size of this room. I'm not quite, but anyway, massive maybe 8,000 ton blocks and then piled on top of them on the much and very finely finished on a much lesser smaller cruder masonry.

Speaker 5:          01:12:37       That's rather typical of of the old kingdom. now whenever I'm in architectural history, no architectural historian would not. Contextual historian knows instantly that when you see two different styles of architecture in the same building, you know you're looking at two different periods of building. I mean this as a rough example, suppose you have a victorian house, but you've got a modern kitchen in it 100 years from now, with 500 years from now, the archeologists come and discover that house. They will know in two seconds that the houses built in the 19 hundreds or the $1,800 rather than the kitchen is built in 2005 or something of that sort. So this is a given. So when you see two different radically different styles of architecture, you know, you're dealing with two different periods, um, two different periods of construction. And then there are other factors in this.

Speaker 5:          01:13:31       This so called red pyramid. I'm about 20 miles away where the whole pyramid is built and the interior chambers are in perfect condition, uh, built over a ruinous legalistic chamber that they called a plunder tomb chamber. But it's not a plum. The tomb chamber goes the stones in it. I've been exposed to the weather for a long, long time. It's an earlier megalithic construction. We don't know what the dating is, but all of this you see is, is evidence that we will be using in our september one if we managed to flip for budget together and do it, and there's a great history of people building on top

Speaker 9:          01:14:12       of ancient structures that the parthenon and the acropolis, which doesn't get explained that, you know, nobody explains where those gigantic stones came from and why they, you know, how they got into place. Massive, monstrous stones. And so the other thing that you guys had shown that I thought was really fascinating was that below ground when you showed the really ancient constructions, a lot of them were uncovered. A lot of them had to be dug out. They were, they were actually the ones that were under the ground under the sand were the ones that showed the earlier construction methods, which is pretty obvious that much like the sphinx, when they first discovered it had been taken over by saying this is. You're talking about really, really ancient stuff.

Speaker 5:          01:14:56       Yeah. Yeah. Well, this drinks is a bit different because it's cut into a hollow in order to produce this drinks. They had to carve clari the stone around from it, so once it, why they did that first place, nobody really knows. But once they did it, once he turned too soon to desert, we'll leave it the 20, 25 years without sweeping it out. If it goes 30 right up to the neck again.

Speaker 9:          01:15:20       Who, uh, what, who was responsible for cutting the face into the sphinx?

Speaker 5:          01:15:25       Oh, we don't know. We're convinced. We're convinced that it was required because it's much too small for the body. It's disproportionate to the body and some way, well, it looks in better shape for two reasons. One, it's a much harder outcrop of stone and b, it's been restored. The head dresses and all of that. If you look at old photos of the site taken around 1900, so you see that it's really much more weather than it's looked, but they prepared the face and so on. But I mean, this has all kinds of repercussions. For example, well, you know the story,

Speaker 10:         01:16:05       the

Speaker 5:          01:16:06       we're doing the video Mark Lane or was the, the, the loyal opposition as it were in the, in the eighties. Because the sphinx is supposed to look like the pharaoh kopra. He's hadn't looked at least like the federal kopra, but lana did an early computer study when back in the eighties when computers were still pretty primitive in which he said kafra data into the paramed and sorry into the computer and then superimposed the results upon the head of this length and said, well blah. The swing says conference. Well, last, this was sort of silly, but it got a lot of press was in the New York times and I think the smithsonian all over the place. So when we finally got the funding together to do our mystery of the swings, we really had to address that because it was, it was, um, he was well known and you know, people say, well, you know, it's been proved that this links is the face of contra.

Speaker 5:          01:17:00       So how do you disprove it? Well, I wanted to, I wanted to actually use exactly the same message of that lane or years, but seed elvis data into the computer and proved slinks was really meant to be elvis. But the, we thought that was a cool idea. But what happened was that the elvis foundation wouldn't let us use the king's emits in that context and I think elvis would have been furious. He would love to go. But what happened then was my, my criminal partner, boris, who was an interesting guy, he was an ex ex, a race driver. He drove for ferrari for years and lived here for porsche. It was an interesting character. Anyway, he came up with the idea of, well, let's get a forensic detective to go with us to Egypt to, you know, do a study of these places and see if they really could be the same model, the plan, the same human being and so song.

Speaker 5:          01:18:02       Couple of phone calls and we got in touch with a guy named frank domingo is the senior forensic detective from the nyp ed and he came to Egypt with us and this is more long story about how he got frank to agree to go and he did his study and charlotte unquestionably that the toothpaste is could not possibly have been the same. Then the question came up because when you look at the profile of the strings, even though it's pretty ruined us because it's been severely damaged, even though it was damaged, it's quite clear that not only is a different face than that, but it's probably a different race. In other words, it really looks like the sub saharan african place, not even like, not like an egyptian nice. Which would mean it was done by the new orleans who took over Egypt libyans earlier, you know, from your spouse was the new orleans.

Speaker 5:          01:18:56       New orleans don't look like don't look the same light as the sub saharan africans. So and in fact they leave Egypt taller. These jips egyptologists or prejudice does everyone else. The last thing they want to know is that notice that the snakes as, uh, as, as, as, as an african african and, but in, in the earlier, in the 19th century, lots of people just, you know, there was no egyptology then lots of travelers because stuff's labelle and florence nightingale and all kinds of people who wrote very beautifully about Egypt traveling in Egypt than that in the 19th century. Sad. Well, you know, this is a negro I face and the leads of tolerances to simply ignored that. Well, anyway, with frank. So he did this careful forensic study. I think it's on my website. I'm not sure. Actually I should tell you something. My website's [inaudible] dot com or.net and uh, anyway, it's in there somewhere.

Speaker 5:          01:20:01       And um, so we asked him about it that, that um, know what do you think is, can this be an african place? And domingo is a cautious. But he said, well, he said you can't prove that it is, but it is consistent with subsaharan subsaharan physiognomy. And so I'll actually with that was actually my son's very, like, my partner was very funny when he said that he's in like, this is bad news for the, the academics is that not only. First of all it means that, you know, there is an atlantis, it wasn't atlantis and second of all they will black.

Speaker 5:          01:20:47       It was pretty funny. But anyway, subsequently I did an op ed piece for the New York times and I carefully left out this old because this is, you know, we want to go back there and do some more work and I was in enough water with the academics to begin with. So I didn't mention anything about this sub saharan african swank's. But a few weeks later the New York times published a letter from a, an orthodontist and Massachusetts orthodontist. And the orthodontist is another expert in facial, you know, in places. And he came up with it, not as he came up with it and said, yeah, this is, this is an african face. So that was very interesting. And now when we, when we write our book, when we write the shock and I get cracking on the bridge of syrah, we will go into that and actually interviewed, um, track him down.

Speaker 5:          01:21:39       I lives in newton, Massachusetts, the, uh, the orthodontist who wrote that letter and see what he has to say about it. But anyway, that was, that was an interesting thing about the, about the head of the sinks, that it's not original to the, to the fates of the spanx because it's much too small proportion of the body and it seems to be a subsaharan african phase. We don't know when it was required. Maybe the strengths snakes and we think over 30,000 years old and it has to be required in some period of time in between. Well, it may be that that's like living in Egypt at the time. That was the civilization of ease of use. When you get back far enough, there's not much less than. This is why, for example, the paleolithic caves, he. He'll live with a bunch of caves but nothing else. we don't know what anybody else was doing. Along comes, go back, locked up and suddenly the whole everything changes because you've got to have this extraordinary structure that they take the 10,000 bc, so this comes up and it's very difficult to create a detailed picture of what was going on. Then

Speaker 1:          01:22:55       why are they doing work on the sphinx? Why are they like fixing the pause and fixing the ears and are fixing the head dress and all the different things that they've done

Speaker 9:          01:23:06       to the sphinx? That seems to me to be very confusing. I mean you have this amazing ancient structure and they're building on it to like recreate that. The toes of the lion and just seems very odd to me.

Speaker 5:          01:23:18       Well, it is actually very odd. I mean it really is. When you get up next to it, it's pretty crumbly and so and but there's, the jury is still out. if the repairing repairs are not actually doing more damage than would be done if they just left it to the elements. We don't know what they are doing it and I'm very often they're doing it and it's a pretty botched up job. It looks terrible. Yeah, it does mostly look pretty. There's like little pregnancy pregnancy from the toes. Yeah. Yeah. It's really. It's really quite horrible. But you see it's been repaired. The repair campaigns, it's not just modern. The earliest repair campaigns. This is another piece of the big puzzle. The earliest repair campaigns are old kingdom. In other words, the time that the sphinx was, the time that the swing was supposedly built, it was already weathered.

Speaker 9:          01:24:12       Well, isn't that part of the hieroglyphs involved in attributed to one particular pharaoh's name, that he fell asleep and he had a dream that if he uncovered the sphinx, he would control Egypt?

Speaker 5:          01:24:23       Yeah, that's tucked moses. The third, the fourth, and in that tablet that stele there was subsequently flaked off the first syllable of kartra cop named cuff. And from that they, they, they reduced the extrapolated rather instead of will come from, must've been the builder of the spanx. But there's nothing that says that. Well, we think is that comfort was the repair of this banks because even, I mean, mark laners, the loyal opposition notes that when the strengths was first repaired, it was already, whether it's to its present condition. and he nevertheless says that, uh, well the, the, the, this, the old kingdom blocks that were repetitive. It cannibalize from somewhere else. it's really a cockamamie explanation. But you know, when you, when you were playing in their arena and they don't like what the evidence is, they moved the goal posts and that doesn't work well then they changed the rules of the game.

Speaker 9:          01:25:29       Is it their contention? Is the conventional contention that the sphinx was carved with that face originally?

Speaker 5:          01:25:38       Yeah. That's even though it's way out of. Even though, even though it's even though it's much too small proportionately and the rest of the snakes is spectacularly accurate proportionally. Well not only that, we're masters of proportion that they stick with that because it's too inconvenient. You don't until you've dealt with these guys in other fields of science and scholarship, but not much different people are particularly. Men get very stubborn. he's, you know, we're, we're, we're upsetting the apple cart and they make a living selling apples.

Speaker 9:          01:26:16       It doesn't make any sense to me is that, that's completely discounting the actual hard evidence of erosion. There's a very different level of erosion on the face than there is on the rest of the body.

Speaker 5:          01:26:27       Oh, that's okay. Because that's a much harder. That's a much harder outcrop of limestone. So that's been fully exposed whenever it was carved, fully exposed, and it's not really whether that much but more than it looks. You look aT the old photographs you see the back of the head. it had been fairly severely. Whether, but nothing like the body. Yeah. That seems crazy, right? Actually, what? You have to go to jail. He's got to come to Egypt with us.

Speaker 9:          01:26:51       I would love to. I'm scared though. It was scary right now. It wasn't a dangerous.

Speaker 5:          01:26:56       Oh no. Well, not really. Only if you're like trying to run it. No, the, this is the, this is the prestitutes. So it's not that they're lying, but only unrest is news. So even under the worst of circumstances when the revolution was going on, I was after the entire revolution and I refused to leave with the group that I was with. I lead through the aids, you know. And um,

Speaker 9:          01:27:23       why did you refuse to leave? Why did you refuse to leave?

Speaker 5:          01:27:28       Because the government said we were supposed to leave. We said the hell with this wouldn't, not. They're not after us. So let's see what happens. So we waited a few days and the attacker in the streets and little of that sort of stuff, it's spelled the tear gas but nobody was after us so we were a few places we didn't get to, but for the rest we have the time of our lives because we were the only green ngos in Egypt and it was quite an experience when you used the crowds like the superbowl to be there when the place was empty and we didn't miss a couple of places, but we had this fantastic time.

Speaker 9:          01:28:01       So many in the middle of the revolution you're taking tours on and through the sphinx and the temple man and all that.

Speaker 5:          01:28:09       Yeah. They wouldn't let him out after us. Happy to have us there. And wow,

Speaker 9:          01:28:15       that's a dude who's dedicated to Egypt technology.

Speaker 5:          01:28:19       When you say no, and again see at the, at the worst and the revolution that we're talking about this, there were a million people protesting and a couple of different cities, but if there are million people protesting, it means that there are 82 million lawrence. so I have to do is not beat on tahrir square. What was the protest going on? What's nowadays with cell phones, it's very easy to avoid. Oh my god, that's hIlarious. For us, they like having us. There were very sort were a source of income themselves. I'm still doing my trips actually and, and you know, it's not as easy to get them together because I have to go through this explanation all the time, but this is the time to go there as a running at about 20 percent. So that's. Revolution is good for business. Well no, it's terrible. It's terrible for business but for us. Good for the experience. Yeah. And actually I um, in fact instead the next trip is in, the next step is in october. And I have a, I mean, you with your interest, you, you owe it to yourselves to get to Egypt.

Speaker 1:          01:29:26       I do. I have a friend who's the only ancient ruins I've ever seen were mayan ruins and cheech and eatsa. That's, that's about as far as I've seen.

Speaker 5:          01:29:34       Oh, pretty impressive that Egypt is a different kettle of civilization because we know so much about it.

Speaker 1:          01:29:41       Yeah, well usually, you know, so much. If I did go, I would unquestionably go with you a magical Egypt. That dvd series that you have is one of my. All time. My wife would come into the room and look at me and go fucking Egypt again because I'd be sitting there watching this dvd series. She's like, how many of these others? Like eight dvds. So um, how many dvds is the magical Egypt set? Eight. Eight. It's amazing. I've watched it 30 times. I just go back and watch it over again. But you know, it got to, she got a little pissed off at me. She was like enough stupid because I was watching it in the bedroom, you know, like she would come in and have to see sphinxes and shit. ShE not. Oh no, she is a little bit but not, not to the extent. I'm a very obsessive person. And when I first watched this documentary, ed did with charlton heston narrating that I became obsessed with the whole idea of. And then I bought graham hancock's book and then it was all downhill.

Speaker 5:          01:30:40       Well, it's a huge. I mean it's really going exponentially now. But actually I have on my list here, I wanted to mention it to you because you have a pretty big audience. And I have a. I have a standing incentive offer that anybody who gets 10 people together to go on and needs Egypt. Trump gets the freebie. Well minus the minus the airfare and the blockchain. The tips.

Speaker 1:          01:31:07       What we might do, sir, is we might buy out the whole thing by all your whole tour. And then brian downey down to go to Egypt. I'm talking to my cohost, my cohost says, fuck yeah, he's down to go and we'll get all our friends together except joey because joey, he can't leave the country. And uh, we'll, we'll take a desk squad tour to Egypt. That might be amazing. Wow. I'd be down with that kid. Would it be safe to take children?

Speaker 5:          01:31:33       Yeah. Normally. But how old are the kids? Really young too. And for, you know, they're portable at that age, but it's done.

Speaker 1:          01:31:45       That can be done. That's not what I want to hear. I want to hear. Yeah, it's like disneyland.

Speaker 5:          01:31:49       No, I mean depends on the kids, but that's not going to get anything that's spelled 14. They do get something out of it, but you can do is, you know, that the egyptians love kids, so you're just. Wherever your hotel is, you hire a nanny who plays with the kids while we go out and looking.

Speaker 7:          01:32:11       That's never happened. But um, let's talk about the temple and man, because that was one of the most fascinating things of that magical Egypt series was how the egyptians, the construction wasn't just beautiful. IT wasn't just a functional art there, there was, there was a methodology to what they were making were they were literally in that one temple. They neared the human body and explain. Explain that because it's really a fascinating. It's like a tribute to the human anatomy.

Speaker 5:          01:32:45       well, it's not only as a tribute to the human anatomy, but it's stronger de lubicz. The great genius with the unpronounceable name mean names mean a lot. For example, einstein is a great name for a genius of. His name was manny plotnik. No one ever would have heard of a lot smaller and smaller. The luggage was a genius scholar and he really was brilliant and he realized it's a gun. More long story if you're a serpent in the sky and read my book. No, I have not. Uh, okay. Well, start putting the sky. What's called In the sky. It's called surfing in the sky, the high wisdom of ancient Egypt at the center of copy. Anyway, um, he realized as he was doing the work on this on, on Egypt, I'm the temple of luxor. He had actually, he went to Egypt. He was a very interesting men, died in the early sixties and never met him.

Speaker 5:          01:33:42       Um, and he was a practicing alchemists, many of those floating around these days, but he went to Egypt because according to the, and I only realized this quite recently. I thought the opposite until quite recently, but see the, the egyptian tradition percolated down to the west and what are called the hermetic tradition, which is astrology and magic and number symbolism and neoplatonism and all bunch of these other disciplines. Never coherence as It needs it, and schwaller went to Egypt and 37 in order to see if because they, the renaissance scholars, people like jeff dunham, brunello and capital, and all of them were convinced. I mean they took it on trust that Egypt Was the founder of of wisdom. The greeks agreed with that, but nowadays, see this stuff's supposed to civilization. It's supposed to have started with the greeks, but great stock, most of what was consequential and more accurate in their on their own civilization from the egyptians and they're very open about it. It's the modern day quack academics that want to understand that because very interesting book, black asina, the aphrodisiac roots of greek civilization by a very fine cornell scholar called martin burnout and basically he proves that what we call history is really a white supremacist eurocentric invention put together by the, by the ninth, mainly by the 19th and early 20th century historians because they were determined to prove that real civilization began with the greeks. Because the greeks were swarthy little guys, but light enough. They weren't egyptian or submitted or black or anything like that.

Speaker 7:          01:35:43       Or subsaharan african, like the spanx,

Speaker 5:          01:35:45       certainly not so. So really history as it's taught even to this day is really a white supremacist con job.

Speaker 7:          01:35:52       So it really is possible that sub saharan africans might've built all that stuff.

Speaker 5:          01:35:56       Well maybe. Yeah, that could be.

Speaker 7:          01:35:58       They obviously built that face or or likely built that thing.

Speaker 5:          01:36:02       That's very likely. Hey, can I take a break?

Speaker 7:          01:36:06       Yeah. Get yourself some vodka. I wish I had some over your hair. Oh, why don't you. I'll fly you out fella. Okay. Anytime you want to come down to la and do this in person, let me know. All right. We'll be right back with John Anthony West as john goes and uh, get some more vodka. Fucking love it to computer fan. I love all of it. I love his computer fan going off is every time he gets an email to beep, every time you get a fucking text message or a message from skype, that shit comes out. Can you, can you turn that off? Skype messaging, whatever the hell that is. But uh, everybody who's listening to this, thank you very much for, uh, for being patient. And then, uh, and if you're not familiar with this particular subject, it's one of my personal favorites and john's dvd series, which is called magical Egypt, which you can still purchase online.

Speaker 7:          01:37:01       I think it's magical. Egypt.com, I believe you can also get it on amazon and a bunch of different places, but it is just fantastic and it's really, really entertaining stuff and it has to do with so much of why Egypt is so, such a fascinating and mysterious culture. It's really a one of the most amazing dvd series you can get and it's at no one, but it would take a guy like john who's spent his whole life being obsessed with Egypt to produce something like this. It's a real work of a, of passion and interest. And uh, I've, like I told him, I've watched it like 100 times. It's, it's, it's incredible. It's great stuff because he's still gone. Do we have an image of him? Oh, you're back. There you go.

Speaker 5:          01:37:46       No, I don't think he can get it on amazon. You can't. I don't think you can, but you can get it direct through me or through that website so you can go to my website and think. So

Speaker 7:          01:37:57       I thought someone was selling it on amazon. Sometimes they do that.

Speaker 5:          01:38:01       Yeah. I don't think it's on amazon and actually it's really, it's not me, it's my, let's say it's my work that sets it off, but it's really my genius partner named chance gardener who's responsible for that. I mean he, he, he was a guy making a lot of money in la as a three d animator and he got fascinated with this whole subject sort of like you.

Speaker 7:          01:38:24       Well just john, just to let you know, just to let people know and let you know because you might not know this. It is available on amazon.com. Not only is it available on amazon.com, it's also available on amazon instant video. People can watch it instantly. Is amazon jacking you, are they paying you for this, john?

Speaker 5:          01:38:42       No, it's my partner handles the, the, uh, it's amazon who is my partner who handles the business side of things, but I know really

Speaker 7:          01:38:51       well you've been ripped off before, right? He told us she got ripped off for the other one,

Speaker 5:          01:38:55       but in this case I think I'll have to check with chance check in on that guy. Oh, I know that it's, it's, you know, the whole thing is just brings in no money. You know, he's, he's, he's sacrificed for five years of his life putting this extraordinary thing together and then people pirate it all the time. And this thing you can do about it. I mean it's really criminal.

Speaker 7:          01:39:18       Yeah. People, if you want to watch the magical egypt's p series, don't watch it on youtube or watch it on any of those places where it is pirated, please go and a and supported because uh, like I was saying, john, when you went to get your vodka, it's one of my favorite all time dvd series and it would take a guy like you to put something like that together who was such a work of passion. Like very few people are going to put together eight dvds.

Speaker 5:          01:39:42       Who did that really see? I mean he, he, he got it going and I supplied obviously I supplied the egyptology and we conferred on how to do it, but he's single handedly produced it, shot it. It's really brilliant. And you know, as soon as it's done on a shoestring so it doesn't look like a glossy nbc production. But it's beautiful. It doesn't really. I'm proud to have been a part of that, you know? I mean we're partners, but credit where credit is due. I mean left to my own devices. I know I could write, I could write the script, but I couldn't do the production.

Speaker 7:          01:40:17       Yeah, it's really an amazing piece of work.

Speaker 5:          01:40:20       Says well worth getting hold of and actually on, on the subject of putting this stuff together. I've been talking in any number of occasions about us doing this. The next video they zipped happy. The dawn of civilization. And actually I should mention this because I, I have, I have a nonprofit foundation that we set up with that 10 years ago, but the ancient wisdom foundation, but it's been since most of the time, you know, people would contribute now and again we use it for travel and research and that sort of thing. But now we've got a really bright guy contacted me, kind of the whole work and fascinated by the whole thing and he's really, he's got the smarts and the drive to put it all together and rebid the fly it. So it's now, it's now the website is under construction, but we're, we're now looking to both micro finance and macro finance this show.

Speaker 5:          01:41:27       And it's funny because it's been an idea of mine for decades and now it's become a possibility. I mean years ago. So I haven't devoted my entire life through Egypt and these things because I started out as a novelist, a playwright and a screenwriter and have a lot of things done. And actually, I think you asked me this earlier, like I wandered off from the subject, but as a, as a young kid, how did I get into this? I started out, I realized what about the age of 12 or 13 that I was living in a lunatic asylum. Everyone else called progress. But I mean I knew it was madness, but I couldn't put it together. But by the time I was 19 or 20, I knew what I wanted to do. I knew I was in a lunatic asylum and what I wanted to be was I wanted to be a little boy at the emperor has no clothes and that's what I started out writing satire.

Speaker 5:          01:42:21       It's brutal satire plays and things that were done. There might be money. I'm trying to resuscitate some of that stuff now. But anyway, and then gradually, gradually, gradually I understood that there was another. The human beings, we're not always insane. And one, one music, classical music, beethoven's quartets and month of these vessels of 16 it's 10. And then when I was in the army in Germany, needless to say, list drafted my. but I had a great time. I was in Germany, my one and only porsche for $2,400 from the factory talking about. Yeah, well that's what it was. And those was. And I remember driving as I was driving to France and early, it was a november all by myself. I'm early in the morning, went to the cathedral of shots. It was absolutely empty. I mean this is before there was any traveled to europe and, and I realized that it was an epiphany that, you know, however monstrous the church was and is somebody geniuses, built this incredible structure.

Speaker 5:          01:43:32       And then it took another few. I still didn't put it all together and took another few years before and by this time I'd had my first short story published and I was living in Spain on the island, but visa and, and gradually gradually understood, you know, there was another side to this and then all of a sudden, again, more complicated story. But I got interested in the gurdjieff work and be so it would become old touristed up and connected with my first wife and we moved to england. She was an actress, I wanted to get into the gurdjieff work and they're the first, the first nonfiction book, the case for astrology showed up and that's how I got into smaller. So that's about the late sixties when I got interested in, you know, when I really, when I really got interested in all of this stuff. Anyway.

Speaker 5:          01:44:27       Anyway, the, the uh, but I always had this idea because I had enough experiences with, you know, with hollywood and um, and you know, the film, the film industry and, and even the apical side of things and that you know, that the, the producer's own you and to get anything that's really original, done the way that you wanted done is next to impossible. and I had this idea that somehow or another micro financing projects of you couldn't do it in those days. I mean, how are you going to send out a billion mailings or anything like that. But now with the, with the internet, you can get to these huge databases. And so and so now we've got, we're putting in place a and micro financing aspect of it. And actually I have, I've always been good at thinking up good marketing ideas and just never do them.

Speaker 2:          01:45:28       well john just get on twitter, you need to get on twitter and then get a kickstarter accounts.

Speaker 5:          01:45:33       Well, but what we're doing, and I'm going to talk about it now, it's not yet a promise because we have to make sure the lawyers that it's legal, but we think it's legal. We pretty sure it couldn't be illegal, but we have a cool. I came up with a really cool incentive offer, which is that if you put in, if you get on it for a $50 donation and you can split it, you know, you guys can put it in five each and one of them is going to win. That'S what you put in 50 bucks and that buys you a ticket to effectively a raffle. And when, when we get up to 50,000, we got up to $50,000. We have the drawing and somebody wins a free trip to Egypt with me. So we think that that's because I'm very interested in getting to the young people.

Speaker 5:          01:46:23       Actually, you know, people my age will mostly people my age anyway, but, but um, but I'm particularly interested in getting this message to young people and you know, 50 bucks for some people is, is a lot, but it isn't really a lot of figure it out. I mean, what's 50 bucks? It's 10 beers that are not very good bar or a meal. The tool, they're not very good restaurants. Um, anybody can figure it out. Couldn't afford 60 bucks. So we're, we're putting this into place and if you do go online, I think the website is up already. It's ancient wisdom, ancient wisdom, ancient wisdom foundation.org.

Speaker 1:          01:47:04       Now when you go on these egyptian trips, how long did they take

Speaker 5:          01:47:09       the standard is now, I think it's 15 or 16 days. Door to door. Whoa. That was really intense. I mean I'm, I'm talking what's going on now? Those aren't all day long.

Speaker 1:          01:47:20       So it's all day. You talking for 15, 16 days. Yeah. That's got to be exhauSting. Yes, but it must keep you pretty, pretty sharp on egyptian history.

Speaker 5:          01:47:34       Will we? Not only that actually gets that.

Speaker 5:          01:47:42       You see, see Egypt, nobody in America has ever experienced the real civilization, what we have progress, what we call it progress is the antithesis of civilization. This is shiny barbarism. And so Egypt is an eye opener and as I said, I came to it, you know, through arts and great sacred music and through the shop. and then suddenly I realized how important this loves and along came smaller and all of the study, but what Egypt does is that it introduced to them through the symbolist symbolist interpretation which was smaller de lubicz put together. OTherwise it's just academic egyptology kind of like angry actually because you've experienced this fabulous art. you get listened to all this bullshit that that's telling you that has no connection with what you've actually experienced. So, so Egypt, as I often start lectins all by saying Egypt is like sex that gets everybody's attention lives these like sex.

Speaker 5:          01:48:48       Now you can read all about it and I've kinda been fussing and you can look at pictures and that's kind of interesting too. Like until you've actually experienced that, you don't understand anything about it. So he ends up is like that once you're there, it hits, I mean there's no mistaking about it and, and so it's, it's to me it's very gratifying to be able to be, to be the agency for allowing people to have that experience and unfortunately I had originally hoped to have a little business where there are a handful of people who understand symbolist Egypt well enough to retranSmit it, but actually I'm the only one who does these trips. So one other person could. very brilliant lady called normandy ellis, but even that doesn't have the intellectual rigor, the mine, my stuff does. So I'm almost the only show in town, but it's very satisfying to me to be able

Speaker 7:          01:49:48       to be able to open this experience to people. And also invariably the trips have very interesting people on them with expertise in a number of, of disciplines that are relevant to Egypt. So no trip goes, goes by without me, without me learning a lot myself. I mean I send sometimes very important things so it doesn't get tiring and yeah, it's a lot. It's physically, it's a lot of work, but now I'm in pretty good shape for my age. John, I wanted to ask you a question about the more recent idea that perhaps the blocks and the pyramid. We're not cut from stone, but rather made out of a limestone concrete. Have you? Are you familiar with these theories?

Speaker 5:          01:50:39       Yeah. That's the video that's and that's been looKed into like geologists and and it. It's completely untenable and the video should know better. He's a polymer scientist or something of the sort. Shock has looked at this very carefully. It would be as much work to pound the stone into into powder and then put it into molds and you see the stones are all different sizes so you can't do it that way and when you look at the stones you see at the, at the blocks that what's called a new analytic limestone, which has lots of little seashells in it. Looking like the shelves. I'm going to let cockle shells and they're all intact, so it's. It's a silly theory and on the surface it doesn't sound on the surface. It sounds as though it might be convincing, it was convincing enough so that somebody, a friend of mine put together a panel of geologists who don't have an ax to grind. It's not as though there, it's not as though they're egyptologists are archeologists who have, uh, you know, have a stake in the thing. They go there with an open mind to look into it. And shock certainly does. I'm, no, it's not, they're not. And it wouldn't be juSt as much work to do it when they're good, it's the self says it will take a month to produce a limestone blocks and cure it well enough so that you could actually use it. so no, it's not.

Speaker 7:          01:52:07       So it's just silliness.

Speaker 5:          01:52:10       well, that's incorrect and correct. Some things, some things as silly and then see the, the alternative side of the argument is as irresponsible as the academic side, because people get notions in their head that it's all built by alien could be built. My audience. I can't disprove that but, but there is unwilling to let go of their fantasies as the academics are unwilling to let go of what are not fantasies. But other times when they're incorrect, incorrectly develop theories has been that all being in I've been round, solidly disproved like people like ourselves.

Speaker 7:          01:52:57       No, john, there's also an issue with the area underneath. One of the sphinx is pause that a seismic charting has revealed that there's some sort of a, um, uh, a room down there, some sort of a,

Speaker 5:          01:53:12       there is some sort of in the cavity or chamber we don't know. I mean, and edgar casey, one of his, one of his channels, sessions of transits, whatever he called him, said that, not the, it was a chamber beneath this, one of the eight different descriptions of it, but basically underneath one of the flaws of the strengths that contained the secrets of atlantis. Now our seismograph tells us that there is, that, there is a cavity there. But, and this is a question that comes up all the time, um, and they say, why can't they excavate? Well, we're the geophysicists to did this work of in shock was there, but we didn't get named becky who's a geophysicist, you know, who does the, it's like an underground radiologists, you know, the, the seismograph reading that to you or me would be completely meaningless, like an x ray was meaningless to you or made, but the radiologist continue a lot of very precise information from an x ray.

Speaker 5:          01:54:21       So with, uh, with a readout from the seismograph and, and, and the, the, uh, tom to becky sent from this, from the shape of the, of the read out. It looks as though it is a chamber more or less rectangular. It's under about 15 feet of bedrock on top of that. Um, and there is actually a chamber with tom didn't even know about behind the spanx, a rough cut chamber. There's a block and you pull a block away and a little rope ladder. You can go down into this rough cut chamber where there's nothing and nobody had been able to figure out who caught it or why or when. But there is such chamber there. And on the, on the seismograph readout, the this looks the same. In other words, they get certain colors and stuff like that. It looks the same as what you get under the sink. So the becky who put his neck on the line said, well, this looks like consciously like there is a chamber there. The problem is getting in there because it's below what's now the water level, the water table level. So you can't really excavate or you would be an enormously difficult.

Speaker 7:          01:55:40       I go under water actually. You go under water, you mean

Speaker 6:          01:55:44       as you drill? I do a dig into it. You would actually go under water.

Speaker 5:          01:55:47       In theory you could flip down one of those little fiber optic cameras, but if it's all water in there, you're not going to see anything anyway to actually excavate it would mean going in there with, you know, with huge pumps pulling the water out as fast as it came in. And this thing says the stinks

Speaker 6:          01:56:07       be almost impossible. Right?

Speaker 5:          01:56:09       I'm the sphinx is. It would be possible, but it would be dangerous because the sinks, as you know, it was in pretty rough shape as it is. I meaN, pieces fall off that all the time, things like that. So it may be one of these days who knows if the theory takes it takes root and the, the uh, you know, the powers that they realize that it's not good pr among other things to try to excavate it and see if there is anything there. Meanwhile for me, I'll stick with the geology and the other pieces of evidence. I don't, I don't give an awful lot of thought to that, but the seismograph says there is something there. Yes.

Speaker 6:          01:56:53       Have they detected any other undiscovered ruins or any undiscovered? Uh, I mean, areas that they Would like to explore in Egypt. Are they, do they pretty much have the entire area mapped out?

Speaker 5:          01:57:08       Well, they have a complex question. I haven't pretty well mapped out because that I recently, I forget the woman's name very interesting. The satellites flying over a gun. I'm not sure if it's infrared or something that gives you, I think it's infrared photography without that tells you if there's something underground, but the photography only goes, doesn't go that deep, you know, it goes 10, 15 feet something I think. And, and if, if we're correct, if there is anything that's really completely buried, um, it will be deeper than that and, and celebrate. So the photographer, the infrared, whatever it is, I think in the infrared, doesn't let him know about that, but it ought to be there. I mean, look what the spanx. For example, if the head we're not sticking above the ground, you wouldn't even know about it to this day.

Speaker 6:          01:58:15       Yeah, it's true, right?

Speaker 5:          01:58:17       Yeah. But you wouldn't know. It was just being sad. And then why would anyone bother? But the, with, with these different new technologies, certainly ground penetrating radar and seismographs will tell you if there's anything there, but they're expensive and not. You've got thousands of miles of desert and this is a slow process. Whereas a flyover tells you a lot. Something. Know that there's, that. There's that, there are lots of varied sites, but if they're that close to the surface, the chances that they, that they're going to, they're going to support the ancient, you know, what we call it, a lost civilization. Hypothesis was not necessarily commanding and from art for our purposes, it doesn't even matter because we have, we have enough to go by anyway. I mean go back tap night and probably this easter island stuff and the magical bracelet and certain of the other things there, a megalithic sites in sardinia, which I'm not to be believed and nobody even knows about this.

Speaker 5:          01:59:27       A treasure trove of megalithic sites. So I didn't, you know. Yeah, they didn't just invent sardines. This as this wonderful architecture there, these huge beehive shaped stone buildings that are really amazing. So we don't need that. All we need is the, all we need is the, is the financing to do our, to, you know, to do our, our, our, our, our followup to the mystery of the slangs. And ideally what we want to do really is to get it into the theaters and then go into tv. And uh, and um, you know, in the web and all of that stuff, right?

Speaker 6:          02:00:08       Well you see if something has a high impact, but if you see a lot of the video, like viral videos that have been released online that have gotten millions and millions and millions of viewers just by word of mouth, I really think that video on demand as well as a, as another great option.

Speaker 5:          02:00:29       Yeah, it is a great option. The problem of course is, as you must know this, I mean, do you have ads on, on the show?

Speaker 6:          02:00:37       Yeah, we do. Yeah. The ones that we know, you don't see any ads, we just do them at the beginning of the broadcast, but the fleshlight add on the, on it, the nootropics ad does. Those are the ones that we do. We do those and that's it. And then we have some, there's some other sponsors that we're working with in the near future, but they're all done just by me talking.

Speaker 5:          02:00:56       Okay. Really? I mean because I'm blabbering on here forever and there's no ads.

Speaker 6:          02:01:01       No, we don't have to have ads. We don't have to break any of the conversation now. That's the beautiful thing about it. We get it over with him beginning. We mentioned the the. We thank the sponsors again at the end and it'll allows a full two hour intensive conversation and especially something about ancient Egypt I think demands that it's such a. It's such a complex sort of a situation to try to figure out how the conventional wisdom is saying that when, when did they believe languages invented about 50,000 years ago, something along those lines.

Speaker 5:          02:01:28       They don't even know. Just guesswork. Right. It really is guesswork when you get back. That's the only thing that you couldn't see couldn't say as a trend is that the more they study, the further back everything goes and not only the further back in terms of time with a further back in time in terms of sophistication and see. I mean actually look, go beckley cafe, which is. I mean I hope, I hope you find some photos to or I'll send them to you so to intersperse with with this talk so that people can actually see what else?

Speaker 6:          02:02:10       Well, I think a lot of people google along with the show, so that's probably what a lot of people are doing right now, but go back

Speaker 5:          02:02:16       still if that's. Oh, that's fine too. So, so I mean with god beckley tat they were talking about 10,000 bc now you know, that's five times the span of time from jesus and julius caesar to us. Pretty crazy.

Speaker 6:          02:02:33       That's pretty crazy. Wrap your head around that

Speaker 5:          02:02:36       show. Day. The cave that she'll bang. That's $30,000. That's three times the time from going back from attempt. So you'll see it means that we have this totally skewed vision of our human civilization and of ourselves basically, you know, it's fucking lunatic. Asylum is not, it's not civilization. Who in their right mind would invent the bobble head doll put on american idol or the reality shows this is insanity.

Speaker 6:          02:03:12       It isn't insanity, but it's a channel a division achieved and incredibly high technological level of success. We, it seems to be a technology of a civilization as opposed to what Egypt was, which was we don't know.

Speaker 5:          02:03:27       That's what makes traveling there so interesting because they also had a technology, I mean in certain cases we couldn't build the pyramids or maybe we could, but it would would probably be more expensive than a than a space program and they did it evidently with these

Speaker 6:          02:03:50       and they did it in an era where we don't even attribute them to having metal tools. They had bras that are not even the hopper

Speaker 5:          02:03:57       and you say, I don't know, to me there's not much emotional impact from the bottle. Had dull where disney land for that matter and if you walk into the egyptian temples and then this happens on the trips all the time because I just said it's like sex. You don't tell you the experience that you really don't know. Let us, like we go into these temples and on my trips now it's easy business practically notes or isn't there? But otherwise I go to a lot of trouble to figure out when to go to places. So the relatively people in there, because it's important, you know, I mean it's like trying to listen to beethoven's ninth symphony and in the super bowl you can't do this. Um, so if you get there and you have replaced more or less to yourself, the emotional impact of these things is, is Breathtaking and I felt bad. You don't get that from walmart's. No, obviously not just garbage that goes on. It's just a faCt that are obsessed with technological rubbish and violence. So of course we stupid vitamins.

Speaker 6:          02:05:13       Our setup is obviously very different than theirs, but we imagine ourselves to be the more advanced. It just that they don't have tv. So we were like, oh, they were fucking idiots, you know, they don't have the internet were like, well they were an advanced, but meanwhile they're capable of these massive constructions. I wanted to ask you about the sarcophagus in the king's chamber and the, the evidence that it had been made with some sort of a high speed diamond bit drill.

Speaker 5:          02:05:39       Well that's, that's, that's kristen's theory that we talked about. I mentioned kristen before. Well we don't know. Chris has seen. Chris has to be, he's not a new age for my his stepson, let's talk to that. It's very good composer and he was talking about all of the new age music and and the the album covers and he said it's all a bunch of airbrushed unicorns and that's become a metaphor, but you don't have to the far out new age kind of way of looking at bad things, but chris is not a nEw age kind of guy and that's his field and he know he interprets it that way except as no. With all of the stuff that we've discovered in Egypt, there's no evidence whatsoever of having that kind of technology.

Speaker 6:          02:06:38       Now this, the idea of the lost civilization is the idea that graham hanCock's idea that you know, there's. There's a missing error that we can't place. When. When do you belIeve that took place in relation to the timeline of Egypt? When was all the information or a good chunk of it last and they had to start from scratch?

Speaker 5:          02:06:58       Well, we don't know because you see there's enough. They're not lots with scattered around so that you can say maybe it was never lost. The was never manifested in this spectacular architecture. For example, I was telling me before about the, the red pyramid of does. Sure that's built over a ruinous negativistic structure, but that megalithic structure is pretty considerable. It's sort of like new grange and certain of the, of the, of the megalithic structures in england and scotland and wales, but you know, this is not nothing. and then this strange stone circle, pretty ruinous called supplier and a b t, a p l a y in, in south western Egypt, west of abu simbel. I'm not far from the, from the Sudan border. Now this is, it doesn't look like much, but even the academics acknowledged that it's astronomically oriented and there's a lot about it that, that, that puts his date.

Speaker 5:          02:08:10       They dated, they academics data to about 6,000 bc. Well, astronomically oriented in 6,000 bc means already that it's investigated. That's astronomy. Not supposed to have this fun of me back then. And then is an interesting guy. He's a friend of mine and physicists and, and um, archeo astronomer who looks at the evidence and interpret it, interprets it in a much more sophisticated ignatian that there, there are indications there were at least there they are referring back to a time of about $16,000 or so, bc, even though the sun circle itself satisfactorily dates to about 6,000 bc. And then we go to the, go back leads epi and we'd go to the bracelet and I were talking 10,000 bc and the bracelet, we're talking 8,000 bc and it shows, hey, these fabulous paintings of horses and rhinoceros. This isn't a bears and lions. That's 31,000 bc. So how much do you need? No, they're probably living in tents. I dunno. I mean they certainly weren't living in condos but. But they had this knowledge and this artistry at their disposal and they had it out a fantastically early time.

Speaker 9:          02:09:30       So we just don't know when they lost all this stuff. We don't know when the egyptian civilization either, whether it was a slow erosion, whether it was a massive decline and somehow or another it sort of coincides with the end of the last ice age. Is that a. Is that a fact as well?

Speaker 5:          02:09:45       Oh yeah. Well we think yes. Because that's when the sea levels rose 300 seat and I mean it's, it's a chaotic time then that's when all of the madness and the will he run our services and all that, have that go extinct. So and shark actually have some very interesting, very interesting theories about not just shot and other people about what made it go extinct and you know, maybe some sort of a plasma strike, like a gigantic, some type of event is pretty good evidence for this. But anyway, it disappears. the sinks, the sinks and go back to happy maybe after that. But if this links is earlier, one of the, one of the objections we always had the nice, well how could this be the evidence of this amazing early civilization and there's nothing else. well, there is something else. There's lots of other stuff. A lot of weathering and things of that nature and nature, but not, not much of it. Spectacular. Go back to the tap tap.

Speaker 11:         02:10:51       That's spectacular. So we don't know. Are there hieroglyphs that detail? Any of the construction methods that were used

Speaker 5:          02:11:01       a little bit? Um, there's, there's one, there's one wall reliefs in nothing to do with pyramids. Know absolutely nothing and nothing to do with these things. I mean the egyptians disks, we are blessed.

Speaker 11:         02:11:20       Nothing spectacular too. That's something a lot of people aren't even aware of. How spectacular those are. Well, there are plenty of spectacular.

Speaker 5:          02:11:27       There's one relief in the temple. Eventful, which is a very late ptolemaic sample of between 250 vc, you know, into roman times, built in stages that shows the pharaoh with a rope around an obelisk sort of pulling it up into position by himself. That's not meant to be taken literally, unless it's a very small obsolescence, but it needs to say is like it gets. So when you see evidence, I don't necessarily like stare in there on the temple walls. Love. You can't really ignore it just because you want to believe that the aliens built everything. So there's the pharaoh pulling the obelisk up when there's a theory developed. It's the one favored by the politics at the moment. I mean even they can't be wrong all the time. And a bio needs of technologists named a lobbying. She, um, which talks about how they take these obelisks which way?

Speaker 5:          02:12:36       Hundreds of tons. They somehow get them out of the quarry. This is really in words, it doesn't make any sense. When we were in Egypt and you're at what's called, it's called the unfinished obelisk in aswan, and here's this block of stone that were pulling out of the rock and they didn't make it for interesting reasons that develop the fault line, but had they got this block of stone out of the bedrock, it would've weighed 1200 tons. That's a big stone. And somehow in fact, they've got an out of the quarry and onto rafts or boats probably in the flood season and drifted down. Denial. Maybe the luxor, who knows? We don't know where it was intended to go and then they would have somehow or another had to get it up into position and according to the lobbying, they did this by pulling it up, gigantic ramp and it was set up in such a way that with a kind of a no, the up the ramp that would come up to the ramp with the with this bottom at the top part and then gradually with lots of people with ropes and you'd be surprised how how precise you can be with lots of trained men with ropes and they would gradually pull it up and and it would go.

Speaker 5:          02:14:02       There was a kind of a deep shaft that was constructed that was full of sand and they'd gradually pull the sand up from under and all of these guys pulling the ropes gradually leave your up into position. Very exactly. Place it down on his base, but how they get the sand out the last minute. When you're there. All of this makes sense, but it's. It's fascinating to try to figure out if this is how it's done. We don't know, but the whole be concise, like did it and it's pretty damn amazing.

Speaker 7:          02:14:37       Well, one of the things I thought was really fascinating was when they had to move some gigantic statues, they had to cut them up and then replace them in a new area. They, uh, they had to like cut giant statues in half. I mean, talk about that in incredible project and what you thought about that just from an archaeological standpoint.

Speaker 5:          02:14:58       That's, that's abu simbel. and it wasn't, it was statues. They were, this is a temple cut into the rock face and the four statues of ramesses, the second were sculpted into the rock face itself. In other words, they were integral. It will not freestanding statutes. So when they built the aswan dam and they would have flooded this fabulous place, they got together a whole bunch of money and $90, million dollars, I think it was. Unesco got it together and they got all of the engineers and what they to do is they had to basically, they had to move a whole so they have to cut around the temple and then they have to cut because the scratches enormous. Sixty, 65 feet high and then they had to cut them into four and move the blocks because they moved the entire. They moved the whole up to the top of the hill.

Speaker 5:          02:15:56       Where were they were they were built into because the water would have covered where they were. So that's, that's abu simbel. And so yeah, they have to cut, but they weren't freestanding. snatches, but still it was a modern, you know, it was a pretty considerable modern engineering thing. Otherwise. Otherwise, an example, there's the statue of the colossal figure of abram says that's the basis of shelly's famous poem ozymandias no, I met a traveler from an land, blah, blah blah. And this is the statute that ways it ruined. It exploded in an earthquake somewhere around julius caesar talk. But, but this, this originally weighed about 2000 tons and they got it down the river somehow. And that's amazing enough, but then I didn't get it off the boat. In other words, assuming that they're moving it in flood season on giant rats, then they've got to get the rafts.

Speaker 5:          02:17:06       We've got to get this thousand ton block off the raft. Move it into place. Well the actual moving it on the flat. There are when you're talking about before, what evidence is there, there's one or two months from the tomb relief showing viewed sledge with the giant colossal statue of feral on it and then lots and lots of men pulling the sledge over the over the land. When somebody in the front pouring something, maybe some water cause slick mud actually is remarkably slippery and you can pull things up. As I said earlier, what you see is what you get. You can't deny that evidence when you see the evidence in front of your nose and say, oh well let's aliens dropping things from helicopters and stuff. Then the evidence is there. That's the evidence. But you've got to be careful about the evidence of there are seeing symbols, but look like alec up their template. Bobby does, but I'm not this complicated subject.

Speaker 7:          02:18:13       Yeah, an incredibly complicated subject now, or no, no subject of ancient civilizations would be complete without a discussion of ancient sumeria and, uh, the, the fantastical work of zachariah switching. I'm sure you're familiar with all that stuff. What's, what's your take on zacharias hitchins ideas that, you know, the annunaki came from another planet for a lot of people don't know. it's some pretty crazy stuff that states that human beings were created through genetic engineering and.

Speaker 5:          02:18:45       Yeah. Well, I, I think actually I'm not and, and I find when wouldn't sits in I, I mean, I can't challenge his translations from the, from the sumerian. Um, it was, I just can't, but they're his translations and unfortunately are the best of my knowledge. I don't know of any of the sumerian experts who bothered to take a look at his work, which is too bad. I mean, it's irresponsible, but I do know that when he's talking about Egypt, he's totally off the wall. Totally. And from that I extrapolate and do not much care for his work. And when he gets into explaining who the gods were, um, that they're, they're alien, they're aliens, as malignant is ourselves, who enslaved the a primitive human rights created the gods of Egypt and everywhere else are really just aliens that have been misunderstood by primitive imaginations. This is really stupid and malignant bullshit.

Speaker 5:          02:20:01       Here's a bit of evidence that one of the egyptian creation myths concerns that the god before there were any gods, the god called attune, who exists before there is existence as it were, and he creates existence through an act of masturbation. He creates the first poll, the first polarization, the first female, and the male is the biblical vests. Well, now This is an ancient alien, and this is a suction suction esque interpretation. What is it that the primitives saw? An ancient alien whacking off behind the trade and decided that this was how the universe was created. It has absolutely nothing to do with. There's another words, the gods of Egypt, from the gods of all other civilizations, including those in sometimes think primitive, represent cosmic principles. They are not people, they are not aliens. They are principles and they are scientific scientists don't like this either, but, but when you look, when you look at egyptian mythology and try to and try to historicize it as it were, you flying the urine, the urine, this is a ludicrous exercise and as far as I'm concerned, the whole notion that we human beings to creators, not searching, but some others did create the cathedral of shotgun and the builders, the temples of Egypt and so on or somehow or another diluted, diluted, primitive, so were who were enslaved by aliens and who then found a way to set themselves free, but remember they're alien backgrounds and commemorated them, and all of this wonderful law contacted this is really stupid and not only is it's stupid, it's, it's malignant, it's malignant in the same way, it's the opposite of that sale.

Speaker 5:          02:22:11       Darwinian evolution, which you know in other words, have it. It deprives human existence of all meaning, and that's in fact what modern science does. Modern rational as science deprives us of any meaning in life, and in fact, they're very proud of it. You should read some of this.

Speaker 6:          02:22:31       Do you? Do you contemplate how we were created or how we burst out from the lower hominids how there's all these other primates running around that we did not sure that we did.

Speaker 5:          02:22:42       No, I think there's no evidence for that. There are lower. They were hominids and then there's us and the further back you go. There we are again. This is a situation ask stuff except it's called science that we have to have had that we have to have had more and more primitive beings that were responsible, you know, that gradually became us being apes and became people. And what do you think happened? We are doing show day and go directly to epic and the snakes and so on. I don't live that. Put two seconds actually actually shotgun. I high up on our list. Um, in fact, one of the reasons I got, I got onto the floor. He did a lot of times. Um, funny story that call I got hold of shock because I developed the, I developed the strength theory all on my own.

Speaker 5:          02:23:36       I'm not a geologist and several months in the in the library's working out the geology and convinced myself, let's put together the whole theory of the water weathering and then it just sat there for 10 years a serpent and this guy was published and whenever it was when 79, something like that and nobody paid any attention to it. And then I had a friend who'd been teaching english at cairo and american university in cairo and he was very interested. he got ahold of my work, was very interested and one day we were having not taught at boston university and one day we're having a dinner and he said, you know, this symbolist Egypt stuff. Your instance I think really important as I said. So he said, well, how do we, how do we, what can I do as an academic to help healthier? And I said, they're instantly.

Speaker 5:          02:24:32       I said, fine. The geologist to look into the, the water weathering of the spanx. And I laughed. I said, I knew from lots of experience that finding an open minded scientists and it's like finding a fundamentalist christian who loves his enemies. And, and he said, well, wait a minute, it seems with me anyway, one thing or another lead to robert chalk. And gradually, gradually, at first he did, he was interested in the evidence. He didn't let, he didn't want to even, I wasn't even supposed to know his name. And finally because he was up for tenure and it was, anybody thinks they're looking for a lost civilization. And up here we were up for tenure, not going to get your tenure. Anyway, eventually chalk and I met and as I said, I've been, I, I, I find not evolution. Evolution is a plaque with our windy and evolution by natural selection is arguably the greatest superstition ever foisted upon the human race.

Speaker 1:          02:25:29       Do you believe happened? How do you believe that human beings came to be?

Speaker 5:          02:25:34       I don't know, but I don't know how mosquitoes came to be there. And the, and the. And the darwinian explanation is so explanation is completely untenable.

Speaker 1:          02:25:45       What's, what's our song is that a human beings would evolve through net or progress through natural selection that's on top.

Speaker 5:          02:25:52       That's, that's, that's a lot of the key. See, when we shock, and I, let me, let me go backtrack to when I met up with shock and so it was very, uh, cautious mEeting and mean he was involved with this loony heretic, me and we were getting on pretty well and having a discussion and I gave a lecture. He organized a lecture for me plus the universities to the faculty and interested students and that went quite well. This is what we're talking now, 89. And then I went back to [inaudible] house for dinner and I'm as a subject of evolution came up and he's not just a geologists and geophysicists but paleontologist as well. So he was very into the whole evolutionary hypothesis. And I mentioned the, you know who stephen jay gould was? No, I do not ltl low lee. They died not too long ago, but he was everybody's favorite.

Speaker 5:          02:26:50       Um, he was everybody's favorite sharpies geologist or biologist. He was sort of like the equivalent of carl sagan. You know, he was right. Yeah. Well, he was sort of the carl sagan of geology and evolutionary biology and using the new yorker all the time and all that sort of stuff. And I said the shotgun, we got into carefully answer the whole question of evolution and um, and I said, well, what do you think of stephen jay gould? And he's always a bozo. I didn't know that somebody I could talk to realize that this guy wasn't deemed literate, but a bozo. And actually without getting deep into this, because this is, this is our next book after we were at the bridge of sarah, chuck has really into this, I hope, the definitive anti darwin book, not anti evolution anti darwin. And let me just give you a little clue.

Speaker 5:          02:27:49       Use the language yourself. Everybody does natural selection. A lot of this is not science. This is the, the, the equivalent of george orwell's newspeak. It's science fake. If you look at the two words themselves, natural selection is, is, is promoted as the means whereby sings automatically by a series. this is a quote from a very famous evolution, darwinian daniel dennett. A series of lucky coincidence is produces mosquitoes and us and all the rest of it, and this is supposed to be the agency for this is natural selection. Whether we look at the word natural, if you go to the dictionary, even the great big oxford english dictionary that I have, and look up the word natural, nowhere does natural mean accidental or fortuitous. Natural simply means of the natural world, so to say that it's natural means that it's accidental, has nothing to do with the word.

Speaker 5:          02:28:56       Natural doesn't describe accidental, has no nowhere does it come out or suggest fortuitousness, and then you look at selection. This is also selection. Selection presupposes choice and purpose. The roulette wheel does not select the number that the ball is going to fall on. People are selected for the nba. Draft candidates are selected for running for office. It suggests choice. Natural suggests hierarchical order of the most sophisticated purpose, so to call an accidental process. Natural selection is a con job. If they wanted to describe it. Actually. Actually, daniel dennett does a very good job. he says, evolution is nothing but a series of lucky coincidences. If they call the whole theory, the siri of lucky coincidences would stop sounding scientific. We don't know how any of these things developed and the, the much derided, what do they call themselves, the intelligent design people also, they use the wrong a bit.

Speaker 5:          02:30:15       They use the wrong language because intelligent design suggests a designer and then you're talking about god, and of course they're not, they're not going to be talking about god and getting away with it in academic circles. But in fact, if they called it intelligent creativity, that'd be closer to the mark. Creativity is built into the universal structure. It's, it's creativity itself, but we're in the middle of creativity, um, ourselves. So it's very difficult to discuss this particularly because we've been brought up in this, in this paradigm of, of science speak. And actually after the bridge of sarah and shotguns, as much into this as I am, and he's, you know, he's got all the credentials behind them. We're going to do a book, I think called. It's like if I have my wife darwin, darwin, suddenly cycle dddd, edd darwin debunked darwin declawed, darwin dethroned, a scientist and a scholar deconstruct the cargo cult of the west. It's a fraud from beginning to end. It is not science. Evolution is a process. This is. This is demonstrable. The manner in which it manifests through supposedly natural selection is a total fraud.

Speaker 1:          02:31:37       So what you're saying, just to clarify is that evolution is real, but the process of natural selection due to random mutations and something you don't buy, you think there's. There's more of a design element to it all. It more. It seems to be acting and responding in a creative and intelligent way.

Speaker 5:          02:31:55       That's right. In other words, it is creativity. Creativity is there before anything is created. In other words, it's, it's, it's the matrix in which things somehow or another, and we don't know the process evolved, but it's not. It's not. It probably is not random and in fact there's a ton of stuff when you get into this. I have a folder this live on nolan evolution. That's shocking. I will let and I will get into

Speaker 8:          02:32:30       what

Speaker 5:          02:32:31       pretty soon, somewhere along the line that it can't. It can't work that way and the deeper they look, the more they find. I mean, I just had today actually you should. You should write and conquer and get this guys is. I worked with them, steve

Speaker 5:          02:32:54       list that he sends out every week of interesting articles. They were. There was one just today, maybe one of the other science things that I get all the time about the intelligence, the intelligence of plants. We actually communicate with each other and so on. In other words, we exist within the creative matrix. It's not that stuff just happens in all of a sudden there's intelligence. It's that there is intelligence and we are the results of the intelligence. Not that god woke up one morning and said, well, today I think I will create mosquitoes. Is that somehow that it's like imagining for example, do you suppose that the cells in our body have any idea of or my body have any idea that I'm. Here I am talking to a guy called joe rogan, the three hours about these subjects. They don't know. I don't think they know something else that they know, so that's something like us.

Speaker 5:          02:33:59       We're cells in a, in a much in a, in a prodigious let intelligence and directed organism and that's the. That's actually the. Even though you'd never know it from listening to the bologna that the, you know, the priests and the or rabbis and all of these imbeciles talk about this is actually what's at the basis of all of the religions, however corrupt they become with we have a function to perform in the whole gigantic structure and it's, it's hierarchical and it's organized and it's up to us to do our bit to do it. But natural selection is a set. It's a linguistic fraud. It's spin.

Speaker 1:          02:34:42       So this is where it gets really crazy because where did the, how did the human animal emerge if the human animal didn't emerge from lower hot minutes and we existed in this form from the beginning. Is that the supposition? Because they've absolutely proven that there had been loW lower forms of of human beings, other, other different branches of the human tree that that died off neanderthal. For example, Australia. Pithy kiss is a, a bunch of different ones from the past. They suppose where what they call quote unquote early man, you don't buy that. That's early.

Speaker 5:          02:35:16       We don't know where they lived within themselves saying earlier. they're assuming these are primitive beings. When I talked earlier, I mean we, we're going with our strengths and I go back in our shell date, april who produced day and as I said earlier, really are our level of development is an inner thing. You can't tell, anD as I, as I said earlier, using the image of dance as an as say an enlightened society idea that expressed itself only in dance and by dancing experienced the highest levels of creativity. See, this is the thing that most of these scientists are, are seriously defective human beings. They're uncreative bite nature and they distrust their own emotions. london that grants you listened to the beethoven quartets and walk into this cathedral of genre of the temples of Egypt and that tells you a lot, even if you can't necessarily explain it. I mean we, however we are at maybe let's say the car sufis in certain of the, of the esoteric societies, you know, habit that we're there from the beginning, but we're only made manifest. However that happens at a later date. There's absolutely no evidence that, you know, they Come up with lucy or something like that. We don't know. We have no idea what went on inside lucy's art none.

Speaker 1:          02:36:53       But we do know that 65 million,

Speaker 5:          02:36:56       sorry, we do paypal extrapolating, rationalizing. Basically wHat they're doing is they're rationalizing their own emptiness.

Speaker 1:          02:37:06       We know that 65 million years ago there was a mass extinction. There's no flowering plants before that. There was a completely different sort of an atmosphere, completely animals here. What, how, what happened there, I mean obviously if most life was wiped out and the current life that we have right now exists post 65 million years ago

Speaker 5:          02:37:27       following this stuff, which I do every week. There's a new theory about what happened 65 million years ago. We don't know and we, in fact, we don't even know if there were people and there's some pretty good.

Speaker 11:         02:37:42       We still have an instance that dog to settle down what I said, tell that dog to settle down and I'm going to tell him what's. What kind of dog is it? ThIs dude's awesome. It just goes against his dog. We should probably wrap this up too, but I want to ask him about, uh, how many, how many, how many minutes are we in? Two 45. I want to ask him about the stoned ape theory before we take off. Hey, there he is. What's up buddy? Is that a dog? Can see his face rejection greyhound on ancient egyptian ground. Wow. Wow. Your chips to the bone son louie. You know,

Speaker 5:          02:38:24       dogs that got me interested in needs into the goodwill when I. My first short story was published in [inaudible] 57. I went to the island of the visa in the corinthian in the mediterranean. And these dogs stayed secure there.

Speaker 11:         02:38:40       No, I wanted it. They got me interested in needs at the beginning.

Speaker 1:          02:38:45       I wanted to ask you one more question about the development of human beings. Are you familiar with the work of terence mckenna? Yes. Were you familiar with his stoned ape theory? Yeah, and I don't go for it. You don't go for it. For the folks at home is the doubling of the human brain size occurred over a period of 2 million years, which he coincides with the rain forest receding into grasslands and then the lower hominids coming out of the trees experimented with new food sources and eating psilocybin mushrooms. Yes.

Speaker 5:          02:39:17       That's, that's actually funny because for somebody who did a lot of, a lot of experimenting with I Alaska, which I've also done excellent. Um, he's, he's extrapolating and trying to make his experience fit in with darwinian theory and he should know better than that because it was a smart guy.

Speaker 11:         02:39:39       So you're, you're feeling. I'm sorry, go ahead. No, I'm, I'm, I'm,

Speaker 5:          02:39:44       I'm more inclined to think, you know, listen, the,

Speaker 5:          02:39:49       virtually all of the ancient texts talk about a kind of edenic state, you know, and enlightened states that we descended from another word. We start at the top and degenerate. And to me this is not, this is, this is not so difficult to imaGine. I mean this, it happens often that things, the great teacher comes and everything disappears, you know, we tend to think that everything's like technology and it started off with an 18, 92 mercedes and suddenly we've got a 2012 ferrari. But with Egypt for example, it seems to be at its height at the very beginning with no period of development we don't know.

Speaker 6:          02:40:33       So it's Just. So it's such a massive mystery and your all, your years of exploring it have literally got you to the point where you're like, no one knows and not talking about it.

Speaker 11:         02:40:41       Nonsense. Well anyway, talking about it as though, you know, definitive terms. Yeah, in definitive terms, just so crazy. We just, we just plain don't know. But one of the things you can depend on actually

Speaker 5:          02:40:57       is that, who are you going to take your lessons from? The guys who invented the bobble head doll and the atom bomb with the guys who did shots and the temple of luxor and the, and the late quartets. Me, I'll go with the creatives any day because I am one myself. That's it. I'm not.

Speaker 6:          02:41:17       How long was the period between the decline of the old kingdom and the time where they discovered the pyramids, which were, there was no one living in them when they were discovered. When, when, when, uh, napoleon's army marched through Egypt. There was no one living in the, in the, the pyramids like they,

Speaker 11:         02:41:33       where we lost a lot of information as far as anyone knows to live in that area. Then there no one, there weren't. They didn't habit that area. Oh yeah, sure. Okay, good. I mean it was all farmland around in there.

Speaker 5:          02:41:48       They're in the desert with just a couple of few hundred yards below with a sphinx says this valley. So yeah. So it's all farmland and everything.

Speaker 6:          02:41:57       So my point was like, oh, what time did it all fall apart where it was essentially the sphinx and the pyramids and all that stopped being used for what they were were abandoned and then people had to come back to and go, wow, look at what we have.

Speaker 5:          02:42:10       You can sort of put a date in. The egyptian religion died shortly after first, second century add, who was no longer being practiced. Although the knowledge percolated down into alexandria and dispersed around the middle east, the library of alexandria. This was, this was a hotbed of, of intellectual and philosophical activity always. I mean, alexandria was always there, but the actual egyptian religion as such, died somewhere, let's say in the middle of the third century, add letters and said earlier than the hermetic disciplines in alchemy and astrology and magic and number symbolism, neoplatonism. All of that knowledge continued throughout, you know, throughout european civilization. And we know this, the renaissance, the great figures of the renaissance. So we're always credited with, with opening way out of superstition and so on. You know, an answer. Modern science, they did open the way to modern science, but they themselves believe that their own knowledge and kepler discovered the laws of planetary motion. He said, I've discovered the. I really discovered the secrets of the egyptians. It was a given to them that, that all of this, this advanced knowledge was available in Egypt, but it was trawler who actually this is one of his great, great, great, great contributions that human thought, which weiler, who proves that they had no mistaking it

Speaker 6:          02:43:45       and they had it and it came out of nowhere and they had it and it came out of nowhere and there was nothing before and then all of a sudden this incredibly intelligent civilization.

Speaker 5:          02:43:56       As I said, no you don't. No, no. Just too crazy. You keep going back and they keep going back in. The further they go back, all of a sudden they come across something that disproves everything they thought the floor look show gay. This is wonderfuL. This is spectacular art in the cave. How would those people living In that television sets the bobble head dolls, but if you can tank like that, you've got something serious going on inside you and who says they invented it? You see the further back you go, the more tenuous everything gets. Recently, there've been some interesting studies on flint knapping on, you know, in other words, cutting flint to make to make different kinds of tools with this is this is actually a pretty advanced art and they're finding flint tools, very sophisticated tools that go back 200,000 years. Well, what was going through their heads that they're doing this stuff.

Speaker 5:          02:44:58       We don't know what was going through their hearts. They've discovered this is again only the last couple of years that sea travel was going on between north africa and I'm not sure if it was cypress or some of the greek islands. It's either 100,000 years ago or 200,000 years ago. So if you follow this stuff, the more the more that's discovered, the more you become impressed that some kind of advanced knowledge was always there and even that is, is based upon a technological. It's the only way we tend to think a technological assessment of what they know. We don't know what was going on inside them.

Speaker 6:          02:45:41       We don't know how intelligent they were and that the possibility is that they were right for this intelligent from the beginning.

Speaker 5:          02:45:48       Maybe it isn't even a question of intelligence. It's more requests and really a bit of experience. I mean how much intelligence do you need to, let's say it's to be moved like a dates open courts at so you don't think about this stuff. It's just we're brought up in such a way by this, by this Nicholas Church and progress. To think that you have to be able to do complex mathematics and all kinds of stuff in order to be civilized and then even even when even when you have that point of view, the further back you go, you see that they had a cosmology and see that they had a geometry and they had technology to produce to go back, tap in the today. So, so the whole. So the whole darwinian paradigm is exploded. When you take all of those things into consideration,

Speaker 1:          02:46:44       is it possible that the dark darwinian model works? If you just take the timeline way back then people evolved over hundreds of thousands of years and hundreds of thousands of years earlier than we thought,

Speaker 5:          02:46:55       well, that's what they say, but why should it? In other words, in other words, what is there and the what is there and the nature of the hydrogen atom that presupposes that that things are going to get more complicated and sophisticated. Who says,

Speaker 1:          02:47:11       well, we say by our own designs on earth, our own physical, you know, our creations.

Speaker 5:          02:47:17       Should that be accidental? Maybe they're not be, why should there not be, let's say I a plan to adjust this, for example, just as we grow from the fertilized ovum and we go through this complex process of gestation and then we're born and then it's up to us with what we're going to do with our lives and so on. Who says that's an accident?

Speaker 8:          02:47:42       Yeah. Yeah, and we're not acting. I mean, to begin with, how do you Prove that accidents? See these assholes who happened on creativity in them? Are determined, make the world sound as meaningless as they experience it as bland and passionless and as devops, not deliberate

Speaker 5:          02:48:06       because they don't know any better and in fact they hate creative people for the most part.

Speaker 1:          02:48:11       Well, that's one of the beautiful things about your, the, the title of your dvd, magical Egypt. It really is really is and, and thank you very much for coming on the show today, man. You've explained a lot of things in incredible detail. It's been an honor to get to ask you questions because I have been a huge fan of your work for many, many years now and I'm a huge fan of that dvd series and I would love to go eventually to Egypt with you someday. We should do that. We should figure something out.

Speaker 5:          02:48:40       That's to be that eventual you have to do is talk about it and get 10 people from your very, very extensive store of people to go and you can get a free trip.

Speaker 1:          02:48:49       I could do that. we can make that happen. We're going to do it.

Speaker 5:          02:48:52       I say one thing because I have a list of things that I want to talk about. One of them is, I don't know, do you know gerald celente is? No. A trends analyst and he's a very, very interesting guys. A colleague, his name before he, he is working with them is I'm cold writer and executive editor of the trends journal and it's, I mean he's, he, he forecasts is probably more accurate over the last 30 years than anyone else. And we put out, he puts out, we put out, he puts it really, um, something called the trends journal and it's very interesting because what he sees coming up, it was not pretty and these right a lot of the time. And I mean I try, I tried to tell people that it really, because I'm talking the esotericism and the ancient Egypt than the meaning of the real civilization. And gerald waS, gerald is the, between us and we've got really high level people working is a brilliant illustrator and we put out this journal that light we. I mean this thing is coming unstuck in a hurry and people don't individually and collectively prepare florid that going to be unprepared. And so we can add to the trends journal. I think it's a.

Speaker 1:          02:50:20       Are you talking about a collapse in the economy, the end of civilizations, that kind of thing.

Speaker 5:          02:50:24       Oh, the under civilization as we know it, very likely, unless, unless enough people act together quickly and they probably won't. so we buy gold. You've got to get away plan. And who here, where can people get this newsletter? It's, it's a, it's a journal. Look up, go to the trends journal or google up gerald celente, c e l e n z. He's a very interesting guy. He's a real. He's a real slave swelling. That's excitable. It's agony. It's on Alex Jones all the time. The journal, the journal is, is a really interesting publication that I'm very, I'm very proud to be a big part of it. Look it up for yourself.

Speaker 1:          02:51:12       We'll check it out and your website is j dot [inaudible] dot com and you don't have a twitter yet. You find out about the trips and all kinds of other stuff and you don't have a twitter yet?

Speaker 5:          02:51:24       No, I'm on facebook. I know my daughter is looking after it for me.

Speaker 1:          02:51:29       Tell your daughter to get you a twitter. We need a John Anthony weSt. Twitter will populate that very quickly and people could find out about your trips

Speaker 5:          02:51:37       because as I said, we're. We're, we're reviving where reincarnating our ancient wisdom foundation and by the way, I always put a plug in that before we end up because it's. I told you, I mean we're pretty sure I can't be a promise yet that we've got this incentive thing going and if you pull up ancient wisdom foundation.org, there'll be some information about the projects that we're involved in and and I really do believe that that unless, unless enough of us have humanity goes back to recreates the civilization based upon the ancient principles. In other words, we're not going to be build pyramids again or mummify or arrows or anything like that. Look, the principals meet needs, if there's a one issue, civilization is it's based upon the quest for immortality above the notion of the immortality of the soul, which I absolutely believe in, um, and without that, no civilization as possible.

Speaker 5:          02:52:40       So, so the principles upon which Egypt and the other instance civilizations are founded is the principles are eternal in civilization has passed when I said we're not going to multiply our parents again, but without that understanding and without an understanding of where we're heading at the moment. It's funny, a scary stuff out there. A lot of it is valid, but most of the scare stuff doesn't have the, the antidote built into it. And I like to think that that we do. I think like the conversation we just had is one of none of despair but have the possibility of renaissance and light. Not something known as let's say a spiritual doctrine is not something you believe in. Believes is useless. It's not something you do do it

Speaker 7:          02:53:39       well. John. I think also there's just the ability to spread that kind of information knowledge to people and to be able to do it in a forum like this. It's very rare and very new and I think that the internet and this open access to information that we have on it is one of the best hopes that we have for turning this whole thing around and thank you very much my friend. Thank you very much for doing this. I would like to do at any other time with you, we'll we'll eventually have to work some kind of a cruise thing out and we'll. We'll all go down to Egypt and get our minds blown with you. Thank you very much, sir. I really appreciate it. Thank you. Take care of brother. Like that. We'd done that for me, man. Just tell me when we're off skype.

Speaker 7:          02:54:19       Okay. Okay. God for being, man, that was amazing. Holy shit. That guy's awesome. Yeah, that was, you know, I mean there you need a guy who's out there doing something like that to get the kind of information out and just I'm just so happy that he exists.
