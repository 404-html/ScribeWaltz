Speaker 1:          00:00:04       Boom, and we live. What happened? He took your hat off you go and getting crazy. Trying to feel, you know, I want to feel at home. It's that west coast. Marijuana due to hits you hard. Right? That's hard and fast rule. It's no joke. Yeah, it's chemists or whatever they are buying estes fucking science dorks. They've done a good job. Yeah. Jesus Christ. It's not even the same thing anymore. No, it's, it's, it's a uh, it's a, it's, it's Gmo all the way. Yeah. It's like, Hey, you guys tested this on people? Yeah. It's crazy. I'm like, I know you took the seeds out of watermelon, but what the fuck did they do that? I don't know. How did that even happen? I don't know. I just read that a Barbara streisand cloned her dogs. Did you read that or heard about that? Jamie told me like the weirdest thing. She has two dogs from one. That's weird. It made two clones of her favorite dog. That is like the polar opposite of adopt don't shop. Yeah. It's like you can't get any further. Yeah. It costs like $100,000. Oh my gosh, it does. She can't have a different shape. It's impossible. It can't be a different dog. So possible. Yeah, it's a. it's a weird. It's a weird move to fuck man. If you really believed that personality comes from that,

Speaker 1:          00:01:14       if it's the same thing, like if it just looks the same or you don't want it to just look the same, do you know? It's supposed to be an identical clone of your original doctor, so it really kind of would really stupid. What if it's your favorite dog? Shit all over the place. Walking into walls where we've got bad news. It doesn't have an asshole. It just didn't work all the way where we go to the way it looks like 94 percent of your dog and then you know it's missing an asshole. It's 30 percent as smart as your last dog, which is pretty good because your last dog was a genius. Also, there's another dog attached to it that's walking in the different direction, so it's eventually going to pull each other apart. But for now, now you got six to eight weeks with these weird to speak for a hundred grand.

Speaker 1:          00:01:59       You could just go to the pound. The fruit there is. I have a story that I do my act about a pound dog that I had. I had a pound dog. They killed one of my dogs. Wow. Pound dogs are tricky man. You know, you get a dog that's been in like a shelter for a long time sometimes. They were in there for months. They come out highly aggressive and I'm like my, some of them my dog, but I got her. I mean she's 13 now, but when I got her she was a puppy, you know, and they found she was a stray puppy. She's a little black lab, like just wandering in the Bronx and I got her probably like three days after they found her. What age do you think a dog would have to be like, you got to imagine like a certain amount of abuse that a dog suffers early and it's life before it gets to the pound has got a really fuck with his head.

Speaker 1:          00:02:44       Right? I think there's dogs that you get at the pound, you're essentially like taking on and abused organism. It's not ugly. It's not just that it doesn't have a home is that it might've been in dog fights, like I'm pretty sure that mine, either it's family was in dog fights or it was in a dog fight and there's, you know, people around you that are probably kicking you and beating you or. Yeah. Or you're tied up for hours at a time. Like, you know, you have no free. I mean who knows, but I do think dogs can be rehabilitated, but I do think it takes. You have to have a look to even have a dog be a good dog like that. Like I have, I have, when I had my puppy, like I worked with my dog so much and she's a great dog.

Speaker 1:          00:03:24       Like I could walk in New York City without a leash. Just follows me. She's really is. She's amazing. That's amazing. But I worked so hard. And then if you add to that, you have to first like, you know, like a brainwash them or get them over the anxieties they have. Like there are certain dogs that just hate men because obviously in their former home and was an abusive man in the house and you know, they react differently to men than women, you know. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. You mean you never know. A dog can't tell you what it's seen? Nope. I had one dog that I adopted choose too, and she had mange all over her body, like all over her body. And she looked terrible man. And they caught her. I'm eating out of garbage cans in front of this family's house that rescues pitbulls. And uh, I took her in and like within a month she had hair on her body.

Speaker 1:          00:04:14       She looked great. She was healthy, sweetest dogs, sweetest dog with people. But if another dog got too close, she would fuck that dog up there. It was like, she was like, protecting what she had. It was real. It was real hard to have an aggressive like, pound dog yet. And uh, depending on the dog. But it is like the thing I would always tell people to try to do first because I am a big like adopt, don't shop guy. Like if you go to a dog pound you could find some amazing where I got my dog if you go, which like animal care and control in New York City, like they euthanized like 100 dogs a day. Like it's literally just like the dogs are coming in all the time. Dogs with stab wounds, dogs they find in the park half day and then they like, they have five days in that pound and then they're out.

Speaker 1:          00:05:00       So it's like I was when I was there, this is again, like 13 years ago, but when I was getting my dog and I was waiting to pick her up, this woman came in with two rottweilers, beautiful rottweilers and unleashes. And she goes, I don't want these anymore. Oh Man. That the lady behind the counter. It's like, well what do you mean like that? You know? And she was like, I just can't handle them. And then they took the leash and she walked out. And then there were just these two.no, I don't know if they were trained to kill or not. I was going to be like, ed two rottweilers to my test. Yeah, you can't do that. He knows I have no. I knew nothing about them, but I'm like, well, in five days those dogs are dead because they're like four year old rottweilers. I had a doberman that we adopted as when I was a kid and it had distemper and it does. It's a disease that makes them really aggressive in this crazy way that dog turned on us. That's scary. Oh Dude. It was so scary. I was like, I couldn't have been more than 12. I was like, maybe 12 somewhere around then. And this big ass Doberman is showing its teeth

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       and barking and snapping us out of nowhere. It was the sweetest dog before. And then all of a sudden it's on the couch, like looking down on us. And we were like, Whoa, what is happening here? And so, um, they, um, they came and took the dog, I think. Or did we take the dog to the pound? I don't remember what happened or to the vet rather, and then they ran an examination that dog and they're like, this dog is tamper so we just, we've got it with this vineyard disease. Then that's like, you can't have that in a house with kids. I don't know what the fuck they do. Well, I was a kid at the time. My parents weren't having it, but I don't remember. Like, I don't remember too much about it. They send him to the couch. I just remembered that dog on the couch showing its teeth snapping at us.

Speaker 2:          00:06:42       Scary. And I was like, Oh shit. We brought home a dog. He'll full grown dog that has a disease. My, uh, my mom's cousin, second cousin was married to a dude for a number of years who have this rottweiler that was like a psychotic dog. And like at one point it jumped through their bake glass windows in their house to try to get the mailman and got caught. Oh my gosh. Swing the two windows. And was, it was fine. I mean it had stitches and they had to pull some glass out of it. But it didn't impact the dog, that's how. And it dove through a window. It just didn't make it look like it would have killed the mail. It was just because somebody was walking up their porch, you know, and the doctors and that same like almost one time, like my grandparents had a house upstate and they were there, like my brother opened the door and came out and you know, it was just like.

Speaker 2:          00:07:28       But some people just like having like a scary dog. That's not the kind of dog you just want to run at a kid that you don't know. People get killed on it. It certainly can happen, especially if it's like really aggressive with people like that. Like Jesus, that's so dangerous. It's a monster. Yeah. And they're cute, right? Whether it's like 110 and it is those big males, those big fucking frying pan heads. They're giant flatheads. It's funny too because we're talking about like genetic modifications or cloning, but really dogs, if you looked at them historically that they've been that the whole time like Ben have, man has manipulated what they wanted of certain animals and like they've bred the, the, the meanest, toughest ones to be guard dogs and they bred the cutest. Take a piss on a paper. Matt wants to be left alone.

Speaker 2:          00:08:17       Those are all choices that were made by humans by humans. It overtime by continued breeding of ones that were the same and same and same. You end up with like breeds and things like, man, I really like played a huge role in the kind of dog man. Did the whole thing. Yeah, because when they did the genome, the DNA. It's a wolf. Yeah. Every dog is a wolf. Yeah. No matter how big the dog is, isn't that crazy? Think about how powerful and terrifying and Majestical Wolf is, right? I mean it's one of the most amazing creatures in the forest and agree more and we found just the one that was just slightly bitch ass, just slightly bitch ass really come on. And the campfire, Bro, dude, we got free food and he was like, oh good. I can just say, hey man, I like your hair is poking up like this dude, just relax, relax for years.

Speaker 2:          00:09:04       I thank you to alert you look into camera. And then they found a male that was like, that we should make. They figured out a way to get the bitch ass family. They stayed real close to them to fuck each other. She's like, they were like, let's take the two smallest ones and make them do you know? And then they probably dog houses and I bet doghouses changed the game. Like this is amazing. We're in, I'll have to be a wolf. So alleles, extra hair gets covered and not having to hunt every day. It's like, this is great. I want white curly hair. I'm a poodle now. Motherfucker, excuse me. I'd like a perm and fucking with my name on it. They make them like puffy with this amazingly food food dog, but it's still a dog. That dog will fuck you up. Yep. So poodles are ruthless and those things will come out.

Speaker 2:          00:09:55       Yeah. Puddles probably have an attitude to like no one takes them seriously. Like if you had yo, I got a bunch of guard dogs. What do you got? The 90 pound poodles just shut the fuck up. Oh my God. Still a dog thing. It would be so funny if that thing that looked like a Barbie toy, right? It looks like a Barbie Toy. Doesn't even look a real dog. That dog will fuck you up. It'll bite your dick off. But I have to say I feel bad when I see dogs have that haircut, like they have no part in it. You know what I mean? Like they're just jamie showing us a picture of dogs with braids on. Okay, now seriously wearing slippers. Is that cultural appropriation a little. How does that work? A little bit. I feel like it might be there a white dog.

Speaker 2:          00:10:37       They're stealing from Santa Claus, so get the colors. They got Sanas gang colors. Got People just, you know, like what in the fuck is that? Okay, what in the fuck did they do this dog? We're looking at a dog body is a, is a pink snail and I'm not joking. It looks like a pink snail, like a swirly with with hot pink accents. Is that how you'd say it? Stripes and it's back leg as a flower. Yeah, it's fucking preposterous. Spray painted. They spray painted. Ray painted to dog. That dog is dying. That's chemicals. It has green hair too. It says the poodles transformed into pandas. Horses don't do that. You fuck even snails. You've seen the ones that they used. They take certain dogs. They make them look like a lion with doctor Campbell flipped the fuck did they do to this dog? They turned it into a camel.

Speaker 2:          00:11:28       Is so mean. This is just the same abuse. Come on, it says Cindy, the poodle already bad. It's like hitting a dog in my opinion. So city, the poodle. Just as a new look. Every year, a little madonna and nineties. Oh Cindy. Now Cindy. Oh my God. Cindy wacky parents. Oh my God. That's a different dog. Turn this dog into a pan. It's hair white and black and you magic wand over someone's house started like, fuck it, I'm not in an exotic wildlife. Excuse me. You have a camel and a pant in your front yard. Hey Dude, I can't bear. I can't pay your bare family. Dude. They turned it into a horse. This is deal turned digital football player killer. For folks who are just listening, what is the name of this, Jamie? Because we have to tell people about this. It's a poodle transformed in the pandas, snails, cetera.

Speaker 2:          00:12:21       Google that, and you'll find it. It's one of them. They turn it into a bison. Did they put a mask on it with a glue? A mass to attend? These monsters are horrible. What they do, the dog, they gave him a muzzle. A muzzle. Yeah. They put a muzzle on it, so it looks like a football helmet that he couldn't be a football player from the thirties. You know, you had to have one with the face where they put a wig on. How'd they do the Buffalo? The buffalo doesn't even make sense. Scroll back up again. Then brewster, scroll back up to the Buffalo. Where's the knows? Where's his actual head? Oh, so they put something over at Ted. I don't know. Look at that. It looks like they put a outfit on him. Where's his head? Seems mean. This is like extra years. You think they put a basket on them?

Speaker 2:          00:13:01       It looks like this is so fucked up. So now you are aware of Wolf? No, I'm just a dog man. Oh, can I just cocked off? Oh, the last one. They turned it into a peacock. He literally glued feathers to its ass. Asset is just, it's just, it looks like it might be actually just standing there and they have the feathers propped up against the wall. Possibly. Am I seeing that correctly? But the other stuff has done to it. I think that's what the platform night. Yeah. It's unfortunate. Not Nice. Like it just seems like you got a dog for the wrong reason, you know? You know. Go get a fucking Mr potatohead dog doing. How about decorate your house? God Damn Dog, man Christ. I don't know. People are terrible. Terrible. They're gross. Make so many bad decisions, but it's interesting that one of the things that was coming out of South Korea during the Olympics was people were talking about, um, in Asian countries, the consumption of dogs.

Speaker 2:          00:14:04       That became a big hot point issue with a lot of people. Yeah. It's, it is weird that we choose certain animals, that it's okay to kill and eat. I could agree more, man. I think that our, our food hangups are so specific to our country. I think about it all. But a bacon, egg and cheese sandwich is fried pig's ass. Unfertilized embryo and mold. Well that's not true and bold, but what do you mean video but not going to die today. Right. It's an egg. Yeah. Yeah. And it's. Sometimes you ever crack an egg and there's a little chicken in there. I never had that. I've had a little extra things in there. No, I've had like a little grow. Most really? Yeah. Not like a full chicken, but like, oh, that's going to be a chicken. You know, I was in my before I

Speaker 1:          00:14:51       knew that an egg couldn't become a chicken because I never thought about until I had to get the rooster. I haven't been in the hen house. I didn't know were they just laugh all the time. Yep. I didn't know that until I was in my forties. What you got to, you got to be in a forum setting to know that you imagine if you were a farmer, what a fucking asshole you would think somebody is that you offer on your chickens. They'd get someone that didn't know. You didn't know if that couldn't just become a chicken like no. It's like this one things where it's people that are vegetarians, I urge you to eat eggs, eat eggs. It's a free ride. They just coming out anyway. They're coming out, coming out anyway. If you get it, you can get it from a place like just like you can get organic grass fed beef, you can get pasture raised chickens.

Speaker 1:          00:15:37       They do have that. Then pasture raised chicken, eggs. The yolks come out dark. You just got to figure out where to get them to. Not as they're more expensive, but they're not as expensive as meat. Right. I mean, they're really good for it to last a surprisingly long time. It's a free ride. That chicken is going to eat all that stuff on the ground. The bugs and all the worms. If you don't want to kill anything, just eat those eggs. It's good for you. Very good for you. You're fucking amazing for you. God. Damn. I'm anti big propaganda. Do big. Yeah. I can eat eggs every morning. I do. I eat them almost every day. Yeah. Yeah. I just think that it's one of the most Karma free things, like you've got to exchange with these animals. Like I haven't exchange. I give the animals food. They eat the food.

Speaker 1:          00:16:24       They lay the eggs. I'm nice to them. I come into their little caged area. They don't run from me. They'd come around and give him little treats and shit. They're like pets. Yeah. They have this really cool life. They get to wander around occasionally. They get jacked by coyotes. Really? I've had a three, but how? How? How much are they? They're not in a two. At least two. One of them. I'm suspicious that you don't have them in a coop. Man. It's a fucked up story. I've told it before. I'll briefly tell it again. My massive got honey dicked by female coyote. Oh my God. And he thought the coyote was his buddy and he got to know this is, I should say that my gender, gender identifying with this coyote, I did not have a chance to really closely examine it. I'm just being a, it's for the good of the story.

Speaker 1:          00:17:15       This is what I think is my theory. I think it's a littler coyote and I really think it was a female. It was hanging around my house for awhile and it talked my dog and then knocking down a fence and he's huge. And when he got through the fence, he got to the chicken coop and one of the chickens, uh, was doing a thing called brooding. And when they brewed, they, they're convinced that if they sit on their egg that that egg is going to turn into a chicken convinced they just to get like a little depressed to get nutty. And what you have to do when they're brooding is you have to take them off of the nest and put them in a cage by themselves with just a perch. So they just sit on the perch for like a day or two and then it leaves their system.

Speaker 1:          00:17:55       But if you let them lay on it, it'll take like 30 days. It takes a long time. They plucked. But how do you pluck the feathers off? But. So how, how often are you monitoring your chickens that you're like, oh, we got a brooder. Oh, it's pretty. It's pretty evident for the obvious. You look at them everyday if there, if one of them is in the um, the, the, the sandbox where they lay their eggs and cheese. I'm like getting weird when you get near like a little weird with you and the little package a little bit. Like they're not, they don't try to hurt you, but they're like, get the fuck away from protecting what they think is. They think there's a baby in there. It is, it is. But what's the alternative? You got a bunch of Cox in your yard. Just Jack Trends, they're all running around.

Speaker 1:          00:18:38       I'd be watching chicken rape but my backyard 24 slash seven, maybe like once in a while, bring a caulk in to, you know, give them a weekend. And so we need his bird birth control. I don't want these chickens shitting out kids. I could bring in a couple of roosters. I'm willing to make a few adjustments. This is what I want. I want sever the roosters. Vocal cords. I don't want to hear that shit at 5:00 in the morning. Yeah, we know the sun's coming up. He's shit. Yeah. Siri told me serious and um, that would be one. And then uh, make it so as Dick doesn't work like, like his sperm you like, uh, what do you call that? Yeah, give them a fix it job. Just let them bang it out for pleasure. Yeah, I'll occasionally, you'll get one fertile male inch going to stick their accounts.

Speaker 1:          00:19:23       I think a rooster without a voice is not going to be. You're going to have a brooding rooster on your hands, you know, that's going to take what the rooster, you know, it's half of it's identity, man. Yeah. What about what a piece of shit? I am. No, I'm saying like, you know, people who have clipped their dogs vocal cords because their dogs barks team. I've heard of that before. It's fucking crazy, man. That is, it is annoying when they bark at you though. Sure. But I wouldn't say try to get chickens have the weirdest birth control method ever. Oh No. What is it? It's got to be a chemical. Chickens have long known to a time a Jack Sperm after doing the deep wow. That wasn't well established. Uh, what wasn't, was well established was the underlying reason for what's technically known as seminal evacuation. I like how they give us the technical term is now I understand it better. I would prefer it's technically turned, just call it shooting. Just just the just shot. But in a recently published paper, a team led by Oxford researcher, Rebecca Dean, explains that this behavior is in fact, far from random and that the tendency for females to jettison Burma's actually finely tuned mechanism of post Copula sexual selection. Wow. Wow. That's weird, dude.

Speaker 1:          00:20:41       That'd be a weird thing to say, right? Walk into a chicken, chicken, chicken, check your sperm flirt. She was

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       a little like, what would be the like evolutionary advantage. Not that you're a biologist, norma. We should probably stop there. What would be the evolutionary advantage of being able to shoot sperm out? You get a vibe from rooster that he's an asshole. I wasn't consent. I didn't say yes to that tire is bullshit. Yeah. Who knows. We're like, why did he, why did he take me last? You know what I mean? Why? Why did I have to wait for, for other, you know, chickens. I wonder if rooster crows are like, um, like those, that's what it's called, right? A crow when they see the guard thing. So I wonder if he's like national anthems and that some people nail it and some people just overdo it. Some chickens kneel during it like some hands, just like Jesus Christ, we,

Speaker 3:          00:21:37       you're awake, you're awake. We get it the first time.

Speaker 2:          00:21:45       Oh, see, that's the determining factor in when you know, like, uh, Nah, not supposed to be that long. It's a shorter song then you're doing, you're doing a totally different song doing that. You're doing a thing with your voice that can tell you not to do. Yeah. They loved that 100 percent of the time. I wish I could do that thing when I lived in the East village in New York City back like a year or 2000, 1999. It was, it was. It hadn't really been like a, you know, a neighborhood that was gentrified or whatever you want to call it at the time. And there was a lot of roosters in the neighborhood, like these parking lots. They have these empty lots where there were no buildings and people just had chickens and roosters outside. So I would, I was like, I don't know, 22 years old sleeping in my apartment in the West village and the East village rather.

Speaker 2:          00:22:41       And in every morning I'd wake up to a rooster crowing like every morning and then after a while the community started hanging these signs like, are you sick of the roosters? Like, and then I was like, God, they turned it on the dudes who on the roofs, which is not cool because it like those guys lived there a long time and have roosters treated that petitions to get rid of the roosters. Yeah. All these rooster petitions and then over like maybe a year and a half, two years was no more roosters. One of those like, like end of an era things in New York City where people still had like just wandering chickens in an empty lot. It had like could help caps in it and chickens. People don't understand that. How cool that is. I don't know. I don't know if it's like this, it's this weird thing that happens in cities where people come in and take all the culture out of it and then complain like, Oh, what happened?

Speaker 2:          00:23:33       All the culture is like, could you were moved it? You actively came in and removed it? Well, there isn't as much of a suburban environment so you could have kids in a minivan and all this stuff you would have had in the burbs anyway, and now say that though it a problem that it's not like one individual that's doing it. It's like a whole movement of economics, right? It's a movement of economics. But there is a lot, in my opinion of sort of community like activism towards making the community the way they envisioned it to be around. So you end up with a lot of science. There's like, we're working on it. Tomato Co op and you're like, well, you know, now it's, so now you, oh there's tomato cooperate working night and got to get in on that and you know, and then like, so there's a lot of like, I'm not saying that things are doing are bad, but they're definitely, you know, there's, there's just been a removal of a lot of that stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:24:19       And I look, there's this argument about New York City that people go, oh, it used to be better. You know, it's like now, like it was really dangerous. You better. But they're. So there's an up and down to. It's better unless you were the guy that got shot. Exactly. And then there's the other part, which is you can. I look at cities like this, it's like you're always building something on top of something else that was already there. So what to us is like, I can't believe that hardware store went out of business. It's like, yeah, well maybe my grandfather was, I can't believe they put in a hardware store and we're like, the horseshoe guy used to be like, oh, that's really the telegraph guys going out with this is bullshit. You know, like, like it's probably something people felt, you know, anytime you're somewhere first you always feel like someone's ruining it.

Speaker 2:          00:24:58       Yeah. I think we're in a very interesting time and, and in a lot of amazing ways and I think we're learning more about people and behavior I think than ever before. I think we need to give ourselves a little bit of a break in this because I think everybody has this feeling like why haven't we got our shit together? Why haven't we fully evolved and my take on this is that this is a really recent thing like being aware of what the fuck is going on just in general in the general scheme of being in the universe is a very recent thing. Yup. And what we know about life and what we know about, you know, just our own finite life form, how far it's going to be able to be pushed, how long we can stay alive, you know, how, how easy it is to transfer information from Australia to China to fucking England and back and forth and back and forth.

Speaker 2:          00:25:56       Or we're in the craziest time ever and it's all really fucking recent. Really new. Yeah. Twenty plus years if that. Because if you go back 20 years ago the Internet existed but you couldn't like watch a video on it. Like the, to me the smartphone thing is every day I'm like, I can't believe I have this big of my pocket. It's like if you don't remember what it was like to like, you know, there's this whole like vibe where people like millennials don't get it. They're like, I don't know, I have the same attention span is a millennial because I'm on my phone like Deloitte that adults are better, you know, and I'm like, I don't know if I did a US tour in Afghanistan a couple of years ago and I met all those soldiers, men and women over there, and I was like really blown away.

Speaker 2:          00:26:42       I was like impressed this idea that like our best days are behind us, all that stuff and I'm going, I don't know, this is a really impressive, impressive group of young people who are like fighting for the country, volunteering to fight for the country and like coming back here, sometimes wounded sometimes you know, all the things that they risk going there. But then like you meet them and you're like, these are like, they're not like jarheads, you know, they're like sophisticated thinkers and they're like trying to like be a part of something. It's, it's. I found it very inspiring to be around that. Not like, oh baby boy, bunch of bunch of losers if millennials loser. So I was like, she's just awesome. Yeah, there's, we have a soft life now, so there's gonna be a lot of people that are ridiculous and you know, there's always been those people that are weak willed and they want the world to be nerved up and of course pad their feelings.

Speaker 2:          00:27:33       You're going to have that. But there's also more people that have an understanding of like, that's not a happy, healthy way to live your life. Not. And I also think that like reality at some point will always supersede nerf padding. You know, there's always going to be a push back on that where you go look like, I don't want to offend anybody, but you know, and I do agree that there is a movement by the left that really does push, you know, I did a thing, reason. I'm doing this charity event for a, like an urban program for kids. Um, mainly inner city black kids. And I'm hosting with my, uh, my buddy Mike Yard is a really funny comic black dude. And we went to meet with the guys for this charity and they were telling us that, uh, you know, were they have an auction like at any charity, then write an auctioneer comes out and they'll try to auction off and raise a lot of money from rich people to help the program.

Speaker 2:          00:28:26       That's a very basically 99 point nine percent of every charity event I've ever been involved with has an auction segment. The in the dinner, they were like, we're going to have that, but we can't use the word auction. I said, what? What do you mean you can't use the word auction? Don't like it's a sensitive word for, you know, the community. And I was like, and then the yard goes, are you talking about slavery? It's like his head almost exploded. It was like, ah, wait, we can't wait. We can't say the word auction. I'm like, but aren't you hiring a guy from southerby's? Yeah, his card's gonna. Say Auctioneer on it. We're just going to pretend that's not what he's called. And they were just like, we just don't feel comfortable with that word in the room. And I was just going, I can't see.

Speaker 2:          00:29:08       I said, guys, I gotta tell you it like you're making me want to vote for trump. That's what I said. That's how dumb I think this is. I'm like, I'll agree to it because I want to help these kids. But this is one of the dumbest things I've ever heard. Wow. I couldn't believe I was like, can I say cotton? Am I allowed to say like, what other words can I say? That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. You're going to get triggered auctions going to make a joke. Like we're not going to joke around about like auctioning off a black person. Although yard and I probably would have. But first of all, like when you say oxygen, you automatically think of that voice is going to avoid him out of my head when I. do you think they did that with when they were doing that with slaves?

Speaker 2:          00:29:46       I do not think they talked like that. I don't know what their technique was, but I do know when I think of the word auction, I'm not like, Oh, don't say that. Don't say the a word, it's like it's, it's a, it's a new league. It's absolutely accepted. It's a different thing now. Yeah. It's like the word gay. It used to be flintstones gay. Have time. Having a gay time was like, we're out having a gay old time. Yeah. And then it became gay and then you had to stop saying it that way, but just go back to gay happy. Like Flint. No you can't, but you can't. For me growing up was the thing we just said about everything. Almost everything is good. Doesn't matter. Like the only thing you couldn't, you know, it was terrible. But when did gay go bad? I don't know.

Speaker 2:          00:30:28       That's a good question. Went bad after the f word went bad. Did it? Yeah. Was it connecting the two of them fucking gay and they're like, no, no, not fucking. I meant the other word for gay people that they get to the same fact that. No, I'm not afraid to, but I'm just kind of being sarcastic with the other f word. It's like the other white meat. Yeah, exactly. But like that was the and not that long. It was, it was this idea of like if something was stupid, it was gay, like it didn't mean homosexual. It meant like, Nah, don't be so gay. But then you start thinking about, oh, I guess it does. I guess it's offensive because you're saying like that stupid shirt you're wearing is gay listening. Of course it's that way, but isn't it weird that gay took a turn for the worst?

Speaker 2:          00:31:11       Wouldn't you have loved to been at the intersection when gay went bad? Like for. We'll have. Okay. Time. That's gay. Whoa. What are you saying? Like a intersection one overran it. Yep. The main one beat the happy gay it did. Gay took that. They took the word gay and turns it into either a negative like, oh, that's gay or homosexuality. How is it not connected to homosexuality before? I don't know. I don't know if the connection came from the fact that like they're like, oh those guys are gay. And they were like being like. Because they were being like, really? You know, like how happy they were like saying like, well that Guy's gay, Huh? He's really gay. Like a gay is with that shiny shirt on, you know, hey, that liberace was gay and then maybe someone was like, I'll show you the next thing.

Speaker 2:          00:32:04       You know, people like, hey, we gotta we gotta stop. You know what, we should stop with that word. Come up with a new word gaze. A different thing now because I asked the guy to get gay with me and it got really, really uncomfortable. There had to be like a time in between where it was real confusing, right? Where they didn't, hadn't fully establish what it meant yet where people were like, hey man, are you gay? Yes, I am gay. I'm having a gale time. Guys like good. And then guy tackles him in the bushes like, uh, like the word hookup changed. Yeah. Like right around like when I was in high school, but like my dad will be like, Hey, are you going to hook up with your friends tonight? You know what I what? I mean, what do you mean it means meet up with your friends. I'm like, that's not what it means. You know? All my buddies would be in the room like, Hey, you guys can hook up tonight with that. I'm like, don't don't it ever was like, dude, your dad's gay.

Speaker 2:          00:32:55       Don't be so serious. So funny. Yeah. The language shifts occur. I it feel like right now there's more policing of it and there's more people act. I don't know. There's just. There's a lot like the word pushy was, is one of those where you can say pussy anymore. No. People get offended by it because the idea is you're getting offended by the word, but unless you're overusing it. No, no. I'm saying again, what I say or don't say is what I say or don't say it. I take my licks if I have to, but people get offended by it. You know, that's a word now that like if you're, if you're in a hardcore leftist community, you wouldn't say pushing, but you'll still say dick guys being a deck. It's like, well that's offensive. Those communities need a hug. Yeah. It's like they don't need a hug actually.

Speaker 2:          00:33:42       I feel like they need to have too many hugs, you know, and I think there's just too much. I think it really, it goes back to our lives are easy now, so we have a lot of free time to come up with bullshit. We do. It's like if we had to actually, we didn't have electricity or we didn't have like all this ease. We wouldn't be harping on this stuff, but just like you have a lot of downtime, a lot of downtime. So you're like, oh, I'll start a blog. I think I'll start blogging about words. You shouldn't say we have so much surplus that one of our biggest problems is that we eat too much food and we get to big. Yep. That's one of the number one health problems that humans have. Like this is how much surplus we have. Even though I know people have it hard and there's people that are starving all over the world.

Speaker 2:          00:34:27       I'm aware, but just in general, specially in America. Well, what is it like one of our number one problems is people just eat too much and when we have the wrong shit about people starving in America and you think about how much food is wasted and thrown out for days doing a documentary on it, there's no, there's no, uh, yeah. It's just such a strange concept that there's like no in internal desire to, you know, it's like why I get annoyed at the Christian, right? The like, oh, abortions or you're killing babies. What we need to do is have those babies and support young mothers who uh, who support young single moms. I'm like, when's the last time you fucking volunteered to support a young single mom who had a baby Christian dude posted on twitter with the last time you give up a Saturday of your day to take that kid to the zoo?

Speaker 2:          00:35:15       Bullshit. You say it, but they don't fucking do anything about it. You know, it's a nice little box to put yourself in. For some people they think they're a good person because they're a Christian, but like, how much? How much do you really act? But you're taking your day to stand outside. Planned parenthood was assigned. Why not take the day to go help that kid who didn't get aborted and his mom can't feed him? Go. Why not stop by there instead of holding a sign about the devil? A clinic for women. It's just weird. It is weird. It's a. it's, it's a weird thing that you can do it too, right? I mean that's one of the weird things about people is that we know that if we don't do anything and we take care of ourselves, a baby's coming and like if you get the first countdown, like countdown, like it's almost like we agree that there's like levels to the countdown.

Speaker 2:          00:36:00       Like in the first couple of days, no one gives a shit. Just pull the plug, pull the plot, and then every everyone's looking at everybody like you feel, okay, what happened? What happened? Yeah. It's not that big of a deal. It's like would we. How many cells was it? It was only four cells at the time. Like okay for Salads is not a lot of cells and you start thinking, I don't think it really ever can be for sales, but you get my point, a tiny little thing. And then when does it become, when do you decide, decide that's a person I get. I get by the way it looks like one, I don't listen, I get the argument and you know, I, I do think that I have my own personal philosophy on how I would handle a situation, but I don't if you were a woman.

Speaker 2:          00:36:40       No, no, no. I'm saying if I was in a relationship with a woman and she got pregnant and didn't want to have the kid or didn't want to have the at night, you know, at the end of the day we'd have a conversation together and if she was dead set on doing it then we're going to do it, you know, because that. But, but my point being, I do believe that like it's a weird thing to just tell other people what they're supposed to do or not. I do. I feel about gay marriage. I feel that way about everything. It's like, it's, it's a strange thing to be able to dictate to someone else how they, they're supposed to live. Agreed because there's too many people there with that man. Like we got the right doing it through the Christian, right. And we've got the left doing it through, you know, all their, all their movements.

Speaker 2:          00:37:14       And it's like, I think the reason most people are so annoyed in the country isn't like even political. It's like they're just sick of people telling them how to live, you know? It's like I get it. I can't say that, oh, you want me to not have a gun? You hate guns. It's like everyone's fucking stopper. It's like we need like a, just like a national time out for five minutes and we're just learning how to use this thing, man, where we're learning how to integrate society into this kind of communication that we share right now. Just while we're still figuring it out. I did talk about that with somebody the other day and I was actually just doing a set on stage and I was riffing a little bit about how, you know, we talked about the second amendment a lot and the founding fathers didn't know we were gonna have assault rifles.

Speaker 2:          00:37:53       They didn't have the foresight to see that so that we have to rethink what that means and it's like, well, they didn't know we were going to have twitter. Right, so maybe we have to rethink what the first amendment means that no every fucking moron who's going to have the ability to you say stuff out loud, just on a national level, just the Internet. I mean, imagine how easy it was to govern people before the Internet came around. It must have been so much easier to just lie to them, lie to them to have almost no access to the truth and what you get. We get with Walter cronkite tells you, bitch, that's all you get. What'd you get? It's like, it's like the entertainment industry. It used to be like, you want to hear a song? Merv Griffin and Dick Clark will let you know what song was. It can hear, you know, we're on the side of the people that are anti abortion. There's one side of you that has to logically interpret that. If these people really did feel like babies

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       were being murdered, like it was their perspective that babies were being murdered. If you completely ignore that perspective and just try to say it's a woman's health issue like I get, I almost get where their mind is at. I don't think that they should be interfering in anybody's life, especially when something is illegal and fundamentally believe that's what's happening and you could see how that thought babies were being killed up to street. We can't allow this to happen, but what I'm saying, I'll tell you that they are babies and the problem with that argument is it's. It holds some water. Sure. Like you really have to me as if you're going to be a rational person and I'm 100 percent pro choice, but as a rational person, you have to look at what it actually is. If you don't, well then we're playing a game.

Speaker 1:          00:39:22       The game is you want your side to be correct, but the reality is this is a very complicated, weird thing. Yeah, there's like a life in your body and for sure a guy shouldn't be able to tell girl, which you can do. Totally agree with that can't. You can't tell a woman. She has to keep it. People have already aborted babies. There's a precedent for it. You can't tell them what they could do or you can do to support their decision or can weigh in. I think if you're the dad you can weigh in and what you want, but at the end of the day she's going to decide what she wants to do and you just got to agree with it. Yeah, and that's the move. I think you know, it's just, it's a very complicated thing, but like a life form that will eventually become a person is inside your body.

Speaker 1:          00:40:02       What do you do? Like you imagine we had to make that decision. We're lucky that chicks do it because we don't think correctly for that, for that proposition. Now ability to weigh those options, but I do think that the, uh, the, you know, the, when I think about that, I agree with you and I, and I think most issues in the country are like that and that's the whole problem. There's no rationality on either side, right? There's no, no one will. Rational Center, right? Like for example, people will, you know, look, there's a lot going on with trump and Russia and all that stuff. Wait, what have you heard? And then, and then people will post them thing. Yeah. Well, about Obama scandals and then someone on the left, the building, he had no scandals and then someone will list like five scanners. They go, yeah, those were scandals.

Speaker 1:          00:40:42       Like you can't just pretend that like that fast. And the furious thing was good. It was bad. Like if you really like muscle cars, like, no, but you know, that Obama thing where he like, oh, that's where you gave all the guns. They lost all those guns and some of them were used to kill people. Yeah. So it's like, I don't know, like that. What was the logic behind that? They were going to trace them to like Iran contra account. Did you see that movie by the way, scam? Or was it a thing where they were trying to give them guns that they could trace, they could trace and then they instantly can trace because I think that was. I think that was the gist of it. Can you imagine that? That was just really a gun. I mean this is. Some people do think it was like a just an illegal arms sale that happened right under our nose. Will you imagine if that's really what it is? I mean, did you watch that? I just watched it the other night that Tom Cruise movie American made. No, I did not, but I know what it's about. It's the first good Tom cruise movie he's

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       had out I think in a couple of years. Like it's funny because he's that kind of a dark character is not like a hero. He says, I know at Barry Seal story, so he's, you know, he's a, like a pilot who basically like, you know, the CIA was like, hey, you're a really good pilot and we need a guy to like bring some guns to the, it's all the precursor, the Iran Contra thing, which as a kid I remember hearing all about, but then understanding of the federal level, which was us trying to arm rebels, which we've been doing for, we are been loud and against the Russians. We've been arming rebels for a long time. And that's our move, right? Yeah. Big Time Gang. Yeah. And then, uh, so he became the dude, the CIA asked to do that and he was like, you got to pay me more money. And the guy was like, you'll figure it out.

Speaker 2:          00:42:15       And then all of a sudden it became, he would land the, bring the guns. And the dude was like, Hey, we want you to bring an escobar. And his crew were like, Pablo Escobar, we're like, hey, as long as you're bringing us guns, we also want you on your flight home to bring a 1500 pounds of cocaine. And then he was like, I'm not going to do that. No thanks. And they were like a 2000, 2000 bucks a kilo. And he was like, how many kilos at 50? Fifteen hundred pounds. It became like, it became like this insane to wait smugglers smuggling guns in and drugs and guns and drugs. It's a really interesting story. What do you think happens today? Do you think that stuff like that is still going on today? Or do you think that this, when it happened, like they figured out that it was a bunch of cowboys, like ca operatives that were just trying to make some money on the side?

Speaker 2:          00:43:02       Or do you think it's like a systematic? I think that it's like. I think that it's human error. I think that like people, that's why I'm not like a big conspiracy theorist because it's like I don't think the government's organized enough. It's always weird to me when people who think that government sucks, who wants small government, they want the government, the government mishandles everything. They don't know how to do this. They don't know how to do this. They can't magic imagine manage traffic lights, whatever they think the government can't do. They can't do healthcare. They're idiots. They're idiots. Private sector and then they're like, but there's a giant government conspiracy where all the government knows this thing and I'm like, if they can't fucking manage traffic lights, how are they pulling off like a fake moon landing or whatever. It's like, well, when you that kind of stuff, to me it's like you're, you're, you're perpetuating two very different views of it.

Speaker 2:          00:43:49       Extremely competent, clandestine and group of people who can achieve these like dark shadow. We things without anyone knowing or bumbling morons, but they're the same people. They're government workers. So I don't know. I think some CIS or like the story behind going into Iraq is interesting. Like a CIA operative had a theory about what we're been. Osama fucking other dudes so download. Saddam Hussein had a, had weapons of mass destruction. He had a theory and he was an analyst at the CIA and he wrote up this whole document and they read it. They were like, yeah, this is bullshit. Like we have no proof of any of this. Thank you. And he was so mad they did that, that he published it on the Internet, just leaked it to the Internet and then that story got on the Internet and then the dude in Australia who was a spy.

Speaker 2:          00:44:34       No, we're like a guy from Australia and another guy from Afghanistan or Iraq read it on the Internet, came to America and said, I have all the secrets of what he's doing, and he just used that guy's document that he read online and told the CIA and then the guy came in and goes, he has weapons here, weapons here, weapons here, and then that analyst goes, Holy Shit. I was right. Meanwhile he's quoting him his own report, so then he goes back to Cheyney and he goes, we've got this dude talking to the Germans saying all the things I theorized and then that's the guy curve ball. We listen to a dude named curveball. So like that's how the whole fucking thing went down and basically some do tricked us. He actually didn't know anything but it was too late. We like went off the information that a dude read off the Internet from a guy who was mad.

Speaker 2:          00:45:23       They wouldn't take his info, which was wrong, which is why there were no weapons of mass destruction. So crazy. So it's just a crazy. So yeah, I think that shit happens all the time, but I don't think it's, I just think they're sloppy. Government employee are dealing with a bunch of different things for some of them are sloppy government employees. Some of them are not. Some of them are brilliant. I mean there's that too. Like Robert Muller's, there's A. Yeah, there's a ton of them. There's a ton of them that are brilliant, but you're also going to have cowboys. And this is what I think when you find out about these CIA drug deals gone bad. Where did you see that one? Where the plane crashed in Mexico. They wouldn't let them refuel. They wouldn't let them land refuel because they kind of knew maybe they were smuggling drugs and they made him crash and the plane wound up crashing and it had how many tons of cocaine did it have in it, and people like, this is proof the CIA sells cocaine.

Speaker 2:          00:46:10       I'm like, no, it's proved those guys flying. That plane had cocaine. Right. The real question is did they just get too Loosey Goosey? Traveling back and forth to South America, a little too tight with some people that have had a little bit too much money and they realized we could fucking do this so we could do this and no one would suspect it. Well, that's the thing though. Say what the what the five point five tons of five point five tons. Wow. Isn't that 11 pounds 11. How many? How many thousand pounds? 11,000? Yeah. Two Thousand Times. Five and a half. Is that what it is? Yeah. And 11,000 pounds of fucking cocaine. Dude. I tell you, it's insane, but show the pictures of the crash because it's crazy. There's just six of coke, man. I want to say like 2005, six, six, but so the but the barry seal story, was he just a pilot, a CIA operative who's trying to make connections with them, do his mission, which is given to him, which is arm these rebels.

Speaker 2:          00:47:04       So five guys in the CIA have to try to figure out how to arm rebels. So he approaches this pilot that he hears is a good pilot who flies for Twa and he goes, hey man, you're now in the CIA, but he's not really in the CIA. He's not part of this age. Just a pilot that this guy subcontracts. And then he doesn't tell the bosses how he's getting the guns in. So it's. He just made up a little thing. He has his own budget to do his own little thing and he finds this dude. So it's not like barry seal was

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       a CIA guy flying cocaine. He was just a pilot that the CIA told and only one guy from the CIA told it to him and then it's crazy story, you know? And then he's doing it and then he starts making his little side business. And this guy looks the other way because he just wants buried delivering the guns and then after a while, like as it starts to fall apart, the, so it's like burn everything with Barry Seal's name on it. We've never had. We've never had connection to barry seal and entire life. And that's, that's all the coke that they got off. That plane looks like. What size was that for an army. Like if you had like a army troop and like boys, this is your career and it's all rolled up in these giant bags. Is it if so funny though that like that is crazy.

Speaker 1:          00:48:14       People still think a wall is going to work. It's like drugs were coming in on an airplane. Well, just the fact that the airplane was a cia or playing, did they have in the movie, did they have the reason why they, uh, the whole scheme got busted in the first place? Do you know the story? Yeah, I mean, I don't know if it like a spoiler for listeners, but I'll tell you the real story about the kids that were murdered. Uh, the kids that were murdered were, that wasn't in the movie? I don't think so. The, one of the ways this whole thing came apart was two kids were apparently in the woods when they made a drop and these kids saw a drop and they were murdered. They were stabbed and then they lead left their bodies on the train tracks and their bodies were run over by train tracks and then the parents got an autopsy and the autopsy showed that at least one of the kids had been stabbed.

Speaker 1:          00:49:01       Wow. And so something I realized something had happened in New Orleans where the kids got killed. No, it was MENA, Arkansas. Okay. That's the main part of it. Yeah. That's where the drop was. The drop was apparently in Mena, Arkansas. So they killed these kids and then this whole thing happened and then the whole thing fell apart and then people started looking into it and then barry seal's was murdered actually as he was getting to court to testify. Well, he, yeah, he says amazing thriller, like a Tom Clancy novel. It's a really good and it's done well. The movie's done well. And uh, but they don't mention the murdered kid, but they skipped the Mena. Arkansas is the place where they cia moves in and then um, I hope I'm not remembering this wrong, but I think that was the reason why they got busted. I could be, I'm saying in the movie that's not mentioned, creative license, that making a movie, they're like, oh man, I hate when they do that. Yeah. I hate when they do that, when it's a real life situation. Like there's a. Did you ever see that wrestling movie with Steve Carell fuck out called the wrestler? No, no, no. I'm with Steve Carell and Steve. He's the dupont guy. John Depaul. Ah, fuck. What's the name of that movie? Foxcatcher. Foxcatcher never would have gone there. Yeah, that they did that in that movie where they cut out key details. Yeah, well they changed a big part of the ending where Mark Schultz it like this. It's a UFC fight. A famous UFC fight were mark Schultz

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       who is just top of the food chain wrestler, fought this guy, big daddy goodrich who's a really well known MMA guy. Just totally dominated them and in the movie he's fighting some white guy to just some made up guy. They just changed it. It's just changed that they maybe not get the rights to the name or it doesn't matter then don't have that to take it out. I know what the fuck the history of this was. Now if you lie to me about something so insignificant as who the guy was that he fought in the UFC, he takes it out of it. What else are you lying about? A great, but it's just so stupid to do. It's a real story. Did you ever see that movie with Marky Mark and the rock? I'm serious. I should. That column. Marky mark. Um, I think it's marketing.

Speaker 2:          00:51:12       Mark Wahlberg and the rock and it's like it's a true based on a true story. It came out like two, three years ago. It's really good and in the middle of the movie it's one of the coolest things I've ever seen done in a true story movie. They're like doing this absurd thing or like jumping off a rooftop together and it just pauses and then a text comes up and says, this all happened. This is still a true story. Like it reminds you in the middle of the movie, pain and gain was oh, pain and gain. Yeah. Fun. Moving in. Dump or something. I knew it was something like that. Is this the part? Just the trailer. The trailer. Did this a fun movie? It's a great movie. Yeah. Honestly, my favorite movies that he did. It's fun ass movie. Yep. The rocks. Good man. I liked the rock.

Speaker 2:          00:51:56       I love the Rock in the middle of the, in the middle of the movie, they. They pause it and they go. This is still a true story like this happen, which is cool because it like. Because it gets almost inconceivable after awhile. I think the rock is going to be our president. I think the rock should be our president. I think he can pull it off and I'm not joking. I'm not joking either, man. I would never in a serious political discussion in good hands with my patients for real politics has waned it. Look, we're, we're on our way there. You've seen idiocracy, right? We're on our way, dude. I still haven't seen that. Oh Wow. You will love that movie. I know. I would. I, I got salty because when I had a bit that was the same premise of that is about dumb people out. Fucking all the smart people.

Speaker 2:          00:52:37       One day we wake up and uh, all the power's off and uh, you know, no one knows how to turn it back on. That would, that would annoy me too if it was your bed because it's not my bit. They stole the parallel thinking. So it's an obvious concept if you think that people are out, if they think that people are getting dumber and dumber, people are having more kids. It's just, it's inevitable. Yeah, they are. Yeah. That's very true. And I traced it back to the pyramid, like the whole, the whole thing was like that. The smart people just died. And then the one that had done, people showed up at the pyramid and then they just moved in. Nobody lives here. Like the alien culture created exactly that. A bunch of like fat dudes look good. Yeah. The idiot workers, if you just stumbled into it. We built this whole generation to go with the best that's. So that's still,

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       to me, if I had one time in like if you could go back in a time machine and go to one place in history and see something, I think it would have to be Egypt while they were building the pyramids. I would just love to see what that culture was like. It's so hard to tell. I mean you look at all the stone and everything, right? Even if you were standing there automat I've never been to Egypt, but I've been to cheat. She needs on. It's kind of the same feeling you get. Were you like, what was it like, like when, when this place was popping, like, what did this feel like? What was this? These people have built these crazy structures like what was a normal day for them? You know, it's funny, I had the, I didn't realize that. I've watched the documentary about the Pyramids and not the, uh, not the one with the aliens and which one Nazis and what, what, what, what's that one on?

Speaker 1:          00:54:09       Like with the guy with the crazy hair. Oh, and it George Hill. Shout out to Giorgio sucralose and he's like ancient astronauts theorists surmise. Tell people that's not a sentence. Know he's fairly reasonable. When you talk to Georgiou is just a lover of all possibilities. Ufo. That's an hour's worth of a show. They're on like season 11, 89. There was camping out. You know, it's not the first one with like the Nazca lines. It's pretty interesting. But now they're like eight inch an astronaut feared semis, that palm trees, what brought here. But in you're like, just stop. Like, listen man, you finished it. If ghost shows are still on the air, let them be on the air because at least they're showing cool old buildings and shit and stone structures ever be possible. They have a family wanting to go to this. That one ghost man, at least we have some cool rocks to look at where you look at like, you know, what are those giant stones in?

Speaker 1:          00:55:06       Is it Peru? Stonehenge? No, no, no, no, no. I'm still interested in England and in England. Yeah, there's some. There's some crazy structures somewhere in south America that Giorgio was talking to us about and it was one of the reasons why some people speculate that it's possible that some of the things that are constructed that we really don't have any idea how ancient primitive man did were actually constructed by someone from another. Another plan, which I don't think it's any less reasonable than people thinking. God sent like pointed his finger giraffe. You're right about that. You're right about that. Like half the world believes that you're right about that, but it's more reasonable to think that it was done by people because we know people are a real thing and we know people have built a lot of shit. So the. Yeah, this is it.

Speaker 1:          00:55:52       This is the exact structure. These fucking stones there, they're not just cut and placed perfectly, but they're in fit together like a jigsaw puzzle and somehow or another they carved and move these enormous stones and if you stand right next to them, like a, there's some photos of people standing next to him stand right next to him. Apparently they just tower over people. So these were all done, you know, who knows how many thousands of years ago. But it isn't there like a reasonable thing to think that maybe they had technology that is lost to time. Yeah, that's a reasonable thing to think for sure. Like in other words, like if our civilization crumbles and in 2000 years people dig it up. Yeah. And they find the empire state building. But like how'd they do it? They're not gonna find like a backhoe looking at this picture.

Speaker 1:          00:56:38       Look at these fucking steroids and amazing. Go back to the other one with the person in front of it so you can see the perspective. Look how big it is. Shit. So I did not think it was that big. They're so big dude. It looked like a staircase and this was one of the things he was saying like we don't have the technology to do this right now. [inaudible]. Like if you wanted to get someone to go out there and move those giant stones, cut them, place them. I mean we kind of have the technology, but holy Shit, we did take a lot of money. Would it take giant fucking cranes? It would take forever. Look at what they did. They did this whole structure and all these things. You got to get the guys to show up. Think about how it is to like get your kitchen done because I need.

Speaker 1:          00:57:18       I need two more weeks. You know Mike Stone, guys out of town. How long would it take to build something that fucking crazy? I don't know. And so the idea was that aliens came here, built some thing's fucked with our DNA and got ghost. Say Fuck the fuck some early man. Keeps early man. A couple of pokes and pokes. Exactly. And then decide coyote your backyard. I didn't finish that story. So the brooding chicken that was in that cage, she honey Dick my mast if into smashing open the cage because the massive just smashed the cage like she was trying to get at the cage. Like she was like where the chicken was, the coyote, the coyote was and my masters like I got this and just smash the fucking thing and tore it open. And then she was running out the back yard with the chicken in her mouth and hop the fence.

Speaker 1:          00:58:06       And I saw her hop the fence with the chicken in her mouth. I'm like, I'm living in the Goddamn Disney movie. You are. Look at this. I just watched a coyote snatched chicken from the. From your yard. Yeah, that's bad ass. Who was wild? But the crazy thing is my fucking dog standard over there. I was like, asshole, what the fuck did you do? Is it guy? Oh, it's, she's, she's, she's serious. Have fun to pull the kill chickens and animals are handled today. I know you can't really expect much more from a dog. He's like, I don't know. That dude wanted a chicken. So he's trying to help these bill, these stones. What part of the world is it, Jamie? So people go look at it. It's in Peru, Peru. And what's the name of the structures? It's like something tie you. God, I wish I could remember the code district.

Speaker 1:          00:58:48       Costco. And it's. Can't want to try to say that bruce got some cool stuff. Is that. That's not what we were. Just looking at it earlier though, isn't it? That's the whole overstructured that's what it looks like from the top. Yeah, that's what I googled it. And then it's a fortress to holy shit that does look like aliens built it well or super sophisticated man that was wiped out in a disaster. That's more likely. Yeah, but the crazy thing is how quickly then, if that's the case, how quickly then we came from some sort of ape man to what we are now. You know, it hasn't been that long. The, the, the amount. How long ago was that? I think this was built, this shit was built like at least a thousand years ago I think. I don't think they know though. See the problem is if you don't have to get stuff from like something that someone ate or it has to be like a carbon based thing.

Speaker 1:          00:59:37       You can't test the stone. You can test some of the material in the stone or a, you know, like scratches on the stone, like in crevices and shit like that. You can get stuff. But when they're around things that would have been several thousand years of man's advancing at that point a hundred years ago. Right. Wonder because, I mean, I don't know. It's hard to say because I don't know when it was actually built, when do they think it was built? So there's all these theories and then there's these uh, really, um, fringe theories that push everything way, way, way back. And that stuff gets resisted a lot because the carbon dating though, right? So in some, in some cases occupied since 900, 900 occupied since $900. 900, somebody moved in. Yeah. And then just said to until about the 13th century. That's a long run. So who, who built it though?

Speaker 1:          01:00:25       Do they know? When do they guess? I think it does it say like what year it was built or as you said, occupied from 900. Does that mean that's when they first moved in indicate the earliest occupation on the hilltop dates to about 900 seat. Oh, okay. So wow. I built it over 400 years or so. It sounds like so more than a thousand years and, but like you know the jewels in years, it's hard to wrap your head around. The Jewish calendar goes back to like 5,700 years ago and I know. So there's no nuts, right. So band has man had a lot of time to get some sweet tech, but 900. Yeah. It's so arbitrary that we started at zero then start up again. If you go backwards and you go into negative numbers, like what's so stupid? So dumb Christians. It's weird how we do that.

Speaker 1:          01:01:09       Yeah. Yeah. I mean even with like temperature, no snapping on the metric system is so stupid. So stupid. Like you go to places Neela Celsius. What's it's those 20 slash Celsius outside. What the fuck is 23 cells if you learned anything by though. I agree. I'm like, so we should. We're all going to die. So we're all gonna die someday. So winter had her shorts. No idea. But they, a lot of them know our stupid shit, which is interesting. There's more sort of a we're, we're like, that's like a real American movie. Like they tried to switch over in the seventies to the metrics and people like, fuck you ain't learned French man. Dude. I remember it. I remember it being taught in school. So I was in school. They tried, they tried soccer too. Yup. Just pick it up now. Just maybe a little heat now. Little bit, little bit, little bit. But uh, yeah. It's funny to me that stuff that like that's Kinda what I love about America is that just like that we're not going to do with that. I'm interested in the rest of the world. We don't give a shit. Fuck. Fuck. The metric system. It sounds fresh. It sounds good. Sounds like a gay sister is made three gay math. Okay. We're Americans. It's

Speaker 2:          01:02:19       better though. I mean it's intense. Why are we doing 12? So it's better and, and, but it is confusing when somebody tells you a metric, you know, they say like, oh, it's a leader like leaders of gas. I'm always aura. If you drive in Europe and you're looking at the, you know, spin on winner and that it has the conversion on there for you. But whenever we, you'd say like 12 inches is a foot. Like why 12? Fuck is that? What is that? Why did you, why'd you arbitrarily. And it's only us and a few other countries that still accept that. Right? What that 12 inches. How many people do that? Do they accept it in Canada? Canada's metric, right. And then three feet a yard. Like thanks. Canada is metric. Yeah, it is. I think most places are metric. Yeah. I have a friend from Australia, my friend Adam Green tree, and he talks in meters.

Speaker 2:          01:03:05       It was about hunting 20 meters on what that means. Nothing like how many football fields. How far is that? There's only two distances. I understand school bus, length of football field. It's the way things have been taught to me. Yeah. How many meters are in a real unit of measurement? Like a real one, like an American one. How many meters? How many feet run that fucking meter? You have a fucking goofy ass. Me that. Yeah, it's a yacht. I want to know what a yacht. Eighty yards. Thirty yards away and that's it. Even when you're in school, the only way they teach you about the distance of things. His stack, school buses or football field, like the moon is 147 billion football fields, you know like that. Now I understand whatever the distance is, but it's always. It's always converted. Two football fields at school. Buses are always right.

Speaker 2:          01:03:53       Yeah. As a student, that's all I remember ever in science. He likes taking school buses and going from here to Australia, you know, and you're like, it's like 97 million school buses. That's true. School buses, that's constant unit of measurement and football fields. It's all. Yeah, it's true. The trick of how far does she live? Like two football fields with three school buses. We could walk. We could. It's pretty cold. It's cold. So how cold is it? Twenty four Celsius. Oh, so a 23 Celsius is probably like, is that like 70 degrees? I have no idea. I literally have no idea. I know a little bit about kilos, but very little. I know the limit is 75 slash 2175 slash 24 slash 75. All right, I'll remember that. And remember that. And that way if it gets to like 30, I'll go, hey, it must be hot as zero Celsius is 32 right? Because they're zero is freezing. Zero is our. That's freezing. Yes. But our 40 below is the same as their 40 below. Do another math trick. It's tough. Nine fifth Celsius plus 32 to nine. Fifth Celsius plus 32. Fuck this. Fuck you. Why do you do nine? Almost. It's almost a half. A little bit under somebody. One of you. Fuck one of you. Somebody. We need to figure out who's

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       are. Who's got a simpler thing that. Who's got a simpler thing? Get the fuck out of here with your. With your fair to mentally switch over to Celsius, but zero Celsius is freezing in 32 Fahrenheit is freezing. Yeah, but it's not just offset by 32 something. Something happens around 40. Below zero. They become the same. I don't know if it maintains for very long or degrees. Get Colder and I dunno. Yeah, I dunno. It just zero makes more sense as the company. It's weird like how the fuck is if our 32 is the Celsius zero, how the fuck is it? The same thing at 40. Below. It doesn't even make sense. It makes sense. Here's another. Excellent. How are you not just adding 30 Canadian, he said gave you the gay. My friend gave me this tip. Double the centigrade temperature. Subtract the first digit of the result and the result and then add 32 to that.

Speaker 1:          01:06:12       Oh okay. Aren't you really? Yeah. So 23. Oh, okay. So 46. And then what do we do with the first digit of the result? There it is right there. So 23 Celsius equals 74 Fahrenheit. Twenty three c plus c times two is 46 minus the first digit. So minus the 4:46 minus four is 42, 42 plus 32 is 74 works. Hey fuck you. By the way, by the way, that's the easy one. But what's amazing to me is like when you meet someone that lets you know like what you just talked to them about math and they can do like math problems in their head and you realize, oh I am a baby math baby. Oh yeah, I'm a math baby. Alright, totally. There's people that were like looking at that going, yeah, that's what you do. That's the obvious thing in my head. 20 slash 74 degrees.

Speaker 1:          01:07:06       I'll have moments where like I had this recently, I was just laying in bed in an insomniac state. Like I offered them in and I was going, how the hell do you do? Long Division, I know it's like I haven't done long division and I and I tried doing a problem and I got it wrong and then I have to read. I was like, Oh yeah. They'll be like, you know, like it was like, it, it, it was, it was confusing and I haven't done it in was the last time you put out a pen and paper to do a long division dude. I barely do the ad. The tip part thing, right? Yeah, just met down. You just double it and it moved. The decimal adding sucks. I put that on my instagram recently. It was a depression to get on into mit in 18, 69.

Speaker 1:          01:07:48       Wow. So it's really just the order of operations. If you can figure this out, let e equals eight and the following equation and there's a bunch of tough. What is it, a numerical value of the equation. Hint, as a mentioned, as mentioned earlier, knowledge of the order of operations will be pretty important here. Scroll down to read the answer. A lot of people did not get it right, but most people kind of got it right. Well, what is it? The answer's 15 to this. Yeah. Are you a well versed in these kinds of equations? I remembered how to do it pretty quickly. That's like a friend showed it to me and I was like, ah, I don't remember how to do any of that. Interesting checkmark. I'm square root, fairly positive. I never learned any of that. Fairly positive, but that's a good example. Like I'm a completely illiterate when it comes to that and that's a cube root.

Speaker 1:          01:08:36       No one knew what that was either a cube root. Oh, second exponent. Jesus Christ. Dude, I could. I literally was just nothing I could do with that. Well, that's what's so fascinating about society and that's why you know, if anybody tells you, and it's not all good, but that's one of the things that's fascinating by society is that there's so many different people with so many different abilities and there are people that gravitate towards that and are wizards at mathematics and there's other people like you and I. they're good at talking shit. Yeah. That guy was guy. We live in a world where that can happen. Oh God, no. I often think about how useless I'll be like if the apocalypse goes down, you're going to be like the dude you want to hang out with, but the apocalypse goes down. I'm done, dude. If the apocalypse goes down, whatever happens.

Speaker 1:          01:09:18       You want it to happen in your neighborhood, so it's over. Okay, Gotcha. Look, if a meteor hits, you want it to hit your house. If you're. If it's an earthquake post apocalyptic. Gosh, society say we both survived it and we living in a shanty town, we kind of. You have skills, you can hunt, you can do shit to do something. I can teach you the things that I know how pretty quick. Bring no value. Let's eat first. You would figure it out after a couple of weeks and fix things. I know how to fix things. I don't know how to hunt with a bow and arrow. You had figured out, do you use a gun ever? You've ever used it? Not Anymore rifle, but I would. It's a. it's a better way to get meat. It's more accurate. You can do it from further away, you know, if it doesn't require nearly as much discipline still requires a lot of discipline, but not nearly as much as a bone marrow donor.

Speaker 1:          01:10:06       It's just cooler. It's harder, it's way more difficult. But then there's other people that use a traditional bow and they think that guys like me are pussies because I use a compound bow. You mean like Lego last bow, like just one Robin Hood. Just like a lot of them use recurves, but some don't even use recursive old school stick bow. Really? Yeah. There's people that like want to make things tougher on themselves. They want a bigger and bigger challenge and you know, it gets into this weird territory. So w like some people said like you should only hunt with a rifle because it's probably the most deadly thing that you could use in that situation. Like so you shouldn't use a bow and Arrow because you're not. You're not using a bow and Arrow because it's more effective. You're just using it. So it's more of a challenge to use.

Speaker 1:          01:10:52       It's like, well, let's have a bastardization of the original idea of what hunting is right now. Some people feel like that, but then other people are like, no, no, it's just a different kind of hunting. If you do it correctly, you have pretty much, you have less likelihood of success, but if you do it correctly, you have just as much of a likelihood of killing the animal. So it's not like it's an unethical thing if it's done correctly, just requires way more work. And, and, and like you said, more skill. Yeah. But if you were in an apocalyptic scenario where we had to go out and get food and you and I went out, I could teach you what you need to know pretty quick. That stupid. No, you know, did the hard part would be learning how to be accurate with a bow. That will be the hardest I want to learn that.

Speaker 1:          01:11:31       I was actually going texted me one day and go, what's a good starter? Bo Got, want to learn how to shoot a bunny. Real good means a bunch of good companies. I use a white. Um, but there's a bunch of great ones. Like Matthew's makes great bows, is a bunch of companies that make recurve bows, those which are fun to practice. Like Dunkin has a recurve. He does, yeah. He shoots him in his backyard. He loves it. That's cool. It's just a fun thing to do, man. Even if you never want to ever shoot an animal and you don't even want to eat eggs and just straight up Vegan like archery's a fun thing to do. It's like a weird kind of a meditation, you know, like something happens when you're at full draw and you're like holding on Arrow and then you release that Arrow and it just sales right into the target.

Speaker 1:          01:12:12       It gives you this weird charge. It's like your, you're doing like almost like a form of yoga with your mind and your body together because like everything has to be perfectly still. And then on the release, if it goes in the right spot, you get this big burst of satisfaction. It's really interesting. Yeah. There's something and you can't think about anything else other than the shop that you're attempting to make. Yeah. You have to keep your eyes on what you're trying to hit. It's really a mind thing going on with archery. That's fascinating. I do think though, a shooting a gun is like that. Not probably not as intense or meditative, but there's something like it when people are like, I don't know why anyone wants a gun. I'm like, have you ever shot one? Really? I mean, I don't own a gun. I mean, I live in New York City.

Speaker 1:          01:12:55       It's not really been an option for me. But uh, you know, like I said, you know, I've been on it. I've, it was when I was in Afghanistan when some of those dudes and they were like, take us to the shooting range and we were shooting all their different ways and again, it was a war zone. So I'm not getting into my, my ethical, you know, not a huge fan of aa or fifteens for 18 year old. But I get why people want guns. I get why people want to own guns. You know, I, I think that's like the argument that it's like, I wish people would just like take a beat and go. I like you just said about the abortion thing. I understand. You feel like it's like that's okay. Okay, so you feel that way and then it's that way it becomes less of a conversation.

Speaker 1:          01:13:31       But we gotta get rid of guns, more of a conversation about like, all right, we just have to tidy, maybe just tidy up a couple of components of it, you know, that kind of definitely have to figure out how to stop people from buying them legally when they're crazy. Well there's something wrong with them. Right. You know, I mean here's a question, how many of these mass shootings were actually done by someone who was in the NRA? Well, according to the people on the right, none. Is that true? That's what I don't know that that's out there right now on twitter. That's why I wanted to ask you if, you know, that could be a Russian Bot for probably just spreading that fake news. Hashtag fake news. But yeah, a

Speaker 2:          01:14:12       see if that's real. Does that make sense to you? Yeah, I mean it's an interesting question. Well, if that is and then it gets weird, like why is everybody attacking the NRA? Well, I know they were the ones who are making it easier to access these guys. They're the ones a cock blocking any legislation getting done because they have paying so much money to these congressmen and senators. You know, if you saw that Lieutenant Governor Delta said they don't, they don't want to. First of all, I got to be honest with you man. Like I had no idea you got like your flights are cheaper because you want a gun. I was like, what the fuck dude? Like I'm just getting ripped off on Delta because I don't own a gun. Like what a fucking bullshit thing where you could actually own a gun. But it was just like, what the fuck?

Speaker 2:          01:14:51       I didn't know the discounts, you know? It was just such a weird thing to find out and now the delta pulled that. It did. I was like, wait, but my passive mentality cost more money is so the thought is that the NRA has made it more easy for crazy people to access these guns and so we did it. It's like, yeah, the idea that like we can't raise the age to 21. Well, if you can go to war at 18, why can't you, I don't know. Maybe raising, I don't know. I mean, uh, it's, it seems like when you go to war, you're getting trained by the military versus when you have just 18 and you walk into a concern and walk out with an ar 15. Nobody taught you how to use it. Literally just bought a gun. It's a strange, like I just, my, my thought on it has always been like why not?

Speaker 2:          01:15:37       Like if you have a driver's license for a car, but then if you have enough to drive a bus or like a truck, you have to get a different class of driver's license. You have to get like a class D or Class C, whatever the next level is. There's different classes of driver's license. Like you can't just go buy a big rig and start driving it around the country. You've got to get a license for driving a big rig, which means you have to go to school, learn how to drive one, learn how to park one, all the things that have fuck it takes and you have to prove it to an expert and you have to talk to her about this yesterday. So why not just have it be that simple, which is you want own handgun, just get you get the class, a handgun license and you take your road test which is low, how to load it, know how to clean it, whatever the rules become.

Speaker 2:          01:16:14       And then it takes four hours to pass the test. It's like 10 written questions and then that's it. And then you get the license and get the gun and it's yours. And then next, next class you. I'd like to own a shotgun. All right, good. A Class B shotgun license. Take the class. They think fine and then you get to like the Ar 15 level and they're like, oh, now you have an instructor looking at the guy. And like, this guy doesn't seem a little, you know, he's got a little bit like of a dead. I here, you know, like maybe we'd all be like, yeah, maybe we'd double check this guy or whatever, you know, like you can, you can get a sense of people in, in that environment or if it's a five question question thing you have to answer, you know. And it's like, what, like what are your hobbies? And it's like eating rabbits alive, you know, you're like, damn man, that guy. They hide those answers though. I don't know. I real crazy person. A real psychologists can spot a fucking crazy person based on how they hide their answers. Psychologist, do you think from the written word? I think that you could divide tasks. I think you could

Speaker 1:          01:17:09       devise a written test where someone will be like, this is an alarming answer to this question because it references his mother and it has nothing to do with this bathrooms or whatever. Whatever. Fucking weird, you know? So I looked at that sounds really unappealing to people and I get that they were met, but that wouldn't be banning any guns. That would be. You can have any gun you want, you just have to like do a very basic rudimentary seven question test and go to a firing range with a pro for two hours and he has to make sure you know what you're doing. The NRAS perspective is they don't want to give an inch. Yeah. Because if they give an inch, they feel like the ultimate is they're just going to lose ground, are going to lose more grounded, more ground. What's the slippery slope for?

Speaker 1:          01:17:46       Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's, it's, it's, it's interesting. Whenever anything happens. Like now more than ever, I think people are demanding some sort of a change. Like there has to be some sort of a chain says 75 percent of the country wants some kind of change. Even trump to raise the age. But it won't happen because the legislation won't pass. It's one of those things where I, I seriously doubt, I'm not saying this is a good or a bad thing, but I seriously doubt if we didn't have guns and all of a sudden guns became a thing and we all had to vote as to whether or not everyone should be able to have guns. I don't think it would have passed. I don't think it would pass away. But it's interesting though because it exists now and now you know, most politicians are in favor of it because some are in favor of limiting it slightly.

Speaker 1:          01:18:40       Well, they got a lot of money. Yeah, a lot of money from the NRA, but it's also like who, and I'm not saying you shouldn't be able to have guns, but who wants us to have guns? Like if you just going to be completely democratic, like what percentage of the people actually want everybody to have guns and what don't. Just out of pure curiosity with no judgment percentage went everyone to have guns. I want people to be able to have guns and what percentage thinks that no one should have guns? Like if you add the site Australia or something like that, all the guns. I think it's a much smaller group of people that don't want anyone to have a gun. Like I don't think so. I think there's probably like 14 percent of the country that thinks we'd no one should have a gun.

Speaker 1:          01:19:21       Yeah. I think the vast majority think we need some new sort of regulations and restrictions. Absolutely. Just reasonable, reasonable restrict. I really don't think anyone is saying. I mean I think that people, it's a right that's embedded in the DNA, the country, whether you like it or not, it's part of the DNA, the country. And like that's very important to day. It just stays that way forever. Well, I think that to me their arguments can be made about this, which is, you know, I don't, I don't think people really understand how everyone, how everyone lives. I think there's so many different lifestyles in this country that like, you know, I think you have a perception of like say like a suburban just outside of metropolis, kind of a mom that doesn't realize that for some people in the country when they dial nine, one, one, it's like a 50 minute response time, you know, like it's not like there's like a local firehouse and they could, you know, like people feel like I have to be able to protect my family because I can't necessarily rely on the police to come.

Speaker 1:          01:20:19       I mean, I, I think that's true. It does happen. Yeah. And I also think that like there's a component to people's fears of like, you know, society on folding and whatever that's perpetuated. But I actually believe that people from the dawn of time have always believed they're going to be the last ones on earth. You know, I believe that, that they're going to live through the apocalypse because I really think it's all about Fomo, fear of missing out. And it's this feeling of like, once I die everyone else should die. So like, cool shit doesn't keep happening once I'm dead, you know, but I really do. I think that people have this instinct of like, I'm going to die with everyone else. It's like, no, you're going to die and then we're going to forget about you and then cool shit's going to keep happening.

Speaker 1:          01:20:57       And it's like, I remember when I left the daily show, I felt that way. I'm like, yeah, I'm like, good luck at the show. Kept going. I was like, oh, they're fun. I, my life has no purpose. You know? And it's, it's that. And it's that feeling of like you want, you want the sea. It's like when a football player, whatever, any athlete leaves a team, they're like, yeah, like good luck winning without me. And then they win the super bowl the next year. I'm like, yeah, you were the problem. Jeremy Shockey, you know, don't think that applies to the apocalypse though. I think the apocalypse is people understanding and knowing in their head that they're fragile and that they're very environment is fragile and they were lucky that it stays the way it is right now. But the more we learned about supervolcanoes, asteroidal impacts, earthquakes, tsunamis, all the crazy shit that can happen to people, the more we realize how fucking incredibly fragile we are.

Speaker 1:          01:21:43       So we're always worried about the big thing that happens because there could be a big thing that can happen if some super volcano blows and there's ash that covers the sun or blocks out the sun and we lose all our crops. It's like a new shortages. It's 100 percent possible. Totally earthquakes. Fucking asteroidal impacts all that Shit's 100 million asteroid hitting the earth or not hideous. It's just up to fucking what's floating around in. Yeah. And if people have been alive, if human beings have been what we are now for how many thousands of years, what is it like? Um, 10,000 maybe. No more. I think more than that. Yeah. I think you're sick about modern humans, modern humans, modern. You want to say like 200,000 years. Does that make sense for modern humans? Yeah, I think that's probably wrong though. I think it's mainly because it depends on what we're calling modern.

Speaker 1:          01:22:34       Like is there a. that's a good question. Yeah. What do we call modern like a, a society that has like an African economy and trade system, you know, systems, trade roads, schools, shelter, right. When it was, what do we got? Stone tools was two and a half million stone tool, but that's like. Yeah, but that's a. I saw an orangutan at the zoo using a stick to try to get bugs. Then the next thing says a modern man is 200,000 years ago. Well, yeah. Okay. But I guess 200,000 years ago they look just like us, but like a homo sapiens pretty close to us. Yeah, I'd be. I bet if you thought a woman for 200,000 years ago, you'd be like, yeah, she's hot. You know? You'd be like, what the fuck do I do? Yeah. That's a long time ago. That's a long time ago. Are you swiping right?

Speaker 1:          01:23:23       What are you doing? I was just looking up. I was just googling piece of information. Yeah, that's a crazy notion when you really think of 200,000 years, 200,000 years ago we weren't even people. We were some, some other thing that became people like, what are we going to become? Yeah. I just feel like, like I like when you go back to 100,000 years, it feels like you're, you know, that's like pretty close to like caveman era. This caveman I, which really crits, not like ape man, but it's like, you know, like super primitive, primitive, but that's modern human I guess. I think that was, that was revised something recently that modern human was like when you have trade, which, you know, like civilization, like the more you know versus the versus the actual body being. You know, I think they used to think it was where Iraq is.

Speaker 1:          01:24:18       I think they thought that was the oldest Tamia that area. Um, Sumir. They think that that was the one of the first real civilizations. They think that was the first day. Well, at least the first evidence of written language. And there's a lot of it there. Sumeria Mesopotamia as in fact the first known complex civilization developing the first city states in the fourth millennium, BC. He, it was around these cities at the earliest known form of writing. Cuneiform script appeared around 3000 bce. Yeah. I like everything OBC now for the Non Christians before current era, like what is weight? Why is it current? What's the, what is that bce? Sneaky Bitch. So that's what it was even earlier than that. I didn't think it was 3000 likes. Five Jewish calendar, right? Yeah. Fifty 700 years ago where they like started keeping track of shit and they had like, you know, so that's what they watch and that's about all those structures like the pyramids and all those different things that you think that there was advanced civilizations that died off and that that's why all those things were there.

Speaker 1:          01:25:23       Well you know about like the library in Alexandria? Yeah. That's one of those things that probably loss of thousands of years, they burned all the shit the Egyptians knew like thousands of years. Like we might not ever figure it out, but I'm saying like just God knows what they had discovered and how we could have stacked our science on top of that. And right now be, who knows, we could be living to like 250 years old for all we know, like we don't know what they knew or how they built that shit. Like it's just like what? That's like total religious move. Too much knowledge in here. Get rid of it. The enemy. We're never, we're never going to be able to convince these people have an invisible cloud band. If they could read these books were burned. This fucking picked out. People had been apparently going back and forth to Egypt forever knowledge.

Speaker 1:          01:26:09       They would go there to learn shit. Yeah. And it was, it was a lush place. Yeah, it was a, a Patra. It was closer. Cleo. Cleopatra is closer to the birth of the iphone than she is to the construction of the pyramids. Whoa. So if you go from Cleopatra to today is a shorter time period than Cleopatra to the construction. That's crazy. Wrap your fucking head around that jazz. That's crazy. And if you listen to Graham Hancock, um, and uh, John Anthony West, this guy was an egyptologist who just passed. They think that it goes back way further than that. They think that the pyramids of Giza might be from 2,500 years ago, but they think there's a lot of shit in Egypt. Giant things, including the spanx that are thousands and thousands of years older than that. Well, did you see that they just invented this new air sonar?

Speaker 1:          01:26:58       Yes. That Guatemalan society in the fucking jungle. That's crazy. My mind exploded all that crazy. Did you see that lost city ofZ , that movie he didn't touch on my. It's a movie I want to watch, but then I watched the trailer and I was like, Moshe Kasher sent me the book and I almost read it, but then I found out there was a movie. I'm like, fuck you go. Let's knock this out in an hour and a half. Huh? For sure. It's not as good though because portia was raving about the book. Oh, by the way, congratulations to Moshe and Latasha from making, making people. Oh, they made a burson testing, but that city of z movie was really interesting because this, these, these people were just the raw cost of raw adventurous. I mean you can get horrible mosquito bites and then go into the jungle, these crazy Englishman and like that to me was what was interesting about that book to try to see.

Speaker 1:          01:27:49       I don't know, I was really well done. So I assume that their version of like what these English scholarly gentleman were like when they were planning out these epic mega trips, but when you were watching it take place, like the way they did it in the movie, you really felt like that could have been how it went down and this crazy fucking guy went just deep, deep, deep into the jungle looking for a lost civilization. Journals and things. Which most of those students did you know it, you have to take, I guess what they're writing with a grain of salt because you're like, I want to make myself sound as bad as as possible for sure. But they definitely found some stuff back to. They went, they found pottery and they found a bunch of different things that the guy colonel pursue faucet. Is that his head?

Speaker 1:          01:28:30       Oh Wow. They think it might be his head. Oh Dude, go to that page. Police. We need to know about this shit. Strange stories, Dun Dun Dun. Yeah. They'd probably killed that dude and cut his head off. I mean that's what they were doing to people down there. They probably got tired of this white dude stumbled around through the forest. Had thing. Yeah. How do they shrink head? They cut your skull out. This is the thing I used to think they shrunk the whole skull and everything. I'm so stupid. I already told you how dumb I am when it comes to eggs with shrunken heads. I thought, Huh? They got some fucking solution. It makes their head shrink up. No, no. They take the skull out and then they take the skin, stitch it all up together and then they do something with it to make it like shrivel up like a put a.

Speaker 1:          01:29:09       put a coconut or something in there. I don't remember. I don't remember how they make it. That would have never in a million years have you asked. That was shrunken head would make and they stuff it. I would have no, I wouldn't even guess. I think they stuff it to kind of looked like the guy that's his head. That's homeboys head. Yeah, they, they, they, they chopped that dude up and did something to his head. Wow. That is so crazy. But what a. But a dark way of approaching other human beings. They have his eyeballs stitched up. They have a rope coming out of his mouth for like a. just a carrying strap. Yeah. So you know, you can put it on your belt. Might be right. They stitched his mouth up though, right? It doesn't look like his mouth is stitched up. That looks like a little bit.

Speaker 1:          01:29:52       Yeah. It's like they made a key chain, you know, that's what it looks like. They got that little loop. They carried that dude around their dick just walked through the forest. It was, it was all for a novelty store in Venice. That was their version of forever 21 little like Hudson News in town with little knickknacks. What a fucked up practice. Cutting people's heads off, taking the skin off, stitching it all up and shrinking it, but yeah, but again, it's like we were talking about food. It's like we got a lot of fucked up shit we did here too. Oh yeah. No. Smallpox on blankets. That wasn't. That's not really fucked up. It's not right. No, no, no. They didn't even know what bacteria was back then that they would just know that they can figure out how to get. No, apparently it's an urban myth.

Speaker 1:          01:30:36       Apparently, depending on urban or rural. It's a wild west. Apparently would happen was just the first European settlers just alone by their presence, killed somewhere around 90 percent of the native America bringing outside disease, all kinds of crazy shit that people had no immune systems for and that this idea that they did it all with blankets would look the is not to say that people didn't do horrible things to the native Americans. They absolutely did and it's not to. Not to in any way, diminish the genocide that took place on the native Americans, but I don't think that the blanket thing was true because they didn't know how to isolate syphilis. I mean, unless they just went to pe patients that had syphilis, smallpox, smallpox, whatever it was. You're right. Not just what I thought I guild alcohol. I thought they just knew. Yeah, I got my stories mixed up.

Speaker 1:          01:31:23       It's a good way to go out. I guess you go blind, sarcastic, but yeah, I just think, um, the, the, just exposure to Europeans killed the great many of them. And uh, there's a guy named Dan Flores that I had on my podcast. It's a, an expert in history of animals in North America. I think I heard that podcast. Fucking guys are genius. He's brilliant. But he was talking about buffalo and that when the native Americans died off and like literally 90 percent of them were killed by European diseases. It's just crazy. And a lot of them that were killed off by Europeans, the buffalo were in hunted anymore. So they grew to these mammoth proportions. So it's his contention that those giant fields of buffalo, that people experience where there was like thousands and thousands and thousands of Buffalo stampeding and cross the field that would have never taken place if the same amount of native Americans had been there previously because they weren't controlling the population.

Speaker 1:          01:32:19       They were the primary Predator because all they did was follow these. I mean that's why they had these teepees. A lot of them would follow the herds of buffalo and they'd peck at it from the outside. It just nomadic culture. Yeah. And they just stayed with the Buffalo. But they also kept their numbers down because you know, if there's several hundred native Americans or how many in their camp, right? They're, they're killing a couple buffalo a day every day and everybody's eating it and then there's no refrigerator. So go after it again, keep following it. So they're basically just eating buffalo and shooting arrows at them and taking the populations down all the time. That's so interesting. It's crazy. I'd never heard it before. He was on my friend, Steve Rinella, his podcast, and he explained it on there. And then Rinella explained it to me also independently, and then I had him on the podcast.

Speaker 1:          01:33:00       Then I read his book too. He's got two books to see if he could find the titles of Dan Flores books. Yeah, I mean it makes sense. One of them actually use a paper. Populations expand exponentially. Right. So it's like the daily America, right? Is that it? Cody America is. His new book is a coyote. America said about the history of the coyote within North America. Dude, it's fascinating shit guys. Genius. Yeah. He looks like he knows a lot about. Like he knows a lot of shit with western animals. Any live. He lives in New Mexico and you get street cred with naturalists. If you live in New Mexico, you know that's a place for. Whereas a lot of dudes that have a gray ponytails. Yeah, like a lot of great dudes going a little new agey, a little, a little scary. A little new age. Santa Fe. That's where tate's from tape.

Speaker 1:          01:33:44       Fletcher's from their co owner of caveman coffee. Simply delicious and really pumps you up. Well played. Thank you. No, I've never had one. It was caveman, nitro. Um, how susceptible are you to caffeine? Two hundred 70 milligrams and that motherfucker. That's what versus how much in a cup of coffee? A large starbucks I think is that much like a Venti starbucks. How many times we've gone over this and I can never remember the numbers. I want to say that a Venti starbucks is like 250 or 240 and that's it to 70. It's a touch mode. I don't really need it. Alright Bro. We'll see what scared I don't drink. I thought you were kind of giving me the vibe of like, look, I don't have too many. No, no, no. I just got a new shipment. No, that's not what I was giving the vibe. I just always tell people because I've given it to people and then like an hour into the show, they're like, dude, I'm on crack.
