Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Three, two, one, yes. Dan Carlin. Where ally, what's up buddy? I kick you again. Always a pleasure. Bye. Ooh, all the time. You to me are like this guy that's working on this never ending project that occasionally you release these chunks of these never ending projects, but I look at your podcast has this great work, this long. Never ending like dramatic interpretation of history. That's so exciting and interesting. But when you were talking before the podcast about podcasting, but I don't think of what you do as anything remotely like what I do. Like he was like, you do so many podcasts in my cabinet. There's nothing to it. You start it, you start talking and that's it. You have like preparation and research and you know when you're doing hardcore history that's like a great work. Like you're doing like this thing that's evergreen, that's going to be passed down forever and bit torrent did the fuck out of Danieli.

Speaker 1:          00:01:03       Bolelli had a great line to me cause you know, he does a history podcast now too and he started off by doing just a, a talk. One of my common sense kind of his, and he said the difference with the history one is you actually have to, it has to make, it has to make sense when you're done. I mean the banks, so that's a huge. I mean I sit there like forever and I ended up in my, my wife's never heard it by the way I, my kids don't understand why anybody would want to hear me talk and you know, so, so, but when I come out of the studio and you know, like sweat pouring off me and I'm trying to, and then we'll look at it and it doesn't mean you're listening, you'll hear a mistake and you'll have to repair the mistake and you know, when you're just doing a, when I'm talking on the political podcast and we make a mistake, I'll say afterwards on twitter, all I got that wrong on the history one, like you said, it's forever and so you really have to dot your i's and cross your t's and all that kind of stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:01:49       It makes it a lot harder. Yeah. When you do in common sense, you're essentially just sort of ranting about your thoughts on what's going on and that's a pretty good description. Yeah. Yeah. When you do those and you release them and you find out you made an error, that is a fucking pain in the ass, right? I, I, I, I, I recently blamed one on concussions or brain damage or something like that. So yeah, in reference to Hillary Clinton. No, I know. I said, uh, I was talking about that stuff they throw out of airplanes to jam radars and I called it flash and of course it's chaff and all of course 10,000 military people go, you know, it's chaffed. And I go, of course I know the chaff. I wouldn't have brought it up. It's brain damage. Don't make fun of people who are injured, you know.

Speaker 1:          00:02:27       So, but on the history show, you have to go, okay, I gotta go recut that. Refixed it. I do a lot more editing than I used to. Yeah. That's, um, yeah, it's, you're, you're, like I said like you have a podcast, but then you also have this thing, the heart cast are killing me by the way. I'm going to at some point I'm going to have to just do like one podcast a year, you know, I just, I am the slowest podcaster in the world. I have one claim to fame number one in time it takes to get a new show out. It's not the same. See, that's the problem with calling your thing a podcast. It's an audio show. It is at this point. It evolved into that unintentionally. But you have a podcast too. I do getting longer, longer between Joseph. Well, it's got to be like when I listened to some of your podcasts, like the one on Martin Luther and what was the name of that one?

Speaker 1:          00:03:14       The prophets had to do them. Yeah, that one you're like, I learned about lutherism from you. Like I didn't, I didn't know the history. Right Joe? Let's. But I think that's happening with a lot of people that are like learning about certain aspects of, of history from, from you and from, from your stuff. So a lot of responsibility if billy. So it makes sense that you're spending as much time on them is what I think what happens is. I think originally if you recall that the shows if you go listen to the old shows, they don't sound like the newer ones is because I thought I was just going to talk about funky stuff in history and then people wrote and go, I don't really know the story. Can you tell more of the story? And so you inadvertently start telling the story and then you go, wait, I'm not qualified to tell the story.

Speaker 1:          00:03:56       And so it just. Yeah, it's, it's, it's an interesting. It's an interesting. The way it's evolved and it's also interesting. I was, you know, I warn people when they go and buy the old shows, I said, you know, the old shows aren't going to sound quite the same because they were good by 2007 podcasting standards. But the standards of what we all do are so much higher than when we started doing them. You know, if you grade this on a curve, go to itunes and look at the stuff that's up there with you and compare it to the stuff that was up there 10 years ago. I was competing with kids in dorm rooms 10 years ago. Now we're competing with NPR and I mean all the pro outfits. Yeah, it is the sound quality for sure. But also like podcast, you get better at doing it, you know, you get better at the flow of the conversation.

Speaker 1:          00:04:41       You get better at like being in tune with the person that you're talking to or at least attempting to like that. That's something for people that are listening. When you try to consider like how a podcast is made, one of the things that we're doing is we're trying to express ourselves, but we're also trying to monitor ourselves at the same time. Make sure you're not too overbearing or you're not talking too much. Or sometimes you have a point and you just, Oh my God, I gotTa make this point. But the other person's talking, you don't know when to jump in, but you also have to listen to the person who's talking. So then you forget your point and you're like, fuck, you know, it's, it's a weird juggling act because we're both doing it. Sort of free balling. We're both ad libbing, doing it live.

Speaker 1:          00:05:19       You know what's happening to me now. I'm ashamed to say it, but I was starting to get that, that thing. I'm 59, I turned and I'm starting to get that. You forget the name or you forget, you know, I compare it to a computer. I have more stuff in my computer, but the computer is slower than it used to be. And so I'll have this point where I'll be talking and everything will be going good and then all of a sudden there'll be this really long pause. What I can't think of what, that's where we have to just, you know, if there is a bed and he has to cut out and just eat a sandwich. The two pieces together. While I tried to remember the name of the person I wanted to say or so I'm getting to the point now where I'm not sure I could go live anymore without these really long pauses where I forget what I was going to say or I forget the point I was making or the tangent I was on, so 10 years from now, this is going to be very interesting podcast.

Speaker 1:          00:06:02       It's also deals with the amount of hard drive space you have. I think if you told her remembering things like there's things that I used to know so well just 10, 15 years ago that I just have pushed aside because I haven't brought it up in a long time. I haven't gone into that folder in my mind in the tabs now. Yeah, and if I went to try to pull it out now it's like, no, no, no, we're, we're our space on the warehouse floor is filled bro. There's no room for that. And the bus isn't what it used to be asked. The Bas speed is not what it used to be, but I try to crank that up with this stuff. I'm so much healthier than I am. Well, this is coffee. This is not how. I mean it's kind of healthy, but it's really just speed.

Speaker 1:          00:06:42       Where I come from. Coffee is health food. What? Oregon? Oregon healthiest. Fuck. Yeah. Well there's a couple of people that aren't so healthy in Oregon just in that I'm leading the charge. Do you like living up there in the Pacific northwest? You know, I'm from here and, and, and coming back home is weird because I told my, my wife recently see my kids are Oregonians and I haven't gotten used to that fact. It just seems weird to me and I told her I still feel like this Angeleno up in Oregon, but I've been there 20 years. I don't know. When you start feeling, I mean you're from the east coast to research. Do you feel like you're an Angeleno or do you still think of yourself as a transplant? I've been here for 22 years as long as I've been in Oregon, so I've been here forever.

Speaker 1:          00:07:21       So you feel like this is home. I've lived here more than I've lived anywhere in my life. When you go home with home, when you go back to where you were from, does it feel like coming home or does it feel foreign? It feels weird. I'm used to make me insecure, like I used to go a look where my high school was and I would. It would bring back the feelings of being in high school again. When I was. When I graduated from high school, I would have nightmares that I didn't graduate and I'd have to go back. That's pretty classic. The algebra class I forgot that you didn't drop or whatever. Yeah. And yeah, I felt like I had to go back like, oh no, I'm gonna. I'm gonna fucking have to drop out or I'm going to have to go back to school at the dread of the.

Speaker 1:          00:08:00       And it wasn't like the school was so horrible. It was really like the uncertainty of the future and life and the insecurity and the, just the, the angst that teen angst of, you know, slowly realizing that we're not even slowly realizing but becoming an adult and knowing that it's just a few years away that I'm going to be completely responsible for myself, but I'm completely lost, you know, so there's is unbelievable pressure that comes with going from being a teenager to a time. It's really mean to say unbelievable is nothing to compare to be like growing up a kid in Laos, you know, or you're living in fucking Somalia in the middle of, you know, all sorts of different crisis that are going on. So it's really like the most privileged angst possible. Home. Reasonably the same when you go back to the sea, because I come back here, I told my mom I was reading this. I'm reading this book written by a, if you remember, uh, uh, William Buckley, the famous,

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       you know, talk, talk to his son, wrote a book about, you know, his dad getting old and getting ready to pass away and whatever. And at one point his dad who was in Florida said he wanted to go home to die, which I guess was Connecticut and he said dying in Florida was like contrary to nature. So we wanted to go home where everything was the same. And I thought to myself, if I went home to die home is anything like home was I drive to the places I'm from and it doesn't even know it doesn't ring a bell anymore. The place, if I wanted to go home to die, I'd have to have a time machine, you know, because everything is so different to if every fifth, for those who don't know Los Angeles, like every 15 years, bulldozes itself and rebuilds itself. And so I'm like three generations of La bulldozing from where my time was.

Speaker 2:          00:09:40       And so I go up and down these streets. It looks like a foreign city to me. Now also, the mass exodus of people is never subsided. A lot of them are in Oregon now. Just so you don't mean we've got better restaurants in better theater and everything because of all the California's that go. Yeah. But when I first moved up there, if you had a California license plate that was like an invitation to have your car get keyed. Yeah. Oh, the California's were not popular in Colorado either. When I went to school there, California Californians were not popular. Now I think probably x Californians are like the majority.

Speaker 1:          00:10:08       Yeah. That's the case with boulder. I remember when I was living in Boulder, they said that a lot of people moved up right after the earthquake. I lived in boulder to four years. Yeah. I went to school there. People will like check please soon as the ground starts shaking boulder, um, seven years ago, seven years ago. So there before the podcast for the podcast started. Did you like it? I was only there for a few months. I was there for four months. We planned on living there for a year then maybe permanently. But along the way my wife got pregnant and we were at 8,500 feet above sea level. That's right. Yeah. And it was just brutal. They say that Colorado in general, like around the Denver area has a very high rate of premature births. And low birth weight because of the lack of oxygen I would never have thought.

Speaker 1:          00:10:51       I would've thought you'd have your kid born with like superhuman lungs be like one of those Sherpas in Tibet. Well I think if you live there and you grow up there, probably like if you live there and grow up there. Like I was talking to an endurance runner that lives there and he said it takes three years for the body to completely acclimate where you get all the benefits of training up there. But I have all the Olympic guys. You do the bicycling and everything up there too, just because of the altitude. Well, yeah, that's a big thing with any sort of athletic competition training that involves endurance training at altitude. It makes a big difference, but I think if you lived there your whole life, your body's accustomed to it, you're adapted to it. It's probably fine for your kids because obviously a lot of people who have kids in Colorado, but I think that if you were from sea level like here and then you go there, it's quite a shock to your system.

Speaker 1:          00:11:36       Like you tried to go up a flight of stairs and you're like, Whoa, I'm Kinda remind you. Doesn't mean for sure if you were at 80 something. I mean that's, that's tired and boulder. You must've been out in the mountains. Yeah, we're in the mountains. It, yeah, 85, 8,500 feet above sea level. It's a. But when you work out there, man, it's, it's, it's crazy. The, the, the impact. Like if you're just standing around talking, it seems normal. Like if you and I were having this conversation up there, it wouldn't be any different, but if you had to walk up a flight of stairs or climb a ladder or something like that, all of a sudden you're like, Jesus Christ. I age 30 fucking years in 10 minutes. But anyway, going back to my high school, when I go to my neighborhood where I grew up in, it looks pretty much the same so it hasn't really blown up.

Speaker 1:          00:12:20       But I grew up in Newton, upper falls, Massachusetts, which is a small, like a suburb of Boston. So it's a small place. It's always been small lets you go back there. It's kind of similar. Like I went back to the house where I grew up like about a year and a half ago and it's pretty much the same. Wow. I'm jealous because I go to these websites that say you know, the San Fernando Valley in the 19 seventies and look at pictures and it's nothing like it looks now you have to go to Jerry's Deli and look at those old pictures. They have to. I have books actually had. And this is funny, as I get older, I'd ever cared about La history when I lived here, but now that I'm getting nostalgic and stuff, I buy all these old books with pictures of Magic Mountain when I was a kid in Disneyland when I was a kid.

Speaker 1:          00:13:00       And all those kinds of things. What's fascinating because this area used to be ranches. Oh yeah. Oh. And horse country and having. Absolutely. Well I took my wife back to my high school recently and you know, my high school's turned into like, you know the Beverly Hills high school is when it's like. And so she looks at me, she goes, oh, I see how you were raised, honey. No, it's melt like manure. It was all dirt roads. It was really. It wasn't like that for me. So she doesn't believe me. Yeah. The pictures at Jerry's Deli on Ventura up here, they have these pictures from the early 19 hundreds of these big giant high resolution photos and it's like wow, fields and stuff. Rolling Hills. You could look at an a timelapse just watch it all, watch it all build. You'd be like, Whoa, what the. My Mom's got this view of the entire valley and you look at it and it's full and you see those pictures from Jerry's Deli and it's empty and it basically, whatever it is, 70 years or something.

Speaker 1:          00:13:48       It's full. Yeah. Well, the whole country, if you really stop and think about, I've been talking to people about that a lot lately because we've been sort of discussing how bizarre this, uh, election has been and how recent this country has existed. How recent is recently this country was established. I mean, when you think about 17, 76 and you think about the rest of the world, like this is an insanely new country. Oh, in the west. My, my wife's grandfather died recently. He was 94 and I said, do you realize that two of your grandfather's lifespans and there is no non natives here on the west coast. That's too long. Lifetime. Yeah. It's bizarre. It's really interesting when you think about it that way. How quick this gigantic thing it took over the world. Essentially. I should correct the. See, I already heard it. Hardcore history error in that comment I should say in the Pacific northwest because they'll say, oh no, Dan, they were Spanish missions. And see that's how you get in trouble. Okay. We go three generations. Three generations now. The Spanish were here a long time ago,

Speaker 2:          00:14:51       but, but up in the Pacific northwest, he wasn't like that. There were, you know, because it's funny, you can tell where the tide of, of Spanish conquest sort of broke because you, you, you stop getting those Hispanic names for all the communities and all of a sudden you're like, what happened to Lahabra? What happened to all those wonderful Spanish names and you're no longer in that. Now you're in Russia actually owned a little bit of that territory once upon a time, but now you're, everything's a native American name or, or some name from some really early settler or pioneer or something like that. We were talking about how recently slavery existed in this country. Oh my God, yes. 18, 65. And you think about 18, 65 to 2016 is nothing. Well, and then let's remember that. You know, you still had the Jim crow laws and segregation up until you and I were kids.

Speaker 2:          00:15:38       My mom did a film in Florida in 1972 and I'm not talking about the apologies to floridians out there, but the civilized part of Florida, we were in the swamp. It was a place called Weeki wachee if you've ever been there. The big draw is they have a live mermaid show that they try to get you to slow down for enough to eat at the local cafe or whatever. And so we're in Weeki wachee Florida. We took a picture when we left and the whole hotel staff was out there and it looks like something out of a time more because you realize you're like three or five years of segregation has been gone that long. I mean that's how recent this is. Although I realized the more I talk to young people, even being 50 sounds like a long time ago, but when you and I were kids, that was the tail end of the time when if you were a black person in certain states in this country, you couldn't stay in a bunch of hotels.

Speaker 2:          00:16:26       I mean, that's, that's, that's really recent. Yeah, that's really recent. Um, I had this cop on my from Baltimore, Michael Wood, and he was telling me about the laws that they had in Baltimore, that they had a systematic, they really had racism that was so a part of the city that you couldn't sell houses in certain areas to Bach people. Frank Robinson tells a story about being with the Baltimore Orioles and he says he got traded from the Cincinnati reds, the Baltimore Orioles, and his wife was able to find a house really quickly until they realized it wasn't Brooks Robinson's wife who's a white guy. It was Frank Robinson's wife. And then all of a sudden the house disappeared right off, you know, two seconds later. So, but that's almost a, you know, you don't know what to say about that because there's two kinds of racism. There's the kind where the government is involved in the states involved, like you said, system institutionalized.

Speaker 2:          00:17:17       And then there's, I'm a white home buyer whose neighbors, you know, I remember there was an all in the family episode where Archie bunker or one of the neighbors was going to sell to a black family. And all the other white neighbors freaked out. So I mean that's not really like government racism. That's like good old fashioned one to one racism, you know? Well they used to do this thing called blockbusting and it happened with my grandfather. My grandfather lived in Newark, New Jersey. And these realtors would go door to door and literally tell the homeowners, black people are moving into the neighborhood. You have to sell your home and the property values are going crash. People

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       just. They just started selling like crazy. My grandfather stayed. My grandfather was like, I like black people, get the fuck off my lawn. He was one of those guys. So they, they left in the neighborhood changed. First it became black, then it became Puerto Rican. And then before my grandfather died it had been like a weird mixture of ethnicities, Dominicans and different people from different environments. But it was a really fascinating place to live because there was extreme, there was poverty and then there was a lot of crime and stuff. Like the next door neighbor when my grandfather lived there is a kid who was selling crack and they battering rammed his front door. He had it all reinforced everything. Had An audi in the driveway, like the whole deal. He was just selling drugs and they, you know, broke down as doorway and arrested. I've never thought it was a pretty dramatic moment, but the rest of it was like when you look at like a bad neighborhood, it's not like you go down the street and it's like a war zone.

Speaker 3:          00:18:46       Guns are going off and people getting stabbed for the most part. It's pretty friendly and lively. It's just when you're dealing with poor people in a crime ridden neighborhood, you know, it's just gonna happen more often than it's going to happen in a place that's really nice. But most of the time when you go outside it would be people playing music and there was kids playing in the street and it was people hanging out in their steps. It was really interesting to watch like his, you know, from the time I was a little kid remembering his name, you know, his neighborhood to what it was before he died and it had just kept shifting over and over again. We're new, new, sort of a lower income, disenfranchised groups would move into the area.

Speaker 2:          00:19:28       And you know, this I'm sure already, but for the listeners state, there's a whole theory on how if you look at boxing, you can see, you know, who the wave of immigrants most recent was because boxing became a way for people to get out of the ghetto. And so if you look at, say, early 19 hundreds up into the middle, 19 twenties and thirties, there were a lot of Jewish boxers because their parents had come over on the boat and they were first generation Italian boxers during the same period. Irish boxers. Uh, and then you move to areas where, I mean poor African Americans have always been in boxing for. Because for the same reason, Hispanic boxers, I mean, I saw a whole article once on America's immigration story as told through boxing. And they would suggest that by the time the next generation came along, most of the time the parents had done well enough so that, you know, the kids didn't have to go into boxing, but. But it was an interesting story that, you know, I think it was, I think the article was entitled something like, why don't you see any great Jewish boxers anymore? And it went down the whole list and I didn't know there were Jewish boxers when I first. Oh, Benny Leonard. There a lot of Jewish maxie Rosenbloom. A lot of them.

Speaker 3:          00:20:30       Yeah. There was a, there was a ton of them, the early days. But it's always that. It's always the immigrants first generation people, right? Yeah. Well we've seen a lot now is Russians.

Speaker 2:          00:20:39       Same. Same system though, right? You have, you have newcomers who are trying to make their way into the system and boxing is the best thing they bring to the table. Yeah. It's also that you, growing

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       up in these really hard environments were fisticuffs are much more common and people seek to train themselves to learn how to fight because they're dealing with conflict all the time. Absolutely right. Whereas a lot of the kids in class, you see, you know, America, no bullying, you know, hey, diversity and these kids are growing up and they, you know, they just no desire for the average middle class white kid to go into boxing. It's just no desire. Those of us who've tried it, I tried it once just for the fun of it and that was enough to kick me out of the. I didn't, didn't look so fun anymore after I came home with a black eye and I thought that's just one day at practice. You know, these people who do it for a living that's everyday, but you only try. You try it for one day.

Speaker 1:          00:21:28       Oh, well, you know, I was like, this is crazy to say now. I've always been a huge fan of boxing because I grew up in an era where it was one of the great errors in boxing history and so you know, you think long enough that you want to, you want to see what it's like, and I had a buddy that I worked with, he was the one who showed up with the black guy after the weekend was over and he said, I'll take him, we'll fool around. The first thing I learned that I didn't know is how much some of these guys just love it because you think who would like getting hit? And I met one of these guys and he was like, you don't understand the sport, you just don't understand it, but season he's put some gloves on. We'll go in there.

Speaker 1:          00:21:58       Well that's when you learn, you know, especially I have a soft face. That's, that guy's an asshole. That's not how you're supposed to teach somebody about boxing. You're not supposed to even think about sparring for a long time. Paul, I think he was going to show me a lesson and these gonna Cheat on you. That's right. Yeah. I had a buddy of mine do the same thing, assholes. They know how to quite already and they put gloves on. You beat the shit out of you. He was waiting with one punch, Joe, let's not make it more one that I learned my lesson pretty fast. I'm a smart guy. Joe took one punch and you're like, okay, got through my defense with the first one and that was it. Well, you need to learn stuff. This is like boxing the way. It really should be taught to someone.

Speaker 1:          00:22:33       If you really want someone to learn, you should teach them the proper fundamentals on how to move their body and then you slowly teach them how to slowly hit things. How about protective head gear for the new guy? What about that? That protective headgear does less than you think. I know I've read that actually there also, they're also removing it from Olympic competition. Now you ever see that? You know, I had mentioned to my wife, didn't they used to have boxing in the Olympics? Do they even just show it anymore? Did they show it because I didn't see it? You don't see it as much. I was so big when I was a kid. I wonder what they decide to put on and how they decide. It's got to be based on ratings. Right? Because like archery, you see archery for like 30 seconds. Look, the Arrow flew through the air next.

Speaker 1:          00:23:11       You know, and then gymnastics is always a big one. People have watched people flip. I told my wife there was this competition called a biathlon will you ski and shoot? And she said, you're making that up. I said, no, it's really an Olympic sport. It is a weird sport. Right. What a strange combination with those scandinavians just kick everybody's rear end. Yeah, because they're all out there skiing and shooting. Exactly right. It's rude. It's a lot of moose in that area. That's a strange. The Olympics are strange in what is a metal and what is not like. Ballroom dancing is an Olympic synchronized swimming. That's an Olympics. I'm not denigrating anybody. If you're a professional synchronized swimmer, I am. I'll take the blame. That's. Please do a lot like curling. Ever seen that one? Yeah. That's another one. I always thought that was what they did on like cruises for old people, but apparently it's a little bit shuffleboard.

Speaker 1:          00:23:59       It's very close. There's no brooms involved in. Shuffled. Does no brooms and know what's curling. You're trying to drink the other guy out of the way. Right. Trying to knock your. It's very complicated. I never quite mastered the. I was in Newfoundland. I know how to say it now because people got mad at me because I said, oh, we're calling new found blend that gets its newfoundland. They're probably correct. Correct me again. I'm probably fucking it up again. I'm not even going to try, but I was making fun of curling and they went crazy. They were so upset at me. I was like, come on folks. Those are not people to get get mad at you either. They're hardy. Say it's very cold. Yeah. Different kinds of different kind of life, but what I don't know what. What do they do to decide like what goes on the air?

Speaker 1:          00:24:39       It must just be based on popularity. Right? The Olympics. I got to tell you, if I'm the. If I'm the network executive deciding what goes on the air, that's what I'm going to base it on. Did you see all those videos of people getting robbed that were just walking down the street and Rio? Rio? No, but I go to a website sometimes when I'm bored and have nothing better to do that is just, you know, stuff that people upload, you know, just to blow your mind and say wow, that and half of them are from Brazil for some reason, you know, and they're always terrible. You just go. I know it's giving me a, um, an unusually wrong version of what Brazil is light, but when they said the Olympics, we're going to be there. I said, do you know half the videos on this site or from Rio?

Speaker 1:          00:25:15       So. Well, it's, it does have a history of violence, that's for sure. It's a strange place and that's kind of the reverse of la in that La you, you essentially have the expensive homes in the hills and then the people that have the less expensive homes are on the bottom. But in Rio it's the opposite. The people on the bottom, like near the ocean, it's the really expensive homes and up in the hills with this amazing views are all the favelas. So it's all these houses that don't have any windows. Some of them have dirt floors and there's like extreme extreme poverty. I know some of these communities they can't eat. The police can't even go into right somehow. Really hardcore. Very. Did you ever see city of God the movie? No, but I saw the preview. Does that count? Does not count, but it's, it makes Boyz in the hood look like Mary poppins and it's based on life in the favela is like really, really based on it.

Speaker 1:          00:26:08       Like these kinds of actual scenarios actually do take place where young kids with guns form gangs and you know, you're, you're looking at like 10 year old kids. Doesn't. That almost seemed to be like a law of nature though because you do see it everywhere in these. When you go to the poor countries or poor parts of the US, like you said, uh, you were talking about how the poor communities are, are pretty much like the nicer communities in some ways. I used to have to go down to compton all the time when I worked in news down here and Compton in the daytime. It looks just fine. People are trying to keep their lawns mowed. They're out there working on their homes. I mean everything. It's when darkness falls that things can get a little weird on certain street corners and, and whatnot. But you know, I remember going down, they just think, boy, everybody here is really trying, you know, I mean, they're really keeping up their homes and trying to make everything nice.

Speaker 1:          00:26:53       And, and at nighttime they're just victims. A lot of the time, you know, they shut their doors and close their windows and try to stay out of what's going on outside. It is weird that it's night, like there's something happens to people when there's not as much people that sleep all day. I used to be one of those people once upon a time, but compton, like if you looked at a good neighborhood, like how many people are getting by and how many people are fucking it up, you know, in a great neighborhood. Maybe it's like 100 people are getting by and one guy's fucking it up. You like one issue out of 100. But in compton it might be three and that's enough. That's enough to give the whole neighborhood a black guy. You're right. It doesn't take very many. That's right. Yeah. A friend of mine has a gym in Compton and I was telling we were headed there and I was like, yeah, it's in Compton.

Speaker 1:          00:27:40       My, the guy I was going with like, Jesus, we're going to compton. I was like, it's a fucking wrong. It's just a city. It's just go there. What does this compton cowboys. I just googled compton in his story. Just came up from yesterday. What's the fuck is this the guys that ride horses through Compton? I guess it's even legal. I didn't know you could do that in la because, uh, like in New York they have to have a device that hooks up to the horse so it doesn't, you know, have manure on the streets. How did they get around that? There is lyrice cowboys roping and riding right in the heart of Compton have found their hobby contains some of the most dangerous neighborhoods. I have a regular nine to five job, but I'm a cowboy. Hossley said good for him. I'm in favor of that.

Speaker 1:          00:28:21       But you're not a cowboy. Keep the horse. First of all, there's no cows. You're a horse boy. What do you. You're in a horses. Is that a backyard horse? I mean, we beat that. It must be. Well, there's some. I mean I know that like I've seen them in Burbank, Burbank. There's sections of a, which is where NBC is. Jay Leno tonight show the sections of that that are at question. So you're allowed to have a stable in your yard and people will just ride horses down the street. You see it all the time. They used to have a place called pickwick stables right outside of Burbank that was like that. Yeah. They used to have the equestrian center down there when I was a kid 50 years ago or whenever it was. Yeah. Horse Horse riding makes you a cowboy. You'd not accounting less cows are involved.

Speaker 1:          00:29:03       Is that the Rogan standard on that? Just think that's a fact. I just think that's the fact that your horsepower, will you call them cowboys? Because they would chase cow. They would herd them, you know. Okay, I'll go with you. I just don't have the expertise to compete on that subject. They have the competition policy. What does is they have an actual ranch called richland farms. I was just looking at it up, try to find out like more pictures or what it really looks like, you know, I'll tell you. Educated. I was. I didn't know they had enough open property out there to look at that. Yeah. Wow. So they have chickens and shit. I'm impressed and these guys are doing little things with their horses where they're running them through routine for them. Interesting. Very interesting. Yeah. Well, you know what man, when people find open spaces and spaces that are vacant and they start reclaiming them and occasionally good things come out of that and you know what, there's a lot of cities in the United States and in Europe and stuff that that had built giant open spaces, you know, whether it's a central park in New York or anything like that.

Speaker 1:          00:30:01       It changes the whole feel of these urban centers don't have to have big open pieces of territory in the midst of the urban sprawl. I mean, if that's what they'd done, got more power to them. La needs more of that. I think you're right. And it keeps it from growing. Like one of the really smart things that Boulder's Don's, they buy up all the open space when lots are available all around boulder. They just buy it up, the city buys it up and they just prevent people from building on it. That's why it costs like $9,000 a month to have an apartment in boulder. Yeah, it's super expensive, but you know, I mean ultimately it's probably a good idea, right? Oh yeah. Well, from it from your own living purposes. Absolutely. So I mean that's what I want. I look in Oregon. I can park anywhere.

Speaker 1:          00:30:40       I tell Angelenos that near that. Really the only people, New Yorkers and Angelenos understand when you say I can park anywhere dude. And they just go, Oh really? Yeah. My Buddy Steve moved from New York. He was living in Brooklyn and he moved to Seattle and he was like, I should have been here a long time ago. Oh totally. He's like fucking traffics. Nothing. He's like, people are complaining but they don't know like it takes 10 minutes more to get where you're going. That's it right now. And you know, nowadays, I mean in the old days if you and I wanted to work, you had to live where the work was now. I mean even the actors don't live here much anymore, you know? Yeah. Well Open space I think is a really smart thing because people left their own devices will really fuck up anything. They'll just build on top of shit and stack things up and stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:31:24       People in there. And next thing you know, the views gone. Everything's gone, chicken ranch next to your house. It's one of the things that this country has. It's really interesting is public land, these gigantic national parks like yellowstone, all these different places that you can go to. Mostly in the West though, you know, that was a win, that sage brush rebellion type thing happened up in Oregon. You know what? The one area where they're still having trials about and everything that the were they see 20 years ago I would have remembered their names right off the bat, but there's a wilderness thing up in Oregon. We had that whole thing. Well, their complaint was that the federal government doesn't have big tracks of land in the eastern part of the country where things started. They reverted that land back to the public, but they had these huge swaths of land in the West because it was kind of a different government by the time they were out here in the west.

Speaker 1:          00:32:12       I truthfully, I'm kinda thankful they do because if they didn't, it wouldn't be here anymore. I mean, that's the way I look at it and just be gone. Yeah. Most likely that that whole land thing was really confusing for people. They were trying to figure out what the hell is going on because if you. Unless you really dive into the story and try to find out who's angry at who and why is the government moving in on these people and what's what's happening. Because there was a few of these sort of rancher type disputes with the government. Remember there was one in Nevada as well.

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       I actually can speak to this a little bit because what I was a talk radio host up there. Those people were actually a large part of any talk radio show audience and they were a little different back in the day of say the Clinton administration in the mid 19 nineties, but. But the modern movement kind of grew out of that and if you understand the position of those people in those small towns, those people essentially made a living in resource extraction so they didn't have the big factories that they had back east and Detroit and everything. They logged or they mind or they did those kinds of things and so when the government will decide, for example, we have a problem with the spotted owl, so we're going to cut back on the logging. The people in places like Portland where everybody's got a software job or something, they they're like, absolutely, that's a wonderful thing, but those devastated some of those communities and you know, it's everything from the schools in those areas not getting a lot of tax dollars anymore or the problem they have an Oregon.

Speaker 2:          00:33:33       There's a lot of those small communities. All the young people are gone because there's no jobs. So the old people who have homes stay, there's no jobs because everybody was in logging and they get very resentful. So when they wanted the public land turned over to private people because they were hoping the private people would start off the meals again and people could work. So in that sense, I felt like the media really didn't really didn't look at that side of the story, which is. I'm not saying these people are right or wrong, but understand that this wasn't a question of the government's got to get off of our net. It was jobs and I think we can all understand jobs.

Speaker 3:          00:34:07       Well, what was going on in Oregon was cattle, ranchers and public land and they decrease. Hey, today's. Yeah. They didn't want to pay for public land. Now, before I had ever ventured into public land, I didn't understand the whole cattle grazing thing, but when I was in the first time I was in Montana, we went, uh, we took a float down the Missouri River. We went down to where the Missouri Breaks and Montana's beautiful. Oh man, it's amazing. But one of the things I was like, there's these cows everywhere. Like, is it, this is public land, right? And um, my friend Steve had a sort of explained to me how they kind of leased the land. They let cows graze this land and they do it at this riddick.

Speaker 2:          00:34:48       Yes. They made a lot of these laws in the late 18 hundreds of safety with the mining ones in the claims to that. So they have updated a lot of those things, um,

Speaker 3:          00:34:56       but then Nevada guys, or excuse me, the Oregon guys, they didn't want to pay. That was part of what was going on. They didn't want to pay their bill to least as far as experience

Speaker 2:          00:35:06       and there's different parties involved. So you had these ranchers, he didn't want to do that and then you have a bunch of people in the community who were sympathetic, not so much to that part, but the fact that the ranchers were mad at the same people that they were mad at. So, so, so that's why you hear a lot of people speak in these things saying I'm not really, you know, on their side, but we all generally have sympathy to the idea that we would like the federal government to stop telling us how many logs we can cut or those kinds of things. And that's a traditional American thing. Get the government off my back and whatever

Speaker 4:          00:35:36       it is. And there's points on both sides though, unfortunately. Oh absolutely. Because when you look at, like when you look at some that's been clear cut and you see like how much it's devastating. It's devastating when you see a giant swath of land that used to be filled with old growth trees and they replanted with a single mono crop instead and use, you know, they always call it like they want you to think it's like growing tomatoes, you know, they always say this is a renewable crop and yes and no. And, and like you said, the clear cuts are awful because you do think to yourself, couldn't you take like every fifth tree or a lot of times private land owners will do a better job of it. Not always. Sometimes they'll just think my kid needs to go to college. It's time to just level everything on this hill.

Speaker 4:          00:36:21       Sometimes though they're attitude is okay, this is my view. I mean I look out, I don't want to see a clear cut as well. I'll take every third or fourth tree and, and it becomes like a, an extra bank account for some of them. So. Well, it's if your whole business is the logging business, I can imagine like we were up in the redwood forest recently and as we were driving up there, you pass these lumber yards. There was this one lumber yard where it's just massive logs and massive amounts. They're just stacked up and you're looking at like in terms of the number of years of growth you're looking at when you're looking at this huge lumber yard filled with trees, like how many years of growth is that? How do you sustain it? Right? I mean if this is how much you need today, how do you make sure you have that much, 15, 20 years?

Speaker 4:          00:37:05       You know, what they're doing right now is, is the Canadians are logging a lot and in Russia, in the places like below the, the, the, they have a forest line in Siberia and they're logging a lot there too. I mean it's Kinda like gold that grows for those people. And so in one sense you find it hard to tell them not to because I'm doing just fine, but you can't log and make money. And the other hand, you know, we all do kind of share this and so it's hard to figure out how to manage things she does for the greater good as they say. That's the good point is that it's really, I mean, it's no ones you could call it property, but what it is, is like we're all sharing the resources of the earth and what's going on in the Amazon right now.

Speaker 4:          00:37:44       And uh, what happens when people move in and farm for cattle is one of the best arguments against factory farming and against supporting the meat industry pollutes rivers and all that devastating deforestation to at a ridiculously high rate. That's a big part of what's going, what's fueling the deforestation is they chopped down all these trees so that they can make gland for these cattle to graze on. And you can see by the way, how much money is involved because some of the, in some of those countries, the people that campaign, a lot of times they're indigenous people, it gets violent and people die. And you know what I mean? That's how much money we're talking about. Yeah, they killed. They were killed some nun that was protesting against the logging she got murdered recently. It's not that uncommon. And, and, and you know, everybody kind of knows this is, you know, you're taking. I mean, it's pretty brave when you think about what those people do because they get the threatening letters long before happens to them

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       and then to keep doing it. I admire people like that and whether or not I agree with a specific cause. Yeah. I mean who knows if they're even getting letters, you know, they just might get bullets. You know what I mean? If you start making a massive, making a lot of noise and making it problematic for the people that are earning a shitload of money, chopping those trees down, things can get real ugly. They get real nasty. I was in Mount Rainier and that was the first time I ever saw like real clear cut areas and that's an interesting place because it rains so much, you would think like it's a real fertile environment, like whatever trees that they do have. But when I was talking to one of the guys was up there, one of the cops that was um, uh, you know, it was a forest ranger type character.

Speaker 1:          00:39:14       Uh, he was saying that they do it, but it takes like 20 years for these things become trees again. Well, and they use different growth trees for different things. So you can grow the quick, you know, I always hear from the guys who want to grow hemp and say, well, if they would just grow hemp, it would make it. But it would make up for some uses. The old growth trees, they'll like, if you go into some of these, there are some Oregon hotels for example, they're all built with old growth and you go in there and you see what old growth can do and you say, okay, there are no other logs that you could do this with. You know, it's just a, it's a, you see the band saws that they use to cut that stuff. It's, it's a whole different level of tree.

Speaker 1:          00:39:51       But the replacement time periods, like a hundred and 50 years or something for those kinds of things. Yeah, it's kind of fucking crazy. We didn't really think about it. It's totally unsustainable, but you're right, it looks nothing like it. There's a company called urban hardwoods and they're in Seattle. I've heard of them and they make like tables and desks and stuff out of the most incredible looking. Would they take like real wood, like a real giant tree and they'll turn that giant tree. They'll cut chunks out of it and turn it into a table, but it's got like the outside edge. It's like the natural edge of the tree. I used to know a guy who was a big investor. He's dead now, but he would find investments to go to go by and he went and somehow he was so proud of this. He'd got himself a piece of a Koa Wood forest in Hawaii and he showed me the deed and the deed from the guy he bought it from had been signed by light King Kamehameha or something.

Speaker 1:          00:40:45       So he was bragging to me for years about this and then found out later Hawaii wouldn't let him cut any of it. So He. He bought it all on the premise that I had this valuable would and but for environmental and heritage reasons why you wouldn't let him, he was totally screwed. Wow. Well, at least you got a cool forest, a gorgeous heart and valuable and rare. Yeah. I don't think many like guitars out of the. I know they make pool cues. They used to make ships out of it. You know, like those old wooden ships. Beautiful. Yeah. The different densities of trees and the different grains and patterns. And when you look at actual like hardwood, it's such a fascinating and Admin, not invention, but creation of nature like these, the, the variety of the grain and the way they look. It's really like a work of art and it's, it's strange how it affects us visually.

Speaker 1:          00:41:33       Like if you look at a piece of redwood that's been polished and sanded and cut, it's like you see the grain in. It's like, wow, that is so pretty. You know, it's, it's interesting how that affects us. I'm wondering who's winning the pool for what they thought we would talk about today. How many people had hardwoods? Nobody there, right about hemp though. As far as the construction material, they make that stuff called hempcrete. Have you ever seen that? It's like no product that they make with hemp. It's incredibly. Has incredible installation values. It's really difficult to light on fire. It's going to be used a lot up until about the thirties and forties. It was a pretty big crop for a lot of industrial use is everybody. Everybody who looks into it for five minutes knows that. Yeah. Well that's one of those things were stoners love to sit down and talk to you about it.

Speaker 1:          00:42:19       You know man Henry Ford made the first. George Washington. Yeah. Do George Washington grew pot bro? Ben Franklin smoked pot. Yeah. Yeah, they probably did good stuff. Hard to prove. Yeah. Well they definitely liked him. You know, there definitely were into hemp and they were definitely into using it as a commodity and a textile, you know, and you can go back and forth about that. Like the pay, the dress like that. The first tech waste and one of the first drafts of the declaration of independence was written on hemp and parachutes sales sales with a lot of stuff we used in both world wars for equipment in fabric, a lot of stuff like that. Even the term canvas comes from the word cannabis because that's what it was. Made a member that actually. Yeah. Yeah. It's interesting how it's becoming illegal, but that's another thing that's really fascinating about this time.

Speaker 1:          00:43:06       It's like slowly in your state, Washington state, Colorado, you're studying to see so much money coming in from it being legal that it's going to trickle down into other states. It's almost kind of a great experiment, isn't it? And I've. I've said before and I, I might've even said on this show, the very first time we got together, I think we may have talked about, you know, what's going to happen, we, because we have this divergence between the states and the federal government and as you probably know, only a couple of weeks ago the federal government decided to leave marijuana classified as a schedule one drug for the same reason they always did. Which is they say that the research doesn't show anything and then you find out what they're not really permitted do the research. So it's this catch 22. So at some point either the feds are going to have to move toward the states or somebody going to get into power that says, enough of this dichotomy, we're going to crack down.

Speaker 1:          00:43:52       I have no idea what that would look like. It would look ugly. You can't crack down. Now the amount of money that Colorado is making is changed. The, the quality of life for so many people there, their real estate values have gone up. The drunk driving accidents have gone way down, drunk driving arrest, way down, violent crime, way down. I mean, it's really fascinating what's happened to Colorado. Look at what the feds have already done in, in, in roundabout ways. For example, one of the things that they've said and some of these places is if you have a medical marijuana card, you can't get pain medication prescribed to you. If you have a medical marijuana card, a judge just upheld, didn't they? That you. That you can be denied a gun. Yeah, they don't deny people guns for drinking the pills. Yeah, so the only reason that that works is because you have a disagreement between state and federal law and they're siding with the higher law, which is the way the law is supposed to work, but at what point, at what point do we have such a of a division between the reality on the ground in these states and what federal law says that the rubber's gonna meet the road somewhere.

Speaker 1:          00:44:54       I don't know who wins, but there's going to be a moment where you have a rubber meets the road moment. Yeah, and it's an interesting case with the National Rifle Association too, because the NRA, which is always a course pro gun and really trying to stop any laws that infringe upon the rights of people to uphold the second amendment, but when you get to this pot thing, they don't want to fuck with the pot thing. I think they did. I may be wrong about this, but I do believe that they did come out and say that you shouldn't be denying people's rights the better. I think that. Well, there's a lot. It's in their interest, it's in their interest to. There's a lot of closet pot smokers out there because it's obviously the stereotype is always been that it makes you lazy and it makes you dumb and sort of gives you brain damage and you forget things that's been shown time and time again to not be true.

Speaker 1:          00:45:41       I mean when you are high as fuck, you do forget things like when you're in the throws of like that. I remember reading a study once where they were studying population in Jamaica where a lot of these people who were 75 years old had been doing it their whole lives and they didn't show any. Anything that would make you your eyes bulge out, your hair stand up and made nothing seemed that out of the ordinary in terms of whether you're talking about cancer rates, are any of these other things. If there were something like that, God, it would be beaten into our head. Right, and that's all the contents of pharmaceutical drugs and all the people that are making money off of marijuana remaining in this schedule. One category which are pretty significant. There's a lot of people that make money off of it. The category is ridiculous.

Speaker 1:          00:46:24       I mean, that's just crazy. Do you see what's going on in Arizona? I tweeted about it. I think yesterday, these people who were protesting against marijuana being legalized in Arizona, that people are spending the most money. We're talking hundreds of thousands of dollars to try to keep marijuana illegal and Arizona are directly tied to pharmaceutical drugs. That's directly tied to pain pills, specifically the stuff that killed prince. What's that stuff called? Fentanyl? Fentanyl. Fentanyl. Well, Arizona was a weird state of the two. They have some very conservative people. This is the alcohol industry. Before that there was one. So that's the alcohol industry. And then there's also the, um, the fentanyl industry. It might be a little bit earlier to see if you scroll down a little bit further, see if you find it. But it's just bizarre that we allow that stuff and it's so transparent today as opposed to this stuff all went on behind the scenes 100 years ago, which of course is why marijuana got made illegal area. Fentanyl maker donates big to campaign opposing pot legalization. That's fast. Yeah. There you go. A $500,000 towards

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       defeating a ballot initiative that would make recreational use of marijuana illegal under Arizona law. You're just criminals here. A bunch of crooks. The fact that you guys would spend that much money to stop a drug that has nothing to do with what you do, but I'll make the case, and this is pretty much what my political show has been about since the very beginning, is that that's a fact of factor of the corruption in our system. Um, when, when it's a pay to play system. Well, I mean that's how this happens. If you're going to impact somebody else's business by legalizing something else than the way you fight, that is you go out there and you donate to the, to the cause. I mean, in other words, instead of the people getting what they want, it's, it's, it's whomever donates the most. And I remember Justice Scalia before he died was part of a ruling where he basically said, that's not a, a, a bug.

Speaker 2:          00:48:16       It's a feature. This is the way the system is supposed to work, you know, money is, is supposed to represent the views of people and if it's poor people, they can bundle it all together and then if, if there's no money, obviously there's not a lot of people who care and that was the theory, but what it's really done is, is mean if you don't have money flowing into Washington, you don't count. You're not at the table. Right? So there's whole sectors of the American society that are essentially unrepresented because there's no money coming from them. That's the real problem. And wasn't this sort of structure, the government structure that sort of enforces that or, or relies upon that. It was kind of established before corporations were and definitely established before corporations were allowed to act as an individual and donate insane amounts of money to campaigns the problem.

Speaker 2:          00:49:03       And you look at it and you just. You can see how it happened because you could see that that the people that gave a little money back in the days when you could only give this much money, had a little influence. So what do you want to do? You want to influence them to let you give a little bit more and slowly but surely you evolve into a system. I mean that was talking to my wife about this the other day where we were talking about how it was never a good system, but it was a fairer system back when I was a kid in the 19 seventies because some of the money came from entities that represented people who were blue collar people. So for example, when unions were big a private employee unions, not the public employee unions. They're so popular now. So if you were a pipe fitter or a plumber or those people that had the electricians had pretty powerful unions, those people would bundle money and those unions would give money to candidates that sort of compensated for the fact that you had corporate money or whatever and other directions.

Speaker 2:          00:49:55       In the 19 eighties when the Democrats started getting waxed regularly and were due to Reagan changing tax policies and whatever else, we started to get some really wealthy people and the union started getting less powerful. All of a sudden, you know, Willie Sutton, the bank robber was famously asked, you know, why do you rob banks? And he says, that's where the money is. Well, in the eighties, you know, after 84, especially after Mondale got waxed by Reagan, they, that's when superdelegates started to. They went and they looked and they said, okay, what do we need to compete? Because if you look at the longterm trends, the people that Republicans tend to get money from, they're just getting more money. The people that we tend to get money from or getting weaker, and that's when, that's the role Bill Clinton played in the Democratic Leadership Council where they basically said we can go and get money from those same sources.

Speaker 2:          00:50:39       So they did. Okay, so fast forward to now everybody's taken money from those same sources and the people that are lower and middle class have no way to break into that game. Right? So if you know Lawrence Lessig, the Harvard law professor did a great book called Republic last, where he pointed out how he went and interviewed politicians who didn't even realize there was another side. Sometimes to the issue they were voting on because they hadn't heard from any money. Right, so you almost. You almost felt like a lot of these people were almost blameless because in their minds, well, nobody cares about this or I would've had some money coming in for that. It's strange how the systems evolve, but the one thing you can say for sure is you're not getting money from people who don't have money, and so eventually we get to this dichotomy where there's a lot of people in this country right now. What's that old line about taxation without representation. A lot of people in this country not represented a 100 percent.

Speaker 3:          00:51:30       Also, you have to think about how many people feel disenfranchised by the system and it doesn't seem like it's gonna be fixed anytime soon because the amount of people that are contributing to these campaigns, when you look at the percentage of human beings on this landmass is very small and so the amount of people that have influence, it's a very small amount of people that are affecting the lives of a vast majority of people and it becomes a very weird sort of a scenario when we continue with the same representative government structure that we had back when it was impossible to communicate with people and the other side of the country. Like you had a Senate, you know Morse code or a guy on a horse with a letter. It was hard, so this is why they decided to have representative government in the first place.

Speaker 3:          00:52:11       You couldn't communicate with people. Now that you can. It's like we, we, we really ultimately have to decide. I think one day it is one person, one vote, like do we all as a mass has 300 million people get to decide. Like if a hundred 90 million people think one thing and the rest, think another thing. How does this all work out? Like how do, how do we decide? Because right now we have delicates, we have representatives, we have senators, we have all these different people that sort of a buffer us from the actual decisions that are being made and I think as we, as it becomes easier and easier to communicate and express your opinions and give your thoughts on things, the option of voting online and the option of voting directly for issues without representation seems more and more enticing to people.

Speaker 2:          00:52:58       Yeah. But you'd have to change the constitution and, and you know, that'd be a good idea. So old as fuck. I hate to. It depends on. I'm reading a book right now that talks about our government actually operating sort of between the lines of the, of the constitution. So there's room to maneuver and over time for understandable reasons like security and other things. I mean the fact that nuclear bombs were invented, changed everything that within those lines there's room to sort of expand what you can do, but you do that generation after generation and then you look around and go, how did we get from where we were in 1942 where we are now? It's almost inexplicably and and sometimes when I talk about reform, you try to figure out how you can dial things back, but we've come so far beyond any point you could dial it back to. It becomes really hard to imagine. It's like you have an old mainframe computer that you've patched and patched and patched, and the only way now to make any real reform is to throw the computer out and buy a new Mac and start from scratch and nobody can do that. I mean, you can't even figure out how to get that done.

Speaker 3:          00:53:58       Yeah. It's almost like we need an asteroid to take out the grid, just come down and boom and wreck the whole. Just a big earthquake or a title wave have to be a big thing. A big, big thing that unfortunately kills a lot of people. Then the government will step in and say, well, you know, we have to take care of all of you down and your security martial law. People on the street corner was a government's dead or the hits them. How symbol, symbol amatic. It would be symbolic. It would be rather simple maddox and ignored with how amazing it would be. Like if that's the only place where an asteroid hit, if it hit the Pentagon and the White House, if like this is too broken up. Chunks of space. Rock one slams into the Pentagon. Kills everyone. Hey Blaine. Yeah, the god of terror.

Speaker 3:          00:54:45       The God of terror. Yeah, I mean that is. That's really almost the only way. Something has to be catastrophic in order for them to try to reset and rebuild a completely new system and then people would have to agree. You. They'd have to get to together and go, okay, are we going to go back to that thing that was written on him by people that wrote with feathers or are we going to Redo this? We're gonna figure this out from a modern perspective, knowing what we know now about our ability to communicate and knowing what we know now about all the things that are the founding fathers of this country did an amazing job of trying to protect from corruption, you know, trying to make sure that their, their vision of what America could be, that this experiment in self government and they put all these safeguards in play, but there's no way they could have ever predicted how far technology would have taken us in the 200 plus years since they did that. There's just no way they, they, they, they, they couldn't have any idea. So now that we know where we are now and we can sort of extrapolate where it's going to be in the next 50 a hundred years and maybe plan for the future, the digital future that we're dealing with now. And then we thought it was the case. We would have put in some, some things that people would agree with in regards to like what the NSA got caught with, you know, with the mass surveillance of the.

Speaker 2:          00:56:03       Let's talk about that for because I was just going to go there. You know, I was thinking not that long ago, if you could, if they force you, because we all understand that that history is an evolution, so, so all of this is the result of decades and decades and generations of generations of building stuff on top of other things, but if you had to pick the time that was most transformative for all those you were talking about, you have to go back to the United States between 1947 and 1948. That's when Harry Truman and the government passed these rules that made everything we talk about today, the NSA, the CIA, all those things are developments from like national security. I mean NSC. 60 eight is one of those big ones. A bunch of these rules that created the modern United States, we'll call it the secret government that we know about today.

Speaker 2:          00:56:53       And you know, if you go back in time, you can certainly understand what they were thinking. I mean, you have to remember how crazy it was after the second world war and this feeling that the Soviet Union was this threat to the whole world and now you have nuclear weapons and can you really declare war if there's nuclear weapons. That could be, you know, there's a whole bunch of things where you go here, kind of get what was going on, but it didn't take Harry Truman Long, you know, after he left office to say I made a few mistakes including things like the CIA and whatnot. But once you start those programs, there's an autopilot that that happens and they develop a momentum of their own. So if you said today, because I would make this case, if you wanted to look at this the way my stepfather, when he was a total profit and loss guy, and you would look at something like the CIA, you would say the CIA is a terrible failure.

Speaker 2:          00:57:39       They miss all the big things. Whether it's the fall of the Soviet Union, you name it, right? The CIA has got major failures and then you said, you know, all the things that they've done that were nefarious that they shouldn't have. So if this were a private business, you'd turn around and go, well, listen, that's a last thing right there. You know, let's take that division scrap it startled you can't do that in a government for some reason. It's almost impossible to decide this whole area has been a failure. So let's start over and that's the problem because I'm not sure you can reform things that are, that are flawed at the seeds. Do you know what I mean? Um, and, and the CIA is a perfect example, but even the NSA, I mean, did you see that this week they're, once again trying to slip a bill and that would allow the government without a warrant to track, you know, every website you go to an all these things, how does this stuff get that far?

Speaker 2:          00:58:25       They're going, they're going to attach it to a totally unrelated bill so that you don't know about it. Again, how do they get away with this? Most likely it's just justifying something they're already doing well and they're legitimately afraid. There's stuff to be afraid of, so I don't always, you know, you have to cut them a little slack, but there's no waiting at all about the downside. I mean, it's almost like the only thing we pay attention to is the terror side of the ledger. Not the fact that, do you John Mccain or Lindsey Graham, do you really want the government knowing every webs, especially Lindsey Graham. There's got to be some websites there that he really would not like the government to know about. Come on. At least think about yourself. You know, so I don't know how you stop this dynamic. We're such a fearful people that that's what's going to kill us. Well, we know what we've done. Other people we know. Payback is probably likely. That's. And you know what's. What's really sad is I've always had this rose colored view of us and I acknowledged that it's a myth, but always look at the myth

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       of America as I call it, the 19 fifties high school textbook view of American. That to me is what I want to move towards. So when they talk about creating a more perfect union, that to me is the goal and anything that conflicts with that self image to me is the problem. So when you see sometimes how we really operate anything Dick Cheney does, um, and I don't use the word evil, so I'll use the word nefarious Dick Cheney is to me when you say what do you want to avoid in this country? I want to avoid. We're Dick Cheney wants us to go because nothing conflicts with my 19 fifties, mythological American textbook idea than what Cheney wants us to be. And when you look at some of the things we've done, some of the things based on that 19, 47, 19, 48 America, which we thought, okay, we have to do everything to stop global communism.

Speaker 4:          01:00:05       They're gonna take over the country. Once you look at some of the things we did and you realize some of what we're dealing with today is blowback. You don't know how to undo that. I mean, you almost think it's like permanent damage. Look at the way some in the Middle East. See us. I mean, uh, I'll, I'll talk to people like I remember talking to Sam Harris about this and he was talking about what you have to see things a certain way and I said yes, but that's not going to help you solve the problem. How do you solve the problem if we've already, if we've already soiled our bed so much that you don't know how to fix that. You don't have to go and say, listen, we're sorry about this. Can we start from scratch? You can't do that in foreign affairs. Just like you can't do it with the mainframe computer.

Speaker 4:          01:00:38       That is the government, you know, I can't figure out how to, how to reverse course to a point where we can once again fix stuff, right? It's, it's too damaged. I think it just has to dry out slowly but surely look all the wounds of the past to heal up and dry out and it just takes time. How do you do it when they're still after? You mean we've already made enough people mad at us so that thereafter us. Well now we have to go protect ourselves by going and getting them, so we perpetuate the cycle. Like I can't figure out how to jump off the merry go round. You know what I mean? I don't think it moves that way. I think we're trying to make a battleship move like a race car and I just think it takes a long time to shift course and when we're looking at these people that are in the Middle East that are opposing the US right now and angry and want to attack the US right now, you're most likely never going to get to them.

Speaker 4:          01:01:23       You might get to their grandchildren and I think that might be the only way. Things slowly but surely settled down and that's the argument for the NSA and the CIA to continue to monitor things that are really kind of ridiculous and invasive level because there's so many people out there that hate us or hate the government. I hate the military and hate what's happened to them and so many martyrs are created. Every time a drone strike was going to go. How do you. How do you, how do you get that next generation to not hate us when we're busy killing their parents because their parents want to kill us. I mean, that's the cycle and I can't figure out how to break the cycle. How do you protect ourselves from their anti American parents in a way that doesn't turn them against us to. Does that make sense?

Speaker 4:          01:02:03       It's a real. It definitely makes sense in the. It's hard. No one has a real logical answer to that. I mean, he talked to the Ron Paul supporters and they think we should just separate and don't police the world and take care of our own and just stay there and still people will want to kill us. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then you talk to the people that are on the Dick Cheney camp that like you're out of your mind. You're living in a dream movie world in the real world is dirty and nasty and we need all these people. We need all these operatives. We need people constantly monitoring these hotspots all around the world because like, look what's going on in North Korea. They're fucking testing nuclear bombs now and you know, what are we doing? We're flying by. We're. We're making these threatening gestures. We were flying fighter jets around North Korea.

Speaker 4:          01:02:53       It's, it's, it's really spooky. It's spooky because something can happen and we don't have anybody over there, you know, at least as far as I know. I mean, I don't know. Maybe we have some deep, deep, deep undercover CIA people working as North Korean soldiers. But I'll tell you what upsets me though, because what we were just talking about, getting off the merry go round. It means kind of not perpetuating the same mistakes we've made before. But what drives me crazy about our system is that the people who make mistakes, and I've always said, you know, you've forgiven people, make mistakes. You're gonna make a mistake, right? You shouldn't be allowed to make another one though, right? At the highest levels of government when you send people to war and we shouldn't have gone to war. I'll cut you some slack, but I don't want you then going on cnn and being the expert who tells us how to handle the next crisis, right?

Speaker 4:          01:03:38       Because your track record sucks. Dick Cheney's got a terrible track record. We still listen to him. He still gets to be a person who, who moves the public debate and there's a lot of people like that. You look at the John Bolton's. There's a heck of a lot of these guys who are consistently and regularly wrong, but we put them out there as though, oh, this is somebody you should listen to now. And the show. He's going to analyze how we should handle North Korea. Yeah, but he was wrong as heck about Iraq and all these other things, so we're going to listen to him on that next subject. We don't make people who are wrong in this country pay the price, which means you know, if you're in a private, if you're a doctor and you screw up a few surgeries and people who should not die, die.

Speaker 4:          01:04:15       You're done. You'll be out of business. They will take your license. You won't get to kill anymore. People in government. You can continue to make these errors and you, you'll be promoted. You'll be in a position to make more. Yeah, that'll kill you. Over the long haul, do you wonder like what, what motivation is Dick Cheney have? I mean, he doesn't even have a heart. They took his heart out. They stuck some cadaver heart in their worldview, but it's not a 19 fifties us high school textbook worldview. Right? But I mean, why is he doing it? Like what is his motivation for continuing to keep Pistons on who you ask? Sometimes it's money. Sometimes it's powerful friends. I've talked to these people and they'll give you the old. You don't know how the world works. Speech. Right? And, and at that point you have to say to yourself, okay, listen, I know the constitution is just a piece of paper, but at some point there's a rubber meets the road. That's going to be my word for today's. Joe Rogan showed me my fly in the ointment for today's Joe Rogan show. But there's got to be a point where somebody has to sit down and say, look, we have a constitution that does this. Here's the way the world really works. Now either we're going to go back to one or we're going to discard

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       one and completely embrace the other. At this point we embrace the hypocrisy that we still live like this, but the world's a difficult, tough place, so we're acting like that. Does that make sense? Yeah. No, no, it does. It definitely makes sense. And that dichotomy is what makes so many Americans angry. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's, it's amazing that we've limited the amount of attacks on American soil to nine slash 11 and Pearl Harbor. Well, you had the Orlando attack. It depends on what you classify the town. Lando attack was a crazy fuck that lived in America. I mean that was a gun wolf stuff. What's that guy proven to be gay or is that like what that is? I'm sure he's okay. How about that? But, but, but that's a perfect example though, of, of why this is so tough to defend yourself against. Because. And this is the same thing by the way, the country has been worried about American radicals for decades.

Speaker 2:          01:06:08       I mean, you go look at how we treated the 19 sixties leftist radicals that were putting bombs in the Pentagon and stuff like that. I mean, it always blows my mind to realize that if those guys were doing that today, we might waterboard them at Guantanamo, you know? Um, so I think the domestic radical idea has been something the government's been worried about since the first red scare in the 19, 19 era and the anarchists and that whole era. Yeah. And I think whenever you have a government, whenever you have people that are in charge, there's going to be people that oppose those people and they're going to try to go through some people that are opposing them. We're going to go through legal channels and they're going to protest legally and they're going to organize and give speeches and other people are gonna say, look, that doesn't work.

Speaker 2:          01:06:52       We're going to do this guerrilla style. We're going to do this. So now we come to the hacks, right? That's where we're at. See, I argued in the last common sense program that that the hacks are kind of a chickens coming home to roost thing that when we deputize our representatives to keep some secrets from us, because we all understand that there's going to be some of those, but if you did that in a private business, Joe, if you work for a boss, you're your. You're delivering pizzas at the Pizza Company and the boss says, do you listen to? Sometimes I have to have a little plausible deniability, so if you have to stamp something top secret on your, on your order form, I won't look at it and we'll all be cool. Okay, so one day you're out with prostitutes and drinking beer and you don't deliver your pizza and you think if I put top secret on this, the boss won't see it will be great.

Speaker 2:          01:07:34       I mean, it's human nature that after a you're going to start to classify stuff that really shouldn't be secret, right? I W I t and I said this in the last show, I talked to an intelligence operative once. It wouldn't tell me anything except I asked him a question once about if you had to guess what percentage of stuff is the stuff that Americans would agree should be kept secret. He said about 10 percent. I said, what's the rest? He said, everything you can think of. He said, cover your own rear end corporate deal that a senator doesn't want his constituents to know about for 40 years because he'll get voted, you know, all the and it's. It becomes a point where when you're keeping that much stuff from the American people that they have a right to know. It seems to be inevitable that there will be literally leaks like you're trying to cover too much.

Speaker 2:          01:08:15       Damn. With, with two little concrete. It's natural. I think in some of these guys like William beneath the one that everybody knows. He said, I went through every channel I was supposed to go to and I ended up with officers pointing federal agents, pointing machine guns at me as I came out of the shower. So when when the system breaks down to the point where the whistleblowers go through the proper channels and they become the ones who get into trouble than you're asking for leaks and it's hard to say, I feel sorry for you that they leaked that vital information, but if you haven't been keeping nonvital information from us for so long that might not have happened. And then you do get release of stuff that none of us thinks should be released. That's the terrible problem. It doesn't seem like leaks are not just inevitable now, but it's baked into the pie that baked into it.

Speaker 2:          01:09:03       It seems like there's almost no way to keep stuff secret now operative at the Democratic and Republican parties. How much would you want to bake it into the cake that you try to see that there'll be a leak against your opponents before the next election? How much does that now become a part of your strategize? Yeah, yeah, for sure. I'll put out a little stuff that I hacked on the DNC kind of attitude, you know, or whatever. I mean listen, and if and if the Russians are, you know, Vladimir Putin said that, what's the problem? Shouldn't we just look, the American people should know this stuff. So we released this information or somebody releases this information, but if they only release information on one side, have they influenced the election? Right. So you have to be careful how that works too. They have the ability to sort of set the tone of the discussion.

Speaker 2:          01:09:46       Yeah. I wonder what if they checked the Republicans, if they checked like what kinds of crazy shit was said when they realize that Donald Trump was running away with it, heard something that there'd been a hack and I, and it was like new news, so I'm not up to speed, but that there had been at the RNC to. Did you see everybody's freaking out now over the fact. And again we have to make the disclaimer that the Russian hackers or whomever I had this Russian hackers would get mad at me when I say that. Whomever it was that did this, that they've been known to alter stuff. So you have to take it all with a grain of salt, but, but what came out, I guess was a list, and this is from the Democratic Party's main list of donors, right? Their internal documents which shows the top donors how much they gave, and then what was given in return, Basadur ships, director of homeland security, all that kind of stuff.

Speaker 2:          01:10:36       Now here's the funky part that says old almost as the republic. It was called the spoil system in the early 18 hundreds, right? I win election. So all my buddies get jobs, right? Everybody who supported me. So there've been asked though, ever since then, the hatch act was one where they tried to limit that and both parties act like they don't do it anymore. So when it comes out that they still do, people freak out. But here's the truth. If the Democrats do it, I'm sure the Republicans do it too. I'd love to see a list from the last Republican administration who their top donors were. All you have to do is look at who the ambassadors were and especially the ambassadors to good places, right? Who is the ambassador to Bermuda who was the ambassador to London? The UK one is always a coveted position. How much did that guy give and because it's always been the way it is. There's a part of me that goes, Eh, what are you going to do? But the other part of me goes, that's the corruption you wish more Americans knew was built into the system. Right? If you found out that the guy who's in charge of making sure this country safe and the Homeland Security Department got the job because he gave money to get the job, how much less safer we than if you gave it to the most qualified candidate.

Speaker 3:          01:11:48       That's a very important point. And how many people are doing it for vanity positions just so they can say they are that ambassador. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:11:54       London. I just saw a way to reform joe, so all we have to do is get some really rich marijuana grower to give them enough money so that he becomes the Department of Homeland Security Director and you could get that corruption thing working in your favor.

Speaker 3:          01:12:07       That's actually possible with the amount of money that I'm making in Colorado. You never know.

Speaker 2:          01:12:11       You would never direct your homeland security made all of his money growing weed and it comes full circle. How much have you

Speaker 3:          01:12:18       paid attention to? All the controversy about the Clinton Foundation.

Speaker 2:          01:12:25       I have a special relationship with the Clintons. You know, I was in talk radio during that whole administration and there they're relatively unique people as a couple and they're very hard to describe and I always try to be fair. You know, I'm, I'm very into fair and seeing context, but let's be honest. These are two people that, you know, here's the way I look at it. If you're Hillary Clinton and they have been after you since before your husband was president, you know, in Arkansas, they were after them, right? So you know how on you they're going to be. Wouldn't you stay so far away from any lines that nobody could ever come close to saying you were? But they don't. They both walk and straddle and that, you know, if you talked to people in Arkansas, they just say that's the Clintons. They, they walk the straddle the line and a lot of times they go in too much of one.

Speaker 2:          01:13:12       And why would you do that? We talked about this with Anthony Wiener, you and I a long time ago. If you know that stuff's out there, why would you go and run for office again? It's the same thing with Clinton. If you know you're the most watched man in the world, why on earth would you have an affair with a teenage intern who you know will not stay quiet about it? It, it, it boggles the mind. So if you're Hillary Clinton and you've got everyone trying to come up with dirt on you, why would you do anything that was even suspicious and yet they still walk that line. I don't get it. Well, don't you think? I think

Speaker 3:          01:13:44       that first of all, their patterns and their behavior and their attitudes towards things were established in the 19 eighties when the world was a much simpler place. And you can get away with what happened in Mena, Arkansas with all that craziness, with, you know, the dropping drugs out of airplanes. And uh, when, when you know, which is all part of that narco series, narco series, I mean, somebody was in on it. I mean that guy who got shot and killed, who is about to testify

Speaker 4:          01:14:12       for George Bush? What the fuck was his name? I'm convinced. No, no, no, no. The, the pilot. That was the drug pilot. I remember the story of. Dammit. I can't remember the story though. Yeah. So client assessment I into this, obviously some people knew about this. Obviously the CIA was involved. This guy was involved with some cowboys and the CIA. They were bringing drugs in from what they were doing that during the Iran contra thing in the 80. So it's not old news. Yeah, no, it's so somehow or another that was standard operational procedure at least on some level, whether it's rogue, rogue agents and the CIA or rogue people in the government or whoever was profiting on it. And that was also of course, what was, what was going on in south central Los Angeles during the contrast in the center versus the Sandinista. There was a relationship that they were making money by selling drugs in the ghetto and they were taking that money and it was directly affecting global politics in a country that cared about reform.

Speaker 4:          01:15:15       How many of those things have to happen before somebody would turn around and say, okay, we have a big problem and we have to weed that problem, so out of the CIA or whichever agency you want to, you want a name so that it doesn't happen again. When that doesn't happen, know I remember I'm looking into police departments that had problems and in La when I was growing up, you knew which ones to avoid. For example, there was one in Signal Hill and we all knew you don't. You don't want to get pulled over there. So eventually they had to disband the whole police department and start from scratch because every time they tried to reform it, there was a culture in that little police department that absorbed new members and the people that wouldn't become part of the culture ended up transferring out or whatever.

Speaker 4:          01:15:56       And the people that worked with the culture state. That's a microcosm of how all these giant agencies work where, how do you change the culture of something when you would have to get rid of the people who are there now who all bought in or they wouldn't still be there. You know, you were saying about the mainframe computer. If you wanted to start the CIA over today, would you use any of the people that are in it now? It's hard to know because I think if you didn't, you'd end up with an agency that thought, listen, we're keeping America safe and if we have to dose people with Lsd as happened in the late fifties, early 19 sixties as a way to make sure that our people aren't dosed with Lsd, we're going to do it. You know the pilot was barry seal's. I was trying to remember it.

Speaker 4:          01:16:36       So you're having the same problem by him. A little bit too many goddamn people. Too much stuff in our brain. Too much data. But the. So the Clintons in the 19 eighties, they pretty much were able to get away with pretty much whatever they wanted. I mean, they had so much immense power, right. She's Arkansas, governor of Arkansas. Yeah, but he was a frequent freaks, right. It was just whipping his dick out all over the place. But what's funny is not exactly a pipeline to the White House either. So in that sense it was. It was a little like getting somebody from, you know, Mississippi as your president. It's just a little different. Well, yeah. No, no doubt, no doubt whatsoever, but this time when all this stuff was going on, established their behavior patterns maybe and then will mean Arkansas of course is where the CIA was dropped or someone in the CIA, some rogue agent.

Speaker 4:          01:17:29       I don't think it was like a systemic thing inside the CIA where the top of the CIA was aware of it and condoned it and sanctioned in with someone was bringing in drugs and they bring it in drugs to Arkansas. I don't think it's a coincidence that the fucking governor of Arkansas gets fast track to becoming the president. It's probably in some way related in some some fiber, whether it's. I don't think it's the most important aspect of his governorship, but there's some connection there. It has to be. I'll tell you what though, if you go look at Bill Clinton in the primaries when he was basically chosen to be the Democratic candidate to run against the elder George Bush, and you look at those stiffs he was up against. Yeah. It's how it always is. I mean, when you look and you go, okay, there's a bunch of people who I could never vote for 2 million years and there's one person who's got some charisma.

Speaker 4:          01:18:17       Right? I don't know how it happens that way. I mean, if somebody wanted to say, well, that's the part that's rigged. Listen to the two parties who are private entities that can do whatever they want. Someone said to me the other day, what happens if Hillary Clinton drops out for health reasons? You know who, who naturally does the job devolve to, and I said, whoever the Democratic National Committee wants it too, which is really fascinating. When I was a registered Democrat, they make themselves out to be like a constitutional, a pillar of ours. They're not. They're a private entity that can do what they want and they will do whatever they want if they have to have that comes down to it. So all the people that voted in the primaries for hilary or Bernie or it doesn't mean anything anymore. So now who are you being represented by the king.

Speaker 4:          01:18:57       Just choose someone. I mean, this is what you're down to. You're down to like a monarchy. Well you said the funding, you've talked about the founding fathers earlier and I'm always blown away that Madison, who's the guy who's most responsible for writing the constitution was like 23. I was the most irresponsible, you know, goof off in the world I think at 23. So you look at those guys and you realize how much they had a problem with what they called factions there version of factions is what we would call parties today. And they thought it was poisonous and yet it was like a generation later. And what did they have cropping up factions. So it's, it would be a really difficult thing. It must be an evolutionary natural thing to normally develop in a society like ours, but if you decided that that was the poison pill, what could you write into the founding documents that prevented that?

Speaker 4:          01:19:44       I don't know, but, but to me that's the root of so much of our evil in this country is we have two parties that control a corrupt system and in order to fix the corrupt system, the two parties would have to be on board to do it. Well, okay. That's, that's actually asking what if we said the Fox to redesign the chicken coop? It's the Fox is interest. Well, it's also what we were talking about, whether it's the CIA or the NSA, if you're them to redesign this thing, you're asking relinquished some pants. Right. And to redesign it away where they can't get back into it. Even if they had to do it to save us. I mean that's when it gets really wiggy. If you say, I don't want you spying on us anymore and the next nine slash 11 attack, we have happened because they couldn't spot on us.

Speaker 4:          01:20:22       You better believe they'll point that out. Yeah, and also if you had to redesign it, you would have to eliminate some jobs. I mean there's no way this thing is operating at 100 percent efficiency. So if somebody really audited it, whether it's the CIA or the FBI or the NSA, I mean do 100 percent sure they're doing their best, but there's no way it's done really well. It's just the government, the government fucks up almost everything because most people don't want to work for the government. So who do you get? You got a bunch of people that, well, okay, I'll do that job. It's like, is anybody clamoring to be the guy at the NSA that gets to read Dan Carlin's email? I think I, I think what it is, I'm in a better way to put it as it's the systems decline. I mean it just deteriorates over time and it's, it's.

Speaker 4:          01:21:02       Every system is remarkably hard to go back and fix and the government, especially as you know, we've got 240 years of, of deadwood and you don't often go in there and have a spring cleaning session. You know, and I think the founding fathers were people who were aware, they used to talk about lifespans of countries and so you know that computer analogy we use as a pretty good one. This is an old computer that we've patched many, many times and also tasked to do many, many more things in the constitution ever envisioned because you have a great depression or you have a second world war or you have nuclear weapons appear on the scene, so all of a sudden we have a flexible constitution to deal with unforseeables as you pointed out. Okay. But how flexible is it? I mean at what point have you stretched it so far that it's become a fig leaf?

Speaker 4:          01:21:46       I try to remind people. We did a whole series on the decline and fall of the Roman republic and what a lot of people don't know is that when the Roman Empire first appeared in for a long time afterwards, they kept all the forms. Senators were still elected. I mean, you have an all powerful emperor, but they still went through the process of electing senators as though nothing had changed. They still held elections, they still had people giving money to senators to give them favors, but we had a system in Rome as if I was there, but at that point it was a total dictatorship, but we elected senators anyway because the forms had a long and noble tradition that was tied to the way Roman saw themselves the same way. We're tied to that 19 fifties high school textbook of who we are. If we had a dictator someday, they would never be able to get rid of senators and because the forms are very important. Well, that's one of the biggest fears about the Patriot Act. The Patriot Act two as well, is that if something did happen in martial law was declared, would we really have the same system that we think we have when we have that 19 fifties textbook version of, or would we really have a military dictatorship that's disguised? I just read a book, I think it was called American coup. You know back 20 years ago, people who wrote those books were conspiracy people who had no real. Now the people writing those books are all insiders and they have

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       generals writing blurbs on the back and this guy, it's kind of a boring book because he talks so much about fema and Katrina and all these things, but sometimes when you're diagramming how these things happen, it's not spy thriller type stuff. It's really sometimes run of the mill. We had this problem. We had. His point is that we've been living in a society that's operating between the lines in the constitution for 50 years now and that the government is absolutely petrified about all the threats out there to us and in order to protect us. Things like little writings on hemp paper from 240 years ago are not going to stand in the way of us protecting us from another nine slash 11 or a nuclear bomb going off in a harbor or something like that. When of course, the argument to that is like, of course you're going to say you're protecting us. Of course that's sometimes you are. Sometimes you're not, but how convenient is that? You are also controlling

Speaker 3:          01:24:01       vast amounts of wealth, controlling so much of the ability of the United States citizens to to do their jobs, to get through life, to, to do anything they want to do without being infringed on by this group of people that sort of got elected, got elected in some sort of a weird, strange way in an antiquated system that doesn't really make any sense anymore and there's only really held accountable up to a certain extent. That's one of the weirder aspects about real government corruption because the real corruption as the legal shit like you're talking about the ledger, showing what people did, what and what they received for those donations and how much they gave and how much they got out of it and how they became like that is how is that legal in insider trading is illegal. How is that legal? And Martha Quinn goes to jail, not Martha Quinn.

Speaker 3:          01:24:57       She went, yeah, the MTC zero j from MTV. Martha Stewart rather goes to jail for a stock trade. You know, where she was not honest about the information that she knew about profiting off of stocks rate. It's, it's insane, like the disparity. It's insane how much, how much weird corruption is just entangled into the system that the only way to get rid of what would have to be you would have to stop all those jobs that are, that evolve around all that money coming in and you're dealing with untold millions of dollars and that it's being siphoned from the system by all these people, the lobbyists and all the special interest groups that constantly work in the Washington hive to extract those people. At this point, it's almost impossible without a total reset of the system. Well, I look at how.

Speaker 2:          01:25:49       Look at how things changed. So for example, when the founding fathers set up war powers, which they understood to be the most important thing, they separated the part where we decide to go to war from the power of fighting the war, and they gave the power to fight the war to the president. He's the commander in chief, but they did not give him the power to decide to go to war. Right? That's too much power for one guy. They gave that to Congress. So Congress has the power to declare war once they do. The president has really extreme emergency authority to fight the war. When Harry Truman took us into Korea in 1950, he called it a police action and he called it a police action because you don't need to declare a war to have a police action, but he sent the united. I mean we lost 50,000 guys or something in Korea.

Speaker 2:          01:26:35       Um, and you know, a lot more Koreans. Um, once you do that, we've never declared war again. As a matter of fact, no president even throws that out there, that they would love to have a support, a declaration of support by Congress. But once you do that, you, you break an important wall, the wall that says that the president has basically unlimited powers and more time and now he has the right to decide when war time is okay. That's a firewall that had been built into the system that once it's broken, you can never repair that. You can never go back. Congress has no way to repair that firewall. So now somebody said to me, if donald trump's elected president, can he use a nuclear bomb against a country or could he decide I'm going to scare the heck out of North Korea and I'm going to know drop a bomb off their coast?

Speaker 2:          01:27:18       Yes, and he can do it without asking anybody and the only people that might tell him no. Are the military and the military starts telling the president, no, that's almost as scary as a president that can drop a nuclear bomb whenever he wants to. So that's in the. In the founder's construction of the country. In in their mind, you would have had to have gone to Congress and say, can we drop a nuclear bomb on North Korea? And then Congress would have voted decided and then the president would have been empowered to take whatever measures are necessary. Right? We've that firewall is gone. The president has extreme emergency authority in foreign policy. Now he didn't have to ask Congress for anything. There's only one thing congress can do. They have the power of the purse so they can cut off the funds, but can you imagine our troops say in Iraq or Afghanistan and the congress doesn't want them there anymore, so the choice they have is to stop sending a meals and replacement bullets and it's not going to happen.

Speaker 2:          01:28:12       So those are the ways that the constitution gets destroyed. And Truman, I mean, you look at what we mentioned earlier, the CIA, the NSA, that power truman did more damage to this country and in, in one presidency than anyone I can think of. And, and, and yet I cut him some slack because he did. The world had never existed. It existed in his heart. He had a whole new challenges to deal with. It's like when Obama came into office and promised to undo the extremes of the previous administration, had he done that, we could have said, okay, nine slash 11 happened. We freaked out. And then we fixed it, right? We, we got our balance back. By not doing that, he caught a fight it. Now that's the rule, right? When both parties agree on something, it becomes the way we do things now. So if Truman had left office and Eisenhower had come in as a member of the other party and

Speaker 4:          01:29:02       said, Whoa, the CIA thing is more like an American Gestapo, we're going to get rid of it. Boom. Truman is a blip. But when he decides to embrace the CIA, now that's the way we do business. So if the two parties don't sort of look out for each other and say, listen, nine slash 11 is a one off, strange experience, okay, we understand how somebody could overreact and freak out. We'll fix it and instead say, no, we'll keep things the way they are. Then you take it another step down. Another firewall has been broken in. The constitution has been stretched again, to the point where there were big holes and now is there a fourth amendment anymore really mean there's amendments of the constitution and people will say to me all the time, Dan, you say our freedoms going away. Tell me when we repealed in amendment doesn't work that way.

Speaker 4:          01:29:45       Rome didn't do that, right? They kept the senators, the forms stay, but the reality can be changed mightily. Right? Yeah, and it seems like once it's changed, you know, what is that old saying about a power loss never recovered. It's exactly where, and let's understand something, let's, let's not take the American people off the blame list. If another nine slash 11 happens, they're going to go and call for the heads of the people that voted against spying on, you know, I mean that's how we are. We're such a panicky people that were not willing to suck up a lot of casualties if, if that's what's required to defend some of this stuff. If you're going to say you can't spy on Americans, just understand some nasty Americans are going to get fertilizer bombs and blow up stuff sometimes because they slipped through that protection for you and me and everyone else.

Speaker 4:          01:30:31       Yeah. I wonder if over time, like going back to that battleship analogy, like that's going to be the only thing that clears this up is that the people that started getting elected into office deal with the new level of transparency and the people that are growing up now who will eventually become politicians. They grow up in a different world and so their view of what's possible and not possible is very different than like we were talking about the Clintons who kind of had an open pass to kind of do a lot of shit that they wanted to do back in the 19 eighties and the nineties and they're still kind of operating like when you're talking about Hillary Clinton and the Clintons just kind of doing their thing and it's like if you look at the difference between here's. This is not a conspiracy theory. If you look at the difference between what Hillary Clinton says, the FBI found out about her emails versus what the FBI says about what they found out about Hillary Clinton's emails.

Speaker 4:          01:31:26       Someone's lying and I don't think it's the FBI. Someone's lying. Like her version of it is a lie. It's just not real. Like what she's saying is not what they're saying. What's the assumption built into that though? The assumption is that I know that that's not the real spin that the FBI director put on it and the five percent of Americans who read newspapers know that that's not the spin, but the majority of people that I'm trying to reach will simply hear what I say and if they want to know. And here's the thing. I mean this is like a. We all have. If

Speaker 2:          01:31:59       you want to support that candidate anyway, you're inclined to believe what they say and disinclined to believe what the other guy says. This is part of the problem about the binary, lesser of two evils thing we get into because Hillary Clinton is one of the most unpopular candidates. I mean, I always tell, you know, I have two daughters and they constantly asked me these really uncomfortable questions about why don't we have women presidents and all this kind of stuff. So I'm all in favor of that. And I have a lot of women who say, you know, Hillary Clinton's, uh, uh, the most qualified candidate we've ever had for high offices is all just sexism. And what I try to tell them is, is this really the person you want to be the poster child though, as the first woman president? Because I'll tell you what, if current trends continue, I don't imagine Republicans are going to lay up on her at all, right?

Speaker 2:          01:32:40       The whole, the entire Clinton administration was the Republicans trying to get them for something. So imagine she gets elected. Imagine that they continue to hound her the way they do and remembering that they tend to walk that line, right? Being the Clintons, there's going to be 90 percent of nothing in their travel gates at Rose Hill law firms, but there's going to be something they find eventually they will impeach her for that. And if she's the first woman president to be impeached, how does that help you as the, you know, if the first African American president had been impeached, that wouldn't look very good. Right? And I got to say President Obama, you know, I don't like a lot of stuff he's done, but from a scandal standpoint, he'd been pretty good. You know, by if you grade these people on the curve, his scandal record's been pretty good.

Speaker 2:          01:33:21       If you don't count accidental deaths and drones, that's not a scandal. That standard operating procedure. That is, that's how we do. That's foreign policy baby. That's, that's not a a bug, that's a feature. But it seems like a scandal when people find out the numbers of innocent people killed by drones and how many have. And also the, the real issues with him saying that he was gonna support whistleblowers. Oh yeah. And what they've actually done with and blowers and how hard they've been on the freedom of the press has been a very, very confusing time for a lot of people that were Obama supporters eight years ago. And thought like, I did that. This was the answer. Like finally we have the super articulate young guy who has a view of the world that's similar to us. You know, he said all the right things when he ran for office.

Speaker 2:          01:34:04       And but, but again, what he had said was, we're going to go and overturn the mistakes of the previous administration. Had he done that, he would have reestablished a few firewalls that we ripped apart. It's always interesting to try to theorize why that didn't happen. People love to tell you those stories. Oh, they took him in the back room and they showed him the Kennedy assassination. Said any questions? That's a Bill Hicks bit, but you don't know. Part of you can say, listen, they took him in the back room and said, here are the threats. We stopped last month. Do you really want to do what you say? You know you don't, but you would love the president to at least say, okay, I'm going to hold a televised press conference now and I'm going to say, here is what I said when I ran for president. Here's why I can't do it right when they don't though. Yeah, but what was going to say when they don't do that, you open up the door to what the hell's going on. He gave you this small promise and that small promise and maybe a healthcare reform, but he said he was going to essentially repair

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       the constitution and he didn't. So what's the story? Why? Yeah, it's, it's, it's just so hard to guess and he's not going to tell you. So it's one of those things that we're just gonna all have to debate about to the end of time and then go home. Angry. Well, as everyone says, the what happens when you get the truly, truly without limits candidate into office without those firewalls. Yeah. I mean it's, it's one thing to say, listen to the president can drop a nuclear bomb on anybody wants to legally. It's another thing to have a president who says, you know, I can drop a nuclear bomb. I'll just, you know, we'll do that. It's also hard to understand like when you've seen a guy like trump, I don't want to get back to the Clinton Foundation before I forget, but while were you seeing a guy like trump and you listened to the people that have actually interviewed him or talked to him and have conversations with him?

Speaker 1:          01:35:46       Like one of them was, I forget what, head of military that he was discussing this with what he was talking about, the nuclear option. You can't, we just use nuclear weapons. That line. Yeah. Yeah. Do you, you heard about that, right? And you wonder like what was the tone of that discussion? You know, like, like we're just being curious versus. Yeah, well, or was he being silly? You know what I mean? Maybe look, he's Donald Trump, right? He's a charmer. So he's this public figure. He meets people, he talks to them. He puts on this persona. Obviously a lot of this stuff he says in a lot of ways he's like a comedian because he's saying so many things for effect and whether or not he believes it or not is not the point. The point is they're going to get a big impact. He's going to kill, you know, like.

Speaker 1:          01:36:29       So I told the president of Mexico, the wall just got 10 foot higher. He's doing stuff like that. He's doing lines. Those are punchlines, right? It might not be that funny, but it's got it's a punch and he's saying those in weird places, like he's saying like it's, it's part of what makes him interesting is that he's like this weird entertainer that's hijack the system. And I say interesting. It's like a very generous use of the word. Um, it's, it's scary. But what interests be though we should get these. It's funny because, you know, on twitter, some of the trump supporters, and I don't ever want a broad brush because I know a lot of people that are going to vote for trump that are old people that are, find people that are, you know, but there's certainly a, an, an edge on some of those people that support them, that, that, that has certain racism, all kinds of things.

Speaker 1:          01:37:15       We see them on twitter. And so, you know, when, when one of them was talking about, um, you know, how Donald Trump is this, you know, they conservative is one of the words they like to use. Now you know, all those kinds of this. But, but to me, no American who understands the United States well would want to vote for some strong man. That whole attitude of wanting some strong man figure is unamerican is I can think of. And if you go study your, your Roman republic history, it was the strong men riding in on a white horse that really signaled the beginning of the end. You know, don't, don't anyone who wants too much power and promises to use it to. That's somebody to be afraid of in my book

Speaker 3:          01:37:55       anyway. No, it's definitely not a measured person. I do not want some strong man. Well this is things that he says that you know, that he's just trying to get a reaction. Like what, what did he say about Mccain as that he, he likes people that didn't get caught. I know like, what the fuck are you saying? When he was basically a guy who get five deferments or whatever it had that's a, you know, he'll say, well what else does that? But it's also what he does. He says those outrageous things. He hits those punches. Will someone's raping him, you know he's got like these punchlines was up against on the primary stage with a bunch of stiff robotic people repeating talking points. It was a little like Clinton wasn't his primary is in, in, in, in the early nineties when when it's a bunch of deadbeats, stiff cardboard cutout pretend figures and one person that you don't know what they're going to say next and that becomes interesting.

Speaker 3:          01:38:46       But what's interesting is the charismatic type people that we are so attracted to really are not what you want as a leader. You don't want that person that needs so much attention that they polish their persona to a point where they're incredibly influential because a lot of that persona, a lot of that when you're seeing is it's like they're entertainers. I mean that's what it is. When you're a really charismatic person, you've figured out a way to speak in a way that people like you more and then you've. You've exercised that to the point where it's a well honed muscle with incredible endurance and you have a great sensitivity to how people are perceiving you so you know how to come across as noble and patriotic and brilliant and you know, we all know that some of the things that people say like standard things that people say, there's some of them that you really shouldn't even be able to say anymore because it doesn't mean anything and shouldn't be allowed to just hijack those words and just use it to gain merit.

Speaker 3:          01:39:39       Like God bless our troops. I don't know what the fuck do you mean? What do you mean by the national anthem? When people freak out over that, I always say, listen, I'd be nice if we freaked out a little bit about what these songs and flags and symbols represent instead of freaking out over the symbol and ignoring the stuff. Exactly. Well, I'll tell you when we're talking about a person who's an incredible position of influence and they're saying these things that are kind of not like a real sentence. It's not really what you thought. You just knew that other people have said that it's something you say, so you're saying it, but you're saying it about a very important thing. You're saying about the young people, the children, of all the people that are here, the 18 year old kids that are sent over there to shoot people they've never met and you're saying, God bless those people.

Speaker 3:          01:40:22       Who is. What is God? Are you saying the invisible man in the sky with the harp? Is that who you're. So you're saying God bless our kids to go kill other people's kids? Are you sure that that's how you want to say that? Like you just wanted to have this open statement, God bless our troops to do I want our troops to be safe? Of course do what do I wish that we didn't have to use them? We didn't have to have. Absolutely. It's not a. not a negative in any way, shape or form towards the military, but it's these expressions that leaders are just. They are freely to plug into.

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       It's like a happy birthday to you or like a weird like youtube. You're dealing with massive issues that are super, like not just charged, but the consequences of being wrong or right, or being unsuccessful or massive to just gigantic. You mentioned something I, I've always found very interesting, which is, which is the charisma of the individual. I had a, uh, a poly sci professor back in college who happened to be a German guy, so he was sort of viewing our system from outside our system. And he said, you know, this is how I used to take such a problem with you Americans, is you have a president that combines two jobs. If you were a European country, that would be two jobs. One is the bean counter guy, the one you were mentioning how you want to be president, the one that you know, he's maybe not so great at the big speeches and you don't want that guy going to the funerals and representing America.

Speaker 2:          01:41:43       And he goes. And then we have in Europe, chancellors or presidents that these people physically represent the soul. They go to the funerals. So he said, you want John Wayne to be that guy and then you want some bean counter to be the other guy, but in your country you require both of those things in the same person. He says, do you know how often you get John Wayne who is also a bean counter? He goes, that's your problem. He goes, you end up usually electing the John Wayne and wishing you had a bean counter. So I mean in Europe. He said, those are two separate jobs. It's a good point. It's a good point. What I was getting at by the expressions is like saying things like, God bless the troops or God bless America. Is that just the whole way of talking as a politician is so it's so false and so accepted that we know that they're going to stand in front of all these people with this preplanned out speech that is like this weird rally, this weird artificial strip club, Dj voice that they put on.

Speaker 2:          01:42:40       You know what I mean? It's like, but this is why trump was so even to me attractive early on because he exposed what happened to Rubio was a perfect example. If you remember the primary debates with trump and rubio, rubio kept repeating the talking points, so then Christy among other people said, that's a talking point and you keep saying it and then he said it again two more times. Almost proving that this is all scripted to the fun part of Donald Trump. Earlier on. Was he exposed all of that is you sometimes get the feeling that he didn't prep it all right. I mean there was. You didn't know what he was going to say. I loved trying to imagine the dilemma. You know before these debates, they always have someone stand in for the other candidate. Who Do you get to stand in for trump if you're like when Hillary Clinton practicing her debates who sits there and because I mean because you don't know median or something, but the point is is that, is that that was the fun.

Speaker 2:          01:43:31       He exposed kind of the, the, the artificial Kabuki theater sort of way. This has developed and I liked that because I think it's good when more Americans see what it really is, right? In other words, most of the time you're right. They either get fooled by that or they've heard it so many times they don't even pay attention. Trump helped expose that. So in that sense, that was good for the system. Of course, now we've gone quite a bit farther down that road and uh, and I don't think it is so good for the system anymore. I do think anybody who would beat Hillary Clinton almost. I mean, I think, you know, Democrats keeps saying to me, if you don't vote for Hillary Clinton, you're going to put trump in office and that'll be your fault. And I keep saying it's not my fault. You put Hillary Clinton up as your candidate.

Speaker 2:          01:44:10       I mean, in 2008, we saw how unpopular she was. She shouldn't have lost a Barack Obama. She was going to be correlated. Then you realize if she hadn't had a 70 something year old democratic socialists who, let's be honest, does not have a ton of charisma and a guy. Nobody's ever heard from her. Only two primary challengers up on that stage. She wouldn't be here if Joe Biden and it's the first time I can think of that. A vice president hasn't tried to run him. If Joe Biden had run, he would be up against trump now and I don't think trump would stand a chance to be honest, and I don't like Joe Biden, but I just think he's a zero and right now trump is a negative running against Hillary who's a negative zero kicks. Both their rear end.

Speaker 3:          01:44:49       Yeah, and he's also a zero who's had no negative consequences of eight years in office, really? Which is amazing because he's known for gaffes. Yeah, he's a goofy dude. Well, we used to have this thing in Boston and stitches comedy club. We'd call it Joe Biden tonight. This was 1988 malarkey. He's an Irish guy. Would steal other people's material. That's what you would do like I feel. Yeah, because people don't know, but biden plagiarize Kennedy's speeches when he was running for president and was a big deal. I recall everybody's Kinda forgot about that, but he lived, literally just stole giant passages out of. That's something we look back on now and go, ah, the good old days when that was the only thing we could slam somebody for. Well, they're still doing it like didn't Mellinia or how did he say? Or she stole a. She claimed she didn't, but it's a remarkable coincidence. Well, it's Michelle Obama's exact words, isn't it? So what are the odds? She didn't write that shit anyway. Somebody I wouldn't be surprised and someone brought this up and it wasn't me, but someone suggested it and I think they're probably right that trump did it on purpose and plagiarized Michelle Obama speech so that people would talk about it so it would give even more attention to his campaign. I love that.

Speaker 2:          01:45:54       Trump questions like Michael Moore of all people came out with a piece about three weeks ago and he started the piece off by saying something to the effect of, you don't have to believe what I'm about to tell you, but I will tell you that I have spoken to people who are in the know who tell me that trump doesn't even want this gate, that this is something that has gotten out of control, that this was more of a, I'll get a TV series afterwards and then he didn't expect you to do this, and I thought to myself, okay, I don't know that I believe that, but if that's true, this is the most unusual, funky, weird American political history story I've ever heard.

Speaker 3:          01:46:30       I think it's the last gasps of a dying empire. I just don't think you can continue the way they've been doing it. I think this is showing us that there are no good representatives. There's, there's no good candidates. There's no way. We didn't know about them. If they were there, they would know about them. I mean, maybe there's some young

Speaker 4:          01:46:50       that are coming up and there's some young congress people that are coming up maybe. Well this was in Lawrence lessig spoke book, a republic loss, which by the way, if anyone wants to go check out, he put it on the Internet for free now so you can read it. And one was the Harvard maybe. Um, so, so, but one of the things he said in that it was so interesting because he showed how people who are getting started, you know, running for mayor, you know, the low level things, how the parties begin the weeding out process. And the first thing that they want to know is how good are you at raising money? And this determines whether or not the party, let's this mayoral candidate put the Rod after their name or that may oral cancer. So in other words, from the very beginning, one of the main qualifications is how good are you at raising money?

Speaker 4:          01:47:32       Okay? So fast forward to when that guy or woman is up on the stage running for president. And then they have four other elected positions leading up to that. All of which require you to be a better fundraiser when that's one of the number one qualifications required for the parties to let you progress. Then what do you end up with at the end of the line? Mean what are the carrots and sticks that they're looking for? A little bit different than maybe what you and I as voters are looking for. That's why trump is such a weird one, right? Because he's a guy who has so much money. He funded allegedly, allegedly. People like that. He obviously has money credit. He got really good credit. I mean he gets sell some of his shit and he would have money. He owned some of that stuff. It seems like it does have a lot of stuff and maybe as money is wrapped up in a lot of that stuff.

Speaker 4:          01:48:16       I guess. I don't know. I'd like to stop voting for 70 year old people and it's not an age is kind of thing, but as a person who just mentioned to you that at 50 I'm starting to forget things. I can only imagine what I'll be like in 20 years. Well, I said that about Hillary Clinton and people call me sexist. They were like that sex. I'm like, she's an old lady. Trump is. He's an old man. That's right. If you could watch those TV shows from like the 19 fifties and you see their portrayal of a 70 year old sitting on the porch falling asleep and widdling. That's what this is. Seventy may be the new 60, but 68 grade either. Well, it's definitely not the prime of your cognitive abilities. It's not the primary. This level may be good, but your bas speed is terrible.

Speaker 4:          01:48:58       Yeah. There you go. Again, with the bus that trump trump, I mean doesn't even have experience, so it's even more bizarre. So it's not like you're dealing with this elderly statesman that has so much knowledge and so much so much invested in our system of government and really believes in it so much that he wants to lead this country and make America great again. Now you've got a super rich guy who's famous for going, you're fired. And when trump supporters say, well, he'll pick the best people. I always want to point out, you know, he's already shown some of the people that he likes and there's the same old group of people you had before, but he's not going and picking other business people who've now he goes and finds this and you're going, okay, it's the same group, so I get Donald Trump presiding over the same old group of people who've been wrong about everything so far.

Speaker 4:          01:49:41       I mean that's the problem is that how do you get away from the people who are consistently wrong in a merit system? The people that should be promoted are the ones who are right. More often. We don't get that. We have the same faces forever for A. I mean the same guys who are, who are on, I always say on if CNN is going to put to just name one these experts to tell us what this latest North Korean nuclear missile thing, these would you please put up their track record the way you would put up the wins and loss record of a manager in baseball. Do you want that manager who's who's four and 72 explaining to you the world series strategy, or are you going to say, this guy doesn't know Jack, because if they put the records of these people they have on the programs, you'd look at it and go, I'm not listening to this guy.

Speaker 4:          01:50:24       He's consistently wrong. Yeah, but once someone becomes someone that people recognize in that regard, you're an expert. You're in the Rolodex a quote. That's right. It's just. It's a weird time. I think it is the weirdest time ever in politics. I don't think there's ever been anything weirder than this. Well, let me show you what. What bothers in independent like yours truly. If you look at the demographics of the United States, the independence or actually the last poll I saw were a slight majority now, so divide the pie into three Democrats, Republicans and everybody else, which is what the independents are winning. We're not a party. We don't have a candidate we could agree upon, but we're everyone else where the king makers in this election, right? Then you watch a TV and watch CNN or Fox and they have 10,000 analysts talking about politics on there on election night and everything else and half of them are democratic operators, operatives and half a Republican operatives.

Speaker 4:          01:51:15       Where the heck is anybody who could speak for that giant slice of the pot and you would think that that common sense would dictate you would grab some people, right? What our independence thinking. Instead they asked Democrats and Republicans and independents are thinking, and I'm not saying that because I have a point. I'm saying that because it confounds me, get. It seems pretty straightforward. It seems like if CNN or any of these news networks decided to help support this independent idea and bring in independence and and show that that independence or the vast majority of the voters are, or the majority of the slight majority of majority of the voters in America. If they showed that and promoted that idea and people that people would go, wow, I didn't know that. Not that kind of reporting in on it like that. And I think they're complicit because they have relationships with the people that they know that where's the money, the money is interviewing and getting on camera.

Speaker 4:          01:52:08       The people that are the most popular right now and most likely to win. That's why one of the most amazing things that trump did was all that shit dog. And he did talk about Mexicans being rapists and all this nuts about the wall and all the. All the different crazy things that he said when he did that, the news was forced to cover him. They were forced to. They liked it as long as we were still in the primary stage. Yeah. They thought there's no way this guy's gonna win. Everybody said that there's no way this guy's gonna win. Right? I said that. Yeah. One of the people that said, well, he's now neck and neck with Hillary and the national polls. I will say this. And, and, and, and didn't I just say you shouldn't listen to people who have a bad track record. So I was wrong about that. So bear that

Speaker 2:          01:52:46       in mind. Oh, and one on my trump analysis on how far he'll go. So just be fair. Um, but you know, when you look at the American electoral system, like a, an analyst does, they notice important states. You have to win, right? This state has to, you know, as Ohio goes or as Florida, there's certain places, and then there are other places that are gimmes. This state will always go blue. This state will always go red. So the battle ground are the, are the states that are the toss ups in a bunch of those states. Hillary Clinton is leading. And so the attitude that the sharpies at least have is that it doesn't matter what the polls look like, it matters how Ohio goes and it matters how Florida, you know. So in other words, those are the choke points that the real sharpies work from for you.

Speaker 2:          01:53:30       I mean, when Hillary Clinton decides four years ago, I'm going to run for president, okay, get into Ohio now. Start working those places now. And so when people talk about trump not having a robust establishment or organization on the ground, this is where he's going to get killed. They'll kill him in those states and then he may, when you know, you could conceivably come up with an election where trump gets more actual votes, but Clinton wins the electoral college and winds the key states and that's how the sharpies who do this for a living as, as consultants and as campaign strategist, that's how they, when they find those places, I think when you see her fainting at that nine slash 11 thing, when they're trying to walk her to the car and she starts bad timing on that, huh? All of a sudden drudge looks like a nostradamus in that, doesn't it?

Speaker 2:          01:54:16       Yeah. Well it's, it's terrible to see. It's terrible to see that she's in such poor health that she starts just falling down. I got to tell you though mean you know you, you could do it because you're in good shape. If I had tried to do what either one of those two people had done in terms of what their schedule has been like, I would die 100 percent height and major drinking problem. I'd be drinking too much caffeine. I've been drinking too much alcohol. I'd be. I'd take up smoking. I don't know what I do, but I mean what we require those people to do with this permanent campaign that goes on forever and these are 70 year old people. As we said. I'm amazed they both haven't broken down and if I'm trump I would look at this and go, do I really want this?

Speaker 2:          01:54:54       If this is how hard the job will be, I could be in Hawaii. I could be. I could be. They do. They all go gray. What's going to happen? Know trump is great, let's be honest. Right, but how much is a 70 year old guy going to age when he looks at how old the presidents getting those jobs? I think trump's going to sleep in. He's going to hire people to do all the dirty work. He was just going to just get on the Internet and go, you're fired. You have a youtube channel who knows, you know, that is a part of you that would love to just have a view of what it, you know, like a Gilligan's island episode where you have a dream sequence. The coconut hits you on the head and you imagine what I would, you know, I don't want to live through it, but I'd love to see it for a minute to see what it would look at. Hillary Clinton will just be more of the same. That's the. We're heading towards an iceberg here and she's one of the people that set the course. So that's my problem with her. She's, she's doubling down on what always had.

Speaker 4:          01:55:44       Whereas trump is, is the wild card. I mean you just don't know. Well, like you said, there's a lot of intelligent people that support trump, but man, there's a lot of assholes that support trump. Lady that got punched in the face at a trump rally. Can you explain to me, and I've talked about this in a couple of shows. Another thing that I'm having a bad track record myself, maybe you shouldn't listen to me at all, but, but on the racism thing, which I don't, I don't ever want to put a number on what percentage of the trump supporters fall into that category that we see twitter people trolling us on, but, but I thought that was going the way of the Dodo. I am more surprised by that than anything else that the rise in overt and, and I don't even want to say racism, but just people who look at the world with that, that viewpoint, that Lens.

Speaker 4:          01:56:27       I thought we were, you know, not evolving but, but like I thought those people were dying out. I thought they were like, right. She bunkers and they were just going to be. And to see that recur is the biggest surprise I've had in my adult lifetime. I think when analyzing politics. Well, they absolutely still exist. The question is have they diminished in numbers? I think they have, but if you're just dealing with social media, there's so many voices. So many people have a voice. If you're dealing. This is one of the ways that I've always tried to describe how many retarded people that are on the country, and I don't mean people with down syndrome. I'm not. I'm not going to not stop using that word. It's not a medical term. It's doesn't mean people with the disease. It's almost fucking moron. Okay, okay. If there's 300 million people in this country, one out of 100 is going to be a fucking idiot.

Speaker 4:          01:57:13       At least 100. Really, really, really nice. Really Nice. That's 3 million fucking idiots just in this country that is a fucking gigantic. Minneapolis size city, twitter, morons, and tweet a lot and they could just be racist and sexist or just trying to get a rise out of us or only have a 10 year old kids. I mean, that's the other thing. Some of these are kids who think, okay, that most shocking thing I can say is some racist term. I'm not supposed to say. Of course there's all the above because young kids like I would have done when I was 17, if you gave me a computer when I was 17, but I knew I could tweet to Al Gore. I'd probably make the meanest fucking tweet. I would try to be funny. Yeah. You know, I just think there's, there's so many voices out there that when you see racism attached to the Donald Trump campaign and you know, like you can't really say what percentage of Donald Trump supporters or is it more of a problem in the trump campaign and the hillary campaign?

Speaker 4:          01:58:12       Yes. Does the, he does the fact that he won't take it head on, you know, when they, I was gonna say you can see the reporters try to sort of frame the questions so that he has to either go left or go right on this, you know, uh, would you, uh, would you denounce the KKK and David Duke support? What did he say? I don't know what the KKK is or something like that, but he came up with some answer that. Can you look that up? Because I don't know. I don't want to, I don't know. I'm going to get 10,000 angry. He should go with the really easy stuff like slavery. Good or bad, Donald, it's

Speaker 3:          01:58:42       just real easy stuff. Just give me your position on that. Okay. Let's work from their civil war. Good idea. Bad idea. You know what?

Speaker 2:          01:58:51       Oh God. I just had this moment outside of my body where I thought we're really talking about this stuff and you know, that there is, and you know, you had brought this up earlier and I wanted to point out we had talked about, uh, people growing up, young people today and whether or not they're going to go back, in other words say, oh, this is all so far beyond where we should go back. Or if they're going, this is the new normal to them. To them, they don't even remember when Dan Carlin talks about the laws of the fourth amendment, they're going, what? You know, I don't even remember what you were saying. You know, God, that'd be crazy to let people do that or whatever. I mean, you wonder if, if once you haven't had a freedom for a while, does it seem radical to go back to that?

Speaker 2:          01:59:30       There was a great quote, I use it all the time by a historian a longtime ago named Charles Austin beard, and he said to be considered a dangerous radical today, all you have to do is go around spouting the phrases of the founding fathers that'll get you on the NSA watchlist today. What does it mean? You know, if you, if you, if you, if you take that out, so smacking the mic. But if you take that out and you try to analyze that, what does that say about how far we've come, you know, revolutionaries create your country and then we very quickly lose that revolutionary ardor and we become much more conservative, which is natural I think. But you know, we'd talked about life cycles of countries. Are we over the hill? I mean, could you make a case that the United States concept, which is really a utopian one, this, we can all be free. We can all run the cut. Is that something that is past its prime? It's sell by date.

Speaker 3:          02:00:20       Well I think the the corrupt amongst us have tried to whittle away at it like you're talking about the fourth amendment or the second amendment or even the first amendment. Any the amendments were you look at the freedoms that people were really worried about losing and when something like the Patriot Act or the Patriot Act gets passed and you realize that they can just sorta detain you and they don't have to charge you with anything and they can detain you indefinitely if they just decide. They don't have to present you with any evidence. They don't have to give you a trial. They don't have to give you a court date. Like, well, okay, well what are we operating under? Then if you have, if you can make an act like that and that sort of dissolves the constitution and the bill of rights for people who you decide are the bad guys. If you can just do that, then we don't really have the protection of the constitution and the bill

Speaker 2:          02:01:14       were talking about earlier the corruption where you'd mentioned the second amendment. Why isn't the second amendment is in as much trouble as the fourth, for example, an IRA? Because there's money, right? There's some money on one. There's an industry. That's right. That's right. And so and listen, I'm okay with that. I mean if you're gonna, if you're going to to to create a group and get a lot of money to defend an amendment to the constitution. Even if Americans argue what the second amendment means, but I love the idea of money coming to legislators because that's what they pay attention to to protect those rights. My problem is that the amendments that are getting shafted are the ones that don't have a lot of money and often have a lot of money on the other side. Yeah. Well it's just bizarre that you could get so much done with money and that this is our system of government and it's slowly but surely crept its way into the root system of it and just entangled it and choked it down and natural though.

Speaker 2:          02:02:07       I mean, I think. I think that that basically this is the way it always is and we would have had to have held it back with all of our force to keep it from doing it because money has a way, doesn't it? I mean we all, we all are vulnerable. Once you have enough money so that you don't have to be vulnerable. It's different, but I mean if you are just a person struggling to get by and somebody who offer somebody offers you a lot of money to do something, it is a heck of a challenge to have, okay, here are my philosophical beliefs. Here's food for my children or whatever. That becomes very difficult and with these legislators, the PD is that they all want to be reelected so much that they can let the money sway them. Though if they didn't care that much about the jobs, the money might not mean that much.

Speaker 2:          02:02:47       That once you get elected, if you said this is all I want, then you don't care what the money says. You only care what the money. He says if you want to get reelected, which argues for term limits and all that stuff maybe. Yeah, no, you're right. You're right. It's just, boy, it is daunting when you sit down and talk about it like this. I know I always come in here and bring you down. I'm sorry. I do whatever you want to have a guest after me to cleanse your palate is what he said about David Duke. David Duke is a bad person who had disavowed numerous occasions over the years. Trumps had an MSL. This is not the first time though. This is after he got slammed for not doing enough to disavow. So in other words, this is like the, the follow up question in the fall.

Speaker 2:          02:03:24       So the first time he said something like, I don't want to miss quarter, but I recall him saying something like, I don't know anything about the KKK or something like that. And everybody lost their minds. But if you, if you said to yourself, okay, five percent of my support is from people who would like a guy like David Duke. I'm not going to cut out five percent of my support. I don't know. The whole thing is surreal to me a little bit. Once again, you know, if I've been caught off guard by anything, I've been caught off guard by this and I can't process it yet. I don't know how to. I don't know how to fit Donald Trump and that one segment of his supporters into my worldview because I thought they were a dying breed. I didn't think that could be resurrected. I talked to a guy when I was a reporter during the Bosnian war and he was a Croat and he tried to make the case to me and he very well might have been right that a lot of those people in that area where they have historic problems with each other and always have.

Speaker 2:          02:04:17       We're getting along just fine. While economic things were okay when he said we were intermarrying, you know, serves could fall in love with Croats. It was, it was going okay, but he goes, once everything hit the fan and times became tough and the economics came into play. All those old feelings came back and I thought to myself, is that something that is applicable

Speaker 4:          02:04:39       on this racism thing? I don't. I don't know, but one could make a case that we haven't been this unsettled in a very long time in this country. Are we seeing A. I dunno. It's hard to factor how much that plays a role versus how much the Internet and the ability for these people to speak out when before they would have had to be xeroxing things and leaving them on your car. You know when you come out of the grocery store, did you ever get one of those things come into the grocery store? He has some racist track on your car window or something. You never got to raise this one, but I've got ones for carwashes. What about the tony allow you ever get the one that Tony Alamo ones. He was famous. He Tonio Lama. He ran his own religious thing. Here is something that you used to have people twice a week.

Speaker 4:          02:05:15       I'd have that on my car, but in the old days that's how somebody had to do it. Now they have a broad class platform. Are we just hearing from these people more because they can speak to more people while they also can find likeminded group. That's true. I mean you couldn't find that many likeminded groups. If you lived in a neighborhood full of progressive people and you were like a really conservative person, it'd be really kind of difficult for you to. True. You'd have to seek these people out and now it's with a couple clicks of the mouse and all of a sudden, boom, you're on some website or a bunch of people who agree with you and wind each other up. Everybody winds up, by the way, let's not pick sides. That happens on all sides. Get to go to the daily coast and places like this.

Speaker 4:          02:05:53       Hey, wind people up and they also. They're apologists and they're not honest about the faults of their. Like there was this thing about Hillary, about, like I said, it was people were talking about how it's sexist that people are commenting on her health and that if it was a, a man that was running for president who got week during nine slash 11 during, you know, after some sort of a service for the fallen troops that that would be totally acceptable. Like that's not true. No history shows it because people forget that they, uh, George mcgovern had to drop his vice presidential candidate because the guy who had been released that he had visited a psychiatrist for some shock shock therapy. That's right. Yeah. He had on more than one occasion had electroshock therapy, right? Because he was a fucking loon and he's not. Well, maybe he wasn't Joe Rogan.

Speaker 4:          02:06:42       Maybe you're just playing into the propaganda, get shocked to fix your brain. And then a couple of years later running, there's only one way to find out that's true. I mean, maybe getting shocked is awesome. You know what? Maybe the shark color was in the, in the hands of voters, we can get something done in this country. One more time. The president makes a wrong move. Dick Cheney, I'd love to have a shock button. There's a couple of people. John Bolton, I'd love a shock, but I think a lot of the people that are really excited about hillary becoming president are excited because it would be a first, first time a woman. I would like that aspect of it myself. Yeah, and it would make a. is make us feel like we're progressing, that we can find the best candidate in that regardless of sex. The real question isn't that the real question is, is that the best we can do?

Speaker 4:          02:07:29       Because if that's the best woman we've got, that's crazy. That doesn't make any sense. She's the most qualified. She's also under to criminal investigation simultaneously. She's also like, I'm not a conspiracy theorist for the most part, but how many people have died that have crossed them? I don't go there. Have you ever seen it? Yeah. What's the number? I don't know, but I'll tell you. I'll tell you this. Here's where I go. I go to a much more concrete place, which is look at who she's speaking to and look at who she's raising money from and look at what they released, the transcripts and those banks. Oh, see. And to me that she shouldn't have, she shouldn't have a choice in that. Right? How is it possible? She does, but because she keeps it a secret, what does that encourage? Joe Rogan leaks, right hand hackings.

Speaker 4:          02:08:12       And so if you didn't keep that a secret, you could legitimately say, listen, there are certain things that the public should know when you keep things from the public that they should know. A lot of the public goes, well, the heck with that. That ought to be elite. You know, it's almost like the trying to hold back as many leaks as possible before November just until it's too late. Exactly. We've got to hold it back once she's in. She's in. But there's so many leaks now. It's just, it's getting so strange. When I quoted in the last program I did, I think it was a Dana milbank column. Um, he had talked about one of the recent links that say, okay, don't get hassled by Russian hackers all the time, or people that are mad that I could talk about Russian hackers or what, sorry dudes, I know so, so, but, but, but milbank had said that these people had had hacked the records and then release them, but they also had altered something and then released that version two and so they trip themselves up so that you could compare these are the documents they hacked.

Speaker 4:          02:09:10       Then these are the ones that they released to the public and they had altered something. And I said, everyone, when they found that story out, breathe a sigh of relief because now you have an out and you see it already. The DNC is going well, listen, Russian hackers are known to alter this stuff. So the minute that came out, it was the greatest boon to all the politicians in the world because they can say whatever that says is probably altered. You know, so it, it's, it's the wonderful get out of jail free card on the. Well that is true, but it's legitimate to. Because if they really did that well, that is a get out of jail free card. So now the hacking is just muddied the waters even more. It certainly has. I mean I would actually probably support a hack if I was running for president in that in that sense, because you could say, look, you're not going to trust evidence that came from someone who got it through illegal means and they are doing it.

Speaker 4:          02:09:57       Why would we trust that the hackers would be the only ones who wouldn't distort the emails? What do you got here? Column. Did you confirms leaked emails? Are you see what he said in his emails? Oh my Quinton's out Dick and girls. He also talked about Hillary Clinton and Hubris and all those kinds of things, which, you know, I mean I think. I think that's the impression she gives. So it's interesting to hear that people who know and liker feel a little of that too is also very suspicious. But she has already said, we have this phrase, I would rather not have to vote for her. Although she is a friend. I respect a seven year old person with a long track record, unbridled ambition, greedy, non, not transformational with a husband still dicking Bimbos at home. Holy Shit. Holy Shit. First of all, how dare he use the term Bimbos?

Speaker 4:          02:10:49       I am triggered. You're not supposed to use that term. That's a derogatory term towards. Never come out though. So he's coming for a guys had retard 40 minutes ago. Oh boy. But that's what I'm saying. I'm going to get some blowback from this Joe Rogan. You know that for real? Yeah. Stop hanging out with. I know it's probably bad for you. I know it is bad for me. Nah. How can a guy like Colin Powell or even Hillary Clinton have all of this stuff written in emails? Like are they that out of touch that this stuff is being tracked or like they should know that it's being tracked. I think they felt like they could get away with a lot more than they can get away with and I think again, we're talking about people who grew up and started behaving a certain way way before there was this level of transparency.

Speaker 4:          02:11:30       You're thinking they should behave differently. That's not how these people are. They're thinking now how can I not use that email problem again? They change you behavior change the behavior they want to change is using email. That's the behavior. They're just thinking that they sort of adapted to the times. That was the political landscape back then. I think the political landscape today is just way different. You have to literally literally thank everybody is watching everything you say. We talked about Clinton and and and, and women Kennedy. The press knew that Kennedy was doing all that stuff, but there was an unwritten gentleman's agreement that you didn't talk about that kind of stuff. Nevermind. That he might've been having sex with, with Sam Giancana, his girlfriend, judith exner at the same time, and that there might be some problems with that nowadays. I mean, that's why to me, you know, people say Bill Clinton was just impeached over sex in my mind, anybody who's either dumb enough or whatever name you want to put in there that he thinks he can get away with, that is somebody I don't want with the hand on the nuclear button.

Speaker 4:          02:12:24       I mean, come on. Anybody with half a brain knows. I mean, Joe, if you wanted to get away with something, which you pull that one, I mean, come on. There's no way he was 100 percent going to get caught and did it anyway. That's not good judgment. Well, that kind of guy who becomes president is usually a deck. Sullinger no domestic George. I don't think the elder George Bush falls into that category and maybe he not prudent. Maybe. Maybe he didn't explain, but maybe he did. Maybe that explained his wife. Like she's just hanging out and he was like, Hey, I'm going to go dixon. He was a fighter pilot. I never knew a fighter pilot who wasn't a little bit, you know, get around. Yeah, they're savages. Savage. You want them that way, but living on the edge, but those are going to get all the fighter pilots right in me. See, I mean this is a terrible show for good men. Those fighter pilots, they're great men. There was a high incidence of swinger behavior. Was that, was that the fifties and sixties or was that the fighter pilot who was a um, there was a study done. No, it was a conversation between this guy and a fighter pilots about the high incidences of swingers and one of the things that I think they were saying, I forget where I read this, but there were saying that what was going on was that these guys were in such

Speaker 3:          02:13:31       an intense job where there's a high likelihood of them dying and one of the ways to ensure that their loved one would be looked after is if someone loved them as much as they loved them. So they would literally be in these fighter runs with these planes flying into hostile territory. Getting shot at thinking any day could be my last day. So this desperation of like you're leaving behind a wife and a family. And they one way they alleviated that this was the, the idea was that they would wife swap and that it happened naturally. You know who it was. I think it was Chris Ryan. I think it was Chris Ryan there was explaining this light. Chris Ryan. Yeah. I'm pretty sure it was him. I'm now. I'm now. I'm like reasonably sure. But that kind of makes sense because when you're someone who's every day world is life and death on a level that a fighter pilot is.

Speaker 3:          02:14:25       I mean that is that. See the risk taker thing where you said these are people who live on the edge because that's there when you. You fly those planes, you're a risk taker. If you wanted to say, okay, a person who is willing to do risky behavior here. I'm not thinking of the wife swapping as much as, as having a lot of girlfriends that aren't even a wife, but, but at the same time, listen, like you said, some of those personality traits are probably what you want in those guys. Yeah. Well, I think with the way Chris was explaining it to was that their bond and their comradery between each other was so powerful that it's sort of a, it's sort of the clips, jealousy in a way, you know, because they counted on each other so much and they were brothers in war and literally life or death struggle.

Speaker 3:          02:15:09       So there a bond and a comradery that sort of superseded everything and that the idea of like they could swap wives and they just love each other more. It's kind of crazy. So I go with the outcomes rather that they're more like pro athletes and they're just, they're just wall or, or just there. There's this swagger you'd mentioned. The swagger, right? It's all part of the, of what kind of keeps them. The kind of guys that can be fighter pilots, you know, maybe it'll come with the territory. Maybe it's a bunch of those things too, you know, let's be honest, there were fighter pilots who never did anything like that. Absolutely. Given the get out of jail free pass, that's my Dan Carlin get in the car listening to his podcast. He's guys are assholes, assholes. Why do you listen? Fighter pilots are swingers youth pizza.

Speaker 3:          02:15:56       You know, what just happened? A bunch of wives turned to their x fighter pilot husbands and says, honey, that didn't involve you. Did it wife swap in a new reality show, wife swap and fighter wife swap and fighter pilots, you know, for those who have not seen all of the appearances I've had on this. Joe started off, you know, breaking me into being on the Joe Rogan podcast with some, some, uh, some comments initially. So now I just flow with it and it's gonna get me killed eventually, but it's not gonna do anything mad. It's a conversation with this. This is just like, if you and I went out to dinner in between bites of food, we would have probably the same conversations about stuff. Funny. What, what do you like when you see what the reports are about the Clinton Foundation? I don't totally understand what's legal and what's not legal, but I don't think I've seen anyone said that anything they've done is illegal. Right?

Speaker 2:          02:16:48       It skirts. Yeah. It falls into that category. The same category that, um, maybe the giving of ambassadorships to people who give money fall into the, for example, the clinic. There's no question that the Clinton Foundation goes and does good work. There's no question, but how much does the fact that they do good work and that your name is attached to it ended up being something that helps you for less charitable reasons, right? In other words, it makes you look good as a candidate to be somebody that you know, helps vaccine people against polio. Right? So all of that right there has a subsidiary effect that you could, if you wanted to say, oh, you're, you're benefiting from this will now add the fact that you know, people can give money to the foundation. Then the foundation can pay Bill Clinton to run the mean. It becomes. And then if you gave money to the foundation, does that mean you get special treatment?

Speaker 2:          02:17:40       I can hear the Hillary Clinton supporters saying, well, that didn't happen, but it's the reason that people put stuff in a blind trust when they become president so that you don't even know what your money's doing. So that you can't possibly be favoritism toward one and, and the Clintons have basically made it sound like they're not going to do that. And once again, as I said to you earlier, if you know they're after you, like thereafter the Clintons, wouldn't, you just get leave as much room between you and any potential width of scandal as you could, but they don't. I don't know why they don't, but they don't Ken, that maybe they can't

Speaker 3:          02:18:17       at this point, you know, how could they, they probably are so and all those other people that have been a part of all that stuff for so long.

Speaker 2:          02:18:26       Well, and you know, you've done this and I've done this, we both been around some of these high rollers before where you realize how much they pick up the phone and talk to other high rollers and how interconnected network is. And there's nothing wrong with that intrinsically, but you could easily see that that networking can be used for nefarious purposes, good purposes or no purposes, but they all have each other on speed dial. Right? That's natural.

Speaker 3:          02:18:49       Yeah. It does seem natural. I mean, podcasts of have, we do have that is a little known fact is you and I to podcasters who learned about each other, the moonlight on you sometimes just moonlight on you as well, sir. Yeah, I mean people in the same business talk to each other and become tight and it affect like, you know, it affects, it affects the way they do business for sure. And it doesn't even necessarily have to be like some that really carefully scripted agreement is almost like a known thing.

Speaker 2:          02:19:22       Exactly right. I think and you know what and and in the, in the era of hacks and all that, isn't that the

Speaker 4:          02:19:28       smarter way to comport yourself, right. Nixon, because he was a taper, knew when he had to have an important discussion with somebody. He wanted to make sure it was safe. They went for a walk, right? And they went for a walk past the White House. They got in the weeds out there and then they had the discussion and then they use the n word or whatever, whatever it might be, but the point clear. That's right, but think about this in 10 years, in 10 years, how is this email hack scandal have going to change a protocol on how all these people do things? Because it is, you watch Colin Powell and everybody watching what's unfolding right now are determining that there are going to be new ways we communicate and it's not going to be like that. Well, there's two different hacks, right? There's the DNC hack and then there's a hillary server hack, right?

Speaker 4:          02:20:16       Aren't they different hacks? Because the DNC, ar, and then there'll be. And from what I heard, I told you, I heard there was a republican national committee hack too. I love the fact that they fired that woman. Oh, did you found something? It's not sure. I'm the guy that said it, said he misspoke. Oh, that came out later. Mr Scott makes me more suspicious than anything. God Damn. Ms Dot Booker's. I just think it's hilarious that, uh, the woman who got outed in the DNC hacks as being this woman who is conspiring to like put down Bernie and help Hillary, like that woman, she had a step down. It was immediately hired by the Clinton campaign. I mean, there's zero transparency. I mean, it's so obvious. Corruption, let's call it what it. And the corruption is both parties and we have no options besides the bulk part. So this is where, you know, like we said on the common sense tool for 11 years now, this is your focal point of the problem.

Speaker 4:          02:21:10       We have a corruption problem. Both parties benefit from it. They have no real interest in addressing it. The only time they're interested in fighting corruption is that they can manage to fight the kind of corruption that helps the other side without impacting the ones that help them. So the Republicans always say that about democratic campaign finance reform, that it goes after Republican funders but not democratic ones. In other words, they're not, they're not holier than thou, they're just trying to figure out another way to game the system, utilizing reform as the tool. I mean, they have to do in some way. They're all complicit in similar sorts of situations, but the, the thing that was so weird, I think I said not transparent, all I met completely transparent. The thing that was weird about how transparent it was is that there wasn't even a gap in time of this woman getting fired and then getting an appearance purposes.

Speaker 4:          02:21:57       Right. It was like instantaneous. It's like we don't care. We're just going to do it. I, yeah, she helped me out. She hooked me up. She's my girl that, that's just like what you said about Hillary Clinton. Uh, um, and the fact that she had said that the FBI director said this about her when he had just said something kind of complete, but she knew that the five percent of people that would realize that didn't count. Same thing. The five percent of people who realize, wait a minute, you just hired that cast. She's not after those pieces. There's another day and more news stories and a plane goes down in Singapore or something, and then there's another news story and some fucking nuclear tests in North Korea and everybody's gone. It's gone. Three weeks later it's gone. There's just so much going on that you can't really maintain any story like that in the news.

Speaker 4:          02:22:39       That's why the Glenn Greenwald, Edward Snowden, the way that they approach that was structured the way it was to come out in chunks because they had said if you release it all at once, it'd be this huge story, but then it's done. If you. If you understand how the news cycle works the way you just mentioned, you want to release a nice chunk and then wait until the headlines die down again and we start moving and then release another chunk and that's the way these wiki leaks is doing that right now with these hacks they have. They're releasing it in chunks because as soon as the news cycle dies down, they want to take advantage of the next one. The wiki leaks thing is one of the most bizarre scenarios where you have this guy that if you asked the United States or just the United States, like what percentage of people support with Julian assange dead?

Speaker 4:          02:23:20       What surprised what percentage of the people support letting people understand what is really going on behind the scenes be pretty overwhelming. I would guarantee you be in the high seventies. Some people are blindly patriotic and they would just want their government to just have carte blanche. There's a few of those, but I think most people would support the. Yeah, I want to know what the fuck's going on now. This guy is trapped in an embassy in London. You can't go anywhere. Ecuadorian embassy or something like that. Right? Is it Ecuador? But he's trapped in this embassy can't leave and been in this house for your potential rape charge. Right? It's not even a rape charge. Supplies, sex. It's hanging over your head. I know. And and, and he can't leave to go answer the charges because they'll grab them. Will, they'll, they'll grab him on completely unrelated purposes or unrelated charges.

Speaker 4:          02:24:11       It has nothing to do with that. They just want to hold him there. I mean, you really think that they'd be chasing him for this long because he had sex without a condom. All spooning. No, we all know that. What is it? Swedish court to rule on? Julian assan facing extradition of Sweden over sexual assault charges. The wiki leaks foundation has been confirmed to a confined to the Ecuadorian embassy in London for more than four years. Huh? The Ecuadorians to to hold onto it. That so crazy. He's been in this house for four years, but here's what they have to do. If they want to keep playing the straight and narrow, they have to get ahold of some some leak documents from the other side because otherwise it's like. It's like if you only get the leaked documents from one side, that does impact the election and that calls into question the motives of the leaker. Right? If you're saying I release information right then, then you can be above the fray. If you say like a lot of journalists understand how to do what you omit and don't release has as much value as what you do. Right? So if the only leaks you're getting are from the Democrats and the Republicans aren't being leaked, then that's influencing the election because you know as well as I do, the other side has crap that that is just as shocking and upsetting and corrupt as the Democrats. So let's see that too.

Speaker 2:          02:25:24       Yeah, let, let's see the two and let's see what trump does when he finds out that, but all talking shit about him. You know, I am ashamed to say that there's a part of me that says, yeah, let's see that I don't want to be that way, but I read somebody online said the other day that there's people who are going to vote for him just for the entertainment value because they don't want to be bored for the next four years. And I thought to myself, that's when the country's really jumped the shark when we're voting for candidates, but I don't care what they'll do. They're both bad. I just want the most entertaining. A lot of people feel that it doesn't matter. They're also thinking that what you look at as a president is really just a figurehead and the military industrial job reading that book right now, American coup.

Speaker 2:          02:26:03       So mate, look, if you look at what Obama promised and you look at what he actually did, very different things. Why people forget the George W dot Bush actually ran on a more humble foreign policy. Do you remember that? He was going to have people. He said, people Americans want a more humble foreign policy. Could there be any, any dichotomy? Worse than a more humble for polly and people will say, well, nine slash 11 happened. Yes, so we attacked Iraq, didn't make any sense, and everybody was like, look, we're fucking kicking someone's ass all right enough to shut up and wave that flag. I will tell you this. Anybody who tells me that they support the troops again but are willing to send them willy nilly anywhere at anytime. To me, supporting the troops means you value their lives and their families and the fact that many of these guys and women who have had to go back and back and back and their lives have been on hold and all and they suffer.

Speaker 2:          02:26:58       I mean, how many stories have we read about what these people deal with everyday? Go to the va and so let's say you want to support the troops, fixed the VA, right? Do the things that matter to the troops and then don't send them into harm's way unless it really, really matters. That's supporting the troops. To me, you have the problem is we don't know what is going on when we hear that the troops need to invade some certain area. We don't know if it's legit or not. Legit. We don't know who the people are that are making the decisions. Ultimately classify it and the classified. And we also don't think there's, there's, there's gotta be some Intel that they're not sharing that might sway our opinion one way or the other. They think that seemed like we were talking about the, um, the Gulf of Tonkin resolution, the last commonsense show with the Gulf of Tonkin resolution.

Speaker 2:          02:27:45       There were parts of it very important parts of it that were not released until 2005, 2005 if it, if you found out within a month that the Gulf of Tonkin, which for those who don't know, this is sort of the, the excuse for why we were able to ramp up the Vietnam war, which killed a ton of people. Right. If you had known within a month in real time, basically that didn't happen the way that they said it happened. That's time enough to impact the decision making. They classified it so that by the time it comes out, everyone's dead and it's in a history book, you have no ability to impact the decision making. That's where classification kills us

Speaker 4:          02:28:22       because if you, the electrode say to heck with this, we've got to go out in the streets or we have to have a protest online. You can't do that if you don't know what's going on. And that was one of the more ironic things about Kennedy's assassination was that they lock the files up for what? When, when did the full files on the Kennedy assassination or allowed to be released, but they essentially made it so that no one could investigate it for far longer than anyone's going to be alive. Like I think it was like 2010. Then it prompts suspicion right there whether or not it's desert. Why would they do that? I did. Well, I did come up with reasons because I felt the same way and I had to figure out a cause. Right? What would explain it? That was rational. And here's what I came up with and I'm hardly the only person who realized this.

Speaker 4:          02:29:04       You remember Oswald had ties to Cuba and he defected to the Soviet Union and then come home. Okay. So if your average joe or Jane and you don't know much about what's going on, but you find out a Cuban defector, Cuban supporting Soviet Union defect, you're killed the president. And that maybe that might. I mean, do you see how that, you know, if you were reading the guns of August on how World War One started and you thought it wouldn't have taken, you know, that that was an assassination to write in an open top vehicle by somebody and Serbians were behind that in the way that the people whose archduke was killed. So, so I mean, if Americans thought that the Soviet Union killed their young president, that they all loved with his wife right there and the two little children, what would the, and you know, this is not even a year after the Cuban missile crisis, how much might that have impacted the president's ability to keep us out of a war or not?

Speaker 4:          02:29:58       I mean, I can see if somebody said that you might have a very good reason for hiding the fact that Oswald had really close ties. I don't know. I was trying to find out a rationale that made sense to me and that would be a rationale that made sense to me. I don't think you have to classify it for a lifetime, which they basically did. What does the year next year, October 26th, 2017 shit when it comes out. Redactions will be all over the place. Oh yeah. I'm sure you'll have if and, but or yeah, I'm sure. But uh, I mean they have leaked some stuff or release some stuff through the Freedom Information Act that people would consider incredibly offensive and they found out about it like 1962 northwoods operation northwoods where they designed a tax on Guantanamo Bay. They were going to arm Cuban friendlies and attack one tottenham obey, potentially killing.

Speaker 4:          02:30:49       Who knows how many soldiers they're going to blow up a drone jetliner and blame it on the Cubans all if you look at the stuff that the CIA was doing. And I think it's stupid to think that they don't do the similar things now. It's, it's crazy stuff. Kills a stuff that is so. And here's the thing, stuff that is so opposed to the 19 fifties highschool mythology of America that it's hard to reconcile the two. And those people will say, listen, it's the real world. Welcome to, you know, we were trying to survive. We had hydrogen

Speaker 2:          02:31:20       bombs aimed at us. I mean all that stuff is true, but how do you reconcile it? I mean,

Speaker 3:          02:31:25       yeah, that was, that was a giant issue with Kennedy, you know, and, and secrecy itself was a giant issue with Kennedy, which is so ironic that they sealed his death up for 25 years. You remember that very famous speech that he had were about secrecy and government. Oh yeah. About transparency being important.

Speaker 2:          02:31:42       Or my favorite line from Kennedy was always the one where he says, those who make peaceful change, uh, impossible. Make violent change. Inevitable. I mean, those are the kinds of things where you wonder about us now will you say, listen, the ability to have our system evolve in ways that make it better are going to prevent really bad things from happening in the future. If you can't, if we can't get it together now, just follow the current trends outward. If nothing changes, what is the 20, 20 election gonna look like? Are you a Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone type of guy? I am now. I changed my mind on that. I used to. Got You. Huh? Who got, you know, here's the thing, and this is what always upsets me about the conspiracy theorists. I love them, but I wish they wouldn't leave stuff out of there, out of their stories that disprove, that looked bad.

Speaker 2:          02:32:28       In other words, not everybody does that. I don't blame them. Everybody likes to say, okay, I'll show you the things that, that backup my theory. But with Oswald, there were a couple of books that came out. Uh, my friend Vince Bull Yossi had one. Uh, Gerald Posner had another where they included stuff that was not in all the conspiracy books that I read and I've read a lot. And you say, okay, one, why the hell didn't you put that in there? Now I'm mad at you and I don't trust you as much stuff can be the fact that Oswald took a shot at a US general before he took a shot at Kennedy. Right? If you figured out that he needed to do that, oh God, I want to say who was the general two to 10 years ago, I would have remembered his name go. We have to look up Lee Harvey Oswald. He took a shot at the general and missed and with the same rifle I believe, and it was posner and bull Yossi that both pointed that out and when you turn around and go, okay, if the guy was really taking a shot at the US general, now that changes my overall view of the Guy Oswald's

Speaker 3:          02:33:23       earlier attempt to assassinate General Walker

Speaker 2:          02:33:27       interest. And so when you hear that again, now that might not be anything, but why'd you leave some of that out of my conspiracy book?

Speaker 3:          02:33:34       That's important, you know, as an another thing about the Oswald thing that always bugged me was that they said that the scope wasn't cited in properly. The man lake, no rifle. How could he, how could he get off that shot when the scope wasn't even cited improperly? Mike, how do you know it's not cited improperly? You know, it's not cited improperly because right after they found it, they shot with it. How long did it take for they shot with it. Do you know anything about scopes? Let me tell you something about scopes. You fucking drop your rifle in the ground and that thing gets off the caliber. It's uncalibrated. It happens easy. You could bang your rifle against a log or a rock or something like that. I doubt he was putting it down and carefully after shooting the president. Not only that, who the fuck was handling it. There was so much

Speaker 4:          02:34:17       shenanigans involved in handling the right way, so that argument I reject because when they said that the gun wasn't cited in properly, I'm like, that does. That doesn't make any sense. You have no idea what, how it was cited in when he pulled the trigger. You don't know. It's so easy to throw off. Kennedy had pissed off a lot of a lot of people and so when you talk about a conspiracy and having motive, there were a lot of people that had motive. I always hate it when they know the Oliver Stone movie drove me crazy because in my opinion, the movie he did on JFK, he took every conspiracy theory out there and throw them all in which discredited all of them to me want to go with fake general who didn't really exist. I them all the information. I can't do that. Get me started on him.

Speaker 4:          02:34:59       No good. True. Star John F Kennedy it. Yeah. They do that in these movies that are supposed to be about real history. Oh, he did it with the doors and then when he was, he was called. He was called on it. His answer was this wasn't a movie about the doors. In reality was a movie about what I thought about the doors when I was fighting in Vietnam, listening to their music. Got The dude say that at the beginning of the film, put up this. This is a fictionalized version of what I thought when I was in such a the great to. Yeah, they alexander the great film to. You're just going to add this movie. The snowden movie. He's got coming out this week. Oliver Stone didn't get funding for Stoughton in the US in Germany. He found both financial support and filming locations. First political thriller, but it's released as low key as a US trying to keep it under wraps is the US like visit the US operates as one giant.

Speaker 4:          02:35:48       That's exactly right. Yeah. The press is keeping it down because they don't want everybody to talk about the snowden. If, if they thought it would make $150, million dollars, the studios, we'd be pushing it left right and center right now. They'd love a hit of any kind regardless of what it said. What were we just talking about before you brought that up? A JFK. I'm oliver stone stuff into those movies. Okay. So No, the, those uh, I wanted to know what other things led you to believe that a Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone? Well, I mean originally, you know, when you follow the story, so you see it's not just the fact that, that it probably happened a certain way. It's when you follow the conspiracy talking, you realize, you know what they're bringing to the equation. How much do I believe the David for the Cuban idea?

Speaker 4:          02:36:33       How much do I believe? And after going through it, you know, if you go read like book Yossi his book, he was the guy who wrote helter skelter. He prosecuted Manson, he was a guy I liked a lot and, and he, he wrote a book where he did it like a prosecutor. So here's how I would have prosecuted Oswald. And when he lines it up the way he does, you sit there and go, okay, this is not an I know bull. You'll see he was a, he was a guy that would have loved to have written that it wasn't. He would have loved to have said Kennedy was assassinated by a conspiracy, but he did. Then he ran down the list and you sit there and go, okay, if I was at the trial and I was on the jury and they said, what was the preponderance of evidence? And did the prosecutor, you know, prove his case. I would have had to have set after reading [inaudible] book that had less. I really had a vested

Speaker 3:          02:37:16       interest in believing the conspiracy theory that he had done a damn good job of making his case. Here's my problem with it and this is one that for whatever reason I don't see brought up very often. I don't think they have to be mutually exclusive. I don't think Oswald was innocent. I think Oswald very well as the might have shot at the at the present, but I think it's highly likely they set up more than one shooter. I think there's a possibility that gunfire echoing from that building could make people think that it was coming from the grassy knoll, but there's so many people that said that gunfire was coming from the grassy knoll that you have to wonder and you look at the shots that hit Kennedy, like the one in his neck. That's one of the. One of the more interesting books that I read about it was a case case closed.

Speaker 3:          02:38:04       I'm best evidence by David. Lifted. Lifted was the one that. Didn't he say that they put something in the autopsy and Kennedy's head like that. That to me, by the way, was it or something, and that was the part that blew me away because when we were kids, uh, they didn't have the Kennedy autopsy, you. And then to eventually release those. That was shocking and put it in the book. Yeah. Yeah. Well, they also changed between Bethesda, Maryland, and Dallas in that flight from Dallas to Bethesda, they changed the risk, like what the impact was. They were calling it a bullet hole in his neck in Dallas. And then when it got to Bethesda, they refer to it as a tracheotomy whole. Here's my problem. He was hit from the front end, from the back, like it's entirely possible that Oswald also was involved and that there was a bunch of people involved.

Speaker 3:          02:38:51       It's entirely possible that if you're going to assassinate the president, if you're going to have a conspiracy to assassinate the president, you're gonna use a bunch of people. Why wouldn't they use someone like Oswald? Why wouldn't they use some crazy fuck who emigrates to Russia and comes back with a Russian wife and he's involved in communist propaganda and all sorts of other crazy, unsavory, shitty shoots. It generals. Yeah, that's it. Exactly. A guy you would use and he might've been involved to. It might have been, and I don't know, somehow or another it always the. The debate is always a mutually exclusive thing. Either Oswald acted alone or the CIA killed Kennedy or the NSA. Who the fuck with the Cubans, the mob and they blamed it on Oswald. Well, it's. It could totally be. He was a part of it all and that there was more than one shooter. That seems to me to be the most likely thing.

Speaker 3:          02:39:41       It's certainly possible when Jack Ruby runs up to him and shoots him in front of all those cops, those cops were walking them out there and there was assassination. They're holding onto his arm. We've got them. We've got the guy who shot the president out in the open, in front of everybody. Who was that? A guy with a gun. Oh No, mine. The guy who. Who was my mentor when I first started in news was a local guy here that everybody knows new guide him, John Babcock and babcock was a Texas guy originally and he was in the motorcade in the very last car because they had press writing and the so far, but

Speaker 2:          02:40:14       he was in the motorcade, so they went. He was at Parkland when, when it was announced at Kennedy was dead and then he was. He told me the story. He had good stories. He had good Manson stories too. He was in the room with ruby before they brought Oswald out before ruby killed him and he said, what are you doing here today? Jack and Jack, and he had a conversation beforehand. I don't recall what John Thought in terms of conspiracy or not conspiracy, but I remember that that was like a seminal moment in his career because he was broadcasting live. He was on the radio while it was all going on and he was there at the scene. He also had the most awesome Manson stuff because I'm. The station I worked at KBC was big in the Manson investigation. They're the ones that actually found the bloody clothes a year later on the hillside while they were filming a recreation and that's how the bloody clothes got found and he would go and speak to Manson all the time through the Manson was not convicted yet, so he's on trial and awaiting trial and he had Manson became friends and up on his wall he had a photo of Charles Manson within Pencil, a note and I still remember what it said.

Speaker 2:          02:41:19       It said to the trial, come early, stay late. It will be quite a show. And he said, look at that, writing that Manson data. And I looked at it and it was weird. You could see that the pencil was broken, like he would snap the point off the pencil, every couple of words. He said, do you know why the point of the pencil snapped? I go, no. He goes, [inaudible]. The guy had no education, but he was pretty smart and he used to get so frustrated at his inability to express himself that break the pencil. So then once he was convicted and remember he was sent to death row. John said, I stopped paying attention to him because you know, he's on death row. I'm moving on. So manson started sending him messages saying, why don't you come and visit me anymore? And so finally John went and he said, Manson said, so why don't you come and visit me anymore?

Speaker 2:          02:42:03       And John said, well, you know, Charlie, you know, you're going to the. And Manson says, so you don't think I can, you know, you don't think I'm. And he goes, no. So he said, come back in a week. And so John says, so I come back in a week and all Manson did was slide under the table, like a cocktail Napkin type thing and on it was drawn the layout of John's house. And he said, I went home and I bought three shotguns and I put them in loaded in various parts of my house. He says, they're still there to this day, but basically wouldn't that scare the hell out of you that have somebody draw? In other words, he'd sent somebody to John's house to go look around and then tell them what it looked like and then sending the cocktail that African. He had so many good stories that old.

Speaker 2:          02:42:43       He was old fashioned news guy, but he was in the Kennedy thing and we used to talk about that all the time and now I wish I could remember 50 year old brain bus speed. What John had told me about his thinking on it. I guess. I guess my attitude is I'm always disinclined to believe conspiracy theories and less. The preponderance of evidence convinces me otherwise. What we talked about when I read it, we talked about the Gulf of Tonkin. That's an absolute false flag that was perpetrated on the American public resulting in us going to war, ramping up the war, killing. Who knows how many people,

Speaker 4:          02:43:12       but everybody that the people in government don't have to sweat the Kent. Okay. All the people around Kennedy were Kennedy's people, and so whether you're talking about the defense secretary or a lot of the whiz kids, they were called when Kennedy brought in these new people from private industry. They were his people and they stayed in the Johnson administration. Those people would have had to. I mean, if they had thought that their boss who brought them into government had been killed by Johnson or by the government. I mean, it just, it's, it's hard to believe what. How do they know? How would you know? Okay. If you're all in an office and you're working with president gets shot, you think you're going to get more information than the average person on the street. You're probably not. You're probably going to have to read the news reports just like everybody else.

Speaker 4:          02:43:55       You're going to see Oswald paraded out there. You're gonna. See Jack Ruby, shoot them. You're going to have people in your organization tell you that they shot the guy who shot the president and you're going to believe it until you see this approved or film until you watching the Geraldo Rivera show. And Dick Gregory brings on the Zapruder film. What was it like 10 years later? And I remember this wasn't like 10 years later. Well, what year did it wasn't like they assassinated him in 63 and I don't think he made it on the Dick Gregory show until the 19 seventies. No, it was late seventies to I think, or the Geraldo Rivera show. Was it then? Here's the question either if it wasn't the government. So look at all the different people that Oliver Stone could throw into a film, right? Which the Mafia or whatever. If it's not the government, then the government has no reason at all to cover it up.

Speaker 4:          02:44:41       Right, okay. If the mafia does it, Robert F Kennedy is going after the mafia all the time anyway. It just gives him one more reason to go. So the only way this becomes a conspiracy that stays secret and, and involves the government not investigating it, is if the government is in on it. So that's the only conspiracy theory that makes sense on why the government didn't pursue the conspiracy theory. Okay. So if the government is in on it, well, how many people have to be in on it? See, here's the thing. If, if the narrative that they can find, they didn't compartmentalize, that was standard. I do everything, everything is compartmentalized and there's a need to know basis and you know, unless you're some dude in a movie who wants to get to the bottom of it and he was sneaking into the building in the middle of the Warren Commission report and the magic bullet, all that stuff is, is part of the cover up if you buy that theory while the Warren Commission report in and of itself is what lyft and uses and a reason to go in and start investigating the Kennedy assassination.

Speaker 4:          02:45:36       Well, as I told it was a good reason to have covered it up. If you believe that the American people would draw a natural conclusion that a Soviet agent killed our president and remember, you know, Kennedy had been trying to assassinate Castro to. So there were reasons for a Cuban group of people to take. I mean, there's a lot of enemies. There's a lot of enemies also in government. He was trying to get rid of the CIA. He was trying to do a lot of stuff that people didn't like, the speech that he gave about transparency, about secret secrets and secret societies being a damaging part of our culture. Does that mean that was all. That's all not good if you want to stay alive. Well, and I want to make it clear when it comes to these kinds of theories, I try to have an open mind and, and, and, you know, try to look at every angle and I'm not saying that these things are not possible.

Speaker 4:          02:46:23       You had asked me if I had a view and I used to have one view and now I have another view. Uh, if evidence came out tomorrow that said that made it look like it was a conspiracy or I would be perfectly happy to switch again. I mean, I try, I try to, to be flexible on these things. I don't have a vested interest. So when you say those things, I kind of go, okay, yeah, I can see that. It's not what I believe lately, but I can see that. Yeah. I don't really believe anything when it comes to that. It becomes the Kennedy assassination, other than some fuckery was a foot well and the story when the conspiracy theorists who write these books and it's an industry as you well know, I get angry when they don't include things that might disprove what they say, you want me to believe you?

Speaker 4:          02:47:03       I want. I want you to lay it all right, and so I became suspicious. Once those books started coming forward saying, well, look what they left out here and look what they left out here. And you go, okay, well now you never told me that. You know, there's some tightly grooved paths when it comes to discussing that scarcity. That's why I've always found it so weird that no one mentions or very rarely is it mentioned that Oswald might've been a part of it. The idea that he got off those three shots because they determined that it was three shots based on people's reporting and you know, if you, if you believe that he got off those three shots in a shorter amount of time and then you see Jesse Ventura trying to recreate it and say it's impossible. No one dropped all. Well, someone can do that.

Speaker 4:          02:47:41       That's not true. Like there, there's people that are capable of getting off three shots in six seconds or whatever it was. And, and if I recall Oswald was a marksman. Look, it's him. He probably was okay with a rifle. But if you're leaning, here's the reality, you're leaning on a window sill and you've got a scope with the bolt action. Ancient rifleman. I mean if you really wanted to kill the president, a mail order man, liquor carcanos rifle is not what you would achieve that shooting that far of a shot? No, I mean, what, how many yards was it? You know, and plus after the first one you just spray Kinda, you just pull the trigger a couple times. But if someone else was involved, that's where it gets even weirder. Like he shooting down someone shooting from the front. That seems like what they would do if they were trying to kill somebody.

Speaker 4:          02:48:28       If it's a conspiracy theory triangulation, although let's be honest, that becomes a lot harder to hide later. Right? So if you're worried about exposure, because exposure would would show the tentacles and well then you want to make it as cut and dried and simple as you can. You start triangulating on a president that you know you don't know as you well know what those bullets are going to do, right? I think you open yourself up to massive problems. If those bullets go. I mean if in other words, if something had gone another way and it would have been impossible to deny that there was another shooter, how does that change the whole investigation but actually did happen. That was part of the investigation itself leading to the magic bullet

Speaker 3:          02:49:08       theory. The magic bullet theory was was the well was created because a guy was walking under the underpass and the Kerbstone got hit by a bullet. He was hitting her head with a ricochet. So because he was hit with a ricochet, they found the spot with a bullet. It hit and they had accounted for one bullet. So then they had the head shot that killed Kennedy, and then they had this neck thing and then they had this other bullet. And then they started like trying to figure out, well how many bullets are involved here and how does colony connolly rather have a bullet lodged in his, in his leg, like how does this happen? Or how did he get shot? And a bullet that shattered his bone and went through his leg also went through Kennedy. Is that what we're saying? Like what are we saying? So they had to come up with that one bullet, doing all that damage specifically because somebody got hit with some spray. That's mean that that did happen. That was okay.

Speaker 2:          02:50:00       Part of the investigation, there's a part c and this is the part where it's kind of hard if, if, if you want there to be anything cut and dried. If you're the Warren Commission report and you're doing this not that long after Kennedy's assassination, I think you have to allow for the idea that there are going to be unknowables right? And especially ballistics, ballistics or crazy write bullets, tumble bullets and you know, you fire 900 bullets. It's something, most of them are going to be deformed, but some of them might not be, but they're never going to look like that. Pristine bullet is bullshit.

Speaker 3:          02:50:32       That's the most bullshit aspect of the entire investigations. That's silly bullet. What does that a t shirt, Kennedy assassination or how it would have had to travel through

Speaker 2:          02:50:42       body to surprise me. Bullets can do that. Can hit bones and you'd ricochet and you tumble

Speaker 3:          02:50:48       and this is not totally accurate to. This gets exaggerated like the entry point and the exit point, but the point is when bullets hit bone, they bend and they changed shape. When bullets don't hit bone, when you shoot bullets into ballistic gel or when you shoot them into water especially, they don't form that bullet. Looked like a bullet that was shot through something soft. Look at it there so it doesn't look like what a bullet looks like when it hits bone and that that hit bone. It shattered connolly's wrist, that same bullet and they apparently just found it on his Gurney in the hospital and we're supposed to think that that's a bullet that went through Kennedy and connally and it's. I've never talked to a single actual ballistics expert or firearms enthusiasts that believes that.

Speaker 2:          02:51:38       No. See, this is where she had I known I was coming here. I would have brought both those books will be. Could've looked up how the POC and posing or explain the magic bullet because they the path, it

Speaker 3:          02:51:47       can be explained. I think bullets hit things that people have had bullets ricochet around inside someone's skull and come out there. I, when you shoot them in the face of weird things happen with bullets when they hit bones and they ricochet and they move around, so that's the path of the bullet. Seems crazy but possible.

Speaker 1:          02:52:06       What's weird is that they think that is the bullet. That doesn't make any sense at all. If they just said, that's a bullet that we found and maybe you know, he had another one. I mean maybe something hit something else. Maybe, I don't know, but saying that that went really points to the conspiracy. Yes, it does. To me, it points to people being full of Shit. The fact that they conveniently founded on the Gurney way. Okay. So the government, you say, okay, okay. I guess what I'm saying is outcomes razor. You're not going to have to convince me of that. I'm also that the Warren Commission report might've had all sorts of domestic and foreign policy reasons for doing what it did and just imagine if you're the CIA in 1962 and you, uh, you're getting together with all your cronies and you've been responsible for Jack and people all over the world and you got this guy and he's going to disband your entire organization, you know, and then you're talking to some other people that are upset at them because of the Bay of pigs and he talking about some other people that are upset about them because of this and have that and all the other things that he's trying to do that people don't agree with.

Speaker 1:          02:53:05       And they go, look, there's a simple solution to this. And then you bring in that Lee Harvey Oswald character and you get that ball rolling. You setup a bunch of different people that are really good at rifles. It's, I think it's totally possible. It's one of the most. Wait, wait, wait, conspiracy. It's totally possible branch. You don't bank on it. I mean it's also possible. Here's one thing that always bugged me about the router film. When you watch his head, his head does go back into the left. But the spray from the bullet in my eyes seems like it's going forward. Like he was hit from behind an exit wound. Yeah. Well it seems like a little bit of it. But then sometimes when you hit someone like you could hit things and just the impact of the bullet causes a reverberation. And also if you watch, there's a lot of executions online.

Speaker 1:          02:53:55       And I'm ashamed to say I've seen some, all of them all. If there's a new one tomorrow, uh, no. But. But the one thing you notice is that there are probabilities. But remember, I mean the reason Kennedy's arms went up like this when he was shot, it was because it hit a kind of a nerve cell. In other words, things happen when you start striking nerves and, or unpredictable or it could have hit him in the neck. What did hit him in the neck or behind the shoulder. But, but that caused the arms to Jasper. Watch this real quick. Here's the seat. When you see it, it, it, it's like an exit wound to me. It kind of sprays for he his bow, his head goes, but nowhere to the left. But that could easily have been because of the, you know, just the nerve reaction like that. So that's what I'm saying is that it's, although it does go back into the left leg, it, I know, but that's predictable. There's, there's, um, there's executions of a Chinese nationalists killing Chinese communist and you watch them and they'll do it over and over and over again. And most of the time things go the way you think they should. And sometimes they don't know. Bodies are weird. There's a delay when it goes back into the left, there's a delay that almost

Speaker 4:          02:55:04       seems to indicate that maybe it was, um, a nerve reaction. We'll see that the arm is going up because the bullet goes, but watch the bullet hits, can't believe or watched it. So again, the bullet hits and then there's this back into the left. That could be from the impact of the gun to it. Remember the car is also moving, which is making you, you know, it's, it's, it's hard to tell. And then here's another thing to take into consideration. It's entirely possible that he was hit with two bullets in the head at the same time. That is a possibility. I'm not going to deny it. And I'm also going to say the reason that it would be interesting to know the answer. I mean, if somebody could come down from the extra terrestrials to tell, you know, this is what really is, that it would tell you a lot about subsequent history, right?

Speaker 4:          02:55:46       Um, in that sense, the problem with it though is if you buy into the conspiracy theory as it's normally told, then that basically takes you down this road that, okay, there was a coo, the president was killed by the government, and then that all subsequent history from that point on then takes a, you know, like, you know, they say with time travel, you change something and you go off on a totally different course. All history goes on a totally different course if that's what really happened. In other words, everything must be looked through a different lens. If I was to believe as I used to, that that was done by the government, then my whole common sense show would be totally different. But it doesn't mean don't. You have to look at everything from a different lens when you find something like operation northwoods, when you find the northwoods documents, you see that it's signed by the Joint Chiefs of staff that this was a real plan.

Speaker 4:          02:56:32       They were thinking about implementing and Kennedy put the boycott on it. Well, what they did, some of this, I mean operation northwoods is not that far from things they did in other places. Um, you know, and wasn't Cheney, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but we're trying to do something about that with Iran. Wasn't there a similar thing that was on the table for a false flag to try to get us into Iran before the end of the Bush administration? Was there something that was being reported? Maybe that was on infowars.com. I don't remember that. Can you find that? See if you can find that. But false flag. I ran a Rumsfeld or Cheney, I don't remember who it was. The problem that all those people have is if they think. I always try to give people the benefit of the doubt and say, if you came to me with secret information and says blah, blah, blah, the country needs to do this now and you say to yourself, but I could never get the American people to go along with that.

Speaker 4:          02:57:22       So if they knew what I knew they would, but they won't. So because of that, I'm going, you know, see, you start to try to figure out, instead of just automatically going to conspiracy, right? You Go, okay, could there be a logical reason that I would accept and understand that would explain the same sequence of events? But I always try to do that. Now. I say that as somebody who clearly knows the CIA's record, I mean that's been one of my interests forever. The stuff that they do, I can't think of any natural limitations on. I can't think of anything with the CIA would have said no, I wouldn't do that if the president wanted us to. I don't think many people know this, but you know, in the Nixon administration there was talk about killing Jack Anderson, the investigative reporter, and it was g dot Gordon Liddy who had offered to run him down with a car.

Speaker 4:          02:58:10       So when you talk about that and there are people around the president who are willing to consider the option will then I have to say, you know, Dan, you have to open up your mind to the possibility that these things can happen. And as I said, my opinion for years was that it did. So I'm so, I'm not not open to the idea to propose this, to provoke war. Cheney considered proposal to dress up navy seals as Iranians and shooted them. It's a real source of this. Got To be careful. What is it after he knows how to Seymour Hersh, he's, you know, Seymour's getting a Pulitzer prize winning journalist for the New York, New York Seymour. Seymour Hersh is the one who broke things like, I think he broke me. Eli massacre and things like that. As I said earlier though, Cheney is really a nefarious character in terms of, you know, if you weigh him next to the 19 fifties, the, the idea of fair play and the American way.

Speaker 4:          02:59:04       He didn't believe any of that stuff. It's a doggy dog world and whatever you and I considered an American values is marketing and you reacted to. I mean it's all about, you know, it's, it's real politic as they can. Right? It's such a weird character because he's almost biblical. Like when he had that heart implant and his body wasn't giving off a pulse anymore and the heart was just, this artificial heart was just circling the blood, like he literally was alive without a pulse. How do you listen to the Bible anymore? The WHO listens to him. I mean Fox News people. Ugh. What is weird? Why? While he wants to do it, like why wouldn't you want to fade back? He still wants to influence the process. Are you talking about the guy with the Rolodex? Right. He must clearly enjoy it. Shots and people in his Rolodex.

Speaker 4:          02:59:49       I bet bird seed wasn't incidentally shuttered. Shot face. I used to do a joke about it. That's how you know you were gangster. You shoot your friend in the face and your friend apologizes. That's right. That guy got on TV. He's like, I looked like a bird. So sorry. I was drunk. He was totally sober. That's right. Listen, Dan, we just did three fucking hours. We did. I thought we were just getting started. We just did three hours was every time we do you know what you're going to hear afterwards, right? We didn't talk about any history unless the JF Kennedy assassination. Sounds like it's a history. That's certainly true. We talked about a lot of good shit. Now, the three hours of the.

Speaker 3:          03:00:24       Anytime you want to do it again, man, we'll do another three. Thank you buddy. You're always so good to appreciate your brother. Your.
