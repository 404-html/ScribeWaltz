Speaker 1:          00:00:03       Oh my goodness. Ladies and gentlemen, here we go again. Here we go again. This episode of the Joe Rogan experience. I just did some UFC stuff today, so I almost said the ultimate insider, the Arctic Joe Rogan. And trying to switch gears. I switched gears from Sports Guy Persona. Uh, we uh, were sponsored by Ting. Ting is a, a mobile company. If you go to Rogan.ting.com, you can see all the information and you could also save 25 bucks off of any of their phones or, or the service I believe, I believe it's applicable to a either or with ting is, is a very ethical cell phone company. And what they're trying to do is they're trying to offer you the same service that a big network like sprint would offer you, but they're trying to make it so that you can cancel anytime you want and there's no hidden fees and they, uh, they, they have it set up so that if you don't, uh, if you don't use a certain amount of minutes, say if like a you're on one plan and you use something that would qualify you for a lesser plan on your next bill that's reflected, they reimburse you for it.

Speaker 1:          00:01:14       They, they, they make it so that you're paying for what you use. And really that is how it should be. I mean, it's a, that's how every company should be the idea of getting locked into contracts. It's fucking gross. You don't have to get locked in the contracts and you don't have to suffer with shit phones either. They have the top of the line, android phones, including the Samsung Galaxy s three, which I have, which is just a stunning phone. And the Samsung Galaxy note, Opi hasn't. You have the s, the s three, I sure do. It's a

Speaker 2:          00:01:43       combat asphalt whistle. Earlier I was talking to him about that whistle that always got me embarrassed when

Speaker 1:          00:01:50       the services a gray. A lot of people, um, uh, love the sprint service in La. I know Joey raves about, he says it's great. Um, and the, uh, like I said, the phones that the quality of the phones is top notch. I mean they have the best phones in the world now if you want to like, have like a one purpose device. These, especially the galaxy note to the new one. I saw one today. I, I, you know, it's a little vague. I've resisted getting one, but I think I can't resist any longer. I think I have to have one of those fucking things, isn't it? I am a Dork.

Speaker 2:          00:02:25       Okay. The big heads and big hands. I have a big head and normal. I'm not going to. Yeah, a

Speaker 1:          00:02:32       little fit May. Maybe. Maybe that's what I need. Yeah. Anyway, go do a Rogan.ting.com and you can save 25 bucks and it has all the other information. This is a company though. We've, uh, we've been working with them for a long time, very, very cool people and what they're trying to do is just be involved in an ethical business and we support that. So Rogan.ting.com. We're also sponsored by on it. Of course o n n it if you have never heard of it or anything, you must be new to the podcast because a fucking said everything I could say about on it. Wait, we got, we got the Himalayan sea salt and the salt. Yeah, we just continue to, to have cool shit that we, uh, we're, we're selling people. That's all. We're trying to do it on it. Hey, should they get pepper? Maybe?

Speaker 1:          00:03:20       Yeah. Why would you wouldn't. Have you ever heard of a place that sells salt and pepper? Well, not normally, but see Himalayan sea salt known as a, a more of like a health supplement. Like people put it in their water when they get up in the morning, find some pepper to go with it. It's only good if you're cooking William Pepper. Pepper is only good if you're cooking. I need to find out the benefits of Himalayan Sea salt, but I think it was just like I said with the killer bee. Honey, we have killer bee honey. Why do we have killer bee honey? Because it sounds gangster as fuck, right? It's, it's bad ass to Jackson killer bees and take their fucking honey and that's also bad ass to get some salt that came from the Himalayas. I don't know why. I don't know why it doesn't make any sense.

Speaker 1:          00:04:05       A lot of his fucking stupid but. But it is a fact that Himalayan sea salt sounds dope and if you have it over your house, chicks will think you're smarter than you really are. You know, if a girl comes over at some guy's house and he's got some Himalayan sea salt laying around, she might go, well maybe he knows things. You know, just maybe it's just not good at communicating. What is your fucking pepper who also have a force, a hemp protein powder. It's the finest quality hemp protein powder along with Monica and raw cocoa when it's just fucking fantastic shit and it's super delicious and it's also a very low in sugar. It only has one gram of sugar per serving. It's because it's sweetened with Stevia, which is a natural plant sweetener that's really potent. You only have to use like a tiny amount of it.

Speaker 1:          00:04:49       It's pretty crazy shut, but it's super delicious and nutritious. And of course Alpha brain, which is the cognitive enhancing formula. What Alpha brain is a. it's common at atory supplement. A bunch of different nootropics and nootropics are these vitamins and nutrients for the. For Your Dome Son to file your neuro transmitters to keep you talking. All smoothies, shit like me, a use code name, Rogan save 10 percent off any and all supplements. All right. Freaks. Oh, alright.

Cool. Awesome. So desk while dot t dot v is the website. Um, and uh, uh, my new specials available right now. It's on Joe Rogan.net. It's five bucks. It's drm free. It's just the, the Louis C K model. So I'm go get that and go fuck yourself. Okay. All right, great. Oop. Joey or ladies, you play the music and the podcast has come full circle experience trying to get podcasts all.

Speaker 1:          00:07:09       What happened? He just, he just died off there. Like your, your actual real voice. The podcast has come full circle. You are here. If it was not for Opie and Anthony, I doubt I would have ever thought it would be so fun to do a podcast. What was it about us that made you want to do this? Because you guys are the first radio show that I've ever done. That is a complete hang out. Like almost every show that I had ever done. Even the great ones. Howard Stern, whatever it felt like they have an agenda like the sit down and they'll ask questions and you know, they have and they're going to control it and they're going to move it along certain lines with you guys. It was always just to hang out. You would go there and it was just a real conversation. Well, uh, it's, it's just that word lazy.

Speaker 1:          00:07:56       Yeah. But you don't understand that all of a sudden the right way to do it. But then it became our thing, you know, just to chill out and, you know, go for it. You guys doing it that way, inspired me to do this the same way I am. That's so cool. One hundred percent, 100 percent. If it wasn't for doing your show because every other show where someone got, you know, they got interviewed on your show. You just talked. I mean, we could go on a show and you know, we could just all ask anthony about guns and that'd be a fascinating fucking show and we could do it for an hour and a half, hour and a half. You know what I'm saying? That's him getting warmed up as far as that'd be three or four hours, but you know what I mean. I mean it's like, well, the philosophy I've always had about radio is a philosophy about radio.

Speaker 1:          00:08:38       Uh, there's a lot of egos and radio. Yeah. And so they, there's a lot of guys, I don't feel like naming names today, but a lot of guys, they have to be the funniest guy in the, in the room. They have to be the most creative, the most interesting. And we took the tack, like if you come on our show, we're going to fucking sit back and listen to what Joe Rogan has to say because you come in well prepared and you'll do, you blow our mind every time you come in. But when I go home and I'm in among my friends and family, they go, wow, that was a really good show today. I get the credit in the end. So who gives a fuck? Who the funniest guy is in the room or, or the most interesting. But a lot of radio guys never understood that fucking concept.

Speaker 1:          00:09:14       So it goes back to your thought, everything has to be all right for the next 15 minutes we're going to do this and then we're gonna move onto the interview and if you get a laugh, I got to make sure I get a bigger laugh. That's an exhausting way to do it is really dumb too. It's like, why would you not want other people to be funny? Right? How does that make you less funny? Like the idea that your entire body of work that you've done up until now is meaningless. If this other person is funnier for a brief moment. Of course it's so stupid. It's like, why would you be even affected by it at all if someone else is doing well, but the business is filled with those guys. It's so weak. It's comedy is as well. Yeah. And, and they're scared of the unknown as far as radio goes.

Speaker 1:          00:09:58       You know, if something's going well just go with it. But they have that stupid a clock in their head and they're like, well, we only allowed 20 minutes for this guy to be funny or interesting and we got to move on to like news or some horse. Yeah. I think you have to go to said, just throw all that shit away and just keep going. All right. We're going to read the news at noon. You're fucking thing that you have to do 15 minutes and all that. And that bored the hell out of me when I got into radio. I mean they still do it. They still do it. I got in and I was playing music and all that shit. I'm like, this is stupid. If I can't talk and just, you know, have some kind of hang, then I'm going to go and do something else.

Speaker 1:          00:10:33       Yeah. Kevin. And been a really interesting guys. I don't know if you know them at all. The guys, of course. Yeah. Do you guys, have you ever met one of them? Who's the bigger guy that's been. Yeah. I've met Ben at k rock in New York. He's really smart. He could've been nicer, really smart cats and if someone just like let them talk in the morning and just have people on talking and have guests on a talk with them, should be fucking a fantastic radio show, but they have to shove songs. Then they just shove songs in it because that's the new thing on regular radio. You've got to get to music and for whatever reason, I mean, and it's all music we've heard a million times. You're not going to blow my mind with a new song. Right. And you can be in the middle of the coolest fucking conversation.

Speaker 1:          00:11:14       They have to play a song and the PDS are down the hall there. They're watching the clock and they'll hotline, you know, they'll, they'll come march in the studio and they'll, they'll do this point at an imaginary watch like, you know, get back, get back to the format. So whack. Hey, am I going to get strep throat from you? No, no, no. He didn't. He didn't. I was only contagious for the. First of all I'm thinking is I'm going to get strep throat now. I was, how do you get strep throat then you have to kiss somebody or something. Uh, I think it's from eating a lot of pussy. I'm allergic to penicillin, which is like the number one, like get rid of strep things. So that's why I get it so much. You're that guy that's allergic it. I'm the one

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       guy and it's so I have, I think that's why I get it so much. But the only thing I've been doing is eating pussy. What? You sound like you're doing a character. He's like, yeah, if you can, if you didn't. Pithy, like the creepiest guy. Every voice to be talking to Brian has strep throat right now. Your voice is whack. If you took penicillin. I need to know I get a huge rash over my whole intensity. It's pretty bad. Rash. I'm not like, you can survive that, right? Yeah. But I, I can take z packs and that usually works. Love the zoo. Pass time. I love my left. Tonsil is so big that the air is gone from my throat. Like when it tried to sleep, it's like I'm gagging the whole night because I'm like, I can't breathe. Oh, rapid strep throat. Think so it's not fun. Oh, this place is set up up to

Speaker 1:          00:12:41       Kinda intimidating, intimidating. Wait till we put the Werewolf in. What's the world? Will get a wearable. There's a guy named. Pat Mcgee is a special effects guy. He's recreating the American Werewolf, right? You know, uh, American Werewolf in London. They do a full size version of it. And how bad ass is that kind of jealous. We got just a shitty studio in New York that we can't do much with. Well, that's the beautiful thing about not having a boss, you know, to whatever we want. We just set, just done a little of that just a little while. You guys can, you know, you guys have been saddled down by bosses forever if you guys, uh, not really. Never. Now we've never listened to him. Yeah, that's true. That's caused a lot of strife over the years. But the fact that there's even any strife, you know, they should just leave you the fuck alone.

Speaker 1:          00:13:32       They should let you do whatever you want to do and you're going to do it the right way. You're trying to do a good show as much as we complain. I mean, we're allowed to do whatever the fuck we want, but what about. What about this is ideal you have? You don't listen to anybody? No, not no one is on your back. This is the one there. This is the whole operation. Get it. The whole operation. Yeah. Yeah. We do whatever we want. That's cool. Yeah. I mean there's a lot of shit that I'm sure we would've gotten in trouble for it. We had to listen to somebody. What do you think is stupid? What is your number one thing you would have gotten in trouble for? If it was on regular radio? You of the word cunt. Oh, language crap. Yeah. Yeah, but satellite.

Speaker 1:          00:14:10       You can tell a lot of. I'm sure a lot of corporate stuff, but you guys know about corporations drugs. You wouldn't last a couple of sponsors, but did you do any bits that would have gotten you in trouble? We don't really do. Bits are going away. Yeah, we just, I mean I would rather just have conversations with interesting people like it, but then, but every now and then someone will do a bit. That's fucking great. I mean, I'm not opposed to anybody creating anything that's funny just for us to do it. So much to talk about. Hope the world is fucking banana and I do have to say this. You're the king of twitter, the King of twitter ads. You are the king of twitter has to be said. You're the lengths you tweet or just amazing. Oh well get them to me. You know, most of your search that out.

Speaker 1:          00:14:55       Yeah. Well maybe some of it is a things I retweet. Some of it is things Sunday, whatever I could put, but you're filtering it from, you know, you're filtering the shit you're, you're finding and then sending it out to your people, but there's never been a time where you get so much weird shit thrown at you all day and you can throw it right back at everybody. And you were the one that started the whole planet thing. Where earth is this. Yeah. And then it shows this and it just gets bigger and bigger and just blows your mind. Now the thing is everywhere. But you were the first one to tweet that. Oh really? Well, it was just knowing how fucking big shit is. Loved that video. That video is so fascinating. Do you love it though? It doesn't creep you out. Yeah, definitely. Definitely does.

Speaker 1:          00:15:36       We had a neil degrasse Tyson Tyson on the other day, the astrophysicist. Sure. He was talking to us about. Oh my God, he was talking to us about the depth of the universe and it just, the way he does it, first of all, he's so brilliant and passionate and when he describes things, it's just so like there's like a theater to it as well, you know, because he's such a good talker and he's also so fucking smart. So when he's talking about the multiverse and the idea that the universe with hundreds of billions of galaxies, like almost infinite, is really just one of an infinite number of universes and he likes, it just freaks. It can freak you the fuck out and you're one of these guys. You're convinces his life all over the fucking place. Right? I don't see how weak, you know, I think they've done calculations on not just like everything in the world is a collection of Adam's essentially.

Speaker 1:          00:16:28       Right. And I think if you understand what it is that's your, uh, your Dorsal, I think they understand that if the universe is large enough that every collection of atoms in exactly the same collection as it is on earth will exist somewhere else that when you're talking about something that's infinite, like literally everything that exists in the exact same order and the exact objects in the exact place exist in some place, but it has to be some insane light years away. Like 14 trillion, trillion, trillion trillion. There was a into the wormhole with uh, what's, what's his name guys banging his granddaughter, Morgan Freeman, Morgan Freeman. And he's the host of this. And it's just like. So there's another ope. It just, you have to go far enough if that's what infinity means. It's so crazy that not only is there another ope, but there's another jamie in the room, there's another Brian.

Speaker 1:          00:17:28       The room is another me and I wrote like, that is real, but what kind of life you think is out there is that I think we're out exactly how we're living on earth or it or is it earth? Uh, 5,000 years ago, the universe infinite is so crazy that the earth in exactly the order that it appears here might be somewhere else because it's just a combination of Adams and various states and that combination of animes in various states could absolutely mirror in the infinite, but we have to think about what the infinite means, what the with the infinite is. It's impossible for us to conceptualize that freak you out as a kid when you started thinking about the universe and then you were okay with the fact that, wait, maybe it ends and there's a wall. This is how I thought of it. I'm like, okay.

Speaker 1:          00:18:12       The bar says, and there's a wall, but then I started thinking, what the fuck's on the other side of the wall? I remember being a little kid and just stopping and thinking for a second that there's not a roof, there's not a roof to the world. Wow. You know, there's just kind of flying through space and all of a sudden my law, my world went like from my point of view to be in this is my neighborhood, this is where I lived, to what the fuck? Like how come nobody's talking about that? It was, it was really weird to be like a seven or an eight year old, whatever it was when I really started about eight. I think it happens a around a for everyone because that's about the time you realize you're going to die your life. Far too scary day. I remember I learned at eight that you were going to die and my parents were taken off to go to the movies.

Speaker 1:          00:18:59       I just want to suck on. My Mom's was so fucking scared and to them it was just a night out to me. It was like a life changer. I'm like, wait a minute, this fucking thing in day. Yeah. It was a weird, weird night. I cried the first night, I realized that I was going to die someday, like six or something like that. I cried. I was really sad and that was also when I was, I, I'd already given up on religion because I did a year in Catholic school. Are you a Catholic guy originally? Yeah, I did one year in Catholic school. I was like, yeah, nope. I'm telling my parents had run away from home. Was it? I'm not going. Was it all boys school? No, it was separate to separate us in class, but there was girls that it would have other classes. I was, I was brought up Catholic, but I'm not a, I'm not an organized religion guy.

Speaker 1:          00:19:45       The craziest girl I ever dated was, went to an all girls Catholic school. Yeah. What do you believe in then? Um, I don't really believe in anything. I mean, I don't not believe in anything either. That's the problem. Are you an atheist? No, I wouldn't say I'm an atheist. There's something right now we just haven't. I don't know. I'm definitely not throw out the possibility that there's something, I think to throw out the possibility that there's something out there is kind of silly. I think this, a lot of the reaction that people do that is the reaction against organized religion and organized religion. We all know is silly. So your reaction is to say no. There's no god. There's no anything, there's no evidence. I, I respectfully leave open the possibility for almost anything. But do you. You said we all know, we all know what the religion is organized religion.

Speaker 1:          00:20:33       You're listening to this show and you, you feel me on this dog. I'm telling you know, and I know that it's a crock of shit, but that was, that's interesting. I want to go with that for a second. Are you talking to the people out there that go to church every Sunday? They even know? Or are you talking about the people that have given up on, on organized religion? If you're really paying attention, you know, Tore Shit. If you're really paying attention and if you're not paying attention, that's on you, right? You don't have. People just don't want to admit that I don't want it to themselves. It doesn't mean that there's no god is the idea that there's no god, it's crazy, but the real problem was the idea that all those contradictory things, all those ridiculous things that are written down on paper about controlling property and about wearing types of cloth, at the same time, things need to be put to death for like if you really knew what the fuck was in the Bible and you really got a good account of it and excellent translation of all of it together, which is really fucking difficult, right?

Speaker 1:          00:21:31       You would go, this is crazy. People talk, okay, this is not God telling you all this shit. There may be a god and maybe God has a way of communicating to you through good and bad feelings, good and bad reactions to people, and maybe that's what God's message truly is and that's people have sort of learned lessons from these things and written them down. It doesn't discount the idea that there might be some overwhelming force in the universe that creates all of this. The idea that we should discount that entirely. I think it's kind of nuts. I think the problem is that it's been simplified to this nonsense sort of cartoonish, you know, man and a robe and gods and then his son Jesus came down. I think that that's what fucks it up for the real idea because the real idea is not that far fetched.

Speaker 1:          00:22:20       Well how do we update that? Well, yeah, that's a good thing because the Bible was written what, 600 years after the fact. The real problem is pussy. Okay, let me just break it down. The real problem is pussy because what happens is someone has a new way of thinking. Someone has a new way of doing it. Someone comes up with a new Bible and they put it all together and then they start teaching that shit and then they start banging chicks and then everybody gets pissed off and then everybody wants to come in Waco style with guns and you're not going to be able to update it. One of the things about religion is it has to be old as fuck. If it's not oldest, fuck, we're getting there. We're not going to trust you, but there was a time. Catholicism wasn't old as fuck.

Speaker 1:          00:23:02       Yeah. Was there one time it was as new as scientology. When was that? When was it created? Was it created all at once or did it absorb other religions? I don't. I don't know. The history of says I have no idea. It just always was. I wasn't paying attention. What a country religion to grow up as a Catholic was just fucking just torturous and then and then the other religions you gotta blow off as not being real. Well, everyone's full of shit. Crazy. That's the reality is that the absolute hardcore reality is that we're just studying some things that people wrote and the idea that any of that stuff is a message from God and then he's not communicating with you today in some way, shape or form. It's crazy. You know? I think that most of what people wrote about, most likely the origins of it, the real big experiences that we wrote about were either bullshit or would probably psychedelic experiences.

Speaker 1:          00:23:55       I think they were eating a lot of mushrooms back then. The shit grew everywhere and they knew the ones you could eat and the ones you couldn't because it kept you alive. You've talked about that on our show. Yeah. And, and you look at the old, uh, what drawings and the drawings and stuff, and you see the fucking magic mushrooms. All magic mushrooms, first of all, all over Christmas Lore, all over depictions of Christmas is the, to Mascara mushroom. I mean you see little elves with like dancing around these mushrooms. So the thing about that mushroom is apparently it was very variable, like you could get ahold of some event and it doesn't do shit for you and then you can get a hold of some other stuff that gives you the psychedelic experience. And it might be seasonal, it might be geographical, it might vary in genetics.

Speaker 1:          00:24:39       So it's a tricky mushroom, but those are a lot of evidence that points to the root of a lot of these religious things having to do with mushrooms and the use of psychedelic. So why do they write about that one? Because it's first of all, find a deep on, you could find it on the internet somewhere deep, but there have been people that have written things about it, but it's not something that makes people excited. The, uh, the idea of psychedelics being anything other than a distraction and you know, something bad for your life, you know, like when you think about, like someone says, oh, he does psychedelics. What does that mean to me? It was, it was to me, you know, automatically think hunter s Thompson, he's losing his mind, firing his gun at the walls. You know, that that sort of vision pops into mind.

Speaker 1:          00:25:21       Are you heading that way? No, that's crazy. But if you, if you said arguing the hunter s Thomas of our time, I heart, that's ridiculous. You're getting there. And he was a genius. He was a, he was an alcoholic too. I mean at the end it was really, I'm a huge fan and the end of his life is very sad. I was listening to your uh, yeah. It was like almost he couldn't even understand them. Yeah. He was just rambling and told. Yeah, I know you're not a big alcohol guy. No, because I'd listened to the Joe Rogan podcast. Who did you have on one of our. Oh, dom rare. Powerful dot. Yeah. That was a cool plan partner. I know and I found it fascinating that you used to hang out at that pool joint. Which one? The north north of the city. Chelsea. Chelsea bulliers weren't in white plains.

Speaker 1:          00:26:08       Yeah. Executive leaders and wife was a great podcast to a thanks. Yeah, totally. The old stories of the old pool hall. Yeah. That's just one of the last fun places where a man could be a man in this country. You know, there's something about pool halls, like a lot of people like they look down on it or they have a negative connotation with it because a lot of times pool is thought of as like this kind of tough person game or some, you know, you're going to be around like seedy characters and. But I've had some of the best times of my life and pool halls. Are you good? Yeah, I'm pretty good. Real good. Came in second place in the tournament last night. Oh, you're still playing well. Damn. Yeah. I played in Toronto. Still like it. Yeah. Yeah. I just started playing in a tournament again.

Speaker 1:          00:26:48       But yeah, I love playing. I played, I played a lot of money. No, no, no. I mean if I'm with somebody I would gamble like a for the pay for the time or something like that or play for like 20 bucks or something like that. I not really interested in stealing the money, but I'm just interested in, uh, I just liked the game was just like playing the game. I like competing. Why? Why do you like that game? Because it's a control game. The game is all about focusing in exactly on the amount of effort that you have to use with your hand to make a ball roll certain amount of revolutions and there's times where literally you're looking for the position to be, to vary between one and maybe a half a revolution. So you're, you're looking to get that close and you're doing this all striking a ball with another ball.

Speaker 1:          00:27:32       Now when I play, I just want to try to hit that mark. Have you ever seen anybody that's really good? Well, yeah, like really, really good money. SPN Yeah, in real life, but there's like an art. What's her name? Oh, genetically she's very good. She's good to look at. There's there's guys that you watched them play and it's like you're watching an art form. It's like, I think that blows your mind when you see that. I think that's the case with anything. I think if you understand chess, I think that the chest is like that. I think the people that really understand shit. I mean I understand chest, but not enough to like read like the Rook Knight to seven and all that shit. I don't, I don't really know it that way. I just know which pieces go in what way, but I know that peace to people that love games, they'll sit and watch a guy play and they get an uber.

Speaker 1:          00:28:15       Ah. When they see a good move, like, oh fuck yeah, fuck. Just it. Just jacked him with that shit and that you know that that comes from knowing that that form of competition. I, I used to like playing chess, I was pretty good growing up. And then when you realize you have to think 10, 12 fucking moves ahead. It's a lot of work done, a lot of work to think to think about all these different things that could possibly happen and to calculate what's the risk and the reward and the factor in how your opponent plays and what's your. What's your deal with alcohol? What, why don't you like it as much as the other stuff you've talked about? Oh, it's fun. It's just bad for your body. You know, like still. I still drank. I mean I'll help. I'll have a couple of cocktails on occasion, on occasion, but the problem is like get hammered.

Speaker 1:          00:29:02       Then the next day you feel like fucking shit, but if you smoke pot you don't feel bad at all. You know? Alcohol does a lot of great things. It, it, it enables people to laugh when they maybe wouldn't have a lot more fucking high five and a lot more craziness. This could be great. Loosens people up. Yeah. Loosens people up. It's great for comedy clubs, man. Like you could tell like evenings a week, nights at the Improv, like one of the things about the Improv during the week, uh, the shows are great. They're very realistic. Like the crowds do not give you any more than you deserve. If you're, you're, you're killing. They'll laugh really hard. Sure. But you gotta be on point. They're not going to just give it to you. Yeah. They're not drinking. You look around, you'll see like, ah, sodas and shit. You know, I just got a text from Jamie from the Improv by the.

Speaker 1:          00:29:48       Well I flew in. You mean the laugh factory? Oh, he's left factor by the. I'm not the Improv. This other club on the other side of town, but he writes opioid ladies and gentlemen. Sorry. Lost my phone. You are welcome to come anytime. I wrote him two nights ago when I come to town, like going to the comedy store or you know, any of the places. That's where we first met. Yes. Yeah. We first met before ever. Did you show? We met at the comments, you don't always ask me why I love Joe Rogan so much and uh, when we were going through our shit for the sex and the church thing, you like stepped out and wrote a fucking article on the whole damn thing supporting us. Yeah, I was, I was horrified that no one was getting upset that you guys were getting. Oh, everyone was getting upset.

Speaker 1:          00:30:32       But I mean, you know what I mean. It wasn't like, it wasn't like a national free speech. Outraged man. You wrote a great article and that's when I started really realizing, you know what you're all about, you know, because I knew it for fear factory. I didn't even know that you're a standup at that. At that time we didn't know each other. And then when I saw your standup I was absolutely blown away because, you know, you leave thinking about shit. I liked that. I liked that from a standup, but I'm full time. What was going to say? Oh, um, there was no outrage because we didn't have the social networking like our fan base was. They were out of their minds. Like what do you mean you guys are getting kicked off the air, but there was no twitter back then. There was nothing.

Speaker 1:          00:31:12       So it's kind of like, I guess we've said on our show a bunch of times, you know, you hit your kick it and hill and all the ants go fucking scurrying, but they don't know what the fuck to do that. That was our fan base. They're all pissed off. They were running, you know, all sorts of directions, but they, they couldn't organize. Nowadays you can organize obviously. I thought it was the most ridiculous shit ever. The people were making a great outrage about the fact that someone had sex in a church that it's like you did something so horrible, man. They did something that everybody wants to do, but they didn't. The super secret special place. And when Magic House, why's it bad? They're not bad. They're, it's stupid. Why would it be worse if someone fucked in a supermarket? That was my point. It would be, I would think would be worse with someone at a toys r us.

Speaker 1:          00:31:57       Yeah. No, I get your point, but what would be the answer to why is it bad in the church? Is that disrespectful? It's a magic house. That's what they're saying. You know what I'm saying? That magic is real. And then all this fucking corny bullshit that's obviously not real, you know, really look these people with their stain glasses and there's a dude is being tortured to death and he's supposed to stare at that and feel bad. And I was in the vestibule anyway so I don't even think it was in the actual church and to this day I don't even know if they actually did it cost me two and a half years of my career. And you were one of the groups. I mean literally one of the only guys stepping forward. It was so gross. I couldn't believe it was real. I couldn't believe you guys are getting fired for that and I just, I just like, this is the craziest thing I've ever heard. Like if we don't stand up and say this is nothing,

Speaker 4:          00:32:40       this is not that big a deal, why are you making a big deal out of it? Not only that, it's, it's, it's funny. It is funny, you know that if they, if they did it anywhere else, would you have gotten in trouble? That's the real question. They did it a lot of other places that day, but that didn't get you in trouble. They don't even talk about the church that got you in trouble. So that's really saying that there's like a public policy. Well, the magic place Israel. Well here's the thing, the same day it was done in a toys r us. That's right. Yeah, that's right. Is Right about that. So it was a toy store and the church were the two biggies that day, but they didn't care about the fact that they did Schwartz, one of those, I think it might've been Fao Schwarz, the fact that that the reinforcing the idea that this magic place is actually a magic place.

Speaker 4:          00:33:27       Yeah. Yeah. It's really kind of creepy that people go there and they'd want to worship and then want to be like, you know, so like if they interrupted and certain [inaudible] and a bunch of people and in front of a bunch of people, but if no one knows about it, they actually pulled it off and I didn't get caught. Right. No. See, no. There was a security guard that saw it and actually he basically said, get the hell out of here. I don't want to deal with this shit. And then someone grandstand of that day and you know, it got. So the only person that saw it was a security guard. That was it. We were, we were done. We were good. He saw and he didn't want to deal with it. He didn't want to write it up. He didn't want to call anyone and then someone grand standard.

Speaker 4:          00:34:04       And then the guy basically it was like, all right, fine, if this is what you want. And then next thing you know, the cops got called wow. It was so real. We had a chance that we would have got away with it and then we would have went to our bosses like that, man. Then I, we're just making belief. It's just so silly. But that fucked us up, man. We've, we've never come back from. That was so fucking big. Yeah. You guys were gigantic. Fuck. And then the world changed by the time we got back. Yeah. Two and a half fucking years. Two and a half years. Isn't it funny that, you know, people get addicted to other shows. They just like, whoa. They lock onto a show and then they just get a. They get into it. If you take it away from them for a couple of years, things changed.

Speaker 4:          00:34:42       Well, they came back, but I mean, you know, then we're competing with everything else. Yeah. You know, to this. Now look, everyone's podcasting, everyone's on their phones, you know, now you're competing with some idiot that just wants to look at tweets all day. So I try to get their attachment. Could you have done podcasting at that point existed? No. Nothing? No. There was nothing to do. We had a wait. They actually paid up and pee. You Go pee. Yeah. But do you love doing this? Yeah. You know, someone took this away from you for two and a half years or the UFC for two and a half years, but they were paying you. Would you be cool with that Joe Rogan? No, I'd be sad. And plus the fact that I, I knew that another company would hire us, you know, uh, immediately to continue where we were.

Speaker 4:          00:35:26       Yeah. You would have immediately gotten. But our company said, fuck that. We're paying every single dollar, but you can't do nothing. That's so gross. What a Shitty fucking company policy. So I tried to get out of my contract at the time, but my agent was a little scared because he was getting his piece. He was getting his taste. So I'm like, oh, we'll get this whole fucking thing back together. Oh, that's so yucky. That's a contract. Conflict of interest isn't. I mean we're making, doing something that we're making good money. And he was getting his 10 percent. Yeah, that's a conflict. Why would, why would he call the company and go, Hey, you know, my boys went out, but I'd call them like weekly. I'm like, get the fuck out of this contract. Because at the time clear chow was the big radio company. They want us immediately, they wanted to put us on a q and a for New York.

Speaker 4:          00:36:15       So what, what, you know, what did they want money to get a payoff to get you out of the contract? Did they or would you have had to just take a chance? I had sued. I um, wait, what was that again? Because I had a flip there. Oh, it was. I said why would they want money? Like it was the company that don't. Who owns you guys? It was CBS, CBS, xfinity product. They have accepted money to get out of that, you know, that, you know. So how could you say people get to say you're full of Shit, but I know it says I know this to be true. They didn't want us to compete with Howard. Uh, because they knew we'd go across the street, do mornings. Would we beat Howard stern warnings? I don't know, I would like to think we'd have a pretty good shot at back then especially.

Speaker 4:          00:36:59       And uh, they were killing it. We worked in this fucking huge and, and afternoons they knew at the very least we're going to take a, you know, a nice chunk of his audience away and that, that was a lot of money to the company. So they sat down in a board room and they said, look, it's better that we pay these fucking guys for two and a half years instead of taking the chance them going up against our main guy. That is a fact. Well, if that's the case, you know, if they probably looked at their own profits and how much it would cost to pay you off, they probably figured it was worth the gamble. Oh No. They made everything. They made way more money us. That's how weird. That's how fucked up the business was so strained as they used to. They used to talk about it.

Speaker 4:          00:37:37       It was a business where, you know, where you just printed up money. They just printed up money and what the advertisers were. We're just paying a fucking lot of money for their ads. How much has the radio business changed since the Internet? Uh, drastically. Massively, right? Yeah. They're stupid because at, at the time you need personality driven radio. They, they said fuck that. So the two biggest formats on regular radio is sports talk, which anyone could do. No offense those guys. But you know, that stuff is easy to study and then it's a pop music. That's it. No talk shows are left. Really? Yeah. It's hard. You were saying earlier, Kevin being they have to, they have to play their music now too. I think they've always done it that way. You think? Thanks. I feel like I remember a time where they were street talk show, but you know, they're, they're good dudes. I, I just think that the future is not looking good for like regular radio company. Their model that they operated under. It's just really deteriorated. Right? There's too many options

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       and we'll like stitcher and your car. You could listen to this podcast anytime you won your car. Just set that up and bang. Yeah. You download them and put it on your phone. You can get them all off itunes. I got it right here. So easy to do. I got it right here. It's really hard for a radio station to compete that, especially if they have the wacky dj voice. You guys are one of the first to shit all over the place. You really made it obvious, you know, and then there was obvious to everyone. It is obvious to everyone, but nobody brings it up. One of my favorite bits we do every year is that Jack Tobar bit. Yeah. I love that. So many radio shows are so fucking pissed off at us, but it's like you look at yourselves, we're actually trying to help you out.

Speaker 1:          00:39:17       Why are you still doing that type of radio? October. So October. We just, uh, we feature one show every day for the month of October. Just beat the shit out of them, but they're all doing the same thing. You know, there's, there's shows that they have to have a woman, which we call the whole obviously, but that's a DM program director. They get like, they would get like youtube together, right. And then they would throw a woman and for her point of view, yeah, I'm not really interested. Course, it's not that I'm a misogynist, but I am a man talking to men and they have a to women too. They have a tendency to fucking put up the yield sign or the stop sign like, Oh, you know, knock it off. So yeah, I mean we've been. So we've been offered females over the years and we just said, hell fucking no.

Speaker 1:          00:40:05       I mean we'll have females on our show to do well, you know, they do really well. They could, they could hold their own, but to have someone in there on a regular basis, oh, that would be a fucking nightmare. I mean, you'd have to have the perfect mix of personalities because otherwise there's. Look, there's nothing wrong with women like. But what women like and men like is varies drastically big fucking difference. And when women are in the mix, if you're trying to do anything, especially something creative along these lines, when it's, uh, it's like freeform conversational type shit. If a woman is in the mix on a regular basis, it changes the entire dynamic of the show. Are you going to watch and everything you're saying? Yeah. You gotTa Watch everything you're saying and to try not to be as rude. No. All right. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:40:48       You gotta you gotta definitely not shit on her. The way you should on each other. You're going to be very aware of. You can't talk shit to check the way you could tell it like you just say the French shut up stupid. No, and that's fine, but no one ever gets upset. But if you say that to a girl, shut up stupid like, eh. I think our female listeners understand that too, because they're like, wait, we get to hear like guys unfiltered. Yes. Because you know the guys in their lives, they're around their wives or their girlfriends. They're not unfiltered. So radio shows like yourself and ours, you know, they, they like to kind of take that peak and listen to it. Yeah. That's the only opportunity they can. Just like when me, when I listened to out cute gay radio, I don't listen. That's the only way I don't ever hear that gay people have like conversations. Is it good? I really don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:41:33       I really don't know. They're nice guys know hall, but there's um, I guess I guess I check them out. I just get a kick out of. I get a kick out of listening to everything. I like listening to conservative talk radio. I like listening to like those really silly conservative guys where everything is fucking 100 percent. It's Joe's. Yeah. Down the road. Well he's, he's little weirder. Alex has a lot of shit in there. Like he thinks marijuana should be legal. Gay Marriage should be legal. He's just a conspiracy theorists to the. You scared me for awhile because I'm like, man, Joe Rogan is a really smart dude. And you were really into the Alex Jones and I miss. Hold on, I misread it. And we finally had that conversation and you, you said it, you're like, I believe. What 20 percent did you say? Like it depends.

Speaker 1:          00:42:17       It depends on the subject. Sometimes I believe 70 to 80 percent of the way it says. Fair enough. Because the last time he was on our show, I was surprised how much I was taking what he was saying. But then there's been other times it's been ridiculous. It's crazy, but he's awesome and fun to listen. Do It's an act. No, I know him really well. It's not an act. He's my friend, but I've, I've. I've known that guy for over 10 years now. Alex Jones is exactly who he presented. I can. You're not going to give me the total. No, no, no, no, no. I'm telling you. I'm telling you this, that he. He understands conspiracy, like living in that world is as good for his business. So he, he forces some of this shit to continue to live in the conspiracy world. I, I, I understand why you would see that, but I don't believe it's that what I believe it is more of it's confirmation bias that happens when someone gets really fixated on the idea that there's a conspiracy everywhere.

Speaker 1:          00:43:12       So they start seeing conspiracies in places that they're not right, but it doesn't mean that the validity of some of the shit he's brought up, the validity of some of the shit he's brought up was unquestionable. Right now. There's a lot of stuff that he brings up. And by the way, he was bringing it up way ahead of anybody else he was, he was talking about he during the first days of September 11th, he was calling it a false flag attack. And he was saying that, um, you know, there was a, there was possible that, you know, buildings were detonated and like he was sticking himself way, way, way out on a limb. And when he did that, I was like, wow man, you can't. I was like, you can't say that. That's crazy. You can't, you know, you can't, you can't say that they're willing to go to war for profit.

Speaker 1:          00:43:55       I thought he was being nuts. I was talking to him. I was like, you know, you're just drawing all these conclusions, but next thing you know, we're at war with Iraq and nobody understands why. And you know, he's saying it's for profiteering, they're profiteering over there. Right? I don't believe that he's right about like September 11th being orchestrated by the government. I don't think it was orchestrated by the government, but I do think that capitalized. Well, of course. I mean, one of my thoughts on that is if you want, let's say you want to bring your country to war, right? And you know that there's some shit that could be going down in New York City like planes going into the fucking buildings, you know, that would be technically really good for the country because then you would, like you said profiteer and, and, and, uh, head off to war.

Speaker 1:          00:44:38       Why when you let it just happen. Well, one of them was, that's where, that's where I'm, that's where my line is, where I wonder in that it's like a gray area to me, but to, to think that, you know, people were wiring the buildings while people were going in and out of work. That's just ridiculous. Yeah. I put them possibly let things happen and go, you know what? All right, we know this is going down, but you know, it's not the worst thing for what our agenda right now. It's possible. The real issue is the idea of the false flag and the idea of the false flag is the idea that the government would plan out a fake attack, would they do that? And for most people that answer's no, no. Most people say the government would never do that, but the real problem is they've done it.

Speaker 1:          00:45:19       They really actually have done it. Not only have they done it, they've planned on doing it a bunch of, other times they couldn't pull it off. There was one from when the Bush administration was leaving. They were talking about in 2007, I believe it was. They were talking about, uh, going into, uh, Iran and coming up with a false flag attack and in order to get us into war with Iran before the administration was to set the, you know, the next administration has said Obama Administration into some crazy fucking war that he couldn't control. Now in the end, is that good for the country in their minds? I know, I think it's profiteering. I really do. I think there's any other of your buddies, right? There's no other way and it has nothing to do with actually make the country stronger in the end. If you can't justify it militarily, if you can't justify the reason why you're there, then you profiteering and you know, it's just, it's really that simple.

Speaker 1:          00:46:07       It's like someone profiting amps Fuckin lutely. Okay, so you can't justify when you're there and someone's profiting. That means it's about the profit and that's something that we don't like to hear. We don't. We, we don't like to accept that shit in this country. And Alex Jones, Patriotic Alex Jones brings up all that shit. The northwoods document and the northwest documentaries in the 19 sixties, 1962, I think it was before Kennedy was assassinated. They saw the joint chiefs of Staffs Sinus. They agreed on this. They were going to fake a bunch of attacks on America by the Cubans. They were going to blow up a drone jet. They're going to take a jet flight in the air with radio control. Then blow it up in the sky. They're going to blame it on the cube and said, we're going to arm a Cuban friendlies in there. We're going to lob mortars at Guantanamo, Bang, possibly killing American civilians or citizens rather, and they were going to do all this so that we would get angry and we would want to go to war with Cuba because the only way we could get to go to war with Cuba, they wrote all this down.

Speaker 1:          00:47:08       They're like, we're good to go. Then I'm not. Kennedy was like, get the fuck Outta here with this. Kennedy vetoed it. Where were you at Kennedy? But he said they killed them. I'm almost positive. I quite a few people. It was quite a few people wanted that guy. What's his name? Came out what? A couple days ago, right? Robert Kennedy's kid and them wanted to do it. No, he said there's definitely. You know that that was definitely a conspiracy. I don't think there's any question. I mean, I think there's a lot of people that want to tie things up in a neat little packages. I think that's the least tie. A little neat little package on earth. I really don't, just the video alone, there's a prude or video. The fact that you know that they had to attribute all those wounds to one bullet because they found a bullet that hit an underpass and ricocheted and so they were like, they were coming up with a logical reasons why all these wounds.

Speaker 1:          00:47:58       It's kind of from three shots. It's kind of insulting our intelligence, right? Yeah. Why would they say why would they limit it to three shots? Because I was the only amount feasible for this guy to pull off course to make, to make it. One guy had to be no more than three shots and it doesn't mean Lee Harvey Oswald wasn't in on it. I don't know. He could have been. What the fuck it been. He had a long history with the CIA. Had a long history of being, living Russia, possibly being a Russian spy mean we with. There's a lot that points to the fact that Lee Harvey Oswald was doing some shady shit to. You ever been to Dealey Plaza? Yeah, I've been there. Have you been. There were. No, those whack jobs come out, but their books and their card tables. No, there's still reliving. Oh, the day.

Speaker 1:          00:48:38       And they all have something to sell. Oh, you haven't seen that? No, I drove through it. No Man. Next time you, you played Dallas, you have to go to Dealey Plaza and you have to hang out there for like three or four hours. Well, we drove through it and it's so weird piece of history. It's smaller than. Yeah, it's tiny and it, it, it looks like, um, it looks like a Hollywood stage, right? It looks like a set for a movie because nothing has really changed. I mean the trees have grown. That's about it. But these people that were there that day, they're all. You talk about profiteering to this day. They're profitero and they go there everyday and try to sell their pamphlet or their book or, or whatever the fuck it. Someone like you, you would love it. Love that. Sandy Hook, uh, fully exposed video that's been announced.

Speaker 1:          00:49:23       I saw that they tried to say it's a conspiracy conspiracy. Like how, you know, like there was two other shooters and they show like even footage that like the news of people like, like the police catching a guy in the woods and then whatever happened to that guy and have some of the kids. So did the police catch him or not? Can't they just talked to the police or the policing on it as well? Well, I'm waiting for somebody to debunk that. I've seen the videos. I'm like, something's got to be wrong here. They were saying that the tribute video was put up a month in advance and I was like, how do you know that someone did just edit something and write it up? Another video I like. It could've been a post that was made a month ago. They did something else and they just took out the stuff and put it.

Speaker 1:          00:50:03       The regular video in that could have been at. There's ways to like fake a timestamp if you ever, you know, previous posts of your editing. I don't know whether or not that's real, but I, I do know that whenever anything happens now, a million people for conspiracy, even if it doesn't make any sense, even though there's no conspiracy, I love a good conspiracy of love. A good guy. We grew up with that shit. Do you believe the, uh, a big foot. That's a good one, man. I'm really. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. This is the reason why. Two reasons. One then was going to ask you about blackness, which is on the same page. We get Jane Goodall, who's a world famous primatologist she believes in big five. No. Yeah. One hundred percent. Yeah. She says she's convinced that there's an undiscovered primate [inaudible]. I'm pretty sure that's her exact words.

Speaker 1:          00:50:49       She's convinced. So there's an undiscovered primate living in the Pacific northwest. So we're. The fuckers is the remains. Well, the deal is, well, you know, we had a hunter on yesterday. This Guy Steven Rinella, and we were talking about animals like, has he ever seen a dead mountain lion? No, never seen a dead mountain lion. You know, you could. And he's a hunter. He's in the woods constantly. We know mountain lions are real, but what are the odds of running around and finding it dead? One it. It's pretty fucking small, but no one has found a skeleton. Skeletal remains and nothing. Nothing credible. Nothing credible. But Mountain Lion? No, no, no, no, no. I'm talking about for bigfoot. Okay. Yeah, but I'm saying I know that, but the reason why Jane Goodall believes that it might be a real animal is because there was a real animal that looked just like that and it lived alongside people.

Speaker 1:          00:51:34       It's called gigantic Pythagoras and the photos of them are kind of crazy. Like they have a recreation at one, but it's an eight foot tall bipedal giant sasquatch. I mean, that's really what it is. But they have actual proof that it lives. Oh, he lived. Yeah, he lived 100 years ago because they have bones. Oh, they do updates that someone was talking about. I believe that that actually was one of the few primates that stores. It's dead. Like they buried their dead. They had like, they're dead in one area. Right? So they think they, you know, they might've understood life and death more than other chimps who just sort of leave their monkey bodies laying around after they die, you know, they took care of the bodies, you know, which is really kind of freaky. And if they were really, really smart and multiple, all primates are smart, you know, they're all reasonably smart because it was a gigantic one.

Speaker 1:          00:52:18       Does that big? It could be smart as fuck, but I mean everyone's searching for it now. Who searching or, you know, I don't know anybody. I just feel like I could say that. Say that it's true. You don't think like people. I mean that would be amazing for somebody if they could prove that bigfoot know spike has a new show. It's like a $10,000,000 challenge or something crazy like that to find big for my. I think I have said too much money, so don't blame me. It might not be 10 million or whatever it is. There's a lot of money to go find big foot and it's a good concept. Yeah, it's a fucking great concept. You know, and you got to go deep into the woods and look for something. The only guy that I've ever heard tell a big foot store. I heard him tell it on your show and then he came and told it on my podcast.

Speaker 1:          00:53:03       It was Les Stroud, survivor man, right. His, his big foot story was a pretty credible because that guy, what did he say? Yes, he was. He had to, to um, different encounters. One of 'em he was in Alaska and this is the most memorable and he was in his tent and sleeping and it was just lying in his tent trying to go to sleep. And he heard thumping through the woods by Peta lease and it was walking on two legs clearly. And he goes and it was really heavy. You could tell it was really heavy and he didn't know what to do. So he just laid there and waited and it got closer to him and it was coming towards his camp and he said it was about 50 feet from him. It started

Speaker 5:          00:53:41       both

Speaker 1:          00:53:44       like he goes clear primate, sounds like clear primate sounds. And he goes and reaches for his camera and when he rustles the thing runs off and the thing runs off. He says, it's running on two legs. I hear it. Thump, thump, thump, thump. Fuck. 10. You know, and he to this day, is he? He's convinced that it was a bear. He said there's no way that was a fucking bear. There's no way it. I know I've been around every animal, you know, he's a real survivalist. You know what I'm saying? Like that guy goes out there with the fucking pocket life and it can last a month. Where it was he who is in Alaska. Oh, you said he was hundreds of miles from anybody to do. They follow him in on a plane for hours before they dropped him off for a week and he runs into this fucking animal out there.

Speaker 1:          00:54:27       There's been a lot of sightings in, in Alaska by the way. It's not just one. There's hundreds of bigfoot sightings and Alaska. We got to catch one though. Yeah, we do too. Are you scared of the woods? Fuck. You should be scared of the woods. Fucking scared. She'd be scared of everything, everything natural because then you become a part of the food chain here. When a studio, the beautiful thing about the studio, we have eliminated the food chain 100 percent. It's just us in a fucking table and yeah, you don't have to like look out for Jaguars and shit. If you live somewhere that sucked, you'd have to look out for Jaguars. Well, you know when you're going into the jungle, are you going into the woods? It's a beautiful thing, you know, to be with nature. It's beautiful, but you also agree to be a part of nature.

Speaker 1:          00:55:05       You throw yourself back into the lottery, right? You know, and it's fun for the first couple of minutes and then you start seeing those shadows and fucking mind plays tricks on you. I was in Montana. I went hunting for a week. That's cool. Yeah. We went with the. Steve Rinella was on yesterday. I shot this thing. Woops. Wait, you shot this thing? Yeah, I shot this thing. What is it? That's a deer. That's a nice, uh, how many points? Eight a point. Fucking deer we're looking at right now. Just the skull and the antlers. It was a interesting experience. But to um, to camp out like five nights in a, in, in, you know, like this really wild habitat like that man, you really, you start looking around for stuff. You really keep up. We found Mountain Lion Shit, right? That was a real eyeopener. Like you see a big fat rope of shit with hair it and you're like, okay, something killed a deer with its face.

Speaker 1:          00:56:03       Jesus. It caught a deer and killed it with its face. It's hanging out here, dropping shits. So how did, how did you know you were safe? Well, we had rifles. Now at night when you're sleeping, well, you're in a tent. You know, it's gonna know where to attack in the tent. It looks at a 10. It's this big thing that doesn't totally understand they, when they smell, if you have food in the Tan or something like that, especially bears, it can get really tricky. But there's no bears in this area. Like mountain lions are really scavengers. They're looking to kill things. I got to ask you, so how is it a to kill Salta? It's not that hard. No. You're all right with that. Yeah. Yeah. I'm fine with that because I've been eating meat my whole life and if you don't kill them, it's not like they live forever.

Speaker 1:          00:56:46       You know what you're doing is you're, you're ending their life in you. You're, you're choosing to end their life. But their life is very temporary. It's very temporary in a very harsh climate. And if you don't do it, they get eaten by wolves. Now I'm not questioning that. I just don't think I could do it. You can do it. Of course you could. Your, your personal. You want to be alive. Let me tell you something. You're a father. Does it bother you at all though? No, not even a little bit. No. I mean, I have respect for it. I have reverence for the animal. I mean it was, uh, you know, seeing an animal in the wild like that is, you know, I don't want to use the word majestic, but it's a, it's a really powerful moment. Like you see that animal like wild, like it's probably never seen a human being before we were in the bad lands in Montana and you're, you're running into a deer that very likely is, you know, three years old, two, three years old, and I never, never seen a person ever.

Speaker 1:          00:57:37       And then you're sneaking up on them and shoot them. You know, it's pretty intense, but the food is delicious. It's really nutritious and healthy. And if you're a person who eats animal protein, I can understand the ethics behind, uh, not wanting to cause harm to animals, not wanting to kill them, but especially in the case of big game hunting like deer, all you're doing is you're, you're ending their life before a Predator takes them out. They all get taken out, but they get taken out and I know they're over populated. All, you know, how many deer die of old age? Zero, zero. Literally zero. They're just fucking making babies. Wolves are pulling the babies out of the Mamas Pussy while they're giving birth. I mean, there's a crazy life. You're out there in the woods is fucked up podcast. It's as dark as it gets out there in the dear world, so when you come along and blow their heart out with a bullet, I'll have to try it.

Speaker 1:          00:58:28       Then. It's really like the safest. I mean not the safest. It's the most humane way for them to die ever. You know, it's. I could understand people's points of view, like if you want to be a Vegan, if you want to be a vegetarian, you don't want to cause any harm. I, I totally understand that, but I think if you do accept that most people eat meat and that is the case in this culture. Most people eat meat. This is the most humane way to acquire the meat and all you're doing is acting as a Predator in a world filled with predators. You're not denying any other animal the predation, and in fact the idea is that if done correctly, it keeps the animal populations healthy. Silicon fucking starve to death. I understand all that. I'm just thinking of what goes on in your head.

Speaker 1:          00:59:07       That's. No, it didn't. I was ready for it. I had prepared myself for it for a long time, so I wanted to do this the first time. Yeah, the shots. Yeah. Wow. Cool. You know, and it's not like, um, it's a very respectful thing. I mean, you're eating, I'm eating on this whole animal, you know, it takes months to eat it. There's a lot of meat. Yeah. It's processed and cut. And I lived in western New York. We had a lot of venison. Chili. Oh yeah. I didn't like it. Western New York is a lot of fucking deer. No Shit. When you take that ride from buffalo to long island where I brought, you know, I was uh, brought up all we used to count how many dead deer on the top of the cars. Yeah. You see a lot of hundreds. Yeah. Yeah. Because, you know, especially during hunting season and all that, and then on the side of the road and all that crap, a lot of people get their cars fucked up by those deer to.

Speaker 1:          00:59:54       Yeah. That's why it's very important to keep deer populations down. Like people don't understand. Like if, if gear populations get really big, first of all, you got a lot of lyme disease as well, that, that happens to ticks travel from deer to deer and they get into people and you know, lyme disease and people's fucking devastating to your health. Right. And a lot of that is overpopulation, is these fucking deer. They get, I mean, they can get, there's a, there's a, a road from Massachusetts, western Massachusetts to uh, New York to like the White Plains area. I forget what the road it is probably a, I want to say [inaudible] 91 maybe. Whatever it is. There's a, it's a two lane road. No, at one point when you're like, I'm not too late. Two lanes on each side for later. I guess a way way up in the upstate Massachusetts in western Massachusetts as you're driving down in New York, it gets so bad with deer that you got to go like 20 miles an hour.

Speaker 1:          01:00:46       It's fucking crazy. They're just darting out in front of the lights, just running out in front of your car. You ever see when get hit by a car? Yeah, yeah, I've seen like fuck up. It's pretty fucked up. Yeah. I've seen a bunch of them on the side of the road, you know, in boulder. It's weird. They're not scared of cars at all. They don't even run. They just stand there. Really? Yeah. Boulder. There was a deer. We parked the car, got out, the deer was 20 feet away, 20 feet away and we're all just standing there looking at them and there's like, Hey, what the fuck you bitches looking at it and it just keeps eating this grass. It was just used to it. They're so used to it. It was just used to cars. We took a picture of him and got back in the car and he jumped across the fence.

Speaker 1:          01:01:24       I haven't run out, but they get used to people and you know, if you don't keep those populations down, they're going to be slamming into your cars at night and they're like little crazy squirrels, you know, but they'll kill you. Like they'll go through your windshield. No kidding. Have you ever seen those photos online? Have giant through the, through the windshield, but they're beautiful. I understand that. Beautiful. I'm not saying we should eradicate them, but we should eat them. You know, there's nothing wrong with the eating them. There's plenty of them. I was just trying to get into your head. Oh, I was just curious because I've never done it. That's all. Well, I never did it until this time and I wondered whether or not I was going to have a problem with it. But uh, I eat meat. I've always eaten meat. I like it.

Speaker 1:          01:02:04       It's delicious. Of course it would be hypocritical. It's one of my favorite foods in the world. Which one? Snake snakes? Yeah. He just love it. Steak over misskey. Misskey lump charcoal and salt and pepper. Bitch. And throw it out there. Do you go with the grass fed? Do you ever have the grass fed is terrific. It's fucking beef. Yes. Very nice. Really good. It's interesting. It's a different kind of taste and it's way better for your body to. What are you drinking over there? Step bulletproof coffee shit that I told you about, but it's made with butter. Yes. It's made with grass fed butter. What do you learn about this shit? This is a guy named Dave asprey who came onto Brian, tells me everything. He's my, he's my Yoda. Brian knows this shit. No, it's like Yoda, Yoda, like pretending to be stupid background with all the brightest.

Speaker 1:          01:02:48       One point on my strengths, the um, this guy, uh, that we had on the podcast, Dave Asprey, he, uh, gave us a really fascinating speech about Mycotoxins, some that I wasn't aware of, but most coffee when you buy coffee from a store like starbucks or something like that, it has mold on it and the way that, like a coffee is stored in the way of coffee is treated when it comes off of, right out of the plantations taken care of to is directly proportionate to how healthy it is for you and those mycotoxins. You haven't moldy coffee or really fucking bad for you. That's where liver toxicity and all these different, these different effects that he like. There's an issue with some coffee is not bad for you at all, but other coffee shows like bad liver markings and what that is, is fungus. It's in corn and it's in coughing to the bunch of different shit.

Speaker 1:          01:03:43       What kind of coffee is it? A lot of different colleges. Big Guys. Will you ever see there's a show called the dangerous grounds show is about a dude who. He's on the travel channel. He travels to all these different exotic places where they make coffee like shows you what it's like to acquire coffee and these tropical lands on and he was saying that somewhere between 70 plus percent of all the coffee you get has mold on it and that could be a health issue. So when people are talking about the health issues of coffee, Dave asprey guy says they're talking about mycotoxins and when you're dealing with toxin free, clean fungus, free coffee, you don't have nearly as many issues and the energy does it. You don't crash afterwards. What he's saying is that you're basically being poisoned by shitty coffee. Isn't the water killing all that stuff?

Speaker 1:          01:04:31       No. That's the crazy thing about fungus. Not too good. I know it's getting worse. It sounds like it's fake. You should get a stephen hawkings device was one of those little things and click, click, click. I don't want to do it. I don't want to get strep man. Oh, he's not contagious at that. Yeah. Just don't make out with them. Um, your question. No, they can't. It doesn't. The boiling, it doesn't kill them. See, they can survive in space. They can survive on radiation. Yeah. Spores can survive and insane places. That's one of the main reasons why some people believe that a magic mushrooms came from outer space. The idea being that there's, there's, they're very different and far as the chemical composition from other mushrooms and other and they mirror human neurochemistry and they could survive in a vacuum that did survive incredible radiation and we know that certain shit has come here from asteroids.

Speaker 1:          01:05:26       We know water's come here from asteroids. We know that things have hit other planets and sent things to us and could have contained organic matter. We know, we know all that, so they're pretty sure that these fucking spores, these spores can survive in space. And that's how we got some of these mushrooms. Well, you know that's like prior to that shit that causes mad cow disease that can survive like a thousand degrees for like seven days or something crazy like that. Like they're, they're in, they're insanely tolerant. Does this stuff keeps you awake at night? Know your head is filled with a lot of fucked up. Fucked up. It's fucked up. You know, that's a compliment. But it's just the way I say it. So can I take a fucking lake? Yeah. Go take a leak. Go through that door and say what happens if I take a leak?

Speaker 1:          01:06:12       You guys could come on right back. We'll, we'll keep talking. This is casual as fuck man. It's the Internet. You looking at the CEO's of the company right here. You just never take a break. We do whatever we want. So if I needed to take a break, if I leave, will he be talking about me? No, unless you want me to help fucking though. Whatever you want. Man wants to be talked about whether or not in the room. Are you checking your twitter like a little girl? What are you doing here, man? Yeah. It was just checking it out. Why not get a couple of plugs in? That would help. Fuck. Got a few followers for Christ sake. Follow OPI radio. O P I e Dot. Go through that door and take a right right here. Wouldn't talk some shit about you. Where you're going.

Speaker 1:          01:06:49       What's that? Yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah, yeah. Really? Yeah. You got. Yeah, there's a story. I knew a motherfucker. We got to hear something. There's a story. He's got something to show us. So a poor, poor Brian. You got the band aids and uh, you should call Peter Duesberg up right now. And tell him to go fuck himself. Okay. Listen, Peter Duesberg, I got mouth aids. Yeah. STREP is no joke. Two, how many days is stripped a contagious for a, I think it's the first 48 hours. Forty eight hours after taking the medication and how many hours you've been taking the medication? Seventy two. So you buffed it give a little buffer. It feels like there's a piece of glass in my throat. Dude, you sound like you're sucking cock for years. Like they just put you on a cock sucking plant. You know, you just for for a year, you were in a cock sucker plantation and that's what they did.

Speaker 1:          01:07:41       They just lined you up and you got to just suck hawks all day for years. Can you imagine a world would that existed? Would that was the punishment that someone would bestow upon you? GotTa Suck Cox for years, for years and years and years and years. You have two years in the cock sucking factory. So they sent me someplace and your life's existence is you get four hours sleep a night and the rest of the time while you're awake, you're sucking decks. That's your whole day. You get like five minutes to shove some food down your throat, five minutes to shit twice a day. And then the rest of it is just sucking or death.

Speaker 6:          01:08:17       Your choice.

Speaker 1:          01:08:22       There was a guy who did something to someone and paralyzed him and the punishment that they gave him was to paralyze him

Speaker 6:          01:08:31       medically. Yeah. I forget what the story was. I going to find, uh, the ruling judge's ruling. This was like a, I want to say a couple of years ago. They apparently has a man found guilty of paralysis. Okay. Let's see. Apparel

Speaker 1:          01:08:48       paralyzes them. One of those words we learned.

Speaker 7:          01:08:55       Oh,

Speaker 6:          01:08:56       paralysis.

Speaker 1:          01:09:01       Perfect.

Speaker 6:          01:09:05       What happened?

Speaker 1:          01:09:06       I'm talking about some guy who, uh, Saudi Arabia was gonna paralyze a man who crippled another man.

Speaker 1:          01:09:16       [inaudible] w I wonder how this, they were going to. This guy had crippled someone so they were trying to, uh, they wanted a severed his spinal cord cripple him as punishment. Right? And people got really fucking freaked out about it. The Guy, um, he stabbed someone and severed their spinal cord and they were going to do the same thing to him because under Sharia law, this guy, uh, his victim requested that really? Yeah, I just live in that world under Sharia law. This was his right to seek to wacky as part of the world. They still deal with. I mean, as an adult and especially as a father when you read about the, the, the craziness in the world when you see like some woman who was just gunned down because she was a, they thought she possibly has been guilty of adultery. So the guy gunder down the street and everybody's fine with it and you're allowed to.

Speaker 1:          01:10:16       How these honor killings is don't stick. Our country could use a little of that honor killings. We'll just something. What do you mean? Fuck man, like the Aurora shooter. I don't feel like seeing his fucking face on the news every day. Why can't we just take them out back and shoot him in the fucking head? Okay. But that's a big difference between that and honored that. I was just bringing it all together. No, of course I don't want honor killings in America. I was like, what do you think? I think we're a bunch of pussies as far as we take care of some of these fucking people. You want to take care of school shootings? Fucking fucking take these guys out immediately. Yeah. You have to also find out what the fuck is going on with her mind though in keeping them alive. You can study them. You could find out what, what we might be able to prevent ones in the future. We might have like markers or flags that they think, yeah, they gotta they gotta figure out what it is psychologically and they also have to figure out what it is. I'm chemically right, because a lot of these guys are on antidepressants more than 90 percent of. In fact, I think.

Speaker 4:          01:11:14       I think the mental illness part of this whole equation is way worse than the fucking gun part. Yeah, you're, you're right. Absolutely right. I mean, Timothy, Timothy Mcveigh killed a lot of people with fertilizer. Right? If somebody wants to kill you, they can kill you. And I agree with you. Yeah. This is such a weird chill environment. Is it? Yeah, man. Just do it. So out of my element. No, you know, but it's cool though, but what I'm trying to step out of my comfort zone does these days different things. Yeah. Because like the type of radio show I do, I, I, I could almost do it in my sleep now. Right, right, right. And you got to test environment to me is really fucking strange. I'm just, I'm just pointing out some shit. You guys have really become a home for the comedian hangout, right? You know, we used to hate comics on the, on the, uh, show.

Speaker 4:          01:12:01       Really? Yeah. When we're in Boston. Wow. We fucking hated it. And then when we first kicked in New York, we fucking hate it because we had guys that came in and instead of just having the conversation we're having or just be funny because if you're a standup, can't you just be funny and about a lot of these guys at first because we weren't getting the quality comics either because we just starting out, they came in and they wanted their pit set up. Why can't you just come in and have a conversation and maybe we'll fit in one of your bits or whatever. I don't give a fuck, but let's talk about some shit and maybe you get some jokes out there. So we actually avoid a comics for a long fucking time. And then, you know, when you do radio in New York, you can't avoid it.

Speaker 4:          01:12:43       And we finally embraced it and you know, we'd love it. Of course we love when you guys come in. Well, you guys figured out how to do it the perfect way, then let real comics come in and just fuck around and shoot the shit and talk shit and it creates these unbelievably hysterical moment. Sure. Whereas, you know, if you got a guy just come in and set up as bits, how long can you do that for you? That's not even a real conversation, but that's what they want. A lot of radio stations they like even I did, I did a big radio station like a couple of years ago and they still asked me to do this. Oh really? They go, we would like you to know, uh, what questions you would like to be asked to set up your bids. And I go set up my bits.

Speaker 4:          01:13:22       And the guy was like, disappointed. They're like, what bits are you going to do? I go, what am I going to do? What we did not, we did not know who's coming into your fucking show. Yeah. I can understand if it's somebody where maybe the comedy club made you take him, but someone like you. Really it was, why would you waste your time with that shit? I only did it because I was not. I don't mean you then when they had an opportunity to have you just, you know, talking on the radio show itself was great. It was the producer that was just weirded me out with all the was so disappointed in me that I didn't have bits of prepared and I was like, what bits are you going to do? And I was like, what are you talking about man? Can we just go out there, put us, put us on that radio thing, right? Get out of here. You're fucking my head man. Exactly. And those dudes do fuck with your head too because part of like a fun radio show is like having a good time and being relaxed

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       and when you're around someone who's super tense, what they don't understand as they tend to you up to. Right? You're like, why you so weirded out about me going on the radio or stop being a pussy. Just press play. Well with that said, how many cool shows are, are there out there? Very few. Right? It's like a handful, a handful, handful scattered across the country named five. Kevin had been in la for sure, and I'll say this, there might be, there might be more. I'm just telling you named five because you're going to piss off somebody. No, I can't. Then I'll stop right there. I'm not because I don't mean to know, but I'm just, I'm just want to hear any nonsense from Alex Jones. Alex Jones, all you need, ladies and gentlemen, we've got Internet radio. We've got live radio. We are a hundred people strong in affiliate.

Speaker 3:          01:14:56       One of the best things is when Jim Norton said, uh, about Alex Jones and never thought of. He brought up this brilliant point. Was that how he always talks about like the government is, they're changing the papers. They're doing this with the papers, but then he uses the government's research and papers for other points. But it's true. It's like you can't do both, right? You can, but it's not as effective. That sounds like it hurts a lot to tell them.

Speaker 1:          01:15:21       Yeah. Yeah. That's like fucked up. Yeah, he definitely does do that. I mean, look. Well, don't worry about all that, but Alex is also a guy who, uh, you know, he'll, he'll research shit that a lot of people wouldn't. He'll find out some things and a lot of people wouldn't. Maybe he's a little wacky. Yeah, I would say. Yeah, he's a little wacky. My Pierce Morgan, it was awesome. I loved, it was just great fucking TV. It's just great theater. I just went, loved it when he was pretending when he was having the English accent, who's was talking to a peer. So I think it's actually, it's like Alex, you crazy motherfucker. I wouldn't have blamed peers if you punched him at that point, but yeah, he appears, I think in the end it's just a fucking pussy. Yeah, he really did say you're just a pussy.

Speaker 1:          01:16:02       He seems very gross to me. I Dunno. Peers. Yeah. Some very dirty. There's some. Yeah, there's something going on there and he got into some shit over there in England, so he's dirty. Yeah. But it's just like, I think he's a very intelligent guy and he's a very good host. But man, I feel like if he was involved in tabloid journalism before, this is what she was. Yeah. It just seems like, why would you, why do you want to talk to that guy right there? Those kind of guys are gross. Like that thing, the tabloid journalism like that. It's just really. And they did this sneaky shit. They like listening on people's phones and stuff. That was peers. Yeah. That is really gross. That's really gross stuff. You know? It's like, why? Why would anybody want to get involved with that? But Alex wanted to deport them because he said something about the second amendment is going after him.

Speaker 1:          01:16:48       It's like, so it was just great theater, deported. They know. You go back to England and socialism, you can't take our guns. He gets so angry and just watch you do that. Well, he's so fun to watch and you see pierce like holding it down in very professional. He plays, he played them like a master. But when you don't understand is you can never win against Alex Jones because he will never feel ridiculous. Slight pierces trying to like embarrass him by being quiet while Alex Jones screams and yells, but then you just allow Alex Jones to go into full Alex Jones mode and then you're fucked because then you're dwarfed by his personality and he's saying Hilarious Shit. You know, he's talking to you in an English accent. You're not even addressed. Again. Cheerio old chap. Can't take all guns away and pierce is just peers. We'll have him back because he knows.

Speaker 1:          01:17:44       That's good. That's good tv. I'm sure he will have to. I'm sure he will have them back. So what else is going on here that they went from Larry King to that guy so fast. They had to do something. I guess we've had Larry on the show. He's awesome. He's elect Larry. He. He tells a good story. Still the smell. He looks like he would like antique bookstore or something. Yeah, he's. He's awesome. He has lots of great stories. You can have mine. He'll do it. Seemed like a real nice guy. I've done his show a couple times when he was on CNN a couple times for fear factor. Really. Was that intimidating? Being on CNN, it was weird because that's a big international audience. It was very friendly. He was very friendly. So no, that didn't bother me. No. You ever get nervous about people watching me on TV?

Speaker 1:          01:18:32       None of that show. I don't really know what you did between the UFC and fear factor and I've just done it so many times, especially the UFC, which is like, to me the like I owe those people that are fighting. I owe them my best performance more than anybody. Doesn't mean like the guy has a great fight and I don't do great commentary over his great fight. To me it doesn't feel like, you know, if I fail my, my side of the bargain, I, I feel very shitty. So have any of those guys ever taken a swing at you? For? Some dudes have been upset at me, but I've never been disrespectful in my depictions of like, I don't like in a weird way, it's brave because you're living. That's a crazy world to live in this crazy world and you're critiquing some of these guys.

Speaker 1:          01:19:20       I've always water men. I wonder if just one of those guys have taken a shot at it doesn't mean that they can't kick my ass, but it doesn't mean that I'm wrong. I know. I know what could make them better, you know, but they don't want to hear that. So that's why I wonder if they've ever taken it personally and by the way, they might not even be able to physically achieve what I'm asking them to do. Some guys that get into striking too late and uh, you know, you could say, well he needs to do is really go to a great striking camp and really get a striking together because he's missing this big hole. There were some guys athletically, I don't know what it is, but they know they can never really get the striking part downright. It's weird thing. It's like sometimes you see it in it's rare wrestlers who have been wrestling for a long time and um, for whatever reason they can't seem to get snap and their punches.

Speaker 1:          01:20:10       It's really weird. And there's some guys who have it like right away, like you, you start holding the pads for them and right away they're scary as fuck with their power. They're just super athletes. But some guys can't get that striking together. And I don't know what that is. I really don't understand it. I've seen it. I don't know if it's an age thing. I don't know if they caught it too late in life and they don't. They just cannot develop the kind of explosive that shit is obviously movement. Yeah. And when you see these guys okay. Yeah. Immediately. To me they look, they all look like they could strike. Well yeah. Well it's one of those things where if you, the more you appreciate martial arts, the more you understand martial arts, the in the more techniques that you know, the more you appreciate seeing the application of the techniques.

Speaker 1:          01:20:54       So like when people say like, you know why you getting so excited about it, you know, mma, why do you watch a Jujitsu matches and go crazy. Like why you get so excited about it? Because I know how hard it is to do with that guy's doing. I know it intimately, you know, so when you see a guy who's triangle and some guy and you hear me screaming, it's because this fucking dude just pulled off a crazy as triangle. It's hard to do. Right? So I am extra excited because I'm intimately aware of how difficult it is to do with this guy's trying to do. Oh, I love how you call fights. It's great. It's fun, man. It's, it's a fun Gig, right? That, that's, that's the only thing that I ever. I don't, I wouldn't say nervous. That's the only thing that I ever do.

Speaker 1:          01:21:31       I feel like my responsibility is more than just me. It's like the, the, the guys fighting as well. It's a sport to the fact that, you know, the fan base of millions of fans, you know, if I'm their favorite guy to do this, like I can't like slack off. They're like that, that I take like I take that super seriously. So if I ever do feel pressure it's then. But that pressure is good pressure, you know? But like as far as like doing this or doing Larry King or something like that, it was easy. Like I did TV yesterday. I'm doing a show for TVS. Who gets the last laugh? It's a passionate coachers company. Oh really? They're kind of reinventing punked. I did something with Ashton Kutcher's company. They were great people. I didn't meet, I didn't meet astrium but the people were awesome. I'm handsome men, so I'm in front of the line for features.

Speaker 1:          01:22:19       I'm in front of a live audience, you know, on a, on a stage, sort of. They're basically like, I directed a prank, kind of like what you've seen on, you know, on pumped and there's three of us and we all, uh, directed a prank and then we present it to a live studio audience. That's fucking horrifying for me. But I, but I could do radio, like, like, you know, I never get nervous doing radio. But you're also doing radio to your fans while. Yeah, I mean, first of all, they, they introduced me. No one knows who the fuck I am. Well you didn't stack the deck. What do you mean you didn't tell the ONA fans to get tickets? I should've. I know. Know keeps you. Shall throw that fucking phone in the toilet. You do that little bird that keeps going off for a couple minutes to burn. In a previous podcast we talked about

Speaker 4:          01:23:06       previous podcast. We were talking about how every time I'm at a restaurant that goes out, people are like, you just whistle at me with a little weird. I gotta be honest with you. Look, it's one of my guys. Great interview and Rogan asked to try his uh, uh, deprivation tank. Trippy. Trippy. I do want to try that. I want to float to do a. is there a place in New York where you could do it? I don't know. I gotta look it up. But anyway. Yeah, I need to open one. But it was horrified just presenting my stupid prank. So if you stack the deck with a ONA fans, I don't think you would have been. They were cool. There was no. Yeah, it was great. It was great because it was funny. But my point is I don't do a lot of tv, so when I do, it's like you want to talk about stepping out of your comfort zone.

Speaker 4:          01:23:45       Fuck yeah, that could fuck with you. That's like what? Like when you see those sportscaster guys that had been doing it like a million years and they were like, you know, like the nfl guys or any of these guys that had been, you know, they just so smooth and whatever they do, they've been there, done that. So it's all about doing the job. It's not about, oh shit, we're on TV. That's out the window now. It's just about being a job. Yeah. He used to be nervous doing radio. I mean, but that left years ago. So the only person who's ever intimidated me, it was a ray Liotta, diddy, intimidating, you know what it was about him. But he came in recently and I, I definitely did better. I just did better. He was one of these guys, man, I don't know what it is. I was fucking intimidating the first time he came in where I was barely talking and he finally looked at me and he goes, hey, is that guy sick, sick, sick.

Speaker 4:          01:24:39       I don't know what it was. It's like, no one else does that to me. But Ray Liotta and then the fans knew and then when know when he was coming back in, they were all talking about tweeting and you know, I did all right the second time. But he's a bad motherfucker. I don't know what it is. I guess respect for his acting funky. Goodfellas. Fuck you. Come on man. Did you ever see him in New York? He's in Narcan, right? No. To breathing. Yoda is a bad motherfucker was a bad ass. So I think it's him in the dark. You're gonna have to look that shit up. Okay. I have to go to the imd and see what's up. But uh, just his performance and goodfellows. I mean, to me it was so good the way he was keeping everything together, you know, running back and forth between the coke house, his girlfriend there and she throws a brick of coke.

Speaker 4:          01:25:26       Adam. It was just like when, when he was in the car and he was driving around the helicopters were over the head like you were there with him and kid and your high with them and I don't know what the fuck. Yeah, really owed. It was in that. I don't know what the fuck they did to his eyes and that scene. I mean maybe they kept him up and gave him coke because he looked like he was coked out. No, those are the eyes that that's what did it. Yeah. I was staring at his, at his eyes, you know, because when you're, you got guys in your interview and you got to look them right in the fucking eyes. And I was looking in his eyes. I'm like, fuck, that's fucking freaking me the fuck out. Freaking me out. That scene where his eyes were all fucked up and he was driving in the car.

Speaker 4:          01:26:05       I'm like, that guy. That's pretty much his eyes so well, but I'm telling you that it's pretty much his eyes in general. So you ever think about like a shit actor doing that same part. If you take some guy with an actor, of course can do that same part that him knowing where it really oded ever done it and this is difference and would we know, we would not know. Goodfellas is a good movie. Yeah. I wonder about that a lot. Like these bad fucking comedies that come out. You wonder if they got a different guy. Would that have changed everything? Yeah. If you got. You don't mean if you've got someone else to play this character. This movie could never been as good. Ray Liotta was born to play this cat. Sure, but it's not saying that someone couldn't have come up with something else.

Speaker 4:          01:26:48       Do you like caring about the actors that were also up for roles like that? That's always fascinating. Yeah. I don't have an example right now. Nobody could have done this. He was so fucking perfect with this. It was so perfect. What are you looking at it? Looking at? Look at sheer. There is that guys. There's a few of those guys out there that are like real craftsman. Like Daniel Day Lewis, really? Yoda, Russell Crowe. Before he got fat and lazy. We could still kick it out of the park, man. He wanted to. He's been gone a while now. Yeah. He needs a hit. Yeah. But it's, you know what it is. They keep the just get fucking crazy. It's nutty life to be a movie star out there. Jet Set in the globe trying to keep your shit together. Or would you like to do that? Fuck that. No.

Speaker 4:          01:27:32       Why not? Zero interest in making movies was because it's not fun. It's, it's thing you build up to a long point in time and then the fun things in the movie comes out. Yay. And then nobody likes it. But all that making of the movie shit. That shit takes forever. It takes forever. You're stuck in a time of. Yeah. No, nothing. Not really interested. I get it. I see how other people would like to do it. But to me I said it can be podcasting, you know, or I could be doing standup or I could be doing something else. Like why would I want to do that? I want to do that. She looks boring. My, uh, my latest thing is exploring the exploring New York City. Oh, really? Exploring. Did you ever see dark days where the bowl people used to live? Oh, dark days is a grit. Well, I shouldn't say it's a great document.

Speaker 4:          01:28:14       It's a weird document. It's a weird. It's a really cool documentary. It's black and white and basically it talks about the Amtrak tunnel under, uh, the upper west side. Uh, and you went down in there. Yeah, I've been wanting to do that forever because you worry about the super aids that are not super a pitcher. If you go that far to the middle of the earth, the fuck would happen. When did you do this post or Pre Sandy? Uh, after I only about a month ago. There's a guy coming on our show that, uh, I forgot the name of his book. Hidden cities of the world are under a fuck. You could probably look it up. His name's Moses because you have a TV show. No, but he's connected with a lot of those guys there. It's like a, it's like a network of guys and they go around the world like, Hey, you come to Paris, I'll show you our shit and then we'll come to New York.

Speaker 4:          01:28:58       You show us your shit. So you went with them. I went with this Guy Moses and we went into the, the old Amtrak tunnel and the train still run, but that's where the mole people used to live under riverside park on the upper west side and we went into a little fucking rat hole on the side of the highway and there was one holy wanted me to go through them. Like get the fuck out of here was just garbage and smell, like just horrendous. I go, let's see if there's another hole. And we went a little further and sure enough there was a whole just enough to get your fucking body in and then all of a sudden you're, you're under underground in this tunnel. Where were these people lived? Wow. Some of these people lived down there for like 20, 25 years. They kicked everybody out.

Speaker 4:          01:29:35       They kicked them out in, um, I don't know, like the mid nineties finally. How weird are people that they just find these little collective groups of other people willing to live in a tunnel and they find each other and they all live together. Yeah. I mean, a lot of them are drug addicts. How many down there? They don't really know. I mean, some say hundreds. Some say thousands. They don't really know. In dark days. They, the documentary, they didn't do a really good job because I would have loved to know that type of shit. They focused on, uh, probably uh, about a dozen people that were living down there. How would they built a little really nice fucking living arrangements for themselves down there. Like, really? Yeah man, like little shanty towns. But they had cable, they have electricity. They caught the TV, that TV they plugged into.

Speaker 4:          01:30:21       They figured out how to plug into everything. It was all free. They had pipes that they broke for their showers that was just constantly running cold water. They would take really ice cold showers. Really? Yeah. They had pets down there. When I went down there recently, it was me, this Guy Moses, and we saw three people the entire time we walked under ground two and a half miles to the way out. I mean when you commit you got to go the distance and it's two and a half miles to get the fuck out or he got to where are you going to come back from where you came from? Duke. And we only saw three other people and they were explorers to. So they were explorers as well. Yeah, checking, checking that shit out. So there's a lot of people that go on and explore it. I mean not a lot.

Speaker 4:          01:31:03       I mean that day there was what, five of us total. So there's. Yeah, that's not big for New York. Right. And it's a creepy thing to do though, isn't it kind of creepy man. It was cool though. But the relative to being in the woods, that stuff that used to be there, what they do with it all, they just pulled it all out of there and yeah, they cleaned it up yet because Amtrak had it and they. I guess I, I, I think that the tunnels weren't being used back then or they weren't being used a lot in Amtrak, one of their fucking tunnel back. So they kicked all the people out and they cleared, cleaned house, got all the Shit outta there, but there's beautiful artwork down their murals from these fucking, just literally underground artists, graffiti artists and shit off from the people that lived in there.

Speaker 4:          01:31:44       Pretty fucking cool stuff because the greats, you know, where people walk above obviously, uh, the light comes through right on the wall and every, every area that has the light coming down, someone drew something or painting something on the walls. Wow. And some of the shit is really fucking pretty, pretty good. That's such a trip. It's such a trip that they had developed like a little underground city down there. Fuck yeah. And a lot of these guys would come up during the day to, to hustle, you know, collect cans and, you know, make money, whatever they, however they could. Or they go through the garbage and get their fucking food and then they go back down. How long did this go on for? According to dark days, they were talking about guys that were down there for like two decades. Jesus Christ said fuck it to, you know, society to society and decide they want to live down there, but a lot of them were drug addicts and crack heads and shit list.

Speaker 4:          01:32:36       So many crazy. But it will in the world, in the movie a dark days. Some of the guys would write no crack on their little homes because they were sick of people, you know, breaking in or knocking, you know, asking for crack. So yeah, it's hard to get crack in the basement. It's the whole thing. So there you go. I keep forgetting that we could check some of this shit out. Yeah, it's so strange. I recommended. I mean, I, I think the, I think they could've done a better job with this documentary, but it was, it was definitely cool. Look, that guy has a dartboard. Yeah. He's got a frigerator behind him. Yeah. As a refrigerator. It's all, you know, free electricity and that's crazy. And so they just tapped into all the wires and everything. Yeah. Wow. It's really ingenious when it was so fascinating how people just find a way to adapt.

Speaker 4:          01:33:22       Right. You know, they find a way to adapt to living in Siberia. They find a way to adapt living in the fucking tunnels. Right. They seemed very, uh, very happy down there to that it becomes their life. Yeah. And I bet they probably feel like they're getting away with not paying rent. And of course it cripples everybody. Right. You're paying rent. I was creeped out. I thought I'd see rats down there. I didn't see any. And the guy, Moses I was with, he's like, look, there's no people down here anymore. And you know, rats need people to survive. So they go to the people that are it because rats basically just eat our garbage. I uh, was on the upper west side once and I was at a gas station somewhere on the west side and uh, I uh, was on the payphone and it's how long ago this was and was on the phone and my car was parked and was getting gas rats or jumping out of this sewer, climbing up my wheel and into the wheelhouse.

Speaker 4:          01:34:14       Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Just immediately, like, right away looking for like whatever fucking a sandwich. I might've run over and saw the tires. You're looking for a way into the car looking for a way like into the engine compartment. They sense the heat coming off of it. I mean, I saw six, seven rats climb all over my wheels. It was discussed and they're highly intelligent. There's so many. There's a book out there called rats. You want to be creeped out to. Highly intelligent. Yeah. They really are. And they learn and you know, it's really tough to fucking trap them and all that shit. Really. They understand when you're fucking up their environment. Oh yeah. That they, you know, they, they set up all their paths and stuff. So you know, dopey humans go, oh well I'll put the fucking rat trap right where their path is.

Speaker 4:          01:34:56       They. They understand that shit. They're fully aware. Yeah. Rat traps. Not enough of those cons. No. We've got to come up with robots at eat rats. They say there's more rats in New York City than people and they s in this book, they said at any given time, this is, this will blow your mind at any given time when you're walking around New York City, there's a rat within feet of you. Wow. Because they have all this, you know, these tunnels under the sidewalk and all that shit. So they dig their own tunnels under the sidewalk. Love fucking tunnels.

Speaker 4:          01:35:28       But according to this book, at any given moment in New York City or very close to a rat, wouldn't that be nice if they had an APP for that? So you'd go and you look at your phone like how many rats are near me? And you look in everywhere and your feet. It's like that scene in aliens when the little girl is hiding and the aliens are coming through the ceiling. You look all over the ground, it's like rats are underneath you and tunnels everywhere. I think people would move out. They wouldn't be so fucking comfy and cozy in their upper east side, you know, penthouses. If you could look down, you know, with a, with a phone and just see all the rats moving. I need to serve as you know, uh, the Plaza Hotel obviously in New York. Yeah, I think it was the daily news did an article about the park across the street is infested with rats.

Speaker 4:          01:36:10       And the reason is because the horse, the horse and carriages, you know, they put all the feed down so that shit is everywhere. So it's a great food source for rats. So I read about it in the, um, the paper. I went there that night and they said you got to wait til the sun goes down. And sure the fuck there were rats everywhere. Hopping across the fucking lawns and everything. Did you freak out? Sometimes they run like two feet. What? Fuck you. I don't know if it's because they're excited. I have no fucking idea. Not Not a lot, but enough to creep you out. Like what the fuck? Rats running. Oh yeah. And then there are people or people were just kind of sitting on benches and shit and rats were literally right behind them and they didn't know my because I was fully aware because the article somebody and they climb on people sometimes to just sit in there.

Speaker 4:          01:36:55       Any of that, but. But then you also see all the paths where the, where they're coming from. Yeah. Fuck paths from one bus to another. How many didn't think you saw that night? A couple of dozen probably. Oh yeah. They came out man. And that's probably a tiny fraction of how many of them are tiny little park. It's like, I dunno. Yeah, it's like maybe four times the space we're in right now. Let's see. Just a small part, but it was infested. Sure. The city hasn't cleaned it up since. So how do they do something like that? If you want. If you want to check out rats, go there. It's across the street from the plaza, not central park. Which is right there too. How do they keep a rat population? Correct. Does guys that make a shitload of money? Just killing rats. Killing rats.

Speaker 4:          01:37:35       I totally do. Yeah. These, these buildings, they. They hire the best guys and they make a fortune keeping these buildings red free. You need cats. Cats are the way to go. We, we cooked up rats on our radio show and you ate it. You didn't know about that one? No. Maybe we did more shit at new than satellite. Really? Yeah. One day we got the idea. I don't remember why. Maybe there's some dump cooking show on baby bird. The bird was the greatest fucking bit ever. Oh, and we got to talk about the destroyer before I get out of here. The nickname you gave me, right? You were there for probably the greatest bit we ever did. Baby Bird. But let me tell you about the rat thing real fast. So at new we decided to cook up rats and we actually got listeners to come in to eat rat.

Speaker 4:          01:38:22       Wow. And I looked at Anthony. I'm like, there's no way, but we'll try. So we, we, you know, we threw the question out there who would come in and eat rats, phones fucking lit up and people like Ali Rats. So we had two cooks come in. God, we had one guy that was a French chef and we had just a fucking run of the mill barbecue type guy and they, they both had live rats. We gave them the live rats and they had to do everything else. And one guy killed the rat, like very humane. He found a spot on the neck or whatever and just fucking stabbed the real fast. The thing was dead in a second, half a second and the other guy fucking took his bread was just bludgeoning to death on the side of the table. Oh my God killed him because he didn't know how else this is on the radio, on regular radio.

Speaker 4:          01:39:06       Oh my God. And then the French chef, uh, you know, had a nice recipe and he made like a, I remember this brown sauce and a nice feel like I was there, nice presentation and the other guy just fucking cooked up this bloody mess. Didn't even just cook the whole thing basically, but when you know, the listers came in and they tried the, the, the, especially the one by the French chef, they went back for seconds. It went back for seconds. Well, not only did they say the store ran or was it a street? Um, I don't, I don't remember where we got the restaurant and being completely honest with you. I was, we were trying to get like subway rats, but I think we might end up getting them from a pet store. So. But they were big ugly motherfucker things on youtube by the way.

Speaker 4:          01:39:52       It's under opion is probably full show rat eating, so. Oh yeah, check that out. Wow. But then you were there the first time we did radio together though, I think was in Vegas at the poker tournament. No, it wasn't in Vegas. It was out here. It was in California. Oh, and yeah, in California. Was that the first time you're on? Was Ed asner called you the destroyer? Well, yeah. But then he was at Asbury. But then you push that forward. Well, you, you came the first time we did the, did radio together. Uh, yes. Yeah, that is. I didn't, I didn't really. I knew of you and your standup obviously and like I said earlier, you know, you support us and we finally got to do radio together and Anthony was in the poker tournament. Yes. So I'm like, Yo Joe, you know, hang out, let's do this.

Speaker 4:          01:40:32       Yeah, we had a good time and asked her. Came on. I mean he had no reason to be on our show to be honest with you. He's a great guy. He just, he was all right. He's you and. And you started fucking with a full. No we didn't, we didn't, we got along. But uh, I, I had recently explained this a somewhere that um, I do that shit just to get a fucking. Get a rise out of someone out of you. Not. Yeah. I don't give a fuck about. So you, you went after him to get a rise out of them. That's how fucked up. That's fucked up and showmanship. I did it to superfly Jimmy snuck in the other day. Oh, did you really? Well, back in 83, a woman died that he was with and it was very suspicious, very suspicious. He says she fell on some rocks.

Speaker 4:          01:41:18       They were driving to a wrestling match or something and stopped at a rest area and she was checking out a stream and she fucking hit her head and then by the time we got into the hospital and stuff, she was dead. But some say, yeah, you might have had something to do with it. Maybe he didn't know. He imagine if that was actually just as girlfriend and you're accusing him of killing her and you know, we got a video, horrible and it's one of my latest videos on my youtube channel because what happened was I, we, we asked him the story which, which was pretty big because I wasn't sure he was going to talk about it and he told the whole fucking story and just to get a rise out. Everyone in the room. I go, well, what is she doing now? Knowing what, and look at the reaction I'm getting now, but that's just to get everyone in the room.

Speaker 4:          01:42:06       Extremely approachable. And that's what happened with asthma. It hasn't, it didn't do anything to me, but for the people that don't know, a producers started giving me hand signals and stuff like he was trying to get my attention for something else. It might even been where I was at in the poker tournament. And uh, who, who said, what does that mean? Was it you were at asthma owner about what would that hand signals that lead to what I did? I don't remember. Oh, okay. But anyway, like someone asks like, what? Why is that guy giving, you know, hand signals. And I said, well, when the guest is boring, I said this right as there I go with the guest is boring, they'd give me you hand signals to get them off the fucking air. And that's what they're called the destroyer. And for some reason that made you really happy.

Speaker 4:          01:42:51       It was hilarious. Made you really happy. It was fun because you were, you were fucking with them obviously, but it was good nature. It wasn't that. But you also got into a fight with a poker player that when we were there, you were there for me. You mean you're talking about d dot Grano? Yeah. Yeah. I didn't. I didn't really get into an argument. He just wrote some stuff on his blog. We weren't feeling them that day. We weren't feeling. Um, he, he's a good guy. Just he misunderstood what I was saying. He thought that I was talking shit about his ex girlfriend. I was not doing that. I was talking about like what? And he realized that he went back and looked at the listen to it and actually wrote an apology on his website. Oh really? He's a nice guy, you know, I got no problem with. We didn't, I don't know. I was doing radio. We were talking about. It was on Xm, so we were talking, we were having some fun. We're having fun. And then you were the one that officially came up with baby bird say is probably right up there. One of our greatest

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       beds, our, I think bill bird named it. It was, it might've been building. Said the name baby bird. Was it your ideas? My idea. I can't take credit for that one. My idea was, uh, we were doing the eggnog contest, which we no longer can do. It's illegal now. Fuck. Stupid lady died that drinking water? Yeah. We usually shut down spring pat from Iu knocky. They shut down to see what he. Were you there the year the guy ate the fruit loops with the puke milk? Yes. I saw Pat Duffy. What did he do with that day? I think pat. Yeah. Well I was there when he did it. He had pat dot because we brush his teeth with dog shit with cat shit. Shit, dog shit. He's fucking crazy. He's, he's on. He's on twitter. Just love Pat Duffy. I love him too. But whatever happened to him, how come he's not working for you guys?

Speaker 1:          01:44:39       Because we can't do the stunts anymore. But we got, we got a couple of positions that are open. So you know, he wants to interview for depressed the other day. It sounded so sad. So really. And he called in the Jim Martin show and he's just like, nothing's working for me. I'm on my last. It's him. He's willing to eat shit. He did amazing stuff for us, but he was the one that decided to go over the garbage pail when pat from Inaki Start puking from toe. We knew pat from when Daca was gonna Puke. So what we're trying to figure out what would be the most fucked up way to cap off this already awesome radio show. Which by the way, we're on regular radio. Okay. This was on regular radio, so we couldn't swear or anything like that and me from having doing fear factor.

Speaker 1:          01:45:21       It's the only way I would have ever thought to do this. I was like, how about someone leans over the garbage pail and he throws up in their mouth. I never thought anyone would say yes. Duffy's fucking stepped right up. And Pat Duffy stepped up immediately and I'm like, there's no way. This is really gonna happen. There's no way it's really going to happen. And the cartoonishness of the throw up coming out of path will knock you. The fact that it literally all Eggnog, yeah, it was 70 something shots of Eggnog and it was like a broken fire hydrants dream. It was the craziest thing I've ever seen in my life, the most amazing thing I've ever seen because you couldn't imagine there was that much fluid and one guy. It's just kept going and go in and go, and if you haven't seen it, ladies and gentlemen, you deserve to allow you to tow it.

Speaker 1:          01:46:09       Youtube took a lot of the, uh, videos down with that one. Well, this is from a cell phone. They let the cell phone version. This is all weekend long, is unbelievable. Pat Pat Duffy just sitting there with his arms crossed, relaxed and pat from Menarche, who is about what? 300 plus pounds, gigantic, tiny little thin legs and he's got this huge gut filled with eggnog and he's ready to blow it all over Pat's face. And once it goes by the way, the floor is covered with plastic set up like a texture cut room. They couldn't wait to get us out of there. They fucking hated it all I'm sure. Could you imagine? I didn't want to deal with these fucking jazz show

Speaker 4:          01:46:50       that's on and used that studio, so I haven't seen this in a while. Perhaps Munafiki. He said this is it. He's going, he's 75 position the cameras and everything. He's such a professional fine. People that call him from all over America. They've been puking all over the place. Every city in America. Yeah, because other people had already started hurling. They gave up early. It was you and Bill Burns studio that day.

Speaker 8:          01:47:20       Oh, there it is. That's happening. Is happening. Oh my God. That's massive. How big was that and you think there's no way. I have seen this video 100 times. It never gets dumpsters full. Seven, seven and he's not done

Speaker 9:          01:48:08       gallon each. How do you explain that? You can't explain, but how do you explain how much liquid is coming out of his mouth? There was a massive, but how do you explain that? Like they're massive blast of Linkedin, so why like rivers coming out of his mouth? You remember the Stephen King movie stand by me with a dude that has the pie eating contest. Bitch. Literally crazier than that. Oh yeah. Literally it doesn't believe. I don't believe that it came out of it.

Speaker 4:          01:48:39       Body Pat toffee. I didn't want. I did one study where we decided to make ice cream out of his sister's breast milk, so and I. every once in a while I'll step up and still do some of these fucking bits and that was one. For whatever reason I said, yeah, I'll fucking do it. Fuck it. And the ice cream, it tasted really good. He was a first second and then it was the most horrendous tastes you could ever imagine. This. The Pie eating contest where remember that? Oh yeah. I mean, here we are, right? Stephen King is such a bad motherfucker. How many good movies and books is this guy right here?

Speaker 9:          01:49:20       Yeah. Trashed us was covered by Pam was what was more impressive because that looks more fake. It did look fake. You tell them. You

Speaker 4:          01:49:31       guys. Yeah. I don't remember exactly. Somebody people. For what? Somebody put so many people trashed us. You forget. After a while, Steven went to them. I think we went after one of his radio stations or one of his morning show, the October sort of a thing. I think someone did. Someone maybe can help us out. Is He recently that did this? A couple of years back. Okay. Because recently you guys went after one in Maine. It was like a Portland, Maine when I was laughing my ass off. It was really funny. Yeah. The jock tobar ones are really. I loved those and I love how they always shut their facebook pages down, like almost immediately the past finding out about it. Just take that shit. But he can take, but they take it to the uh, the, the nth degree.

Speaker 4:          01:50:12       It's Larry. It's hilarious. Yeah. The past, uh, like the, the most loyal and active radio fans I think of any show. And they also turn on us as well. I keep us on our toes. Like, fuck. Yeah, they uh, they definitely do at the comedy shows. I know you guys had some. We, I went to one of your shows. I did one of your shows in Vegas and it was great. It was great. I know our audience has a, it has to be said. They are a great comedy crowd. They will sit down and fucking listen, man. Show in Philly the infamous show or that one they did was a hostile. Yeah, well they, they were drinking all day. We did these comedy shows across America and the Philly one is legendary now and I feel bad because I know you're close with dom rare, but he ate his balls that day, but I've thought about it many times to sap went on.

Speaker 4:          01:51:05       He never had a chance. He never had a chance to. Jimmy Schubert never had a chance. And Jimmy Schubert actually bombed in front of his fucking family that were basically sitting in the front row. They had to deal with that shit. Did Jimmy go on first? Uh, know Jimmy came close. I think, you know, I think he went, who didn't bomb? Um, Norton Bill Burr was next. Bill burr saw what was happening with Jimmy Schubert and then and then went on and shit. And he goes, you know what, they're fucking not doing this to me. And at that point, our audience didn't really know bill burr yet, you know, they didn't embrace him yet. Like other guys that came before bill, he was sort of on the cusp of being accepted by our big fucking lunatic, a audience. And he said, I ain't doing that shit to me. So legendary that, that, that clip is out there to.

Speaker 4:          01:51:54       We took on the intox fuck the liberty bell. Yeah. He went after Philadelphia in a way that nobody's ever done before. And, and he, uh, he, they started booing them. By the end of it, he got a standing ovation. It was one of the most amazing things I've ever seen. I know what I'm saying that a lot, but we're bringing up a lot of benchmarks today. But that was one of the most amazing things I've ever seen. A guy turn a fucking room like that. Yeah. That was legit. And that bothers me about this video. This, I wish we had a better copy of this. Yeah. It's just shitty cell phone video. It's somebody a uploaded on. No, no. Got It on their cell phone. Bill Berg started out in Boston and you deal with so many crowds like that drunk, angry, crazy fucks that you develop that style that, you know, that attack style that was a Boston

Speaker 1:          01:52:46       is Boston set tough for you guys? Boston's a great place, but every place to do stand up. Well as long as you got your shit together, but I mean when you're coming up, I would imagine it was hard. Well, when, when bill and I came up, I was a couple of years before him, but um, when we came up there was so many good comics around that, like the rules of the land had been pretty much established and there was a lot of really good places to do standing up. Right. But there was also like a lot of like really fucked up little shit holes that you get sent to Brazil. It's so important though. Of course, you know, you can't have like only easy crowds when you're starting out and really learn how to do comedy. You got to be able to do some hostile places. Right?

Speaker 1:          01:53:25       So I see like a guy like bill in that video, it's like, that's right up bills out. You get it, you do stand up in Boston, you're going to have to deal with it. You get it. I missed those shows. Were thinking about bringing them back. We'll send it back, man. It'd be fun. Maybe this coming summer we'll do one or two. You were the guy that need you first came up with the name desk squad. Do you understand that? That really, yeah. Our show or know the name desk was you came up with me personally or you did. You did. And he called his dad. He didn't make the name up but he called us. That's fine. You don't want to get a little credit here. Joe is going to be able to have credit. Man. When I showed up I showed up with tate.

Speaker 1:          01:54:03       Fletcher was his big giant ultimate fighter dude. And uh, Eddie Bravo. Sure. And you go, here comes Joe Rogan with the desk. Okay. I do remember that. And when you did that, that literally became the nickname. We started using it. So like all the podcasts that are called the desk, it all came out of that one thing. How do I get a little taste? What do you want? What do you want a hug? I got my money, I got my taste was out. The tastes of that. That's, it's tough to get that New York, New York, he gets got some wacky laws. You know, MMA is illegal in New York. No, I know. We can't even do a fuck when we talk about that with Dana white all the time. It's ridiculous what to do with fucking culinary union that they bind people off. It's amazing. It's amazing how it works.

Speaker 1:          01:54:48       But if you're talking about the amount of revenue that's being lost in the city, so why can they work around that knowing how much money they're losing because uh, the, the, the industry is set up where the influence of these unions, uh, is, uh, is really been established. And when they want to keep something out, they spend the money. They spent a lot of money on anti UFC propaganda, anti UFC websites. They put out, they put out press releases and can't make money off of say I don't, I don't understand. Here's the airstrip, break it down to the culinary union is in dispute with the owners of station casinos. Station casinos are a non union organization and apparently according to station casinos, the workers in the casinos voted to not go union. They don't want to be involved in human because they don't want to have to pay the dues and they believed that the company treats them fairly and pays them well. So since they don't want to be in the coroner union, apparently

Speaker 6:          01:55:44       this is allegedly. And you know, I don't really have any direct connection to any of this knowledge. This is a lot of hearsay. Hearsay. Allegedly. The Culinary Union would benefit in terms of millions and millions of dollars in dues if they got the station casinos because I think there's like 20 station casinos or something crazy like that. If they got those casinos unionized than it would be very financially beneficial for them. So they have a use lobbyists and they've used to politicians that they have relationships with and people that they can pay off to try to keep them in May, out of New York. Man, it's amazing. It's amazing because his millions of people in New York and it's a tiny handful of slots that are keeping them in Mayo and it's all financial and it's, it's made from New York City. Can you imagine? I don't want to talk out of school, so I don't know what the real details of their dispute or I don't want to pretend that, you know, just because I worked for the UFC that they're correct or anybody's career.

Speaker 6:          01:56:37       Sure. But it looks to me like some typical union goons, strong arm bullshit, you know, and that's a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm, I think unions are important. I'm a fan of unions. I'm a, I'm a fan of people getting paid well for, you know, for their efforts. And I think that there's a lot of merit in that, but when they do stupid shit like this, I think it ruins it for all the good benefits of the Union code. They started using themselves as a. they're like a mob of course, and they're trying to enforce their own interests and it has nothing to do with safety or nothing to do with the public. And to see these for horror politicians that have been bought off by these people, to see them lobbying to keep the UFC out. It's just discussed as standard. Getting closer. I think so.

Speaker 6:          01:57:17       I think it's A. There's Joe Rogan Madison Square Garden, Madison Square Garden calling a UFC fucking fight. Can you imagine? Yeah, I could imagine it. That'll fuck it. Freaked out a little bit. No. Madison Square Garden now I wouldn't know. I found from the casino that when you guys were all there, it wouldn't. It wouldn't shake me because it's a historic building, but it's at the end of the day, it's just a building that's true. You know, at this, I mean maybe five years ago would have freaked me out, or 10 years. Is that as. Look how young you are, Brian. He's a little sweetie. Oh, that's hilarious. Where is it? Where are these pictures from? A. This is from that casino. What side of the, uh, this is one of my private sites. Well fuck man. And I can send them to you. So my pictures way back in the day. Wow. What year was that? Like 2006.

Speaker 6:          01:58:07       Was it even. When were you guys, when did you guys first get on his, this guy? Two thousand four. I don't know. I know who that is. He wants to take a guess. Some famous. Very famous. Was that Michael Clarke? Duncan. You were looking at a very famous athlete. She said it's Michael Clarke Duncan. Well, I can't see it that good. He's making a crazy face. We're looking at a very famous. It was his name. T Dot Deacon Jones. Oh, Deacon Jones. Who was on? I think this is 2000 format to them for. I think we just got on. When did you start working with me? I'm 11 years ago, 10 years ago, so 2002 while we went to sell it. Yeah, it was 2004, 2004. It was like right after you guys went to satellite. Yeah. We're just starting to get back and shit. Fuck. Here's the table. Funny.

Speaker 6:          01:58:58       Yeah, look at that. Vos Vos was their boss was there, so it was me, you, Vasa, Jimmy, and it was playing poker that day and then Ed Asner, Steve and I did that just for you fucking guys because he didn't deserve it that day. Boy. I listened to Vossa and body and Bonnie's a podcast the other night driving home. It was on your station. Wanted to fucking throw myself out of the vehicle. I'm really did hit the gas and kick that door. Open leap. I don't know if you know what I'm saying. Is there conflict? Their concept back and forth conflict. It's really fun. I love it. It's really fun. I really love listening to those two. The main sheet tortures him and she does and you know what? She's smarter than him and that's a bit. That's a little bit. Now Richard's going fucking text me. She's smarter than him and they're in a trap.

Speaker 6:          01:59:47       You know, she's, she's got them locked up. Whenever they start going, they banter back and forth. She's always right. He never went to one fucking trumping them over and over again. And I'm listening to it. I'm like, I'm going to open this door and I'm going to jump this fucking car for rich. This is brutal. It's one of the few podcasts I do listen to. Yeah. What, what, um, what do you have on your show now? You and your channel and the weekends. You have our show, our show, the, we call it friends of the show. It's your friends with Charlotte's. We call them a Richard Bonnie. Um, I think bobby's podcasts out there. I Dunno. We mix and match every weekend. So.

Speaker 6:          02:00:32       And it's on Saturday and Sunday. Is that what it is to leave? So I don't listen to my channel. So you guys don't, you don't control when your show goes on because look, I love Ron Fez. Yeah. But I don't like the fact that when I get up in the morning and from driving around at 9:00 in the morning, I don't hear you guys doing your show. I hear Ron and Fez. Well you've got to get the on demand thing. Yeah. Yeah. But when I'm driving, I'm driving pretty fucking pot. And if what it does is it connects to your internet and then you could just show, it sounds like a fake person. You could choose. We had every episode you want and you could download tomorrow or yesterday's and hit play and it automatically play. So it's kind of like itunes for Sirius Xm. Okay. But can I listen to it today? Yeah. Yeah, super fast. I would love for our show to beyond, of course, you know, in the morning drive. So the archives right away, I would love to have better, but do have to have a three g connection or some sort of a connection to pick it up. You always have that connection you usually. But yeah, you have to have some kind of connection, some kind of connection. I don't like your voice because the satellite, I don't have to have a connection because I'm connected to the motherfucking sky. Bridges. Storms. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:01:40       Bridges, storms or clouds. Snow fucks it up as well. That sure enough, you ever get like direct TV snows out fucking worse. Good luck. Why then you wish you had cable and you pissed. I don't know if I like the pure coconut water. You guys got a lot of freaky stuff around here. Coconut water. It's very freaky. I'm surprised it's a brain. You're talking about. How's coconut water? Freaky, freaky, freaky shit. I guess maybe I'm not describing it perfectly, but you got a new mood thing over there. You got fucking Alpha brain over here with freaky PPO. I'm drinking pure coconut water. It's very good for you. Which I know is very good, but I don't. I don't. I don't know. I don't like it was surrounding you with like organic items. Wood and brick and and coffee made with butter it together, Bro. Coffee made with butter.

Speaker 4:          02:02:28       It's bulletproof coffee. It's fed butter. I know it's one of your sponsors. Mycotoxin free coffee. I say that with love. I know, I know. It's not even one of my sponsors. I think I've heard you talk about it. We sell it on on it, but they're not a sponsor on. It's one of our sponsors. We started selling bulletproof coffee because it's so good that the key is trying to find coffee. That's like. It has very little mold in it. You remember? You can treat it too with coconut oil. You ever have this starbucks coffee where it's like the fucking really good shit. Only a few starbucks a it. What is it? It's Kinda like um, what I remember they have a. I think you even told me about this, that some starbucks have this million dollar coffee maker machine. Yeah. The others are machine guy made the. He was a coffee freak and he made this machine that bruise the beans to the perfect temperature and all that shit.

Speaker 4:          02:03:20       Starbucks experimenting with that in Boston. You get a cup of coffee? I actually had it on a. What is it? Boylston street again? Yeah. Is it Boylston? Down Boylston. Boston. Is that where the finish line for the marathon is? What road is that? I don't know, I, my roads fucked up. I'm not a little man. It goes around and running. No, he never ran. I do run, but I'm not to race. Let's see. Who actually was. I was just teasing. I was good. Nothing wrong with running. Anyway. They were running 20 miles without stopping. No, let's do that. Why would I do that? Just get in the car just so he could say that this year. But there's a starbucks over there in Boston and it's like seven or eight bucks for one cup of coffee. So I had to try it. It was amazing. Is it the type of bean as wells as special, like fucking blue or green something. Fucking coffee beans. And they brew individual cups of coffee and it takes a whole thing and it's like Kinda, it's almost like a pizza pie tray and it's a, it's a whole thing. Your watch it being made the most expensive coffee or drinking something called Kopi Luwak. No idea what it is. It's um, it's coffee beans that are eaten by an animal called a civet right. And it shits it out and when it hits it out, the coffee beans are not digested by its body, but

Speaker 6:          02:04:38       it's bodies, acids, stomach acid, do something to break down the outer area, that outer heart area. And then when you brew those beans it's unbelievably smooth and delicious. And it doesn't taste like shit. Someone has to say it. Sorry. No, I guess they clean it. Just fucking drain the beans a little bit. They cleaned the shit. I try that. It's good. I'm telling you it's delicious. Where he gets a different. You're going to specialty stores to get an order online. But the fact that someone likes coffee so much, they picked it out. A pilot shit. No kidding. This little cunty fucking civic. And you know, they had been. Someone had to try it for the first time. Yeah, we'll think about it. Anything that people have eaten yet? We've, we've lobsters and shit. Someone had to go, you know, I think that might be tasty.

Speaker 6:          02:05:21       They had to give it a shot and they. But I think at this stuff they, they tried like, you know, someone had to try poison ivy. Yeah. Oh yeah, but the eight that they had to try all that shit. Then we finally said, no, leave that shit alone. Yeah. It's funny how some plants are delicious for you and other plants will kill you immediately and they all like sorta had someone had a fucking figure that shit out for us that they've all been documented. It's essentially into. Except for like the rain forest, there's they don't know what the fuck's in there and you deal with like the gigantic vast reaches of the Amazon and how many plants are in there that we don't even know about this. It's very possible they send botness down there all the time and they discover new shit and we're just fucking destroying.

Speaker 6:          02:06:06       Tell us it's no big fucking deal. Well, the. Where's it Borneo? Was it born here? They keep finding new species. They've been funding a bunch of new species and then like tropical rain forest, new species of primates, new species of bugs and these species of birds. It's like they're constantly finding all these weird freaky fucking animals they didn't even know existed and it's 2013. We do not have a good inventory of all the life on earth. We got most of it though. Not Big. Todd. Todd. I don't know. What about lochness monster? I think that's most likely horseshit or it could be a just a big fish or an eagle has to be you. Now they've been. They've been looking around enough. Well then that didn't know. Just look around enough. They've actually trolled the sonars know that and they thought it was a place.

Speaker 6:          02:06:55       Yes. Or I think, but if I'm not mistaken, I don't think that animal breeze water. I think that animal is supposed to be an air breathing thing. Like a whale, you know, that kind of situation. Yeah. And it's like. I don't know though, I don't know if they do, they breathe the water, but I just don't think that a dinosaur could be alive today. It just doesn't make sense to me. But how cool would that be? It would be pretty fucking cool. That'd be cool. Right. You think will bring dinosaurs back? Yeah, I think they're going to do that eventually. We're going to start doing some of that shit. I couldn't imagine them not because they're already talking about mammoth. I think there's some Russian. They're getting close scientists figuring that out. I just think either they're very close to, but they've only been extinct.

Speaker 6:          02:07:33       How many years? 13,000. I was going to say somewhere in the pleistocene. Somewhere around the. That's nothing compared to fucking dinosaurs. Yeah. They don't know. Uh, they, they think that they might have been killed the same way they think that a lot of speculation as to what killed off the woolly mammoth, but they think the woolly mammoth and the tooth tiger might've been killed off by meteors. Really? Yeah. They think that, um, the, uh, the decline of the last ice age, like the abruptness might've might've been started or triggered initially by meteor showers because they found that about, I think 12,000 years ago. And the Strada, when they do like coil soil samples, you know, 12,000 years ago they found this type of glass that exists at nuclear test sites in on meteor impact sites. And it's everywhere all over the earth. So they, they found in all sorts of different countries and it's all in the same area, so they're pretty sure that that's what happened and they think that that might've coincided with a lot of mass extinctions, including like the wooly mammoths and saber tooth tigers because they found, they found some areas really interesting areas where they found like a lot of bullying, mammoth skeletons all together in one place.

Speaker 6:          02:08:40       Like they all died together. I don't know, you know, I tell what kind of classes that they're fighting impact glass. It's like, what does it look like? It's like greenish. It's really kind of, what is it, like big huge pieces. I don't think it's microscopic the scopic unless, I mean, I don't want to say microscopic, it's the wrong word. I think it's, it varies in size, but some of it is small pieces that they just find that's pretty cool in the uh, well let me, let me find it like, so I can answer your question, but impact glass glass 12,000 years. Um, yeah. It's fascinating shit because what they're saying essentially is that it's most likely that if something like that did happen, a lot of people died and then it might've killed off a huge percentage of our population, but it's so long ago that the stories about it, that the fables, everything that was if there was writing back then everything that was written down, it's gone.

Speaker 6:          02:09:32       It's long gone and it's my. It might be very well that the amount of civilization that we had back then was like we were on our way to developing a civilization, but it's pretty remote and pre pretty crude and then it got reset and then we had to start all over again. You think it was crude? Might be if there's a lot of highly intelligent beings before us. Sure. It's possible. It's just as no evidence of it. True. What? What have you found new evidence somewhere and you found out? Well in Greenland, there's an alien ship that came here from another fucking planet. They found it in the ground and they found all this alien fossils and they had a whole city set up here. One hundred million years ago, you'd be like, Whoa, no shit. You would. Yeah, I mean, but until they find something like that, you just talking to your ass, you know.

Speaker 6:          02:10:15       Well, that's what I said about bigfoot. Said that about bigfoot. Right? You're right. Except I defer to that lady that, uh, that late. Yeah, she knows a little bit more Jane Goodall's. She's a bad bitch. She knows what the fuck she's talking about. But then again, that could be just her super excited. The melt glass at 1700 degrees equal to an atomic bomb. Meteorites are thought to have triggered, triggered a cold snap that killed off every civil early civilization and giant animals. Yeah. This is what they're thinking. Evidence of this media rights, intense heat was found on two continents. Researchers believed the huge, huge cosmic impact triggered a vicious cold snap which caused widespread destruction. The international team found a substance known as melt glass, which forms the temperatures of 17 whoa.

Speaker 6:          02:11:02       Seventeen to 100 degrees to 2,200 degrees Celsius and can result in a cosmic body hitting the earth. So that's what it's is a result from. So they think that that's like one of the leading. Oh, it's big man. They have big pieces of the shit. I thought it was small, but look, it's big. It's in this case, it doesn't look like glass though. Yeah, it's weird. It's created by it. Well, it does here more. It looks like, like melted glass right out. You can just looking at sort of a weird picture. But um, there's a, there's a thing called the clovis comment and uh, that's uh, uh,

Speaker 6:          02:11:44       a comment that they're, uh, an impact site that they, they were uh, researching too. They're trying to figure out is around the same, same time around 12,000 years ago. They think that uh, that might've coincided with a lot of the or might have rather been the source of a lot of the stories of cataclysms and like the old texts, like the Sumerian texts and you know, in the ancient stories from the original Hebrew Bible, like a lot of those cataclysmic stories might've had something to do with it. Retelling of the days of the impacts of the meaning, the showers. Were you bored in school? Yeah, I was pretty bored. Yeah, because they weren't teaching this shit. Well, they were, you know, the problem with school is they're just trying to get you to conform to sitting in a chair and absorbing information, doing what they asked you to do, all that, you know, when you're, you got a kid. The way to get a kid excited about learning is to get them excited about learning something that he's interested in of course. And then once they do that. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          02:12:44       And then once you do that then you know, learning becomes fun for most of us. Learning became a bore, a burden. It's A. Yeah. So I had to kind of relearn what learning meant. Now, how you handle that with your kids? In what way? How were they learning? Just traditional school. Yeah. Um, but, uh, I mean, are they having a good time with it or are they going through the same shit we did growing up because my kids are still too young. They're the start that next year. I guess the, the, the four year old is in preschool right now and it's fascinating to watch them first start to interact with their little friends and they're just starting to learn things and they're learning things and it's fun. And what's really interesting to me is I was watching the other day and they're teaching this class and you know, they're, they're teaching them stuff and they get excited when they raise their hand and they

Speaker 1:          02:13:31       figured out and they're right and they all like laughing and having fun. I'm a lot happens where this stops being fun. Like how does this become the gross snus that is nonchalant high school teachers who don't give a fuck and kids in the class. I don't give a fuck and everybody seems to be misguided and lost and ready to fucking just get out of there and break free. I got to answer the first, the first day they gave you homework. I said it though, I don't think you should do homework. I agree with you. Well, school was absolutely fun until they started fucking giving you homework and if and, and it was busy work. Most of that shit was busy work and if it did, it looked, you know, only you can only focus on certain, you know, like one thing or whatever. Whatever your, your subjects already, you're really trying to gather information on.

Speaker 1:          02:14:22       You can only focus on them for a certain amount of amount of hours in the death course. Otherwise you're going to lose the absorption and when you force kids into like getting home and then working out what about the rest of their life, you're going to make an imbalanced person, right? If you're going to school eight hours a day after that, that should be good enough. Should be an eight hours doing anything a day should be good enough. It's ridiculous. You're not going to get it. I'm going to handle that. My son is almost three at preschool next year in the fall and I don't know. I don't. I don't know how. What are your thoughts on the way to, you know, I mean obviously you made a living in a very controversial and I'm a unusual way by, by becoming a radio guy, like very few people make it as a radio guy, so like mean a lot of parents, they're big scare.

Speaker 1:          02:15:11       The big fear is what if my son or daughter becomes a loser? Right? What if I fail to get them ready for the real world? And then they're out there and they become like this big burden. So then when they hear something like, hey mom, I want to be a radio DJ. No son, don't, you know, it's hard to make it in the radio business. The retail business has one of the smallest rates of success of any business in America. Why? Why do that? Or do you go work with your funder and stocks and bonds and mom, my dad said, go for it. Well then your dad's a good guy. He was an amazing guy. Yeah, he absolutely. He told me from a very young age, he said, look, find something you really enjoy because you're gonna. Have to do it for a long fucking time.

Speaker 1:          02:15:48       He didn't give a fuck if he wore a suit or if we, you know, try to be a radio guy. And he supported me. He supported me every step of the way. That's awesome. And it's funny you say what you just did because I remember my friends were so fucking jealous of me because I was able to go for my dream and they want to go for the same fucking dream, but they had the parents that you just marked where they basically said there was like five careers that were the hot careers back then and they've basically forced their kids to go to college to get a job with one of those areas. Yeah. It was the safest route. And those, those guys, they're miserable. They're absolutely miserable. Yeah. And then you're fucked because stuck on that path. There's nothing he could do. You get the mortgage, you got the wife, you've got the kids, you've got the job.

Speaker 1:          02:16:34       That's a good job. Like what are you gonna quit this good job and then how are you going to live? We're going to do. You're going to be a musician now. Really not your time to be a musician was when you were 20. And to be fair, my dad always said have something to fall back on. Like he was aware that the odds were against me, but he's like, you know, make sure that you have something to fall back on. Which I never really did. I just Kinda, I was either going to do that and just be a bomb or something I think. But as far as my kid goes, I just want him to just try every. Everything, whatever he enjoys. Right. Pursuing enjoys. I always say that if there's a guy out there, anybody out there that's making comic books, you can make comic books too.

Speaker 1:          02:17:11       Okay. If there's a guy out there who's making movies you can make movies to. You're a person. You've got to figure out what he's doing. I'm not saying you're going to figure it out. You might not be able to figure it out, but if it was so easy to do, everybody be doing it. Okay, but if someone's doing it, it can be done, right? It doesn't. You know, you have to figure out and along the way you learned about yourself and you learn about getting shit done. You learned about making things happen. Of course, that's what people don't learn when they take the safe route and they save the take that safe route, they, they don't learn about making shit happen. It'll learn about the thrill of carving a life out of something that's like a really difficult business like the radio business, like you've got to kick back at the end of the day and go, hey, fuck it.

Speaker 1:          02:17:50       I'm opie from opie and Anthony. It's one of the biggest radio teams in the history of the business. A 10 year period. At the end of the day, there's no one can take that away. That's pretty fucked up. It's fucking awesome. That's the only thing I've done in my whole life, but it's good. Eighteen years old, but it's great. And to think about how few of them, how few people who get into radio ever get to be an opening and a few people get to be on a show like opie and Anthony, a few, and they were scared to take the chance. So you can understand why your parents would be reluctant to try to encourage you to do that kind of a dream. If you don't want your kid to be a loser and you see something like radio, you're like, ah, it's fucking kid. I wonder what. I wonder what they really thought were they weren't talking to me when I was away doing this fucking thing.

Speaker 1:          02:18:32       I wonder if they, you know, I wonder if they had conversations like, oh fuck, I hope he gives up on that. You know, fortunately one of these days, my parents didn't have any influence on me by the time I was 21. There's nothing they could say. I was so stubborn like I have. When I had it in my mind, I was like, it didn't matter to me. So when I started doing standup comedy, my mother was like, wow, I never really thought you were that funny. I don't think. Yeah, my mom didn't think I was funny at all. I think, uh, I, I never looked back at 18. Oh yeah. Yeah. I, I came from a, you know, kind of a strange upbringing. My mom was fucking mentally insane and I knew I had to get the fuck out of there. So when all those stories about your dad and the gambling, gambling, you know. Fuck. Was that, I don't know. No, no, no. My Dad wasn't a gambler. No, I'm sorry, I confused you with somebody else. Who the fuck that I confuse you with?

Speaker 10:         02:19:20       Oh no, that sounds like a good story. Shit.

Speaker 1:          02:19:25       God dammit. All right, forget it. So

Speaker 4:          02:19:28       now I need to know your mom was nutty. Oh yeah. Yeah. Do you feel like you have any of that nutty sauce working around your brain? I'm sure we all do. Not like, not like she had. No. She had, she was dying. She diagnosed with OCD, but she's scared all sorts of shit going on now. What would they do for it today? If it went today? They would hook her on Medicaid. Yeah, but I mean the pills that come a long way, you know, but back in the day, man. Holy Fuck. Yeah. If you were stuck, if your mother had a mental illness back in the day, nobody did anything about it. They're not. They didn't have any results. She went away. She would go away to mental hospitals and as kids we were like, where's mom? Oh, she's visiting like a long lost fucking relative. Oh, she would be gone for a week or two at a time.

Speaker 4:          02:20:11       Yeah. And they did. They did the electric shock treatment back then, the bad kind a, they've been able to pinpoint that shit. So when they do give you, let's recap, now they, they kinda, they understand a little better, but back then they were just frying the whole fucking brand and hoping they returning some shit off. Oh yeah. What's really interesting when you look at like respected peer reviewed medical journals from like the 16 hundreds and shed thought you could love bottom eyes people. Totally cool thing to do. Man. I don't know what year it was where they lobotomized people, but I'm making the number up, but whenever they used to do it, like you know, they thought that was the way to do it. Right? Like this is a good middle of fucking stick in there and scrambling, put some day they're going to look at the shit we're doing today and going into these idiots back then thought this was the right thing.

Speaker 4:          02:20:59       Oh yeah. Like, you know, artificial hips, artificial hips tweaked me out. Like I can see when someone needs them and you know, you gotta do what you gotTa do, but I know in a few years they're going to be able to regenerate a hip. Of course they're going to be able to figure out to do some really nutty shit. They built a woman's bladder. They made a fake bladder. Yeah. They built it in a fucking. I Dunno how it built it, right? Do you use some sort of tissue from her skin and constructed a bladder one and then put it in her body didn't work. I don't know. This is a test. Her urine.

Speaker 4:          02:21:32       I don't drink other people's urine, just my own. I don't even drink my own anymore. I tried it a few times. I tried. It's not that bad. It wasn't bad. Yeah, it was. Yeah. It's one of those things where you can survive on a boat if you drink your urine or you could die of dehydration. Let's see. Fucking pussy. You know what I'm saying? I hear you saying that as a father you'd be able to kill a deer if your kids were hungry and you knew that's what you had to do. Brewer. Brewer told me the greatest thing about being a father when he goes, when you become a father, you completely understand that you could kill another human being. Oh yeah. I didn't understand that. My wife was pregnant at the time and I was hanging out with her and you know, you get all this advice from all your friends and that's what he told me.

Speaker 4:          02:22:17       Had Boys at the fucking truth, man. Oh, it's totally. Yeah. I'm a lunatic father at the playgrounds. Are you? You a little kid watching my son's coming down the slide. Oh No, not that bad, but there was a, there was a girl that pushed my son right into a pole bad and I had a little girl. My Shit. Well she was bigger than my son, but still, what, three or four? He was probably a year and a half at the time was a little girl, uh, a yelled in, like, just like in general, but the kid was pretty damn scared out of my mind because the parent wasn't around. I was like, who's I started screaming, starts screaming, who's fucking kid is fine because my kid is like, you know, when you see your kid cry, it's brutal, right? Yeah. It's pretty brutal. I mean, you know, I've learned since then you've got to be a little cooler about it.

Speaker 4:          02:23:04       But I lost my fucking, my shit because she went right at him, you know, he was being an innocent little kid. Just kind of like shadow playing with them and following them around. She turned around and gave him a shove. He went flying to this poll. I thought he was fucked up to say that most kids that do that, like physical kind of stuff, it's because that's happening to them. Uh, no. Yeah. Well we all know kids are sponges, right? Yeah. They say when kids react violently, like out of, out of sort like that. I kind of believe that. Yeah. I noticed the most kids are passive aggressive assholes. You go to the playground with your kids. Oh yeah. How do you handle it? I just let him play. And you let him get like thrown out. I have a two and a half year old and I have a four and a half year old, so four and a half year old.

Speaker 4:          02:23:47       I've watched her lose a little bit more distance, but the two and a half year old I mirrored her. I'm there. I'm her shadow wherever she goes. No, I let I let my kid get roughed up a little bit, but not that, you know, being pushed into. Well, it just doesn't seem very necessary. Yeah, I would definitely say something, but it wasn't really badly hurt. Yeah. I'm trying not to scream, you know, but it's hard when you're even embarrassed. I lost it and then some parents came up, but it wasn't her kid. It was like a friend of the, of the parent that was watching the kid and she's trying to go at me and I'm like, look, you don't even know what the fuck she did. Was she saying because I'm yelling, so she thinks I'm yelling at her kid. I'm like, I'm technically not yelling at your kid.

Speaker 4:          02:24:28       Um, I am losing it because as you see, my kid is screaming over here and yeah. And I, and I go, you don't even know what the fuck happened? I said, fuck right. I go, well, do you were, were you, you weren't watching your kid. Uh, yeah. People get real defensive. It's very emotional when you're dealing with children and injuries and shit. And when you, um, when you like see how fucking wacky the world is getting, do you worry about the future? Each other fucking mean you guys as part of your show, you're constantly covering everything that's fucked up about the world and this constant stories. And it's brutal. Yeah. I, I kinda liked the days where I just had to worry about myself. Yeah. I also, I also know that I will absolutely take one before my kid does. Right. I know I will jump in front of a car and all that shit now. Well obviously, yeah, that we hope it doesn't. Course

Speaker 1:          02:25:24       I did all that shit, you know, plays into it being a father. You're like, oh my God, this is all stuff I've never had to think about or worry about. This world is beautiful in certain spots for certain amounts of time. And the key is trying to take those certain spots where it's beautiful for certain amounts of time, extended amount of time and spread out the spots. Nice. You know that that really is. I mean, think about obviously we all like people, right? And we all love people. We all love people. You know, there's, we all have really good friends. We all have family, we all have people that we enjoy seeing in movies. The key is to bring everybody else into that, like sort of a, an environment like this. This idea that we need constant conflict, I think that's all, some outdated ape shit and I think that that needs to be looked over and move forward and it can be managed and done with conflict.

Speaker 1:          02:26:14       Yeah. It's so stupid after awhile. I mean the, the fact that every fucking day in the news we're talking about going into some new country and there's some new, uh, al Qaeda strong point. Did you hear about that shit? This is some new talking point. Oh really? Oh yeah. They'll have an island and like Malley, there's some place called molly. Where's molly? Do you know where Melia? Brian, anyone? Malley Malley. Google manage silly goose. It's mally mal. I. So this is the. Somebody sent me this tweet, I don't know how correct he as he says, al Qaeda moves to mally. Just so happens molly has gold and mineral deposits of course. Oops. Which is hilarious. So, uh, out in the headline in the world, news on Yahoo is al Qaeda carves out own country in Mali that al Qaeda has its own country. All of a sudden, all of a sudden, deep inside caves and remote desert basis, it sounds like you're reading something from the fucking 19 fifties.

Speaker 1:          02:27:14       When it was propaganda films, he'd been sad. This is how it actually starts on Yahoo knows yahoo news deep inside caves and remote desert basis in the scarp mints. It's an escarpment. The escarpments and cliff faces of northern Mallee, Islamic extremist fighters have been burrowing into the earth erecting a formidable set of defenses to protect what is essentially become our titus newest country. Africa. They got, they got a layer that is, it sounds like they're living in the middle of a mountain that is Wacko propaganda. When did that, a couple of days ago? Um, I think it's today. I think it's Today's news I haven't really checked into 10 hours ago apparently. I mean, I don't know if that's true. Maybe it is true. Maybe there really isn't. Al Qaeda has a fucking country all of a sudden there. You know, I haven't, I haven't turned on CNN, Fox, MSNBC, and like two or three days.

Speaker 1:          02:28:08       It's kind of Nice. It seems like the government wrote that though, I can't believe that a journalist wrote that the way this is written, it's almost like the government said, here go like this. It's almost like the government hired some gay guy hiding from the fact that he's gay and he's very creative and he writes and he has a boyfriend, but no one can know, and so he writes this kind of shit for them. They pull him aside and say, listen, we need something that really gets people excited about us going over to molly and taken over that gold, so do what you gotta do and you have a fancy little typewriter and say hi to your boyfriend for me in this gay dudes sweating it out, drinking bourbon. Lincoln is glass together. This is what one side King Center imagination you got in the escarpments carpets. Escarpments is this phrase only a gay man uses only a gay man under the influence of alcohol is trying to come off as being a little bit more literate and verbose in his scarp mints and cliff faces, northern Mallee, Islamic extremist fighters, Islamic extremists fighter. That's Kinda scary. I've been barreling into the earth. You have a picture of these fucking people. Please. Can I at least see one of them satellite photos? Do you ever leak

Speaker 6:          02:29:20       a leak in what? I got to take it. A leak. Oh yeah. Go take a leak, man. Go ahead. I can handle it. I have a fucking powerful bladder

Speaker 1:          02:29:27       drinking coffee the whole fucking time. Like I told you. Oh, I got a powerful bladder. How much time do we have left on this program? It's like not even 5:00. Twenty minutes. We almost did three hours. Ope already. That's pretty good. Crazy. I think. I think we did good. Then you want to wrap it up right now? No, I don't care. You go take a leak and then come back. We'll talk about some other shit.

Speaker 6:          02:29:48       Opie took notes. It's a fucking goddamn professional. He knows what he's doing. It's the most professional out of all the radio guys we've ever had on the show. One of the radio guys we had on the show, so Norton Norton's comic as well. We need to get tom like on. I know Kevin Smith back on. Yeah, we need to get to, I got to do his show next. I owe him one, but then he'll do ours, but we have to do it that way because I did him first and then he did us. That's why I'm io, but I'll do it and then a, they'll do us again.

Speaker 7:          02:30:17       Hm.

Speaker 6:          02:30:19       It's a big swap off.

Speaker 6:          02:30:22       But uh, we got a lot of good guys coming up. We're going to do what David Cho with, uh, with Yoshi. He's coming up soon. We got a Dunkin, most likely it's going to be here tomorrow, but a Dunkin is undergoing a, his first doses of chemo, so. Oh No. Yeah. So He's, he's very optimistic though. The type of cancer that he had his papers to the trouble. Yeah. Yeah. He has to do a, a version of it. I don't know exactly how it works. He'll uh, he'll explain it to us because it's pretty interesting. Like he was, he was explaining to me on the phone today they, uh, this particular type of cancer, testicular cancer, a lot of research has been done and apparently they're very good at nabbing it, stopping it. And a very good at, you know, bringing people back to being cancer free. Scary Shit though. Scary Shit. When a friend has something like that,

Speaker 1:          02:31:16       you should check out the movie 50 slash 50. It deals with seth and then

Speaker 3:          02:31:20       the guy from looper and stuff and I just watched it the other day. It's on Netflix and it was kind of interesting to watch, you know, like a young kid getting this cancer and having to do like the cancer, stuff like that.

Speaker 1:          02:31:31       I went on a date with a girl once she. She died of cancer when I wanted a day with her. She was already suffering from cancer. When my friend hooked us up together, we went on like this double date. She was very nice, very nice. She had something like, I think she had her lymph nodes already removed. She had some, some, some issue like her neck had like a scar on it and she wore a scar to cover up this a scarf rather to cover up the scar. She was very pretty and very smart and very nice and like so vibrant and full of life. She was such a fun person, was hard to believe that she was on her way out the door and then within a year she was, she was gone. Oh yeah. It was really weird, man. But uh, you know, my friend was like, would you mind going on this double date with, uh, with my, uh, my girlfriend's friend?

Speaker 1:          02:32:19       And I said, yeah, sure why? He goes, but I gotta tell you something, she's dying of cancer. And it was like, oh, okay. So I go, okay, that's a tough sell for me. She was a tough sell for anywhere she was. She was alive. She was, if she did wind up dying of cancer, but the night that we went and hung out and she was very alive and she was laughing and happy and it was weird. It was weird to know that I was saying that she had already had an operation. She wore a scarf because she had a big scar on her neck, something. She had something removed from her neck, but she was still like really pretty and really fun. And she was only 27 or 28 I think. And then how long ago was this? Long Time? A long, long, long time ago.

Speaker 1:          02:33:00       It was in the nineties and she died. It was crazy. You know, it's weird to think that your body can just go wacky on Ya. And literally your body starts growing shit that's not supposed to be growing there. And it enters into your system. And then before you know it, you've got a real problem and everything's shutting down. Just going to check out. Horrible. Yeah, that's, that's great. Joe. Um, I went to the bathroom. What the hell happened? I heard through the grape vine that a, you, there's a video out of you being on top of the fucking Chrysler building or something. Is this, is this true? Did you, did you get into the bowels of the Chrysler building with some fucking nutty dude and he climbed up on top of the roof and you got like a video of this. Is that possible? Or there's no video.

Speaker 1:          02:33:52       There's no video. There's no video out, there's no video out. It hurts. Well, the rumor is you heard through the grapevine. The rumor is that, I don't know. I'm, I want to say anything, I'll just tell you what I've heard. Rumor is that you have a video that you were there personally, while some fucking lunatic was climbing out onto the actual eagles that overhang on the Chrysler building, so he's literally walking around on this metal that is not designed to carry a fucking grown man. By the way. Imagine that. Metal would be slippery. Slippery as fuck. He's got street shoes on and he's standing on top of this thing and it's how many floors you're seeing this. How many floors is it might be 60 stories. Jesus, fuck that guy's nuts. Not seen this. Huh? I've heard this is what I heard is what I've heard.

Speaker 1:          02:34:43       Is it true? Is it gets really windy up there. Is it real? How do you. How do you get there in the first place? Fuck. How does one get there? Let's say hypothetically, how would one get there? Get there. If you were writing a novel that was exactly how it all went down, how would you have the characters do it? This is a novel. This is all fiction, so you're in. This is. This. Didn't actually happen, but if it did happen in your book and your book, How would the guy do it? Well, tell me a little nervous. Listen, don't be nervous. There's nothing he can do. This is all hypothetical. We've already laid that out. Well, the Guy Moses that took me Undergrad, he, he, you know, he knows some things. He's done some things. He might have been on the Eagle. It was him.

Speaker 1:          02:35:27       The same guy. He might have been. He might have been on your book and your book, his book. You'll be. You'll be writing this book that's coming out in March. Oh yeah, there. That's the thing. That's the slipper eagle that motherfucker's stood on that. Yeah. Oh my God. Just why? Looking at my skin's crawling. My assholes quivering. I haven't even talked to my hands are sweating crazy. I haven't even talked about this on my own show yet. What did you do? What happened? Tell me what the fuck he's going to be so fucking pissed off. Shit. What I mean, but you can word gets out there. The Internet has no secrets. Well, why would he take me on this amazing tour and it allow me to tow and allow me to film it, you know, because maybe he's a crazy. That's why he's fucking climbing around on metal eagles.

Speaker 1:          02:36:15       Sixty nine store. What if he slipped and you look up his bucket list? Moses Gates. What if he slipped off and you had that? I had my first anxiety attack, panic attack. Looking at that, uh, when I went home that night, over and over, over and over again, I, I pictured him falling from that Eagle. What would you have done? Would you have gotten in trouble if he didn't, do you think, how am I going to explain that? I think you would have been okay. How? How do you know I didn't push them? You have good lawyers. Why would you push them and him sitting on Jesus Christ. Is that him? So it's on the Internet, right? Okay. So he's a crazy fuck. Photos of him. It's on his God damn twitter page op. A photo of him on his fucking twitter page is him that's sitting on that Eagle.

Speaker 1:          02:36:57       So you don't have to worry. That's Moses Gates. He said cities, hidden cities. Uh, Fuck Moses. The TV show, I swear to God, what's wrong? There's nothing wrong with that. Well, a book. Well, I did make a kind of a promise of the guy. His book comes out and March Kim in his promises. Dude's got a picture of him standing on top of thing on his twitter page basically like, Hey, don't tell anybody that I'm standing on top of this thing. Meanwhile he's got a photo of it basically. All right, if you have a photo of it. So we went off the hook, we went under ground,

Speaker 4:          02:37:28       the mole people used to live and then he goes, I want to show you something else. So I go, all right, I'm up, but he won't tell me. We take a cab ride and I kind of seen the distance. It's the Chrysler building. I'm like, I think he's fucking taking me to the Chrysler building. Oh Shit. And uh, all of a sudden we got past security. His name was on a list and uh, we went in the elevators and we went up to, I think the, I want to say like the, well, I don't know, I don't want to say, but in the fifties and then all of a sudden we get out of the elevator and do a quick dark to the, uh, the stairwell and then we went up another, I don't know, like maybe seven or eight floors and next thing you know, there might've been a door unlocked. That isn't an office that is abandoned.

Speaker 1:          02:38:16       And from that you can get that office allegedly to the bowels or rather the peak the attic. Oh Wow. You're going there. I thought I was doing the first part of the story. God was this. So, uh, this abandoned office leads to, I think it used to be an observation deck back in the day, but the railings really low. It's only about four feet. I think. Something like that. People didn't give a fuck back then. No. And that's harder people and that. And you're looking at it right now. If you're watching, you know, watching this podcast, that's the iconic eagles that had been in a shitload of movies and whatnot. I'm telling you right now, a lot my fucking hands are sweating. Looking at that picture, my hands are sweating. My toes were wiggling back and forth. I'm shitting my pants. I'm just going to unload them my fucking cyber right now.

Speaker 1:          02:39:06       So this guy knew that the, the office space was abandoned and this guy knew also that the door was unlocked so he knew how to do it when he'd gotten. He's obviously, he's taking fucking pictures up there. Well there's, there's a, there's a whole network of people. They go to each other cities and do this shit. So I'm on top of each other's rooms and whatever. This is good. This video is that guys on the ground and like old water tunnels and there's guys like climbing the fucking bridges and all that Shell of being up there lesbians. So we had to go up. So then the door was the door to the outside was open sliding door and then it's like an old fucking observation deck with those eagles. And then as I'm at, as I'm at one of the eagles just kind of filming shit, all of a sudden I look over and he's standing on the head of the Eagle.

Speaker 1:          02:39:56       He doesn't even tell me. So yeah, there you go. There's the picture of soaking wet. And then he did it again and that I do have a video of them doing it. Fuck it. I do have, when he turns around and get back to safety, I saw the slight slip. I saw how it would happen. Oh my God. Where that's all it would take because this thing is like Kinda. It's first of all, it's not flat. It's, it's it, it's some kind of metal which looks really slippery. And there was a wind. The wind was about 30 miles an hour that day. And I saw him turn around and that just slight slip. I'm like, that's how it would have happened. So when I went home that night and I saw that play over and over again in my head and I had my first fucking anxiety tech.

Speaker 1:          02:40:42       I'm a middle aged man. I've never had an anxiety attack before my heart was pounding out of my chest. I woke up my wife and she had a fucking calm me down because over and over again I saw him fucking fallen. If I was there, I would have given you a hit of some of this shit and it will put you right over the edge. No Shit right there at that moment. Then you give a hit of that green crack and he'd be like, what? And then we might have done other shit watching that. Just watching. That almost gives me a heart attack. So I got video of him going out and kissing the head and he's a crazy man. It's crazy. Yeah man. That's those things break off and then it kills people below to. What do you mean breaks off? If it broke off, what if, what if his weight.

Speaker 1:          02:41:21       It's just not designed to carry 180 pound man or whatever the alleyways. Oh there he is on twitter. So yeah, he's crazy as fuck that. All right. So that part of the story. I could tell that thrill. We know who we have coming in. Folks. We have Alex honnold. Do you know who Alex honnold is? Alex honnold is, uh, he's coming in on the 28th. He's that kid who free climbs. He Free Solo climbs like things that go backwards. So like he's hanging off and climbing and pulling himself up like thousands of feet. He resold climbs places that nobody else can do. What about the guy I forgot his name and Jim Norton's a big fan of is the guy that climbs outside of the buildings without any anything. Who's at a French dude? Somebody helped us out. He climbs buildings. There's a million videos online. It's Spiderman guy is.

Speaker 1:          02:42:09       It's. Does he call himself list spite on my hands. I am less spatter, but there's a video where he was climbing a building and they made them wear a harness. He didn't want to. Yeah. This video of him fucking slipping. It would have been his death maybe, but maybe because of the harness. That's why he slipped. Say you always got an answer. Seems like you always have a safety net. You'll fall. You're always thinking out of the box. Cop didn't have a safety net and that's why you're successful in this radio business. If you had that safety net was logan bend, what does that. This is the world's largest building in China. This is the guy climbing this fucking thing. Spiderman guy. He uses a suction cup. Things. Oh my God, but he's got a court. Is this the time when he had the safety net? The safety line. Oh my God. Look at this guy you've never seen. This guy knows pretty much every tall building in the world up just hanging off the side like it's no fuck outta me. Shit. My pants shitting my pants. Just watching them. No Shit. I that. That is the

Speaker 4:          02:43:12       fear of heights thing, man. Looking over the edge of a building. There was many times while we're filming fear factor, we were at the top of buildings and that would just freak myself out and just look over the edge of the Chrysler building. That was pretty amazing. That's one of the tallest buildings in Manhattan, right? Yeah. Without with the World Trade Center towers. Is that number one state building number one? Empire State building? Well, no, I said the new freedom tower, wherever the fuck they call it is now officially taller and the Freedom Tower is not done yet, right? No, no. It's almost, they're really. When is it going to be done? Maybe next year. That's got to be crazy to live in a city and see something like that happen because all of us that experienced September 11th, we experience it from the west coast. You know, it was creepy. I, I, I, I'll never forget the smell of a plastic and death.

Speaker 4:          02:44:05       You could smell dramatic pause. Yeah. Oh yeah. Like I, I stayed, I wasn't living in the city at the time, but uh, I stayed for a few days so we could broadcast because they shut down the whole fucking city. And in midtown you smelled burning plastic and you smelled death. There was no doubt in your fucking mind that was, that was dead people all the way in mid town. I don't know how many miles officially that is from ground zero, but you know, it's quite a hike. And I also remember that some people were just going about their day, like nothing was different. I remember like studying people, I remember looking at these two women, they were going to happy hour and they were just talking about their dme office, you know, their day at the office. And I'm sitting there thinking to myself, Holy Fuck, do you understand just what happened to the city 24 hours ago?

Speaker 4:          02:44:52       Oh God, I never, never forgot that. Yeah, it's weird how people can do that. It's weird if some people can just kind of shut off and disconnect to that because most of the people living in New York, they were all like, holy fuck. But you did see these other people that they basically their, their lives didn't change that day. I noticed that when I went to work that people were friendlier. The people got a lot friendlier beyond friendly. All of a sudden like you're looking people in the eyes. Like when you live in New York City, you don't look at anybody. Yeah, it's a very lonely place. There's so many people, but it's not weird. It's a lonely place. Like there's no one looks at anyone. No one strikes depending conversations. Very rare, but after nine slash 11, everyone was talking to each other. It's really cool. It's a weird thing about New York or you go to a big place and it's crowded with people and no one's talking to anybody and everybody's being themselves.

Speaker 4:          02:45:43       Unless they know they can get a buck off, you know? It's very strange. They know they can make money off and then they're talking to you, but in general you're not having that. You know that small talk. Like I live in a building. I've been there for years. I don't know anyone in my building. No one talks to anyone. I see the same people in the elevator and I want to look at him like we know each other. How about we talk a little bit and I've tried, but I think you're a creep. No, it happens to everybody. It'd be easy to say that, but no, but then when you do have a with someone in the

Speaker 1:          02:46:09       elevator of my building, you know they're visiting. There's no doubt in your mind because they're the ones that are having that small. They don't think you're creep when you're trying to start up a conversation. Oh, I don't know because I feel like God, we've seen it so many times. I don't think I'm doing anything out of the ordinary. I never liked that about New York. I always thought that was really unfortunate that, that, that sort of a behavior exists, right? People like real standoffish with each other. And one of the things that I liked the most about living a when I lived in Colorado was a few people there where there's only a 100,000 people in Boulder. People are very friendly, you know, because it's just less, less burnout. It's like, you know, you're around people all the time. You're like, fuck, we can get the fuck away from me, but then if you see somebody that you haven't seen it forever, you're so happy to see them.

Speaker 1:          02:46:53       It's like you to find. You have to strike a balance point. I don't think the balance point is stalking people up 70 funding stories high and I kind of miss when I used to live in western New York, it was more of a small town mentality. Have you guys ever earlier, have you ever thought about moving somewhere else? You and Anthony ever thought about not living in New York and just fucking taking the show on the road somewhere? Oh hell no, no, no. I don't. I don't even know how many more years we're going to do it. What are you gonna do? If you don't do that? Just chill out for a awhile. The Fuck Outta here. What are you gonna die going to get old. I'll fall apart. Can hang out with him right back and just chill out. Know you guys should do it for real. You should do.

Speaker 1:          02:47:28       Exactly. We're trying to figure out what's next for us to do exactly what you're doing, but do it on the Internet because that's what's going to be in everyone's fucking stereo. Everyone's car stereo is going to be connected to the Internet. We probably should have made the leap this last contract, but you can make the leap to years slowly, you know, you could just do it under assumed names that everybody knows, you know, he could come up with your own name, you know, fucking Douchey, you know, whatever. Call it. I think a Dale Dudley. They call themselves teabagging taint. I think he's got some sort of a, a contract issue, things like that. Just do it and just start it up with what could they do. I've done it for a long time. I know, but it's easy and it's fun. I'm just looking for something new and different.

Speaker 1:          02:48:10       Oh yeah. Like what? I don't know. That's the problem. Hmm. I don't know. I've been fooling around with this video. The west coast. Come on out here, man. I've had a lot of fun because I'd have a video on desk squad. Bring you full circle. It's podcasts. Will fucking make some videos. I can squat and be right next to Kevin Pereira. Yeah. So I hope Moses isn't pissed. Abby. Listen, Moses is a crazy fuck and he's got other things to worry about. How about his need to climb on top of that Eagle? He's crazy. Asshole and then we might have done other shit. I don't want to hear it. And I'm getting nervous. My hands literally or sweaty or wet. It was wet. That was. Yeah. It'll come out. It'll come out in March because I sort of promised the guy, well woopsies, but if his, if he's sitting on the Eagle on his twitter. I guess where I right with that. Yeah. These, uh, Alex honnold guy that we've got coming in, you know, we were talking about him. I told Steve Rinella. I go, yeah, I got Alex honnold is coming in. He's going to do the podcast. Goes better. Get Him in as quick as you can. Those guys ain't going last.

Speaker 4:          02:49:08       I don't even know who he is to be honest with you. He's the climber Guy. The Free Solo that. Oh, okay. Right, right, right. He better get him in because he's not going to last. He's going to fall right eventually. I don't know. Maybe not. He knows what he's doing. Shit that takes fucking balls. You ever see those guys like those, those real mountain climbers where they have to be up there for the night and they set up their fucking. You can't even call it a tense and whatever the fuck the apparatuses that is just hanging off the side of it and they and they were able to get a good night's sleep. How the fuck did you do that? You know, if you roll over and you're sleeping right up the edge and then you realize as you feel your back touch the ledge. All my God, I'm going off in the tent.

Speaker 4:          02:49:52       No, you're, you're, you're off the ledge. These, these sleeping. I don't know what they're officially called. You're actually off the ledge sleeping. Somehow they hammered into the side of the fucking. Oh Jesus Christ, cliff or whatever. Can you can find a picture that is insane. What is it called? I don't know. He'll, he'll find it, but they set it up because you know, their climb. Is that, that fucking long and they got to like camp out for awhile and there's no, you know, they're on the side of the fucking. What do you think of those crazy fucks that kitten, those wingsuits saying? Did you see that one video? It doesn't look jumps, attend, things like that. Yeah. Just hanging off the side and, and, and it's somewhere in your brain. You're like, yeah, this is cool. I'm going to, I'm going to now sleep and then I'll continue my climb in the morning.

Speaker 4:          02:50:37       So insane. Yeah. What are the, what are those? Oh my God. Look at how that is set up. That is the craziest fucking thing I've ever looked at in my life. Really? And you've seen some shit. Those things are crazy. They're hanging those things off the edge and they're just sleeping in those little tent things. You gotta you gotTa. Hope that what? However you fucking fast, you know, put to the side of the. Yeah, the rock face that it's going to be. All right. Fucking Bananas Open. That one up Brian. That one looked like just having the one to the left of that. Oh my God. It is hanging out. Reading the is so fun. Seeing this one before raising. I'm Kinda happy that I was able to turn you onto. Oh my gosh, these people are not. You're always turned me onto some shit. I finally got got one for you.

Speaker 4:          02:51:28       Could you do that? Oh, I mean, I guess I could, but I wouldn't like it at all. All my instincts. The last. I don't know. I mean, you're essentially like shutting off that part of your brain that tells you you're, you're shitting your pants. Fuck. You know, it tells you you could die with one little slip. Those guys die all the time. Those climber guys, that's a. that's a crazy life. Of course you might. You might make it, you might be fine. So what's up with the wing suits? It does. Cause rather than mom, did you see the one video where the guy thinks holding up the balloons or something and the wing suit guy comes flying through and I think it's on Vimeo or something. He's holding up a balloon tweeted the other day. It was just amazing. He jumped off the top of a fucking mountain and now he's flying through the valley and, and he's coming towards buddy.

Speaker 4:          02:52:13       And the buddy I think holds up balloons or something literally right over his head and he comes flying at. You could barely see. It's just like a flash. Yeah, they're going really fast. They go like 100 miles an hour. That is fucked up. They're so silly. Look at these motherfuckers climbing this wall. These people are so crazy. You're, you're a fingertip strength. It's got to be ridiculous. Oh yeah. These guys can do mad chin ups to their hand strength and their, their ability to do chin ups. It's fucking nuts. What am I doing? Like one finger chin-ups. Mars works on our show. I didn't see it. I heard him talking about. But I had to do something before we start our radio show. Last week there was a video he was going, this fucking guy's doing a chin ups with one finger, you know? Have you seen it?

Speaker 4:          02:53:00       No, but I believe it. You believe it? Yeah. Yeah. People can fucking. Finger just takes time. You know, you start out with your full hand. Then you work your way to four fingers, three fingers to. And the more you keep doing it, you can do it. Wow. The guys can do chin ups, pushups rather with one finger. I've seen that one finger on each side. Guys do pushups, full pushups. Amazing. Supporting themselves with one finger, right? Yeah. You can develop a crazy strengthen your hands and your tendons. It's like the difference between someone who's really strong and someone who's not really strong is at the summit is really strong. Oh look at this guy fall.

Speaker 4:          02:53:34       Looking at him. He's being a dick head. He's having fun. The difference. Having fun because he slipped and caught himself and was okay with the difference between someone really strong and someone's not really strong besides genetics, is that someone is really strong, forced their body to get strong by making it lift weights a lot and keep going and keep going. Fuck you. Lift away. It's fuck you lift the weights. So this Alex honnold guy and he's climber guys, they're constantly climbing and oh my God, this guy just felt look at this. Oh Shit has got all in my God ain't knows how to grab them. You get a slam it to the side now, but the impact that the impact, I never had a discipline that line on that thing that's supporting him. That's so crazy because at that breaks off, man, you're fucked and he's just silly around their hands get super strong because they just force them to.

Speaker 4:          02:54:26       They're constantly carrying shit with their hands. Their hands just get sick as fuck. The kid is coming in. He has his family there. His fingers like sausage fingers, so twice the size of a normal finger. Really? Yeah. They just, they just get huge from carrying his weight. He's not a big guys like they want to be very slight, big hands and be a slight person. Carry yourself around that, but you know, it's a weird way to get you thrills, you know? Sure. It's a weird way to just get your jollies out of climbing the top of something that can fucking kill you at sleeping on the side. Don't go to the top of the Chrysler. We got to wrap this

Speaker 1:          02:55:04       bitch up. Joe. This was fun, man. You got me out of my comfort zone. I'm so happy you came down to this. I would. This podcast owes you a lot man, not just for naming death squad, which is a ridiculous name, but you know, that deserves a twitter plug, but anyone but not, not just data, but that's for Stan, for creating a radio show that allowed us to realize that there's a show in [inaudible] talking because there's a show and just hanging and that, you know, you guys make it so comfortable for us, for comics to come in and fuck around. And uh, I think a lot of podcasts really followed that lead. I kind of, I don't want to play that game usually, but I kind of get that feeling. A lot of the podcasts are very, very much like one. I feel like it, you guys are the most unstructured of all the major radio show told you that's because we're lazy and it just worked out because it works.

Speaker 1:          02:55:54       That's the right way to do it. You're lucky to the lazy way's the right way to do it. We actually, we used to like prepare for our show and we, we, that was like, that was some of our worst shows that because we did try to have structure for awhile there and there's some days where like we don't even know what the fuck we're doing, but by the end of the show we, you know, we had a good one. You guys have an awesome group between Norton who's in my opinion, the funniest fucking guy was ever been on radio ever. He makes me how all that kind of regular basis listen to that show just because he's so perverted and twisted in these, carved out his own little fucking slice of the world with that, you know, his way and you know his way of thinking, so it's extra hilarious when he says something crops up and then Anthony's fucking bananas and you're crazy and the three guys together know each other so well and then you bring in comics.

Speaker 1:          02:56:39       It's just awesome. It's been a good run, man. It has and it is for real is the reason why we do this podcast today. I guarantee you it has a lot to do with it in a weird that someone will acknowledge us. Weird. Yeah. Not many people to really know what that to feel left out. Poor. Oh No, no. Honestly it means a lot. Thank you. Listen, I don't know how to handle that because we don't. We usually don't hear that. Well, listen, you guys, you, you created the most fun environment and radio for comics to come and hang out and you brother. And because of that you've had so many funny fucking shows. I mean, it's just a brilliant, brilliant run. You know, it's not like it's over anything. I'm saying it like it's over. Like you're retiring and shit. I'll be on the radio tomorrow.

Speaker 1:          02:57:21       I stayed in La just for you. Have you done live in the compound? Have you done in the compound? He's another reason. Anthony is another reason why we do it. That's why we started doing it on ustream. Yeah. He, uh, he's not naughty motherfucker you work with. I love him. I love that guy. Yeah. Well I'm going to be there. Uh, I think in April or something like that or March. So whenever there's a huge, there's a UFC coming up there soon. I'm taking her on the radio tomorrow.
