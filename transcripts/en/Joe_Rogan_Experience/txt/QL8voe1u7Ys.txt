Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Five, four, three, two, one. Hey Fella. Hey, what's going on? Not much. How are you? I'm good. How are you? I'm great. Wonderful. We're a little fucking high ride. We're going to get through it. I'm so bummed. I was thinking about going to Hawaii the other day and then his volcano happened. I'm like, of all the times I was there, I. Oh, you were there when it happened. It was in Lanai. I was on one of the other islands. Did you feel the earthquake? No, I didn't feel it. It's, you know, it's separated by quite a lot is a lot of water and the way the big earthquake happened actually after the plane took off, so we were in the air when the big one hit. Yeah. Which it's apparently a big one, like a five nine. I think it was even more than that.

Speaker 1:          00:00:44       Was it six? Oh, oh, right. They had a big one and then they had a fucking really big one in five night's big. I think the way it works, I'm sure someone will correct me here. I think the way it works is a five. Six is like really powerful, but a five, seven is twice as powerful than a five. Eight is twice as powerful as that. So when you get up to seven, like that's some world changing shit. It's actually six point nine. Oh my God. That's insane. Oh my God. Can you imagine being on the icon? Was that powerful? That's so big. That's such a big earthquake, man. Did you see the um, I put it up. It's so funny, Dude. You put up anything that's from CNN and people want you to put it up from a verifiable source. Not Cnn. CNN is bullshit.

Speaker 1:          00:01:30       It's a video. You fucking asshole. It's a video of lava eating a car. My stake. CNN faked. It was great to say I'll look to see conclusive evidence that CNN is not full of shit. And then I'll go to their website. Stupid to people are so goofy, so goofy with this fake new shit. It's lava. It ate a car. It happened. Did you see the video? Yeah, the white, the white car. Polish it up. I think it's good that that cards forever going to be in rock. So like when we all died in like the future, like people can like find this car, the, it's broken down to the bare elements at this point, I'm assuming it just got completely melted. I wonder. They say that stuff is 2000 degrees and it's so hot, but it's molten rock. So like if it didn't burn through your feet or if you, if you weren't flammable at all for some strange reason, you could actually walk on it.

Speaker 1:          00:02:29       I'm like, what? I cut thought you would just sink in it, but no, it apparently it's cooling like right out of after it gets out of the surface. Oh this is so crazy. This is like a monster. So we're watching this lava flow on Hawaii's big island. I liked how Jamie went with CBS news, bro folk the food news. Actually Brandon Clement got the video. Oh powerful. Brendan Clement. But this guy, whoever he is a bad motherfucker because look what he was next to. He was filming this. I mean he was near this thing. Oh my God. Like imagine being on that street and staying. What kind of a crazy fuck you have to be to be on that street and stay and then it's six point nine hits during all this. That's so big. That's such a crazy earthquake, but they live on a volcano. I mean, it's one of the reasons why a lot of people don't want to live on the big island.

Speaker 1:          00:03:23       So shit like this. Yeah, that's splatter. One's crazy that there's a fissure in this neighborhood. There's a subdivision out there and something estates. I forget what it is, but they're fucking April. Do the. The, the ground opened up in their neighborhood. I mean, if you lived, you know, thousands of years ago, this would be an angry God coming to attack your village. Could you imagine if normal days you're in Hawaii, you're in one of the most beautiful places on the planet. You're just chilling and the sun is perfect and you'd seen the ocean, you hear the seagulls and you see dolphins and shit, and then the ground opens up and hell starts pouring out. Eats your house each Mustang fuck. And they were talking about it today in the news. They're like, there's nothing we can do. There's nothing that I can pour water on. Nope, can't do shit.

Speaker 1:          00:04:15       You're not going to stop it. It's too big. They apparently stopped it from doing something in like Iceland and they had to use billions and billions of gallons of water to halt the progress of the lava. I forget what it was. That big plume was in the air and you couldn't fly anywhere. I believe so. And that is also that plume being in the air, which restricted flying is all tied into the death of that journalist. Michael Hastings. Do you know that? Oh, that crazy conspiracy theory. It's one of the weirder ones, man. It's one of the weirder ones. This guy, Michael Hastings was this sort of renegade journalist type character and he went to Iraq or Afghanistan, um, I want to say Iraq, but it might've been Afghanistan. He went there with the troops and he got stuck there because of that volcano. So because you stuck there, everybody got comfortable with him being around.

Speaker 1:          00:05:15       They started saying crazy shit to start joking around about Obama and stuff like that. And he put all this in the article and when you put all this in the article, that general had to resign and he was like one of the most popular and most powerful generals in the army. Then shortly thereafter, homeboy decided to go 120 miles an hour down sunset and slammed into a tree and his car exploded and everybody's like, it's a fucking burger. Hits assassination. And then there was all these tech guys that were coming out and they were saying, listen, you absolutely can hack a car and change the direction. Change the, the what, what the car does take control of the car. You absolutely can do. And they were like, abs. Absolutely. He was like, absolutely you can absolutely. One hundred percent. You do it. Do you have. We know these people, there's videos of people falling asleep in their Teslas, right?

Speaker 1:          00:06:07       The car just drives you there. You get on the highway, just drives you. We know that's real. It turns, it'll turn, will make turns for you. It'll park. They have cars, the park. You don't think that they can, that they figured out a long time ago say, wouldn't it be cool if we could just tap into that and make this motherfucker drive into a tree or star kids? They didn't. They would be so incompetent that I don't want to hear any conspiracy theories ever again because of the government didn't look at that stuff. If the government like this assassins didn't look at that angle. Bobo Bobo. Hold on a second. So you telling me if the head of Isis is in a car and it's a Mercedes, we can hack into that car and make that motherfucker drive off a cliff. We can do that. Okay, well let's do that 100 percent.

Speaker 1:          00:06:50       Those people all day of trying to figure out a way to kill bad guys. You don't think they would think that? Of course they would. So that's the scary thought. But then the other possibility is homeboy was losing his mind because of the pressure, which is entirely possible. You always have to like look at everything. You've got to look at all sides. You really do. It's so. It's so easy to just pick a side on any story or a conspiracy theory or anything, even a political opinion, so easy to just dig your heels in, but in this one you gotta look at this guy. They definitely found amphetamines in his system. They said, and that's not uncommon for writers. Writers love adderall. It fucking love it. Apparently. I have a friend who's a journalist, says everybody who's a journalist is on adderall. Obviously. He's exaggerating the one guy's out there, like, no folk, not fucking mood, but um, who was it that was a doctor? Oh, my friend, Dr Roddy Mckee the, the stem cell doctor from Vegas. He was telling me about people that were taken adderall like when he was in college and he's like, Holy Shit, it's my breasts mail throws me listerine strips. Okay Dude, I'll fucking take one. Blindly flipped it.

Speaker 1:          00:08:08       But he was saying that Williamson colleges like a market change in everybody's performance. Once they started doing the adderall. I believe it. Jamie gave it to me. He gave me a little tiny piece, allegedly. Maybe not. Maybe I just made that up officer. I don't know what that was. I don't know what the fuck that was. I didn't take it either way. I'm, I'm scared of it. I'm scared. I'm gonna take it and go. Yes. This is what I need. Right. Like the same, same reason. I would be scared of coke. I've never fucked with coke. I like coffee too much. I like it. I drink it, but I'm not even tired. I'll just look for a cup of coffee, like come on in, have a cup of coffee and be nice. Right now I feel like I crack like cracky when I'm on adderall lake as it could get into like the whole time to make you talk too much.

Speaker 1:          00:08:48       Uh, I've only done like three times, but I remember I tried to do it and go on stage and it was awful. I felt like I was on. My timing was all like jeter, Gdg, gender, gender. When you got to take into account like there's the way you feel before you go onstage and it there's the way you feel onstage, the adrenaline you have to take into account that that adrenaline is going to be there. It's kind of mix in. Yeah. I did modafinil once. It did modafinil on stage and it was a weird little balancing act. That's that pro vigil stuff, right? It was weird. It was like, Whoa, this is weird. You know, you better off sober. You just put the. The thing about those pills apparently is he get used to it and then you get used to that juice. You know, you're used to just fucking have the energy to get shit done.

Speaker 1:          00:09:32       Come on Brian. Let's start a fucking business. Come on Brian. Let's organize. We've got to make a nonprofit that carries the same name as everybody gets super, super fired up, but you can get a lot of shit done that way. So that's the thing with journalists apparently according to my friend, he's like, dude, everybody's on it. They're all on it and they write like maniacs. They just fucking pound the keys. But it makes sense in that take your pills documentary on Netflix. That's what they talk about too. I need to see that percent of kids in high school college taking it to stick it through. Well, I think it's a performance enhancing drug. So here's the question. Is it worse than drinking? I bet it isn't and we don't have any problem with all those kids drinking. The question is, are they going to get addicted to it more easily than they would get addicted to drinking because you don't have this.

Speaker 1:          00:10:20       I mean, I don't know, but I'm assuming you don't have nearly the same kind of hangout where right. It was. How, how does it affect your liver in comparison to like alcohol? Because I think adderall and that kind of shit. Fuck might be worse in that aspect. I think you'd see a lot of bodies if it were. I think there'd be a lot of dead people. I really do. This is what I think. I think it's one of those where's the body's thing like where's the bodies? Whereas the bodies, you know, where are they? It might be one of those things. Oh, you don't want to do lot of buddies going to have to flex and Dolly, oh, are you sure you sure everybody's already doing it. Booze, like there was a fucking stupid article that I was reading about the Keto Diet. It was so dumb.

Speaker 1:          00:11:03       He was so poorly written and uninformed because they were talking about a study they did where they took people and they put them on a Keto diet for four days and their athletic performance decreased and then they even included the caveat this could possibly be because of the Keto flu, which is something that sometimes people get when their body goes into before your body goes into Ketosis, takes a long time to switch your body off from a lifetime, but burning carbs to burning fat. The real health benefits in athletic performance, if any all happen after your body gets through this transitionary period, so they did a study about four days of the Diet, like who gives a shit? Why would you do that? That's not how it works. It takes weeks before your body even totally transitions over and then even then the benefits and include increased rather over months.

Speaker 1:          00:11:55       Ms Dot plenty of science on this stuff, like the people that have had on the podcast that talked about it like Dom D'agostino and all the studies that he's done on it. Uh, Peter Attia, who's on the other day, he's like real scientists who are like the, the data's out there. You could look at it. It doesn't work for everybody in terms of the benefits of it, but you don't do it over four days. Like why? So they're saying it's dangerous. Potentially dangerous dive. It's fucking food. It's not dangerous. You know what's really dangerous? Eating the same way most people eat every day. You know what I was while I was watching a video with this guy from, you know, the company called Flavor God. I've seen that. It's a spice company. He makes really delicious spices. And he had this video. He went to a store and he just picked out a garlic salt, like, okay, let's try this one right here. And he picks it up and it says sugar in it. Sugars, third ingredient in fucking garlic salt. So I go home after I watched this video, I pick up the car. So I'm like, that looks like the shit that I have in my house. I pick it up. It's under garlic salt. It has fucking loves sugar. It's like the third or fourth ingredient is sugar. I'm like, you gotta be kidding me. They put sugar in garlic, salt these monsters. That's insane. That's not right dude.

Speaker 1:          00:13:08       These monsters. Is he selling it as a spice or is it say garlic salt on it says regular. It's a big company. It's a green cap. It says garlic salt. His stuff is just garlic and salt and real spices and whatever. This flavor God guy. So he's just pointing out like, look man, you're getting fucked over. And I didn't know. I had no idea I was pouring this dye. Put this stuff on my eggs. I didn't know there's sugar in it. That's ridiculous. Why would you put sugar in garlic? Salt? You've got the. Don't call it garlic salt. Then call it Tony Spices. This is Tony Spices. I put a little of this. I put a little of that. You know what I like? My grandmother always put sugar in everything. Fuck it. Sugar. It seems like that should be illegal. It should be illegal. Fucking asshole.

Speaker 1:          00:13:50       Because if. What? If you can't have sugar, never think to look and check every fucking label to make sure someone's not sneaking some sugar in on you. Creepy fucks. Speaking and creepy fucks. Did you hear about that nurse who is going to jail because she was infecting patients with HIV, with Hepatitis C. She was infecting her hepatitis c blood into their medication. Why? Well, she's crazy. She's crazy. She was giving them Hep c on purpose is what they're alleging. At least here it is. Nurse allegedly used her own drug needles on patients leading to hepatitis C infections. Okay, so I'd read it differently. I'd read that she injected the medication with her blood. She had put her blood in the medication. Maybe that was just a shitty article I read, but either way. Okay, so what they're saying is

Speaker 1:          00:14:50       she's suspicious of two counts of second degree assault. She's not been formally charged and our mother Eunice told the media at the news conference prior to that, her daughter wouldn't hurt a bug. Hmm. So say a Washington emergency room nurses accused of stealing narcotics and injecting to hospital patients with Hep c using the same needles that she used to inject herself. Okay. So the not saying she infected it with her blood, their blood on purpose. She just did something super irresponsible and used her needles on these patients. So what she did was. So what they're alleging is that she's using narcotics and she would get too much for the patients and give some theirself and they use that same needle to give it to the patients probably because needles are tightly controlled because they don't know. They probably have to account for every needle missing so they don't give them the junkies and they probably have to account for all the narcotics.

Speaker 1:          00:15:43       So she would probably give them some of hers since as she intentionally contaminated medicine or other substance with her own blood. See, that's what I read. See, this is a different thing. This is a different website you just pulled out intentionally contaminated medicine or another substance with their own blood. Then she administered the medicine, medicine or other substance intravenously. So the way she did it wasn't by putting her blood into the medication on purpose. The way she did it was by taking some of their medication allegedly. So I haven't seen any evidence that she would have that would prove that she intentionally infected anyone. Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:16:24       It's her attorney. Yeah, that's her attorney. Yeah. Um, so we'll go to the top because there was something about narcotics, right? I've read this. There's a book called dead doctors don't lie and it's all about this Guy Dr Joel Wallach, and it was all about mineral deficient diets. And then how many people are mineral deficient diets because us farmlands are just a totally overrun with, uh, you know, you use the same land over and over and over again. They're overrun from the crops, like just drained the dirt. So they have to add minerals to the soil and they have to add shit to it. And this guy, Dr Joel Wallach, was talking about how you have to realize like there's a lot of people out there that over time mineral deficient diets will show poor health results, right? So he was going on about how little doctors know about health in general, you know, how to fix things, but how little many doctors know about like good diet and what's important, what kind of nutrients really need because they really don't spend that much time in school, much less time than the average person who sort of obsessed with it.

Speaker 1:          00:17:27       But then he started going on about how many doctors they find dead from overdoses and stories about doctors that just shot themselves up in a break room and tie shot lock themselves up in a bathroom and shot coke. Like if they're that tired and that worn down and they have access to coke, I bet I bet a lot of them did it. Especially when you could get. If you get away with it,

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       especially if they have that liquid. And in the hospitals they're probably just huffing that stuff too. They still have that liquid coat. They have lidacain right. But they have liquid. What do they use the liquid coq for? For a numbing agent. Right. Well that's what Lidocaine is. Right? Same thing though, but I don't think a lot of king gets you high. I know this girl that used to, I don't know if she made it, but I always thought it was from a doctor. It was like an inhaler type thing and she would just do that some or. No, no, it was a nose thing. Like a sprayed nose thing. Like a flonase. Flonase for coke. Yeah. And she would just do that and she would like was just shoot liquid cocoa butter smell. Yeah. Whoa. That sounds better for you. Then snort and I don't know, it's like moisturizing.

Speaker 2:          00:18:34       The best way is apparently chew those leaves. You ever done that? No, I've never even seen that before. Yeah, the coca leaves. That's apparently the best way, but you never get that. That's super rush. It's like the difference between the sugar that you would get from an apple and the sugar you would get from some koolaid. Like you drank a gallon of coolant, homemade koolaid. We dumped extra sugar in there and stir that bitch up. Do you remember that? How great was that? Koolaid is. Delivers your color. What was your Goto? I've never met a cool edit it in like I never drank. One glass of Koolaid was like, this is bullshit. That green one was always weird. They're fucking great. I loved when the big guy with the pitcher burst through the wall to EU Koolaid Cooler. Just smash your house to give you. He was so excited to see you and give you the sugary drink.

Speaker 2:          00:19:25       It would break your fucking house. I did. Still around the Koolaid guy. Is he on the. On the package is still? Yeah. That'd be funny if they made them thinner though, you know, to to like promote like no sugar or something like that. Like the change of time. Get them on diet pills. Get kool aid on the Diet pills. The shot glass now had a adderall. Adderall. Adderall. Okay. Let's find out. How many people die every year from adderall. Let's guess. I'm going to guess I'm going to guess less than a hundred. Oh No, no. It's way more than that. I'd say less than a hundred. $100 in this country every year. That's what I say. I say 59 people die of adderall a year. I'll say $21,000.

Speaker 2:          00:20:09       It would be the worst test ever on the price is right. It's just the chance you're taking. Don't have to go that high. Go a little higher than when you got it. All right. How much have you saved? Fifty nine people. Sixty nine. Sixty nine. What do we got? Jamie? The first thing I found that said that there were 12 deaths associated to seven to 16 year old boys in the year. Two thousand five and there's like articles about sudden death and 12 kids on adderall. So just 12. Yeah, but that's like it's not showing for the year. I don't know why. I think when you die on adderall, they know where you live.

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       They come down, they nuke your house, that kill all the witnesses. Nobody this money and adderall must be through the roof. Well, look at what to happen to cbd. Did you hear about this? Like I bet they have, like the medicine companies have something to do with that. They just made it a schedule one for CBD. Did they really do that? I thought they abandoned on that. I just read it the other day, a quarter with Kratom to courtrooms. CBD scheduled one compound. Cannabinol sales only were pot legal. Well that's just stupid cbd. It's got the most minor levels of thc and it has a definite benefits, especially when you put it on as a lotion. That stuff feels like a court. Appeals Court upholds cbd status as controlled substance. Well fuck you appeals court as against the hemp industry also. Right? That's a huge hit to him.

Speaker 3:          00:21:44       Cross the board. It's a huge hit to humanity. It's just dumb. That stuff's great for old ladies. With arthritis, it's so much better than a lot of medications. You can take it in so many different forms. You could take it as drops. You could take it as a spray. I take it as a, um, an ointment that I'll put on, like I have a sore shoulder or some shit. You can put that stuff on. It's fucking great. I just got, got some recently and my anytime that my neck is sore from like laying weird or being in a hotel with a shitty pillow, I put on like two minutes, just loosens everything up. It's amazing. You know what? I bet it would be great for like a massage. Maybe we'd get fucked up too high. So I'm gonna give you a massage. And CBD Lotion.

Speaker 3:          00:22:22       I did it the other day and I got it in her vagina and I thought it was gonna be bad. Like I was like, oh maybe I shouldn't have done that. And you know, it was fine. Oh that's good. But they, they uh, this company, cbd for life, they gave me all these, like they face lotions, they have the stuff you put underneath your eyes. Like they have so much different kinds of cbd stuff. Yeah. Gino gave me some blue stuff. It's like a roll on roll on deodorant. You put it on like a sore elbow or something. It's great. Yeah. It's doesn't do anything bad to you. The fact that these assholes decided that it'd be a good idea to make that illegal, so dumb. If there's nothing wrong with it, it reduces inflammation. It's healthy. That's it, period. It doesn't do anything wrong, so now you can't buy it anymore.

Speaker 3:          00:23:06       By and places where it's legal, like we could still buy it because we don't live in the dark ages because a lot of dark ages states out there. Do you ever watch that show? A live pd? I think it's called. It's one of my favorite shows, but it's so weird watching people get busted for like weed and you're like, wait, how old is this show? Oh, it's live right now. This is happening in and Ms Dot Karolina. Yeah, there's a bunch of spots we could still get like fully arrested. Go to jail. You're a criminal Texas for pot. Yeah, Texas. They arrested. Willing. Nelson do. They pulled Willie Nelson Office. Tour bus, you know, that's like shooting a bass and a toilet bowl. That's so dumb. It's so dumb. How could you do that? National treasure man. Assholes. Of course he smokes pot. He's a hundred and 50,000 years old.

Speaker 3:          00:23:55       He's been playing music all across this land forever. Leave the guy alone. Let him do whatever he wants. He's Willie Nelson. I mean, if you don't love Willie Nelson, fuck you. Right. Even if you don't want to listen to the guy's music, you like. No. Right now, man. I'm in this Amanda, m and m right now. Okay. I get it, but if you're like, man, fuck Willie Nelson. No, fuck you. What do you think of the Kanye Shit going on? Jamie's kept me fully informed. He talks about every morning. Jamie has got many, many theories. He's got one of those mind boards. Is Housewares kept index cards leading to the center? Yeah. Kanye record releases in the center and then all these things spray out to yeezys and and flip flops and all these slides. Slides and he's got a bunch of theories along the way. I've never heard of your theory, but does it involve the car accident that he had right before he became popular that like, I think he has brain damage from this car accident,

Speaker 4:          00:24:54       that those are the people that honestly think that he is still on. He. Sorry, he said he was on opioids from a getting a light hypo actually because a lot of the uh, media scrutiny on them being fat, he said let them to go getting light bulb, which led them to having a painkiller addiction and he was on an opioid thing and he was very afraid when he went to the psych hospital that he was going to get killed and people are going to take them away for all the shit he was saying. So he did have some issues and I think he's publicly said he has been on some other, um, medication. So he might be on or off of it right now.

Speaker 3:          00:25:30       Well also he should definitely run for president then scoop. I mean, now he's in. It's perfect. It's got all the right ingredients as an artist. That's just an artist, but not. I would take cognac over trump. Any data. Here's that thing that you do. You're out of your mind. Here's that thing that you just said though, about the accident. You know, that's the story of Sam Kinison as well. Oh yeah, yeah. Sam kinison was, uh, when he was a boy, he apparently was like super normal kid and then he got hit by a car really bad. And um, from that point on he became a different person. Kim, wild and reckless and crazy. It's the, it's the football players get their head hit murder their wife, Oj Simpson. Um, you know, his doctor said that they would use that as a defense. They would consider using that as a defense if that trial trials to happen today. One hundred percent. It's like that other guy. The guy ended up killing himself if had the football player, mark was his name. Uh, he went to jail and he hung himself. Martino. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, Adrian, what's his name? Jamie Hernandez. Aaron Hernandez. That's right. Yeah. But they're saying that he probably

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       had that to 100 percent. One hundred percent. It's not a matter of whether or not you have brain damage, it's a matter of how much, how much do you have and can you work with it, you know? That's what I mean. If you get hit in the head a lot, you have brain damage. Your brain does not want to get hit. It's just not normal. Aaron Hernandez suffered from most severe ct ever found in a person his age. He's kind of like brandon shop here. Looks like it looks like Brendan's way more Quito right now. Very a brain like isn't someone younger than someone for 46 years, like 25? Yeah. Dude, I'm telling you. There is a fucking epidemic. This shit, and it includes all sorts of people that get their head hit. Whether it's a bmx guys that are constantly crashing. When you think about how many times bmx guy will crash in his career, how many head head bumps he takes 'em skateboarders, notorious for doing crazy shit wiping.

Speaker 1:          00:27:42       You know what I mean? The older you get the kind of like a pit bull, does it swell and it gets worse? No, no. They do say though, the damage that cumulative, it's a cumulative cumulative over I think a period of like 10 years from the initial incident. So like say if you have a really bad car accident, your brain will continue to deteriorate for 10 years from the effects of that accident. Uh, when, when the guy told me that I was like, how do you know? And I don't know how they know. I don't remember. He kind of explained it, but I was like, wait, so you mean a guy who gets knocked out? We were at the fights when he was telling me this. So I'm like, you tell me a guy who gets knocked out today, it's going to feel the real repercussions of that knockout in 10 years.

Speaker 1:          00:28:25       He's like, yes. It's very possible. That's the case. Wow. That's gonna take 10 years to show it's full effects. So if you see someone who's fucked up now, like if they've got brain damage now, like as time goes on, it's going to be like, like Muhammad Ali was one of the weirder ones because he had developed a neurological disease. He developed Parkinson's. But there's, there's trauma induced Parkinson's. It's a lot of people try to say, no, no, no, I'll. He got Parkinson's. It was a disease. Yeah, maybe. But you know, who else has Parkinson's? Freddie Roach, the boxing coach, and he openly discusses the fact that it's trauma induced. He got it from his long boxing career. Just because it's a brain disease doesn't mean the brain disease didn't come from getting the fuck beat out of your brain. I mean, imagine if you had a game that you played or people like to kick you in the liver.

Speaker 1:          00:29:15       This is the game, you know, you kicked me in the liver, I kick you in the liver and then later on you develop liver cancer and people like. Yeah. But he used to like to drink. Oh, he had sclerosis had nothing to do with getting kicked a lot. Oh, okay. Nothing to do. I'm sure he has a super healthy brain after getting pounded on for decades. That's ridiculous. That doesn't make any sense. Jesus. Yes. Jesus. Dude. I have the probably the most minor of brain damages. President most minor because I stopped when I was 21. Yeah. What's your number? How many times I got hit and now I'm eating like how many times do you think that you like, oh, that did damage. Oh, 100 percent. There's a bunch of them. There's a bunch of them that I could think back. Getting rocked and filling my knees go like getting punched in and then keeps borrowing heaps.

Speaker 1:          00:30:05       Barring spar, two more rounds. That guy spar three rounds with another guy. He's hitting you in the face too, like you didn't stop. It was really dumb. He'd get hit and you get rocked and you didn't. Nobody likes sat you down and go, okay, let's take the day off. I know you get right back in there, man. You're fucking legs would go bang. Let your legs would go. When you cover up and you know people be throwing bombs on you and you'd next day sparring again. Can you. Is there a way to detect it? Like at your brain scan? So there are ways now. There's better ways now, but I had a limited amount of it. I mean, I had the real getting wrapped in the head for me came when I tried to transition from taekwondo to kick boxing or doing taekwondo. I got it. I definitely got hit in the head for sure, but I didn't get hit in the head as much because it's hard to kick people in the head.

Speaker 1:          00:30:52       You definitely get hit. I mean, I don't know how many times I definitely got hit, but I never got knocked out from a head kick butt. I got knocked out from punches before at least Tko Tko. But when when a punch hits your face, it's like your, your legs go. Everything shuts off. Like if you get rocked and you, you see like a person go down. It's not that they go down like, oh, so much pain. I have to go down. No, you get hit and everything shuts off. It just goes better. And then you feel your legs like rubbery. Trying to stand back up. Did you just watch the last UFC where Edson Barboza head kick. Kevin Lee. See that spinning wheel kicked him and you see Kevin Lee's legs just go blank. They just gave out for a second and then he came back and those those ones I got way more when I was boxing. She got way more of those like I was. I was not good at boxing. When I first got into boxing, I was learning. I was good at taekwondo, but then I got into boxing. I was not good at it. I didn't know what I was doing. I didn't understand the distance. Taekwondo, you didn't punch in the face and we punched the body so you had a real distorted perception of how good you were with your hands. And then once I started boxing I was like, Ooh, this is terrible.

Speaker 1:          00:32:04       That's what I was taking like probably the most damage of my life of a period of like two years of like a lot of sparring, did a lot of sparring. Everybody's sparred everybody's bar with everybody. People knocked people out all the time. This is stupid. So stupid. I see guys get knocked out. I mean out cold, right hand to the chin, boom. Eyes rolled behind their head. Legs give out, they bounce off the canvas, they put a cold towel on him, they put some ice on his head. He gets out and he's like, I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. You want to keep going? Yeah, let's keep going. Let's keep going. Now you would just unconscious you just unconscious five minutes ago and you want to keep spar and this is crazy. And they let him, they let him keep spar. You did it from when you were like really young, right.

Speaker 1:          00:32:52       Taekwondo from when I was wide took karate classes when I was 14, but when I got super serious I was 15. I was like right at my before my sophomore year of high school. So like I got into it from the time I was in the uh, ninth grade as I was 14. Like that summer, like right after my birthday around is when I started getting into. So it was probably either 14 or just turning 15. Asked like was there a point you could tell where people actually could be able to knock people out and give that damage because there may be 14 year olds could knock you out a little time here. The thing about kicks is almost anybody can knock you out. It's really crazy. Like when you think of the amount of power that you have to have in your legs. Let's say if you decide to put a heavy backpack on like one of those outdoorsmen atlas trainers and put 90 pounds on, you could walk up flights of stairs.

Speaker 1:          00:33:46       Dude, just think of how much power that is in your legs. You could throw your body up, flights of stairs for exercise just to boost your body is whatever you way 1:50, 200, whatever you way your body's just launching that through the air over and over and over again. Even if you're a girl that weighs 135 pounds, you're still launching 135 pounds through the air, and if that girl fucking shins, you both hang right on your temple. It goes across the jaw temple area. Got Blind, your legs are going to give out, your brain's going to shut off if somebody hits you. Perfect. There's a video of A. I think the guy was she, I think it was, I think it was mighty Mo. Mighty mo, who's this huge kickboxer I believe he was samoan and I mean just like typical simone dude, big giant fucking powerhouse of a dude. And he fought his little thai guy. This thai guy was 175 pounds, so Much smaller than them. I mean it was crazy to watch and tie guys just we went away and moving away and moving away. And then the thai guy roundhouse kicks hiM in the head. This guy like, look at the difference in size.

Speaker 1:          00:35:02       Yeah. And watch this. This dude just comes over the top. I mean the difference between the two of them. Mighty mo is a beast to seriously dangerous knockout puncher. He put a lot of guys to sleep, so not as this guy in there with someone way bigger than him, but he's in there with a killer. But look at that one head kick and mighty most down and out. The back that up again because that is a crazy thing to watch. You're talking about a guy who might have been a hundred pounds lighter than him and mighty mole. It's just a vicious puncher. Bang. You just clanged them right in the head. That's what I'm talking about. Girl. Does that to you? Night night son. I was thinking more like 2:10 year olds like no, knock each other out. That's a good point because the thought process is that if you teach kids technique, don't teach them.

Speaker 1:          00:35:49       They just go in these wild fucking haymaker exchanges, but teach them how to do it correctly. It's good to do it when they're young because they don't hurt each other because they have little tiny arms and they just kind of touch each other and they can't really generate knockout power. They just sort of. If they learn how to do that from the beginning and then develop knockout power and the pads and on the bag, then you develop much more technically proficient fighters rather than brawlers. So the problem with fighting is like most people don't fight to the physical ability of their body. Like they, they just, they decide they're going to knock thiS guy out, I'm gonna try to hit him with this and they think in this real limited sort of linear, aggressive, like almost obvious manner. and then you got guys who see past that who take thIngs to a new place.

Speaker 1:          00:36:37       You got guys who, who figure out that you can be like really elusive and confusing and then you see those guys fight like limited blocky, like obvious fighters. and like anderson silva and his prime is a perfect example that anderson was an artist. I mean he would just, he would, you didn't know what he was going to do. Its study you. He'd be moving around, maybe be standing in front of you. He'd be dancing. He just be following you around. And then all of a sudden he just say, I got this motherfucker figured out. He would just move in on your bank and you didn't know what was coming. Flying knee. You didn't know what was coming. Roundhouse kick front kick to the face. He didn't know what the fuck was coming, man. It was a totally different kind of fighter, so the difference between that and a guy was just like a powerhouse of a person and can knock guys out, but never, never achieves this sort of mastery of space and distance.

Speaker 1:          00:37:30       They win fights through brawling and power and just kinetic brute force rather than artistry and avoidance and countering like conor mcgregor, one knocked out josé aldo. Perfect example. All those like fuck you charge and connor slides back, bop drops a fucking left hand on the button, pop up and he's the champ champ. I mean, come on champ. Then became the champ champ champion that, that, you know, that thing is, it's hard to figure out. Sometimes guys just decided to it rather bite down your mouthpiece and let the fucking chips flying. It's not fun as part of that and have a fight just like the last 30 seconds, 30 seconds, and I just throw it out like crazy because they know there's no more time left. Yeah, they just try to. When I try to try to stop it. Yeah, some of those fights are awesome.

Speaker 1:          00:38:19       Look as a, as a person watching those things are awesome. There's two different parts. The way I look at fights, like I love a good diego sanchez, gilbert melendez fight where they just fucking go crazy for three rounds. I loved that. ThAt was one of my favorite fights ever, but I also love real technical fights where I see, I see like two artists trying to solve each other's riddle, trying to figure each other out. You know, like luke rockhold versus yoel romero. Was that like yolo? Just trying to figure him out, trying to figure him out. Maybe I move like this and then boom drops that left hand on them. Same thing with him versus chris weidman. He just moving around. It's hard to figure out what he's going to do. Hard to figure out what's coming and then wome flying knee To the chin or to the head.

Speaker 1:          00:39:06       He's a. He's a great example of a guy just figures out how to break your rhythm and figure it through rather than just running a. Because clash, clash, clash. You know, frank mir was jusT talking about that fate or fight and he was saying That his ego got the best of them. Did you see the fight? It's really good. Fight really crazy until feta or keto them fade or cut on with the lefthand and dropped it and put them away. But before fate or k owed him, frank mir had hit fate or and it got interesting in the very beginning seconds of the fight, but then fate or hit him with a perfectly timed hip throw, just fucking boom. I mean sent him flying through the air and slammed him to the ground. And apparently frank said from that moment on his ego got the best of me trying to get them back and then he wound up just getting this crazy brawl and getting knocked out.

Speaker 1:          00:39:54       It's really fighting to me. So it's so interesting. You know, it's just so interesting when you see all the different things that people can do and how they're going to match up together and how, what one person's going to be able to figure out how to get their, their ideas through my ideas. I want to kick this motherfucker in the head. How can I do this? I've got to figure out how to get there and his ideas. I want to take this guy down and punch his fucking face in. How do I figure out how to do this? And then the two of them are just like trying each other's strat and you don't really know. You don't fucking know. You don't know until they get in there. For the most part its greatest shit ever.

Speaker 2:          00:40:26       Have they with the judging? Have they ever tried like I'm sharing in between rounds what the scores are so you don't have to guess it was through rocks that those people. What if they don't say who it is or they don't have to be a bad idea? They killed them all just by being associated. What if they weren't there? What if they're like in the back room or oh, that's even worse. Why aren't you there? Maybe the judging would be better if they were there. They have to be there in person judging. They're actually elevated. They're a little higher than everybody else too. They're looking at it like above me because it would have like when there's a, when the accident happening on the other side of the octagon, you can't see anything, so I know they didn't get a monitor, but like if they should, what's the point being we can't. We gotta make sure they got monitors. They didn't get monitors in the beginning. In the olden days they didn't have monitors and I, I was going crazy. I was like, how is it that I, a person who has no effect whatsoever on the score of this fight? I have a monitor I can ask for for replay.

Speaker 1:          00:41:20       I have all this shit at my disposal. I have, I have earphones on with a microphone and I could press the truck. I go, can I see that again? And they'll show it to me on the screen. LIke guys, his ankle broke and so the production, like sometimes during a fight we'll tell them, hey joe, we got head, but it was a head but that caused that cut. And then I'll say, okay, I'm just hearing from the truck now that it was a head button. We're going to show you that as soon as we can, but I'm watching it on the screen right there. Why can't the judges get that? How long ago did that change? It seems like they should have been in table one. It wasn't that long ago. Wow. I don't think the judges have access to replays though. They can't call up a replay like I can.

Speaker 4:          00:41:52       Why not? They shouldn't be able to. Should be able to have a little bit too much time to judge or think about it or

Speaker 1:          00:41:57       no, you need to know things. You need to know things. Like if a guy gets kicked in the balls, was that a real kick in the balls?

Speaker 4:          00:42:01       Watch after the after the fact because I just said you don't want their attention taken from what's going on. The action depends on replay.

Speaker 1:          00:42:08       Depends. Yeah. I mean I think it should just be an option for something's up. Like what happened there? Did he get rocked or did he fall on his ankle? You know what I'm saying? Like what happened there? And there's only one way to tell. Sometimes you got to see it again because he that again, please. They should be able to say, can I see that again, please? That would be as I said, yeah. Well they. They have instant replays now, which is interesting. Like say if a guy pokes the guy in the eye and the judge wants to call for an instant replay, but once they instituted the instant replay in some states the fight is over. That's so great. That doesn't make any sense. So if I say no instant replay, I'll just take this. I poke and keep fighting. That's okay, but if you want to look at it on video, the fights over what?

Speaker 4:          00:42:50       I compare it to the mba, which I watch a lot, they go to the replay a lot, which is a little annoying as a viewer, but they're. They're trying to get it right, which they have a team of people in New York where they're watching all the. All the angles. They can pull up anything they want. They can see anything that they take as much time as they need to. Sometimes it takes five minutes, but why not do that with fighting? They get it right. You know? Common sense. Why doesn't that exist?

Speaker 1:          00:43:10       It should definitely exist and I mean we talked about it with Michael Chandler yesterday. There should be more. Judges. Definitely shouldn't be. Only three judges. That's. It's ridiculous. It doesn't make any sense. There's no reason to limit it to three judges. I bet you would get far more competent, far more knowledgeable judges for free than you would even if you paid them. Just pull up their fucking twitter cap, blow the twitter account up. They'll judge you for free to so many mma fans out there that would love to judge fights and they actually understand fighting. They really get it and they love it. They're not just doing it because it's a job and they used to do boxing and you know this is a good way to make 1500 bucks on a saturday night or whatever they met. That's not what they're doing it because they actually love it.

Speaker 1:          00:43:52       So many people, but do it. It will be way better. You can definitely judge from home too. We could definitely should have, I mean why not have like an online scorecard as well? Like why not have that as an option so the ufc could let everybody know how bad the judges are. I mean I'm not saying that everybody online is going to know what the fuck they're talking about, but enough people online you going to know what they're talking about where it'll balance out. So if you had just like 10 judges and then the online judges have an online store

Speaker 4:          00:44:25       work card. If you pay for five pasture where you probably are willing to have some knowledge on the sport, but also it put it in the app.

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       Say like conor fight unknown ob, you know, they're all the conor fans are going to vote for him anyway. Balance out because unknown bob will probably have some fans too and then people will be a bunch of haters. They're hoping that connor failed because he's got a limousine and bypass. You got paid for your vote. In that case, you want to pay 10 bucks every time. Yeah, exactly. Will you. If you had an app, you have a ufc app and the app, all it has to do, they just make it so it's interactive. So with each fight, after the fights over, you click winner or loser, you know that's all you have to do just quick winter and you. If you are optional, you could put in your own score, but the fuck out of here, the scoring sucks anyway. That 10 point must system stupid.

Speaker 3:          00:45:12       It's, it's a borrowed system. It's not a good system for all those weapons. It's a good system for two, two weapons, punches, kicks and knees and elbows, chokes, takedowns defense. You've got slams and throws and come on, we'll kicks and spinning back kick. What's better? Spinning back kick or a jab in boxing is a punch or a punch. Like that punch was harder than that punch, but unless someone's kicking you in the leg, you don't even know what that feels like. You have no idea. Guys just walking around like nothing happened. You can't score that. If nobody's ever kicked you in the legs, they should have a full body suit that detects punches and that like how strong it is within. It takes away from the fucking. The rawness of it all. You can't have people fighting in body suits. One of the future. It will look like you don't have anything on.

Speaker 3:          00:46:03       A lot of gals have to where the weather is something that covers their midsection, right? They have like a sports bra strap down, sort of jammy and they wear something that covers her midsection to. That's interesting. Like they have to have their stomach covered or they're allowed to have their stomach covered just to keep their boobs and check like everybody got to stay in the party. Can't fuck up those titties. Cats and gone. We'll be on soon. She'll explain it to us because she had a wardrobe malfunction. One of her fights. Really just a little snip at the docs can skip steps in that funny. Every dude shows his nipple every due to fights shows his nipple girl goes out and shows her nipple. Everybody goes crazy. It's funny. Twitch, twitch won't even let a grown man take off his shirt stand. Keep your clothes on.

Speaker 3:          00:46:54       You freak. People are always like, why don't you broadcast on twitch? Because I, if I can get banned for just showing a nipple. What else? I mean, anything a man can get banned. Like bert kreischer, if he tried to do the berg cast on twitch, which it immediately be a band. He could maybe talk to them and they might be able to. But most people, yeah, it's against the guidelines to show skin looks a lot of those things. That's the only problem with twitter that you forget. It's made for babies. So silly. You can't show man boobs. Yeah, it's pretty readable. You're super flat chested with you take your shirt off and you just smooth. I just don't want people taking their shirts off there. Okay. what if you take your shirt off and you have like pastries on.

Speaker 5:          00:47:36       I do have people that do body paint, so there is a little bit of

Speaker 3:          00:47:41       body paints. Okay. So if you decide to do like, um, the british flag, paint that over your body, that's okay. But you just can't be no paint

Speaker 5:          00:47:52       strip clubs in columbus, Ohio. The ones that serve alcohol, they can't even show their tits. They have to paste all these days, but they have pastries that look like better areolas, you know? Oh, I'm going to have these nice darker ones

Speaker 3:          00:48:03       like fake patients. Whoa. Wow. That's sick body pains. Pretty cool when it's done. Right. That is incredible. That's really good. Go back to that again.

Speaker 6:          00:48:16       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:48:17       that's neat. There's a couple of them missing this. She's doing this character on the side here. Right. But that's all her really. I'm pretty sure. Wow. Well, she's definitely got some kind of a boob pad going on. Wow, that's amazing. Some people are really good tour self.

Speaker 5:          00:48:36       Have you ever seen the girl I saw on instagram where she will like, will paint her eyes like up here and then have like a fake nose and a fake mouth and it looks like a completely different face and then she opens her realize you're like, well that's that.

Speaker 3:          00:48:48       That's her name though. Yeah. This is basically you're looking at naked boobs. They're just got paint on them. So we let it slide. So is this this girl's thing? She just gets her boobs painted and it goes onto. Oh my god, she does. That's her thing. That is hilarious. That's great. That's a way that you could see the whole thing. Girls are trying to figure out this dress. It's just not tight enough. It's not revealing enough.

Speaker 5:          00:49:12       There were some girls that were playing games on twitch just in like a bikini or whatnot and they got in trouble for that. So they hAd to take their scheme over to youtube or some other sites.

Speaker 3:          00:49:20       How long before someone comes up with a nontoxic paint that girls can paint all over their body and it's like a thin nylon layer and they'll go ouT and you'll see everything. So you know there's going to be a few girls that just go for it. Like this deadpool here, naked deadpool girl. Like how there's going to be girls like that that just go for it.

Speaker 5:          00:49:43       My favorite is if you google a twitch girl desert, realize camera's still on after show and masturbates. Is it telling you got busted, fallen for that? Come on, you have all thought looked really real. You just, you just dream real. You it to be real. That's ridiculous. Call bullshit on every call. Bullshit. So it's like a well known girl that did it. No. Right.

Speaker 3:          00:50:12       Direct you on instagram. What's your name? Mary? Nine zero four five. And did you say hello dear?

Speaker 5:          00:50:17       Well, no, I mean look, there was no reason why it was like a bad, like she was half off the camera. Like it looked like it wasn't that her sister would do it. If I was going to fake something, wouldn't you figure it out? Right? Come on son. How dare you? Just sad, sad that you got roped into that. I feel less of, you know, iT's the first time it's happened, joe. I, there's so many scams is too easy to get the new one. I almost got scammed the other day. They do want, I don't know what's going on lately with a robo calls, but I'm, I'm getting a call almost every day. like this is the iris. We are, you need to contact us now. And, or this is a t and t you need to, uh, we need to talk to you about your billing.

Speaker 5:          00:51:01       Please enter your credit card info right now. You'd like, did they call you when you're high? Nonstop? No, but, uh, it, it's interesting because, uh, like I think t mobile does it. How does your phone come up now? It just a scam. Likely like t mobile is now filtering out these calls and it's telling me if it's a scam like him. Yeah, I like that. Are you going gonna be cool and say murder spray that, uh, as the rest of the world that sort of gets online. Like for instance, like parts of africa that aren't online now will be online eventually that the scams will switch back. Like the nigerian prince scam will be american scamming. People in africa just get on because they don't know about the scams yet because they haven't been a part of it.

Speaker 1:          00:51:40       Oh my god. I don't know if that really happened with that. Like some theories, that's not a bad theory, but those people were really good at scamming lonely people. There was such a sad show I was watching once about this old guy, I think the guy's daughter was like trying to like tell him that this girl wasn't real and he kept going to england for. We went to europe twice, um, to meet her and both times something came up and she couldn't meet him. Then he went back again and he keeps sending her money. He's been sending her money, sent her, I want to say like a quarter million dollars. And his daughter was like, it's not written. You could see the guy like, like they're filming them and talking to him and he had this look in his eye like he was hoping the wrong, but thinking they might be right. Like he was going insane. He was going insane from loneliness.

Speaker 5:          00:52:26       Sad. I see it everyday on the web cam sites. There's guys that every single day I go there, the same guys there and he's spending money nonstop all day long and he's just on there all day. He might spend like thousands of dollars a day.

Speaker 1:          00:52:39       How billion dollar internet scam is breaking hearts and bank accounts, criminal networks, defraud, lonely people around the world with false promises of love and romance. You know, you could analyze this from a lot of ways, like it's predatory behavior. I caught a coYote in my yard last night was predatory behavior, right? It's going to have human coyotes. You're Always going to. I didn't catch him, catch him, catch him. I just chased them out of my yard to try and get my chickens. But this is a predatory behavior on a weak person, you know, so I can see it's on one hand I feel upset that they would go after these people, these lonely people. But on the other hand that's fascinating to me was like, what a drug people's love is what a drug that is like how important it is that people like find people that care about them, that like them and care about them. IT's so important when you don't have that in your life, you just feel so empty and it's one of probably the most major sources of like bad feelings in people, so they just don't have anybody that loves them. They don't get what good friends, they don't have, they don't have good people around them and they just sad. Just sad to the point where someone comes along, we can help you.

Speaker 1:          00:54:08       Come on, come over here. We've got girls. Girls would want to meet you. Curls in your town, girls sign up. You can meet girls like rules, you know? It's like someone, someone offering you food. Facebook's new online dating service won't have ads. I thought that said won't have

Speaker 5:          00:54:29       aids, aids and that's what I said. It was like, what the fuck are they saying? It sounds like that'll take advantage of what you're talking about right now.

Speaker 1:          00:54:37       Online dating service won't have ads so. But it will have russians all russians all the time. Well, I mean it'd be nice if people could just meet people in the real world. ThIs meeting people online stuff.

Speaker 5:          00:54:55       It's so weird how, like I talked to people that use tinder, they hooked up on tinder like weekly and there's a lot of these people that that's all they do. They'll just fuck people on tinder all day. It just makes you wonder how many people just do that. Like all data women and she's already been fucked like seven times for the same app. You know, like all these people are just like, they're just like, you're taking extreme risks. Yeah. With your bed. there was, there was the

Speaker 1:          00:55:23       second thing where they wanted to do online dating apps. Like someone was saying, should online dating apps be responsible for the increase in sexually transmitted diseases? Should they be responsible? Like as if they have some obligation to tell you to wear rubber. Oh fucking stupid. That is like soMe, they have some obligation. They're like, you know, like look, you know, these poor little children are go fucking. He needed to tell them they need to protect theMselves. Like these adults wrote adults using an app. Tinder and grindr don't want to talk about their role in rising stds. Good. Why do you want to talk to them? You muck raking piece of shit.

Speaker 1:          00:56:08       They don't have a role. They connect people together. People make their own decisions. You've got to be responsible for your own actions, especially when it comes to something like that. That's crazy. And you know, the other part is like the demonization of sex is a part of this, or what about tinder and grindr? What are you doing here? All these people is just having sex and getting stds. you're responsible. What about your part? What about your role? Your kid out outta here. That's ridiculous. That's ridiculous. Do bars have a role in liver sclerosis? Should they pay people out? Should they be financially responsible? They're literally selling you the shit that kills you and they have zero responsibility as long as they don't serve you while you're drunk and driving along as they cut you off in time and said, hey, you got to drag. We cut him off.

Speaker 1:          00:56:54       Alright, sounds drug. They literally sell you the stuff that does it to you and no one cares as they should. No one should care. You're fucking grown adult. Does grindr, those dudes banging each other all day? Do you think that anyone's going to stop that? Oh, I shouldn't connect these people. You should make money connecting them. You shouldn't give them the opportunity to do exactly what they want as grown adults with a limited about of time on earth. Get 90 years. If you're lucky, if you want to spend 45 of tHem raw dog and dudes, you go, you go boy, who gives a shit? Are they respond? They don't want to talk about their responsibilities. Shut the fuck up babies now. That very upset about something that was new to me, especially grinder now that backpage has closed, like all these websites are closing. It's very interesting to see what happens next where people are going to find their hookups and stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:57:53       Well, yeah. That was what I was reading this thing where sex workers are in danger because of this, because before they used to be able to vet customers and then customers would have like a record of using other sex workers and they could know who the psychos were, who to avoid. You know what I mean? And they could also screened people like actively screen. They could do, they could do all this. they were saying, I was reading an article about it where this girl who remember if they gave her name out or not, but she was. She worked in a brothel and she was talking about it and it's like, what? Why are they doing this? Like is there, is it because of a crime? what's the crime? So if they get together like through tinder or grindr, that's fine because that's two people that decided to have sex, but as long as they're grown adults and one person just wants to get paid and the other person's like, well I'll pay you.

Speaker 1:          00:58:48       And they go, okay, fine. Like what? Why is that illegal? Like we're not talking about sex trafficking for children. We're not talking about slavery. Were just talking about just let's just look at it from the cleanest perspective. Possible grown adult who likes sex, decides she wants to work in a brothel. Is that possible? Is it possible for you to do that? Like for it to be a grown adult who actually enjoys it? Does have any problem with it decides that it's better than working at wendy's? Isn't that? Is that possible? I mean, the people don't want to say it. Nobody wants to say that it's possible. Nobody wants to ever look at it that way. The war on sex workers needs to stop now. Rolling stone.

Speaker 7:          00:59:26       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:59:31       It's. It just seems like a dumb thing to chase down. I mean, I think if people want to have sex with each other, nobody has a problem with it, but if people want to pay people to have sex, then it's a problem. That seems so crazy. Again, we're not talking about child slavery. We're not talking about sex slaves. We're not talking about anything against anybody's will. We're just talking about people who would choose to do that. Like why not? And I've always used this example, but it's a good example. Why? Why is it okay for me to get a massage? it's okay for me to pay someone to give me pleasure all over my body except my genitals. Like they could ruB my neck and my feet. They can get it all. All been my feet, man. They get those thumbs and start working your feet. Uh, they crack your toe pop. Pop. It feels great. That's fine, but they can't jerk you off. They jerked you off. That'd be a terrible sin against god. And man, if they touched your penis, which feels really good when you touch it, can't do that. I know a dude who said he gets asked whole massages.

Speaker 5:          01:00:35       Yeah. That actually happens all the time to be terrier of your asshole. They massage the interior of your asshole. That's okay because it's just a massage. Prostate massage with weird is when they do it and they don't ask you because there's a lot of massage. People just do it. That's a part of the massage and they just started. Yep. No, no, no. I don't want that.

Speaker 1:          01:00:55       Apparently some people get it, whether they use a tool and they actually go in side. Your ass hole rubbed down. No, no, no. That's that tool. The other one, you're fis, fis, they use some sort of a thing to fucking check your, but that's okay. That's fine. That's fine. Just don't touch the dick. If you touch the dick, it's goddamn crime. They're waiting outside the door with a pistol. you just let me know when he touches the dick. He's just rubbing his asshole. Check the books, so. All right. Oh, it's not even hard. Okay. Okay. we're ready. We're ready. We're going to break it. This fucking shady place. Soon as we find out that he's dick touched like you could get someone to just massage your asshole. JusT get in there with squeeze your butt cheeks and get two thumbs in your ass on. Am I doing? I'm doing a sphincter massage. It's very important to release some of the shock rose and negative energy and, and, and some of the toxins that are stored in your body from processed foods and a modern lifestyle. So we're just going into your asshole. But to dump some guru talked people into filming them in the ass.

Speaker 5:          01:02:03       So weird that I've never. Like I just recently found out all that shit that's happening in massage parlors, but like, you know, 10 years ago I had no clue. I would go buy a massage part and go, oh, that's of massages. There's nothing bad going on here. I wonder how many places like that are like, like psychics, what happens at psychics at four in the

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       morning? Why are they open at four in the morning? Because that where you get your ass eat and out and I. You don't learn about that until you're 70 or something. I don't think so. Think psychics are open late at night because a, it's a scam and be when people are, it's late at night. They're drunk and like maybe it's the girls driving home. The guy texted her and she doesn't know. Should I text him back? Why is he texted me so late? That's kind of disrespectful. I don't know if he's the one that she pulls into that psychic's office and she's like, I just need you to tell me about my future and the psychic because like I sense there's a problem and romantic interest. My boyfriend. Yes. Yes. There's your stressed. There's something deeply troubling you. Your,

Speaker 1:          01:03:06       you're confused. I am confused. Yes. You're confused. You trying to the decisions hard to something coming up. Something's happening. Can you ask me to come over to the house and fuck it? Yes. That's it. There's a thing that he's wanting you to do. The. You're not so sure if he's the one. Is that a yes? Oh my god. That's what I said when I was on the way over here. And then when he said, you're not sure if he's the one. I'm like, oh my fucking god. Is it like written on my forehead? How's it possible? He knows. He fucking knew about mark. He knew about our relationship problems and he knew that I was on my way over there wondering whether or not he's the one.

Speaker 2:          01:03:47       Yeah, I don't think he's still. I think you're my favorite girl voice guy. You know, like I,

Speaker 8:          01:03:59       you fucking asshole and all this bullshit with. I'm trying to figure out how this fucking psychic knows the one for me. Who does this?

Speaker 1:          01:04:14       No, she, no

Speaker 2:          01:04:18       friend of mine went to one. It's like he knew my grandmother's home. Everything about my relationship. My grandmother. I go, don't you know,

Speaker 1:          01:04:25       don't you know everything about your relationship with your grandmother. What the fuck you want? Do you want to pay people to tell you shit you already knew it's 4:00, 4:00. You're fucking nuts. I'm wearing a watch.

Speaker 2:          01:04:35       Uh oh. My brains out. You get wet. Oh, this guy's crazy. tell me all this shit. I already knew. It's crazy. I bet. I bet it's psychics are way better now nowadays because of technology and like they probably have like little earpiece in, some guy in the back like looking at their license plate number online and finding out where they live, you know, like the and just feeding the person information. I bet psychic are killer now. I bet there's some probablY they're like super high scammy level because you want to repeat customer, so if you're that accurate habit, there's a huge scam that that is a crazy thing if you're driving, if you're driving to burbank or some shit every couple miles to see one of those psychic reader places. Five in the morning

Speaker 5:          01:05:18       open big hand on the front, like a hand job place. But it's a psychic.

Speaker 1:          01:05:22       I went to one once when I was in New York and I was going to these fucking stupid auditions. I did not want to act and I was going, I was just wasn't what I was interested in doing, but like your agency would tell you, well, you know, you really should look into this and you'll see what it was. It was like some role that not only was I not going to get it, but I want it like this is like, it's not even funny. It's like super serious. Yeah, but you should do it. So they just, they know, they know what. You could do commercials that go in and read for commercials and I'd be like, what the fuck am I doing? So I left one of them and I was terrible at it too. It was terrible auditioning. And then I went to this, um, I went to this psychic and I'm like, well, fuck it. Let's say it's only like, I don't remember how much it was, like five bucks, 10 bucks. She's like, you don't get along with your brothers. I go, I don't have any

Speaker 5:          01:06:13       brother's shit. I left her, you don't know anything like looked in her eyes and she looked at it,

Speaker 1:          01:06:22       me and I knew that. She knew that. I knew she was full of shit. I knew she was full of shit. I looked at her. I don't have any brothers. She was like, oh shit. I got crazy. She got gangster. She took a swing. Just like sensing brothers from this asshole could chip on the shoulder. Shoulder brothers probably beat them up. no, it came from a bad audition. You missed it.

Speaker 5:          01:06:45       It's weird how we all know it's bullshit for the most part. There may be some weirdo that actually can do some shit, but like, but we still accept it. People still go to it even though they know deep down like, hey, we have a gun to your head right now. Is this real? If you do the wrong answer, then we're going to blow your head off. Everyone's back. No, it's not real. Even the people that believe psychics the most are going to say, no, it's not real. What did you say? most likely if it comes to a bullet in the head, right, so like, but we still do it like or crystals. Oh no, these crystals are healing me. oh yeah. Gun to the head. Do you think they're really healing? Do you think this rock is healing? You know? No. You know, no one's goIng to say yes. Well here's the.

Speaker 1:          01:07:25       But those crystals, those magnet things and all that shit. That one weird thing is the placebo effect. Placebo effect is real. It's very real. Do you remember those holograms that people were wearing for awhile on those rubber bracelets? Yeah. Brody has like four of them. Dude. There was world class ufc fighters that were wearing those stupid fucking things like top of the food chain assassins and they were like, dude, I'm telling you. It's been helping my elbow. Like, what the fuck are you talking about? And I talked to one of the guys. Goldberg was wearing one for awhile. My buddy mike goldberg was wearing one. I was like, dude, I don't think that's real. I was like, you don't think I go, I don't think so. He's like, you want to meet with the guys who are making a girl? Okay. I met with the guys who make it and they try to do one of those a strength test things on you, like, here's what I want you to do.

Speaker 1:          01:08:14       I'm to. I'm going to put this rubber band on you. I want you to put your arms straight out and I'm going to push down on it, and they're like halfway push down. This is one of those things. It's like, okay, I'm trying to lift your arm up, and they're like, push down on your hand and then go, okay, now we'll put this rubber bracelet on you. Now try to lift your arm up like, wow, this is crazy. I can lift my arm up because you weren't holding it back. You're not a machine. Like you could regulate how much force you're putting a. Yeah, I know what you're doing. I go, this is a goddamn carnival trick. So I said to the guy, go, this is the goddamn carnival trick. And goldberg was like, is this fake? I, it's fake. It's fake. I go, what is this? I go, you tell me how this works. You have a piece of plastic, but you're telling me I'm going to put on a rubber band. It's going to make me stronger, dude. Okay. I didn't spend a lot of time in school, but I spent enough. Fuck you.

Speaker 5:          01:09:02       You can't do a hologram inside a hologram. Anyway. Life is a hologram. You can't. It's all hog. That's true. They don't even exist. That's true.

Speaker 1:          01:09:12       There's certain things that make you think it might be a hologram, right? Power scam. That's it. Power bounce. Admits the wristbands or scam or wait a minute. No way, bro. We admit that there's no credible scientific evidence that supports our claims and therefore we engage in misleading conduct. Yeah. I called that shit out in like 2001. I was like, what are you guys doing? Like what is this? Who's wearing that? Why you weren't? Why would you think that would work? They had to published that in australian media. Yeah, because Australia is fucking smarter than us because of their bogus claims and pseudo scientific mumbo jumbo, but this seems to be the first time in which a regulatory authority has made them admit their claims are simply a fraud derp look, there's some shit that makes you strong, but it's not a rubber band with a piece of plastic attached to it. It cbd oil, you know, I mean, you want something that makes you feel better. Cbd oils real well, trying to make that illegal.

Speaker 5:          01:10:13       There is some, uh, some people that say that there's no scientific proof that cbd, even eggs works at that. it's always, it's always the other ingredients that are mixed with the cbd, you know, like they'll take the same ingredients that's in bengay and then put cbd in it also. And they say, doesn't this feel numb now? Like there's a lot of, there's no real. I heard that there was no real concrete evidence that cbd because there's no test.

Speaker 1:          01:10:39       I thought there was evidence that a decreased inflammation. Isn't there evidence that a decreased inflammation? The problem is the scientific studies, all these things. It might be, I might be mind fucking myself when I put that stuff on. You might seem to work though, especially for my elbow tendinitis. I feel like it works. Finally getting over dude. I finally could do chin ups. I couldn't do champs for months. Months. Try years. Joe up with this. It'll help get cBd in it. Um, I, I really, I was, I was not doing chin ups or anything heavy. I was doing mostlY running and yoga for months because of this fucking elbow I've, I've never had tendinitis before. I've had muscle poles and stuff and injuries. I never had tendinitis this and this was a dumb one because I meet, headed my way through it. I need headed it into a bad place.

Speaker 1:          01:11:32       I go to like, don't be a pussy, just keep working out. And then it got real bad and then it until I did a bunch of different stuff to it. I did stem cells and regena keen, but the thing that helped them also this, this rubber thing. Oh, is that roller? No, it's not. It's called a, a therm. a band. I've Talked about this so many times that I can't therabands rather. I can't buy them on amazon anymore. People have bought them out, but I'm glad because they work. If you have a. It's cheap too. It's just, it's just a piece of rubber and if you don't have this and you have something that can do a similar exercise, it'll probably help too, but what you do is you twist it and then in the release,

Speaker 9:          01:12:09       hm.

Speaker 1:          01:12:10       Twisted. Yeah. You twist this thing and in the elite you like to twist it with your hand like this and then the release with the right hand, the right. My right elbow is one that was injured and just slowly letting it down. It works. This part of your arm. Oh, that's weird way. So even thouGh it's injured, it doesn't hurt it, but it strengthens it. That's great. It works a lot, so I'll just pick this fucker up and do it 10 times, 12 times, 15 times and do it several times a day and I made a big difference man. Like right away I coulD feel it just. It feels like everything around. It's like strengthened and stabilized and it just started feeling better because you're putting a load on it and then you make an it release the load instead of like pulling it in the direction that you injured it. You're, you're strengthening it in the, I guess would be the eccentric way. East centric. Essentra quit.

Speaker 3:          01:12:56       Hm. So there you go. Don't get tendinitis. Kids. I had recently from I think using cell phones too much and computers too much, like carpal tunnel to the point where my hand hurt. Like I think it's the same shit. It's repetitive stress. Yeah. Right. Secretaries get that right from a lot of typing and stuff. Hairstylists also get it a lot. Yeah. Um, and I know a tattoo artist and has it. Yeah. And it right now just me even saying it, I'm like, it's still actually really sore. My hands go to guys who get it in their risk too. And um, you know, for a lot of those guys they start getting addicted to antiinflammatories and know different things to try. Because if you have to use your fingers for work, imagine if you had to do something with your hands like that for work and you started feeling that pain. Like this is just my elbow, you know? I meaN I can do pretty much everything. But your hands, like if it's in your hands, fuck, that's a bitch.

Speaker 3:          01:13:49       I was reading this article about replacing body parts. They were talking about all the different body parts that are on the verge of being able to replace. He dId a face transplant, didn't they? They've done a few of those things. Yeah. Yeah. They did a few dick transplants. Cock and balls. Yep. here's the thing. If they can't do the balls, who wants the balls? You don't need them. But here's no. But here's the thing for ethical reasons, because the dead person's sperm will always be in those balls. So here's the thing. Say if you, if you took my balls, if I died and you took my balls and put them into your body and they started having kids, those would be my kids. They would have my genes. You can have my come inside of your body growing. You got, oh, you're going to make my own comp.

Speaker 3:          01:14:33       You could, but that's the crazy thing you could make. Jamie's come. Jamie died and he donated his cock and balls and you took his boy. Put in your body. You. He would grow your company. My company? Yes. Come. It's his. It's your balls. So it's your sperm and your come you your ges. Let's just call it tj's, but for scientific purposes, what happens if I have one of your balls and went to jamie's follows what happens. So I have a. We have a fucking crap shoot. Who the hell that kids can be? I have gay friends that took. They had a kid through a surrogate and they took their common. Just mixed it up like a swirly. I like. Let's see, let's see who wins the race. know they don't really. They don't really know who won the race. This cute kid. He's a great kid, but they don't know who won that race guard that they have their guests guesses.

Speaker 3:          01:15:21       I read there's a agender baby situation going on potentially with one of their bodyguards are still on the mom with the most recent kid is an obama at the baby daddy is saying, you need to get it checked because he's a famous rapper. Looks like his bodyguard. Oh shiT. I bet those bodyguards get in there. Of course they do. They probably ripped. Yeah, wasn't there a big thing about kylie? she has a sexy bodyguard. Dude. Looks so you send it. God damn Bruce Lee movie, right? They all have to sleep with the body. What are you talking about? You have this guy that's just works out all the time. Some bastard. Kelly. Jamie's bodyguard. cryptically responds to baby daddy rumors. Okay, I'm out. I can't do this anymore. I can't. Can't do it anymore. Can't do it anymore. he's a handsome fellow. that bodyguard. I wouldn't blame the gal happened before though currently. Hey, what are you going to do? Not that I'm. I don't know. What are you going to do? Would just like to remind everybody we're in space and Hawaii is exploding. Okay. If you really give a fuck, if you really give a fuck which bodyguard and who's getting the dick into, which poor, confused young lady, things are gonna happen that way, man. Things going to happen.

Speaker 4:          01:16:32       talking about those body parts. I was gonna ask if you heard about what happened to huey lewis recently.

Speaker 3:          01:16:37       I've been hearing these got some sort of inner ear infection.

Speaker 4:          01:16:39       he's got many years and he most recently, very recently he was on tour. I saw people that were like had been to his concerts, but he said he can hear people talking like he was doing an interview with the woman. He said, I can hear your voice, but I can't hear music. And like that's what he does is performed. It's pretty fucked up man. Like ears. Shit is really scary. My friend, he's an editor and one day he just woke up and he can't hear out of his left ear and he still to this day, 10 years later, it's still can't hear out of his left. You didn't happen to me. I'm pretty sure I have tonight. It's bad now.

Speaker 5:          01:17:10       Whoa. What's tinnitus ringing? That happens. I'm used to been a heavy metal band, so like I never wore earplugs and gone to tons of concerts for like five plus years every other night. Like the cameras down. That's like. Yeah. Yeah, just to see. Occasionally just go real high and I like, I can't hear anything out of that year and it's sort of like plug it up or do something and it'll go away eventually, but some more recently it's taken a little longer to go away. I have that sometimes it's usually when it's really quiet and I'll just come out of nowhere. I hear this like ringing, but it's not like every day. Yeah, that's what it is though. It's called the. Yeah. How do you get it? It's just an old too. It's just hearing loss, hearing loss

Speaker 3:          01:17:47       be. You've heard loud things, you've been the concerts over the years that damage, but the real thing I think is people around guns a lot. I know a lot of people who are around guns a lot as a kid, like they shot those clays with shotguns and shoot those. John dudley has real bad hearing loss from that. Nobody ever Told kids back then that they need to wear ear muffs, like nobody wore ear protection. They would go to the range with just no earmuffs on,

Speaker 5:          01:18:14       bang, bang, bang concerts. I don't think I had growing up. I ever even thought of that. Like I would sit right next to the speaker on purpose. Like I had a nine inch nail concert just because like, oh man, you know, you're no one talked about that. in fact, that's true

Speaker 3:          01:18:28       nicholas. Wow, that's crazy. You see if you can find video of them in a gun range with no ear protection because I don't think I'm making that up. I think I remember look watching people on a range to shooting guns with no earplugs

Speaker 5:          01:18:47       nowadays. It doesn't matter that because their hearing aids nowadays, it's like you have earbuds in now and you get bluetooth to your phone and everything. It's cool. I want to hear hearing aids.

Speaker 3:          01:18:58       Well, they have those things called game ears. You can put them in your hearing in your ear canal rather like a hearing aid and they amplify sounds extraordinarily. And hunters use them in the woods. They put them in and you can see the column game is, I think it's called a walker. His game here. I put it on before it freaked me out. Took it right off. That's crazy. I don't even want to hear this.

Speaker 5:          01:19:21       You're looking for. Exactly, but this guy is trying to tell people how to do it and he was just plugging up as here.

Speaker 3:          01:19:25       Oh yeah. That's not what I'm looking for. I'm looking for like old school, so this shoot guns. If I don't have ear protection, I just put some articles to people discussing it, but nothing's really. Maybe I imagined it, but I remember seeing like an old school range, some dude with a pistol with like a thick belt like lowe's. Hippies used to wearing a belt buckle and he's firing off that gun. Boom, boom, boom, boom.

Speaker 5:          01:19:56       I think the first time I shot a gun I didn't have headphones or ear thing. Protecting a lot of people. It's a bad idea.

Speaker 3:          01:20:02       This does. Those guys don't know what your protection. He gets up and he was lIke, because he has a concussion.

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       Catch his breath. It's so dumb. Do you know how powerful these things are? This is how powerful of 50 calibers somebody decided. that's the 30 caliber. Somebody decided to try to hunt deer with this. So there's a video. You could find it online. Guy mrs dear, and the deer's head exploded as it missed. The eyes popped out of his head. He thought it was a perfect headshot because the deer just went down, but what it actually was was that the bullet passing by had so much force it instantaneously killed the deer. That crazy. Dude. It's insane. It's insane. Here it goes. So this. So he does this and he's got this big ass fucking gun. It says 50 bmg. I don't know. What that means is that 50 calibers and what that means. So look at this. He goes over to the, to the deer and there's no bullet hole. It's just eyes had blown out of his fucking head. Just from the sheer force of that thing passing by it. Yeah. Look, you could see it like there's a slow motion of it. See it passes by. She doesn't even hit it and the deer just disappears into the night. That's nuts. Like imagine it has so much force. It can miss a deer and kill it. Whoa. That is so unnecessary. That is such a war weapon. Fucking. Amen. That's a crazy thing to go hunting with. Who

Speaker 5:          01:21:54       do you. Do you use uber a lot like. no, you never do. I don't. It's too risky. I'm starting to not trust and it's so weird. I use it all the time. I use delivery, serve food delivery services all the time and I'm having second thoughts on the whole thing. I think it's great. I think uber's great.

Speaker 1:          01:22:15       I'm just fucking around with saying it's risky. I mean the idea that you could just call a cab like, okay, how come I can't just call an uber? The only argument would be that they don't screen the people as well as the cab companies.

Speaker 5:          01:22:27       Exactly. That's regulated. Right, right. Which is why people like limos though. They prefer limos, you know? I mean, I was in one recently. That kid was probably. He seemed like he was like 17. like I said, I had no way this is my dryer and I felt like he was drunk, like capital, how do I get outta here? You know, like run a highway right now. I can't just tell him to pull over on the side of the highway, but I feel like he's going to kill me, you know?

Speaker 1:          01:22:53       Well, there was a lady recently that went on this whole tweet thread. She, she tweeted a bunch of different things to uber about. A guy was an uber or was it lift one of those where a guy had taken her under a bridge and wouldn't, wouldn't give her her stuff back and wouldn't let her out of the car and some passer by stopped and helped her and she was screaming at the guy and the guy took off, but it was to a point where she was like, is this guy going to rape me? Like, is this guy going to kill me? Like, is this how I'm going to end? Like I just jumped in the car with a stranger and now he's decided to stop somewhere and it's not. It's not where we're supposed to go. He's not telling me why. That's that kind of shit. Like I guess that could theoretically happen with any ride rideshare company, but with uber it's so weird. It's just a person just get some person to come get you and you don't have to be hired by a company. Right.

Speaker 5:          01:23:50       You never thought that with taxis though. Like you never thought like, you know, you always kind of like taxis were transportation. You never thought, oh this taxi drivers going rate me or something.

Speaker 1:          01:23:58       Right. Well especially in la are the only time I usually take taxis is in New York. New york is the place to taxis, right? Because it's everywhere. Yeah. And that's how people get around. It's like it's an easy way to get around, but you never know. I mean it's like a ride. Sometimes those people you'd get in the car, like it'd be like, whoa, this guy is just ryan and people's asses and cutting people off. It's slamming the brakes and honking the horn. I whoa. Like in this dude is tuned in. He's doing this all day. He's probably in this fucking car 10, 12 hours a day and so you don't expect that because you come from

Speaker 5:          01:24:32       columbus, Ohio. we're from columbus. WasTe. Still have mormons.

Speaker 1:          01:24:39       No amish. The amish. Do you still have the amish? Right. They're hit or miss with electricity still don't wear deodorant. Every time I go to New York and I get in the car and some new yorkers driving them, I was like, whoa, you guys are in the matrix. Like they dress drive so much more aggressively. Like you know, if you hire a car to drive you around in New York city, they drive so much more aggressively. They're just so used to it.

Speaker 5:          01:25:05       I just remember as a kid going to like wind dot lake and amusement parks. They always went as a group to amusement parks. So there's like 200 amish people mixed in with us and we'd be like 14, 13 and like look at those guys than the amish people always acted like so almost like alien, like, like the film the country and they talk weird and I don't really talk like us like, well they stated

Speaker 1:          01:25:28       to themselves, right. I mean, but I didn't know that they could go to amusement parks. I thought there the whole idea was that they can't use electronics. That might not have been. That could have been like a different group. There's different kinds of mennonites too, right? yeah. There's different kinds of. Quakers. Quakers. I was with [inaudible]. We were in Massachusetts, western Massachusetts. We, we stopped into this fucking truck, stopped to get gas and grabbed something to eat and there's a group of mennonites and there's some girl that's wearing this mennonite outfit and I forget how ari asked her. I really wish, but it was hilarious. It was something. Something along the lines of, so what you in

Speaker 3:          01:26:05       something along those lines, it might have been more tactful than that. Maybe it was something like, what's this all about? Why are you dressed like that? I think I remember. I think I was there. I think you were too. It was something along the lines of a group that you're with. Like it was something to the point where we were all of course baked out of our minds. Yeah. We're traveling. We're just trying to be silly. We just tried to have a good time. You know, I think diaz was with too. It wasn't me. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:26:35       This poor lady was in this weird cult. We're in this weird outfit and I think she answered politely and nice, like a. I'm in. She was like, yeah. He's like, okay. He's such an unique guy. Because he was a. As a child, he was raised to be a very, very strict orthodox jew. You know what I mean? He spent time, I forget what it's called when you go over to Israel and you just read the torah like fucking 10, 12 hours a day. He did that, all that stuff. He grew the curls. He had the little strings and hanging from his belt. He did all that smiths or something. What it's called. It's called orthodox, right. That's orthodox judaism. Yep. Yep. So when anybody tries to run any bullshit by ra and he's like, I know this. He knows all that stuff. He stabbed the weird curls to and all that stuff. He had all that shit. Yeah. And then he just realized as he got older and wiser, it's like, oh my god, this is all bullshit. Not that it is folks, this is just, sorry, don't take your word for it. But he's a, he's a funny guy with that stuff because like I think only someone who's truly seen it from the eyes of an absolute believer.

Speaker 3:          01:27:53       Imagine that he's gotten through so many weird looks. Remember when he just had like a, like he would always wear the small hats or something like that. Like small hats, memory. He had the remember he always had like the hat on that would just hang on the side of his head. And he, I think he had like his head shaped like a bald. He definitely shaved his head like a ball person for awhile. Did he grow up? Was that a like a mullet mohawk, mohawk there? He's an animal. He doesn't give a fuck that. Look. I like the mohawk look. Yeah. The um, the new thing is the no glasses. Look, you've got the lasiks done now. That's right. powerful vision. Now he could see he got an infected tony had to get it chopped off. What? He lied. He told me about that he got an infection on his big toe and he had to get.

Speaker 3:          01:28:40       Every move is really good for that. Is a kurt medsker because kurt metzger was in. Was he in the moonies or the christian? Jehovah's witness. Jehovah's witnesses. Yeah. I think you're right. Yeah, so he grew up in the jehovah's witness. So like he's like, I'm not buying any of this. Like I know where this is like why? Why do people like. It's the same thing with psychics, right? Like why do people have this need to hold onto irrational beliefs? Like there are some questions you don't have answers to. You know you don't have answers to. So why don't you pretend that this one, this, this answers can take its place. This answer, you kind of know bullshit. It's going to take its place. Why do we need to do that? Because so many of us do, and I'm not immune to it. We're all, we all need that feeling.

Speaker 3:          01:29:22       You know the to know still. It's going to be okay, brian, how everything's gonna be. Okay. It makes me wonder if you did the whole gun theory, if this is real or not to religion, how many people would say yes, it's all real and who would go? Even the most religious person would like. No, of course not. We on it. I like, it helps me out. Um, I think a bunch of people would take a bullet. If you want to punish me for my lord heaven, they'd take it right in the temple. Boom. Piles of people. Piles of bodies at walmart. Yeah, man. People would just blow their brains out for their heavenly father does command you to come see him in heaven. Boom. Yeah. Lot of people would do it. Guaranteed. But you know, man, it's like even what's going on with the pope just recently said, there's no hell.

Speaker 3:          01:30:13       Everybody went crazy. Like, what? What did he just sang? The pope said, there's no hell he's, he's slowly bracing you for the fact that all this is nonsense, but right now we're going to get rid of hell. Like this is like one of the, one of the purest examples of like the change in people's attitudes towards religious real. Yup. Yup. The vatican denies that. But yeah, the vatican did not say there is no hell we'll find out an article where it says he did say that 50 percent shit. He's not going to cut it back. Go back in time and find an article where he did say, I guarantee you. He did say, let's just assume at one day the. See this is what they do. They say it a little bit and then they take it back. So they get used to the idea that they're saying it.

Speaker 3:          01:30:58       That's what it is. I'm full eddie bravo right now for conspiracy. Dude. This is how they set it up. They start out with uh, uh, they tell you the hell's not real. Then they say, we never said that. And then a year from now they say, look, we're pretty sure hell is not real. This pope probably plays fortnight and shit. He's like, he's cool pope. He doesn't have the pope immobile. Scott is. Kanye is on. He's a cool pope. He is the cool pope. He got rid of the throne. Okay. Yeah. He had a big giant crazy ass thrown for the last guy. The creeper. He's got a gamer chair down those racing chairs. The headphoneS where I just got one of those. pope francis in the fucking house. Pope francis has no problem with gay people either. See pope francis fighting with your or kid. Yeah. see, look how he swapped. You look at the old, the old thrown versus the new throne. Look at the two side to side. The guy on the left guy, they just kicked out for crimes against humanity and the guy on the

Speaker 1:          01:31:59       right is the new guy who's just got a sensible chair much better. The other throne is creepy man. That is crazy. And he dresses much more conservatively two. He's not wearing crazy wizard robes. He's wearing like a one color wizard robe

Speaker 3:          01:32:16       dresses like r kelly on a sunday. Just crazy. Like if he came out and like a polo shirt and pair of jeans. No. Right? No. Everybody like, hey, you can't be the paul. Put out the fucking magic outfit. Where's your fish head hat? Come on, bro. He's got body armor on. He's got a hat on

Speaker 1:          01:32:36       golden salmon that's coming out of the top of his head. Like, show me that hat. This fucking hat. Sad is preposterous. That's a. That's like a monster. That's a mouth.

Speaker 3:          01:32:48       After I got like a, like a giant snake. It looks like a napkin at a restaurant. When you go there and it's sitting in. Oh well it's nicely done. Little rings. Probably put it on by mistake like he's just going look at me. I can't believe they're making fun of our holy father on this. Fucking show sucks. You'll make fun of our holy father. He's right there with the smoke.

Speaker 1:          01:33:14       Oh my god. How is this still legal? Look at these kids dressed up like they're in harry potter's seminary and build the life that they look good. They do. They look like they're go to that. What's that hogwarts school? They do. This is fucking ridiculous. Universal talking to this dude who's holding up a golden version of where the savior was murdered, right? He's got a golden cross. This crosses all over the place like don't forget about the cross and he standing there dressed like a wizard. This is craziness. And everybody's. No, no, no. This is our reLigion. This is our culture. This is weird. This is weird and I'm not saying it's not beautiful. It's absolutely beautiful. I'm not saying it's any weirder than going to the opera because I think that's weird too, but this shit is weird. This is some really old form of education slash entertainment that people used to do before they had plays.

Speaker 1:          01:34:04       They get together and some room. What's fucking crazy? Different colored glass windows in it. Doesn't have a mic on. Why did that kid got to hold the mic? Because jesus doesn't want him to be an magnified. That's a thick mic though. Yeah. Manager was pink. She had a pink mike. What's it? What's it buys? It have to be silver. I like pink, pink. Pink mic. It's a. It's crazy. You know, and it's a billion of us and I was raised there. I mean I was from when I was real little kid. I did at least one year in catholic school was around a lot of catholics, you know, and I'm not claiming to be an expert in it, but I don't have to be that shit's bananas. I used to be an altar server. I used still hold that mic. Did you really? Did you. Were you ever in the middle of doing that? Going what in the fuck am I doing? Not the. Most of the times

Speaker 4:          01:34:58       we did it and me and my friends talk about we would get out of class so we would, because I went to catholic school, there'd be services during the day and funerals even sometimes we get paid to be out of class and then we would like miss two, three hours of school was getting paid 20 bucks, get some donuts, miss lunch. Know that was really all we were doing.

Speaker 3:          01:35:14       I used to just have to light the candles like I me and this other kid would come out and lay all these candles. I always wanted to be the guy that puts them out with that bell on the hook. So bananas when you're in that room and they'll see those benches all laid out up to the pulpit like this is so crazy, this is. It's like people figured out some way to make the bridge between physical evolution and mental evolution. Like there's this bridge between us not being monkeys anymore, but still we just want to get out of the barbarian behavior. We've got to figure out a way to get people to like have reverence for something is all powerful and just control their behavior. We've got to slow down the chimp in a santa monkey like that. That's what it looks like. A monkey.

Speaker 3:          01:36:15       The monkey statue. The feast of the chair of st peter and address. What is the statue? It's just a bronze statue of st peter. I said this is a dark statue. Try to tell you. St peter was black truth. There's a. it's weird. When we were in charlottesville, the they had the black israelites there that were right out in front of the building that they used to set up shop all the time in New York to run into those dudes. Just wander down the street. I was told that because I'm italian, I'm not white. I said, oh yeah. He told me that. I was like, thank you. I know you are. I did see that. I did see that, but yet I'm certainly not black, so keep going. According to these black israelites, I am not white, so I'm okay.

Speaker 3:          01:37:06       The true nation, is that them? I love how they dress like mean. they take that whole pope shit to the next level. They're like, fuck, that man won't be like he mad master of the universe, the dress and it's crazy. Look at how they're dressing. They have shields and shit, bro. Go to that. Make that picture bigger. Please make that picture bigger. These are serious people there on the street. They're reading from the bible. One guy has a sword. Okay, this guy's got an ax. the other guys got to pick acts like he's going to go find gold. This is one of the craziest pictures of this is real. Is that real champion barrier? That's. Go back to that please. Jamie, go back to that police for a second. What did it say?

Speaker 3:          01:37:46       There was something in the. The text that went with it. So that it. Yeah, there it is. What does it say? Passover? Twelve. I sup k passover from wikipedia. So it looks like a mixed tape. What is the high holy day? Passover in harlem, New York. 20 12. Oh my god. So that's the black israelites at the high holy day. Passover. Black israelites who think there are different kinds of jus the dea so called jews that looks like fun. I'll do that. Doesn't look like fun until someone gets drunk. Start swinging an ax around. What do they got there? They're teaching white people stuff. They got these posters. Six, six, six. Preach on brother. Okay. The dress cool though. Look at that outfit. All leather. giant star. David duke has a sword. No big deal. Just two dudes walking around with a stored.

Speaker 3:          01:38:44       They're going to fucking like. It looks like a holiday inn or something. Right? It doesn't look like some sort of banquet center. When they have the sword show the picture of the sword. Where are they? Where the fuck is that going on? That seems like a very public place. That was sort, sir. What's that place you eat at and then they all looked like that. Their horse chow, evil man type places. Middle east. The times. Maybe two times. Yeah. I believe medieval manner was a place like that in boston. I think there's a few of those all over the. I never went to one of those either die. I'm just scared of the people that go to those things. Oh yeah, there is not. They were closed. I don't want to go to it. Well, isn't that renaissance fair thing going on right now? Yeah, that's.

Speaker 3:          01:39:25       I'd rather get that. That. That's hilarious. Yeah, it's kinda cool. I used to collect copper soldiers from. It's something fun. It's interesting. It was funny because one lady broke character, um, and she was complaining about her husband's medication and the other lady said, I do not understand this medication that you speak of. She stayed in her like, she was like, bitch, we're here making believe. I don't want to hear about. Your husband complained about his pills. Well, they've got them on this one thing and I don't know what that's for, but then this other thing is supposed to counteract this medication. It's like, mA'am, I do not understand if this medication or speak up for him just to winch. And I await the prince. Bizarre. Like you're not supposed to break character.

Speaker 10:         01:40:14       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:40:15       And these people like really get into it and then I bet they get drunk and fuck each other. Don't you think? I'm sure this must be a god damn crazy person's orgy. They all get together with their wacky outfits on phone each other and fake accents. My neighbors, when they fence in the backyard, why not? They look hot to go for a kid's jam. pretty people. Why not? Right? Why not? Why not? Why not put on a fucking like a pirate's outfit?

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       Like why not? Have you ever seen those pirate themed bars where they all have to dress up as pirates? Right. and, and when they get off work, they still think they're pirates. Like there's a whole show about africa, what the show is called. So like they get locked into that. Yeah, they get, they stay, they stay in character. oh jesus christ. Like what about when they go home, they're watching tv, they're pirates sitting home watching frasier. So like when they talked to their google home thing and they're like, hey, google add, let me know where the ale is cold and the women are hot. Do You have a lot of home like siri and alexa was at your house? I don't trust those. That asshole thing or is that asshole that you can make a series say uh oh motherfucker. Motherfucker.

Speaker 2:          01:42:08       Oh, I'm sorry about that. what's the definition of mother

Speaker 11:         01:42:15       as a noun? it means a woman in relation to the child or children to them. She has given birth. Do you want to hear the next one?

Speaker 3:          01:42:22       Yes.

Speaker 11:         01:42:23       As a verb. It means bringing up a child with care. And affection. Do you want to hear the last one?

Speaker 3:          01:42:29       yes.

Speaker 11:         01:42:31       As a verb. It means give birth to.

Speaker 2:          01:42:34       Oh my god. Siri bitch. Chicken from. Yeah, they, they, they, they removed it. But you know what? come on. It was funny. How did they leave it in there and then take it out? Do they take out the dead body one that remember the first one? That's a crazy one. Short for motherfucker. Yeah, it would say as a, you know? Yeah, I bet. Just the still has it.

Speaker 3:          01:42:58       I think I tweeted what it said. What exactly it said.

Speaker 2:          01:43:04       Yeah, I, I did it. I did it the day you did it and it took me a couple tries because I didn't say it right. But it ended up doing. It did it says as a noun. Short form motherfucker. But it could be a verb as well,

Speaker 3:          01:43:18       right? yeah. If you're actually a motherfucker

Speaker 2:          01:43:22       sierra with mother means and it gives you the correct definition, then it asks you. Do you want to hear the next one? If you said yes, it says as a noun, it means short from motherfucker. Yeah, I got it right. But it was weird to hear like I heard it and I was like, what? That's real. Like imagine if that's like your mom and she's teaching a little kid how to use siri. Like, mommy, how do I know what mommy is? Well, we can ask siri, sweetie. We can ask siri what mother means. A let's do it.

Speaker 1:          01:43:53       Do you want to hear the next one? Okay. As a noun. short for motherfucker. the little kids. Like what would that mean? What did they say?

Speaker 5:          01:44:04       What does serious say? If you ask santa is real or some shit like that.

Speaker 1:          01:44:08       Oh, is santa real? I'm going to pretend you didn't ask that. I don't want you to get a lump of coal this year.

Speaker 5:          01:44:19       Alexa tells you and uses the shares a needle.

Speaker 1:          01:44:25       Siri, are you allowed to swear? I don't have the answer to that. Is there something else I can help you with? I just want to know if you stopped using curse words recently. I'm not sure I understand. Well, earlier in this week I had asked you what mother means and you gave me one definition then you had. You said, do you want to hear the next one and you said as a noun it means short for motherfucker. I just thought that was weird. Not nice. Siri, you sound like a crazy person. I'm trying to talk to you about this issue that you and I are having about communication and what do you say to me? You say that's not nice. What's not nice for you to say, motherfucker in front of that little three year old just learning how to talk. Wow, this is the future. Here's some of the stuff I was telling you about. This is the future we're going to be having arguments with our digital devices like that. Like that's a crude like helper. I get super crude helper, right? Like what siri could do and not do. It's very crude, but this is just like the iphone one, right? Maybe they're going to have them. They're absolutely going to have some sort of ai that can keep up with the conversation for sure. That's going to happen.

Speaker 5:          01:45:54       It's. It's pretty crazy how much ahead. I think google and alexa are ahead of siri, like there's terrible. Yeah. I mean, having both of the home pod on the siri and alexa echo or whatever. It's night and day difference.

Speaker 1:          01:46:07       What's better? Siri or bixby? Bixby is a samsung one.

Speaker 5:          01:46:10       Uh, I think uh, well big speeds, very new. I think series better than that. But like alexa, they've, they've even improved alexis so much. Were you seeing like, hey alexa, sing me a love song and there's a whole song that alexa sings deal and there's like 10 of these songs.

Speaker 1:          01:46:26       Well, I think that google has it down the best with the google pixel two phone. When you squeeze the sides and the google assistant comes on and when the google assistant comes on and you just ask it anything and google assistant is just better. Google is good. It just, it just works better. It just, it's better if it finds your results better. It As clunky. It doesn't seem as weird, you know, I think we're in this weird right now with phones, you know, it's like we're expecting things of phones thAt we don't even want or need and they've never asked for before. What we're looking for, augmented reality phoneS, a double is projectors to project a fucking movie on a wall. I've seen those. They have phones.

Speaker 2:          01:47:04       Do not know. It's. It's very interesting. I love paying with my phone. That's my knuth who said great love apple. Pay your face. Use your face. Should he pay for shit or apple watch. You don't have to do shit. What did you think? I didn't talk to you about this. What did you think about the us government telling us not to use walway phones. A huawei phones are made by the chinese and they're like, don't trust the way phones. Yeah. Well, I mean there might be something to it. Like if it's a something that say, you know, like an iphone, it sends messages to apple all the time. I've location and, and all that crap like that. So that's like a foreign country that has the ability to track it's people, you know, it's, it's a little weird. I, I see why they did it, but it's a shape found anyway. Who cares? Well

Speaker 1:          01:47:58       apparently they're in some sort of a dispute with huawei about Iran. See if we can find that like something way to be punished. Something I ran something about servers that they sold to Iran. They're not supposed to sell. I don't know, jamie will find the article, but then they were saying we recommend you not using that. Consumers not use their phones. And a bunch of tech guys that I was reading, I was reading a bunch of articles and the tech guys were super skeptical because one of the things they were saying, it's like with anything is in there, we'll find it like you, you can't just say like, they might be using these things as spy devices without any, without any evidence. It says while ways under us criminal investigation for illegal Iran sales heels. Here's what's next. So the other, the other, um, theory by the super conspiracy theorists is that they're trying to keep out the number three, um, cell phone maker in the world from establishing a foothold in the us mArket and economically strengthening the communist government over there or pseudo communist government. what are they? Now? They're communists, but they, you can make money.

Speaker 2:          01:49:10       When I, I literally saw sometimes stumbled across something. I think on instagram yesterday, there's just a post about walway and them being linked to the ccp, which is the communist party in China. People are like, don't do it. It's too bad dude, because they got this fucking phone. Electro megapixels on the camera. Right? That's what you didn't bitch. Don't shoot down my dreams. I don't piss on your yeezys need to check him on these. Huawei is, took a day off of the easiest. Weiwei has as

Speaker 1:          01:49:44       this um, um, something mate pro porsche design rs, something rs. It's a crazy phone. It's got 500 gigabytes of storage. Five hundred, 500 gigabytes of storage. It's crazy. I think maybe even more than 500. It's got a 40 megapixel camera. It turns, literally turns night into day. When you take photos, like when they have a list, like a four second aperture will stay open and you see the pictures and you're like, holy shit. You see regular camera photos. And then they see the photos with his camera. They're like, hands down. This is the best camera in cell phones today. Do you know how hard it would be to take that picture though? Oh yeah. Super hard. Deadly for four seconds or the. It'd be all blurry and fucked up. Um, I don't know how that works. You do more than I do. You would have to really hold it steady.

Speaker 1:          01:50:35       Right? Like, like sit it on something ready. Couldn't even track my button. You'd have to have a remote trigger. You'd fuck it up by even maybe touching it and then it'll give you a slight pause and then they'll start. They don't probably. They might do that now actually, but they don't typically do that. See if you can go to that. It's camera. Go to the walway. What is the. I think it's like the mate 10 art. Is that it? Yeah. Do this phone as this shit. I'm disgusted that it's a spy device because I want one so bad. So I think. Isn't that good? I mean, have you looked at the reviews? Are we terrible? Their reviews? Probably like, yeah, it's not as good as an iphone if I want it to be honest with you. I liked the fact that there's competition. It makes me excited.

Speaker 1:          01:51:17       You just like the porsche wall felt like that too. Sure. Obviously. I like those cars. I liked their engineering. They, they, they're german wizards. They know how to design shit and a really spectacular way. They make cool stuff. They make cool watches and shit, but I think what's really. Well, there's a bunch of things interesting to me about it, but what's interesting to me is when these cameras and these phones from these android manufacturers are so good, it forces apple to come with some next level shit too. Like this is a technology race, unlike any other race, like computers have even stalled out. Right? Like you get a new mac book. Do you even pay attention to what the fucking gigabytes are now? Now you know, you remember the gigahertz were like the thing like you want to log a two point seven. Should I pay more for the three point two? Remember that? Yeah. $300. $500 more for one point. Yeah. Remember they take those celeron and overclocking. You know, people will do anything to get to one, you know, one, 100 megahertz or what? What's, what's like three gigahertz is like a good laptop, right? It's all about quad core processors now. Right now it's course. But in the old days like you'd get like a celeron 400 right multithreading thread. Like when they hit one gigahertz, people were shitting their pants. Like I can't believe we got a one

Speaker 5:          01:52:46       gigahertz computer. This is madness. Overclocking still, I don't think it pushes above five, maybe

Speaker 1:          01:52:52       number overclocking due to go into the little spacers were those things called again, jumpers, the jumpers and move them around and change things in the bios. Your fuckIng computer be catching on fire and be running so hot.

Speaker 5:          01:53:04       Yeah, that shit's real. I used to work at gateway. That was always so fun because we always had the brand new computers. Like tHe day it came out like, oh, we had the new pentium two, you know, and it was fun playing with computers that fast. Yeah man. Cella ron's. So I just got from my twitch channel selling computer. No. Oh, bad ass over clock to sli video cards and the shit called m dot two storage, which is super fast and it's crazy. Well now what is this? What company is this from? Uh, the company that made it is a origin pc. They put together the parts that gave me a pretty cool glass with my logo on it and all that kinda shit. There's led lights in it. Someone was looking at waste some time. I got a razor laptop.

Speaker 1:          01:53:49       Yeah, that razor, her laptop is like one of the closest things. So like, like build quality, the way a mac book fields with the metal frame and still tight tolerances and it could keyboard and shit.

Speaker 5:          01:54:02       Yeah, it's a great computer. It's powerful. I mean I use it for virtual reality and it's scott, one of the best graphics cards you can buy and it's, it's pretty sweet. I used to

Speaker 1:          01:54:10       by everything apple. I used to just buy apple laptops, apple phones. But I like it that it's a question now, you know, like I told you that I started using that thinkpad. I liked the thing way better than a mac book. The keyboard is way more responsive. There's. There's travel to the keys, like it's easier to type like there's something about those little clickety click keys that the new mac books have. Were you the you make more mistakes? They don't. They don't. You don't have a feel to them because you're not, you know, like, oh yeah, that clicked. Oh yeah. That clicked through a clumsy type or like me, I type way better on a keyboard that has some travel to it. Like you get some feel, you get a feel of what you're doing and where the letters are.

Speaker 5:          01:54:53       The new macbook pro is probably one of the worst versions of any mac book pro since they started making it. I hate the new mac book pro with a passion in that. The the dongle shit needs to stop. Like the other day I needed a usb port. I didn't. Hey, I forgot my dongle. There was no way for me to do it. Anything that I needed to do. It's the worst. It's the worst us hudson's just not

Speaker 1:          01:55:18       where yet. You know wHat I mean? It's a lot of things you could charge your phone with usbc with. There's some things that you have their old usb and if you have to be like, oh

Speaker 5:          01:55:26       well this is useless. I wish apple would have a exchange program where you could go in and they'll take out your touch bar and that keyboard and just put in like any keyboard you want. Like I just want to regular mac book, pro keyboard on my laptop

Speaker 1:          01:55:39       in the mac book, but the thing about this thinkpad jammy, the way the keys work, like when you're typing on it, there's all this travel. THey feel good. Like I can, like I put my finger onj and f and when I'm typing I can. They feel like they're pressing the press, press, press, press, press. It's not like a, like no. Travel doesn't give you the same amount of feedback any guy ports, but feel a lightness.

Speaker 5:          01:56:07       That's the crazy thing. That's nice. Yeah. I like that little light. Sexy, really sexy, great battery life too. What do you know what this processor is? Do you know what a.

Speaker 1:          01:56:20       It's a seller on 400. Dude, don't don't quick on this bro. So we're going to set up a land party here where we're trying to figure out the right way to do it, but we're going to set up a land party here.

Speaker 5:          01:56:32       GAme now a fortnight. Is that. Oh, you guys are doing. I think he will be addicted to fortnight in underground more than anyone. You know, if you have a limited amount of time, we go right back to quake. What happens? Yeah, but it's like the. If you like quake, you'll love this. Champions game was this quick online game.

Speaker 1:          01:56:54       Looks so crazy good. And the fact that it's all web based now. Come on son. It's. Yeah, went away some time. Come on over man. Folks and people up. Bring some people into a room.

Speaker 5:          01:57:07       You would be a championship gamer, wouldn't if you. If you got into it and if you got into it, you would be like one of the top gamer. You'd be the ninja.

Speaker 1:          01:57:16       No, no. I'm a not quite artistic enough

Speaker 5:          01:57:19       to get the top of the food chain. Fat ass. I don't know who he is. You see the top guy when you say is the top guy, he's one of my favorItes to watch. He got drake on.

Speaker 1:          01:57:29       I think honestly that video games are pro at high level, especially quake. It's deceptively intellectually challenging. Like when they have these, um, they would do a lot of these, one on one death matches and they would be in a room and they would both spawn at the same time. Then you have to run, you have to have knowledge of the map and you also have to have knowledge of when certain items are going to respond. Like if you steal the rocket launcher, the, another rocket launcher will respond and like I forget how many seconds, like 30 seconds. So they would run the map, shoot the guy, collect the extra rocket launch before he can to keep him unarmed and keep killing them over and over again. And after you kill them a certain amount of time, the game is over. And tHe guys who are really good at that, we're just, they're just really smart. They're really smart, really fast. Twitch, super tuned into the game, just like locked in. And then they studied those maps and then they also study like movement. They could do crazy shit like rocket jump onto people and do things like that, like get to areas of the map just because they understood how to hop. They could do it in a way that other people don't know how to do that. The guy ninja he's talking about is what you're describing. So then again, fortnight you have to build these crazy. Is this fortnight?

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       Yeah, you have to be, you find mats which are materials and you billed for it. So it becomes, these are one on one matches. If you're playing solo where you have to like literally build advantage. You have to gain advantage. Why is that? Why other bricks flying in the air? He's gaining the materials. So you're mining. Oh. And then that becomes what you're talking about. You have to like either you have only a couple guns you can choose from. So how did this build this bridge here? So he's doing it that fast and he's. He knows there's a guy over there and he's going to attack right now. Oh wow. And it's his decision on how he does it though and the map never changes really. They just sort of changed through the building to get in there. You can build it back up. I got a problem with this game because to addictive, addictive, just watching the addictions, the colors to this game has gotten some crazy colors which is like crack for your brain. This is amazing. And it's weird because grown adults just Fallen in love with this overnight. Well that's what I'm saying. Like I was joking around about video games

Speaker 1:          01:59:40       that I'm not artistic enough. I think the best guYs are going to be considered like chess players. I think it's like kind of the same thing. It's just chest is traditionally worshiped as this intellectual game. Right. But I think that a lot of video games like starcraft for sure is like this really high level strategy game. Like you're doing things and you're thinking on multiple levels about different parts of the board and different things that you're moving around. It seems to me to be like physically dynamic too because things are moving quick like you, you're not, you're not in control of what your opponent is doing while he's doing it. It's all happening in one time. You try to think your way through things and put stuff here and move stuff there too. This were, we under appreciate them because when they first started out they were frivolous like pong and stuff like that to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to uh, to it. So we think of them as being dumb, but they're so sophisticated now and kids were making fucking shitloads of money to who was, who was saying that

Speaker 2:          02:00:40       he was saying that your kid, like you should parents should probably encourage their kids to play games because there's fucking money in it. Now. You know, johnny caRson's old studio, you've been there probably a million times. Jay leno studio, it's now a blizzard arena right down the street from me. He's like, there's everyday they had to go there. If you want to go check it out, I would love to go to right down the street from me. That's crazy. But it's a every time I drive by, it's just crowds of people like a sports game. Okay. Now I want you to put on quake champions. Goodness gracious. What do you mean? Goodness gracious. So what is this? The game is called overwatch. I'm trying to find that an arena. Uh, things too. You can see what it looks like. Just put it on quick. I don't want to see any more of this shit. Fucks. Good. Quick arena quake championships, whatever they call it. Even on the, on the side it says something about quake and joe rogan. Work it out on quick. Watch this.

Speaker 3:          02:01:41       Here we go, son. What does this. Is that an ad first? Whoa gameplay. Dude. Come on. See, this is way better. Look at this. This is old school. This room. I want to play it because it reminds me of the old. I mean, look at the graphics in this fucking thing. God damn graphics are good now. I mean it's just. I wonder if tHat's bad for your eyes or good for your eyes. imagine if they found out that video games actually improve eyesight.

Speaker 5:          02:02:12       Remember when we grew up, they were told us not to sit next close to the tv, but now we are sold vr units where we're the closest to a tv possibly made. What happened to that? Look at this motherfucker.

Speaker 3:          02:02:27       Dude. This game looks perfect. This unreal. This is still quake britain endless. Dun dun dun. She that rocket jump. Yep. Come on son.

Speaker 5:          02:02:37       what was the one? Was a quake the one that they had the space one where you just like trampoline to over? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. I think that was quick.

Speaker 3:          02:02:44       Two, it had that they did that. They had bouncy little things everywhere. I came along at quick to um, I didn't play a whole lot of quake one, but quake one was really fun. I played a little bit of it. It was really fun. Quake one was um, these like kind of blocky looking dudes with helmets on. They run around shooting each other, but it was like real fast paced, like unrealistically fast paced. Like it wasn't like this. One of the things that some people like about, uh, what was that half life game that people would play was based off a half life and it was like an army game. Like counterstrike. Yeah. Most popular game probably still right now. Yeah. People love that. Love that game. One of the things they loved about it was that it had more realistic

Speaker 5:          02:03:31       physics ticket. How many times did your phone rings? You take a picture of the screen. How many times, if you, how many of your photos or screenshots? Unnecessary screenshots over a mountain?

Speaker 3:          02:03:43       Yeah. Um, what wIll we, what was I just saying? Oh, halflife turned into army. Yeah. So if you go to quake one, what is this game you counterstrike? Oh, this is the graphics. It's honestly, I'm pretty sure it's still the same levels as back in whatever night. They just have one item hd, which is better. This looks incredibly. This looks good. We gotta get you guys' computers. Got headshot it dead. Wake up with a knife. Trying to find a gun. Here we go. Okay. Go to quake one. What's that? I'm just on twitter.

Speaker 5:          02:04:23       Oh, this is a guy playing on twitch. Oh wow. Summit playing live. They have a quake one game live now. Oh yeah, yeah. Oh, that's crazy. To see anything. If you're curious about a new game, you just go to twitch and watch someone playing. It's like

Speaker 2:          02:04:37       a dude waiting for someone to play him. I like to go to sleep watching a girl play some boring ass game. Like there's people out there. They're still into this. This is how crazy quake one was. The graphics didn't even matter because the game, it was all dark and moody and the gameplay was so fun that a lot of people even stayed with it after quake two and then quake three became like sort of fast paced like that. See if you can find a video of people playing it. here's a comparison of the old one versus the other. Updated graphics. This. Yeah, it was super blocky. What was the game that. There was a mod. it was a mild, but you're in the bathroom, like in here hiding and toilets and on toilet paper rolls. I feel like I've already asked this, but yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:05:23       I know talking about those, I think those rocket arena, there was like a rocket to read a map where you could play quake and the bathroom was my favorite. I've spent days on that. Well, there was a bunch of maps that people would create, you know, and there was even map making software and you could, you could make a bap and guys were always doing it. It was, it was a really common thing. There was a joe rogan level. Remember somebody made that. Oh, with the jre? Yeah. Look a little logo. I think so. I think someone did do something like that. I remember that, but it's a. I remember they would do all these new maps would come out and we would play matches on these new maps. You'd kick my ass till five in the morning, dude. you're like, no, don't get off yet.

Speaker 2:          02:06:03       I had a real problem. The real problem with games, you know, doing my best, doing my best to avoid them, but we're going to indulge a little bit here. Virtual reality, man, that's my. That's my favorite man. I can't get an I love it. And now you could play like, was it doom or first person shooter? I forget which one it assumes on there and follow up for us on that. Yeah. You play doom. Doom in vr. Can you show me that? Show me doom in vr. Which doom is it? Is it the more recent tickets? The original. The original design? It probably. I think so, but it's probably like the cpu power probably isn't able to keep up. I want to upgrade my age. This is not the original one. It's an upgraded version of it. Oh, is it? Oh, just upgraded graphics of this.

Speaker 2:          02:06:46       Um, this does not look like this. Looks like the newer ones took the original doom and remade it remastered if you will, is what it's called. That's crazy. I actually bought this. So this is doom vfr, which is a special vr version and I think they might've have some levels. I don't know if it's the actual full game from start to finish. oh my god dude. But when you said it's the original game, I thought you meant like with the original graphics, these graphics are really good. This is, this will fuck your life up. I said I could've brought it. We should do this, this right here to fuck your life up. This looks way too fun. You don't have virtual reality. You have virtual reality at your house. No. Oh, you got to get her to go running. I work out. Do things. Oh, we don't want them to do that anymore, man.

Speaker 2:          02:07:30       That scared the shit out of me. That legitimately scared the shit out of me that watching that video, the doom because was like, that could ruin my life. Did the features liposuction as kanye man, liposuction opioids and playing virtual reality to them until it shrivel up. I'm trying to make 1:30. That's how you do it. Just just play video games all day. You never eat. Stay quito. What games do you play in a. I just got a god of war. The new god of war, which that looks. You want to see graphics. That's amazing graphics. So to me, I saw one in the commercial, but it looks incredible. Yeah, it's that and that's a real fun game. I tried to get into far cry five, but I like the color aspect. Like at first I, I, I told duncan trussell you have to buy this immediately because there was, is this is a real walk through gameplay. Gameplay. Gameplay. Yeah. Loading screen. There's no game to look at them. The steam coming out of his mouth. This is incredible. Yeah, and no, like you said, no loads screens. It goes in like, that's just the game dude. This is nuts. Yeah. That's the third person. Or do you do it? First person. Keep this going, jamie, to show you some cool shit on it. Jamie's real cliquey today. Notice quickly is that adderall is going crazy. Going crazy. Oh yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:08:54       Oh my god. This is nuts. Yeah. Do that again. Well, not all the way. All the way to the beginning. I want to see like how they set it up

Speaker 3:          02:09:07       to help him out. I'm actually shooting it. Are good. Do playing this shooting in the head. He's trying to. Why would you do that? Because you know. Go. There you go. Good, good. Thanks. Tait fletcher.

Speaker 2:          02:09:24       This is real. This is real clunky. Looking like it doesn't look real, but it looks way realer than anything I've ever seen before. So this is check this out. This is actually like, this is. You're battling some of you guys trying to kill you with that big rock. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:09:42       it's a. Games are amazing now. shadows and everything. It's incredible. Yeah. Well what I'm saying is that like, I mean this obviously looks amazing, but in how many years do you think it will be indistinguishable from real life? 10, 20, 20 for short, right? In 20 years you don't think so. Sort of skeptical on this a little bit because I feel like the bar keeps getting moved at five years, 10 years. Every couple of years. We get, we get close skeptic over here. We get close but it's still like the window, the window. You get your first five. It was, it's been four or five years I've had or the oculus rift since beta testing, so I've had always had it and I just had a big vr la thing this weekend and I didn't hear anyone sharing anything that was like mind blowing experiences that are making everyone go out and spend $2,000 on a vr rig. Well, I Think right now what's happening is the infancy of vr in a commercial level.

Speaker 1:          02:10:34       That's what we're seeing. I mean, it's like if you go back to the early day at targhee boxes and then compare them to a new xbox. I mean, I think that's where we're looking at. You're just saying that it's not happening quick. Those definitely happens. Those are gigantic gaps, but you can look at it from a different perspective and be like, it's still just playing with the remote control on a tv with some computer power behind it. And even those virtual stuff is also sometimes connected to those three dimensional. Um, uh, one of those things that, how do they call them? They don't call the treadmill, what do they call them? new track omnisphere. Yeah. That thing, have you seen that thing? Yeah, you're strapped into the center of this thing and it moves. The rest of you could walk through these three d environments, but you know if you.

Speaker 1:          02:11:16       But if I was gonna save just 20 years ago, what kind of bullshit ass graphics were we looking at and now look at what we're looking at now. They just 20 years from now they'll probably have it like at the very least it'd be like watching marijuana or something. That's what I just still feel like it was still feel super fake, will still know that this is still a big world and it's not going to ever get lost in it pretty. I think it's easy to get lost in it nowadays. They have big rooms almost like size of chuck cheese where you renting out in so you don't need a treadmill because you're actually going through obstacles that are feel real. Like they would if they did it in a way where it's like it's, it's, it's not realistic, but it's really good. Like, like what if they did despicable me?

Speaker 1:          02:11:59       Like you were in despicable me. You know the animated movie with the. What's the dude's name, the fucking bad guy. I know you're damaged. Yes. I forget. Is the bad guy in the character's name? That was a group except like that. Is that his name? Honestly, I don't have any candy. I have kids, but the graphics are incredible. It's beautiful. I mean it's stunning to look at it like, wow, they did an amazing job with this, but it's obviously not real. You know what I'm saying? You wanted to be like, like that or like extra, not just a simulation of your life. You'd want to be able to fly early, you know, jump over fucking buildings. You've gone. You've done the simpsons game right in universal fucking incredible. Right. So good to ride the ride. Yeah. Well the. Yeah. So again, that ride where it's this huge video screen and your, your car moves up and down and they're just taking you through this crazy thing that you're seeing in front of you and it's probably as thrilling as any actual ride where you're really moving. Right. Is the back of the future ride though? Before that? I didn't see that one because then 40 yet the 40 theaters out here. no, that's what you try, Man. That's where you're. The whole thing moves with the movie and there's also smell. There's also missed and potter. Yeah, it's. It looked like ivan pukey kind of. Is it like that? Star wars ride star tours at disneyland. You ever done that? Yeah. It's kind of like that. Yeah, the moves and you could turn off like, I don't want water. I don't want to fart.

Speaker 4:          02:13:33       There will be something like that. I feel like I was trying to look it up right now, but I remember steven spielberg talking about developing a room type theater process process. We're. You're not. Maybe you're not wearing anything, but things are being projected into the room you're in and you're experiencing the movie like that. Like maybe like avatar in the future would be like 25 people jump into the room and it starts playing and you're just experiencing it happen around you versus wearing a headset and watching something happen. I don't think they've developed it yet, but I have seen some beautiful in holograms, man. Some big globe globes is happening in vegas. Right. I think I Just told you about that. Gm is doing something weird.

Speaker 1:          02:14:10       Yeah. I think group things are going to be really interesting in that too. Like everybody experiencing that in a group the same way you experience like a movie in a group, you know, it's entirely possible that they'll develop something like that, right? Where they'll have warehouses where people meet up and everybody goes into these virtual worlds together. Like you go on missions and shit, just wear something that's a, it's tuned in to the wifi signal of the building and you're wearing like a lightweight helmet, like a bicycle helmet with straps on. So it's not substance really cumbersome, but you know, it has enough battery life and enough juice to get you through a one hour game or

Speaker 5:          02:14:51       they have vr experiences where you can go with your whole family and you're all in the game wearing these things and you, uh, you're in the game together. Damn. Yeah. What kind of games of any like virtual reality games, like they have the zombie game. Oh, so you're running from zombies and a warehouse. Yeah. Yeah. I think I hold a link from a good mythical morning. He was talking about how he brought the family and he was getting chased by zombies and I had heard that there were

Speaker 1:          02:15:16       thinking about doing something like that. Now that you think of it, but I didn't know there was an actually a place now. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:15:21       And roller coaster before I feel like we talked about in Utah. Right, right. Remember looking it up right now.

Speaker 1:          02:15:28       Yeah. Like, but I think that's the future. I think the future, this is like you go to a football field and it's like a virtual game is being played, you know, but then you've got to stop people from like physically assaulting each other in the virtual world.

Speaker 4:          02:15:43       Yeah. You have to have a babysitter it anyway. Right.

Speaker 1:          02:15:45       Now remember this, he'd get off an elevator. The future of virtual reality time magazines

Speaker 4:          02:15:51       avoid, let's say if a ghostbusters experience and ones.

Speaker 5:          02:15:54       Yeah. Look at that. This incredible. And that's cool because you're in there in the game with your friend, like you could see your friends, you're in a room with them essentially. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:16:03       So now you're wandering around and see what they're seeing. We get to see what they're saying. This is going to blow their minds. Says the verge. Wow. Fuck yeah, it's already here then. So this is one place that has this?

Speaker 4:          02:16:18       I believe so, yeah. I don't know. There's a place here right across the street from the grove that's like the imax vr thing, but I don't think it's, it's definitely not this. But they might have some similar.

Speaker 1:          02:16:26       I definitely have way too many of these stories. My head,

Speaker 5:          02:16:30       I don't know how many of them are real. How many of them did I make that up? Well, when I went to the, did the house of comedy in the mall of America across from it. It's great, great, huge. But they have like their, like, uh, across from it they have a virtual reality arcade where it's a one is skydiving where you're hanging. Well it, you know. And that was the whole thing, like you could tell that's going to become more popular, kind of like a, a whatever. Those arcades are everywhere in anaheim. Yeah, they do. So it says downtown disney star wars. Oh, is that a new? Yeah. Oh wow. I did

Speaker 1:          02:17:08       soaring over the world. Do you ever do that? That's a disneyland. It's a giant screen. I've only been at disney once and it was bad. You sit down in your chair and you get lifted up and it takes you towards this giant screen. And on this giant screen you, you sore all over these different parts of the world. Oh cool dude. It's fucking crazy. The ride is amazing. You fly over all these different spots and uh, you experienced all this like is if you're soaring and you feel like a light breeze and there's different smells that they send your way, like the older one was soaring over California. You would look at this as bears like, what are you doing, bitch

Speaker 5:          02:17:47       john, you would soar over these orange trees. That bear looks so fake by the way, right? Oh yeah. Are they cooking? Bear

Speaker 1:          02:17:55       get out of here, bitch, um, but the other one was soaring over California, which was pretty amazing too. And you soar with the oranges. You'd smell him. He'd smell the water from the beach and you, uh, things like that will happen. Like the water will splash in front of your face. Then all of a sudden you're being in paris or you'll be somewhere else. It's fucking awesome.

Speaker 5:          02:18:14       Yeah. I have that ethic. Dairy talked about this on here. I walk the plank. I can't remember, I said it on an chair wrote on your podcast or a, it's a real piece of wood and I have like it unbalanced would wear something underneath it. So it kind of rocks if you're standing on it. Uh, so you go up in this elevator in virtual reality road and I have a fan that I turn on right when the elevator door opens and you feel like you're walking on the side of the building, like on this plank. And it, I have my, I have my board kind of rocky, so yeah, I just want us to, uh, uh, and I can't do it. I get halfway through it. I, I shit myself and andy was funny and uh, I pushed my girlfriend off the board. She was like freaking out and I just gave her a little nudge and she goes, oh, and in the game if you fall off, you fall down. Oh my god. Is that my girlfriend now? This is crazy. Is this a new thing? Uh, yeah. I think it's for the vive. Vive. Yeah. And they have a new vibe out. I need to get a better resolution and stuff. And supposedly they have a wireless adapters. You don't have all the cables anymore. A

Speaker 2:          02:19:28       coming soon. I think the world is the most addictive archery game ever have. Those little monsters are trying to attack the castle. Have you played arrows at them? Vertical virtual pool is cool to use it. Yeah, because you have like, you know, you have controllers and you can, like, it's, it's pretty realistic for. You could play pool. Yeah. But if you could only play virtual pool, regular pool, be so fucking amazing. If you don't to. Oh my god, it's a real table. Look at the cloth. I can feel it. Look, I can watch the balls click together. The real, the real in front of me like, well, I'd rather have a control where they're pretends with my finger. I'm going to control what they're pretended to stick. Yeah, but you could also be playing it on moon, on the moon. Can't be playing on the men in your tiny little apartment where you don't have space for a table. That's true too. Yeah. There's video games. You can play a two on your phone, but I've never even thought about it critically. Kate quigley's and she's in a virtual reality porn. Oh boy. She's not naked and she's sitting there, but she's getting molested by a naked girl and it's weird because when you're in the virtual rail road, your kate quigley. Whoa. You are her. Jesus. It's so weird because I had a side gig.

Speaker 2:          02:20:49       Oh good. For her, that's a virtual. Porn has got to be a big market. Yeah. It's not as good as I was hoping for. No. Yeah, that was weird about it. I just like in your head, you think it's going to be like, oh, this is realistic. I was going to make masturbating way mit better, but it's still clunky because all the companies that make virtual reality porn, they're not making like perfect masterpiece is they're still filming it. Sloppy and edited. Sloppy damage for the most part. I mean, unless I haven't seen all of it, but this is just a setup for brian's new career as a porn director of virtual reality. These people don't know what the fuck they're doing. Let me show you how it's done. Did you do the avatar? One, two? No, I did not. Is that a recent one? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:21:34       Disney world avatar. Just open every time. Yeah, that must be amazing. It's the real disney for. They're going to do a, um, some crazy giant star wars thing out here. Right. That's going to be awesome. Yeah, man, it's just weird. It's just a matter of time till there's going to be something like that at a consumer level. Like, like the avatar game. That seems like pretty doable. Maybe. Maybe I just got a little cynical view on it, just like maybe, maybe not super cynical, jamie. I like vr chat. That's my favorite thing in the whole entire world right now. Talking to people in vr. Yeah, it's. It reminds me of the old days of the internet, like when. I don't know what would it be messaged? Sports first came out or something. It's just like, oh, why like the wild wild west right now. Whoa, this crazy. And you could be

Speaker 5:          02:22:26       anyone like I'm windy and you can go to a wendy's in there in all the windies characters together a look. There's semen pekichu, so people just get together in these rooms to hang out together. Talk to the musicians that are just sit there and play songs for you, but as dressed up as a. Are you talking in your voice? Yeah, it's here, but some people use voice changers and stuff like that. Some people just.

Speaker 3:          02:22:52       Hello, my name is missy. A lot of racist people on there. If you leave people alone, they just become racist. You give them notes, those schooling, do you know the way and put them inside of a video game with no repercussions for their actions. That's the internet. Especially if you could be like a little girl, I'd say terrible and words. You know, a little. A blonde girl on the screen for me while you're a 40 year old man from the bronx. Probably didn't check it, but the instagram update yesterday said something about they're blocking words. Bullies like that as well. I wonder what other people are fucking assholes with that man. Again, assholes with the being mean to people online. It's a new toy. We don't to do it yet. It's also revealing a lot of people that you didn't know, like a lot of people that you never got in contact with. Just really shitty people mean. I'm only mean to companies like I. I've switched to my online bullying to only talking about bad services service at restaurants or delivery service. That's well if it's warranted.

Speaker 5:          02:24:04       Yeah, that's what I say, but people get mad at me for like when I posted those things. I can put some of the other day at this chicken place. They burned everything. They sent me like everything. Like the corn on the cob was black. That chicken was black. I had to throw it away and I was late too.

Speaker 3:          02:24:19       Be the chef and the lady working of the counter and they weren't paying attention. Eat chicken. It's probably some 14 year old kid. Frequent problem. You know what I mean? Yeah. Probably some kid who wasn't paying attention. I just had a good fantasy of what was really happening. It was fun. I fucked in a frigerator of restaurant. Hey houlihan's easy fella. Uh, uh, dated a girl. Worked at uh, newport creamery with me. What's that like? A, like a cold stone ice cream place that served hamburgers. Who's that? You remember me. It's me. This fucking phone. I've got a phone that for whatever reason, turns itself on to ring all the time. Yeah. Like even when I don't, it turns the cell phone to ring. It's done it like twice.

Speaker 5:          02:25:10       You know what? I think it's this case, this leather apple case. I think it's a piece of shit. Like look at your volume buttons, look at mine. They're sunk in the middle. Like this suddenly had this like a for a week and it's already falling apart. None not

Speaker 1:          02:25:24       join it. Overheats your phone. I think because of the leather, there's no way for the air to get out. So my shit's running slower than it should. You don't have to do the other day. I put a battery pack on this. Like a madman. A? Yeah. Yeah, put one of them thick ass battery packs on it felt like a superhero. I could just go all day. Why don't you have it on now? Because I took it off because I feel like it was relying on it too much. I should just charge it at night. I'm using my phone less and less after my trip to Hawaii because my phone broke a dropped it the first day there and I had to order a new one.

Speaker 1:          02:25:58       I mean mine to stop working. The whole thing? Yeah. Duty would just randomly call people. I would hold up, I would hold up my contacts and it would just start calling people and then I would hang up and it would start calling another person. No, hang up. It was dark and I was showing people. It's like my friend John Dudley. I was like, watch this watch was doing and then I'd hang up and we'll do that again. I was like, what the fuck? I just dropped it and just went haywire. That's crazy. Yeah, I broke it. And so, uh, when I got a new one for three days I wasn't doing anything. So for three days waiting for my phone to come, I didn't use any apps, any, nothing. And I felt better. I felt better. But you're in Hawaii? Yeah. Yeah. Were in van. Nice. But as soon as I got the phone back again, like, hmm, let me check instagram. Anybody put any cool pictures of cars up technology, so frat and like that. Then why are we still so scared of like ai? If we could just fucking smack it and the breads a silly way to look at nuclear bombs. Jamie, that's technology to remember that said it was silly. I started off by saying smoke too much weed, dude. A dude, uh, or not enough.

Speaker 4:          02:27:06       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          02:27:08       Huh? We should be worried. Don't you think if elon musk thinks we should be worried.

Speaker 4:          02:27:13       He's like in the business of that though of worrying people. No, no, no, but I mean of technology. It's key. Yeah. Well also, yeah. Yeah. That's not the business 100 percent. One hundred percent. But like that's his business. Thirty five percent future of all technology. He's, he's the one figuring out the problems. He was the one here to save us from all of this shit. That's his business that he created. All those tesla's got recalled. I mean, did you saw that? Right? Like $130,000 model ss got recalled because they're steering column was fucked up or something. Is that what happened? I don't know the exact problem, but a lot of them.

Speaker 1:          02:27:45       I remember seeing something. How crazy is it? Ford canceled all their current. Callan loves his. He fucking loves it. Yeah. Ford decided to start making cars except the motherfucking mustang. An suv is I think, well their suv, they're awesome. They make that lincoln town. What is it not? I'm good. Why did they make it? That's lincoln navigator, this new navigator. It's a fucking incredible car. It's incredible. It's like they. They saw all these other cars like that luxury suv family wagon market is a weird market. Like there's range rovers and there's a bunch of mercedes suv and bmw suv, but this is like the first other than the cadillac escalade kinda. But this was like another level, like super high tech family, luxury sled that hauls ass. It's pretty dope dude. I watched some of the videos on it and how they make these things and like all the different features that they have in them. Huge screens now. Everything has giant screens. Like a lot of these cars now, they don't have a dashboard. They just have a screen and you know, you could, you could customize it in different.

Speaker 2:          02:28:51       My mind is a fake screen screen screen. Virtual gauges, right? Yeah. It comes on and says, man, it's crazy. It's weird. It's weird to see. I got a video. We should watch this coming up from the google io thing. It might counter contradict what we were just says. No joke. Google assistant will start making phone calls to. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:29:12       businesses to make appointments on your behalf. It's called google duplex. The api call or even ads? Oms and ems. Oh, jesus.

Speaker 6:          02:29:24       Haircut for a client. I'm looking for something. I mean, it's not a real voice. If you have anything that she would like her to be looking for. Just the woman hair cut for now. We of had a. Okay. What's the first thing that we thought? Okay, perfect. Okay, great. Thanks. Have a great day. Bye.

Speaker 2:          02:30:15       That's awesome. I love that. Totally freaked me out. Yeah. Okay, so now you're back. That's crazy.

Speaker 1:          02:30:25       I think we just learned something. I think we're going to be having conversations with those things. It's going to be like that movie with joaquin. Yeah, that's her. That's her. That is her man. It's just a matter of time. I don't know how much time, but it's definitely 20 years. In 20 years you're going to have people calling you. You're going to have me calling you. I'm going to call you and say some goofy shit. It's not even going to be me. I'm going to call you up and go, dude, what are you doing right now? Come on. Fuck sleep. Let's go do something. Let's get in the car. Let's go drive. Let's just go drive to joshua tree right now and do mushrooms. Fuck it. You don't have any kids. And we'd be like, okay, I'll be by your house in 20 minutes. You'd be out there waiting while I'm home sleeping.

Speaker 2:          02:31:10       Well, it is weird when he talked to like, you know, they can call up apple or something like that and you had the automated assistant and they had the fake typewriter. Sounds like, oh, let me back.

Speaker 12:         02:31:20       It makes me mad. It makes me may still do that. Yeah. Oh yeah. I've heard that. The. Oh my god, that's so crazy. Limit check.

Speaker 3:          02:31:30       Right? Why don't you just take that out and just be fascinating here. So let me hear some of that fake typewriter south.

Speaker 12:         02:31:40       That's hilarious. I forgot they do that. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          02:31:42       apple does that. Oh, it's so clunky to sounds shitty. I just wish apple had more options, you know, like I get that they only one to have one phone and a few different versions of it rather, you know, they have a small one. If the big one, the middle sized one

Speaker 13:         02:32:00       from Canada revenue agency. The reason why the appliances in touch with you by you that back in your text.

Speaker 3:          02:32:12       Yeah. This is a scammer attack scammer, but what brian said was that when you call apple, they would have a fake typewriter sound in the background, but I did get scammed by that text scammer. I think he just got scammed by. That guy was the one I was talking about earlier. That's a lyric, but they didn't really yet. Yeah, no, I knew right away you got knocked off. I did tell my accountant. He goes, yeah, they don't do that. That's what I thought. You need to contact me with your worried about right now. Like who's who's hearing that going? Look, I got a contact. You hold on. I'm in walmart right now. Let me get to my car. Hello? I'm calling you back about the tax thing. Oh, we are so lucky that you have contacted me at this moment for dangers in the air.

I only know about it because young jamie, jamie, and for me that it might've been one of the most epic battles. So funny man. He uh, he owned them so hard to the point where I thought whatever the guy's name is is like, oh, he's making fun of a kid or something like that. Like he calls himself like a younger guy. He calls him an old man. This old man making fun of a young whippersnappers. Young people always like to point that out. That you're older. Yeah, they think it's hilarious because they're so terrified of getting old. Yeah. Like everybody is so like there's this thing or someone will make fun of who you broke. You broke your fucking 36 years old. Like what does it mean? It's almost over bro. Six hundred and 59,000 likes. He said, at least when my career dies, you can film it and put it on youtube meme that suicide for. Why does Logan Paul? He's responding to his. Oh, I'm laughing. Cause now I know why your comedy career took a dive. Oh jesus. He get owned. And so then chris

Speaker 1:          02:34:18       says to him that, yeah, at least with my career dies, you can film it, put it on youtube. That is 658,000 likes more than trump in any, any tweet trump's ever had. And leah, you need to run for president. Uh, it gets a strong that is now strong that, that, that responses, that's like the strongest response I've ever seen because this is logan in response to that say, but knock it a lie. This single tweet is funny. Then your entire netflix special. Thanks. How's it feel to have your name finally attached to something funny?

Speaker 7:          02:34:55       Oh, oh, oh,

Speaker 2:          02:34:59       oh my god. Amazing.

Speaker 1:          02:35:01       God, I don't know what's worse, being the shun vlogger or being the 38 year old comedian arguing with the shunt, vulgar on twitter. Ask your fans to have their moms read this out loud to them. See what they.

Speaker 2:          02:35:19       God, that's good. Oh my god. Oh my god. He's the wrong guy to fuck with he. He'll do this all day old people roasting me. Greatest thing on planet earth.

Speaker 1:          02:35:31       How about this? You're my son. Tag your fucking daddy.

Speaker 7:          02:35:34       I'm fucking dead.

Speaker 2:          02:35:38       Well, what's the thing that he deleted? Oh, that's hilarious. Damn powerful. Kristalina. Fucking love it. Hard in the paint crystal. Funny dude. Man data. His instagram stories or some of my favorites. Anything chris does is pretty fucking funny. So far you've called me daddy and admitted to watching my entire comedy special. Are you trying to burn me or fuck me.

Speaker 2:          02:36:06       Okay. That's all right. I get it. Just delirious. I don't know why you would try to fight a professional comedian on twitter. He's a comedian. A guy like chris who loves that kind of shit. He loves that kind of stuff. Who doesn't? That's. Yeah, he's like an artist, but that kind of stuff like perfectly like not aggressive. You know everything about it. It's like it was very smooth. It was very good. Here. It's like the old days, you know, putting people on the. That was a very good one. You know, people are so weird. They really are.

Speaker 1:          02:36:44       I'm just wondering what's going to be the next thing that people, you know, like instagram seems to be like a that's a, a platform. People like they like pictures and text behind the pictures, but like what is going to be the next thing? Is it going to be some sort of augmented thing, some virtual thing or some goggles thing or it's got to be something that's going to be something in another space other than just your phone. I really think that there's gonna come a time where the same amount of time that people spend on social media, they're going to spend some sort an augmented state, like you'll be able to wear these things for work because they help you pull things up so people just accept. I have to have my goggles. Like everybody wears goggles at a certain point in time because it's just so much cooler. It adjusts for vision, gives you perfect vision.

Speaker 4:          02:37:29       That black mirror episode about the human, the dvr when everyone can record, but yes, that's. I mean so many other black mirror things have sort of been coming true. That seems like the most realistic one that might happen. I think.

Speaker 1:          02:37:41       Recording memories. Yeah, probably someday.

Speaker 4:          02:37:44       I think they're close. I saw an article recently. They're close to being able to either record your dreams and play them back for you or reinterpret them after you're awake, but I think it's record them as you're sleeping and kind of find out what you were. Maybe rewatch it or something. I hope not. What if the shits in high def if like falling

Speaker 1:          02:38:03       buildings in high def demons or barking at you?

Speaker 4:          02:38:10       No, I. I had. Do you ever out of nowhere just have a dream. You're like embarrassed that you even thought that even though you had no control of it.

Speaker 1:          02:38:19       A lot of them theoretically recording dreams is possible. Scientists are trying to cover magazine march. Of course it is. They just got to figure out how to get into the door with eventually if people survive, they're going to have with every generation a greater greater understanding of how to manipulate things around them. It's just what people strive for. Strive for manipulating the environment, manipulating electrical currents, manipulating concrete, moving things around, shaping things that we just keep getting better and better and better at it. Of course, we're going to keep getting better and better at it technologically to can I have some crazy shit, man, and we're going to wonder why we did it. We're going to all be stuck. Some strange, weird matrix like environment we're already are. It seems like it easily could be happening. Not necessarily like right now, but on the way to that, like what's the logical conclusion?

Speaker 1:          02:39:23       I mean is does anybody believe that people at this point are going to back up? That they're going to go, hey, you know what? This technology is just getting too much into our lives. We went to a restaurant last night. Dad was on his phone. This kid's got a 12 inch ipad propped up in front of them. The other kid on the other side of the table has a 12 inch ipad propped up in front of him and they're just watching three different things and no one's talking to each other and they're there at a sushi joint. Wow. And you're like, wow, this is what people do. They get together, they put a show on in front of the kid, hey, go. And they just the entire time, not even like the parents are done, they want to talk and can I use your phone, your head?

Speaker 1:          02:40:04       Go ahead and use my phone and play a game. The kids playing in the game, somebody talking to somebody? No, nobody's talking to anybody. Everybody's looking at it. An electronic device. You go to public place and they sit down and then not interacting with each other. It is super normal, man. If you look around, it's super normal, super normal, weird. We're going to wonder about that in a few years. We're going to wonder like how do they let that in? How do they lead this? Like I was watching these little kids. I was like, okay, I don't want to be a judge parent, but just I'm just looking at it like a human. How much less time are they spending talking to people now, how many less awkward moments at the dinner table we had a workout. Just controlling your temper or controlling your emotions are controlling the way you interact with people or trying to be nicer about some of the ways you say things and learning to get that. The only way people learn about that stuff is at a dinner table, right? Talk to each other. That's part of like how people learn to communicate with each other, sitting down at dinner. Right. All of a sudden everyone's like watching a screen. How much less time are we spending talking like how much shittier are people going to be if they continue doing that at talking to real people and is that an issue?

Speaker 5:          02:41:23       I think it is. I think people don't have as strong as compassion with each other, like as much as much compassion and then mike value human life. That's why there's more school shooters and and you know, the realness of it. It's kind of getting faded, you know, death is way more in your eyes nowadays as a kid than it was when we were young. We were just, you know, you know, playing with frogs and playing cops and robbers. We didn't have internet to see death. We didn't have. Tv wasn't about death at the time. You know, a video. Video games is all death. I mean you have lives in video games when, when was the, you have lives when you're a kid, you know, the cats had that. That's a good point, man.

Speaker 1:          02:42:06       I mean especially how much you could see on the internet, the, the amount of horrible shit that people see on a daily basis on the internet. Like people will tell me, hey, you want to see this video? I'm like, no, I've seen enough. I know what people are capable of. I'm good.

Speaker 5:          02:42:21       Some people not though. Some people all day watching fucked up shit, don't, don't, don't, don't start with cable though. Do you remember how it started with cable and when we were an older. I wasn't old enough but

Speaker 1:          02:42:32       sorta, but it really started with videotape. Okay. Like faces of death and shit like that. You started seeing the face of death. I remember the video a friend of mine sent me was a girl walking towards the train. She's not paying attention and she gets nailed by the train and it's fucking horrific man. She just gets torn apart. You watch and you're like, oh my god. Oh my god. It's hard to watch.

Speaker 5:          02:42:55       I used to always talk about this, but what was, it was definitely faces of death and it was definitely ufc one, two and three, you know, like the early days of ufc seeing mixed matched like people go at it and just the brutal kaos you know, and there was no rules back then. It was just like death. You're.

Speaker 3:          02:43:12       There wasn't very many rules like you couldn't eye gouge where you could punch in the nuts. Right. And you never saw that before it was boxing on tv. It was never like, oh my god, these guys are fighting like dirty, dirty fighting and pulling hair and not punching shit. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's probably true too. I think our appetite for stimulation is increasing. That's what I think for real. I think that's why people like so many thrilling things. I think we're developing a stronger and stronger appetite for stimulation. That's what I think it is, dude. And and I think the internet and you know, just so many different things you could see like how, how was it the weekend like instantaneously pull up video of a volcano eating a car. I mean, what, how many people are supposed to see that? Like, you're not supposed to see that shit all day from all over the world. You're not supposed to see all these different volcano eruptions and different shootings and cars running over people in times square and all that crazy shit. If he lived in Kansas, a lava shouldn't really be. Yeah, it should be on your list of shit. You got a small amount of things to think about in front of you. You could live forever at each direction. Everything's flat. You shouldn't be worried about lava should you wish you should have some fucking lava to mix things up.

Speaker 3:          02:44:30       That's gotta be a weird place to be, man. When you're watching that earth crack open and you realize how thin the crust is between you and the most insane shit ever. Rivers of hot molten rock, right under the surface of the ground. You're walking on like, what? How much is down there? Why did we camp out here? I get paranoid. It's still at earthquakes. I was in the belly room at the comedy store the other day, packed. Right? And if it was just like the big earthquake, then we would all be dead. It was too many people. There would be no escape this one place because you know what I mean? But I got that in my head. I'm like, alright, I gotta get outta here. So terrible thing to think of a building and it starts collapsing or any parking garage, living here in la, we go to this whole parking garages downtown here, like, oh yeah, I'm going to be a sandwich.

Speaker 3:          02:45:18       Something. Yeah man, I, I came to la right after the first earthquake. Uh, first one, obviously the big one, the last big one. Um, and then there was some small ones after that. There was a, I think that one of the biggest ones was san francisco. I think san francisco was during the world series. It was a really big one. Right. How big was that one? I think. Was it going on during a game? Yeah, in the middle of the game world started to end. That'd be cool footage. San francisco gets a lot of them. There was a six point nine is the same as the one on why. Wow. What's the coincidence of that? Huh? Wow. That's some powerful shit. And just the. To me it's a.

Speaker 1:          02:46:10       It's a thing that we all know to be true, but you don't think about it until it happens. We all know that the earth's mantle shifts and moves. We know that, that it happens. We know that earthquakes happen. We know the volcanoes happen, but even so it's still

Speaker 3:          02:46:30       the hesitation allowing jose conseco to score and he goes to get dave parker. So when is the earthquake here? Second phase. So the oakland a's.

Speaker 2:          02:46:48       It's like a scene in a movie.

Speaker 7:          02:46:49       What the fuck? Holy shit. Wow.

Speaker 1:          02:46:58       That's just one of those things. You know,

Speaker 2:          02:47:01       we think of it like, yeah, yeah, the earthquakes are real, but until it actually happens at scary, it was kind of scary. You felt a good one, right? You felt a little bit of a tremor. It seems like it used to be way more when I first moved here. Like I almost feel one like once a month for awhile. I haven't felt one in a long time. It's on tape right here. What is red bands feeling? The earth. Oh yeah. This is when I was. I felt

Speaker 3:          02:47:27       this is probably the biggest one. I remember really. Death squad studio isn't frozen. This happened to me before we to. There it goes. I started thinking about our insurance covers this frozen.

Speaker 2:          02:47:53       Is it youtube is fault on my computer. Oh, is that? Oh, is it the machine? Yeah. Tri caster think. Oh yeah, that, that freaked me out because we had the studio at the ice house and I kept on thinking about the ceiling. Just cave in because that's like an old building. Yeah. And I freaked the fuck out, but that was scary. I think they did something to make it earthquake compliant though. Do you know if I'm. I hope I'm right about this. You're right. Do you know how you walked through the courtyard area? Yeah, yeah. They put all that stuff apparently to reinforce it from earthquakes. Yeah, I mean that the walls or something it might fix but not the ceiling fucking fall right through it links. It's already have that building's phone. Like what? Nineteen 50 something I probably said earlier than that. I mean I think crazy old, right? Like it's. I think it's been an operation as a nightclub since the sixties. I think it started out as an actual ice house, like way earlier than that opened in 1960, 1969. It opened the ice house. What was it before in that building? I'm pretty sure in that building and it wasn't actual ice house, which is why they decided to call it the ice house. You know, sean's doesn't work there. Yeah, I know.

Speaker 5:          02:49:08       It sucks. Twenty years. He's an awesome guy.

Speaker 1:          02:49:11       Place is so sweet. Well, where do you go?

Speaker 5:          02:49:15       Uh, I'm not sure. I haven't talked to him about it on the air. Go tom. You said besides therapist now. Hey, he does it better than anybody at first. Feels weird because you know, the air blows it in there. Oh, I don't think that's, that's not fda approved. Could you imagine if this was, is that a rub maps still a thing when backpage still funny. I know this went backpage, uh, went down a rub. Maps kind of freaked out for like a week and said like, hey, you know, we're not, we're, we're not open right now. Nothing's working. Uh, you won't be charged this month. Uh, and uh, but then like a couple of weeks later that it's back in, it was always working to like, it just had this weird notice before it.

Speaker 1:          02:50:02       Well, I wonder how people feel, you know, that are in that business, those backpage companies and all those, those companies that are, you know, those, those, uh, some that's like the classifieds, right? Right. Like, so they have to pay to be in the classifieds that don't work. So they lose all that business, all of it. It's like a nonverbal business anymore.

Speaker 5:          02:50:23       Well, roadmaps was good because it was like yelp for a massage parlor and and so you if you wanted to go. I use it for the opposite reason. Now we're like, the other day I wanted a real massage and I checked to make sure that that wasn't a rub and tug place. Right. Because they're all rubbing to have places here in los angeles. Like it's hard to find one that's not now and sometimes you just don't want that. You want a real massage. I guess what I said doesn't make sense though because it's illegal activity. So as long as it's illegal activity, of course they have to take it down. No, I don't think. Not really. What do they say? Freedom of speech and shit. Like, like you're allowed to talk about cocaine, you're not going to get your website taken down. And that's crazy. Like

Speaker 1:          02:51:04       not even what I mean. I mean I don't, I don't think that. I feel like if you're a person who is making this decision and like 2018 you saying, you know what, we've got to crack down on prostitution. We got to figure out a way to. We got to figure out a way to put a stop to this. Like, what are you wasting your time doing that for a don't we have other really big issues that we have a hard time finding enough people to tackle.

Speaker 5:          02:51:30       The biggest problem is sex trafficking. That's the real reason. Like there's too much traffic.

Speaker 1:          02:51:35       Yeah, that. That's a big one.

Speaker 10:         02:51:37       I'm just.

Speaker 1:          02:51:41       When everything's unregulated, right? Anything that's unregulated, you're always going to find someone who fills that gap was a criminal. Anything that's illegal that people want, whether it's drugs, anything. It's really hard to tell people what they can and can't do. It's really hard. It doesn't seem to make any sense. You shouldn't be able to. As long as no one's getting hurt, you know? Like what if someone decides, hey man, we at this furry thing

Speaker 2:          02:52:06       and you guys are just too weird. You can't do this anymore. You can't just dress up like mascots and have sex with each other and eat a dog. Food bowls can't do that anymore. That's neat. These people ever. They're having a party as furries. What if someone came, comes along and says, you can't do that anymore. It's too weird. Have reacted fine. I mean, I just think it's weird where people just can decide what other people can and can't do. Especially when it comes to something as ridiculous as sex touching is that thing that makes no sense. Like hand jobs should not be illegal. No. Like you're allowed to touch my arm but you can't touch my dick. It's going to be real weird. When robots are fuckable like really weird when they're really fuckable like they're hot.

Speaker 2:          02:53:00       You know the hot. It feels good. What if someone raped that robot? Is it going to have rights? Jesus christ going to kill you, bro. They don't need to sleep. That chick's gonna wait until your sleep and then she's going to fucking elbow your eye sockets right through. Like I got arrested for like fucking a car recently or something like that. Yeah, I didn't hear about that. I think it's a matter of time before they develop an ai in a physical body that's so closely resembles a human body that you could turn the lights down, light a candle, those new ones, like the hottest girl in the world. You've seen the new ones, right? The new sexual sex robots, the ones I think they're making, they make them in san diego. I think it's the same guy that made the real dog, but that he has that new ai and the new bodies.

Speaker 2:          02:53:42       It's it. You can order it now. I think a preorder it now it's a, they had a video of it and then the ai is pretty legit and it's not bad. Uh, it talks to you. It remembers you. You can pick the face, you can design what you want it to look like. A dude. It's a matter of time. I know as a matter of time, I know a comedian, you know fleshlight you remember flashlight. They, I guess they make these motorized flashlights now. Like we kinda just strokes you. Why you fucking so my friend a comedian, we know. I won't say who it is, but he injured his dick hole from, went too hard and went too hard and he had to go to the doctor and tell a terrible story. Jesus christ. Dude, that's terrible story. I kind of fleshlight dealer day. I haven't used one in a while. Do you still use yours? All right. I think this podcast is basically over. Brian just hit the wall. It's a. It's been a while. We were like three hours into it. I don't use it anymore. I always felt so much more shame using it that I did use my hand, but it does feel better. Way better. It does. That's legit. This traveling has are nice. We shoot through it so you don't even have to like clean it up anymore. You just shoot through it. He didn't make this whole mabel and what does this

Speaker 3:          02:55:04       guy made? A homemade dick soccer. Jesus christ. This looks terrible. He's got metal and ivc pipe. The pipe is cut at 45 degrees. Flashlight, pvc pipe the fuck out of here. He's got a. It's got like a little kid's toy train. It's going to shoot you right onto his dick. Let's go look at it. Nylon nuts, bolts, washers, aluminum, plywood, 12 volt power supply. One hundred and 50,000. Oh my god. Such a bad idea. He changed. That is hilarious. So it's gonna slowly bullshit. Oh, he can control the pace that it blows them. Proof of concept. Proof of concept. Yeah. Whatever, bro. Tighten the flesh. One motorized flashlight to see if what I did. That's how I got this one. Well, listen to the first. I think. I think we can wrap this up safely. I miss this. These are strange days.

Speaker 1:          02:56:02       I think we learned a lot today. I did not know that you could make a fucking phone call with an artificial intelligence thing that could say um, and would make appointments for you and shit. And we all learned that. That scared the shit out of me. I didn't know about these choo choo train fake vagina attractions that these kids are hacking is wacky kids. I learned that I'm not. I am very confused when it comes to the future. Very. This stuff is. I think this is all happening in front of us and I think it's insanely crazy, insanely transformative and it's happening and we don't have a fucking clue as to where it's going and there's nothing we can do about it. It's we're all like, well, it is what it is. I think it's nuts. I think we are. We're 20 years from the fucking matrix and we're seeing it happen. We're seeing it happen right now in front of us. We're seeing a little baby steps like, nah, nah, we're so far off. Yeah. I went to that whole thing the other day. It was nothing went to the conference. Nah, not that impressed me.

Speaker 3:          02:57:06       Which would you rather find out that we're about to be in it or that we've been in it the whole time? Which would make you more comfortable? That's a very good question. Damn, that's a good question. What do you think? I think we're already in it so

Speaker 1:          02:57:22       well. Gun to the head, which you do. Why would she say? I think the reality itself is obviously some sort of weird thing because you're looking at it, you looking at it through your eyes, your eyes are determining the positions that things are in and what they look like and where things are and there's all these things that are going on around you all the time that you have no control of and they're everywhere all over the planet. People living lives and you interface with those lives. Occasionally you just accustomed to the manner in which you do it, so it seems normal, but every night you close your eyes and you go unconscious and who knows what the fuck happens to your brain and then you wake up in the morning and you have to pee and you're struggling to try to figure out what happened yesterday and then while this is happening, your ex girlfriend's fucking your best friend from high school and they got together and can't believe jamie left.

Speaker 1:          02:58:10       I mean he said he was going to stay forever and then next thing you know like this is all these lives intersect with each other all over the world. It is kind of a hologram. It's kind of a crazy react. If the real life wasn't real, it would be super interesting. You'd be like, look at the way life works. Look at the way they breathe in and breathe out carbon dioxide and the trees breathe into carbon dioxide and breathe out air, but they keep chopping down the trees. They keep chopping down the trees. They don't care. They're like, who cares? I want paper to wipe my ass with a tree. Just wipe their ass with trees. Literally they grind millions of trees down every year and turned into pulp so they can make paper to wipe their ass. They literally wiped her ass with nature. Why don't they just use soap and water? No, no. I want a treat. I want some pulverized treated. Wipe my ass with tissue paper, tissue paper. It's fucking trees.

Speaker 1:          02:59:12       It's tissue paper really made out of trees. One hundred percent. Yeah. Synthetic tissue paper that's made out of like dolphin tears. Something worse. What are they, what it's like synthetic toilet papers that real. I mean, look, they have tofu chicken, right? You don't think they have like some sort of an organic plastic out of it? I think. Did they make toilet paper and would it be too rough? They'd be the best thing ever. Free free bathroom tissue. Hemp. Someone's doing it. So I'm putting it together. Is it a startup for you? Dude? I was. I was reading all the people that invested hundreds of millions of dollars into that scam. A blood test company. That blood test company story is crazy. Toronto's there was this woman and they were calling her like the next steve jobs, but the female steve jobs even dressed like I'm short black turtlenecks. Yeah, and she, she had become this self made person I think from college started this company and then by the time she was like 40, whatever she was when they busted her, she was worth $34,000,000,000 because there's blood testing thing that she had developed and then as time went on they realized that it didn't really work and then all these people had invested like betsy devos, I think it was.

Speaker 1:          03:00:40       And warren buffet had warren buffet invested over $100,000,000 or 25. Yeah. In this company that was bullshit. So these, they put these people's health at risk because they gave them these tests and the test didn't work and they're showing that they kind of knew the test didn't work with this is how this woman dressed all the time. It's um, it's really interesting, man. It's so really interesting story because when you see the amount of money that people invested into it and then they're just shit out of luck. She went from being worth. I think she was worth something crazy. Like the richest woman ever are the richest self made woman ever. Something along those lines is, I think she was worth like $34 million dollars at one point. Has a twitter. Yeah. And then she's recently been charged with massive fraud. I don't know. I mean I don't know shit about that business.

Speaker 1:          03:01:32       So I don't know if the blood tests did or didn't work or if she's got a store that needs to be told. And I don't know, it was just, it. Just read what you read and what you read is that they, they've fibbed about results and they did some shit they shouldn't have done and all these people got tests and they thought they were, you know, if you get a blood test, you think you're getting the accurate results from a reputable company. And it wasn't that, it was a micro click, like they would take like a micro prick of blood and they would take that blood and they would measure it and that's how they would find whether you had diseases or not.

Speaker 4:          03:02:03       Yeah, I use that one. All self made woman worth four and a half billion.

Speaker 1:          03:02:08       Okay. So why don't I save 34? So that's not even real. It has that much like three guys, a couple other people. Okay. So she's worth 4 billion. That's still nothing to sneeze at. It's like a two bedroom apartment remembered for I see a four. Is it your father? Who is it? Who is hitting the past? Um, so this, this, this thing, the store, when it came out that all these people that invested hundreds of millions of dollars into it, it made me think like, can you imagine how long it takes to make 100 million dollars to have 100 million dollars to invest in something that's bullshit. You imagine like what it must feel to find out that that shit didn't work. Like what? Like yeah, you invested in a scam. It's all bullshit. What? Yeah, she's being charged with massive fraud. No, no. Yeah, you're $100. Million dollars has gone. What? What the fuck did you just say your hundred million dollars is gone. They just got arrested. She got charged with massive fraud. What?

Speaker 4:          03:03:13       I said she's in prison is happening on the crypto market with the ico initial coin offerings. What's called. People will make some sort of pitch and pitch people that there are new startup is worth it and instead of taking investor money, they take cryptocurrency if you will. And then after they gain a bunch, they just disappear. It happens almost every week. Now

Speaker 1:          03:03:34       exit scammers run off with 660 million in ico earnings. See, this is like what you were saying about the nigerian people getting online and them not knowing certain scams and then we get. It's like scammers find a way in every system.

Speaker 4:          03:03:49       [inaudible]. There's not tons of scams out there. They're just getting repurposed, you know, that just another trick, they just put a little twist on it changes name and it's a new scam,

Speaker 2:          03:03:58       but it's, it's all the same scams. Actually. You might want to know my pistol scam postal. Yeah. I've actually never done this. But uh, it's like where you get arrested for what you're about to say. Well, I don't know. Well, I've been approached on a pit bull strong. Those motherfuckers come down on you. I've never done it, but this is something that uh, I think somebody told me they used to do in college. I don't know. I don't even know if it really works, but like I said, like I wanted to send you a letter a. I would put you as the uh, yeah, just switching return address and the address. Throw it in one of those blue mailboxes. Hey, they'll go, hey. No stamp returned to sender. Now I sent you that letter. Okay. They probably know that one already. Yeah, they probably. Do you do that with like a letter though? Probably. Yeah. Yeah. They're probably like, what? How do you get all the way over here?
