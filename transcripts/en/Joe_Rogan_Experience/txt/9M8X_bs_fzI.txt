Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Have you been here since he had a kid?

Speaker 2:          00:00:03       Yeah, I was here last, right about four months after I didn't sleep at all. It's amazing. I was able to talk for and now your kid is how old? Thirteen months. Wait till they start talking. He. Oh, he says, I mean he's, he's now his new thing is he says all done, all done. So he'll say it like he'll say it before I change his diaper because he doesn't want me to go through that. You know what I'm saying? Hold on, hold on. Don't say it like a lane his crib and say it like when he's ready to get out of bed early in the morning. And I'm like waiting. And I'm like maybe looking back to sleep

Speaker 1:          00:00:38       now being a scientist and having a child. Are you, are you like cognizant of like every single factor that's taking place like nutrition, all the input, emotional input environment must be kind of mind blowing

Speaker 2:          00:00:59       and mind exhausting too. Yes it is. I'll give you an example right now because we're traveling, right? And um, you know, I, I'm, I'm pretty this the BPA plastic bottles, you know, I'm having to give him water and he's like obsessed for whatever reason. He's obsessed with drinking. I brought his like, you know, nice cop, but he doesn't wanna drink it out of his cup, he wants to drink it, all these plastic bottles. It's novel and crinkly sound and anyways, you know, so I'm like all I can think about is the VPA and you know, am I, am I exposing them to too much and what's it doing? And is that BPA, is it leach only when it gets hot, is that how it works? So. And that's another thing I was thinking about in my hotel today, making a coffee with one of those, I'm one of those paper cups.

Speaker 2:          00:01:44       It has the plastic lining and like I don't know what's in the plastic lining, bpa or some of the BPA alternatives, which have also been shown to how does bpa stands for Bisphenol a. So to answer your question, there's been experiments done that have shown here. So boiling, boiling water and putting it in plastic increases the BPA that leeches into the solution into the water by like 55 fold. So yes, definitely heating up it was like way worse. And so one of the things I'm always now thinking about is, you know, going to starbucks, whatever the plastic lining they're putting in those cups when you get your hot tea or your coffee. I don't know if there's BPA, but there's now studies that have come out in these studies have been done in animals that show like bps and some of the other bp of replacements also have negative consequences on the endocrine system, on reproduction and some, in some cases they're passed onto multiple generations now.

Speaker 2:          00:02:41       How much of that is actually translates to humans? It's unknown, but there have been studies, at least with Bpa that have shown that, you know, you give a person a single dose of BPA and it disrupts their insulin sensitivity. It also plays a role in like I'm causing problems with in vitro fertilization, so disrupting hormones and things like that. So I was really cognizant about it during pregnancy because, you know, typically we do detoxify, detoxify it quite well. The half life is like less than five hours and we excrete it through urine. It also comes out through sweat by the way, which is really good. Um, but pregnant, but you know, when you're pregnant for whatever reason, the placenta, it, you know, you, you're basically take the BPA your body, it's in your body and your, your liver will inactivate it to this, like more benign compound.

Speaker 2:          00:03:34       But when it crosses over the placenta, it gets in, it gets activated again. And so it's like, that's why they effects are much more robust always on like the developing fetus. And so I was really made sure I was like not drinking anything out of a plastic bottle or anything like that, don't when I, while I was pregnant, just because, I mean, I don't know. Right. At the end of the day there's, there's a lot of studies that have been done in animals and just how much of that, you know, translate how significant is. It's really hard to say. Um, but it certainly concerned

Speaker 1:          00:04:02       it was probably a compounding effect, right, with all the other environmental factors, pollution, particulates in the air, chemicals, all the other jazz that we take into our body all the time.

Speaker 2:          00:04:12       Right? Yeah. And then the fact that actually aging bottles, like as you, for whatever reason, as a bottle sits, like if you keep using, for example, the study was done with baby bottles, if you keep using a baby bottle and putting liquid in as the bottle aged more BPA was leeched out into the liquid. So for whatever, I know it's just. So it's another thing I'm thinking about with all my son's stuff. It's like everything's plastic and he's chewing on. It's like, you know, at some point you just can't, like there's, you can't control everything. Right. How many kids do you think you're going to have right now? Um, one is, it's, I am so satisfied and full of so much joy and it's a lot of work. Um, and I, you know, he's 13 months, so I've, I've only had them a little bit over a year. So right now I'm, I'm really happy with him being special. I don't know, I think it's likely that maybe one, but I'm not gonna like, you know, say for sure it's, it's a lot of work. It's a lot of work. Yeah. And you know, it just adding another, it's like, well, you know, I've put a lot of energy and time, you know, spent a lot of time with him doing lots of things and of course all the nutrition and all that. But um, it's. How do you do that with too. It's,

Speaker 1:          00:05:24       it's very satisfying though. Watching them play with their siblings. It's really interesting. Like my two youngest, my eight and my 10, like watching them play together, it's, it's adorable watching them hold hands and do stuff together. That's really fun. Again, they developed a very unique bond. They fight all the time over nothing like Gimme that it's mine. It's my like in all of a sudden like, whoa, Whoa, whoa. What happened? You know, like there's always like some blow up because they have zero control of their emotions. Anything that goes on,

Speaker 2:          00:05:56       it's just a flood gate is either on

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       or it's off and but they're really good at apologizing too, which is really interesting. We've taught them how to do that. How to just say, look, everybody gets emotional. It's okay, apologize and hug it out and

Speaker 2:          00:06:08       yeah, I think it's also another thing that is really important in the teaching or your children how to be happy. Like you know, cause that's important.

Speaker 1:          00:06:17       They see that though they'll see that new, you know, the imitate their environment. If they see, you know, that you know how to be happy and that you can turn things around and you not to make light of situations and they'll, they'll, they take on these behavior patterns. Really, that's one of the more fascinating things is watching kids go, wow, what are you going to do? You know, like when you do, what are you going to do? And then you see them go on, Huh, what are you going to do? And you're like, wow. Watching an eight year old figured that out was kind of cool.

Speaker 2:          00:06:44       Yeah, that's nice. That's nice to know. Like right now, my son, he's almost always just happy, you know, and I'm thinking about like future he's going to girl problems and girl breaks, just anything, you know, where it's the thought, well if he's gay. Yeah. And that's where I'm like, you know, all the endocrine disruptors. Oh my God, I'm gay. Yeah. Who knows,

Speaker 1:          00:07:09       who knows what's happening. Yeah, I mean, and what's, what's of major concern to me is living in a major metropolitan areas with the constant pollution. And I was reading a study that was talking about living in any major metropolitan area like New York City can take many years off of your life just from living there. It will shorten your life.

Speaker 2:          00:07:32       Yeah. I've been reading multiple studies over the years about air pollution and you know, there's, there's compounds in air pollution that are carcinogens like benzine and there's also the particulate matter and how these, you know, how air pollution is, um, increasing the risk for stroke, heart attack, Alzheimer's disease. Um, and this is like in dose dependent manners and of course has all sorts of confounding factors and you can never really show causality, although some animal studies have been showing causality. Um, it's, and, and some of these things are really bad in developing nations that don't have a lot of regulatory regulations on, um, for example, like automobile exhaust and so some, some developing countries have like children coming down with strokes and stuff like early, like young teenage. So, um, and it's been, this has of course been linked to air pollution. Uh, so it's, it's definitely a concern and then there's all sorts of studies talking about, um, you know, of course asthma, but you know, happiness and, and, and bring function and all that, you know, so, and it's something like I live off of a busy road and then there's noise pollution, which is another.

Speaker 2:          00:08:40       I mean, so it's like something that I've been like really, really aware of and trying to like move out away from a busy traffic areas, particularly for my son, you know, because I'm just very concerned about the health risks.

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       Yeah. I wonder also the in the impact of just being in an urban environment and the fact that it's not really natural and that may be a person who's an adult could enjoy living in Manhattan and decide that they get a thrill out of living in the city, but for a baby to grow up around all that concrete and glass and all these sharp hard edges and right angles that it's maybe not conducive to healthy brain development or that's not like what your, what your body or your brain is naturally craving and there's been studies looking at, for example, like people that exercise and I metropolitan area versus like out in like a park nature and that, you know, all sorts of measurements of depressive symptoms that are measured after and the ones that measured or that nature or run. We're far better at, you know, basically feeling, feeling happier after after their run.

Speaker 3:          00:09:51       Then the people that didn't, metropolitan city. Does that make sense? No, I mean I think that's why people like central park in New York City was just say in a way asis. Yeah. You get something. I mean, it's really a great place. It's really quite big. One of the things about central park when you're in it, you're like, wow, this is weird that this is in the middle of the city, but it's a brilliant move to have this one area. I mean, you think about how much that real estate would be worth. It just said just to shove buildings in there. I mean Manhattan is one of the most pricey real estate places on the planet earth and yet in the middle of it they have this big open public park area that anyone could just wander around, sit by a tree. It's really a very, very smart move. It is, it is.

Speaker 3:          00:10:33       Nice. La should have something like that. Is the air pollution. Do you know if the air pollution with like in Manhattan? It's terrible, terrible in Manhattan to La. I think they're probably equally sucky, but the thing that is bothering me, um, is not just the air pollution in terms of like the exhaust fumes and exhaust the smells, but also the brake dust. You know, when I first started paying attention to brake dust and I would always clean it off my wheels, but I would never think about it like, oh, there's dust that's on my wheels. I would say, oh, it's just dust. And he was then someone was explaining to me to know that's an environmental hazard that you're breathing in. If you live in that environment, when you're around, know if you're on Broadway and cars are constantly hitting their breaks around you. There's a puff of that brake dust has getting in the air with every pump, the brakes, and you're just taking that disgusting stuff into your lungs. Yeah. That particulate matter, that's really tiny and stuff because that's like Mesothelioma, right? You're taking in the particulate matter from his bestest. So in the same you'd think there'd be similar mechanisms may not going to lead to immediate family, Oma, but that there would be similar mechanisms at play that are like, you know, damaging organs. Good to visit. Not good to stay. That's what I think. I mean, my. I have no desire. I don't even like living here.

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       I think there's too many people. Yeah, it's, I definitely don't like driving here, like it's like it's, it's really bad how much is the difference between here and we're in San Diego. San Diego is definitely bad during um, you know, the typical times people are either going to work or coming, coming home from work. Uh, but it's, it's, it's nothing like La. I mean la is orders of magnitude worse for sure. If you're not doing clinical research, you could do a lot of your stuff somewhere else. Have you thought about being somewhere else? Um, so my family's in San Diego and uh, it's really nice having my mom in particular because she helps out a lot with my son so that I can, uh, get some work done too, which is important and I really, we could live, you know, a little bit further out. I mean there's, there are places like that are still within like 40 minute drive to like, you know, downtown San Diego beaches and stuff that are, that are nice.

Speaker 2:          00:12:50       And um, so that is something that we are considering buying. We're just a little quieter, definitely quieter no matter what it's going to be. You know, because we live, there's just, it's a busy road and there's fire sirens and you know, my son likes the fire sirens, but there are, there have been times when there have been loud motorcycles and he is like, concerned, like you can see a look on it, like it's, you know, so, so it kind of worries me as well. Um, but definitely it's, it's, uh, it's, it's important to get away from that. It's a goal for sure. Now, before the podcast started, you were telling me that you wrote a 30 page paper on the Carnivore Diet. It's not a paper. Well, it's, I definitely spent a lot of time pages. I thought about it for a long time and yes, there's 30 pages of thoughts and references.

Speaker 2:          00:13:40       Were you stunned that this became, I mean, this is a very recent thing. Yeah. People were just eating meat. Well, at first, um, when I was, when I think Dan told me about it like a couple of years ago even, like, and I thought there's no way. I was like, I just ignored it. I don't have time for that. So yeah, I definitely, um, dismissed it when I, when I first heard about it, but it's definitely been something that has gained a lot of traction, you know, send it disturb you that it's getting traction. Well, I definitely have concerns. Um, I think that the, the most important question really is what is attracting someone to try such a very restrictive diet, you know, that potentially could be dangerous without published evidence or any sort of longterm studies and things like that. So I think that the first question really is, well, why are people doing this?

Speaker 2:          00:14:44       And so looking on the Internet and try to like read about people's anecdotes. Um, it seems as though a lot of people are drawn to it because they have some sort of autoimmune problem and so they try this diet and it improves their autoimmune symptoms and I see that seems to be a real common theme in at least if you, if you look in the blogosphere ears and stuff like that. Um, so that's, I think kind of a good place to start where it's like, well, you know, what are people doing this for? And then, uh, so that's, that's kind of an important question and I'm so, so further reading about this diet is sort of sort of think about, well, okay, well what's going on? It's really important when you have like something that leads to an effect to understand the mechanism because the mechanism is what's leading to this effect.

Speaker 2:          00:15:38       And so if you can do something that's potentially not so dangerous or risky, then understanding the mechanism will help you because then you can find other ways to do it. Right? And so, um, if you look at, at a published studies on people that eat low carb, high protein diets, which is pretty common, is that they're, there's changes that happen in a variety of different endocrine factors. I'm like, you know, you're less insulin that's changing your satiety and hunger hormones, Leptin and Ghrelin and people become more satiated and they actually eat less. And this has been shown in multiple studies so people actually eat less when they're having a higher protein diet, which makes sense to because protein is more satiating, uh, as well. Um, and also there's also been studies on what's called food habituation a, we're basically, so habituation is when you're constantly exposed to the same stimulus, you sort of have a decreased response to that stimulus where there's been intervention trials where people are given the same food every single day, both non obese and obese people versus people that are given the same food once a week.

Speaker 2:          00:16:42       And the people that are given the same food every single day that they start to eat less calories so they start to eat less. I'm naturally started to calorie restrict themselves. Um, so I mean, and that's, it's Kinda like a dietary monotony sort of thing. So I think there are any, if you read and the people out there on the blogs talking about this diet, they say I like I'm eating less, I only eat twice a day. I'm fasting. So that's, people are talking about that as well. So I think there's published evidence to kind of explain that. And also there's, you know, people saying, yeah, I eat less. So that's an important point because one thing that's really known to affect autoimmunity is caloric restriction. And fasting, like it's probably one of the most well known, um, technologies that you can intervene and have improvements in autoimmune disease.

Speaker 2:          00:17:30       So, um, some of that has to do with the fact that you can sort of reset your immune system. There have been animal studies and human studies, a lot of this done by Dr Valter Longo at USC. Uh, he's done some prolonged fasting. I'm in animals. And also there's been sort of like a fasting mimicking diet done in humans, which kind of a very low calorie diet. This is meant to mimic fast. Um, and those have shown that, um, you basically kind of crossover because fasting is a type of stress you crossover into this like stronger stress response where you're not only like cleaning away all the gunk in the size of the cells. People talk about a topic, you lot when they're talking about fasting, you clean away things like damaged piece of DNA, protein aggregates, things like that. Mitochondria that are damaged get cleared out.

Speaker 2:          00:18:18       But you also sort of start to clear away entire cells through a process called apoptosis. And in animal studies, what's been shown is that if you do, for example, a 72 hour fast, you can clear away about 30 percent of the immune system and that and, and, and we replenish it with like brand new healthy immune cells and literally like Oregon's shrink once during the fasting and then they have like re-expand because you're activating the stem cells and you're, you're, you know, basically replenishing all your damaged old cells with new ones. Um, will voltaren as shown in animal studies. Also, auto immune cells tend to be selectively killed off and replaced with non on immune cells. So he's also done a clinical study, a pilot clinical study with people with multiple sclerosis during this fast mimicking diet for one month, sorry for one week. And I'm there in their symptoms improved.

Speaker 2:          00:19:10       Also, a ketogenic diet was done side by side. And ketogenic Diet also improve symptoms of autoimmunity. So those both were done in humans. So I think that, um, you know, understanding that some of these mechanisms that are at play and that fasting itself and caloric restriction both have been shown to improve autoimmunity. You may be tapping into something there by eating less. That's one possibility. Um, in addition, there's been studies, clinical studies in humans were that were done. They were basically fasted for 24 hours every other day for 15 days, so they had like a total of seven days of fasting and these were also people with multiple sclerosis. And there's profound changes in the microbiome that started happening. And this was an in line with basically I'm having, you know, a lot of anti inflammatory cytokines basically producing immune cells that are really important for preventing autoimmunity called t regulatory cells.

Speaker 2:          00:20:05       So things like that. So that's another really important thing to consider is, you know, the microbiome because the microbiome has been linked to autoimmunity and multiple, multiple studies. I mean, it's been linked to arthritis. It's been linked to multiple sclerosis. It's been linked to other diseases like Parkinson's, which is not really autoimmune. But, um, and the point of this is that, you know, again, understanding mechanism and realizing, you know, there's other potential factors that could be leading to an effect, right? It's, it's actually, um, the, the changes in the microbiome are really important because there's actually been a few animal studies which have led to phase one, phase two and phase three clinical trials that have been done in humans. So I'm cumins with multiple sclerosis. We're treated with minocycline an antibiotic, and they've been basically the antibiotic was shown to improve symptoms of multiple sclerosis and because there there's good bacteria and bad bacteria that had been linked to autoimmunity and getting rid of getting rid of bacteria, you know, the bad bacteria is going to probably lead to improvements and that's what was shown in animal studies.

Speaker 2:          00:21:06       And then in human trials. So humans I'm taking with multiple sclerosis, taking motorcycling for two years. So basically they had improvements that delay the onset or progression of the disease. But then after two years those improvements went away probably because you're wiping out the microbiome and eventually you're also getting rid of the bad, the good bacteria and so that things are going to catch up. Right? So you're not just, you may be getting rid of some of the pathogenic bad bacteria with antibiotics, but eventually like you're also getting rid of good stuff. So long term, you know, you may not have those same improvements and that. And that's very interesting. I think it's really important point to understand, um, with, with something like changes, very profound changes in the microbiome when it comes to someone just eating meat. So one thing to keep in mind with, with the microbiome is that basically the bacteria really are good at adapting to their environment.

Speaker 2:          00:22:03       That's why the antibiotic resistance is such a big deal. And when you, there's been human intervention studies, when you take a human that goes from a high fiber diet to a low fiber, high protein or vice versa, you get changes in their gut microbiome that happened within 24 hours. So within an hour you actually start to have doubling of populations of bacteria and within 24 to 48 hours do you actually start to lose other. So basically other bacteria start to die off. And this is at the species level, it's really hard to change the Fila. The Fila is more linked to longterm dietary patterns. Eventually you can change as well. But, um, it's been shown that people that go from a, um, a more high fiber to a high protein diet, they have changed their microbiome and these changes are a lot of the microbiome bacteria that are fermenting a variety of fermentable fibers start to leave and you actually start to get bacteria cropping up that ferment amino acids.

Speaker 2:          00:22:59       So the amino acids, amino acids, simple sugars, fats, those are mostly absorbed in the small intestine, but some of them make their way into the large intestine. And there's a whole, you know, group of bacteria called the putrifactive bacteria. And they ferment amino acids. And some of these species of putrifactive bacteria has been linked to colon cancer. There are much higher in colon cancer patients. Animal studies have shown, you know, causal links where they can basically regressively cause a polyp to form a tumor. And that's because these bacteria are making things called racine and cadaveric, which are damaging their genotoxic agents that damaged the DNA inside your colon cells. And so, um, people that are typically eating like an omnivore type of vibe where they're eating protein and they're also eating fermentable fiber if they're eating the fermentable fiber that's facilitating the growth of lactic acid producing bacteria, it, that limits the growth of putrifactive be so if you're, if your bifidobacteria, lactobacillus, s mutans as Thermophilus, those strains of bacteria are elected acid producing bacteria, which you'd be getting if you're, I mean, you, you'd be facilitating the growth of if you're eating plants, mental fermentable fiber, you're going to limit the growth of putrifactive because they can't grow with lactic acid.

Speaker 2:          00:24:20       So it's not like, it's not a huge, huge concern. But the question is what happens when you're only eating when you're only getting immuno acids, you know, so is there a longterm? So if you're, if you're, if you're killing off potentially some of this pathogenic bacteria and you're having this effect, a positive effect, what's going to happen long term? It's not known. I mean, this data, I mean, it hasn't really been studied at that level,

Speaker 4:          00:24:46       been a few people that have, have anecdotal stories about doing it for 10, 20 years that are online, but it's very difficult to track, you know, I mean, it's, it's that you have take them at their word for it. They eat nothing but meat for 20 years and they feel amazing, but there's not very many of them. There's a, there's a, well, there may be more out there, but it's in terms of like what I've come across articles, um, you know, just a social media profiles, people to talk about the positive benefits of it. It seems to me that most people that are talking about the positive benefits are talking about it within a one and two year window. That's what we're really dealing with a lot of. Um, Sean Baker, Dr Sean Baker who is probably the leading proponent of it, or one of the poster boys of it, along with Jordan Peterson and his daughter Mckayla, a Jordan Peterson, his daughter Mckayla.

Speaker 4:          00:25:33       They're different in that they were dealing with severe autoimmune issues. Uh, his daughters had two joints replaced, but before she was 18 she had her, well she had her ankle replaced before she was 18 and I think she had her hip replaced shortly after that and um, Jordan has had some pretty severe autoimmune issues and depression within with both of them, those things were cleared up, but as you've talked about multiple times before on this show, depression has been linked to disorders in the gut biome. Right. And this is something that you feel like may be contributing to this as long as, as well as both of them also got very lean. Jordan lost a ton of weight. He's back to the weight that he was when he was 25 years old and I've eaten with him and the guy eats, he eats a lot, but it's a lot of meat just like he'll eat like a 30 ounce steak, you know, which is just crazy. It's a crazy amount of meat. But, um, I don't know how many times he's doing that a day. I don't know.

Speaker 2:          00:26:34       Yeah, yeah, I think I, you know, going back to the, the, the point, it's like there are other, you understanding the mechanisms is and there's a lot of potential confounding factors, right? And that with any anecdotal data is extremely important to consider. I mean, people can't even neutral, you know, scientists, nutritionists, just people can't even agree on the best diet because a lot of these epidemiological and observational studies which don't establish causation, have an enormous amount of confounding factors and it is freaking, it's so hard to like control for that. I mean just as a perfect example, we've talked about this before on the podcast, but you know, the vegetarian versus people that eat meat, one of the really large studies that was done and, and, and Dr Valter Longo was part of that study looked at all cause mortality and cancer mortality and it was lower and vegetarians, but they decided to take the mediators and say, okay, what about within this group?

Speaker 2:          00:27:31       The people that are healthy meat eaters are people that are, you know, not, you know, not unhealthy. So they're not obese. They're not sedentary, they're not smoking, the not alcohol, not excessively drinking alcohol. Those people, when they took out that, those confounding factors, the mediators had the same mortality as a vegetarian, same cancer. So confounding factors are so important and that with anything with anecdotal, you have people that are exercising like crazy. Exercise is also been shown to change microbiome, independent of diet, um, in a positive way where you're actually producing more of the bacteria that are producing things like lactic acid. So in fasting does the same thing. And so you have people that are fasting. So, you know, it's not like you can't do other things if you're on that type of bed to, to sort of help with the microbiome. But I think again, if there's a way you can do, you know, if there's a way that you can get these benefits without having to do something.

Speaker 2:          00:28:24       So hyperdub restrictive and we'll talk about. I mean, I have concerns for that. We can definitely get into that. But um, then why not try that? And you know, the thing with like, for example, doing like a prolonged fast, you know, once, once a quarter, once every couple of months, depending on how severe your your issues are. I mean there's, there's been benefits shown with that, like an aging, like, you know, so people that have been put on this fasting mimicking diet, they have improved biomarkers of aging. Um, they increase their lean muscle mass. I mean, so like I said, an animal studies and you can't directly translate the animal studies to humans because rodents have a really fast metabolism and if you fast them for 48 hours, they lose 20 percent of their body weight where humans only losing one or two percent. I mean, that's like clearly, you know.

Speaker 2:          00:29:09       Yeah. Yeah. So you can't, I mean obviously you can't completely translate everything that's done in a fascinating roden to humans. But there are definitely organs are shrinking. And then literally we growing after the fast is over. Like it's like this rejuvenation process. And it seems as though selectively damage cells are killed. In fact, this whole, like there's a whole, um, Dr Valter Longo showing that cancer cells are really, really susceptible to dying when they're, when you do like a prolonged fast, even a fasting mimicking diet, and he's, he's, he's shown this an animal studies and you send a couple of clinical studies were, were patients with cancer were treated with standard of care, but before their standard of care treatment, they were faster to for up to 72 hours. And what happens, what he shown in animal studies happens is that because the fasting is a type of stress, all your healthy cells increase all these stress response pathways.

Speaker 2:          00:30:04       They make more heat shock proteins. They're increasing antioxidant production pathways, antiinflammatory. They're doing all this really good stuff in response. Cancer cells can't do that. They're like screwed up. And so they can't activate the stress response pathway. So it ends up killing them. So what you end up happening happening happening is that when you're giving another genotoxic stress like chemo or radiation, your healthy cells become more resistant to the damaging effects of the radiation. And the cancer cells become more sensitized to the death. And so what he's shown him in his pilot studies in humans is that basically, um, the humans that were, that were, that were treated with the standard of care, I think it was chemo and also fasted, they had less neutropenia, which is the loss of like neutrophils, which is the side effect because you're losing normal healthy cells. So they had less of that happening, less myelosuppression. So I mean anyways, the point is that I think if you can find a way to get positive benefits, you know, without having to do something so risky and potentially dangerous and unstudied, um, you know, in a unstudied in a really scientific way of controlling for contract compounding factors and all sorts of longterm. I mean, just all of that is really important.

Speaker 4:          00:31:15       Well then just comprehensive breakdown that you just did is something that's really lacking from a lot of discussion of this carnivore diet. And from the proponents of it, it's almost like a lot of them are going into it blindfolded. They'll like, look, it seems to be working. So I'm just going to stick with it. But again, when you're talking about most people's cases, you're talking about one year, maybe two years, sometimes even less, where they're having these benefits and as you're saying, it's entirely possible that they're setting themselves up for some potential longterm damage.

Speaker 2:          00:31:51       It is. Um, it is definitely possible. And again, at the end of the day there's no data, there's no data. So you can say for sure, right, there's no data, but I have concerns and we can talk about those concerns for sure. I would like to. But you know, the thing is understanding mechanism, like you said, going in blindly. I mean you have a hypothesis and it's like, okay, your hypothesis is all plants are bad. That's what I keep hearing. And it's like, well that's a hypothesis, but what about all the other things that are potentially happening while you're doing this diet and you're fasting more, your microbiomes changing dramatically changing. And those things all have been known. Multiple studies have shown that humans and animals mechanistic detail to have benefits on autoimmunity, on aging in general, on brain function. I mean all sorts of things. You know. So it's mechanism is so important, you have to realize that that's the whole basis of science, understanding how the world works around you, understanding how your body works, mechanisms like you have hypothesis and it's very, and I understand it's like someone experiences something positive. It's like well this must be, this is it, this is the end all be all and. But you have to realize the shits complicated. You got to understand the mechanism and you may be doing something a longterm that potentially. I mean it really hasn't been studied.

Speaker 4:          00:33:14       Yes. So. Well that was one of the. I mean I had Jordan's daughter Mckayla on who's had some pretty dramatic results from this carnivore diet, but she's giving essentially nutrition consulting to people, but she doesn't really have a background in it and she's in. She doesn't have the information that you just distributed, like what you just said to all these people listening, the way you're describing the, the mechanisms and the benefits of fasting and all these different various things that are happening inside of your gut and all these different things that are happening with healthy cells and damaged cells with fasting and that this is mimicked by this restrictive diet. And then this is all absent from the dialogue. This is all absent from the dust and this is one of the things that's disturbing the most disturbing for me. It's like I get that they're seeing positive results.

Speaker 4:          00:34:04       I cannot deny that they're receiving, but when they start saying, uh, you know, plants are bad and there's a, you know, like my friend Chris, he's always talking about the war on carbs. He's having real. He's also got Chris Bell. He's got autoimmune issues as well. He's had both of his hips replaced before he was 35 and you know, severe arthritis and he is leaner than he's ever been and benefiting greatly from this carnivore diet. But you know, he's, he's like, he talks about, he uses Hashtag war on carbs, you know, and he doesn't eat salad, he won't eat greens. I think Greens are bad for you. And I'm like, man, I don't not sure that's correct. I think it's so important what you're saying. And um, there's a, uh, a researcher online that I've been in contact with names Kevin Bass and his bass or bass be ass, not sure what, how do you pronounce it? But he also brought up this possibility that it could be a calorie restriction that these people are dealing with this essentially some of the same mechanisms that are the positive reactions from fasting that you're, you're dealing with here. And I'm very happy that you're saying the same thing.

Speaker 2:          00:35:18       Yeah, I, I think that is one very strong possibility. And that is something, you know, there's lots of hypotheses here and you know, given all the data and there's lots of positive data about eating plants as well, you know. So it's, it's really hard. That's one hypothesis and that seems to be the one everyone's sort of gravitating to. Um, you know, if, if someone's also wanting to reduce their, their glycemic load and all that, I mean there's, there are other, I mean eating just a modified Paleo Diet. I mean I eat something like a modified Paleo Diet where it's like I'm eating, I'm eating fish and meat, meat, poultry and a lot of leafy Greens and cruciferous vegetables. Now you can do and nuts or you can do a ketogenic diet. Like they're like I just talked about the study that was done looking at the fasting mimicking diet and humans with multiple sclerosis, sclerosis.

Speaker 2:          00:36:09       Um, there was uh, the same in publishing the same paper. There was a study they study that put patients on Ketogenic Diet for, I believe it was three months and it improves symptoms of autoimmunity as well. Was it comparable? Yeah, yeah. Improvement. Yeah. Yeah. Interesting. So you know, the key to genic die a modified ketogenic diet is also, you know, there's also concerns with that. Not everyone responds very well and you know, the micronutrient deficiencies have been a concern, but you can actually eat a lot of vegetables, vegetables, green, a good ones that are, that are low and glycaemic. So my concern exactly, my concerns are much, much less, um, and it's been studied a lot more. I mean, at least there's been lifespan studies in animals on ketogenic diet where it's like improving, you know, the way they age, it's improving their cognitive function, brain aging, extending their lifespan.

Speaker 2:          00:37:00       So, you know, if people are looking for, in addition to wanting to like help with their auto immunity issues, you know, there's also, if it's like, well, I also just don't want to have a lot of insulin response. I want to lower my glycemic levels and things like that. Um, it seems like a much better option than, than doing something completely unstudied. Right. And so, um, you know, I think that's a really good place to start and obviously not disregarding everyone's anecdotes. And of course there's also the placebo and no cpl effect, which are very real. I mean extremely well real. It's why a lot of drugs don't ever make it to market is because they can't beat placebo. You know where it's like, people think they're going to get a positive response from something they can write and the opposite is true. People think they're going to get a negative response for something.

Speaker 2:          00:37:50       They can just got to be a way to market it. The placebo effect in a pill form. I think it's great. I think so, and what's interesting is that genetics determines that there's snips. Gene, basically single nucleotide polymorphisms where changes in the sequence of DNA in a certain gene makes it function a little differently. While the gene that's really important seems to be really important for either whether or not you're going to have a placebo versus no CBO isn't controls dopamine, the degradation of dopamine, so people that are really likely to placebo response have more dopamine in their brain. It's called comp t, the snip and the genes called comp t. people that have less dopamine are more subject to the no cbo and this has been shown in dose dependent manner in intervention, intervention trials, randomized control in humans and not. It's not a diet.

Speaker 2:          00:38:38       There's been studies on diet as well as showing like no CBO effects, so people think they have a gluten sensitivity, which I do think that's a real thing. I mean I'm not saying non CELIAC gluten sensitivity. I think there's enough evidence that showed that does exist. However, there was this great study that was published four years ago showing people that thought they were, you know, having gluten sensitivity issues. They were, they were randomized and none of them were given gluten, but they didn't know that. They thought maybe there's a chance I'm going to get the gluten. I don't know I'm being randomized. Of course they had a negative response. They had distended bloating, pain, but there was no glue. So the no cbo effect is also real and that's something to keep in mind as well. If you think, you know, I'm going to have a bad response if I eat these plants, you can fit there.

Speaker 2:          00:39:26       Yeah, it's definitely, it's definitely a real thing. I think placebos much better. I think that's a great, like it's a great thing that, that exists. Especially if you could figure out a way to trick yourself. You're changing dopamine levels that affects your immune system. I mean it affects a chiropractor who was banking on that. He was doing something called zone healing and the more I pressed him on this, the more he basically said, well, if you believe that it works, I'm like, okay, so you're saying that it doesn't work unless you tricked this person into believing that it works, so you're a trickster is what you're doing. He didn't want to go that far, but that's essentially, there's no real scientific basis to this idea that you press on someone's back and fix the thyroid. I absolutely think that placebo accounts for a lot of that stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:40:13       Yeah. And again, Reiki, all that shit, all of it. And I think that um, the, the, the genetic snips involved really they do play a role. Is there a diet that increases dopamine because there's. You can increase serotonin with htp and to fan which converts to htp five htp what is. Is there anything that ramps up your dope? You know, what does in the prefrontal cortex is fish oil. In fact, schizophrenia, schizophrenia, schizophrenia, patients are prescribed a really high dose because they, they lack, they're doping means lower and the prefrontal Cortex, and this is sort of associated with a lot of the negative paranoid, delusional sort of. When you say high dose, what are you talking about? Oh, like six grand. Three. Anywhere between three to six grams a day. And what does a normal dose? Well, if you look at, if you're talking about normal in the sense where what's typically used in like a randomized controlled trial, it's like one, one, one or two grams. What is recommended? People like Usta or what would you recommend? Like there's no recommended nothing. It's not now because because what's recommended is the. So there's a plant version of it, Alpha linoleic acid, because you can convert that into the marina, the marina omega three fatty acids, Dha and EPA. Uh, that's the one that's recommended, so it's like the, what you essentially need, right? So, so that's the one that's recommended, but they were concern about

Speaker 4:          00:41:34       potential heavy metal poisonings when you're taking in fish oil or is that all, all that stuff? Do they know how to filter that stuff out?

Speaker 2:          00:41:41       It's definitely purified out and I mean it depends on the fish, the fish while you're getting your, your fish oil from. But there's, there's, there's um, international fish oil standards organization. Uh, there's a lot of different fish oil companies, um, are tested by them and they show their, all their arsenic, mercury, pcbs and dioxins, like all those, you know, potentially harmful compounds. And they also look at oxidized polyunsaturated fatty acids for the looking at total oxidation and things like that. So that's a really good site to use to look at whether, you know, your fish oil brand is

Speaker 4:          00:42:19       years in the pill form or do you do like Carlson's where you get in the bottle and take spoonfuls of it?

Speaker 2:          00:42:25       So I get mine in the pill form because I have a friend that makes it in Norway and he sort of has convinced me that it's really good. So I really liked his fish oil and he doesn't make it in the liquid form. Um, but I do. So I take, I take about like five or six grams a day. I take a lot. Wow. Five or six grams. Yeah. And I'm taking like a high dose Dha because um, it gets into breast milk and I haven't 100 percent. When did my son just yet? How many pills is five or six grams? Um, it's like, oh, that I take. So I'm taking six, six pills. The pills or grant? Yeah. Wow. So, um, that is high dose. It's really high dose. It's really, it's really good. Fisher. It's not, he, it, he's working on getting it available in the United States. Uh, I think that's supposed to happen like in the next couple of months. But um, I used to take Carlson's Carlson's was a bottle. Yeah, that's what I take. Yeah. Because you take a lot, right? Yeah. So, yeah. But I'll take three tablespoons. I thought that was a lot. How much is in wondering idea? We'll have to talk about my, my Alzheimer's will make it three publication that we still have time.

Speaker 4:          00:43:36       Carnivores stuff. Let's keep going. I'll put that aside because I actually have a good friend whose dad has Alzheimer's and I sent her your clip from your instagram from yesterday. Oh, cool. About that too. Yes. Yeah, yeah, we will.

Speaker 2:          00:43:52       I'll send you my paper. It was just accepted. Um, and uh, it should be out online this month, late sometime this month. But um, okay. So, okay. My potential concerns with carnivore diet, um, you know, I think, I'm sure, I mean I know this, I've seen it all over the blogosphere, is that, you know, the, the micronutrients and you know, they don't really matter. They're rda is, weren't set for carnivores and all this, all this stuff that I've read. But I think to start out like understanding, you know, micro nutrients are essential about 30 vitamins and minerals that are really important. They, they do run our metabolism, they are involved in making neurotransmitters. They're involved in, you know, pulling calcium out of our arteries and Brittany tour bones, they're involved in all sorts of things. People when they hear the word metabolism, they always just think about, you know, food you eat, it's like metabolism refers to a lot of things.

Speaker 2:          00:44:43       And there's about 22, I'm sorry, there's 22 percent of all your enzymes in your body require a micronutrient to function. Um, and this is repairing damage from Dna, all sorts of things really important. Um, and so there's about 30 of them that are essentially you have to get them for your diet because you don't make them in your body and if you don't get them from your diet, it can lead to health problems and death actually. So, so that's, that's kind of, you know, what micronutrients are Rda. So recommended dietary allowance, um, those have been set, a variety of different studies are used. So there's randomized controlled trials, non randomized controlled trials, there's depletion, depletion studies, there's balance studies. Looking at how much, how long, how much of a micronutrient it takes before you start reading it. Um, there's cross sectional studies and there's case studies and this is a collaboration between the United States and Canada and some European countries as well.

Speaker 2:          00:45:40       So a lot of experiments are done to, to figure out the recommended dietary allowance. The first thing that's done is the, the estimated average wreck, the s e a ear, the estimated average wreck, um, intake. So that is done by basically looking at any population and going, okay, how much of this micronutrient do we need? So that 50 percent of the population has adequate levels, the other 50 percent will be deficient. So like there's a bell curve. And so it's like literally in the middle of the bell curve and then the RDA is set from that two standard deviations above. And it's supposed to make about 97 point five percent of the population gets enough. So that's how the Rda set for each micronutrient. It's different than the experiments are done, are different to look at them. So there's a few concerns, of course, with an all meat diet with particular micronutrients, because you know, micronutrients, there's a lot of, you know, certain micronutrients that are concentrated in meat and there's a lot that are concentrated in plants and you can find some of the ones that are more concentrated in meat in plants, most in most cases, um, but it's much better to get it from the meat and implants.

Speaker 2:          00:46:48       There's, it's much more concentrated, you know, and you can find it in some amounts in meat, but it's much, you know, it's a lot easier to get it from plants. So, uh, one of the, of course, the micronutrients that the concern is the vitamin C, of course, right? That's, that's the one that everyone talks about.

Speaker 2:          00:47:05       So vitamin C is a really important cofactor for what that means as cofactor just means that it's binds to an enzyme and helps it work. It's important for making Collagen. It's important for converting dopamine into norepinephrine, which is important for that, you know, flight or flight response. Um, it plays a role in, and I'm making carnitine which is important for using fatty acids for, it's for energy. Um, and then of course an antioxidant. It also plays a really important role in, in neutrophils. Their neutrophils are a type of immune cell when they're activated, when you have any sort of bacterial exposure, um, virus, uh, things that can even come from the gut, you know, like Lps, we get from dead bacteria that are dying in the gut. Neutrophils get activated and they soak up vitamin C because they release a bunch of hydrogen peroxide which damages the neutrophil itself.

Speaker 2:          00:47:57       And so the vitamin C's sort of prevents that from happening, uh, plays a really important role in cell cell integrity and things like that. So the, the um, there's a variety of ways and vitamin C is transported into the cell. And I see a reading on the Internet, a little bit of misunderstanding. People following the carnivore diet seem to think that because they're not getting any, uh, their glucose levels are low, that they're getting more vitamin C in. So, so vitamin C, I'm also called ascorbic acid. A goes between two different states or scorebig acid is the reduced form which has the antioxidant form. It goes also into an oxidized form, so it's kind of going back and forth. It goes through about four cycles of that, the oxidized form, it's called dehydroascorbic acid, and there's two ways that you transport vitamin C, you absorb it to the gut.

Speaker 2:          00:48:49       Epithelial cells is transported into a variety of tissues in the body. Ascorbic acid goes through sodium dependent vitamin C transporters. Those are not dependent on glucose. There's no competition for glucose. The that's, that's how vitamin C gets into the cell, and most cells actually transport vitamin C in that form with the exception of red blood cells, which don't have that transporter. They use another transporter called glucose transporters or glute, and that one does. Glucose does compete. Interestingly, dehydroascorbic acid binds much better. Uh, it's actually slightly more by binds to the transporter. Then I'm glucose. But in conditions like, um, hyperglycemia, like type one or type two diabetics, they actually don't get vitamin C into the red blood cells and it leads to like vascular problems and stuff like that. So, so, um, it's an interesting hypothesis that maybe if you're having, you know, less of a, um, your blood glucose levels are really bottomed out.

Speaker 2:          00:49:45       Maybe there maybe that there's some salvage pathway, you're able to help get vitamin C in the oxidized form is going in some other cells that usually doesn't go in or whatever, something like that. It's an interesting hypothesis, which is there's no data on, right. But the experiments that were done to choose the rda for vitamin C, we're done, um, the, the more recent rda so that it changed back in like two that after 2000 or 2001 or something, it's about 90 milligrams a day for men and 75 for women, they were, they were depletion repletion studies. So men were, were given about less than five milligrams a day of vitamin C, you die with their diet. And this was about a six months to study. There were in a metabolic ward. And, um, it was determined that it was kind of unsafe to keep, to keep going.

Speaker 2:          00:50:34       So, so basically they started the repletion where they started giving, uh, the, these men, vitamin C at different doses and a vitamin C follows like a sigmoidal s curve. So once you kind of deplete someone in their vitamin C, when you give them, for example, 30 milligrams, it isn't really enough to kind of go, it doesn't really raise plasma levels much. You have to get up to 100. Once you get up to 100, then you actually start to excrete vitamin C. But before that you're just, your body's holding onto everything or not excluding anything. Two hundred milligrams was a maximum bioavailability. And then after that, um, you start to decrease bioavailability. New York screening a lot of identity. So the, the new. So the scientists that published this paper, Mark Levine at the Nih, um, recommended that the RDA be set at 200 milligrams, but it was set at 90, which is literally right before you start to excrete, which was 100 milligrams.

Speaker 2:          00:51:29       That data, along with the neutrophil data, there were some neutrophil data that was looked at. Um, you know, how much vitamin C was it important to. Because neutrophil sop it up to prevent that hydrogen peroxide induced damage. And so that's kind of how the RJ was said. I'm now the question is in any, with any Rga, like, you know, the important thing to consider is well the rds are set to prevent acute disease, but what about promoting optimal health? You know, like that's really important. Like how much are these micronutrients you need throughout our lifespan to, to, you know, to maintain optimal health and age. Well, so this is something that's really important because a lot of enzymes that require micronutrient for preventing short term disease, something that can kill you. Like there's also enzymes that are required to prevent, you know, things that are associated with aging, like DNA damage.

Speaker 2:          00:52:21       So if there's only so much of a micronutrient around which, where's it gonna go, is it going to go where the, you know, is it going to prevent any damage which doesn't make a difference until five or six decades later? Or is it gonna make sure you live on to pass on your genes and you know, reproduce. And so, um, my former postdoctoral mentor, Dr Bruce Ames, proposed this whole and he has published a couple of foundational papers supporting this idea, which he calls the triage theory. So he's saying that basically he thinks actually a lot of our days are too low and that, you know, optimal rdas will account for how much is needed for these longterm functions. So that's really important to consider with the vitamin C, um, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's really a small amount that's needed to, to be used as a cofactor for, you know, an enzyme for Collagen production and you actually don't need that much.

Speaker 2:          00:53:14       And it was done like studies were done years and years ago with that established like 10 milligrams of vitamin C was enough to prevent scurvy, which can happen when you're basically, you don't have enough vitamin C for, for college and production. And, um, and even that's kind of questionable because back at the time when those studies were done, it was before really good analytical essays were available. So, you know, the asset that was done to measure, um, various things were, it was lots of things could confound, so it may even be less, maybe more, maybe less. It's kind of not known. So, um, you know, that, that, that is something to consider as well as the fact that basically there's a lot of biological variation with vitamin C requirements and this has been shown in other animals that also require vitamin C, like Guinea pigs. So like if you take 100 Guinea pigs and this is published back in the sixties or seventies, um, like there was like 10 fold variation in how much each of them required vitamin C they required even though they were given like, wow.

Speaker 2:          00:54:13       Yeah. So tenfold. Tenfold. Yeah. So there's huge variation in the half life of vitamin C and in their transporters. And so this has been shown in rodents as well. Rodin's make vitamin C and their liver. But the same thing has been shown. And actually back when this, the European sailors were getting scurvy and dying of it, only about 50 percent. Only about half of those dealers got scurvy. The other 50 percent didn't have any symptoms, presumably because not getting scurvy. That's what I'm saying. I'm saying that, you know, for one it doesn't take much. Right. Or getting some of it from me. Yeah. Yeah. And so, so the thing, you know, it, it, it doesn't take much to, to maintain the enzymatic function of some of the, some of the enzymes involved in making Collagen and that, you know, so it doesn't take much for that. But the question is about what about, you know, all the host of all the factors and the neutrophils and um, you know, your body stores like orders of magnitude more vitamin C than then than it needs for that, for the, for its function as a cofactor.

Speaker 2:          00:55:17       And it's like why does it do that? Is it just because maybe during scarce food scarcity you want and wants to make sure it has enough or is there are, you know, the antioxidant functions and other functions really important or other unknown functions. So I think the vitamin C, you know, there are certainly, you know, getting enough to prevent scurvy and there could be biological variation in that as well. Right? You don't need much to prevent scurvy in the junior. You're dealing with a very small sample size. You don't know how many people are actually on this or supplementing, right? How many of them are supplementing and why wouldn't they be right. Yeah, exactly. Um, when you think that a lot of these issues could be prevented with just multivitamin and supplementation. Well, I mean, I think the best thing is to get it from food and we'll talk through it.

Speaker 2:          00:55:59       Yeah. Um, you know, so the, the, there's another one that's potentially risky and that is vitamin E, which kind of vitamin D helps recycle vitamin C and vitamin C helps recycle vitamin E and vitamin e actually, um, most people think of as an antioxidant, which it does, it prevents a lot of oxidative chains. It's kind of breaks the chain of oxidation, but also is really important for maintaining cell integrity. And that's how the Rda was chosen for that one. So, um, how does it do that? So it's important for inside the cell membrane, so it's, uh, it's important antioxidant inside the cell membrane and so it's preventing a lot of oxidative factors that are happening just from normal metabolism, normal, what's happening. You and I are doing it right now, a DNA damage that damage our DNA. It also damages the Lipitz in our, in our cell membranes.

Speaker 2:          00:56:46       And so, and so vitamin E, it plays a really important role in the integrity of it. And so, um, the experiments that were done for choosing the RDA for vitamin E, we're two and a half years long and um, men were given three milligrams of vitamin E, so the RDA is 15 milligrams. So they were given three and after two and a half years they started getting hemolysis of the red blood cells because they're red blood cell. Um, the membranes of the red blood cells weren't being maintained very well. After two and a half it took two and a half years. It's a long time for, you know, for this to show up. And so, um, for whatever reason, it was decided that having hemo license happen lower than 12 percent is okay, 12 percent was the cutoff. And so they, when they did the depletion studies, it was 15, it was actually 12 milligrams and then for the ear and they went up two standard deviations and found 15.

Speaker 2:          00:57:37       Basically the RDA was at 15. So the question becomes, well right, so vitamin D you can, you know, you can get some vitamin E if you're eating some egg yolks and butter and if you're eating some fish but you're not going to, it's really hard to get 15 milligrams from, from those sources. And, and then if you're eating that, what about all the other stuff you have to eat to get your other, you know, so it is a good source of nuts are really, really the best source. Like almonds, like 100 grand, 100 grams of almonds with like give you your rda. Really good source. Um, so, uh, so the question becomes, well, okay, you know, what happens if I'm only getting seven milligrams a day, is it going to take, you know, six or seven or eight years before my cell membrane integrity is compromised more, you know, what you know.

Speaker 2:          00:58:22       So it's just, there's a lot of important questions to think about, you know, and it's like these rdas I would even argue they're set too low in some cases where you're really trying to just prevent things like that are like hemolysis, lysis of the red blood cells. And so what about all these other longterm effects? Um, you know, enzymes that are involved in DNA repair for example. And another one would be like fully a full eight. You can get if you eat, if you're eating like 150 grams of cooked beef liver every day. But like who does that? You know, I mean, and if you're not doing that and you're eating, you got to eat like you're 48 starting to get your vitamin E and you've got, you know, so it's like, it's not easy. And I'm not saying you can't get, you know, some amounts of it, but you may not be getting the RDA.

Speaker 2:          00:59:06       And so foliate plays a very important role in actually making new DNA, you know, if you don't have full eight, you essentially incorporate something from rna called Eurocell into DNA and all your like Dna polymerases and stuff. We're cruising along and see and then make a nick in the DNA and it literally, you know, it's a, it's a nick, it's like uh, in your, in your DNA. And if you have it, DNA is double stranded. It's, we have it on two ends, the DNA, what you do, because it's really important to make one of the nucleotides timing. Then you know, you're going to have a double stranded break. And actually my former postdoctoral mentor, Dr Bruce Ames, published a study showing that if you take animals and um, make them deficient in full eight or give them really, really low levels of full late, it causes strands and their dna just like being irradiated.

Speaker 2:          00:59:50       Like he compared them side by side. It was east exact same thing. And then he published a study that was with humans showing that actually humans that are getting really low levels of full late also had a certain type of DNA damage called micro nuclei. You know. So the question is, well, you know, if I, if I'm getting only so much fully, you know, is, is it something happening to my dna, my getting strand breaks. The same goes for magnesium. I mean, you can get magnesium if you're eating, you know, this, it's just been, what about the day? And then what about the bottom e? But you know, so it's really hard. It's really hard, uh, to, to do that. And Dna damage, that's something you can't measure it. You're not going to go. Your Lipid panel isn't going to tell you that there's no consumer test available.

Speaker 2:          01:00:36       There was a few years ago with a startup tried doing it, but it's really hard because there's, if you're sending blood samples to a lab to be tested for DNA damage. I have done many dna damage experiments on humans. So clinical studies. I was involved in Dr Ames lab. Um, and I've done studies, kinetic studies where we took blood out of a patient measure DNA damage immediately or frozen down, or we let it sit on a bench for 30 minutes, two hours, four hours overnight after two hours, all the tons of DNA damage that had come up because it's being exposed to the oxygen and all that is I'm creating basically DNA damage. So anyways, the point is, is that DNA damage isn't something you're going to measure. You don't feel it and you're not going to feel it. I mean, it's happening in us right now. We don't know how many, but it is.

Speaker 2:          01:01:24       We have enzymes that are repairing that damage and those enzymes require magnesium. We're getting enough folate to make sure that that damage isn't happening. And again, you can get a good amount of full liver is one of the best is really great source, but you have to eat it every day and you have to like, you know, I guess 150 grams of livers, not that much, but you have to eat it every day, you know. Um, so it's, it's just really important to consider these, you know, the fact that these micronutrients are important, they have longterm effects. I mean the two and a half years it took to show the hemo license and red blood cells two and a half years. So what happens if you're getting a modest amount, not quite three milligrams, but you're getting twice that or maybe you're getting nine, you know, what happens seven years from now, like you don't know it's in.

Speaker 2:          01:02:06       It's important that your health is important. So I think that. So those, you know, and there's a variety of other magazines you can also get if you're eating a lot of like a stomach lining tripe. So it's called [inaudible]. Yeah. I mean, so it's not like you can't get it, but they're not. Most of these people that are carnivore diet or just eating beef, right? Especially if the people are working a job where they go in to an office nine to five or they're traveling and it's a really hard to eat all this cool. Like, you know, the, the inuits were eating things like raw, like they were eating raw liver, Raul, like raw whale blubber and spleen spleen's a good source. I mean you can get vitamin C from spleen, I think heart. So there's some organs, vitamin C when you cook it, 25 percent of it's lost. So that's why a lot of the muscle meat and stuff, it does start out with vitamin C, but when you cook it, I mean if you're not eating it raw, then you're definitely, it's negligible.

Speaker 4:          01:03:02       One young guy who is a carnivore diet proponent that seems to be approaching this in a much more comprehensive way. He's really big on organ meats in particular, liver and many other things. And he's talking about how these organ meats, uh, will, uh, be excellent sources of a lot of the vitamins that people are concerned that you're missing from vegetables. You're, do you think that that is possible? And it means spleen, I guess for vitamin C. But like what? Uh, what about just liver or kidneys or things along those lines? Mean what, what are you going to be deficient in? If you go the organ meat route,

Speaker 2:          01:03:39       I mean I think that, you know, if you're the, the magnesium and um, uh, the magazine won't be in while you're out there. Can you give me another one who's. Thanks, I'm magnesium, but you can get. I mean it's, you can do it right. I mean you can do it, but um, it seems very difficult and I don't think most people will do it. And you recommend of course, getting all this stuff from food. If you were going to get magnesium, but it did.

Speaker 4:          01:04:08       Is it feasible that you could just supplement with multivitamins and,

Speaker 2:          01:04:13       and cover all your bases? You know what I mean? I think the same goes for Vegetarians. I think they should, you know, they do supplement and they take the 12, they take iron, which isn't necessarily. I think it's much better to take iron, get iron from food. It's not as bioavailable in a pill form. Also, the Bible belt, the pill form has been shown to disrupt other things like, whereas iron from food isn't just depends on the ratios of other things like, you know, disrupting, disrupting the transport of other transition elements and things like that. It's isolated also. Yeah, something about that. Also there's bacteria in the gut that um, that can be pathogenic and that use iron, but it seems to be only in supplemental form that that's. I'm not saying you should never supplement supplement iron throughout my, uh, third trimester, but I just think that you're going to potentially run into more problems. Um, with that, you know, iron does it. It does come from bread, meat, correct. Yeah, I mean irons very bioavailable when it's bound to hemoglobin and versus vegetarians just ate red meat.

Speaker 2:          01:05:21       You know, there's, there's, there's, I think that, that there's a whole other host of micronutrients that vegetarians are there, but that's not what we're talking about. So I think, you know, um, there's also other important reasons to eat the plants instead of doing just the organ meat and also just doing the supplements as well, you know, in some of those reasons have to do with the fact that microbiome is really important. So you're getting, you know, the fermentable types of fiber that are really important for growing all sorts of commensal bacteria in the gut. Like we don't know what's gonna happen with, you know, someone that's only just eating meat longterm, particularly with, like I said, the putrifactive bacteria and all that. I mean that's just a word future future Fi. Yeah, that's the Fed feathers. Putrifactive bacteria also that are like on corpses and stuff.

Speaker 2:          01:06:09       In fact, that's where I think the cadaveric comes from the work they produce something evergreen, right? That's what I'm thinking. It must be where it should have a huge chip and cadaveric mean. Sounds, sounds like farts. So I was like, they actually are. Yeah, they do the portrait. I think there's a response with some of the really nasty parts. Um, but you know, like that. So that's another reason. And then the other, the other important thing, or the phytochemicals, the, the, there's these polyphenols and all these things that are present in plant the humans were, we evolved eating, we evolved eating them, you know, so, so the, the, it's during, throughout human evolution, you know, humans, we're stressed on many levels. One, they went through moments of food scarcity where the fasting came in. I mean, that's important right now. We don't have that. We can get food all the time, anytime, right?

Speaker 2:          01:07:04       So, so that was an important, um, uh, stress that humans have evolved with exercise aerobic exercise, right? That's another thing. I mean, you had to, you had to move to get food and run from predators. I mean, so we, we evolved exercising. Now you can see so many people don't do that. We also evolved eating plants and meat. I mean, we're omnivores. So we have these basically all these pathways that are activated when we eat plants and from certain compounds in plants into insect Antifa, Eden's, their, their, their implants. And when humans eat them, they basically activate a variety of really, really important stress response pathways. A lot of these pathways get activated by exercise and fasting as well, so there is a lot of overlap between them, but I see a lot of people, you know, on the, on this carnivore diet, talking about how they're so bad for you and if they would take the time to actually read studies, human studies where people are given a lot of these insect antifa didn't compounds things like I said thiocyanate like Sulforaphane, I'm curcumin, resveratrol, anthocyanins, and just tons and tons of them, you know, they would see that there's beneficial effects that happen and there's a lot of mechanism for why that is, you know, so I mean the Sulforaphane is one that I like to talk about and there are, there's tons and tons of human intervention data where people are given either cruciferous vegetables or they're given Broccoli sprouts.

Speaker 2:          01:08:34       Broccoli sprouts are really great source, cruciferous vegetables, Broccoli, cabbage, fermented cabbage, Brussel sprouts, you know, all that stuff. So Broccoli sprouts have like 10, anywhere between 10 and 100 times more. A lot of that work was done by Dr Jed Fahy, friend of mine, he's at Johns Hopkins, very great scientist, as a lot of research on sulforaphane. But, um, you know, if you look at intervention trials, we were talking about air pollution, like there's an intervention trial. There's more than one showing in humans showing that if you give humans Broccoli sprout extract for seven days, they start to excrete benzene and accurately and Benzenes in air pollution. Sixty percent on day one. Like they started screening it in their urine, like you're getting rid of that. And that's largely because sulforaphane activates a variety of enzymes, one called phase two detoxification enzymes, which are important for getting rid of a potentially harmful compounds.

Speaker 2:          01:09:25       It inactivates phase one biotransformation enzymes, which are enzymes that are able to like take a pro carcinogen and turn it into a carcinogen. So, um, you know, there's intervention trials in humans that it's, you know, men that were given Broccoli sprout extract, a lowered their, their, their biomarker for prostate cancer, um, by, by like 86 percent or lower the doubling rate of about 86 percent. You know, so this is like, this is important. There's studies showing that humans given, for example, two different studies showing that humans given 300 grams of Brussel sprouts a day. One, they increase a really important antioxidant in their plasma called glutathione by like one point four fold and they decreased oxidative DNA damage in their blood cells. Dna damage like we were just talking about, they decreased it like by 30 percent or something like that. Two separate studies, Brussel sprouts and I liked, I see people like, you know, I'm talking about the carnivore diet and how sulforaphane increases DNA damage and they like referenced this in vitro study where they dumped sulforaphane on cultured cells in a dish.

Speaker 2:          01:10:31       It's like, you know, what else is going to do that shit heterocyclic amines from the cooked meat you're eating like you know, so. So if you dump something at a high enough concentration, yeah, it's going to fuck it up, you know, but we're talking about humans ingesting. If you were to exercise nonstop and not rest, it would be toxic. If you were to fast and not stop, it would be toxic. Like, you know, so, so, so, so how some of these pathways are working is that they, the dose that they're given, you know, eating, it's almost impossible to, to eat the kind of dose that it would take to cause severe damage and you know, what you would get sick, you would know, you'd be like, wait a minute. Like so. So I mean I think that using that as an excuse is really, um, first of all, they should read the studies and there's so many more studies.

Speaker 2:          01:11:15       It's been shown recently to increase gludethyon in the brain. Human intervention studies, humans that were given sulforaphane extract, increase it in their plasma and in their brain. Gludethyon was one of the major and Alex in the brain plays a major role in traumatic brain injury, brain aging. I mean this is important. Like this is a possible therapeutic intervention. It's been shown in randomized placebo controlled trials to improve autistic symptoms and adolescents open label trials. It's been shown to improve autism in children, autistic symptoms, children. I mean, there's just study after study after study and I'm just talking about the human ones and there's more, there's also lots of animal studies where they're feeding a mega doses and, and there's positive benefits. There's been studies, you know, feeding, feeding humans, large doses like something equivalent to like 70 or 100 grams of Broccoli sprouts, which have a lot more so for her fame than like Brussels sprouts do.

Speaker 2:          01:12:04       And there was no toxic side effects in the liver. Thyroid. That's one concern people do have if you have hyperthyroid. Sulforaphane can compete with iodine for transport into the thyroid. I don't think that's usually an issue. It certainly doesn't seem to be an issue in healthy people, but iodine is found in seafood. I mean their sources of iodine you can eat. So maybe someone with hyperthyroid might want to make sure they're not eating a ton. Like you're not like know Kale smoothie after kills me with the other kids. Don't be like me, you know, make sure you know, just that you're having your Brussels sprouts with your, with your elk meat or whatever. You know, I think it's a problem. Um, so you know, it, I do get a little, I see, I see. Like you mentioned Dr Sean Baker. He's like, he put out a video about like he mentioned to me, my name's talking about how I only talk about in vitro data and I'm like, dude, go watch my video or my interview with the expert at Johns Hopkins. We're talking about human studies. The in vitro data is coming from what the opposite that had the damaging effects. It's in vitro dumping. Get on the culture side.

Speaker 4:          01:13:05       Just two things going on. There's one, there's a real cursory examination of data. Were they in this confirmation bias and it's the combination of the two of those things. They find one thing that's sort of kind of vaguely supports what they wanted to support and then they run with it and they talk about it as if they're experts. Very dangerous. Yes. And this is one of the reasons why I'm so happy that you're talking about this because you can give people a real comprehensive understanding of all the different things at play. And one of the things that I get from you when I talked to you about nutrition is it's mind boggling how many different factors are going on simultaneously in the human body when it comes to nutrition absorption, when, uh, you know, in the various stages of the body and how it can vary with different people when there's so much going on. So when someone just starts talking about vegetables are toxic, like, oh, Jesus Christ,

Speaker 2:          01:14:03       read any of the study, have you just go look at the scientific data like on it to

Speaker 4:          01:14:08       be toxic? This is what's crazy. It's, this is an, that's akin to veganism. It's really, it's a, it's a, just another side of the same mindset. It's almost like a religious mindset. They hashtag. I did say it, look, I'm a fucking mediator. You can't accuse me of being anti meat, but I, I side, I eat more vegetables. I think that I eat meat. I certainly. It's certainly like right up there and I'm not giving them up. I think that's stupid. I just did. Doesn't make any sense to me. And I liked them. There's this, there's this weird push and the, you know, if you look under Hashtag meet heels, there's all these people telling these stories about all the lost all this weight and they did all this, this blah blah blah and the health benefits and Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah. But they only want it to be because of the consumption of meat only they think that it's because of the singular aspect of their diet and the fact that they've eliminated everything else, but they're not, they don't do any studying of elimination diets. They don't do any study of the prolonged benefits of fasting and all these different things that you're talking about, which I think are there. These are all factors in this really complicated thing that's going on that most likely has something to do with their gut biome and their immune system.

Speaker 2:          01:15:33       Right? Absolutely. I mean those are two major confounding factors like, so major, you know, it's um, it's important. It's just important to approach this like a science, you know, and, and not like a religion, like you said, where you want to believe something. And so you just find, you know, this, this study that I also see circulating around that why plants are really bad to eat. It's like they're there, they're there means that the insect anti nutrients or pesticides from my former mentor. Okay, Dr Bruce Ames who spent his entire career like advocating micronutrients from vegetables and from me and from fish. Okay. It's like so ironic, but if you actually read the paper, not only does it say it doesn't, you know, these, these insect antifa like sulforaphane don't cause cancer, but it also has a whole section on heterocyclic amines from cooked meat. So if you really want to use that paper as an argument why to not eat plants, then maybe read the paper and realize, oh, it's also talking about heterocyclic amines as well.

Speaker 2:          01:16:36       The point of the paper was like, I'm getting a little emotional. I like it. The point of your robot self appointed the paper was basically not to worry about like some of the amounts that you're being exposed to you with some of these natural, you know, an insect antifa edits that are found in plants. And some of the cook things and meet and as well as some of the pesticides that are found synthetic pesticides because basically that they're in such small amounts that, so that was Kinda the point of the paper was back in the nineties. Um, and, but I just think that it's a little hypocritical to use paper,

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       you know, as a, as like. And literally it's like, I mean, it's like proliferated everywhere. That's. I see this paper all the time. Say Well did you read the paper because it has a whole section on, um, on the insect antibiotics from coffee, which a lot of people drink. And also for me, what, there's that thing that people do where they do have A. I have a joke about it in my act about a register, a study that said that sperm can cure depression in women. And I slammed my laptop shut and I didn't read another word. I'm like, I've found the cure, but this is me. This is what the title. Yeah. This is essentially what these people were doing. They, they, they will read or risk oftentimes don't even read, but recite from someone else's, reciting it in a video didn't read right, which is what's going on with a lot of this stuff and this is what I'm concerned with.

Speaker 3:          01:18:06       I keep seeing all these people like, Hey, I'm going to try the carnivore die. Hey, try the carnivore diet. I tell you, it's amazing and I'm just sitting here shaking my head. I'm like, this doesn't make any sense. Like, I don't. Why would you want to eliminate a massive source of bioavailable nutrients? Like, and then when they're talking about the negative consequences of consuming vegetables, that there's different sort of toxic elements. I do remember you talking about how these stressors can actually have a positive and beneficial result when your body reacts to these stressors. Yeah, that's exactly how exercise works. That's exactly a fasting works exactly how heat stress from the sauna work. And it's how these phytochemicals. I'm calling phytochemicals just as like a generic category, but they're are these compounds that are made by plants to ward off insects. Um, and, and, uh, and we evolved eating them and they activate amazing stress response pathways in, in humans, in our brain, you know, in multiple in blood cells.

Speaker 3:          01:19:07       I mean, it's just human intervention trials showing this. So you're going gonna miss out. We evolved with, we're supposed to be stressed by exercise, by fasting during the time restricted eating like that. We're supposed to do that and we're supposed to eat some plants I think they're trying to accomplish. They're trying to simplify something that's incredibly complicated and they're doing it with this sort of religious fervor is, is, it's very strange and I can feel it when I talk about it where people get upset, they're getting upset at me, like I'm criticizing Jesus or something very weird. And again, I'm not a Vegan. I eat lots of meat. You know, you and I have had conversations about the importance of meat. Yeah. So it's, it's, it's, it's a religious thing. It really is. It's the same sort of mindset that allows people to get by just rabidly republican or anything else like fill in the blanks, whatever it is. You know,

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       there was a, there's a, it's just a thing that people do theirs for the longest. There's two different camps in Jujitsu when you're something crazy, there's g and Nogi a gooey is the Kimono, this white or you know, multicolor, you could wear it, different colors now, but it started out with why and um, a lot of people learn their Jujitsu, grabbing onto the geek, you know, like sort of a Judogi or uh, you know, Karate d and utilizing it as part of the grappling technique. And then Nogi came along and would Nogi is they use rash guards, they don't grab the clothes and they concentrate on control of the body with under hooks and over hooks and gable grips and things along those lines. And it became a religious battle between D and Nogi. And I remember sitting there watching this and it was a problem because like people would get angry.

Speaker 4:          01:20:56       What camp are you in, Bro? And I trained both. I have a black belt in, I have a black belt Nogi. I trained both of them. I think there's benefits to both of them, but there was this weird thing where you were supposed to choose sides. It's since alleviated and people realize how preposterous it is, but for a long time, like four years, the Jujitsu community was split where people were angry at people who are the gate or angry at people who were no gay. Like my friend Eddie, Eddie Bravo who teaches no gay people were angry at him for teaching a system of Jujitsu that didn't involve a certain type of clothing. It's the same mindset. People just want you to believe what they believe only and they get rabid about it. They get crazy and I'm seeing this with this carnivore diet and I think there's a psychological aspect of it to it that you were talking about when in terms of this placebo effect that I think they feel like I've never felt better.

Speaker 4:          01:21:51       I'm on this carnivore diet. I'm doing chin ups. I'm running around the block. Like when you read about everyone feeling better and I want in, I want to on this carnivore diet, and then there's also. Well, if you are doing this as opposed to the standard American diet, I think you have the same sort of response that you have when people are talking about the positive benefits of the Vegan Diet. I think if you have a Po, if you have a vegan diet in comparison to eating chips and fries and soda, yeah, you're going to feel fucking amazing and people talk about it. It's just like they did the carnival and they get and they want you to do. I mean, there's pee. I'm seeing the same patterns that I see with vegans were these carnivore people are putting meat and their screen name, you know, um, mediator Mike, you know, Carnivore Carl. There are other fucking crazy people. They're doing the same thing that vegans do with our, on the Vegan warrior. I'm carnivores Carl, you know, fuck you. Planning poisoned and they're assholes. You don't even understand what you're doing to your body. And then because I like plants, I like, you get thrown in and you can't. You have to pick a camp. I'm not picking a cab.

Speaker 4:          01:22:58       I liked my Paleo Diet and I actually, I'm probably going to try a little bit of Quito. I'm gonna. I'm gonna Experiment. They're a little bit too. So there's some great positive

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       cognitive benefits for that. I mean, I've, I've really experienced that. It's, it's hard for me because what knocks me out ironically, but knocks me out of Ketosis with the most of my diet is fairly ketogenic. Sep, I eat too much meat. Yeah, I crave it. I'm always the guy to. Well, I need, I think I need a lot. I don't know, maybe I'm just full of Shit. But uh, I also have a lot because I, you know, I hunt elk and shoot a 400 pound animal and good quality meat. It's the best. Yeah. And I'll eat a fucking pound of it. So I'm eating like, who knows how many grams of protein that is. It's something insane, but I mean, I don't think it's a placebo effect because I've been doing this for years now. I feel pretty fucking good, you know. And um, we're doing this fitness challenge now.

Speaker 1:          01:23:50       That's what this thing is. Me and my friend, Bert Kreischer, my friend Tom Seger in Arusha fear, we for the month, we have to see who burns the most calories and gets the most maps. This is my zone thing and I'm planning on killing those guys. I'm planning. I'm literally having them try to die. Keep up with me. Sober October. Yeah, October. It's going on right now. Is there. Is there a hot yoga and sauna involved? So I'm doing it. Those pussies are just going to try to like go run around the block, but I'm doing the 15 hot yogas plus I'm doing all sorts of the crate to one our hardcore cardio sessions yesterday and then today I'm going to do kickboxing for an hour and a half tomorrow. I'm going to do an hour and a half of yoga in the morning. Then I'm going to run at night too. You definitely should eat more meat more.

Speaker 1:          01:24:38       I'm I'm planning. I want these guys to break. That's awesome. Break them. Burt burt's getting cockies posting stuff on instagram today. I talked to burt about some song. He was real into the sauna. He's asking, he's really into vodka and cheeseburgers that actually caused you to excrete micronutrients, zinc and magnesium haven't. Yeah, the, the, you know what else it causes you to excrete jokes. That's part of the problem. You Scott Damn hilarious when he's drunk. It's a part of the problem. Know again, balance. I think this is a very important conversation to have because I think there's a lot of people that are enticed by the magic of this carnivore diet and I think uh, I'm so happy that you or the one that can cause you can do it in such a scientific manner and just sort of illuminated all the various problems and sort of explain why they are experiencing these benefits because even brilliant man like Jordan Peterson, he's a brilliant guy. He is just accepting the positive benefits of this and I don't know how far he's looked into this.

Speaker 2:          01:25:41       Yeah, I, you know, and also it's important like the, the, the, the fact that the no cbu thing experiencing bad things, you know, also things when you change your microbiome and you're going along period of time or just eating meat. I mean it, vegans that like eat me or people that are on a low fat diet that eat fat, they experienced negative effects. I mean because they're there, our microbiome changes that do occur and lead to discomfort and those things will eventually go away. But that was also something to consider like so there may be a no seatbelt on top of actual things that are short term and that it's not just people that eat meat and then all of a sudden need some plans. So like I knew it, you know, there, there are changes that have takes some time, a little bit of time in the microbiome that may be happening because you know, definitely begins talking about the same thing.

Speaker 2:          01:26:26       People on a low fat that you eat a high fat diet, say the same thing. I mean, so you know, some, someone's got to be right. Well maybe everyone's right. You know, maybe there's a mechanism, the microbiome changes and everyone's right. Your body adjusts dependent upon your diet. What? Yeah, and that's, it's been shown. I mean, the microbiome does change depending on your diet. And you know, if you're, if you're eating a low fat and then going to a high fat diet in that there's, you're, you're, you're making bile acids and things like that. And you know, if you don't have a microbiome that are resistant to that, you can start to have microbiome being killed off and then it can cause inflammation. You know, the going from the plant. I mean, you're, you're basically selecting for, if you're eating a bunch of protein, you've got a lot of putrifactive bacteria, maybe less of the other, you know, maybe it takes some time to be able to like ferment some of those complex carbohydrate fermentable fibers and stuff.

Speaker 2:          01:27:12       So I think that there's the mechanism, I mean, it's not even easy to figure out mechanism, but there's usually a mechanism and an explanation for these four things. And you know, sometimes you have a hypothesis and sometimes it's writing, sometimes it's not. It doesn't mean what you're experiencing isn't real, just means that you don't, you didn't understand why you're experiencing, you thought you did, but you didn't Makilah Peterson. So that when she first got on the carnivores, she had diarrhea for six solid weeks. Wow. That would, uh, push through it. That would, no pun intended. Shake me loose. Wow. It'd be like, yeah, after about two weeks ago, like I'm kinda tired of shit in my pants this six months. A lot. Yeah. For her it was worth it in comparison to the, the, the, the negative effects that she was having on her immune system.

Speaker 2:          01:28:03       I mean, yeah, you might want to talk to her about the fasting. I mean, trying that. If she's open minded, you know, at the end of the day it's hard when someone's experiencing it is, it is hard and it is hard when they, that's just, you know, I, I get that. But it also is important to realize that this is, there hasn't been proved that she's experiencing what she's experiencing because she's caught all plans out and you know, so at the end of the day there is no data. So you can't say definitively, but I mean there's a lot of data on, you know, why you should include some plants at least. And again, if you're doing this for an autoimmune, there's a lot of really good data that fasting helps, like, and not only helps, it helps you age, like I'm going to start doing just like, you know, some, some fast, like couple times a year once I've completely weaned my son how many days so, so a prolonged fast take, but I'm technically in humans according to Dr Valter Longo, he, um, he thinks that it has to be more than 48 hours, so you can do like a 72 hour fast and my inlaws have been doing, they've done like a couple of three, three and a half day fast and they're getting all sorts of massive improvements in a variety of biomarkers, a Lipid and glucose and inflammation.

Speaker 2:          01:29:17       You know, a lot of things that I know carnivore people are talking about as well, but could be getting the same thing with fasting. Um, you're doing this. Are you limiting the amount of exercise you do? Some people do. It depends on how you feel. I mean, you know, you certainly, I think that if you're doing, if you're not eating any food and you're just doing like a water fast, um, you certainly could be more dangerous and should listen to your body and if you feel really sick or your heart's racing, I think they just need to eat. You mean something that like I wouldn't just willy nilly doing as opposed to what other kinds of things. The fact there's a fasting mimicking diet where people can. This is something valter Longo has published on in humans and study humans as well as animal data where it's like a very, you know, like the first day it's like a thousand calories and the second through fifth day it's like 700 calories and then they're broken up where it's like the first day it's like, it's very much a low sugar, low protein, high fat, modest carb kind of diet.

Speaker 2:          01:30:13       So what are the pros of that you consume? Like nuts and not. Yeah, he, well he's got like a package kind of thing that people like can be prescribed, like a physician can prescribe it to a patient, you know. But um, um, you can, you can sort of make your own as well with whole foods, you know, like, oh, like an avocado some. Yeah. But you have to sort of keep the calorie cap so make sure you're not getting too many calories. That's kind of important as well. And you do that for five days. What is the standard avocado oil avocado contains terms of calorie? No, no, no. Um, so, but yeah, you can do like, like you could definitely do like an avocado if it's like the whole day. And then some people have sort of done modified versions of it as well, like where it's a little more key to genic the, they've adjusted the carbohydrate and fat to be a little more of the ketogenic.

Speaker 2:          01:30:59       And like I said, I'm the study that was published in parallel with a fasting mimicking diet study, the fasting mimicking diet they did for three months, but it was only one week that did the fasting mimicking diet. So that the other part or the three months they were eating a Mediterranean diet, the other people in which was in Germany, um, they were on a ketogenic diet and they were on it for three months and they experienced improvements as well. So there's definitely ways to tweak it. And actually the out getting to the Alzheimer's. Um, the, the, the, the guy that I interviewed, Dr Dale Bredesen, um, he, he is published extensively and also as clinical, a lot of clinical experience where he's, he's trying to understand the mechanism of Alzheimer's disease and I'm getting to this for the Ketogenic is going to come back eventually. But so he, he tries to understand a lot of the underlying mechanisms for Alzheimer's disease.

Speaker 2:          01:31:54       And in his clinical experience he sort of sees there's subtypes of where you can get like patients that have a really high inflammatory where they've got lots of inflammatory biomarkers. Um, they also have high fasting blood glucose in there. Little like, you know, a high fasting insulin, but then you can get the same sort of metabolic effect where you have people that are kind of on the insulin resistant Spectra, but without inflammation there's that subtype. And then there's like another subtype where it's like, it seems like a big environmental component like toxic stuff people are being exposed to and that leads to a much, much earlier diagnosis and Alzheimer and sort of different phenotype. But um, he has this really aggressive and very thorough protocol that's like on the individual level where people, you know, he has tons and tons of biomarkers that are measured.

Speaker 2:          01:32:45       One is the fasting blood glucose, so she'd be less than five point five actually gets Hba, one C, which is a three month mark or a fasting blood glucose should be less than five point five. Fasting insulin should be less than seven. Um, he's got your high sensitivity. C reactive protein should be less than point eight. And then he has a variety of other inflammatory biomarkers that are also measured. Um, and a variety of other things. He looks at a lot of different micronutrients. He looks at a homocysteine, homocysteine is really important because, um, there's publications showing that if you lower homocysteine it cannot enact. He actually published this in one patient. It reversed the hippocampal atrophy, which is kind of amazing. So there, you know, it's not really knowing exactly what the mechanism is, but, so that's something he looks at and he does this diet.

Speaker 2:          01:33:27       I'm this like diet, this whole lifestyle change. I mean people improving sleep exercise and he gives them all sorts of vitamins and fish oil. But on top of that, he's this diet that he is Kinda like to lower the inflammation and improve the insulin sensitivity and blood glucose and all that where he puts them on a diet that's kind of like, he calls it Quito flags, but it's Kinda like a, a key to genic diet, modified ketogenic diet. But a lot of the fats are coming from like plants versus. So like avocado, nuts, olive oil, he treats me as a condiment. Um, but, um, and, and basically is getting improvements like with, with this type of diet, lowering inflammation, proving all sorts of metabolic things. Um, so it's really, it's really interesting, I've, I've read a lot of his studies because he, he publishes a lot on Alzheimer's disease and mechanisms, you know, and he's, he's got a book out as well where he'd kind of goes in depth about it.

Speaker 2:          01:34:19       Um, so it, it, it certainly seems very interesting that he's, he's actually been able to, to, to not only like delay Alzheimer's disease, but reverse it. And this is Paul. He has published a couple of published studies where people were able to go back to work and actually, um, in some of the, in some cases their brain atrophy, a kind of stopped and it started to reverse where they were like growing more neurons. Wow. Yeah. So, and I talked to him about this and so the publication was like the original one I had read, which got me interested in his work in the first place. When I saw that, I was like, holy crap, this is amazing. It was only on 10 patients. It was kind of low. He says, now he's got like 50 more that there. He's getting ready to publish and then he's got this whole protocol where there's like just, he's got like thousands of, of, of patients where they're like kind of treating this sort of individual way.

Speaker 2:          01:35:06       They do genetic testing, blood testing and all that stuff as well. So, um, it's very interesting because it's, you know, he's, he's basically showing the important interaction between diet, lifestyle and potentially genetics. And this is kind of where my paper comes in because, um, there is a, there is a gene that increases the risk for Alzheimer's if you have one copy of it. So you get two copies of every gene from one from mom, one from dad, if you have one copy of it or increases your risk for Alzheimer's disease by like two to three fold, you have two copies. It can be anywhere between 10 and 15 fold. So it's like, really, it's called April before it also increases the, the, your chances of having a really poor outcome if you have any type of Tbi, um, and people with that that, um, uh, Lele and have Tbi, multiple tbis definitely are much more likely to come down with some sort of disease.

Speaker 2:          01:35:59       So, um, but not everyone with it gets it. So there's like this, like what's going on here, you know, there's, there seems to be this clear, you know, gene environment interaction going on. And so, um, I, I, uh, was really interested in this because I found out I had one of these illegals and of course that got me really concerned. I'm, one of the things that's really, really important is sleep because sleep is one of the ways you actually clear away amyloid plaques from your brain. Your brain actually swells during sleep. Um, you, you squirt cerebral spinal fluid into your brain and you basically clean out amyloid plaques and a bunch of other gunk that's built up carwash for your brain when you sleep. Yeah. And, um, I talked about this with a former guest here is Dr Matt Walker. We talked about it a lot. He's like him and I were to, it was awesome.

Speaker 2:          01:36:44       I, I just, I could have talked to who's a mindblower oh yeah. I love, I love it. Um, I really loved the conversation I had with him so we talked about this in detail because I'm basically, that is one of the major ways you clear amyloid plaques, but the other way is through an Api we mediated mechanism and April we for um, does it like 20 fold less efficiently than someone that doesn't have it. And so they rely on sleep and there's all sorts of studies with April before showing sleep is a major modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer's disease if you have a boy before, but you're getting good quality sleep, you have like the same risk as someone that doesn't have it. And so I was like, Gee, you know, of course I was thinking about this the entire time that had my son and I was like not sleeping from us.

Speaker 2:          01:37:29       But anyways. Um, the other thing that I looked into in my publication, and this is where, um, the, another sort of diet gene interaction comes in, is that there's all sorts of clinical studies showing that people with Apl, we for benefit from fish eating fish where they can basically have improved pathology in their brain, have improved symptoms of dementia, um, but when they take fish oil, if you take fish oil and give it to two people with dementia, only the people without April, we for benefit for some reason the April before people aren't benefiting. And if you look into the literature, animals that were given human apl, we for versus Human April way three, the Dha doesn't get transported across the blood brain barrier very well with, uh, April before. So it's like, what's going on? There's some sort of transport defect and Dha in the brain is really important.

Speaker 2:          01:38:19       It's been shown to play an important role in human studies, but a lot of animal studies and human studies that have been shown to, to increase amyloid clearance. Uh, it's in humans. It's been shown to decrease the Tau Tangles. And also, it's really important for, um, glucose uptake into the brain because it regulates the transporters, glucose transporters. What was the second thing? Tau. Tau Tangles. So Tau Tangles form inside of neurons and they disrupt, um, a process that's called microtubule transport, which is where basically it's, it's the, it's the neuron system for transporting fatty acids, um, all sorts of goodies energy to the, uh, to the synapse or synaptic transitions happening. And Tau tangles basically disrupt that whole thing. Amyloid plaques form outside of neurons and the extracellular space and they can disrupt synapse formation, they're thought to form as a protective mechanism against viral, fungal or bacterial infection.

Speaker 2:          01:39:17       So it's Kinda like, um, you know, that that's the reason why they're forming, but it's just a matter of clearing them out and also how your, how your brain is able to like deal with amyloid plaque burden and April we is not able to deal with it very well. Uh, so the Dha transport thing is basically what I, what I published is, is, has to do with the interaction between different forms of Dha and EPA. We, um, there's two different ways that Dha is transported across the brain. One is when it's like in a free fatty acid form, it's bound to albumin and it requires an intact blood brain barrier, uh, specifically the outer membrane of the blood brain barrier needs to be intact. And, um, and because it goes through passive diffusion, well, if there's a disruption in the blood brain barrier, then the Gha isn't going to be transporting very well in that form.

Speaker 2:          01:40:03       Um, and it's been shown that April before actually disrupts that very thing, the outer membrane of the tight junctions that bind the outer membrane of the endothelial cells that line, the blood brain barrier. And so, um, it's, it's quite possible that that is why Dha is not getting into the brains very well in April. We, for carriers, there's another way to get it in and this is through a transporter that, that uses something called Lysophosphatidylcholine Dha, which is a fossil liquid form of Dha forms from phosphatidylcholine, Dha, the transporters called Mfs Dta. And it basically takes the Dha and flips it down, uh, across the outer membrane, into the inner membrane of the blood brain barrier, so it bypasses that outer membrane and then it gets transported in. So, um, if you look at animal studies that you delete that transporter, like 60 percent of the Dha, Dha is, you know, not getting into the brain if you give, give animals, Dha humans with, um, with, uh, a variation in that gene that makes it less, less active, have get neurodegenerative, a form of neurological disorders and neurodegenerative disorders.

Speaker 2:          01:41:09       So it's obviously very important, um, you know, to, to, to get Dha into the brain through that mechanism. Well, it turns out if you consume Dha in phospholipid form, you actually form more of Lysophosphatidylcholine Dha. And that's because basically where the djs are on a, on a Phospho, Libya, they're in multiple carbons and one of them can escape a lipase in the pancreas. And so basically you can form more of it. Okay. But um, so for fossil liquid form djs and fish, but it's really abundant in fish roe, like super abundant, like 30 slash 70 percent of Dha that's found in fish roe, which are fish eggs, a variety of different kinds, um, are impossible liquid form and you consume that stuff. You, that's the reason why I want to get to talk about it. Um, I order my. So you can like, I get Salmon Roe, I like the salmon because it also has asked us anthon in it, which is you order it.

Speaker 2:          01:42:06       Like is it bottled or canned or frozen? Frozen. It's frozen. I order it. But you can go into like a Japanese store, you can get flying fish roe, which are much. Some people prefer those because they're smaller and the texture, they don't like the Salmon Roe, like the occur. If you go to a Sushi restaurant and you get like the, like the shakes that come in like the seaweed or have a bigger, bigger, they're bigger and they kind of know how to use those for Bait. Yeah. Some people don't like them because it's like squish it and it's like liquid coming. Great for catching rainbow trout, rainbow trout, rainbow trout, eat salmon, eggs. So I'm, so I'm basically, you know, that's, that's one way to get more phospholipid form, but also Dha consumed in like triglyceride form, which is what a lot of fish oil is also forms.

Speaker 2:          01:42:52       It also forms Dha Lysophosphatidylcholine, but you just need more of it. So it's also possible that some of these clinical trials showing that, you know, fish oil failed was because they were using like the dose they were using was two grams. So maybe you need six rams. Maybe you need for. Is there any negative benefits or the negative consequences of consuming too much fish oil? Well, I think, you know, certainly depends on the type of fish oil that you're consuming. You're consuming oxidized fish oils and certainly not very good, but why would it be oxidized if it's last, if it's too old, it's too old and depending on how they ice, how, what the isolation process was, but yeah, too old for sure. Things that are sitting around a purification process is very important. The purification. Yes. Yes. Very important. And like I said, there's that fish oil standards program you can look up and there's a variety of different fish oil supplement brands that are on there.

Speaker 2:          01:43:44       The other thing is like they was just recently a randomized, very, very large randomized controlled trial published on four grams of one of the omega three fatty acids found in fish and other marine organisms, EPA and they were given four grams a day for five years. 8,000 patients, randomized, placebo controlled different countries and it reduced. And these actually were patients that had hypertrophic high triglycerides. And also we're on Stanton's, it lowered cardiovascular disease risk by like 28 or 30 percent or something like that, you know. So that was a high dose and that was five years long. Pretty pretty long followup. And it was a randomized placebo controlled study. Um, I think it was called the vitals, it bitlead study. Um, but you know, the other thing that I think people are worried about with really high dose fish oil is um, the potential for blood thinning because it does inhibit thromboxanes and prostoglandins and leukotrienes, leukotrienes and things that are important for like, you know, clotting.

Speaker 2:          01:44:48       Um, you know, I've been taking a really high dose for like over a decade, you know, official I've been taking not always six grams, but I've been taking a high dose for quite a while. How often do you get your blood work done? Well recently I haven't been getting it done very often because I'm the pregnancy and breastfeeding and Cicero changes things. I try to do it like it ideally like doing it once a quarter, but like a couple times a year for sure. I'm probably troy six months. That's, that's good. I think. I think like, you know, sometimes you can get super obsessive by doing, if you're doing it like once a quarter, you know, for people that are not healthy, I think doing it once a quarter until they start to get healthier. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:45:29       Got It all dialed in to supplement with Niacin at all.

Speaker 2:          01:45:33       No, I don't supplement with nice and um, but I'm thinking about doing the nicotinamide riboside, you know, Nice. And Ken that's been shown to like lower ldl and they get hired at the stuff that causes the flushing. Right. The stuff that causes a flushing, but also I think that there were some problems with it, like disrupting insulin, something with insulin secretion. I don't recall. It's been like so many years since I've read those studies. But um, the nicotine nicotinamide riboside beside forms Nad so Niacin is a precursor for, for Nad, which is I'm also increased during fasting.

Speaker 1:          01:46:08       We were going to get an, a d, a ivy injections. We still got to do that. Jeremy, that company contacted us. They, there's two ways of doing it. One, it takes eight hours or two, it takes like 10 to 15 minutes and it's excruciating pain. It's excruciating. Yeah, they push it. Yeah. They push it through and it's just your guts feel like they're on fire for like 10 minutes. I want to try that just to see how bad it is because I want to stay a long time. Yeah. I don't have eight hours. That's not happening. I'm not sitting around for eight hours, but apparently there's some significant benefits to ivy versions of it and doing it. A Ben Greenfield was on the podcast talking about it pretty much a pretty in depth. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:46:50       He's a big believer of it. Yeah. I couldn't find. I actually tried finding some published studies on the Ivy version. I really couldn't find any. I take the time to. I'm pretty sure it was recommended that you recommended it to me. Yeah, I subscribed to that. I get that stuff every day. So that's um, and there have been published studies, clinical studies in humans on that, but I take that stuff every day. I like it. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:47:11       But, uh, I guess, I don't know a lot of things I don't really know. But um, the NAD by intravenous method, it's supposed to be a much more potent form of it. And the people that I know that have tried it, like the guys at on it, they get a, someone will come down to there, the onnit labs like a couple times a month and a bunch of the employees will sign up and get zapped.

Speaker 2:          01:47:32       So I wonder why some of these guys don't start gathering data and start publishing because it'd be nice to. Yeah. To would be to see some data on that. Yeah. I wonder why, you know, a lot of times it's hard to get funding for some of these things. [inaudible], you know, who knows. I mean it'd be interesting to see if it has some of the similar benefits at taking something like nicotinamide riboside has where if you take like a high enough dose you can, you can raise your, your nad levels like dramatically. Why, how many of those at least tablets are you taking on a daily basis? I stopped taking them just right now while I'm breastfeeding, breastfeeding. I'm just always on the cautious side. Um, I was taking, I think I was taking 250 milligrams. I think

Speaker 1:          01:48:13       each pill is. No, I don't. I don't remember, you know, uh, before I forgot, I did want to ask you about it, but when we butt dialing, but circling back to this whole carnival thing, one of the suggestions was that it isn't, is it possible that people, that some small percentage of the population would actually be allergic to a lot of plants?

Speaker 2:          01:48:39       I mean, there are people that can be allergic to certain component. I mean there's, there's the whole night shade family I think some people can, like they have allergic reactions to and I think that people with nightshades, tomatoes, tomatoes, peppers, egg plant. Yeah. Yeah. Um, and then I also people with gut issues. Have you ever heard of anyone

Speaker 1:          01:49:00       being allergic? Oh, so gut issues would predispose you to being

Speaker 2:          01:49:04       well because you know, there are other things in the plants that can pop, you know, so things people like to talk about, like lectins for example, and you know, lectins there they are, they are in a lot of plants but they're much more concentrated. Something like a legume, like a bean and, and they're inactivated with heat. But typically most people don't have reactions to, to, to lectins and possibly if they already have some sort of gut barrier or problem that could sort of elicit a reaction. But, um, a lot of the data out there as in vitro where lectins are used to stimulate the immune system in vitro. In fact, I've used lectins before to do an experiment, but, you know, um, so I think that yeah, there's, there's certainly food allergies are, are definitely a possibility and they do exist.

Speaker 4:          01:49:51       So is it possible that someone would be allergic to both cruciferous vegetables and, you know, a bunch of other like salary or cucumbers or things along those lines?

Speaker 2:          01:50:02       I don't know if they're allergic to them. Maybe. I think that people can have, um, you know, with like a variety of different issues like small intestinal bacterial overgrowth in their intestines. Um, you know, people that are, that are sensitive to fodmaps, those things. So it's a fodmap for, I don't have toast oligosaccharide like, I can't remember what. But the basically people, people can be sensitive to them. They're usually people with gut issues, like boils down to gut issues. And Gut issues and I, and that there certainly is some cruciferous vegetables like cabbage or something can affect people. They can feel bloated and stuff like that. Yeah, absolutely. But I do think that sometimes resolving those gut issues will resolve that problem. Um, I don't, I don't tend to think everyone's like someone's going to be allergic to every plant. I don't know though. I mean, you know, anything's possible, right? There's no literature, there's no, there's no come across any, but I haven't done an in depth search for that specific thing.

Speaker 4:          01:51:06       So is it fair to say that when people are describing this and they're saying that it might be possible that there are a small percentage of the population, are there is a small percentage of the population that's allergic to plants, that really what you're dealing with as a small percentage of population that has a significantly impaired gut biome that is finding benefit to eliminating these plants, this strict elimination diet being on this carnivore diet which also has calorie restrictive aspects to it, and even fasting restricted restricted aspects to it that this is why they're experiencing this positive benefit. And that perhaps one of the ways they could fix their gut biome would be some sort of prolonged fast or something along those lines to try to fix the problem at the root source instead of maybe what the carnivore diet would be as like some sort of a, um, a dietary bandaid.

Speaker 2:          01:52:00       Right. And I think that the study I was talking about the 15 day intermittent fast for were people with autoimmune disease. We're fasted for 24 hours every other day. They had changes in their microbiome that we're in line of very interesting changes. They actually grew bacteria that are, uh, you know, very, uh, important for producing things like butyrate, which makes, you know, helps make t regulatory cells at the signaling molecule that helps your immune system produce more t regulatory immune cells. It also something that comes from a state of Ketosis as well. Um, well this. Yeah, exactly. They were fasting. Yeah. And the thing that was so interesting and it's a question I had had for so long, it's like what happens the microbiome when you don't eat, like is it to start, you know, are you getting like a selection for mucin degrading bacteria which are degrading a certain glycoproteins that lines the gut.

Speaker 2:          01:52:53       And you know, and the thing that was so interesting about this study was that they did this like metogenomic analysis and they found from fecal samples that P, that the gene in the, within the existing microbiome, it was increasing the production of ketone bodies themselves. And that was fueling because your, your gut cells, your gut cells, and also a lot of the beneficial bacteria, like things like butyrate, lactate, appropriate Acetate, no, these are some of the short chain fatty acids. Buda rates like the big one of the gut for the gut, like gut cells, like, like an 80 or 90 percent are like using butyrate. But fasting was increasing all these ketone bodies. So it's kind of really interesting because for one, it, it, it helped and it, and it basically, um, uh, increased the diversity of this beneficial bacteria. It was very interesting. I wouldn't have guessed that. Have there been asking,

Speaker 1:          01:53:43       have there been any studies on consumption of exoticness ketones to benefit the gut biome?

Speaker 2:          01:53:49       Not that I'm aware of. I mean, do you think that that would mirror it in any way? That's a very interesting question because most of the exogenous would be like a Beta hydroxybutyrate ester. I don't. The, the question would be how similar is Beta hydroxy butyrate. Butyrate, right? Because Peter rates what, what we're talking about. That's a very interesting question. I don't know. Yeah, I mean that would be. Or even what, what's happening during, um, during like a ketogenic diet as well, right. You're making, you have a lot of circulating Beta hydroxy butyrate, is that, does that get to the gut and is there, you know. So that's, that's another interesting question.

Speaker 1:          01:54:30       Yeah. Because it is an interesting way to hack your system is that these exemptions, ketones like a key gen x or that's one that I use for a few other companies that make these. They do put your body in a state of Ketosis.

Speaker 2:          01:54:41       Yeah. No, I've definitely tried. I've tried one, um, from, from hpm n the Beta hydroxybutyrate Ester and um, I, I, it definitely like gives me energy. Um, but the other thing I really liked was the mental effects, the thing, the thing about it. So a couple, there's a sort of, it's sort of a double edge sword because I feel less anxious when I take it. And this was, this is getting me up until like, you know, four point five millimolar, Beta hydroxybutyrate in like an hour [inaudible] I, um, I feel less anxious and more full, more in the present. Like I'm more present and not like, you know, a million things ahead. Whereas like sometimes my brain goes right. So I felt like, and, and, and this is something that like, like Dan observed with me, you know, because I felt this more than once I started using it.

Speaker 2:          01:55:33       I started using, I didn't use it today but the reason why I didn't use it today, so I started using it for podcast or being talks or anything like. And the reason I didn't use it today is because the flip side is it dramatically because I'm not in Ketosis, I'm not on a ketogenic diet, it lowers my blood sugar levels, like really dramatically and this has been published, you know, there's like mechanisms that are trying to be explored to understanding why that is and possibly as a therapeutic treatment for type two diabetes and things like that. But so if, once the, once the ketones were off, which they do after a couple of hours, I'd crash because my blood glucose is low and I don't have the ketones there to compensate. Right. Whereas if I was already in Ketosis then, you know, it wouldn't matter because I'd already had been in Ketosis. You know what I'm saying? I see. Yeah. So, so, um, yeah, it's really interesting. The effects on the brain. I don't, you know, it's something that I noticed and I certainly, I'm like repeatedly noticed, you know,

Speaker 1:          01:56:35       what would be the mechanism that would allow you to be more present? That's, that seems so strange that that would have less anxiety. I mean, what would, what would cause that?

Speaker 2:          01:56:43       I don't know, I mean there's, you know, possibly the glucose is being spared in my brain for other things. That's, you know, because now the Ketone, the Beta hydroxy is being used as a source of energy and glucose is being used. I mean liquid sparing does occur, um, a lot of times in the context of making more glutathione because that's glucose's can be used for energy or it can be used to make glutathione and the pathway that does that is through a pathway called the pentose phosphate shunt and that pathway takes glucose and make something called any dph, which is then used, which isn't necessary to make glutathione. So I don't know, maybe there's some kind of, some. Because you know, what else does it for me so far? Fain sulforaphane gives me major anti anxiety effects and like cognitive, like I feel Broccoli sprouts, consumers, which does affect Gludethyon in the brain. Oh, I never thought about them anyways. It's all hypothetical.

Speaker 1:          01:57:37       What about I'm consuming those exogenous ketones with glutathione? Have you ever tried that? I didn't know those existed. I mean trying. Oh, you mean with the Broccoli sprouts, Broccoli sprouts. You mean? Yeah, well you're saying glutosiome increases glutathione in the brain, but what about a glutosiome supplemental

Speaker 2:          01:57:52       gludethyon supplements? Glutathione, first of all, it gets destroyed in the gut, but like even if your were to get it into your, your bloodstream, there's no transporter for glue to found to get into cells. So you want to make, I mean, you can get the precursors to make it and you can increase the way Broccoli sprouts does. It is increases enzymes that make it so you're making more. And so that's how you do it.

Speaker 1:          01:58:15       So when you see, so one of the things that glutathione does is it helps your body processes alcohol, correct?

Speaker 2:          01:58:25       Um, I don't, I mean, it's a power plant. Oxidant

Speaker 1:          01:58:29       wasn't that what Mark Gordon talked about? Lipos. Somo. Gludethyon, yes. Yeah. Lyposomal glutathione thigh on helps your body with the,

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       the processing of alcohol. It's a very, very strong um, and toxin antioxidant. And so, I mean, but it gets destroyed in your gut. So if you're taking it. Yeah. Yeah. And also go to thumb doesn't, it doesn't get into yourself. There's a video about it from, from this podcast. Oh No, there you go. Um,

Speaker 4:          01:59:05       yeah, that was something about the processing of alcohol now. So if, how would it. So the best way to get it would be through sulforaphane from Broccoli sprouts, cruciferous vegetables, and then your body would produce more.

Speaker 2:          01:59:19       Well. So from the, the, the human studies that I've referenced, one was 300 grams of Brussels sprouts a day, increased it, go to gludethyon on plasma by Fort One, point four fold. The other study. I'm more recently that showed an increase in plasma as well as in the brain. That was a sulfur, that was a broccoli sprout extract that was given. I don't have the dose on My instagram, I think, I don't remember. I'm talking about the dose, but um, so that's one of the ways I know of, uh, one of the most powerful ways I know of to increase glutathione and you know, basically in humans. So I don't know how much 300 grams of Brussel sprouts is.

Speaker 4:          01:59:59       So what would be a good idea? I mean, pressure from wrong would be a large dose of Electra, large plate of Brussels sprouts with a or Broccoli sprouts with some sort of a ketone supplement

Speaker 2:          02:00:15       or if you're doing a pure in Ketosis, whether that's fasting time restricted eating. So that's something that I do. So I am definitely trying to get my ketosis in or you're on a ketogenic diet and you're getting. So the question is, um, I'm not sure the glucose sparing stuff that's been shown in animal, so I don't know how much of that is translatable to humans. What effect, I mean, you always have to have evidence to say something definitively, but um, animal studies do show that there is a glucose sparing effect when you have ketone bodies. Um, so, you know, just fascinating. It was fascinating. That will make you more present. You know, they're, what's fascinating is that sulforaphane treats autistic symptoms, right? I mean, right. So, yeah. Right, right. So what's going on there is definitely. And there's also been an open label study, so there has been two trials with two or maybe three and Dr Jed Fahy, he's been a part of this as well as his colleagues, a randomized placebo controlled and open label, which is always less open label means there wasn't a placebo control, but they didn't measure metabolites of sulfur, sulfur of pain and also oxidative stress in, in plasma, which always helps.

Speaker 2:          02:01:28       Um, and then there's been a trial and schizophrenia patients, so for a grant helps with that as well. That was open label. Right now there's an ongoing placebo controlled trial that's now taking place. So there's very interesting

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       effects on the brain, you know, it seems as though there is some oxidative stress component, you know, I have a, we for who knows how much, you know, their oxidative stress may be happening more in my brain because of we for um, there's certainly increased risk for Alzheimer's disease, increase, you know, the traumatic brain injury, poor outcome, all, there's all this evidence that sort of shows that don't start boxing. Definitely not kickboxing. So do you think that mean it seems like a perfect pre podcast meal would be these Broccoli sprouts? Yeah, maybe an exhaustion as ketone drink as well, like the two of them together. Yes. So, so the only thing is like I mentioned for me, I crash after a couple of hours where I'm like, like it's like really like, like crashing. I think you could mitigate that with maybe some sort of a glucose because one of the things maybe so yeah, they say to take when you're taking those ketone salts or ketone esters are really potent ones, is to take them with glucose and they actually say on, they say in the instructions to take it with a high carbohydrate meal.

Speaker 3:          02:02:46       And so I usually will take, I'll usually eat a bowl of oatmeal with some fruit and um, and I'll take it. But, but still it really like it lowers my blood, my blood glucose levels dramatically within an hour. It's like that's interesting. I'm serious when I've taken those supplements, I don't, I don't feel the crash. Try Try that when I'm talking to him. Man, it's a really powerful HP. HIV and HIV and M, I should've brought you some. I have some in the hotel thinking about trying and taking it, but I was like, I don't. Does it taste like ass? Yeah, it tastes really bad. I mean like definitely say, you know, so bad. Some of them are so disgusting. I did an interview with the president of the Buck Institute for Research on aging and I, I like downed it right before he walked in and I was like.

Speaker 3:          02:03:38       And he had just published a study on, on ketosis and animals and helping with lifespan and brain aging and stuff. But. So I had to tell him, I'm like, like here, I just took this and I actually gave him some as well. But um, because it was kind of embarrassing. Oh yeah. I was grimacing big time. It was like a funny way to first meet someone. I know I had just eaten some pineapple because they had like some fruit available and they didn't have any carbohydrate. What am I going to. So anyways, now you know all my secrets. Well that's a good one. That's fascinating. I've never thought about that. But that seems like a pre podcast meal or pre comedy show meal. That might be like a really good idea to try just a big plate of Broccoli sprouts, Broccoli sprouts with a really good source on the supplements are not.

Speaker 3:          02:04:24       So it's really sulforaphane. It's not very stable. So you can check it into a shake. Do you grind it up? So I haven't been doing that. Yes, I grind it up. But you can just put them on a salad or you can just, you know, you don't have to do it. It doesn't taste good. Right. So like that's why you made a mistake. Um, so, so if you're going to put an n shake with other other things, you want to blend it up first because I'm the enzyme myrosinase that has to come in contact with the precursor of sulforaphane. Glucoraphanin has to be in contact with it. So it's diluted out if you have like a big all this other stuff. So blended up first and then add your other stuff. But um, I've been taking a supplement I got from, from France called prostitution, which is, there's published studies on it and it tastes like Broccoli sprouts.

Speaker 3:          02:05:08       Um, and uh, I've been taking that right now just because of the potential risk for contamination. I'm just breastfeeding and you know, I'm just like, I'm always going to. So I'm just Kinda [inaudible] that bacteria has been shown to be transferred from breast milk and juice. There was like that, that news story where the woman ate the placenta and like it was like I was reading this instagram who's a Vegan and he was going on and on about people getting ECO law for meat. I'm like, Jesus Christ, man, you get it from fucking spinach, Broccoli. You get it from farm raised vegetables like stop. Right. But, but it comes, he's writing in a way because it comes from the runoff from a animal feces. Right. And that's how it gets into. Isn't that the case? I don't know. I'm pretty sure. I'm pretty sure that's how it gets into the food out, if that's true.

Speaker 3:          02:05:58       I'm eco lie in vegetables comes from animal agriculture. Google that, I think that's true. I've certainly had some, a bad sprouts before store bought. I was sailing. You got sick, I got sick, you know, and also I'm from, once we made it home, you know, it just, if you have to be really careful if you have too much water around, if it's too much heat and condensation and all that stuff to it grows because you're eating it raw. Yeah, exactly. So when you clean it, I mean how difficult is it to clean? Did you find anything from manure? Yeah. Cool. Yeah. So it is right? Romance and general catalyst in particular. Both beef and dairy. Yep. Right. So a lot of these, especially like a real organic farm, a lot of times they're, they're very, they have animals, plants, all sorts of other stuff together and the runoff from the cows.

Speaker 3:          02:06:57       Good side of your Broccoli and all that jazz. Yeah, it's nasty. And how do you clean that? I mean if I told you that Ecolab was on your vegetables, you still want to eat them. If you clean them, you'd be eating that shit. So how do you clean your vegetables? I rinsed them. Yeah, but I mean, right. But how good usually don't get, I don't know if you knew, like that's the thing, like when people say, Oh, you should clean your vegetables, I will. Okay. But if there was eco lie on those vegetables and you cleaned them, we just think there'll be enough. Probably wouldn't wash your Greens won't protect against Ecolab consumed. There you go. The heat kills. E coli and other types of bacteria can make you sick. Even Greens that are typically consume raw such as Romaine. Lettuce can be cooked. Okay, so equalized. Destroyed at one 60 degrees Fahrenheit, which is seems like everything. Trick analysis. A lot of things killed at one. One 60. So I'm so, but the Broccoli sprouts, you don't, you don't consume cooked?

Speaker 2:          02:07:55       No. Because the enzyme that converts the precursor into active Sulforaphane is heat sensitive.

Speaker 3:          02:08:02       Is it? Um, it, does it diminish it significantly or kill it altogether?

Speaker 2:          02:08:07       Significantly. I mean, you still, there's still some plus the precursor that your, um, that you know, is important for forming silver fain. You actually have bacteria in your gut. And this is, um, something that Dr Jed Fay he talked about, um, when I, when I interviewed him, he was talking about there's certain strains of bacteria in the gut that convert because they have the enzyme myrosinase and they convert it into silver or feeding the gut so you can actually get a certain amount. He also mentioned that you can take, um, mustard seed powder and sprinkle it on top of your cooked Brussels sprouts, your sauteed Kale, which is, this is what I do because I eat sauteed Kale. And so I also have raw. You eat raw kale, mustard powder has the active enzyme so you can consume that. I'm with it. Um, that's the other thing, like I mentioned the, the, there are the supplements I'm taking. There is one out there also that is, has a lot of the precursor and some of the enzyme. And so you can get a modest amount of. And this is what was used in the most recent autism study. Um, it's called Avma call, but the one right spoken

Speaker 3:          02:09:08       like aV , a n wait, avi. Avi m a v a m. Yes. Av know ab and c o l e V m a c o l e V, that one's, that one's probably one of the best ones in the US, but prostate, prostate feigns naturally produce fewer frame. Dr Jed fetty has, has test this, these teas test these different soul supplements and looked at Sulforaphane metabolites in urine to look at like bioavailability. And what is the one that you like? You're prostituting. I like apropos. I've taken both, but it's hard to get in the US. Why is it hard? Because it's made. It's in France. It's a France. Can we get this on Amazon? Know what?

Speaker 3:          02:10:02       Amazon's got me hooked. Now that you can get it, it's just find it somewhere. A legal website maybe. Okay. So that's what I've been taking recently. How much did you take? Um, I'm taking three pills a day. I think each pill has 10 milligrams with food. Yes, definitely. With food for absorption or um, yeah, it seems like it can be a little like, you know, it seems it just sometimes if you're on an empty stomach, doesn't feel good. Yeah. I've had a lot of people email me, you know, since the first time you and I talked about, so for vein, some of them have taken album call, some have gotten a hold of phosphate and some Broccoli sprouts. I mean, I've had people talking about like tumor shrinking and stuff, like one guy. Yeah, I mean it's all anecdotal, but um, I've, I've had multiple, multiple people talking about their prostates stimulating antigen going down.

Speaker 3:          02:11:03       Sorry, prostate. Um, is it stimulating PSA? [inaudible] my brain sort of dwindling out, but I'm not going down. I know it's a real thing. It really is. It's a real thing. I mean I kind of, I feel like I've done really good just from like exercise and getting all the fish oil and stuff, but it's definitely, there's constantly, it's just all you're giving them everything. Totally. It, it's the people that we were talking about this before the podcast with Dan, people that don't think that it's difficult to be a, just a mom or a stay at home mom. You're crazy. I was so judgmental and I really feel bad. I really do because it's the hardest thing. Like, like that. I've, I've ever done a great job. You want to do a good. Oh really? Oh, it's the hardest thing. He goes, Hey, job. You could do with your pajamas on. It's not the hardest thing.

Speaker 3:          02:12:01       I really liked these. Hilarious. Yeah, he's hilarious. He's a great guy. I mean if you want to do a good job and you're thinking about like the enriched environment and how important it is. I gotta do I gotta read to them. I got to know all this and then all the nutrition and knocking the plastic and the. I mean it's just a lot of work. Like, I don't know, screamed you don't want to have like you didn't want to sit them in front of the television and having them watching cartoons, you know, so which definitely would be easy. Right. So, and maybe the more kids you have your kind of like something that I can't but, but uh, it's definitely a very, very hard. It's a hard job but very rewarding. So rewarding. Like I just can't even believe I ever had a life before.

Speaker 3:          02:12:41       My son, you know, I'm just, my life is like, I get so much joy from him now and I'm just like, how do I get all this toy before? It's like, well, it's Christmas. I remember before you had them, you were like, concerned like, boy, I wonder where my time's going to go from still going to be able to do research. It's like, whooo. Yeah, it's hard. And I thankfully I have my mother who helps out a lot and that gives me some time, but I'm like essentially doing both. You know? Do you feel the switches going off in your brain, your brain switches over because you're essentially. There's some, a biological mechanism that's happening. It must be fascinating to study on yourself as you're watching it happen because you're, you know, the oxytocin gets jacked through the roof. You have this little thing that you love literally more than anything you've ever experienced in your entire existence. You can't believe how much you

Speaker 1:          02:13:31       love them. It's hard to imagine like I, it's hard for me as a father to imagine what it would be like to be a mother because I think there's a big difference because I think there's, and this is one of the reasons why me and my wife had a deal. I didn't name any of the kids. I just had veto power. It's like you can't call the kid like fucking turnip or some stupid shit. You know what I mean? Like I mean, it's just nothing. Nobody but you. It's in your body. I mean you're cooking. It impacts you that I know inside of you. The difference in the job a man does and a woman does in terms of like the actual making of the baby could not be further apart from each other. The guy just does something that feels great and it's done, and then the woman goes through this insane hormonal process.

Speaker 1:          02:14:23       Her body morphs. She gains 50, 60 plus pounds. Her body stretches out. She's got a baby inside of her. It's kicking her. She's uncomfortable. She can't move. She's swelling. Then she has to go through excruciating pain. There was a video on dig from yesterday, see if you can find it where they have a labor. I'm recreating like pain device that they put men under and they have these fucking macho men that they have this machine that they do something, they have these a sense these, we'll put it up, we'll figure it out. How the fuck they did it, but it somehow or another reenacts the pain of labor and let's a man experienced what it's like get your vagina

Speaker 3:          02:15:09       blown apart. That's crazy. You know, it is. You just totally explained. I mean the whole pregnancy and then like the delivery and moves just like. And then it's like a part of you is walking around. Whereas for the man, it's like a, yeah, that's my kid. Wow. And you get all this oxytocin rush, but I don't even think it's a fraction of breastfeeding, you know, that whole like nursing, that's like huge. Oxytocin lays huge here and then of course there's the no sleep for like months. And for me, like I, um, my son, like he's seen a bottle like, I don't know, six or seven times. Like I just always been the pool pump. Um, so because I was always there, I, I've only had a pump a few times. The thing about pumping that seems to be really good though is that the kids can get more of it. It's like, depending on how, wherever it had an issue was actually an over producer and I had an issue of too much where, yeah, it's like, he's like, oh mom. Yeah. So I was looking for that and I stumbled across this syndrome. Sympathetic pregnancy is a proposed condition which a partner experience with some symptoms and that's just a bitch ass man. These include minor weight gain, altered hormone levels, morning nausea and disturbed sleep patterns. Like I said, that's just a bitch ass man. Disturb sleep patterns

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       come after the baby's born. Let me tell you that silly mag, but I, I know what you're talking about. Yeah. Some guys say that over again. Again, we're too, and I was pregnant. That's because you're a lazy. That excuse you lazy and he ate more food. You fucking Slob. That has nothing to do with a baby being in your body. Shut your mouth. That's. That's embarrassing. I'm pregnant to now you're not. I hate women. Say we're pregnant. Yeah, we're pregnant. No, we're not. No, we're not pregnant. Mike. You're not pregnant. Mc. She's pregnant. You got her pregnant. You fuck. What does it say here? Labor pain. Simulated here. Here it is. Look at these guys. Do some volume.

Speaker 5:          02:17:19       Talk to me right now. Who Do you almost getting to like the activity

Speaker 1:          02:17:22       stage of labor where it's really getting good. This is the beginning ramps up.

Speaker 5:          02:17:31       Starting to come down on. You guys are doing. I mean it really does.

Speaker 1:          02:17:42       What's next is these gals put a strap on on. They pegged these dudes next. Just have sensors on their stomach it looks like. Right? It's like a, you know, one of them like, you know there's electromuscular stimulation devices and they just jack them through the roof. That could have put one in there. Yeah. Well they put them in their abdomen just getting torn apart, but it's not even as sensitive as your vagina. So it's. Plus you're probably not making like nothing. Yeah, it's nothing. And he's getting up on his hands and knees like, come on, stop. Yeah. They just basically torturing these men to make them feel bad for not being a woman.

Speaker 1:          02:18:28       It's definitely a painful process. That whole delivery thing. It's painful, but it is pretty crazy. It's definitely crazy. It's really crazy that people make people in their bodies. You know? Like I was talking to my daughter this morning, she was getting ready for school and we're sitting at the breakfast table and I'm just looking at her and while she's talking, all I'm thinking of is you didn't use to exist and now here you are talking to me about school, talk to me about this and that and all the different things you're doing and it is so odd that you are a combination of my DNA and my wife's DNA and here you are just sitting here eating breakfast, just talking 10 years old now, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah, blah, blah, blah. Then she tells jokes yet she's not that. Well, she'll, she'll tell jokes, but my eight year old's fucking hilarious.

Speaker 1:          02:19:18       The eight year old has figured out how to be funny. She farts on cue like she'll. She'll tell you. She's got to tell you something, Daddy, I have to tell you. Come here. I tell you some fall. Follow the ground. She thinks it's so funny. She thinks she's. She's really funny. She says funny shit. She's a very funny person. Maybe she's got a little bit what some of the DNA from you is a little more active. I don't know. I think it's like she knows how to get a positive response out of people, you know, she knows how to be silly and she loves that. She's really silly with her friends and she's just like, she's the comedian amongst her friends for sure. Cool. Yeah. Whereas my 10 year old's not really that funny, but just. I wouldn't say she's not that funny. She doesn't try.

Speaker 1:          02:20:04       It's not something she works at. It's also interesting how they're so different and they're like the same environment couldn't be more different. Right out of the box. They come out with their own little personality. Like when they were tiny, tiny babies. You could see that there are different, you know, I bet if you had 10 of them, like those crazy people that was duggar's that have like 19 kids. I bet they got 19 different humans. I, but they're all totally different, you know, a bit one. I like Mike's like shelly, whether they're probably like kind of close. It's just, it's A. I mean I wished that it made sense. I wish I could get a view of the human organism from high enough above that. It all made sense and I and I could say, oh, all these little varying pieces are working in conjunction with each other and this is why things get done and this is why art gets created and, and buildings get built because you have to have a this and then you have to have that and they work together and you know, I mean that's like personalities, right? In terms of relationships. Like you don't want to have two bowls, right? You know, you have one who's like this and the other like that. And together they make this one thing that's really nice and we've both seen, I'm sure people that are just not, they might be really great people, but together they're terrible. Right? Just for whatever reason. Yeah, for sure. It's fascinating. So

Speaker 2:          02:21:33       sober October. Yes. You're going to be doing some. I did I tell you about some of the new stuff in the brain.

Speaker 1:          02:21:38       No new stuff. How new past year ask you before we get going, is there a difference? But because I keep this keeps coming up, is there any beneficial difference between infrared versus standard? Well,

Speaker 2:          02:21:53       one of the studies that I referred to and that had been published have been using a standard, right. And, and the, they definitely work differently. I mean the standard standard Hodson I, you're, you're heating up the air and you're, so, you're, you're, you're getting hot. Whereas the infrared is like, it's like using, it's like wavelengths that are like, you know, stimulating electrons that are sort of changing things and heating up you from a different sort of way. So I, but I do think that the key is the heat stress itself. Um, uh, the personally I, that the standard is better because you get, it's easier to get more hot, more discomfort, more heat stress. It takes a lot longer in an infrared sauna to, to really heat up, at least in my experience, they only go up to 140 or something Fahrenheit. And a lot of benefits come from like one 80 when you get up to like a one 80 Fahrenheit.

Speaker 2:          02:22:44       My cranks, I have to mind your one out here. You're a regular, you're hot. You're right. That thing gets too fucking hot. It gets to 200 all the time. That's what I have to open up the door to your ears start to hurt and it's not even my feet hurt again, it's not even close to pegged. Like in terms of like the, the, the full temperature one, I just have a really hot one. Yeah. So I think that heats really important. Like one of the leg. Yeah, exactly. One 80 for 20 minutes is where it sort of like a lot of studies published by like Dr Dre, you are locking in Finland. He's shown a lot of benefits. Um, he's, a lot of his studies have been observational, but he's also done some intervention trials as well. Um, the observational studies, we've talked about improvements in cardiac, cardiovascular related mortality.

Speaker 2:          02:23:32       Allison, like literally like people, people do it four to seven times a week. They have like a 50 percent improvement in cardiovascular rate of mortality, um, three to four, three to four times a week, or was it two to get three to four times a week to three times a week is like 24 percent improvement. So like a dose dependent manner, Alzheimer's disease as well as reduced by like 60 percent if you do it four to seven times a week, all cause mortality. But he's also done some intervention studies showing that like there's improvements, um, if even a single dose of, of doing the sauna, um, improvements in the ability of your, your, your blood vessels to contract and expand with pressure changes, which is important. So it's like vascular compliance. It's called improvements in blood pressure decreases in, in a Syriac. The protein inflammatory biomarker studies have been showing recently in humans increase in mitochondrial biogenesis, growing new healthy Mitochondria.

Speaker 2:          02:24:24       Improvements in mitochondrial function, um, and then also improve in improvements in a anti inflammatory cytokines being increased in these are all intervention trials as well. People that are doing it with a before doing a workout, which is interesting because I've always done after. Yeah. So, so, so doing it before workout, it reduced delayed onset muscle soreness. I'm doing it before a workout, which is weird because 20 minutes before, I don't remember the exact amount of time. I think that um, it was a little bit of a different protocol for that study. I can't remember off the top of my head. Uh, I did tweet it at some point. Um, but yeah, it's really interesting because I doing it before it seems like I'm so burnt out like after doing the sauna it's like going into a workout after that. So maybe would they have the same effects effects afterwards after, you know, doing it afterwards?

Speaker 2:          02:25:16       Possibly. But what's super interesting is the effects on the brain, like have you noticed, do, do you feel any feel great? Yeah. When I come out of there I feel just chilled out, relaxed, I feel. I feel really good. I just feel good. I feel alleviated. That's exactly the reason I even got interested in Sana was I, that was, I was doing it regularly and I started to notice that I'm. But I recently met up with a researcher. His name is Dr Charles Raison, um, I recorded a podcast with him. Very interesting guy, but he, a devised this really cool gadget where he could elevate people's core body temperature by like a, a degree and a half, but he had a sham control, a placebo, so to speak. And um, so, so the placebo did increase people's core body temperature a little bit, but not to that amount, not to that degree.

Speaker 2:          02:26:07       So people thought they were getting the active treatment so they weren't hot. They were, they thought they were getting high. And in fact he said when asked afterwards, like 70 percent of them thought they got the active treatment. So yeah, so it's actually a nice placebo controlled study. But um, what he found was that even a single treatment, these weren't people that had major depressive disorder. It improved depressive symptoms like even a week, week after. And this was just a single, you know, exposure to the sauna, what sauna. It's not actually a sign I was like this like heating device. But um, he also measured their, a cytokine called io six, which is something that's released from exercise muscle tissue releases. It spills out into the bloodstream and it's part of the inflammatory response, part of the inflammatory aspect of exercise. And in response there's a whole anti-inflammatory, um, effect.

Speaker 2:          02:26:59       And so, um, what he showed is that actually people with the more aisle six that happened, the better they had, um, antidepressant effect. So it's super interesting because, uh, again, exercise does that and in fact, if you give people ensades or like, you know, so nonsteroidal anti inflammatories, um, and, and before exercise, it actually blunts the aisle six production and it blends some of the positive benefits like insulin sensitivity. So the aisle six, although it's an inflammatory cytokine, it's kind of like this, a sort of a pleiotropic one that it's released, it's in muscle tissue, it's released and it seems to like increase, have a big anti inflammatory response that happens in response to that. So it was really interesting because the inflammation seems to be really important for depression and that the sauna was like, you know, basically basically lowering markers of inflammation. So it's been shown to lower c reactor protein and then also increase aisle 10. So it's a very interesting kind of connection between mood, um, heat stress. And then of course exercise is the same thing. Exercise does elevate your core body temperature and heats you up. And I asked, uh, Dr Liaison, he thinks that things like the sauna, hot yoga, hot bath, steam room, all those things are pretty much can give you the same effect. The point is the heat stress, it's, I'm pretty sure that yoga does the same with hot yoga because I have that same

Speaker 4:          02:28:22       feeling when I get out of a hot yoga class. It, this is like really good alleviation feeling. I just, my mood feels elevated, I feel happier and it feels different than a regular workout, like regular workout does that. But it seems more, uh, an alleviation of stress. Like, I've expelled the excess energy in my body and I can relax and there's certainly some sort of, um, uh, some sort of a positive hormonal effect after it's over. You know, some endorphin rush. But it's not the same as the yoga. The hot yoga I think is very addictive to people and that's one of the reasons because after it's over, you feel amazing. You feel so good.

Speaker 2:          02:29:02       There's studies showing that hot yoga does improve depressive symptoms. They're not, there's no plus, you know, sham control. I think there's a researcher at Harvard Public School of Health who's trying to develop, trying to do a study with how you're doing it right now. Are they with her with a control random and now they're in the

Speaker 4:          02:29:18       about yoga is that it's only 104 degrees in the room. But when you take into account the extreme condition of the exercise, extreme stress that you're putting on your body, a lot of it is like really difficult balancing and you're straining and all your mind, your fucking sweating and you're not sweating like 100, four degrees. You're sweating just like you're sweating inside the song, right?

Speaker 2:          02:29:38       Like big time sweat. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:29:41       Like there's certain ones that are like, when you're do a bouncing stick, what? I'm standing in front of me like this and I'm watching it just pour off my arms just watching sweat drip off me.

Speaker 2:          02:29:52       I sweat when I'm doing yoga, like non what I'm holding those positions in a non hot environment, you know. So I haven't, I've done a big room yoga a couple of times. I've been the hot yoga a couple of times. Um, I do really like it instead of have more time to see what might be minutes is a long time. Um, but, but the Endorphin, you dump a bunch of endorphins with uh, the sauna as well, like tons and tons. And then there's the whole, like, you're, you're making dynorphins which is the sort of opposite of endorphin responsible for that. Um, so that changes some of the least in animal studies at Petronas to change the sensitivity to endorphins. I'm from the receptor standpoint. So it's kind of interesting. That's kind of initially what I, what I originally was looking into when I was noticing all these benefits from the sauna, but that's really cool that you're doing it because there's so many studies now showing that there's benefits on the cardiovascular health.

Speaker 2:          02:30:46       I'm also on neurogenic disease depression. I mean the antiinflammatory effects as well. It's so easy to have it. I have it right here and just to be able to get into the sauna anytime I want. I basically doing it every day. That's nice. Yeah. Right now I've been taking hot baths just because I haven't, we're, we're, we're trying to like get to the point where we have a sauna but um, I think we're gonna get there soon. But a hot baths had been doing it for me as well where I am like submerge my shoulders. I mean you can't, like if you start putting your arms and legs out of the water, like it doesn't count because I feel cooler if you'd like stay underneath.

Speaker 3:          02:31:20       I mean you're freaking out. You're heart starts racing, racing. I mean it's like the same effect that happens where you're elevated heart rate and all those sort of similar mechanisms kick into play like they do when you're in a sauna. Do you do epsom salt baths as well? I have. I really like them, but I've been doing really hot baths with epsom salts, especially like after a very fatiguing workouts seems to have a good benefit and and I know from the tank, from the isolation tank that it's a great way of absorbing magnesium through the epsom salts. Oh, into your muscle through through skin, because epsom salts is so high in magnesium in the tank is a thousand pounds of epsom salts in it. It's crazy to make your skin look nice when you do it. Yeah, it just feels good too, but it's a. It feels really the tank.

Speaker 3:          02:32:08       Have you done it yet? I did it once. I'm in San Francisco and you can do it anytime you want if you want to come here. I think it was really something wasn't right because I could feel like the temperature of the water was off and I did enjoy what I. what, I mean it was nice. So at first I got in and they had some music playing music and then the music went away. Oh, to sort of relax you at first. Yeah. Um, but uh, I did, I was like sort of in my head a bit, you know, in that. But I didn't, I kept feeling the water and I thought I didn't feel like I was like sensory deprived if you ever hear other than like when you come down and do the podcast. Um, yeah, I do. I'm coming back in November. Anytime you're here just let me know in advance and we'll open it up.

Speaker 3:          02:32:57       And this tank here is the best. The float lab or if you want to go to the place in Venice, but the one you can do here so easy and it's got a shower in there and everything. Yeah, that would be cool. I would like to try it again. Yeah, I mean there's studies showing, you know, meditation and all that stuff is really important for it. I think it's an important one. One of the many components and like healthy aging, healthy brain aging, lowering stress and stuff. Um, so I would definitely like to get out of that thing. I feel great. I'll come frequently. So that's right here. So I'll come down here early in the morning and do it sometimes. How long do you have to stay in there to really. I like at least an hour, but I really like to do two hours. Two hours for me is the sweet spot.

Speaker 3:          02:33:37       When I come out after two hours I'm just like, so chill out and it's almost like doing sober October. It's like cheating because you're basically getting high in there. Are you doing it during. So it worked out, but yeah, I mean it's not, you're not taking a drug but you're so chilled out, you know, and you do have a weird psychedelic state that you achieve when you. It's like a very extreme form of meditation and a lot of ways because of the fact that you're not feeling your body at all and it's, you're only experiencing whatever's going on. It's like your brain detached from all the input of the body. Some of those, some of those studies that have been done on like long term meditators or even just people that haven't meditated

Speaker 2:          02:34:18       and then they're put in like some like eight week trial of meditation and how there's like immediately all these changes in brain activity start to happen like that are basically in line with good brain aging and improved. You know, all sorts of measures or measures have improved cognitive function and stuff. It's super interesting. It would be really interesting to see like, you know what, how that differs from meditations. One thing I have a hard time with like I real, it's well, meditation and

Speaker 1:          02:34:46       injunction with the tank I think is really the key. I think the tank allows you to achieve a state of physical, your physical body not being or not I. You don't ever completely eliminate the sensory input, but you diminish it so significantly that that environment is not available anywhere else on earth where you're floating so you don't feel your body. Your water is the temperature of your skin. The air is the same temperature as the water and you feel like just flying through infinity, you're in total darkness. Total silence.

Speaker 2:          02:35:19       Yeah. I didn't feel that way. I mean I did. It was a little relaxed. I didn't feel like I was like flying through

Speaker 1:          02:35:25       for tanks. That's, that's part of the problem. Some of the tanks, the water the entire time, they're probably either too cold or too hot.

Speaker 2:          02:35:32       It should. You feel like your brain is like a in the now when you're doing it. Is that something.

Speaker 1:          02:35:37       I feel like my brain is has way more resource reece way more resources available to it. So like if you and I are having this conversation and we didn't have the headphones on and there was a Jack Hammer next to us, it would be really distracting. You'd want to get away from that Jackhammer, like let's go talk over here until you'd want. You'd want to get away as far as you could from. But everything is a distraction. Like the seat on my butt is a distraction with the shoes on my feet or something. I'm thinking about the watch on my hand. Does all these different things that are distracting you, but when you get in that tank, there's none of those things you're, you're just, you settle in and once you settle in, you touch each side so that you can, you know, because you get in the waters like a few whip ripples and little little waves and then you touch each side.

Speaker 1:          02:36:25       So you calm everything down and then I sink into the water and then I take some deep breaths and then I slowly bring my arms, the middle and then a chill out and I've done it so many times my body's goes, okay, here we go again. Like it's not like, Whoa, what is this? This is a weird. I've done it so many times that my body gets into that state very quickly. But if I take time off and I do, sometimes I'll take weeks or even a month off and then it's a little more weird at first. Like, oh, we're doing this again. Oh, I haven't done this in awhile, but when I do it consistently on a regular basis to three times a week, then I could just sink right into it.

Speaker 2:          02:37:02       I wonder if it would be any therapeutic benefit to people with like sensory gating disorders, sensory gating, our, you know, in other words, like you were mentioning all the senses, other sensory things that are happening, you know, there's auditory, there's, there's a visual. I mean these things are our brains inputting it at all times. I mean there's stuff going on but we're able to kind of filter it out and like you and I are having this conversation. Jamie's been sitting over the whole time and like I really haven't paid much attention, right. Attention thing. But some people like particularly schizophrenia, people with schizophrenia, they can't, they don't filter that out. And so like they get overlooked but gets like an overload. It's called sensory overload. And so they oftentimes, I can't go into like a room with a lot of people. They want to like go off and you know, with, you know, by themselves or whatever. So I wonder if there's any sort of a benefit for like doing something like that where you're, where you're not, you know, the sensory inputs, Kinda like if you could kind of train your brain a little bit. I don't know. I don't know.

Speaker 1:          02:37:59       Um, I just, I, I find that for me it, it helps me think way clear because I feel like I have more brain available to access. I feel like if you were trying to say something that was very, very complicated and you're trying to explain something that required a lot of the resources of your brain. If there was a lot of noise around you, you wouldn't be able to do it. But if there was a lot of noise you like, you want to eat, let's go eat and you're like Bah Bah Bah Bah Bah Ba. Some Jack Hammer. He, I'm hungry. You wanna eat. Yeah, let's go eat. Like you could be able to communicate something very simple, but if you were trying to explain the, the various mechanisms are really try this because I think it

Speaker 2:          02:38:37       go through like this. I also sometimes use the sauna for that. We're all like, have something prepared. I used to actually, before giving a presentation, I would go in the sauna and I would go through it in my head, you know, so it's like, you know, that was something that I used to do a lot.

Speaker 1:          02:38:54       There's nothing in there, just you sitting there and it gives you that unusual environment of just silence really helped. Yeah. So it's kind of interesting that you mentioned that that's a step toward, but I think the, the float tank is the ultimate and right now there's a really interesting podcast that's available. Um, I've, I've talked with this podcast before, stuff to blow your mind. They have a, an episode right now, this week that is about John Lilly, who was the psychedelic pioneer who created the sensory deprivation tank and he also is a pioneer and interspecies communication. Figured out how to communicate with dolphins and did a bunch of weird psychedelic research with dolphins. Sarah is from the vault, John C dot Lilly. He a really amazing, amazing guy who uh, uh, I mean if you go, they go deep into the history of his, his career too, which is just very varied.

Speaker 1:          02:39:52       Fucking really strange guy, but I think is his great contribution is not just understanding the sentient nature of dolphins and how incredibly complex their languages and how smart they are, but also the sensory deprivation tank, which I think is one of the most underutilized tools for consciousness, for exploring consciousness and just relaxation and for me for examining ideas. If I have an idea like I used to do, I just do a lot of Jujitsu and they're like, I would go into the tank and I would go over moves because when you're, when you're completely, I would, I would drill moves in my head like as if I was doing them, I would like clench, hook, roll, talk, grab sync. I would do all these different things in my head. Yeah. And that would allow. I would do that to get me to this like relaxation state and now or I would go over a joke that I'm struggling with or a comedy bit.

Speaker 1:          02:40:48       I'm like, what is a better way to say this? How's, what's the best way to get this across? Now I'm saying it this way, but it's offensive or it's blunt and it's not the funny part. Like I'm, I'm taking a shortcut. Maybe I, and then I would go over it in my head and then eventually once I would do that, I would get to this relaxation point where then I could just concentrate only on breathing. So after I've worked out all the things that are bugging me and sometimes it would be like a seminar on my life, I'd get in there. And then as soon as I closed the door and lay down, I'd take a few deep breaths and then it'd be like, okay, so here's what's wrong. Fuck face. You're doing too much of this, cleaned you God damn office. You know, how come you, uh, you only get eight out of 10 things down in your to do list that's bothering you.

Speaker 1:          02:41:35       You know, you need to spend an hour a day just doing this. And instead of drinking coffee and looking at your phone before you work out, just fucking workout, just get in there and get your. You're wasting 20 minutes doing that. That 20 minutes you could have been done 20 minutes earlier and then you wouldn't have to rush over here to do the podcast and it's like, it starts sort of giving me almost like a subconscious of renovation, you know, like just, it's just sort of like, okay, like this is all this stuff and your subconscious is disturbing you and here's why it's disturbing you because you've got all this clutter, so let's clean this shit up, clean it up, get it together. And it's been responsible for, I think a lot of my focus and discipline, like understanding the significance of that focus and discipline and it's not just like to be a tough guy or the just go out there and kick ass.

Speaker 1:          02:42:28       It's more like to absolve yourself of brain clutter. That's pretty awesome. That introspection, you're talking about, a lot of people could use more of that, including myself. I mean it's certainly, I think all of us. I think it almost really anyone listening to this, and I think there's probably one in San Diego, so if there's a tank place in San Diego, reach out to Dr Rhonda Patrick and I'm sure that there's a place you could use this down there. This near you. I mean I certainly use other things like a extra running long runs should do something similar in that zone, but what you're describing sounds kind of like next level. A lot of people get it from swimming as well. Swimming because it was just like, yeah, that repetitive thing and then you're sort of managing the motion of your body and then once you get in it's almost like a mantra. You managing the motion of your body and then the breathing and then once you get it all sync up. If you're in good enough shape that it's not like a titanic struggle with every, every lap or every stroke of your arms. You can get into the sort of meditative state that a lot of people achieve with running or, or even with. Just like sitting there and breathing like a lot of people get that. I have a difficult time doing that, but no, it's hard. Yeah. Is it a funny. That'd be hard to sit still.

Speaker 2:          02:43:46       It is. It is funny because actually like that some of the other interesting stuff is just doing that, sit there, sit still and breathe changes like the activation of enzymes and stuff like telomerase. The enzyme that rebuilds telomeres get. We literally activates telomerase so, so fascinating. How just like certain things like, like I wouldn't imagine doing that. Would it actually, you know, changed telomerase

Speaker 1:          02:44:11       bodies. This is never ending puzzle. It really is. And whenever I talked to you a more and more sort of aware of that because there's so many different things in so many different mechanisms and in terms of nutrition and nutritional absorption that I just, I'm so ignorant of and it's. I hear all these things and I'm like, I'm trying to, trying to get a map of the territory and I make also, there's so many things I'm injured, but I feel like every time I talk it's like someone's breaking out a little napkin and going, hey, I know you take a right here and you go there and I go, all right, but it's not a real map. Like the map of the whole thing escapes me. It's too big. It's too big. It's too complex and I'll listen to this podcast again, like I'll listen to all the things you said again and I'll try to take notes maybe tomorrow or the next day, but then my stupid brain will like, it'll like leak. Half of it will leak out. It's like I'm trying to hold water in my fingers. It's like I got it. I've got some water and stop fucking dripping down my wrists. So hard, so hard to get a, a real understanding of this stuff.

Speaker 2:          02:45:20       I agree. I mean, certainly lots of controversy and disagreement among researchers as well, you know, don't you think

Speaker 1:          02:45:26       also probably one, what's so attractive about simplifying things like Hashtag meet heels, you know what I mean? Like people almost like, yeah, let's just jam it into a saying or jam it into like one type of practice and that's all you need. That's all you need. I need is meat. Look at me. I'm just eating meat. Filling. Great. I feel amazing. And then people are like, oh, I want to feel amazing. And then they jump into.

Speaker 2:          02:45:49       Yep.

Speaker 1:          02:45:55       You already saw me get emotional. I was, yeah. No, I'm glad you did. I'm glad you did get emotional and I'm glad you did sort of spell it out and I hope I'm going to send this to Jordan afterwards. I don't know if he has the time to listen to it. He might have less than us,

Speaker 3:          02:46:10       you know, guys pretty busy. But maybe when he's, you know, moving, going from one place to another on plane or whatever. Yeah. Um, I just think that it's a movement right now and you've got to be real careful about movements because you get swept up in him and you're like, Hey, I'm moving in the right way. I don't know if this is the right way to move, but a move. Yeah. So. Alright, well look, we just did three hours. Nice. Crazy. Time flies. I always love talking with you, Joe. I always love talking with you too. It's fun. I'm going to take you up on the flotation thing because I really do any time, any time. Call me up. It's yours. Just give me some time. Just give me like a little bit in advance. We'll open the place up for you. Awesome. Alright. Thank you. Alright. Oh, give people found my fitness on Instagram, found my fitness on twitter. I'm itunes, itunes, your podcasts. And the most recent one, which is the one that we were discussing was about Alzheimer's. And a website is also found my, yeah, there's a lot of, uh, there's a lot of show notes and summaries and definitions that help people like, you know, I understand some of the stuff if they don't understand everything that we're speaking about. So thank you very much. Awesome. Thank you Rhonda. Patrick. Ladies. Gentlemen.
