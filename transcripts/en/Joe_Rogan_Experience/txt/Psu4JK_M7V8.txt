Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Start recording, Bam. So having right now, but just says off air though,

Speaker 2:          00:00:07       this is all fair.

Speaker 1:          00:00:10       Oh, well you have to refresh that screen.

Speaker 2:          00:00:12       Anyone else? Too High.

Speaker 1:          00:00:26       Alright, here we go. We're live. Bitches. It's me and Batman. Batman with me. So I don't fuck around. This is a, some new show. Everybody with this is. This is some new bad ass jacket that you can get that allows you to also be a robber. You can be a bank robber and you don't even have to wear a ski mask and look suspicious. You just. This is like a mask that comes with this fucking this thing

Speaker 2:          00:00:55       show everybody. Show everybody. How does that

Speaker 1:          00:01:01       turns into the hood? It's a hood, but it's a mask. So in these hard economic times, why is this? Is there another version of that window?

Speaker 2:          00:01:22       She was the girl that died, that snored that giant line account. Really? I don't really know she died, but people in the Internet you're saying, should I?

Speaker 1:          00:01:32       Alright, what's up bitches? How's everybody doing? We got two things going on here. We got this, uh, this um, twitter thing where you can, um, if you twitter your questions, we'll answer your questions for that. Or if you go to my website, which is a forums Joe Rogan.net,

Speaker 2:          00:02:00       people asking you questions. God dammit. This one fella? Yeah, he apologized. That's good. Alright. What's happened at fuckers? What's going on? Can we some questions? Some good ones.

Speaker 1:          00:02:23       How many bond here tonight? We haven't taken anything.

Speaker 2:          00:02:25       Baguettes. We've only used a little little pipe that some of the gaming. No bond hits bitches. Bong hits for Jesus Salads.

Speaker 1:          00:02:40       John's microphone. Where I see that it's not really, that doesn't do it. Somebody does it for him, why he's doing it, but they're doing a really good job getting all the information. Here's his Christmas dinner was like he had Charlie Sheen to talk

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       about. He had terrorism to talk about how somehow they connected with each other.

Speaker 1:          00:03:04       Yeah. He'll probably have some thing. Well, Charlie didn't do anything.

Speaker 3:          00:03:10       The government doesn't want Charlie out there and talking about nine slash 11.

Speaker 1:          00:03:15       I'm half Joey Diaz. Half Alan knows that that's too high, ladies and gentlemen, to to be doing a show. This is ridiculous. The weed that they have here in California is just too goddamn strong. Ladies. Gentlemen. It's medical. You could just buy it from a fucking store. Should is outrageous

Speaker 3:          00:03:35       and it's train wreck. That's nice. That's like one of the best scores you can get.

Speaker 1:          00:03:38       I don't like how you guys are looking down at me. Makes for uncomfortable. I wish we're looking eye to eye on the same level. I'm going to have to set this up so that we're looking at eye. It feels weird looking time.

Speaker 3:          00:03:49       Yes, smart monitor. I can trade you. You're so nice.

Speaker 1:          00:03:54       Question, question, question. Let's go to the Rogan board. We're going to go to two forums, dot Joe Rogan.to the official 12 slash 29 ustream ustream podcast thread where the questions are not limited to a gay 140 characters. That shit's ridiculous. Do you think there will be one world government in our life or do you think it will act and and how do you think it will actually affect us? I think that's possible. It's very possible if they can get the money sorted out between all these fucking scumbags at Ronnie's world governments. Yeah. They would all agree to one gigantic system of government. The problem with one gigantic system of government it is though, even though it would be harder for corruption, it will be. It's also harder to keep people in line because you have to have enemies. You have to have like, you know the, the Turks hate the fucking Iranians hate the hate the Vac. If you don't have that conflict, it's very difficult to keep people in line, you know? And if we were all the United States of America, then we started arguing about money. We started arguing about taxes. We started, you know, if we're all one thing, it makes it very difficult to do, but as far as like giant international banks, they might already be in cahoots or close enough to one world government. I mean there might be a few that are really pulling the strings and running things. But I mean,

Speaker 3:          00:05:08       yeah, because the future, if that government was just the Internet, so if we can be wanting to vote, it was just like going on a message board in voting like hey, so we have legal insurance vote now. That would be critical. Good. That'd be like for the people. But then people would hack it. Yeah. No, it's, it's all good on paper. But you know, anything that you do on the Internet now, like two to play poker, you never know if you're playing poker against a real dude, you know, you could easily be playing poker. It's a computer, right? I mean I don't know what kind of programs they run, but it seems to me like at this point in time people can hack just about anything they can. I mean there's, there's programs like that's the problem with these drones. They have. You heard about this, those drones can actually hacking into the drones. Like the airplanes. This drones. I checked the borders and stuff there. Yeah. Well they don't just check borders. They launched missiles. They have these fucking things, these drones that shoot these called Hellfire

Speaker 4:          00:05:58       missiles and they use them in Pakistan and all these places where we're not really supposed to bake and they just fly in and Jack People. Well, the insurgence have figured out how to hack the code and actually view the Monitor. It's, it's crazy shit, man. Speaking of crazy shit. I really do have to say shit. We plan this out bad. So I'm going to take a shit and Brian's going to answer questions

Speaker 5:          00:06:18       and that's a $29 program that, that, that they use just to hack our videos. So you ask questions. I'll be asking questions from here to. There is a toilet in his office. What is your opinion? Uh, that's good. In fact, at twitter, Joe doesn't make the extract listerine packages. It's actually one of the products that's sold here in California. When you have a medical marijuana license, you can go to a store and they saw the listerine at the store. Like it looks like listerine strips a. So now he doesn't make them himself. Joe Has not seen avatar yet. We're the last two people to see Avatar and we're supposed to see it this week. It's pretty annoying. Not being the last one to see it. Underwear bomber was staged. Any thoughts they did from the the airplane stage under coverage? The government man, the government. I think he's just a retard. Joe just thinks he's a retard.

Speaker 1:          00:07:48       I think it shows you how fragile our system is. Now. The one guy to do one stupid thing in the whole world grinds to a halt and security. It takes five hours. Now

Speaker 5:          00:07:57       you guys probably didn't hear that, but he thinks it's pretty ridiculous how one guy did all of that and that's how bad our security is and now our shit's all fucked up from that one. Dig. Yeah. Security lines are five hours long, right?

Speaker 1:          00:08:09       One guy shows you how fragile this system knows.

Speaker 5:          00:08:15       Joel is not. We're not reading the chat on Ustream. Joe Is only doing the twitter, so if you have a message joe answered. If you put on twitter or Joe Rogan's website, which is forums dot Joe Rogan.net. He's taking a shit right now so he'll be right back. It's the coffee. Sorry, it's the starbucks coffee. Um, let's see. Let's go back to the. Alright, let me go read some messages on chose website forum style. Joe Rogan.net. Joe would be right back. Let's go. Uh, almost 300. Yeah. I have the dark vader, a mark Ecko sweatshirt. Asa. But yeah, that Boba Fett wins. Pretty sweet. I have realized though. It's pretty gay when you're by yourself. Not with friends, but these sweatshirts. There's the Boba Fett.

Speaker 1:          00:10:32       Is it? Oh yeah. You know, I think Mark Lehman had one of those new war to the UFC. Mark Layman is a, he's a comic book nerd and a, an a, a Jujitsu freeing. Teaches a lot of guys who fight fighting the world. Jujitsu. And he's a, he's a big video game junkie. And he had a Boba Fett one on pretty dope. Pretty Dope. Alright. Questions? Questions from the twitter world is my twitter tweet deck.

Speaker 5:          00:11:04       I couldn't get to refresh it and I think it's the API thing against. You may want to close that and use the ustream one only.

Speaker 6:          00:11:09       Okay. I see it's not closed yet. Just shut off that

Speaker 1:          00:11:23       right twitter on ustream. Let's go with the questions here. Bitches. What am I back in Ireland. I'm not going to be back in Ireland until the UFC back in Ireland. It's not financially feasible for me to make those trips without the UFC to the UK, but every time I'm there, if there's a show, if we're going, if we're doing a UFC in Ireland for sure I'll be doing standup comedy there. They could hear the flesh. Can you hear me? Did you want me to take it down? It was so strong I couldn't resist it. I knew I had to go. I didn't want to. I want to do. I wanted to be able to just man up and push through the whole use dream, but I was like, I'm going to do a bad job. Does I'm just be thinking about this dump I have to take. So what was, what were we talking about before I took off? Because it was kind of important stuff.

Speaker 6:          00:12:18       Uh Huh.

Speaker 1:          00:12:24       I think the one road thing is the last thing you talked. Oh, that was the first question. The one world government, our lifetimes, I don't know man. I used to, I had a lot more faith before Obama got elected. I'll tell you that I thought that maybe what we had was a corrupt situation and you know, the Bush and Cheney were corrupt in that if we got somebody else in there, maybe they could straighten everything out. But after Obama got elected, man it, it became pretty clear to me that someone else besides the president obviously is pulling the strings. Obama didn't want to send more troops. Obama didn't want to go to Afghanistan to bring more people to Afghanistan and he wanted to pull out a Guantanamo Bay, close Guantanamo Bay, don't all that shit, but it's not. I don't think he gets to say what the fuck they do or he was just saying that kind of shit to get elected.

Speaker 1:          00:13:10       You know, the, the old Bill Hicks, Joe comes to mind. You know that American politics is a, you know, I like the puppet on the right. Well, I find the puppet to the left to be more to my liking. Hey, wait a minute. There's one guy who's holding both puppets. I think it's right. What are you doing? Oh, it's not doing anything. I'm just. I know what you're just tracking the shit you had to hang up on the screen. Moving shit around. Fucking psycho. He's a tweaker but not like the pine. Mckee has come more to optimize my internet's. He's the kind of due to hacks into his registry to make us internet like one kbh faster.

Speaker 5:          00:13:44       You're one of those dudes, right? You remember when computers first came out and uh, do you ever. I always had, I had a friend that said that he could hack into the library and like get rid of all the, do fees and stuff like that. I always wondered if that was real

Speaker 1:          00:13:55       for my Lego. Well, definitely there were some systems that you could hack into if you were a wizard. You know, isn't that what nick did a lot of shit with like phone calls. Right. Did like get information from people. Like it wasn't even that he was this great hacker was just. She was kind of like a con man.

Speaker 5:          00:14:11       Tighter way. Did you read that? They just hacked the like a 21 year old code that a ramp that scrambles or phone calls on cell phones so now and the guys, the hackers put it on the Internet so anyone could have it. So now, I mean of course it's probably not going to happen to us anytime soon, but now there's actually people that have the code to that they can listen to your phone and listen to your phone calls. Holy Shit. Twenty one year old code, like a 64 bit code. I think that's where the

Speaker 1:          00:14:43       just headed to. I think that's where I think that's the future. The future is there's not going to be any private information. I think what we're seeing with like this tiger

Speaker 4:          00:14:52       woods thing, I think we're seeing the future of things to come. I mean with him, it's obviously that he's a celebrity and it's a. But the way that everybody is swarming after this information. Me Too, man, I can't fucking put down and US weekly. If I see an US weekly at the market and there's some new tiger woods information I grabbed that I can't fucking help it. You know, will I think eventually there's not gonna be any secrets. I think eventually we're going to get to a point where the way information is being distributed, it's changing the way we feel about information. I mean it's a weird with celebrities. It's one thing, you know, we're looking at it like, well these are famous people and it's like they give up that right once, once you start, you know, putting yourself in the public eye, you give up that right to privacy. Well eventually that's going to happen. Like it's happening with facebook accounts to like girls are doing stupid shit in their facebook accounts and he gets all the internet and they go, well you know she gave up her right when she put it on facebook.

Speaker 5:          00:15:46       It's like that new google goggles where you can just take a photo of anything and it figures out what it is and then search is it for you. So you can now like go to a, like a VC, like a can of pop can take a picture of it and knows what it is. Google say, but you can see it starting to get where you can. They're going to do it where you can do flowers and plants and anything's A. Pretty soon everything's going to be google search, so there is no privacy. So while I'm here I could, you know what I mean?

Speaker 4:          00:16:15       Yeah, yeah. I mean eventually I'm sure that shit is going to make its way into your house.

Speaker 5:          00:16:20       Well, it's already in Google goggles came out on the,

Speaker 4:          00:16:23       you know what I mean? I mean you'll be able to search someone's house, so yeah, take a photo and you'll be able to go, oh, this guy lives at 97 woodcrest road. People only have

Speaker 5:          00:16:32       five years ago. You put a picture on your facebook, a Christmas photo that has like your bookshelf in the background. Now present day that that's going to start researching every single book that's on your shelf and it's gonna put in a database somewhere and, and GPS location. You know what I mean? So like when you're searching for something, you could be like, oh, Joe has that book at home.

Speaker 4:          00:16:50       I think what's happening? I think what's happening with twitter and what's happening with facebook and what's happening with the just the Internet in general is there's way more connectivity between all human beings and a part of that is access to information so that information is not going to be lucky. It is now. It's not going to be private, I think. No, I think eventually technology will come to the point where the line will be absolutely impossible and you will know everything that everybody else knows and everyone's going to try to hold back on it for awhile because people have a lot of dirty secrets. They do a lot of creepy shit, but I think ultimately it's probably going to be good for everybody. I do think that that's where we're headed. I think we're headed to a point where everybody has access to all the information that everybody else has and not just like go on the Internet and you search for it.

Speaker 4:          00:17:36       Not like in the rudimentary way. We have to actively look for. I think it's going to be right there. I think there's going to eventually come. There's gonna. They're gonna. Eventually get to a point where there's some sort of technology that's created that allows human minds interface with other human minds. I think that that's definitely where this was all going. I mean when there's talk of neural implants and all these different things, people think that's all crazy, but that's. That's a small step from where we are in comparison to where we were just a couple hundred years ago. I mean a couple hundred years ago, the fastest mode of transportation was riding a fucking animal. Think about that. You have to write 300 years ago, the fastest ship on land is to ride an animal or have an animal pull you behind something with wheels or slave slaves. Can't run as fast as some of those guys can.

Speaker 4:          00:18:23       No Way. Not a horse. This guy's an idiot. I can't believe I'm doing this, but I mean think about what a Banya mental leap between the transference of information today in 2009 and in 17. Oh, nine. I mean, think about what we can do right now. We could send a fucking picture across, you know, space is, send it through the air and then literally arrives. I mean if I have a friend in the UK and I want to send him a picture and a text message, I can take the picture, send it, and it gets to him just like that. I mean, that's fucking incredible. I mean, it literally will get there in seconds. We don't even. We can't even fathom how nuts that is because we do it all the time. What's coming next is going to make that seem like riding a horse.

Speaker 4:          00:19:11       That's what's happening. That's what I think is happening. That's what I think is this whole this, this rush for inflammation and everybody has this insane desire that human beings have for the newest, greatest, latest technology. You know, even when you don't need it, like people are always trying to pump up their computers. The only reason why you need a pumped up computer really is to play video games or if you're, you're crunching a video like, like he needs stuff like that when he, when he makes videos just for raw computing power. But the average person does is not crunching video.

Speaker 7:          00:19:42       You hit a wall. We've hit a wall and computers in general, like they really don't need even like the fastest computers now. The programs that video programs aren't even. Yeah. That's why everybody's into those little notebooks. You know, those notebooks are the shit except for watching like hd videos. Yeah. That's kind of sucks. And you can't, you can't load a cd into it either. A DVD, right? Yeah. But that technologies like talking about the floppy drive right before the floppy drive left, you know, like cds and dvds are out the door. Even Blu rays have like such a small shelf life and you think it's ever going to get to a point where bandwidth will be so broad and like mobile functions like laptops and phones, like those little mobile cards, it'll be so powerful that it will be just like your home. Oh, it's totally. It's going to be all of that pretty soon. So it'll basically be like, everything will be broad man. Do we even know what the fuck that is doing to human beings? You know, like the talking about cell phones causing radiation and you know, like when they say it's bad when we say it's okay. Well I think, do you think that it's possible that that's like altering human beings given kids autism? Probably not, right? It might be that. It might be that

Speaker 4:          00:20:48       it might also be fucking with bees. There's been speculation that it's been fucking with bees and there's also been speculation that at some, some crazy virus of read that as well. But there's also been speculation that Wifi signals and cell phone signals, they have fucks with b's ability to transmit. We did a thing for fear factor in once with bees on it and it was a fucking trip because this guy was a beekeeper. Any, uh, you know, I had all these bs that he brought with him. So the stunt was these dudes, they had to be strapped to this pole. We strap them to the pole and then we cover them with bs and they have to stand there for like five minutes. Tim Riggins fucked up because every now and then, you know, the bees were argue or something. They'd sting to dude and it was bad.

Speaker 4:          00:21:24       I got stung up. Well while this was all going on and while this guy's tendencies, bees and caring for these bees, a local swarm of bees came in so our bees and their bees, we're talking it out and we had a backup. Everybody had to get off the set. We had to close down the set. We had to close down the stock and everybody had to move back and the beekeeper say, and we've got, you know, a local local band of bees is moved in. I forget what he calls him a hive or I don't know, but that's like a no, I don't know, whatever. A local band to bees moved into to sort it out with these bees. So our bees and their bees were just this fucking swarm in the sky. And they were fighting. They were just talking like, so what's up?

Speaker 4:          00:22:05       What are you guys do? And I'll work with your doctor, you know, working with fear factor. We've got some dudes are going to cover them and bees and shit. They're like working out what was going on. And then they resolved their differences and the local bees went a separate way and then the, his be stayed. Was it like a black cloud? That's correct. It was not. It was a big fucking cloud of bees in the air. And the bees were communicating. Where's your cell phone? Why weren't you filming back is back in the day. He didn't have a [inaudible] no. Nineteen or whatever role. We had a press four times to get it as bad as little Motorola ea 15. It was one of those.

Speaker 4:          00:22:42       But um, so, uh, we, we, they wonder if that's fucking with bds, if our cell phone signals and everything are fucking with beings that autism thing, man, it might be something totally like that. It also, you know, a lot of speculation about autism is the age of the parents and that the women are having babies like into their thirties and forties. And that increases the risk. A lot of people talked about that. That's um, it's very, very possible. Makes Sense, man. You know, when we're just older and smarter and we look at it now and we say, well God, you know, how stupid would it be to have a kid when you're 18? When you're 18, you're an idiot, which is absolutely true, but when you're an 18 year old idiot, your genetics are much stronger and you could, you could have a kid and the kid probably wouldn't be as fucked up. I mean, the reality is even though we're lengthening our lifetimes with nutrition and you know, science and we're figuring out a way to make people live longer, people aren't supposed to live much longer than like 50. You know, back in the day if you lived to be 50, holy Shit, you pulled off an amazing,

Speaker 7:          00:23:42       you know, but not, not anymore. Now people

Speaker 4:          00:23:46       are living to be 110 and you got Sylvester. Stallone is 62 years old. He's flogging, yoked, shredded. You know, things are getting very strange now. That's why guys are smart. They're just knock up 18 year old girls when they want to get, you know, girls would definitely give you the better genetics. The real question though is do you, do you get anything other than, you know, like hair, color, eye color, personality, do you get learned experiences and is it better off to have a parent with a lot of experiences? Are those experiences transfer through DNA because they didn't use to think it was. They used to think that ideas were only they were native to the person who had the idea, but now they're starting to think that memes can actually be transferred through genetics and that useless traits. Even like racism, racism can be transferred through genetics and it kind of makes sense because there's a lot of things that we have inside our genetics and our instincts that are basically ancient learned things like for like for instances do named Rupert sheldrake.

Speaker 4:          00:24:53       Rupert sheldrake is this evolutionary biologists dude, and he pointed out that children that live in New York City, they don't have dreams about like muggers or car accidents. They have nightmares about monsters, about scary monsters and the reason they have nightmares about scary monsters is because back in our heads, somewhere deep in our DNA, we remember back when we were like monkeys when we were these little apes hanging around and trees and you're running away from big cats and that, that shit is always in our head because that is the number one thing that, what was that fed off of, uh, off chimps and apes is his big cats. Big Cats are constantly killing monkeys and chimps and apes. And that's like when they find like old human beings, like, you know, the, the, you know, evolutionary versions of human beings, subhuman, humanoids, they find all their skeletons, like a lot of them have like big fucking cat bites, big markings.

Speaker 4:          00:25:53       So that's like, that's like some memory that we have ingrained in our, in our genetics, you know, whoever the fuck we are. It's very possible that if you're 18 years old and you know, you have, you fuck a chicken, she's 18 year both retarded. You gotTa, you gotTa have a dumb ass kid, you know, I mean that might be, it might not just be, you know, your hair color and your eye color and how tall you're going to be. It might be your actual experiences and your human potential. Second. Yeah, maybe. Yeah, yeah. Maybe if you're a loser, like if you're a fucking drunk, if you get hammered and you're fucked up and your life is in the toilet and you know, you bang some chick because you know, on the rebound and her old boyfriend used to beat her and you shoot a load in her. Maybe a kid would be just like really fucking dumb and prone to make terrible mistakes. You know, I mean maybe you can get past it, but maybe his inclination like maybe maybe we start off

Speaker 7:          00:26:44       in a certain place in life, not just based on the economic situation that our parents are in and you know, who the people we grow up with and what our agenda. Maybe it's maybe it's our, our, our position starts out based on what the parents were thinking and doing when they fucked and conceived you like maybe if that's the lowest point in their life, you not even because of the way they raised you, they can take you away and raise you in an orphanage somewhere totally different, but your potential is limited by the circumstances in which you were conceived. You think that's possible? Maybe. I don't think we have any idea. So I think anything's possible, you know, but it's very obvious that there's a bunch of different types of humans. There's like super powerful, super successful, super smart humans and there's really fucking dumb people because the percentage of your brain being used, you know, I think people use more brain than other people and I think it's such a small percentage, but even that, you know, maybe that's the real way to become a superhero.

Speaker 7:          00:27:50       Find out how to use a 100 percent of your brain. But it's bullshit. I have heard that. That's bullshit that we don't use it. Yeah. I mean when they look it up and it shows the. Yeah. But that, that's not what that part is for. You know, I think that that whole, you know, human beings only used 10 percent of their brain. I think that's a myth. Well, they don't know exactly what every part of the brain is for. It's like they're still like, it's like, you know, it's like charting out the bottom of the sea. There's a lot of shit they still haven't figured out yet. Let's see if any, you motherfuckers are smarter than us and have answers to all these things that we're talking about. It is weird when you see like a human brain on TV and you're just like, that's somebody that's a person to person. It's crazy. It doesn't make any sense. It's nuts. Just twitter is blowing the fuck up. Ladies and gentle. No, he's about twitter around. I spoke twitter on twitter, backslash Joe Rogan. Oh, it did

Speaker 6:          00:28:44       retired

Speaker 7:          00:28:45       shit. Fix that. No. Who Cares? You know,

Speaker 6:          00:28:48       I'm talking about question.

Speaker 7:          00:28:56       She watched a scanner darkly. Yeah. You know what, man? A scanner darkly is something that I bought a long ass time ago. I got it on DVD and I just have never gotten around to watching it. I tried to watch it. I stopped anti Chris. Why? Why did you stop? I remember it just wasn't that interesting to hear that shit. Chris motherfuckers said it wasn't interesting. You're recommending it and his. He saying it's whack. Canneries. Canneries is tough. Action. Is there ever been a guy that more universally panned as an actor but more incredibly successful? There's no. I mean he like it. He, he blows them off the fucking charts slipped by every time. Oh, here's something that I needed to take a. They actually found. I had a article this month

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       that there was a roadhouse video game in the being made a few years ago, but the company went bankrupt.

Speaker 4:          00:29:49       Roadhouse video game, the Patrick swayze. That's the greatest bad movie ever. It's right up there with showgirls. If you haven't seen roadhouse, I don't know what the fuck is wrong with you. If you haven't seen showgirls, drop this chat and and either download it or go to the video store and do something. You got to watch showgirls. Showgirls was awesome. Just a quintessential movie where the people who are doing the movie where were just gapped out of their fucking minds on cocaine and they made a terrible movie. That makes no sense and it's so bad that it's good. It's perfect. It's just one of those movies that's just perfectly crosses over into parody to the point where you could watch it over and over and over again. Right. I've only seen it twice. Showgirls was awesome, but showgirls and roadhouse or both, basically the same movie, both movies where it's like they got people that were just full of themselves enough and just underestimating the intelligence of viewers enough and just hack enough and just, you know, they just follow the dumbest formula lines possible and the difference between roadhouse and showgirls. Doe is a roadhouse seems to be raw stupidity on its own. Whereas showgirls is the most obvious cocaine movie of all time because it's just so dumb. Like you had to be on coke. They think that that was a good movie. Like if you. If you made that move and you weren't on coke, you would watch the dailies. You'd be like, what? The fuck we going, what are we doing? What is this moving? But if you're on call you're like, yeah, it's fucking awesome. Coming into the line.

Speaker 4:          00:31:27       And what was your,

Speaker 3:          00:31:29       what's your bit. I'll tell you escalator, which one has something to do with like, would you even be able to see it yet? Because you know, the human brain hasn't seen it yet.

Speaker 4:          00:31:40       Oh No, it was my theory about, about how we believe that everything around us is everything through his. Right. And I talk about farts and what I say is that if someone farted and you didn't have a nose, you'd have no idea if something was.

Speaker 3:          00:31:54       Oh No, no. I'm talking about something you used to say while ago, something like kind of you were kind of saying like how cars are. Would you even be able to see it? Uh, uh, because our brain hasn't seen it yet. Like the tiger

Speaker 4:          00:32:07       or something like that. Would that added on the tiger bit was if a tiger was running at you, would you be able to even watch that? Because I think you bring, just start

Speaker 3:          00:32:13       producing cyclist pyramids or something. They used to have a thing where you talked about like a, would they even be able to see it because their brains never seen it before. And so, um,

Speaker 4:          00:32:23       I think so man, that's on my act. That's um, I think you're thinking of there's a part in the movie the secret where those retards claim that or was it, what the bleep do we know? I think it was like looking at, like they said, the Indians couldn't recognize the Bolus, but if I see it, it was not my act now, my, my actors, the, the part about how if we didn't have a nose and you smell a Fart, and this is for the people that are watching this, this is the idea is that we don't have any idea if there's more around us all the time that we can't sense. And it's very possible that there is. And what I say is the fourth theory and the theory is if someone farted and you couldn't smell it, you'd have no idea that there's something around you.

Speaker 4:          00:33:02       It's totally completely invisible. But if someone farts you fucking smell it. But if you didn't have a nose, you'd be just sitting in someone's stench. How do we not know that there aren't an infinite amount of things that we just can't detect and that smell, even though we can attack this, it's for biological reasons. You know, you smell gas, you know it's dangerous for you. You smell fire, get away. There's a reason why we have a sense of smell. It's good for us, but what if we didn't? If we didn't, it would be an invisible thing and it's just our imagination that limits the possibilities of how many other invisible things there are around us all the time that we can't detect. There's all sorts of animals like worms. You take your hand and he rolled over or above a where they have no idea they're.

Speaker 4:          00:33:45       They have no idea. It's very possible that if that exists in nature, that there's also some shit like that with human beings. It's very possible that we're constantly like the idea of dimensions. Dimensions might be dimensions of perception. We just might not have the ability to perceive all these other things that are around us all the time. I mean, that could be like bad energy, like you go into a house, I mean people, many people have told stories or if you go into a house where people have been murdered and they could feel it, I could feel fucked up energy in the house. Like that all might be real shit. You know, like we don't have a name for it and we're not good at detecting it and you know, we, we call it a sense or a feeling that might be real energy that you're detecting. We're just not evolved enough to the point where we can really tune into it yet.

Speaker 7:          00:34:31       Why is it that we like our smuggler and farts but not somebody else's fired. My farts are delicious. Do you think it's just like, oh no. Do you think we would enjoy it if we made herself, you know, like if you forced yourself to smell my heart and enjoy it, like make yourself into it. You'd have to be one of those sick dudes that wax off to Fart porn. You know, because there's dudes that do that. There's dudes, there's dudes that like that that's real. But I've never heard of anybody who likes their buddies fartsy. That's weird though. Crazy. Meanwhile, I enjoy my own farm. I love my phone. Everybody does. If you're in your car and you feel a hot one and a blast, you when you do this. He stopped smoking. When I'm in the shower, I cut my hand around my ass.

Speaker 7:          00:35:15       I call it the Donald Duck because it makes it donald duck noise when you. And when I fart and it doesn't smell, I'm always disappointed by far nothing. It's worse. Yeah. But like if somebody else farts like on a plane and you're like, oh you mother Fucker, I can't believe you did that, then we should love it. You know? And it smells the same. It's not like your farts smell different than mine. What? Well, with our farts I think we get a little reward. Like, Oh, you're getting all this bad stuff out of your body. But with other people's farts it's like, oh, you stinky, fuck. You know, it's not the same reward. Is there any other smells that do that? I don't like to smell my shit. I don't like that. I tell you that I don't like that when I take a nasty dump on, Oh, get me out of that room.

Speaker 7:          00:35:57       I don't want to go back in. Like I would blow my nose or something like that and go to get some totally different. Oh, what the fuck? That was my shit. Yeah. I don't like it, but I do. That's funny man. You do like if you have ever had to shit outside Iraq to take a ship in the woods, that's the worst because there's no water. I think it's just just steamy, stinky fucking dump on dirt. Yeah. The smells horrible. Nobody ever liked. It's like sitting there sniffing their, their pile of Shit and getting all happy about it. It makes no sense. It doesn't make any sense. It's like what is, what is the evolutionary reason for that was the reason. It's probably like the cure of aids somewhere in that something that researchers are going to research on farts. Lily, you think, okay, what do you think about all these dudes?

Speaker 7:          00:36:37       And there's a bunch of scientists online like um, uh, what, what does that, there's just one guy that's at the head of the cause, uh, Peter Duesberg and they're all saying that HIV does not cause aids and that HIV is a very weak virus and that the only reason why HIV exists in the systems of these people that are, have aids is because their immune system is so compromised that it can even kill off HIV. Well, I think it's really weird that most of the people, it seems like that have aids are drug users and gaze. So they're going to have a. d has something to do with the immune system, but then you get fucking, what's his name? The basketball player that had fake aides. That's the other thing is that people test negative after a while, like in the, they're the Richard he goes into and then it goes into, in, into a dormant stage, mean magic Johnson has aids and now he's doing like mattress commercial, you know, like crazy.

Speaker 7:          00:37:31       Why didn't you have a mattress? Commercials. He didn't get a lot of money on AIDS medicine. Yeah, I think, I don't know man, I guess. I mean they probably pay him millions of dollars. Do any commercial. He's still got a good name. How much mattresses though are you going to sell it as? Payback? What have you, how many? Like how many more of these basketball players, all these dudes who you know are out there just fucking banging chicks left and right. They must be freaking out about this tiger woods shit. Who's target? What? Shit. We'll throw a monkey wrench into your endorsement deals and if you're like a Michael Jordan type of dude, like that's where those guys make them the most, the bulk of their cash as in endorsements, you know, that's why this is so dangerous to tiger woods. It's not the tiger woods can't go out there and still kick your ass and golf and say fuck you. I can do whatever I want. He can, but he can't because the endorsements is where he gets all his cash. We'll look at letterman. Same thing. It's like blown up this year. Two thousand and nine cents. No, it doesn't suck. It's what I was talking about before. I think what we're sensing, what we're seeing in celebrities is mirrored, is going to be mirrored as human beings.

Speaker 4:          00:38:36       We're seeing more access to information. We're seeing less secrets. I think it's a trend. I think it's. It's a. it's a trend because I think that's eventually what the human race is going to come to. It's going to come to a point in time where there was not going to be any secrets and that's a good thing. There's going to be full information disclosed from you to me and everything, and what it is is the convergence of all human beings. That's what's gonna. That's what's going to start to ignite the convergence amongst all human beings. There's going to be full access to information. I know everything in your head. You know everything in my head. It's pretty weird, man. It's pretty fucking crazy and that's where it's going. It's going through technology and this is what the Internet about is what twitter is about. This with this huge stream, trout is about, this is what all the shit is about.

Speaker 4:          00:39:18       It's about a convergence of human beings like human beings are eventually merging into one thing. I mean, that's the, the whole ancient line and eastern mysticism and each eastern religion is, you know, that we are all one. We are, you know, we are one consciousness, like the bill Hicks Joke, uh, experiencing itself subjectively. You know, that's the, the, the Timothy leary ideology, the ideology of all the, all the psychedelic heads, all the people that you know, they really got into like heavy duty psychedelic trucks is that it's this one thing and that we can't recognize that we're one thing because we have ego and we have survival and we have all these things, but that our technology and the technology forcing us to evolve that the access to information that technology provides eventually will cause human beings all human beings to converge and literally be like one consciousness.

Speaker 4:          00:40:06       If I know all your thoughts, I know all your information and we have an access to it, an interface that's much less crew than what we have now with typing and with researching or watching documentaries, what if it's like an instant access, a human neuro transplant, something that allows all of us to link up our minds together. That's not that outside of the realm of possibility. That to me seems just as likely as the ability to send a picture through the Internet on your phone. That's just. That's just as fucking crazy that you can send video through the air and you could watch a youtube video on your iphone. You're like, what the fuck? I mean, it's just coming through the air and you put the headphones on and it's in stereo like wax that's going through the fucking. Scott is just as likely that human beings are eventually going to come to some sort of a, some sort of a technological invention, something that we're going to come to something that allows all human beings to interface together.

Speaker 4:          00:41:01       It might be through this thing. It might be something you put on and everybody else that has it all links in together or it might've actually become something that you put in your body or it might be something they broadcast through the fucking air that links people together. I can't, I just can't wait till it gets cheaper to be able to like upgrade your body parts. Like I want to have better items because I want night vision. I want to have fucking twitter. I want. I knew about that woman that they made her a new bladder. Yeah. They might have a bladder out of her. They took her on bladder. They scrape the cells together since the group. Yeah, they grew up. So

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       I don't know if the stem cells, stem cells, but they, I know they grew a new bladder for her and a fucking petri dish and then install it in their body. That's crazy.

Speaker 1:          00:41:42       You know, a bladder just to kind of a bag for pis. But that's, that's going to happen with other shit too. Man.

Speaker 3:          00:41:48       I transplants are crazy too though. That's amazing. You like imagine a Jessica. Uh, my friends, uh, uh, uncle died and they donated their eyes and how help somebody see that canal street and they got a letter just to let you know your, your uncle's eyes were donated to so-and-so person who can now see and they get, send them a whole letter. So you can imagine somebody you know who's dead now, but their eyeballs are still being used. That's incredible. That's like a nightmare. And that's like a horror movie, right? Like, well, I heard about. So her, I was thinking I was listening to the art bell show about some lady who donated her. Uh, she, she got a liver from someone and the operation and right immediately after the operation she started having cravings for what? Of those duties are you serious? That's fucked up craving. She never had before. And then she found out,

Speaker 1:          00:42:37       dude, like really like to eat this certain type of thing.

Speaker 3:          00:42:40       First trench. I wonder if you got a but transplant if you'd like that person's farts. If you'd like your own farts still, if you got somebody else's book,

Speaker 1:          00:42:51       people might ask the weirdest questions. Dawkins 20. Look, this bill Hicks, the comedian, how are they the same guy? What the fuck kind of question is, uh, what, what does that mean? That doesn't mean anything. That's another. How are they the same guy? There's one guy, he's. How are they? The same guy. What Alex Jones is built here because this is people believe Alex Jones believes I met Bill Hicks. I'm friends with Alex Jones. They're not same guy.

Speaker 3:          00:43:20       Retarded that these people cannot be serious. Just has to be a joke. It's an Internet meme, right? If they're being. If you guys are being serious about that, you guys are fucking retarded.

Speaker 1:          00:43:31       Yeah. That's pretty. So. Alright, let's go some questions here. Magic Johnson's bought the cure for aids. Yeah. Magic Johnson. Great South Park. Episode two was more about that. The cure for years. No better south park episode than the one where the, uh, the gay dude had a horror off with Paris shelter up. I remember watching that going. How do they get away with this? You don't pass on circumstances, but you can pass on the psychic ability to create them. Alright. Alright. Christine and they. Liz, how do you know that? Do you really know that? Are you just saying maybe, maybe that's what's happening, but you don't know the psychic ability to create them. Have you ever met anybody that says that they're a channeler or says that they're savvy? That isn't a fucking retard. Have you ever met anyone?

Speaker 3:          00:44:29       I don't believe any of that. Every time they do it like fucking scam

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       artists to me. I've never met one person that says they're a psychic or says they can channel that isn't retarded. They're all retarded, but then it's almost like, do you have to be retarded to be able to do that? Like maybe you have to be like, like some somewhat of a person that can look like you're. You're so socially inept. You're so clueless as to how other people perceive you, that you can achieve certain frequencies that other people can't. Is that possible? Anything?

Speaker 1:          00:45:00       Can I get Alex Jones on opiod? Anthony? I don't think so, man. I don't think that's a good idea. I saw a little jimmy little. Jimmy did the Jesse Ventura. I don't think we'd like that. Alex Jones is not the kind of guy you're supposed to like argue with like that. You're supposed to enjoy his company and ask them questions. And then we started talking about new world order, black helicopters, legend gentleman. I see them outside of my window every night you tell me I'm crazy, but I see black helicopters outside my window. So what is going on? You don't argue with that dude. You go damn man, motherfucking black helicopters that's supposed to do. And that's supposed to like. And I think if, if I was in the room with Jesse Ventura, I'm certain I would have handled it different than Jimmy did, but Jimmy's one of those dudes were Jim Norton, fantastic comedian, funniest guy in radio without a doubt by far.

Speaker 1:          00:45:50       He, he's one of those dudes that when he, um, you know, when he's in the face of someone who's like a bully, he doesn't like that shit. He doesn't stand up to that shit. Well, and he feels like that Jesse has this slow burn in his eyes and the Imo navy seal and all that shit and that you're supposed to listen to them because of that. And Jim Norton just ain't buying that and that's why Jimmy just shut them down and clowned him. That's just what he does. He's just, he's not good at people being bullies. A respect that

Speaker 1:          00:46:22       people that meditate have large frontal lobe cortex is studies. Show says Pete Shreds. I wonder. That's very possible, right? It's very possible that it changes the way your brain works. I mean, if you lift weights, you know it changes the way your muscles. Look. If you, if you exercise your mind in certain ways, if this doesn't make that happen, Brian is going to smoke marijuana live right here on ustream. Thank God it's all legal. Supposedly. That's the only thing Obama's done. He said he would do stuff on after we'd rediculus alright, what else? What else? Party people. Let's go to the Rogan board and read some of the questions that you find people have. What is my opinion on freewill? Your blog talks about how we're all living through different circumstances, which is very true, but it seems. Do you know what the power of free will, which kind of sucks. No. Know I go, I start about freewill. I

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       think about free will and a couple of different ways. I think it's very possible that you know you are shaping your own destiny and that you know, you can, you know, choose your path and you can, you know, go through this life and you know, and make something of yourself and you know, the fact that you did it by yourself and you have through freewill. It's all good. I think that's very possible, but I think it's all pos. It's also possible that life itself is a gigantic mathematical algorithm that all life itself is like a gigantic mathematical equation and that it just doesn't seem like an equation because we're a part of it, but like that, everything, your personality, your biology, your circumstances, your experiences, they're all set up in line to put you in a very specific position to move forward in a very specific way to interface with all the other.

Speaker 4:          00:48:23       Very specific things that are around you, all the other very specific people, very specific events and that the idea is that what the idea of free will is sort of a misnomer. Like you have instincts and you have experiences that guide you into a certain way, like say if you, uh, you know, he drank poison, you almost died and it was terrible and he didn't know it was poison. Well, you'll be much more careful next time and you won't drink poison. The idea that that circumstance that you've experienced as lead you taught in a very specific way and that you are experiences literally are set up as a part of a mathematical equation and that it's all to lead this entire human race, which is really just one organism, one gigantic super organism to lead this entire human race into a specific place for a very specific purpose.

Speaker 4:          00:49:14       That's possible. You know, I don't like the thinking. You know, when your ego has any control whatsoever over your mind. Your ego wants you to think that no, you know, I am in control of my own, my life. I have done what I've done and I'm proud of all that I've done because it's my own accomplishments, but really it might be you're following a program. It really might be. We're all a part of this gigantic program that's, you know, and that all this, you know, ego justification, ego gratification, sex and love and fun and happiness and all these things are really just like numbers and equations and like the little, the powerful number that you get from love forces you to, you know, to be in love and have children and to create more people and to be good to those people and those people create more good people and that, these, these rewards are all in fact set up as a part of an equation to move the human race into one specific place that everyone is working together all over the world and we just don't realize it.

Speaker 4:          00:50:16       We're beings. Yeah, we're bs. I mean like when, I mean we don't know how bees communicate. We don't know what, what sort of a culture bees have, but we know that they don't have books. They can't their past. They can't study their history. I mean how conscious, how aware are they in? Are they just going through the motions because that's how they're programmed and if, if that's the case, if that's the case with wolves and bears and every other animal that sort of goes through these natural motions to achieve a specific result, maybe that's what we're doing. Maybe we're just doing it and it's way more complicated because what we're doing is we're actually changing our environment. We're changing the world. We're creating computers and creating technology and we're involved. We're the only animal on the planet that's involved in this symbiotic relationship with another life form and that other life form is technology.

Speaker 4:          00:51:03       I mean if you don't classify life as something that has a heartbeat and something that bleeds, but if you classify life as something that evolves and changes and grows and something that is like inexorably linked to human beings, technology is just like a virus. Technology is just like something, some sort of a bacteria that's in your system that you can't get out of. Well, you know, like you have to have a lot of healthy bacteria in your body all the time and that that's like you have a symbiotic relationship with this healthy bacteria and it keeps you alive. It actually fights off other bacteria. I mean, that's what probiotics are. That's what acidophilus says. You're taking in a live culture that will be your, your warriors, and they will fight off bad bacteria. Well, it's very possible that that's what technology is. The technology is a life force that we are interfaced with and we are.

Speaker 4:          00:51:50       We have a symbiotic relationship with this other thing. And we needed to keep us alive. We needed to keep the power on, you know, to keep, to keep us warm in cold climates to, you know, to make sure your car gets you to work, you know, to make sure that the airbag goes off to save your life and all this shit is designed to help us. But in turn we keep it going. We look at old cars on the side of the road that have broken down and dead and those things are just like dead bodies, you know, cars that are old that stay alive, that's just like, wow, that's fucking cool. That's just like seeing an old man at the gym with big muscles like, Holy Shit, you know, I mean literally like technology and things that we create, we are helping those things evolve. We are helping those things evolve with our materialism, with our obsession with technology. We are trying to always constantly get the newer, better cooler shit and in doing that and then supply that, we are forcing people to work in that industry and continue to evolve technology mean it's very possible that it's all one fucking big thing.

Speaker 2:          00:52:56       So that's my opinion on that.

Speaker 4:          00:53:00       What I get for Christmas. Your mother's pussy. Oh,

Speaker 2:          00:53:07       what's my opinion of. Oh, this is too tripper. Some people just get way too. DMT On me.

Speaker 4:          00:53:14       Stream is the extreme. Hippies are weird to me. This dude's question. This is NPO. Sharman. What is your opinion of the non ordinary reality access DMT and

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       other NCO substances? In Theo gins are, um, I think the literal translation is something that connects you to God but a psychedelic drugs. Do you feel there is much to learn from this version of reality? How can it be applied to ordinary reality? That's the real problem with any psychedelic drugs, whether you're doing Salvia or doing dmt or smoking weed. It's like, what are you bringing any of that back? Is it enhancing your life? Do you think? Anything enhances your law? I don't know that question. To me it seems like he, he, he wrote it in the garage with his car running.

Speaker 1:          00:54:05       What do you think? What's my take on Charlie Sheen? Charlie Sheen is a dude who's friends with Alex. Joe like me, but he's not laughing. He, um, he is a nine slash 11 conspiracy buff. He's an actor. He knows every data that you know, he might have just met. He's an actor after the tough action man. I mean, I know a couple of actors that are pretty cool, but not that many. Most of them are really annoying. Somebody said it busted the actors, like Comedians, but when. No punchline, they always want to talk, ain't got shit. They're not giving you anything back. At least like with Joey Diaz is talking like you're going to be laughing and you're going to enjoy it. You want them to talk, but after it's just talk, you know, actors always have the answers to like if you're talking to actors, very rarely does an actor want to admit that they don't know why something is this or something.

Speaker 1:          00:55:01       Is that why, you know, they always have opinions, like really poorly thought out opinions, whether it's on politics or a war or anything. Have you recently, uh, an followed somebody on twitter because they just tweeted too much? I just unfollowed them. No, I hardly ever unfollow someone you all the time I bought a block. People if they just have arguments with me and just sort of boring, but I followed the dumbest motherfuckers. I followed so many dumb people. I didn't want to tell you what they're doing. I don't want to tell you who they are because some of them, some of them were just fantastic. Fantastic. With their terrible tweet.

Speaker 5:          00:55:41       I just unfollowed Kevin Smith the other day because she spent, he literally spent two hours replying to every single person that has rode them and like the last two months, and you did it because it blogs up your. It was all him and had no one else. I'm like, Oh, next page. Are you serious? She liked him though. I do like them, but that's bullshit. Dude. Needs to learn how to fucking use twitter. Well, how you're supposed to do if you don't reply direct messages, but to all those people, if you're gonna, if you're gonna replace all our time. We don't care what this answer this question is that if you do, yeah, the messages, the problem with the direct messages that you kept, everybody

Speaker 1:          00:56:16       else can see it in. One of the cool things about Kevin Smith is like before following Kevin and you get to see everybody saw Kevin Smith responded to you this video type shit. Then and reply go, okay, here's our next person from twitter to do because it just ruins everything else. I hate it. I met Kevin Smith and he's cool as fuck. Fuck that. I'll never unfollow him. He could put pages of Shit on my twitter and I will. I will keep it going to. I love. I love the database. That's just uncalled for. What do I think of Ben Stein Calling Ron? Paul? Antisemitic. I don't think about it at all. It's hilarious. There's two old queens. I would love to see Ben Stein. Ron Paul suck at each of those costs. I would pay a thousand dollars for that. But you seemed brutal yet. No, I have that on video too.

Speaker 1:          00:57:07       It's something that watched it and it's. It's, it's that whole part with Ron Pawn and ever since I've seen it, I always look at him and he looks like an old queen to me now. Ever since then. Yeah. Just how he handled that. He hit it like, I don't know. Well, he super religious so it's possible possibly getting right. If you're really intelligent and yet super religious. I always gotta go, all right. What's going on? What are you doing belong guys? We don't. It's weird. Yeah, there's something wrong. Either money or gay. If you're really intelligent and you're, you're really buying into, and this is not saying you know that there's no god. It's not saying that there's no this not something else. I'm the first one to say that I don't know. I have no idea, but I'm also the first one to say that you don't know either and anybody that pays any attention to religion or follows religion at all and it looks at the history of religion, knows that it's a.

Speaker 4:          00:57:54       it's a disjointed mess and nobody even knows the origins of all this stuff and nobody knows how much people altered the words and what we do know about it is that the. Even the Bible itself, the oldest version of the Bible, they don't even used the Dead Sea Scrolls. That's the oldest version of the Bible by far. They don't even. They don't even use that when you think that's like the best one, wouldn't it as like the purest version of it? Now we're still busy using the new testament. The New Testament was created by Constantine and a bunch of bishops. They piled it together and the Old Testament. Well, the Old Testament, the real, real version of it was written in ancient Hebrew and to this day in 2009, they only know three out of four words in ancient Hebrew, that's 20, 25 percent of the words, they don't know what the fuck it means.

Speaker 4:          00:58:37       And on top of that letters also double those numbers back then because there, there was no numbers. So the letter a was also like the number one, like if you did it that way. So there was a numerical value to words that was completely lost when they translated, translated, uh, ancient Hebrew to Latin and then to Greek. So like, like the word love and the word God, they have the same numerical value. So we don't even really knowing what the fuck they were saying. So No, I'm not saying that there is no god, that there's not something else. But what I'm saying is the follow current religion as it's practiced and preached today, it's ridiculous. It's ridiculous. So if Ron Paul's really into that,

Speaker 1:          00:59:16       come on, big old queen. What is doing? Let's Ron Paul, big old queen. Like if he just came out and said he's a big old queen, I would still vote for him, man. I think he's a bad motherfucker. I would like to see if somebody's really tried to get in there and shake up the system and change the way you know, the, the, the world is run and you know, keep us out of other countries and to demolish the irs and get rid of the CIA. And that'd be fascinating. Fascinating to see if someone can actually do that and not get killed. I don't think that

Speaker 2:          00:59:49       good if it Kendall. Yeah. I got Kendall, what?

Speaker 7:          00:59:55       Just wondering. I just got one of those Sony readers for Christmas, um, when it's cool because Google bought all these books and so I don't know if you can do this with a candle or not, but with this one way you can just go to google and download all these free books on it. And they have your itch issue of Kung Fu magazine or whatever. Karate magazine. Black though. Oh, that I was in. Yeah. They have that. And so that's the Sony reader. You can go and get that. So you can get any book basically for free. Well not any book, but any other ones. I'm Google has like a ton of books, but they're all like old school at a print books. I think it has to be out, man. I got the kindle and I couldn't get any hunter s thompson books. One book that he wrote that was for sale, but they didn't have a great shark. It didn't have to google.com backslash books and see if they have it there and he was downloaded. I don't know if it works on kindle though. Probably a kindle reader. PDF files. It does, but when it reads pdf files doesn't let you enlarge the text, which was annoying. Oh, you can do that on the sign.

Speaker 1:          01:00:51       Fucking shit. I got the wrong one.

Speaker 7:          01:00:54       No, I don't still better probably. And our question earlier when we were talking,

Speaker 1:          01:00:58       what about kitting poker? Can these bots on poker sites? Poker? Jay who was a John Carlos Alvarado was on the rubbing board, says poker sites catch bots with the program that can see if you click the same pixel every time you make a move. Something that's impossible to do by a human. Oh,

Speaker 7:          01:01:21       I guess why you have the program go over a couple of pixels. Yeah, I agree. Time change the program, right?

Speaker 1:          01:01:28       Figured it out already to thing sucks. How has the shit. I just thought it was excellent.

Speaker 1:          01:01:37       Did I really forget everything I learned during the taekwondo days? I still remember some type of window stuff. Some stuff talking window is effective. Like you see commonly leaves and a lot of taekwondo. He used a lot of turn side kicks in front lake side kicks and frontline roundhouse kicks where it doesn't switch the legs. That's. There's a lot of power and that stuff. It's just, it's not complete in taekwondo needs other things. It needs more time wrestling. When did you get to and all that stuff, but it helps. There's some stuff in it that's different. You know, the, the style of a like karate that Machida uses the leaping in and leaping out. Nobody knew that that would work before. No, because no one was ever good at it. That was good at other stuff as well and I think that's sort of the same thing with kindly and window

Speaker 6:          01:02:22       Du du Du du Du du Du.

Speaker 1:          01:02:29       These questions all suck. Twitter suck cock on my website guys. A bunch of gay ass motherfuckers. Stupid ass questions.

Speaker 6:          01:02:46       Um

Speaker 1:          01:02:47       Oh. Same questions with the same people. Circumcised. Here's a good question. What'd you get your kids circumcised in this day and age? Because most guys in America or cut? No. I am not going to. If I have a boy and his new baby, we don't know what it is yet. We'll find out soon and if it's a boy, I'm going to let them have a big elephant.

Speaker 7:          01:03:09       You're discussed and care what? My baby's Dick looks like. What the fuck? He wants a lot of video of it. No, no. I mean I was thinking of that just the other day. So funny that this person asked us to. Dick comes out a certain way of senior time before knows. And that covers it like a turtle neck. Do you. Have you ever seen porn? Just felt bad for the poor guy. A fucking creep Dick? Yeah. Bad circumstance. Have you talked to girls about this? I don't give a character like, oh my God. He had an unsophisticated stick. It was so disgusting. That chance to talk to girls that have sucked uncircumcised dicks and they don't care. It's a little different. Yeah. Yeah. Any girl that would care doesn't count. It's good. It keep constantly from my boy. I'm picky. It doesn't like a uncircumcised Dick.

Speaker 7:          01:03:55       And what's your why? Why do you just think it's just ridiculous. It's totally unnecessary and it feels better. Supposedly we need. I don't need help coming faster and faster. It actually feels better. It's more sensitive. It's not whether you come from you. Actually it's more enjoyment. Silly, man. I'm not getting. My kids are ridiculous. This is ridiculous. I hate and find so weird. I'm so glad. I'm just like something. I think every day I'm like, thank you dad for. Oh my God. I know there's websites out there were dudes. Try to regrow their skin. It's a long process to research them. Size or Dick, they stretch it out. They have like little things. I get attachment that you clip onto the tip of your daycare. It gets more. They get more infections in, in, in like dirt inside there and it's like if you have a deck, that's my answer to that. Clean your fucking Dick. Look. How hard is it to wash your Dick? I hate dirty dip. People should not have. I have

Speaker 1:          01:04:57       no circumcised nerc circumcisions, but if you're a cleanli personally, you shouldn't be like my boy bullbait. He will have an uncircumcised Dick got down. Have you ever. We think we already talked about that. What have you ever ate out a girl that had really long, prissy works? Yeah, I like that. There's one way I could stretch probably that far. It was just, it was like chewing gum

Speaker 7:          01:05:17       when you always in your mouth. Do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

Speaker 7:          01:05:28       See, this is to. All these questions are like old. It's like a hour ago on now. Hayden. Funny his twitter, his twitter is the bomb diggity. What is it? The mark, Hayden that I think he changed it to the dumb mark gating. I'm starting to think it's not real. What do you mean? Who chose the name of it? I don't know. No, there's someone changed the name of it. Whoever's doing it. Then why would they do that? Man, we got a thing going on. Motherfuckers been good on. Do you think are lifetime microchips has something to do with dogs where it scan and send access? Yeah, I think that's going to happen. Yeah. I think. I think it's very possible that there's going to be some sort of a microchip thing where human beings are going to be scanned into a database. The real problem is there's just so many fucking people.

Speaker 7:          01:06:14       There's so many goddamn people. How you do that? How do you keep track of it? Who's going to watch it like people used to say, Oh man, what if your phones are bugged? Who's who's bugging these phones in workers, government workers. How many people they watch him are there. Is there one person for every person out there they just circling on you because they know you sell pot, like, come on man. How many fucking people are out there that that could actually be monitoring people's phones? Well now they have the technology where they can just sit there and record every single phone call and it transcribes it like dragon speak, but times 50 technology and it pretty much looks for keywords like money drug, you know?

Speaker 1:          01:06:54       Yeah, that's. That makes sense. I've heard that before. There's things like video programs, like what's it called, Predator or something like that. They had one, there was a. We go through the Internet and search for like al Qaeda for search for terrorists, search for certain specific key words,

Speaker 1:          01:07:13       peak oil versus science. You know what man, I think they're going to figure out some other shit besides oil. I think it makes sense. I think you know, there's a lot of stuff they could do with agriculture. There's a lot of stuff they can do with hydrogen. There's a lot of stuff. It's just we could have come up with something else. It's just we got bamboozled into going the way the oil because it was easy and cheap and it was already in place and we stayed with oil, but I don't. I don't think society is going to crumble because we run out of oil. I think we'll come up with something just as good.

Speaker 7:          01:07:42       She heard those meal, a mini coopers in the cold. They electric ones in cold weather and only gets half the power. How big is that? That's ridiculous because they're only good for like 100 miles as it is. So in cold weather it goes 50 slash 50 miles, if that makes sense. Because your batteries more dead in cold weather piece. Shit. Yeah, but the amount of buying that car, that's an expensive car imagined. You know what we top gear. Did you know that show? Top gear. BBC. Awesome show. They took one of those Prius's and electric car and they drove it around a track with a presence. A hybrid, right. They drove it around the track with an m three and all the [inaudible] had to do was keep up with the Prius. That's all it had to do. The preschool and went full blast or on the track and the [inaudible] obviously much, much faster car. All I gotta do is keep up. The Prius got 13 miles to the gallon and the [inaudible] got 19, so when the Prius drives hard, it's just as much of a piece of shit as you know, any other car. It's like, it's nonsense. It's like it's fake being green and it apparently it's much more toxic to the environment to create a Prius as to how it worked is Prius is uh, only uh, our electric under 25 miles an hour or something like that for stop and go traffic. It's, it's, it's running off battery over that. Just a normal car.

Speaker 1:          01:09:05       That makes sense. Yeah. And over that as a normal car, it's terrible. It's just a small, shitty, terrible God damn piece of shit.

Speaker 6:          01:09:15       Right.

Speaker 1:          01:09:22       That was bb Jones with the circumcision question.

Speaker 7:          01:09:26       It's so weird he asked that because I was just thinking that. The good question, man, that's a good question. That's a weird thing with people. I didn't really worry about what your kids did. Did it start? Well? I just think everyday how, how thankful I am. You're so silly. If I had your little Dick, I would cry myself to sleep or somebody close to this on the board

Speaker 1:          01:09:49       today about being Indian men and that, uh, there's like some, what is it? Sixty percent of Indian men? Um, I don't know if this is a true statistic. Somebody I've been rocked, posted it. So tell you what a grant assault. Sixty percent of Indian men cannot use a standard condom. One in five condoms fall off during intercourse. So this is from the BBC. Is it true? I don't know. We're going to go to it. Damn the BBC.

Speaker 7:          01:10:17       Yeah. If you go to India, data fucks and women. Wow. It really is.

Speaker 1:          01:10:24       Wow. It's true. Have more than a thousand men in India has concluded that condoms are made according to international sizes are too large for the majority of Indian men. That's crazy. That's sad. As a magnum user, I feel for you bitch.

Speaker 1:          01:10:44       Wow. Scientists even check their sample check to see if their sample was representative of India as a whole in terms of class religion in urban and rural dwellers. So even like the peasants, you know, even the slaves in India have a little dicks, so sad. Least the peasants of the like the lower class America are generally thought to have the biggest dicks. Right? Slaves. Back in the day when they had slaves, those guys almost had monster horse decks. Yeah. How many white women do think flux letters back then? Ten tons of. Do you think they did when their husbands stop fucking right, snuck in and just got some Alabama black snake.

Speaker 1:          01:11:25       How many white women do you think had babies with slips back then? I think that had. There was a lot of dead babies. Really? Yeah. There was a lot of white guys who would fuck the black slaves. That was very common and have babies with their black slaves up. Fuck. That must have been. How weird must that have been to the. The guy who was the father would fuck the slave, have a baby with a slave. The slave would have his baby and he would see this half white baby and he would just leave the half white baby with the slaves and let them take care of it like you wouldn't even bring it into. Has this kid just because of a race thing that must be. That must have been fucking enough. Talk about like haunting your conscience. How Weird is witch trials? You know, the old school widths trouser where they would like way witches or it still goes on today in Africa and Africa, they still have a huge problem with people accusing people of being switched video where they caught him on fire and they're just sitting there on five beating with sticks and kick it.

Speaker 1:          01:12:21       This is real recent. There was a, um, here, I'll put it on twitter. I wrote a blog article about it and it's one of the worst videos that in Hong Kong girl snorting yourself to death. Yeah. There's the video that you could see this Hong Kong girl, she snorts this gigantic line of Ketamine. Ketamine is a fucking cat tranquilizer and a lot of crazy kids are doing this and she snorted this gigantic line for a video and then one of dying the videos available online along with the store,

Speaker 2:          01:12:51       trying to find the.

Speaker 1:          01:12:53       Well, I'll put that article online that I, um, that I wrote about.

Speaker 2:          01:12:59       I think it was called

Speaker 1:          01:13:01       humanity gone haywire. I think that was the, uh, that was the name of the article, but it was all about how, how funny it is that there's this real problem they have right now.

Speaker 2:          01:13:19       I don't know when that was from. There's no search option. My blog archives are k through that. There's no search option. It's weird. I have a search shopping. This is terrible. Let's for tell you dude,

Speaker 1:          01:13:40       look at that. My fucking website is.

Speaker 2:          01:13:44       This is way better. Yeah, Google is way better for searching then

Speaker 1:          01:13:51       my own website, [inaudible] website. My website is being redesigned right now. People. You've been saying it for eight years. It has been designed for eight years, so I'm sure.

Speaker 2:          01:14:06       Dammit, let me find out the twitter. This bitch

Speaker 1:          01:14:19       guys.

Speaker 2:          01:14:20       Ah, ah, ah, ah. Here's the battery.

Speaker 1:          01:14:40       All right. I put it, I've just pushed, put it up on twitter if you bored and you want to read this thing about witchcraft, watch the video. It's really creepy. You know, a funny thing about witchcraft in America, like everybody knows about the Salem witch trials. Well, what I read, um, the biggest connection they have to what happened during them, why everybody thought they were being possessed and there's witchcraft going on was that there was a late frost and that the wheat got frozen and when it sought out, apparently when that happens, when there's a late frost and freezes and thaws out, it grows a certain fungus on it. And this certain fungus is called Ercot in Ercot has, it's like really similar or identical rather chemically to lsd. So when they would take this bread that they would make from this wheat that had grown this fungus on it, these people would fucking trip their balls off.

Speaker 1:          01:15:39       They would have these crazy, horrifying bad acid trip. So they literally fund. They were under a spell, which totally makes sense and they just started burning bitches. And women always want to say that it's you. Oh, you know, men were, you know, back then, you know, men were, uh, the, the spell that a woman would cast upon her upon him with her beauty was just to perplexing and the men couldn't deal with the fact that women had all those powers that killed him. Eh, come on, guys have been raping chicks forever. He tell him, got to stop back. Then there's, this is not that much. This not that perplexing. It's guys want to shoot a, they shoot a load, you know, a guy's wants you to load the jerk off. They don't want to shoot a load anymore, you know, they're not going to start burying people because they want to fuck them.

Speaker 1:          01:16:24       I don't believe that. I think it's a much more likely scenario that this fungus grew on this wheat because they had already taken soil samples. And so they had known from there, you know, whatever climatological studies that they use to figure out how cold it was during a specific time. There was a late frost, there was some evidence that there was a late frost and then this, um, or God was also found somehow or another during this time period. So I think it's just speculation, but it's much more educated speculation and the idea that the men were under the spell of these women and they decided to kill him. That doesn't make any sense. I think they probably did the acid from the wheat and then killed the cons. That's probably what it was, you know, that's why I was a witch trial. Those were probably the context in the town.

Speaker 4:          01:17:10       If I would just, let's cut these major bitches. Yeah. Like these chicks are bad energy. Like you'd be around. I'm like, fucking pitches given me bad vibes, you know, because you're all acid now and they probably just started lighting them on fire. I'm like, fuck it, let's kill this bitch. Why are we having are around. Imagine if that's really. The witch trials were out. Maybe like afterwards, people were so nice. They killed all the cuts off.

Speaker 2:          01:17:30       Imagine that.

Speaker 4:          01:17:34       Is that possible ladies and gentlemen? Does that make sense? Little Fuck is calling me during my God damn podcast, Tait Fletcher. No, my fucking ustream. Bitch. How dare you.

Speaker 2:          01:17:46       All right, let's go back to the question. So a gentleman.

Speaker 4:          01:17:50       Have I ever seen the northern lights in Iceland? No, I've never seen him in purpose. So. Awesome. I've seen some shit online though. It looks incredible. It's like the sky becomes like a desktop screensaver. I've been seeing way more falling stars lately. Like it's almost getting to the point where it's kind of ridiculous. Yeah, it's maybe a deer coming once a week. Maybe. I see it at least one. Could you imagine if we know for me it does. It doesn't seem like it's real, like you said and talk about like asteroid impacts over the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs 65 million years ago or the one that killed you know everything before that. The mass extinction before that 250 million years ago, or the one that ended the Ice Age 10,500 years ago when there's all this speculation about asteroids, but the real reality is there are gigantic, hundreds of thousands of gigantic rocks in space that can fuck us up and every now and then one comes crashing down.

Speaker 4:          01:18:45       It's happened many, many, many, many, many times over the history of the life of the earth. It's happened so many times and it could easily happen today. It could easily happen tomorrow. You can easily one that comes from behind the sun and we can't see it until it's too late and there, you know, and just fucks the whole world up. That's so possible. We don't like to think it's possible because it's never happened, but I always like to see. I always say it's like an ant hill, that human life is like an ant hill. Like if you, um, are an aunt and you're living in an ant hill, you were probably born in that ant hill and that hill is all you've ever known. How long to answer live? Like a week, couple of weeks, something like that, so say like the sand hill has been around for six months.

Speaker 4:          01:19:30       That's been through the generations after generations, long dead have made this ant hill and then you know your toilet away and your little ant hill and one day some kid is walking through the field and he sees that anthill. It just boom, boom. She starts to stomp on it for no fucking reason, and then you're ant hills crushed out of nowhere. You never thought it was going to happen. It's always been fine. Everything's always been cool. At the end hill, if you had a take a gas and you had to make a gamble, you would say, yeah, yeah, this and that was always going to be here. It's always been here. Always will be here. Bam. Some kid just stomped the fuck out of it. That can happen to people that can happen to Earth. Katrina, Katrina, how about Detroit?

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       Really? Somebody who has a magnifying glass on it. Detroit, I watched Anthony Bordain had a show about Michigan the other night and he was there. They were driving through horrible, horrible, terrible. You ever wants that Anthony Bourdain show? Good show. It makes you hungry. He goes to the food show. No reservations. Fucking shows. It makes me so hungry.

Speaker 1:          01:20:32       Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo says there's an asteroid with the possibility of hitting earth in 20, 29. Yeah, there's. There's a bunch of them out there that they don't know about. They come to the problem as the skies too. God Damn big. I mean it's covering everywhere. Shit's coming from the North Pole and the South Pole and you never know where something's coming from. I mean it could be coming from anywhere in. You never know. There could be something heading our way that we haven't picked up on could be behind something. We don't see it. Gravity distorts our view of things as well. Like if you look at the sun, you can literally look at it. Some of the telescope you could see things behind the sun because of the distortion and the gravity of the sun because it's so massive. I don't understand how that works, but that apparently is how, how it works, and so there's occasionally things that could be hiding behind something that's coming straight at us. We don't even fucking see it until it's too late, you know, there's just not enough human beings out there monitoring the sky to really accurately predict, you know, oh, we're, we are 100 percent clear skies. Nothing's gonna hit us for the next 200 years. They don't know that. They can't say that. There's always something that comes real close. They just barely misses us. And they go, Whoa, Holy Shit. I was three miles long and it missed us by 200,000 miles. That's not much, you know.

Speaker 1:          01:21:56       Okay. Let's go to some questions. You dirty bitches,

Speaker 1:          01:22:01       Nabisco in 2012. So as the antichrist. Oh No. So some people think you're set of 2012 movie. Yes. Horrendously bad. Really bad. Not even worth even a special effects sucked. Oh really? They were there. I mean, it was awesome. Things were happening, but it didn't look real. Like the car is, was a limo and jumping things and landing fine. Driving off and it looked a little talk, computer generated and silly. It's like every five seconds, the fucking, you know, the car was almost going off the cliff but barely made it. You know, it's like, come on, stop. Stop with your nonsense. This guy here, easy dog down below seven says, yeah, I believe in God. How did everything originate? But how did God start? Oh, that's an easy question to answer it. God.

Speaker 6:          01:23:05       Um,

Speaker 4:          01:23:05       were you there? The real problem is believing in anything. You know, that's, that's the real problem. The real problem is believing in anything. It's not believing in God. I believe in God. The real problems, believing in anything you don't know. We don't know. God created a really good video game and we're all in it. That's possible that this is God's version of the sims and this is on somebodies phone. Wait, we're not even like a good video game. We're just like a fucking cell phone video shoot that people play when they kill time, waiting in line at the right rear break break earlier. It's God. The real problem with believing in God is that believing in God just makes people feel better. You know, it's not saying that God doesn't exist. It's very possible that God exists, but you you don't have the information no one does.

Speaker 4:          01:23:53       You can decide that you have that information because it empowers you. You can decide that there's a god because it makes you feel more comfortable or makes you feel more. You know that there's a future to this world and after you die, there's something waiting for you and that gives you confidence and that gives you that it can empower you, and that works for a lot of people. I know a lot of fighters who are very religious and that that belief in God that actually empowers them and it can. It can work that way, but it really is just a tool. It's just a psychological tool that they're using to empower them and it doesn't necessarily help them. What helps them is the state of mind that they put themselves in by believing in God. You know, it's a really kind of a funny thing.

Speaker 4:          01:24:34       It's a catch 22. Believing in God can empower you. The ideas of Christianity are very empowering ideas, the ideas that you know, that you know, love your man as if he sees you and you know, do unto others as if you would have them do unto yourself and you know, turn the other cheek and don't be violent and be helping. Be Loving and be humble and worship God and the idea of God. What God is. God is life and energy and the whole universe and that you treat the whole process as it's one gigantic fantastic thing and that in, in, in going to a religious service and in, in practicing, you know any sort of a religion in, in, in like sticking to a certain ethic that what you're doing is committing to positive energy and if you commit to that positive energy and then those positive thoughts and positive way of thinking, that's empowering and that really will help you.

Speaker 4:          01:25:26       And if you really do believe that you have a destiny and that God has carved out this destiny for you, that's an empowering thing. That shit, that shit will absolutely make you better things you say, that's evidence of God. That's evidence that Jesus, well maybe, but more likely it's evidence that you've put yourself in the exact proper state of mind to achieve things by thinking positive and having positive energy and being a loving Christian by doing all those things. You've put the good energy out there and you've given yourself confidence because you're doing the right thing and you've given yourself a strong belief in yourself because you're following the right path and in doing that,

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       that's very empowering. That's how God is real. That's how religion is real, but what it what it really all is at the heart of it is you tuning in to the the correct frequency of the universe with the least amount of resistance, the least amount of Latin amount of resistance from you. The least amount of negative thinking, the least amount of meaning. Like when I was a kid, I'd get in arguments all the time with everybody about anything and really I was just a knucklehead. I was just a dumb fuck, but I didn't realize that by doing that, by creating all this drama in my life like I was, it was just distracting the shit out of me and it was keeping me from doing things that I wanted to do. He was keeping me from being happy and comfortable and friendly and it was keeping me from like I was constantly in a state of causing trouble and causing drama and creating all these obstacles in my own life and I didn't realize it at the time and I always thought of people that were religious.

Speaker 4:          01:26:58       Like I just thought, well there's got to be a lot of power in that because like I was afraid of a dude who was a religious who was on one of the USAA taekwondo teens back when I was fighting. There was this dude, I think his name was Bobby Clayton and I think that's his name, but he wasn't the best guy, but he was crazy religious and that used to scare the shit out of me. This dude used to read the Bible every day and this dude was like super, super, super religious and he really believed that himself and I was, you know, not very religious and even though I was doing really well in these tournaments and I was, you know, beating a lot of really good guys. There was something about this dude and his religion that scared me, like on paper, he shouldn't have been the scariest guy to me, but he was, for whatever reason, because this dude was really religious, so for you know, that that belief that he had in himself, that the belief in his faith and his [inaudible], all that shit was, is empowering to him and I recognized that it was empowering to him that he was really legit about it.

Speaker 4:          01:27:56       And then he was his super religious behavior. Like he was never. He never swore he didn't drink, he was friendly to everyone. He was like really, really, really dedicated and that was, that made me nervous. I think religion is empowering. Brian has been a huge advocate of scientology ever since he moved to Ohio. Right.

Speaker 7:          01:28:19       Tell us about your experiences with scientology. They're sluts, they're easy, they're real easy to sleep with. Just have to trick them in a lot of positive energy and stuff like that. Yeah, and you just take their money and they sleep with you. That's great. Do you hear that? Is the scientology how a thing with fucking are a lot of fun? I all it is. No, you don't definitely married or anything and then I don't think so. Yeah. When any new religion comes around, you can be. I'm not saying he's lying. I think if I had to pick one religion, like if you had to do it, I'd

Speaker 4:          01:28:57       be Buddhist. Yeah, that seems like the one that makes

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       the most sense. But the problem with being a Buddhist is you've got to hang around with a bunch of fucking. He's a bunch of people who are pretending to be Buddhists, you know? Yeah. They always smelly feet. Yeah. It looks like it's like the idea of hippies. It's all good on paper, but the real problem with hippies is, you know, they don't want to work. They're fucking lazy and stupid. A lot of them. And then, you know, it's like the stereotypes of the pot smoking, Lazy, you know, a Ne'er do wells. Like that's, that's like accurate. And a lot of ways that's the real problem with hippies. You know, what's Buddhist women look like? I don't think I've ever seen a bit of school. I'm doing good. Vegetarians are really. Did they have like about heads orange robes, gentleman. I gotta take a shit again so I can't believe this. We aid sausage subs this local place down the street. They're a little bit too strong, too powerful. Five hundred 24 viewers.

Do you get ever get tired of all these stupid people asking you about drugs? I think he just, you just get tired of stupid people. They don't care about drugs now. He doesn't get tenure.

Speaker 6:          01:31:06       What else?

No. You should not take dmt. If you're asking joe on a twitter, if you're a are alien or aliens among us. Yes. They're Asian based. It all aliens are Asians. Yeah. I think all aliens or Asian or some kind of breed of Asian because they were just technology than us. Regular white people were more caveman. They're more alien. See, let's go back to your Rogan and board forums dot Joe Rogan.net. There's a whole thread with people asking questions on there. Also, I can. Can you views you stream over the iphone?

Speaker 5:          01:33:37       right? Band, you seem to be pretty much up on technology. What's the single piece of technology or equipment that would be available to the public you're most excited about in 2010? I think a lot of people who know me, I'm excited for the new apple, a tablet, like an oversized iphone because I net, net books are so popular right now and I just find that that's just going to be what's next. After net books and iphones back just took another tremendous shit. Oh, sorry. Brian said, my shit stinks, which we know what to expect, man. Isn't that bad? Alright, I'll, I'll try to enjoy to like it. All right. Oh, that's great. You're faking it. Yeah. I'm thinking it. Why? I shouldn't have to fake it. I shouldn't just act like it's mine. Yeah. Why don't you do that? Okay. It's mine. No, it doesn't work. It's so stupid. It should work. Yeah. You can trick yourself. What do we got here?

Speaker 2:          01:34:46       Uh,

Speaker 5:          01:34:49       thank you. Twitter turned out on this page. Would you see that cloud just blew through the wrong. Her refresh

Speaker 2:          01:35:03       shows your stomach or you burke? We just added this Italian place down the street. Tremendous sausage and pepper sub. You get to like an east coast sausage and pepper. Seven la. Was it called Cavalry Camera Ready? Something like that.

Speaker 1:          01:35:23       Good fellows. Posters were in there. Okay. Questions. Do you ripe wipe from the front to back or back to front? That's a good question. I never thought about that. I'm a dude and I'm wiping my ass. Not Like Regina. So I guess front to back. Do you stand up? Yes. Yeah, totally. Do you know, were rare. Most people sit down when they white, they can't get the job by now. I don't understand it. Also. Uh, you said you always piece sitting there. That's kind of how dare you. I dare you. I'll tell you something about my toilet though, that you probably didn't want to know, but you probably already know if you follow me on twitter, you can. First of all, you can't flush those flushable wipes. That's bullshit. They say you can flush those things. Yeah, they'll disappear, but they're going to clog up your fucking toilet.

Speaker 1:          01:36:08       It was those flushable wipes that you get. You got to use just 12. You've been getting the dis. The flushable kind of disposable kind. Yeah, but they're not, they're not flushing because I love first month of using those. I thought they were all flushable and then I saw that little picture on the back. I'm like, clogged the shit out of your toilet. But mine. Mine got clogged up and they had to come and fucking clean it out. Rest you had crossed a lot of money. But the big thing is that I have fucking plant growing in my toilet. Yeah. You saw that Shit, right? It was ridiculous. It was a gigantic tree that was growing in my toilet. They found roots and they pulled it out and I put it up on twitter. I think a lot of people have seen it. I'm sure. I'll see if I can find it. I'll throw the link back up. Maybe something like flicker page. I mean it was so ridiculous. I mean it was so ridiculous that I looked at it and I was like, how the fuck was that growing inside my toilet? But I guess it was the water. You need to start updating your flicker. Right?

Speaker 2:          01:37:10       My photo stream. I must've had it after. I know I had it on twit pic. Right. Maybe that's where it was. Yeah. These are my. No in Colorado photos. Yeah. Something here. Put it up. Let me start again.

Speaker 1:          01:37:28       Twitter. Twitter is twitter. Twitter.

Speaker 2:          01:37:29       Yeah. Music and hearing now, why not? That's against the law. What is it? You're streaming music.

Speaker 1:          01:37:43       If I do this and I have music playing in the background, we can't do it. Could be arrested.

Speaker 2:          01:37:47       Come on. Really? This isn't a topic, you know, that's the problem with using all these different goddamn programs. Why frog or I don't know what the other one is or how the other one works so fucked up when find picture back then your twitter. You find it for you guys.

Speaker 6:          01:38:08       Toilet tree.

Speaker 2:          01:38:18       I don't even know the fucking photo is. No, I have to go to iphone photo and I apologize this. Ladies and gentlemen, this is not very entertaining, isn't it? You don't even give a fuck. You don't give a fuck. When you see the picture though, the pictures are so ridiculous to. This goddamn thing was actually grown inside my toilet bowl. It seems like it's not going to be worth the wages. Google toilet tree, Joe Rogan. It'll be out there in zinc. So yeah, fairness here. This motherfucker can mean. Come on man. Look at that fucking thing. That shit's ridiculous. I've got to show you guys. This shit is goes. It looks like. I'm like, I was mumbling so it doesn't even look real. It looks completely fake. So now go back to flicker, upload their shit. This is, it's going to be hard for this picture to live up to the hype of fiddling through my fucking computer. Just trying to get this picture of you guys, but once you get the picture I think you'll. You'll appreciate what the fuck I'm saying because it's so ridiculous. This thing was growing in my God damn toilet.

Speaker 6:          01:40:03       Weird.

Speaker 2:          01:40:06       What the fuck? Where is it? Explored it.

Speaker 6:          01:40:25       It's uploading right

Speaker 2:          01:40:34       soon as it uploads. I'll take the length. My Internet is so weak. Why have you done this yet? I'm do. Just make a call. I'm a procrastinator. Clearly make a phone call. That's all you have to do. I think I will even have a beer. What? Sort of six slash one. So I'll do it tomorrow. I'm going to do it and gentlemen, a lot of people

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       talk about upgrading the Internet. I'm going to and do it. I'm going to do it for you guys

Speaker 3:          01:40:58       because once you do that, we could have separate cans. You know, gonna have two cans, we got a third cam. If we need to show something else, we have a third came. Just be your desktop. So instead of having to upload all these photos, you could just show what's on your desktop.

Speaker 2:          01:41:14       Why would I do that? It's easier. That's getting whatever shop. Okay. Here's the photo. All sizes. Big Size Papi.

Speaker 3:          01:41:32       Which bathroom is that when you hear Jesus? Yeah. What do you think about the mayweather pacman situation? I think they're genius in minus 38. Really? How twitter tweet? Tiny your eye. Why isn't it just do it for your parents. Your mark

Speaker 2:          01:42:03       tweet? Because it's a WAC program. She their twitter programs. Why doesn't even shrink your urls or thought that that would be a business?

Speaker 1:          01:42:16       Yeah, it's gotten big. We're getting a tiny url business. What are you talking about? Oh, making people website names. Really small. Yeah. Who the fuck would ever thought there would be a market for that?

Speaker 3:          01:42:26       One of the websites, I can't remember. I don't think it's tiny url, but it's one of them like almost got bought the other day for like a couple million dollars and that's all it is. Is that url short shorten. That's hilarious.

Speaker 2:          01:42:40       All right. I put it up your fuckers. That's another one that was grown.

Speaker 1:          01:42:53       All right. Sorry for the long delay. That was ridiculous. It wasn't even that interesting but it is kinda interesting. I, I put the picture up. You can go see the picture. It's on my twitter. What's next? After a weekly Rogan podcast and the book. What's the next project? There are no next projects. This is about, it isn't about all. We're going to do a weekly podcast. We're doing a show for Sony was going to be called a l, F, m, a o, but now we might have to call it something different.

Speaker 3:          01:43:23       Yeah, because I was trying to do it for like two years and now there's a band called

Speaker 1:          01:43:28       mail or something like that. Their clothes will come up with a name for it, but it's basically a interviewing comedians about the creative process. And, uh, we're also enter in the middle of a coming up with another show that uh, it's comedy related to I can't talk about, but it should be fun. That and just more shows, more comedy, more good stuff. Is fear factor

Speaker 7:          01:43:52       returning anytime? Oh, it's not. I know there was a rumor that. No. Oh yeah, there was a rumor for a while they were going to try to bring fear factor back. This fear factor when they canceled it was like, it was kinda like they could have kept going if they really want. That's a show that could come back easily, do that shit. And if you did it without me didn't have the flavor, I'm sure it would probably be great if they did. It was like Mario Lopez. No, you can't pass up on that easy money. Especially if you're working with all the same people again and stuff. I might be willing to

Speaker 1:          01:44:26       just for my kids just put money away. What's your movie coming on? Uh, October. Damn. October. Should I move to Colorado? I loved Colorado Man sideshow. Sit said should I move to it? I fucking loved it. I would still be there. I didn't mind the cold. I liked the people. I liked the sky. I like the way the fucking mountains looked. I liked the vibe. I liked everything about it. I liked it for me creatively. I liked living in Colorado, but when you have a family, you have children, you have a wife and it's not as. It's not as easy as just me being by myself. It was, it was just me by myself. I'd probably still be there. I still be on the top of that mountain, but she was not into it. It's just too creepy. When our dog got eaten, our dog had eaten by mountain line.

Speaker 1:          01:45:15       That's not like a rumor that actually happened. Dog had eaten by mountain lions and uh, she's bad driving in snow. She crashed the car, so it was a couple of different things. And then she got pregnant and the pregnancy was the biggest reason why we had to move out of Colorado. It was because we were living over 8,000 feet above sea level. It's really hot. It's like three. We are 3000 feet above boulder and it is really, really high altitude and when you're pregnant it's just brutal. It really, it's not good for you. It's unhealthy for you and for the baby. Colorado is like one of the highest states in the country that one of the top states in the country when it comes to premature births and a lot of it is because the altitude just. You don't get enough air up there. It's just, it's great for your conditioning, but it's not, not so good for from being a pregnant woman.

Speaker 1:          01:46:01       So all those factors I had to move out to Colorado, but if I could just be somewhere and live somewhere live in Colorado. Oh, in a heartbeat. If I didn't have to travel, stay in Colorado and you know, deal with snow when it comes to your fucking snowed in. No big deal. That's what it's supposed to be like. A problem with me is I travel all the time so I would leave my wife and leave the kids there. It's not the same by myself. I'd have no problem with it. I loved it. So if you are going to move somewhere and stay there, I would say yeah, Colorado's fucking bad ass. That's my favorite state. Do you think there will be a time when all handheld access will have a pipe in them? Like the Tomahawk Tomahawks where there were a pipe and an ax all in one.

Speaker 1:          01:46:45       Is that true? If that's true, the Indians were bad motherfuckers, so I think that did just went to a renaissance festival getting carried away because I mean if you think about, if it was a pipe also, listen, this is the beauty of the Internet right now. We'll google this. Did Tomahawks have pipes on? I think there might've been a couple that did, but I don't think the majority of it. I speculate. Let's find out. Okay. I just doesn't seem right. It seems like it would just make that the weapon weaker, having a hole through the middle of it. Yeah, that's true. That's a good point. Maybe it's enough. Yeah. Hype, Tomahawk.

Speaker 2:          01:47:26       That's a pipe axes.

Speaker 1:          01:47:31       The crazy crow trading post.

Speaker 2:          01:47:33       Show me a pipe backs these pipes

Speaker 1:          01:47:39       pipe historically accurate pipe axes. We have spent years researching and manufacturing the finest line of throwing Tomahawks pipe, Tomahawks belt and camp ax is available today. Did you even know there was a market for that kind of Shit? That's the beautiful thing about the Internet. Let's see what this thing looks like. I don't see the pipe part. Where's the pipe part? Hand drill for smoking. Wow. Sounds like anytime forge iron had drilled for smoking. So basically the pipe is this. You put some tobacco up in that bitch right there and you smoke right out of there

Speaker 1:          01:48:18       or do you smoke? You smoke out of there. Wow. Nick, the handle weaker in a weapon. Weaker definitely would. Right, but this seems like it's like really hard would. This one's got a metal piece through that original 1800 to 18. Twenty five believed to belong to red cloud. Wow. That's pretty dope. Red Cloud in. Didn't think it out. Dude. I think we should start smoking pipe from a fucking Tomahawk. We're going to order one of those. Come on man. What'd you the podcast? We'll smoke out of that. That's ladies and gentlemen. What? Say you on twitter? I need to order this, right? I'm going to order this. Add to basket. Listen, clerk.

Speaker 2:          01:49:01       That's added to the basket.

Speaker 1:          01:49:03       All right, I'm going to check out now. I'll check it out later because I don't want you guys to get bummed out at me. It was boring enough looking for that toilet tree coming up on two hours. Which would make this two hours. You think? Why are you getting bored anymore? No, I just think we to keep it to you have to do another video.

Speaker 2:          01:49:19       Someone doesn't think it's fun anymore. All. Let's go back.

Speaker 1:          01:49:26       Four hundred 71. Motherfuckers in here. We lost a lot of people for being really boring. Madison to I think is just about right.

Speaker 1:          01:49:34       You want them wanting more? Not less. Is that what we want? Ladies and gentlemen. Let's see. Ryan. He correct two hours. What is the. Where's the time on top left? Where they're getting light is right over here. I think after two hours also it doesn't save maybe or something. I think as people start hating this bug, it's got nothing to talk about. Boring as shit. So, so far we've answered questions. We put photos up on twitter, we've talked about some heavy subjects. Would more, do you need that? He's in gentlemen. We're all living in an alien's petri dish. Says Dawkins 20 maybe, you know as possible. Is time illusion shred for 31. Wants to know if time's an illusion. I don't think it's an illusion. I just don't think time is just one thing. You tell that the David Copperfield, everything's.

Speaker 1:          01:50:37       I think time is, you know, I mean we already know that time changes when you go fast. Like if someone's in a super fast spaceship, uh, you know, and they go at the speed of light, like time goes by much quicker on earth and it doesn't in their plane. So if they come back and they're super fast spaceship, you know, for them it's only been a year. But for us it could be like 100 years depending on how far and fast they go. So time lose in a way that I don't, I don't, I don't think it's the way we look at it. I don't think it's as cut and dry. Like, you know, this is midnight and this is 1:00. I think it's, it's much more dependent upon the state that the human beings and like the frequency of the persons in the world where the person's living, you know, that you're, you're living on earth, you know, this dimension, you know that there's the time varies throughout other dimensions and you can access those dimensions.

Speaker 1:          01:51:30       I mean if they really do come up with ships that can fly through space at closest speed of light or something, they really will be able to go to a place where they're, they're literally going forward in time. They'll have lived one year, they come back to earth and hundreds of years have gone by. That's just nutty shit. And that's real. No, I don't think we understand time enough. I think Tom is one of those things that we think we've got a grip I want. It really is, but it's probably far more complex and confusing and variable than we think

Speaker 5:          01:51:57       I didn't use to get rid of daylight savings time because I think it's bullshit that it's fucking pitch black outside and it's only 6:30. Yes, she's absolutely right. Farmers, they're all fucking thief's. What's, how dare you. But seriously, John Mellencamp hater back then it made sense because everybody was a farmer. You know, everything has to do with farmers nowadays. Why didn't they just get up earlier to get it? I don't get everything. It makes sense.

Speaker 1:          01:52:23       I think, you know, if you have a regular job, you know, sometimes it's dark out. Sometimes it's light out the fucking earth span. That's what I love about Arizona. The Arizona, they don't change their time. They're like fuck,

Speaker 5:          01:52:34       you know, it's stupid. What they need to even do it better than that. They need to like really fuck it up. Like I want it to be bright out till like nine to 10:00 at night. Don't you think? That'd be cool. Yeah. But then it would be dark

Speaker 2:          01:52:46       out until like noon here, but that's fine. No.

Speaker 3:          01:52:48       Oh, that's retarded. Retarded is that. It makes no sense. Most people would rather like to have a day. Like most people would rather have daylight when you get off work and anything.

Speaker 2:          01:53:02       I think that's silly. It's silly. I spelled twitter long while my link. I know I did. I don't think I could fix it though. I think it's too late. It is. It is what it is. No, you don't get better. What do you do that other program remember? Oh, that's right. That's this little motherfucker right here. Check so shit

Speaker 6:          01:53:35       right in the room.

Speaker 2:          01:53:42       Yeah. It's just understanding the whole thing. Why does it not show? Because it's like two lines. You know what I mean? Like if you hit the right button,

Speaker 6:          01:53:56       right? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:54:01       Put a Joe live. Yay. High fix that shit. It didn't change. Oh good. Good.

Speaker 6:          01:54:21       Mm hmm.

Speaker 2:          01:54:23       Scott is trying to be funny. Steve whizzy trying to be funny. Steve was. He says, besides Carlos, when Sia. Who are your other favorite?

Speaker 3:          01:54:33       What does make sense being silly? Goose.

Speaker 2:          01:54:38       Um, my favorite comedians though for real. All right guys. Well I look forward to seeing like Lucy Kay, uh, Dave attell. Doug Stan Hope. Definitely. Um, there's a cat williams. See Him live. I only seen him on video.

Speaker 3:          01:54:58       Catlins is on TMZ yesterday. Just got out of jail or something like that. And they, they, he got in a fight at a bar and he had a gun in his pocket.

Speaker 2:          01:55:06       Ah, like it. He's crazy. That's crazy. He's crazy. For Real. I want to meet that dude. I like his comedy. I think he's very funny. Do you ever listen to him on a grand theft auto? No. Good. Yeah. He does like the voice. Well, no, they have a comedy club and grand theft auto. I like it. If not telepathy. What's next for Human Johnny Bananas?

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       Twenty one wants to know boots for men if not telepathy. What? Snacks for human evolution. Probably a reversal if not telepathy, if we gonna I think we're in a race right now between technology and retards, between technology and caveman style living, you know, they're talking about invading Pakistan, veining, Yemen and more war and more craziness. You know, we're at a, a crossroads and I think we could either get hit by a meteor or blow ourselves up or figure out the next level, figure out what, what's going to take human beings from where we are to the next stage of existence. Which is like a real thing. I mean, I think we're really going to evolve. We're really moving towards something new, you know, I think that's what this, this frantic fucking society we live in is all about. I think we're, we're pushing and moving towards something all working together towards something and I think it's going to be technology driven, so it's one of those things. Either that's going to happen, there's going to be some sort of a technologically birthed connection that all people all of a sudden share some sort of a,

Speaker 1:          01:57:01       some sort of a convergence of all human being. It's either gonna be that or it's going to be blow ourselves up or a meteor fucks us up or yellowstone explodes and we start from scratch. You know what if, what if in the future, the first robot to get pregnant? Imagine, imagine you figured out a way to get out machines so closely tuned into human beings that you can fuck them and get them pregnant. Yeah, I think that's very possible then don't you? Anything's possible at this point. That's not that crazy. You know? I mean, they can make so many things artificially. They figured out a way to make pork in a laboratory. The actual, the meat, they can take some of the meat from, from a pig and then making a laboratory. The problem is it's not really like mushy because it doesn't exercise at all and it's not like, it's not like taught sinew, but they're trying to figure out a way to maybe electrically exercise the muscle. You could literally like just make gigantic like rooms full of meat, you know? It doesn't even have a life attached to it. If they can do that, if they can do that, why can't they? If they can figure out a way to grow meat, why can't they figure out a way to make an artificial human being

Speaker 1:          01:58:12       that's going to be just like blade runner though? They're going to be all sad and shit. Don't want to kill you. You know you have to give emotions. If you don't give them emotions, then you know they can't relate to people. They can't empathize with people and then just go on mad raping and killing sprees. Because if you make artificial people, if you make them, when they get the hard ons and shit, you know, he has a boner. Our robots imagine.

Speaker 4:          01:58:42       I mean if you make the females you make males to like for like old gay dudes, you know, dudes and what you know, like to have a robot fucked all right, but gay dudes would want some robot gay. Do you imagine if they could make a like a real live like safe. There was a guy who was your neighbor who was really creepy and he was fixated on you and he make a robot that looks exactly like you and just fuck it all day long and punch it and tie it up and shit on its head and there's nothing you can do about it. So literally next door to your fucking house. This guy's like putting that, the robot head out the window and waving to you. Look, look, I'm pissing his mouth and it's like you. But it's a fake you. And he's just fucking it up all day.

Speaker 4:          01:59:27       How disturbing with that be? There's nothing you can do about it because you have the papers on this. It's not a real human sir. And they chose the papers. Okay. I guess it's a robot. I mean, if it's a robot, right? Look, if I have a grappling dummy in my, uh, in my garage that I use in my practice, my Jujitsu, you know, and you could practice positions on it. It's like it's a, it's called the above a dummy to Gracie. You could buy it from, uh, the, the, the, the, the Gracie Academy in Torrance. They're, they, they're the ones who start selling another website. I forget what the website is, but if you look above a dummy, it's a dummy that's just designed for Jujitsu. And we filmed once playing around. Remember we're in the yard and in the garage. We were beating the shit out of it and kick it in. What if that was a real person? I mean, it's a dummy that we made, but what if it's a robot person? What if there's like a robot person that you could practice Jujitsu on? You can rape them. Who could punch him in the face? You could just beat the shit out of me. You could chop his arms off. He'd be screaming and yelling and the cops come to go, look, it's a fake person.

Speaker 3:          02:00:19       You ever been there? The laws would have to probably change that. Artificial intelligence is just the same, you know, because then I mean, yeah, because I mean a dog isn't as smart as a human, but don't. You're not going to. You're allowed to chop the dog's legs off and stuff like a robot that has artificial intelligence. It's still going to be considered artificial intelligence, I think.

Speaker 4:          02:00:39       Yeah, but do you think that they'll treat it the same way as a human being? Like the laws? It'll be like murder,

Speaker 3:          02:00:45       right? I think if it's. If it can think it's going to be considered life, but before they figured that out, there's going to be a couple of years of masturbating, extra staffing,

Speaker 4:          02:00:55       have a direct replica of you and he's gonna fuck. It's right in front of your window. It's going to blow an air heart. I look out the window. What the fuck is he doing? You looked at these fucking your head and you think about it, like, what if that was me? What if I was the duplicate and the real me was watching me get raped.

Speaker 3:          02:01:18       It's weird shit. That could be real. That could be real. That could really be a possibility. You know? What I'm surprised is that there's not technology yet where we can. I could have a program and type out shit and make it sound exactly like you. Like, you know, like your voice can do the exact levels. So like you could prank call with your mom and stuff like that. Is there should be that or it shouldn't be that. Totally.

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       Yeah. Why haven't they figured that out? It seems easy. You know, it's really ridiculous too, is that you still have to sign things. You scribble their name.

Speaker 3:          02:01:47       Yeah. This is stupid because I write taco penis. I don't even care. They don't look at it and it'll check your id. This.

Speaker 1:          02:01:54       No, no. I don't sign my credit cards. I guess if you could look at my driver's license, I scribbled my name on that and it's a similar level, but what are these fucking people that work at the target or they scribble experts can look at that scribble. I Dunno. It's just not the same guy. Sometimes I write full sentences. Honest to God. Yeah. It's ridiculous. How is that still around? Right. Something with your name and that's legally binding. If you write something with your name, you know what I mean? Like you know when I got married I had to get a marriage certificate and had to write, scribble and that's it. That's what ties you up now when you wrote void.

Speaker 3:          02:02:30       See, I wouldn't do that. I would write. This is not real and scribble because then she has a gun head. If I get a divorce I got.

Speaker 1:          02:02:39       If you could see I wrote this is not void on it. I wonder if that was enough. Valid. I don't know. Maybe. Maybe you could say it's like shit. Then I could say, well we have a. We have the documents you sign. Then you can look at and go, look what I wrote. Yeah. It says this is not real. You know, been married. Maybe just sign. I do not agree to this. I'm a gun is being held up to my hair color. They have my dog hostage. Robots will have rights after awhile, so yeah, that's a guy I watched that will smith movie ai, ai, ai. So they need to make an ai maybe like with the kid like sex. Was it? I am robot robot. That was. That was pretty good moment. That's a good movie. Everything was Mac. Remember all the robots look like Max does.

Speaker 1:          02:03:26       Gilbert. It will have a chance against those Santos. This guy's talking about UFC. This is that. When you leave you won't talk about UFC will answer one UFC question. Yes, he does. Gilbert arrivals. Dangerous. He's a really good striker, dangerous motherfucker and he knows there's a big opportunity for him. He's going to come charge and guns blazing. Don't you think it's stupid when people ask you is going to win that fight because obviously it's a fight for a reason. Meaning that there's not an obvious winner of this fight, so most of the time it's not an obvious winner, but most of the time, I mean there's a lot of the times when when everybody agrees that a certain guy going to win, I mean, it doesn't mean that you're right, but in this fight, this guy doesn't know that much about this Gilbert Ivo guy probably and wonders.

Speaker 1:          02:04:09       I think Gilbert's got a real good chance he's. He's dangerous. If he trains hard, if he's in real good shape, he's very, very dangerous. He knocks a lot of guys out his out of Gary Goodrich and pride was one of the most spectacular knockouts ever. Head kicked him. Boom. One shot, like 10 seconds of the fight and put them to sleep. He's questions that you can ask a dog to bark once for yes and two for no, and it had the same percentage of the outcome of the question in the answer that, you know what I mean? Like if you say, yeah, that going to win, someone's going to win. Right? But someone's. I'll also tell you if someone's good or not, you, you don't know if someone's going to.

Speaker 2:          02:04:45       Okay. No more sports questions.

Speaker 1:          02:04:48       Order it. I'm going to order that for the time occupied next broadcast. Hopefully if they get it too many times we will have a tomahawk pipe. I think that's a fucking awesome item. Like you need another pipe. I needed tom off [inaudible] like a motherfucker I bake, especially since it's a replica of something from a dude name. Red Cloud was fanny packs. They have. Oh, they have a sweep and we'll get that. Somebody that quilt. Oh, that's like a shoulder bag. I don't do shoulder bags. That's a God damn purse. Okay. Fanny pack is fucking manly. That's a manly shit. All right. Let's go to the Rogan board and see questions. Yeah. Why is fanny pack manly? I'll tell you why. Fanny packs and mainly because if you're wearing a fanny pack, first of all you're saying I don't give a fuck what you think about how I look.

Speaker 1:          02:05:37       You know, you just slapped in this big stupid gay thing around your waist and you're like, whatever. I have two hands free and I'm happy. I'm not trying to look good for you. I'm not trying to fuck you. I'm not trying to get you to be my friend. I like having all my shit in a bag then yeah, I'm not trying to get laid. So when people talk about, oh man hugging, you wear it for a pug. That's so gay. It's a bag that connects to my waist. This is silly. The only reason why you don't think it's good looking because women figures disgusting and women think it looks gay. So women have figured out a way to bully. Guys did not wearing it by telling us that looks gay. Why would you care what kind of a bag? Another man. Where's your. Unless he's wearing a bright pink hello kitty strap. It covers up your crotch. Yeah, it does cover up my crotch. It's right there. So if there's like a micro media that comes from outer space and could potentially hit me in the deck, it's going to hit my cell phone first or perhaps my wallet. It's right there. It's easy for travel. When I go to the airport, I unbuckled that thing, Bang, put it on my car keys on there. My cell phones now at fanny packs of the shit son

Speaker 2:          02:06:44       got here.

Speaker 1:          02:06:48       That would be cool if gay people love the smell farts. That was didn't Joe Joseph

Speaker 2:          02:06:54       for awhile.

Speaker 1:          02:06:56       This fellow says, when are you going to come to the east coast of Canada? I don't like the east coast. Can't. No, I'm just kidding. We're in Montreal last April.

Speaker 2:          02:07:04       That was fun. I'll be back. I'll definitely be back up there. All right, page two. We're going to the Rogan board right now. To answer your questions

Speaker 1:          02:07:18       thing about Jersey shore. I don't like Jersey shore watches that thought I would like it because I knew too many dudes like that growing up. To me it's like more annoying and stupid. It's fun for a couple seconds. So you fist pump, you know, but after awhile it's just, it's fake. Did this is my theory. I mean talking to my favorite. No, I think it kind of like when Hill's first came

Speaker 3:          02:07:36       out, everyone thought that was a real. Then slowly got to the point where we figured out it was a fake show that's film to look real. I think Jersey shores real way too dumb to ask. Did you know half of them are like male strippers. I had to audition like they're all in the entertainment field. It's called Jersey shore and stood the hills. You know, I bet you anything of that. Yeah, I bet you anything sounds and they all live in this house. It's really nice. Like railroad house. You know what I mean? That's the real people. It's really a genius show if you look at it that way, but I think in three years we're all going to be like knowing it's fake. Like that fight somehow is fake and everything really. There wasn't fake when I do punch that girl to face, unless that chick is like a, you know, stump woman and they fucking practice it for like 50 years. You know what I mean? If they practiced the punch a lot, you know?

Speaker 6:          02:08:29       Hm.

Speaker 3:          02:08:31       I mean you look at movies and you look at that punch, it looks real. If they filmed it like to look fake, I think they'll do got drunk and punch that bitch face.

Speaker 1:          02:08:41       Listen, someone said what? I have full blown aids or spend one year and Mark Hayden's body pick one.

Speaker 3:          02:08:49       Well I know what full blown aids you can recover from. You know, being in one year and marketing's body will probably be torture. David. I think full blown aids. If you take your vitamins, probably be okay in a couple of weeks. You spend one year in mark cadens body. Every chicken could possibly fuck, fuck unaids. You're not going to get out of these bonds and mark cadens body. You don't get aids in marketing. You don't even understand the question. No, I'm saying if you have one year in his body, you could just abuse it. Like fucking get the fuck out of there in one year. It's ridiculous. How dare you.

Speaker 2:          02:09:24       That's in this.

Speaker 1:          02:09:26       Let's end this. Alright, well a couple more questions. No, I need the fuck Outta here. I got to met. Some of these questions are really lame, but it could be that were really high and they just seem lane.

Speaker 2:          02:09:37       That's a distinct possibility, which that's more coffee right now. Um,

Speaker 1:          02:09:46       I apologize for the wack ass Internet. I really am going to fix that. Should I go 80 and t uverse or should I go? Comcast cable. Charter. Charter, Charter.

Speaker 2:          02:09:58       Wow. This guy says, I think red bands. Life is fake. How about that for our children to camp mistake. He says, your life is fake. I think you said your face is fake in his face. His screen names fake. Like he didn't even have a picture. This is di. What would happen? Well, it's fake and on. It was not fun.

Speaker 6:          02:10:21       Nope.

Speaker 1:          02:10:23       With this, this is the laziest rapist ever. Dave Broomfield@hotmail.com says, hey, Joe Rogan. Why don't you invite me to come trip with you and your isolation tank. How lazy is he? That's not how you were stalking rape. Somebody saw him. It's gonna. Take. It's gonna. You gonna have to be a little more clever than that. That's ridiculous.

Speaker 2:          02:10:43       Fuck that guy.

Speaker 1:          02:10:48       We've got a fake Brett Rogers. Hey Joe Robbie. Did you see my last fight? No. Fake Brett Rogers. I didn't. For Roger's not on twitter. Isn't gentlemen that's a fake Brett Rogers. The railroad rogers is a bad motherfucker, but that's not him. But it was really funny when the fake Brett Rogers was having an argument with a real, a warm machine that was pretty funny. War machine didn't get it. Thought it was all really happening. Brian, you stopped talking a while ago. What happened if you've given up on us?

Speaker 7:          02:11:24       Yeah. I get to the cutoff point where I'm just tired of staring at computer.

Speaker 1:          02:11:33       Well, I have an accompany in Indian head dress to go with my Tomahawk pipe. Says uh, um, use 97. 90 four. Yeah, that's a very good question. And I think yes, I think if we're gonna really get in touch with the spirit world. We're going to need full Indian attire. Anything. Yeah. We're going to need the whole thing, man. We're going to need feathers and shit. And the, you know, the correct type of. We'd kind of make sure we only smoke what the Indian. Small? Yeah.

Speaker 7:          02:12:01       Smaller condoms. Small. No, not those Indians. American Indians. That India Indians.

Speaker 1:          02:12:08       Girl Mosh pit. I watched her for a couple of seconds, but it was like one of those terrorists videos where they cut some dude's head off after awhile. I just shut it off. She, if any of these questions don't suck. So, um, I think if anything came out of this somewhere, someone right now is thinking about designing a robot where you clone your neighbor and make a robot out of it and then fuck them and rape them in front of somebody. Somebody is thinking about that. And I think if this

Speaker 7:          02:12:45       chat has done anything good for the world, it's introduced that idea at that possibility out there of making a clone of you. You're just gonna sack is we're going to be like 90 years old and they're going to make the perfect fuck robot, but we're going to be so old. We're not going to even care anymore. I'm telling you that it was. Yeah, I guess, but they'll probably have more problems than we have now. You know, we'll probably look back on these days and Oh, remember the simple times they just get on the Internet and drive to work and you have to worry about monsters and aliens and Ufo and fucking know the Hyena flu. That's killing everybody lately. You know, that's the next one. Something scary like pig food doesn't scare you. Bird flu. That doesn't scare the fucking Hyena. Flu is going to scare the shit out of, you know,

Speaker 4:          02:13:32       it's a flu that came from hyenas. Holy Shit. Yeah. From, from eating their own young. They came up with a fucking crazy new flu and it's an everyone who gets it dies everywhere. What beekeepers outfits everywhere.

Speaker 1:          02:13:48       Cat in California last week got the first h, one n, one reeling people that cat. Uh, so maybe it's going to be cats. We're gonna have to kill our cats or something like that.

Speaker 4:          02:13:59       After you have a baby, cats become just really annoying. Dogs are knowing, like shut the fuck up. But he was the best

Speaker 1:          02:14:05       babies. Rural dogs or cats. My cats started pissing in my office right after my child was born. New plans. Parent little con. So obvious what you wanted to be a little bitch. A couple more questions here. Let's go to the rug and boards if we've got a good question there. Do you ever get mad? Like in anything? Actually pushed her off to the point where urban smash a, I get that I get upset, but it has to be pretty fucking a bad situation. Me that upset. I'm pretty rational when it comes to most things. I have A.

Speaker 4:          02:14:38       I mean everyone has the ability to freak out over something. It's just whether or not you choose to let yourself get there. You know, just gotTa. Make sure. I think the most important thing about not getting mad as manage your biology, you got to treat your biology like it's a bank account. And if you have, you know, if you're in debt, you know you owe it something. If you know your overdrafted you, you owe yourself an expenditure of energy. Yeah. Especially if you have a certain type of body. If you have a muscular body, if you have a person is in engaged in athletics or whole life, you have a Bot. If it's used to exerting a lot of energy when you owe it to that body, you have to like you have a debt to pay and if you don't pay that debt, you're gonna, you're gonna have a problem where you're going to have too much energy that's stored up and built in, not blown out and it's going to come out and unusual ways.

Speaker 4:          02:15:24       Look in traffic or at work or whatever. It'll you'll, you'll start screaming and freaking out about something he really didn't need to and really it's all just about managing your biology, managing your thoughts. It's very important to have some downtime where you can sit alone by yourself and just think, that's very, very important for me. The isolation tank does that, like times 100, that's my favorite, but sometimes even just sitting on the couch and just by myself, just thinking, you know, you can call it meditation, you can call it whatever the fuck you want. Just spending time to organize your thoughts and put your mind in a certain place. Put your body in a certain place with exercise, with yoga, with nutrition, all that Shit's important. You've got to manage your biology and when you manage your biology, it makes managing your mind much, much easier.

Speaker 4:          02:16:10       Managing your mind, managing a biology. That's the key to not getting upset at things. You fucking faggots. What the best artists created from the starving artist. It seems that this is a good question. It seems the best art is created from the starving artists being wealthy. Do you feel it hurts your ability to create art comedy, or do you believe that not having to worry about your financial wellbeing allows you more time to be creative? That's a very good question. I think a lot of times people are much more ambitious when they're starving. They have much more energy. They have much more a dedication towards something, but that doesn't mean that you can't have a lot of dedication towards something when you become successful. It all depends on what was your motivation in the first place. If your motivation in the first place was recognition and you know, adulation and then you become famous and then you get that, then you have no motivation to keep going, but if your motivation is the actual art itself is creating new things, then I think you can be more free as you become successful because you're in a position where you don't have to worry about money anymore, so you have one less thing to think about and you're ambitious in the sense of being creative instead of concentrating on money.

Speaker 4:          02:17:18       Your mind is not geared on that. Your mind is weird on the art. That's how I like to think that I am and when I'm at my best, that is where I'm at. That's my mind frame. You know? That's my my point of references that I think about the, the creation of the art itself. That's when I'm at my best. If I think about money, I think about like how much is this going to pay me and is this worth this? It's not the same motivation, so it's. You don't get the same results. It's not the same passion to it, but the passion has got to be real. It's gotta be my comedy the way in my head, my motivation is all about whether or not people enjoy it. I don't want to do anything that people don't enjoy. I want to make sure that everything that I'm creating, I'm creating it so other people get enjoyment out of it and that's the reward that you get for that one.

Speaker 4:          02:18:01       Yeah, as long as you're concentrating on that, you do no wrong. As long as you have the dynamic in the relationship between you and the audience, as long as you respect that, and as long as your relationship to the creativity is all based on just producing more stuff, that's good that people enjoy as long as you're doing it for that reason, I don't think you have to worry about, you know, money robbing you of your enthusiasm, but if you were just in it for the money and just in it for the adulation, yeah, you become successful and then all of a sudden like, you're not gonna wanna do it anymore. You're not going to be. You're not going to be enthusiastic about it anymore. Hyena flew equal super aids. That's what I'm talking about.

Speaker 4:          02:18:46       We're planning on doing December 20, first 2012. Um, no. I'm going to stay. If it's really what people's. Are you going to go to the pyramids, man? If it's really what some people think it is, this convergence is technological convergence. We're all human beings will interface with each other where someone creates a time machine where some huge technological breakthrough happens. If that's, that's what some people think. December 20, first 2012 or whatever that shit's called Hadron collider and that's about the time it's gonna. If that's the case, then it doesn't matter where you are. Right? And they should be amongst friends. Could done nearby. Maybe Brian and I will do a ustream that, but yeah. Should we commit to a 24 hour? Let's commit to. Right now. We're going to commit to a huge dream for December, December

Speaker 1:          02:19:28       20, first 2012, December 20th, 2012 commit so that as the 21st turns over, we'll do it at midnight. Show at night. We will start at 8:00 eastern, so that's 11:00 eastern. I don't care what time it is in England. You don't count. Okay. That's not December 20. First 2012. It's all based on fucking America. Okay. Because the Mayans and the Americans were basically on the same calendar sort of right now. Kind of really. I think a different timeline resource in teaching eatsa is the same as Miami. Okay. It's just a little bit below that. I'm either way, December 20th, 2012, 2012. Brian and I are committing right now to a use dream. We're going to do it.

Speaker 1:          02:20:07       Feel strong about that. Nothing's going to happen. Maybe. Maybe not. It's going to happen. That is a possibility. You know, I think people let them know that something's going to happen. We have a friend that likes to believe in Ufos and psychics and con chem trails and anything, anything wacky. This, this dude is just jumps on board. You know, and I think it's just as possible that nothing's going to happen as more possible. It is possible to. Something might happen on the day because everybody's thinking something's going to happen on that day, right. If it's some dude sitting somewhere with some bombs that made me think that I think, you know, the idea that we're going to force something to happen by really concentrating it as, you know, as a point of focus. This one point. Yeah. But that's what everyone thought was going to happen in 2000. That is true. But everybody was waiting for the clocks to break in. 2,000 was a very specific things falling from the sky. Stop working, man. I stayed home. I remember I stayed home. That was one of the first, um, first years where I didn't do a new year's show. All right. I think I probably was worried.

Speaker 3:          02:21:14       It's so weird is that everyone was really freaked out about that. And then we had all this built up stress because of it. And then just shortly after nine slash 11, it's like, then we finally got the release, all the stress, like the world's ending. I just remember being really stressed out thinking something was going to happen. It seems like right after 9:11. Alright, let's quit.

Speaker 1:          02:21:39       Dr Brain's most easily give up. Brian doesn't. It doesn't take vitamins. Yeah. Two hours. Two hours and 20 minutes.

Speaker 3:          02:21:48       I ate a bag of carrots today. I have a juicer now. Oh Man.

Speaker 1:          02:21:52       Well we've dropped down to 425 years. But that says to me is at least 100 motherfuckers thought we were boring as shit. Yeah. So I think that how Harry is my. But from one to 10, how dare you sir. How dare you. Big Too to thug. Um, from one to 10 my but three, three or four. I really could use shaving and trimming. I was listening to an old Howard stern broadcasts where they were fined and he was fine for talking about shaving is, but you know, you don't realize how crazy those fucking regular radio shows are like what you can and can't do until you hear something like that. But it was inspiring and I was thinking about Truman, my own bonaire. But uh, it could definitely help.

Speaker 1:          02:22:37       Solar flares are not in our control. And that's the thing to worry about, says wrapped or 94, wrapped in 94 things that solar flares are you going to do us in for possible? Man, nobody fucking gay. Make Brian cleaned my room for the next year. Stream. That's just my other desk is covered the shit I, it's a desk, but I really use it as a place to just leave shit. I'm a slob and have problems as adrenaline. Du Du, Du, Du, du Du. What bullshit resolutions will you say you will keep and won't know? I don't make resolutions.

Speaker 3:          02:23:14       She's not a girl because I'm not a fucking girl. All right. And uh, if I wanted to fix something about myself, I would start.

Speaker 1:          02:23:20       No, I wouldn't wait. I always say I'm going to work out more this year. I'm going to talk, I'll get my shit together. But for the most part I put out as much energy as I want to put out. I focus on things as much, as much as I can while still enjoying them, you know, always dancing around obsession. That's very important to me. Whether it's with comedy or anything else. And with games, with anything in my life, I always have to dance around becoming obsessed with things. So for me it's just just enjoy, just try to be balanced and try to consciously, you know, just try to have a good time to be positive when I get obsessed with things, whether it's about Jujitsu or comedy or playing games like pool or video games, I get crazy about things and I don't like that feeling. I don't get obsessed with things. Brian, you get obsessed with jerking off that? No. Hey, due to how much porn do you have?

Speaker 3:          02:24:12       I get obsessed with Internet now for sure was like I constantly want more information about everything and it just branches off more and more and more and make. I'll be looking at that why, what, how applesauce is made, but then I need to know about how the apples are grown, you know, and just keeps on going and going and going. Yeah. It wasn't that way when you were a kid, right? No, not at all. I fucking hated reading and I didn't want to learn anything. I just wanted to play video games and around on the grass. Funny how different when you get older, your your id

Speaker 1:          02:24:42       idea of information changes. Because when I was a kid, information always med school and Shit, you have to learn meant boring. Meant suck. Right now. They were all connected together, but then when it's no longer a requirement, then yeah, you'd be, you find out what you're actually interested in. You pursue those things.

Speaker 6:          02:25:01       No, no,

Speaker 1:          02:25:07       probably just fucking fall asleep on me. Believe that shit the fuck. Alright. My twitter friends. I think uh, we're going to answer one more question. He's fake snoring like the goddamn three stooges stuff. Is that mo?

Speaker 4:          02:25:24       Are you doing mo? We got to know her way. It might've been curling maybe, right?

Speaker 6:          02:25:34       Uh,

Speaker 4:          02:25:38       2000, 2012. Something very subtle may happen that we don't realize for awhile.

Speaker 8:          02:25:44       Good Dude. Dude, go smoke your aol discs and get off the internet. Something subtle is happening right now.

Speaker 4:          02:25:58       Recognized for awhile. That's not what 2012 sources be. If that's what happens, then 2012 was bullshit. One hundred percent bullshit. If the, if December 20, first 2012 rolls around and we just go,

Speaker 4:          02:26:10       nothing, I don't feel anything, I don't feel a thing, then it's bullshit. One hundred percent. It's not like, Oh man, no, there's a change. You just not going to realize it for awhile. No, it's supposed to be Bam. It's supposed to be open a door. Here's a new thing. You know, I mean if the Internet turned on, like if there was a day that the internet turned on, we all look back and say, Whoa, December 10th, 2019 93. That's when the Internet turned on in the world changed forever. If there was like a recognized date, first of all, that would be way more important than fucking Columbus Day. How about that? How about we studied Columbus Day and that dude never even landed in America, right? Who was in the Bahamas or raping and murdering people and Shit. You know, and then Columbus Day, the Internet day is a way bigger day for American history than fucking Columbus Day. If they came out with an Internet day, that would be important. But

Speaker 4:          02:27:01       December 20, first 2012 has to be like that Internet day. It has to be David. We look back and go, wow, that day some shit started off. That's the day that changed everything. That's what, December 20, first 2012. It's got to be the, all the hype behind it. If it's not that, then it's bullshit, you know, this whole idea that it's the end of an age. So it's becoming a, a new era. Maybe, maybe, possibly. But to me that could just as easily happen tomorrow or being. Why do we assume that the Mayans were absolutely correct about that? Even if they were correcting, recognizing that human beings go in cycles, you know, that's uh, that's not, uh, an an old idea that you guys is a um, uh, and I believe Hindu idea. I think it's Hindu or along the same lines that there's, there's like stages that humanity goes for, goes through and that these stages of these cycles, that they're all repeatable, they just keep happening.

Speaker 4:          02:27:53       I can a cycle over and over again, just like how you breathe in, you breathe out, humanity rises and falls. And right now we're supposed to be in Kali Yoga and this. It's also supposed to end the same time around where the Mayans believe that this, this age is going to end and the same time we're terence Mckenna's, you know, timewave zero novelty theory, which a lot of people think is bullshit. I don't know if it's bullshit or not, but there was a guy named terrence Mckenna that had this crazy mathematical algorithm designed track time and it was based off the teaching. And the idea was that you could apply this to past events and show that all human innovation, that progress in humanity is all like you could chart it on a graph that it's all like going along a certain direction and that eventually was going to reach a point of what he called ultimate novelty.

Speaker 4:          02:28:40       And the idea of ultimate novelty would be something that we would figure out or do like create a time machine or something like that. That would literally change everything as we know it. You know? And that Ray Kurtzweil calls it the singularity. You know that there's a bunch of different scientists that believe we're moving towards this convergence, this one big invention, and they tie that into the mind thing that December 20, first 2012 is exactly the same as the ending point for ultimate novelty for timewave zero, and that Terence Mckenna arrived at that time. Completely independent of the Mayan calendar. I don't know if it's bullshit. You don't have really studied at either. Right?

Speaker 3:          02:29:19       Did he tell you about this whole thing and he just programmed this logic around that date?

Speaker 4:          02:29:24       It's possible. It's possible. It didn't seem like he was a liar though. I mean, he might've been kind of a hippie

Speaker 3:          02:29:29       and they're. They're all lies. They all want the money so they could buy weed,

Speaker 4:          02:29:34       fucking patrolling. Maybe we don't know if it was a. What we do know is this fucking thing has been going on for two hours and 30 minutes and that's it. It's over. Religious Gentleman. Brian and I are going to get something to eat and we're going to sign out. We're going to try to do this every week now.

Speaker 3:          02:29:51       Two hours every week.

Speaker 4:          02:29:52       Two hours, two hours and a half, right? Two hours is not so good, but, or two hours in the half is not so good. Two hours to perfect by now. But uh, we appreciate all 400 and fucking whatever. Have you. We had 500 people at one point in time. It's like a comedy club and as soon as we,

Speaker 3:          02:30:06       uh, it gets more Internet in here, we're going to start triple broadcasting it on both Justin TV

Speaker 4:          02:30:12       and all the other ones. I will, we'll put it on three and St. so we'll give you different angles to, to be a fucking Weirdo, you know? Can we get better, bigger heads up a couple of days. Yes. My friend Jim Dirksen did know, did Erik Didriksen Cim? Didrikson yeah, we'll, we'll, uh, we'll definitely get more advanced time. We just figured it out yesterday. We're going to do, and then I put it up and said we're going to do it in a couple hours, but um, what we'll do next time is what we're eventually going to do is have a specific time we start at every week. That sounds like a Wednesday. Yeah, Wednesday afternoons. Yeah, you're right. Because even if we go on the road for comedy, we don't leave until Thursday usually. So we'll do, we'll try to do a Tuesday or a Wednesday and that's, we'll do, we'll do like late afternoon in La, like 3:00 is perfect somewhere around that line and we'll do it on a regular basis. So, um, this week I'm at the House of Blues on, um, Saturday. Yeah. Saturday night. The house Friday night, the House of Blues this Friday in Vegas. That's January first. There's still tickets available for that New Year's Eve in melrose at the Improv in Hollywood on a Thursday night. It's sold out. So that's sold out, but there's still some tickets available for the house of Blues. So if you're going to be in Vegas, um, Brian's not common unless he wants to, wants to change his mind.

Speaker 3:          02:31:28       Vegas on New Year's Day just seems like that dried puke everywhere. It's hell it August.

Speaker 4:          02:31:36       Um, but, uh, New Year's Eve, like I said, it's all sold out. Sorry, but a new year's day, January first the house of blues at Mandalay Bay and it'd be Joey Diaz and Arash fear far doesn't kill himself for them. Hopefully won't. So, uh, thank you very much everybody. Thanks for tuning into this and, uh, we'll see you next week. We're going to do this every week. Okay, bitches. All right, thanks.

Speaker 3:          02:32:05       Stop recording.
