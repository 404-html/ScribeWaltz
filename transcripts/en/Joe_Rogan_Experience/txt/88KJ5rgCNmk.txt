Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello Freak bitches. When did this start? When did the trigger warnings? When did the safe spaces, when did all this emerge? Well, it has its roots in the student radical Islam of the 19 sixties, especially the far left radicalism. It really popped up in the 19 nineties and the early nineties when I was teaching in the US at that point and which are, you know, I taught at Harvard from 93 to 98 and there was a fair push for political correctness especially in the early part of the nineties, but, but it got pushed back down and disappeared and went under ground. It went underground is more accurate and then it's just come back with a vengeance in the last five years and I think it's partly because we have all these radical left political activist departments at the universities, women's studies being at the top of the, of the list that have done nothing for the last 30 years to even longer than that. Now it's almost 40 years, 30 years, let's say, have done nothing but produce an never ending stream of ideological. He reminded counter civilization, political activists, and that's all subsidized by, by tuition and by the public purse, and that's another thing we really got to ask ourselves is why the hell are we subsidizing revolution? Why are we doing that? It's crazy and it's dangerous. It's dangerous.

Speaker 1:          01:24          What? So what exactly is going on with women's studies that you believe is fostering revolution? Wow. You'd go on their websites and read, read what they say. I mean, first of all, for the, for the women's studies types, and this is a, what would you call it, a false anthropology. There's this idea that way back when there was a feminist paradise and that would be like noble savage mode of living where everything was egalitarianism and a women dominated. It was a matriarchal culture that was put forward by Ucla anthropologist named [inaudible] tests. I can never pronounce her name properly, but I think I got it. And then that was overthrown by patriarchal institutions, start essentially starting at about the time, say, of the, of, of, of Judaism. And that was all overthrown. And ever since then we've lived in an oppressive patriarchy. And that's what our culture is.

Speaker 1:          02:19          It's an oppressive patriarchy. So they're pointing to one unsuccessful society that they believe existed or did it? No, no, it didn't exist. There's no evidence for whatsoever. It's, it's, it's complicated, but it's the, it's the telling of a kind of psychological myth as if it was history and, and, and anyway. So, so the basic claim is that Western civilization is a brutish patriarchy and that whatever positive things that might have managed to accomplish were all accomplished as a consequence of oppression and, and uh, and theft. And that the appropriate thing to do is to restructure it from the bottom up. And they mean that they mean that they mean every single bloody concept. And you can marry that modern postmodernism and throw in a nice stash of Marxism and you have the, the ideological and motivated grounds for social revolution. And I'm just go online and look at a dozen women's studies websites.

Speaker 1:          03:14          Just read them. You can see what they say. They produce political activists and their goal is to restructure the patriarchy. Well, what's the patriarchy? While the patriarchy is Western civilization and what is restructure mean? That's easy. It means tear it down and destroy it. Why? Because it's a brutish system that's predicated on nothing but oppression. It's nothing but a tyranny in the, in the eyes of the, of the radical women's studies types, heterosexuality. That's a tyranny. Capitalism. That's a tyranny. Democracy. Well, that doesn't even exist. And even if it did, it would be a tyranny. Everything's a tyranny. And so you can ask these and and what would they replace it with? They replace it with their own ideological utopia. While we've already had 100 years of that, we saw what happened. Oh well that doesn't matter. That wasn't real Marxism. That's what the bloody marks is.

Speaker 1:          04:04          Always say that wasn't real Marxism. It's like, oh, how many millions of people have to die before you're convinced that it's real Marxism. And I know what they mean by that too. They mean, hey, if I was the Marxist dictator, things would gone a lot better. It's like a. You should think again, sunshine. If you were the Marxists dictator, things wouldn't have gotten a lot better. So if you're the sort of person that thinks that if you would have been controlled, things would've gotten a lot better than you're exactly the sort of person who should never be in control. So. And it's resentment. It's horrible. Resentment, you know? That's an important point because I think this is something that you've said that I absolutely agree with that I think a lot of this thinking and the way people are behaving, it seems based on revenge.

Speaker 1:          04:50          It seems based on revenge for awkward upbringings, so social uncomfortable of uncomfortability. That seems like there's something about the way they view the world where they want to get back at people that have literally done them no wrong. It's resentment for the burden of being. It's deeper, it's deeper, but I mean human being human existence is characterized by a fair bit of suffering. You know, we're limited creatures and life is very hard. Everyone dies. Everyone you love is going to die. Most of the things you do, all of the things you do will eventually fail. You know, suffering is a certainty and it's very easy for people to become resentful about, about being, about existence. You know, these kids who shoot up high schools and, and, and these mass shooters there, they're the perfect examples of, of people who run on nothing but resentment. They're out to kill the innocent because that's the best marker of a.

Speaker 1:          05:43          that's the best way of showing just how much contempt they have for existence itself. Why punish the guilty? They deserve to be punished. It's a lot more malevolent and, and, and, and, and vengeful to punish the innocent. It's like people are motivated to a great degree by resentment of being. And a huge chunk of that is manifested in, out to the dark side of the ideological possession. So I get to decide who my enemies are and then I get to go after them and I can go after them for every single thing that's ever been done to me that isn't good. And well, a lot of that's just built into the structure of existence. Then they group up, they exhibit confirmation bias. They all form some sort of a group think and then they act accordingly and this is what you've been warning against and this is where I completely agree with you in this way.

Speaker 1:          06:30          I think the subject is so important and I love the way you've outlined all the steps and the problems with Marxism and ideologies in general that we are dealing with this. These are the beginning steps of it and people who look at it now and they say it's social change and social justice. It's not. It's not. It's not. That's right. It's not. This is not going to improve things. Implementing these policies will make things worse. They've made things worse. Every single place they've ever been implemented and often they've made things so much worse that you actually can't imagine it and people don't do the reading. I've done the reading, I've done the reading. I know how bad things can get. They can get so bad that no matter how bad you think they are, you're not even in the bloody ballpark. Well, it's just so strange that these sort of courses and these sorts of ideologies are thriving in universities and it's really disconcerting to someone who has children. You know, that your children are going to go there and they going to trade schools. You know, I think, I think that, wow, I think I used to teach at Harvard, just send them to trade schools, the universities. I think the universities, I think you can make good, reasonable case that the universities do more harm than good. Now, I hate to say that.
