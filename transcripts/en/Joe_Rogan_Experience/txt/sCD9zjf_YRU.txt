Speaker 1:          00:00:08       Yes, we live Ben Shapiro. Hey, how's it going dude? Very good. How's it going with you man? It's going well. I love you. I love the new day cause they haven't been here since you finished it over and I had walked in, I thought to myself, I've been doing my business wrong. I mean you got what? Three employees? Yeah. There's not that many folks working on this. Yeah, I mean, yeah. So in my offices we have like 80 and our offices are not nearly this cool. So I'm going to go back to my office and fire everyone. Have your folks come in and design? Because I mean it's either a lot of people or I could have cars in my office.

Speaker 2:          00:00:41       Yeah, but you wouldn't go down this route. You're, you're a more of a conservative gentleman. No, myself. [inaudible] you're wearing a suit jacket. You're your own boss. Nobody tells you how to dress and get you dressed like a grownup.

Speaker 1:          00:00:51       Yeah. Well, you know, I won't pretend that nobody tells me how to dress. We have people who tell me how to dress. We have people who do my hair. Do you have all that stuff you have like fashion folks? Because I used to, I mean if you look at the old photos of me, I have like the Hitler hair, I've got like the, the hair, that's the only thing about me, the till area and was my old hair and I've got that, the hair that kind of comes down over the forehead and I still walk into the office wearing basically an undershirt every day because I'm incredibly lazy when it comes to that stuff. But we to be able to, yeah, I mean that's, that's the prerogative of being the boss. Maybe it'd be more relatable live you showed up wearing like flip flops and tee shirt. That kind of kills my brand though. Now does it like it is your brand. Exactly. I thought it was being an asshole.

Speaker 2:          00:01:30       I think you're an asshole though. Thank you. I appreciate it. It revert. Nice guy. You're just conservative. That's the dirty little secret though. Yeah. We're not supposed to. We're not supposed to talk about that. But this is one of the things that bothers me so much about you being so misrepresented. When I read things about you, there was a, the, the article that we were just talking about, the alt right seeds without the rage, they called you and you're not even remotely alt right. In fact, you were the leading target of antisemetic abuse for all of 2016 are you?

Speaker 1:          00:01:57       Yeah, according to the Anti Defamation League, which is no ally of mine. So yeah, I mean, I'm not only am I not outright, I've spent the last four years like legitimately battling the alt right, talking about how evil, I think their ideology is, how evil I think white supremacy he is. I mean, first of all, like people at the Amika is typically not the favorites of the alt right. And then beyond that, I mean, I think their ideology is legitimately a devastatingly awful twist on what Western civilization is supposed to be. It was amazing as a review of my new book and my new book has several sections and they're dedicated to how terrible the outright is. And then the interview they did with me. It doesn't talk about outright stuff at all, but they just assume I'm on the conservative. Right and that must mean that I am all outright and it's like no you stupid. No problem with those labels, disingenuous

Speaker 2:          00:02:41       people are labeling people in a very simple manner to try to categorize them as the enemy and instead of just addressing these points like I love watching your debates where you do Q and A's with college students and with people in the audience because you can see, you will agree with you or disagree with you. You have well formulated ideas. This isn't just some bullshit that you're spouting out. You thought these things through.

Speaker 1:          00:03:04       I've been doing this for legitimately more than half my life. I'm 35 and I started when I was 17 and I started writing a syndicated column at that point and when you're 17 you think a lot of dumb stuff and then sure we get older and you educate yourself and you spend a lot of time reading and a lot of time studying. Hopefully you have some cogent arguments after 20 years of doing anything. I mean, but it's the, the demonization is pretty astonishing. I mean, we had an on Andrew Yang, he's the only Democratic candidate who has agreed to go on the Sunday special that I do. We did a full hour on ubi. It was perfectly nice. It was perfectly coherent and, and, and conciliatory. And yet people will suggest that everything I do is about destroying people on the other side because of all the Ben Shapiro destroys videos and all that kinds of stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:03:44       There's, there are certain groups of people where that's their shtick there. Like they're goons, right? They just go after people online for attention. Yes. This is a stick. This is not you. And this is what bothers me so much. And I know that you've said some things in the past like particularly about Arabs and like when you were a younger man that you said,

Speaker 1:          00:04:03       I shouldn't have said that. Yeah, that's exactly right. That's exactly right. Some of those things were taken out of context. Like that one particular tweet, which is a bad tweet, was a tweet that was part of a tweet thread in which has specifically contracting Israel and the Hamas leadership and saying that the Israeli government likes to build and the Hamas leadership lid prefer that their citizens live in sewage and bomb things. But that was a bad tweet obviously. Yeah. My entire history on on Muslim relations is one, like I supported the ability of Ilhan Omar to wear hijab on the, on the floor. I opposed. President Trump's originally proposed Muslim ban, uh, in the last three weeks I've had on machine Nawaz I've had on a contact med I had on yesterday, a reformed Muslim. Like these are conversations that have to be had, but to take, this is one of the things that bugs me so much.

Speaker 1:          00:04:49       I've, I've tweeted I think 140,000 times I've written millions of words. I'm sure you can find something. I don't even remember having written it is bad. I have a running list, by the way. I tried to be honest about this. I, I'm one of the only people I know who has, I have a running list it's called. So here's a giant list of all the dumbest stuff I've ever done. Right? And I actually go through all this, like you can look it up. This is not me saying this now. I mean, you can go and look up all the things that I think I've done wrong. And I'll apologize for some, and I'll say somewhere dom, and I'll say some I'm fine with, and you're just taking out of context. But I mean, I hope that's when honest people tried to do,

Speaker 2:          00:05:19       but this is the problem. You're not dealing with. Honest people would, when people try to categorize you as outright or they're, they're trying to put you into this category of Internet goon there they, and they did quote tweet. There's taking some little tiny phrase that you said seven years ago and trying to say, this is you. This is, you know, it's, so that's such a disingenuous thing to do.

Speaker 1:          00:05:42       I hate it. And I hated across the aisle by the way, like that. It was a defender of James Gunn. I thought James Gunn shouldn't have been fired from guardians of the galaxy. Yeah. Over the old dumb jokes. Right. And that's exactly right. Yeah. And even if somebody tweeted something bad like 10 years ago, bringing it up now is not an to actually make the public space better. And you're not actually offended by that thing that person tweeted 10 years ago that you didn't notice what it is that you want to get rid of this person or hurt this person. So you're going to bring up something from 10 years ago and then you're going to try and club them into submission with it. Because if you actually ask them their opinion about it, they might have a more nuanced view on what they said. Maybe they apologize and they maybe they think, I don't even remember saying that.

Speaker 1:          00:06:18       I, I felt the same way by the way. I try to be consistent. I really do. About about this stuff. I said the same thing about, for example, Ralph Northam, the governor of Virginia who was excoriated for having this terrible racist photo on his yearbook page back in medical school in 1987 and people were saying, well, this is evidence he's racist now. It's like, well no, that's evidence that he was doing it racist thing then that's not evidence that he's racist now. You sort of have to look over the broad course of his career and he ended up doing what everyone now does, which is you just don't apologize for anything. You just try to pass it off as nothing. The public space is actually getting worse because let's say that you did something bad in the past. There are a few human responses to, I did something I don't like him past human response number one is, you know what?

Speaker 1:          00:07:00       I apologize. That was wrong these days. That gets your face step done, right? You say, I apologize, I was wrong. It means, well, why did you do it in the first place because you're a bad person. Apologies are not accepted. And then number two is you braise in it out. You do the Trump. You know, I never did anything wrong, ever. I've never perfect right and that, and then you get your defenders to come and surround you and then nothing ever gets cleansed or opportunity. Number three is you do what Barack Obama did, which is you come out preemptively and you try to remember all the bad stuff you do and then you confess it in public. So in dreams from my father, he says, right, well you know when I was back in high school did a little blow. Everyone's like, oh, okay, so he did cocaine when he was in high school.

Speaker 1:          00:07:36       That's, that's cool. Whereas if it comes out during the campaign and he's known, right, then he's got and he's got a real problem. The problem is that right now, even if you preemptively come out and say, I did something wrong. Like, for example, Liam Neeson talking about years ago when he had a racist thought that he didn't act on when he had a racist thought, this is now we're going to try and ruin your career for something that you admit was bad that you did 30 years ago. We're going to try and run you over that. If you apologize for something that you did 30 years ago, which you would have preferred, just got forgotten because it was embarrassing and stupid, then we say you're bad. And so all you're left with is like the most shameless people in the world who are in the public space, right? The incentive structure is to be deeply shameless, to just say, yeah, man, I own that. And it was great when I said it, or I didn't say it at all. And you're just, you're just full of it. I never said that stuff. Oh, who are you going to believe your eyes were me? And it makes, it makes for a really bad politics.

Speaker 2:          00:08:28       Well, it's just this, uh, the culture of, of going after people for things and finding any thing to categorize them as someone who's a viable target. And this is what I've seen. Thrust your way. It's like there's nothing wrong with being conservative. There's something wrong with wanting everyone to think the way you think though. This is the difference. Like you w w what I liked that you do is you debate your points, you state your positions, you have a philosophy. And what I don't like is when people try to pretend that that philosophy is some somewhat somehow hateful or somehow regressive or some like your, that you condemn people for their thoughts. You, you just, you don't, this is what I, not what I see with you.

Speaker 1:          00:09:10       I appreciate that and I appreciate the accuracy because I think that's true. I mean, I've come out against virtually every Twitter band, including people who have personally targeted me. I've come out against that have come out against virtually every,

Speaker 2:          00:09:21       what would they talk about that? Because what are you, what are your thoughts about this idea of d platforming and you know, this is something that we were just discussing before the podcast, um, where the CEO of Youtube and it's Kara Swisher's from code, I think Kara Swisher. They were talking about removing you from Youtube and I thought it was the CEO of Youtube. It was actually Kara who said I would, if I could.

Speaker 1:          00:09:43       Yeah, she was pissed because her son apparently listens to, that's kind of funny. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:09:46       If she's being funny saying, but it was, I thought it was the CEO of [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          00:09:51       She was trying to much more disturbed. She was trying to do the same thing that they do with you or with Dave Rubin or Jordan Peterson, which is that anybody who is sort of heterodox because in that group I think I'm the only registered Republican. Every anybody who's Heterodox is now being mixed portrayed. Is it docs meaning just thinks differently from kind of the down the line Democratic Party platform. You're not like down the line with Hillary like Sam Harris who's a democrat. Sam Harris's Heterodox because he disagrees that Islam is by necessity a religion of peace, for example. Right? Or he thinks that we have to look@actualstatisticsinordertomakeevidentiarybasepointsaboutdiscriminationanddisparityandthismakeshimanenemyofpeoplelikeezrakleinatvox.com right. Th th this sort of stuff, they then say that you are a feed or for white supremacy, right? They, they, they can't actually get you on what you say. Yeah. So it turns into, well, you know, some members of your audience do things that, that are really bad. It's like, well dude, I have like millions of people who are members of my audience. I have 5 million Facebook followers. I have 2 million on Twitter and you're way bigger than I am. I assume that some of those people are going to be crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:10:55       I mean, yeah, I would assume. Yeah. The idea that your respect, well this is what youtube tried to do. You know about the comment thing where the youtube was going to try to make people responsible for the comments and their videos, which, what does a normal Jamie, like a normal video that we get, how many comments does it get?

Speaker 1:          00:11:11       I don't know, like 10,000.

Speaker 2:          00:11:12       It's like an average one. How the fuck am I supposed to have some dude with his itchy trigger fingers standing by in front of a keyboard just waiting for something offensive to pop up. And this was in response to something that happened with them where there was pedophiles who were watching videos of children doing things and they were commenting stuff in the children's gymnastics and stuff like that. They're commenting and like communicating with each other through the comments. And it was sort of, um, discovered that there was this, this connection that they were doing this in many, many videos and youtube rightly panicked and like, Holy Shit, we have to stop this. So the response I guess was we just have to make people responsible for their, someone said,

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       oh yeah, good idea. But you didn't think through it all right that certain people that can't do that, it's totally insane and it's insane. And in virtually every respect. And it's, it's funny how it's only applied kind of by the media on one side of the aisle. So to take an example, the congressional baseball shooting happens a couple of years ago. Guy Happens to be a Bernie Fan, is that Bernie Sanders is fault. No, that is not Bernie Sanders as well, in a way. Right? Literally people stop talking about it. And, and that was shooting of legislators, like elected people. One nearly died and that kind of went away. We didn't talk about, you know, Bernie's responsibility, but there's a shooting in Christchurch and it's Jordan Peterson's fall and Jordan Peterson has no relationship with the shooter whatsoever. It's my fault. I have no relationship with the shooter and denounce everything that that piece of crap stands for.

Speaker 1:          00:12:34       And suddenly it's, it, it's, it's really ugly and it's going to, it, it will come home to roost. I mean, here's what's going to happen is Facebook and youtube are going to fall prey to their own standards because if their standard is that you're responsible for your followers or I'm responsible for my followers or Jordan or anybody else's responsible for all the people who view their stuff, okay, then why isn't Facebook responsible for all the people posting on its platform? If they are right, if Facebook becomes responsible for all the people posting on his platform, they'll be bankrupt and a week they've got a problem. They really do because they have to decide whether they are our platform or whether they are a do gooder publication. I run A, I run a a publication daily wire. It's openly conservative. We make no bones about that and we are responsible for the content that appears on our platform and if we say something defamatory, we will be sued.

Speaker 1:          00:13:20       If we say something that is false, then we will be sued. Presumably if you post something false on Facebook, Facebook doesn't get sued, but now Facebook has deemed itself the morality police, no band people they don't like and they'll decide what editorially ought to be elevated and what ought not to be elevated. Does that sound more like the phone company to you or does that sound more like my website where I decide what gets published and what doesn't? Right. Because Facebook's case for exemption from these laws is, well we're like the phone company, right when you're on the phone with somebody, if that person says something criminal t and t isn't responsible for the person saying something criminal or terrible, it's just the phone company. But Facebook isn't doing that. Facebook has is jumping into the middle of conversations and then saying, well we don't really like this conversation so we're just going to kind of shut it down.

Speaker 1:          00:14:04       Not because of legal threat, but because we just don't like it. So are they actually doing that? I'll say if you put a post up on Facebook and they don't like the way you word things or describe things with, they actually shut down your post. Where what will they do so they've done it in the past. To some conservative public is pretty controversial because they're not transparent at all. I can tell you that the beginning of 2018 we lost about 35% of our traffic because Facebook started cracking down on mostly conservative sites. They said that it was kind of new sites generally, but that's not what the statistics showed. They're doing it more often with things that we all sort of agree are bad, right? We all agree white supremacy is bad. White nationalism is bad. Now they say they're going to censor that stuff, but here's where I'm uncomfortable.

Speaker 1:          00:14:44       I think that that stuff is awful and evil and those people are, the ones are the, they're the reason I have personal security, but once you get into the business of Facebook gets to decide which speech is good and which speeches bad. They're an editor there, an editor. Even if I agree with their assessment of what stuff is good and what is bad, I am not comfortable with them in the driver's seat there. And if they are going to be in the driver's seat, then they should be held liable for all the stuff that's on their platform. I mean, why isn't the Twitter, Twitter, same thing, right? Why is it that Louis Farrakhan is still on that platform but Alex Jones is not like, I don't like Alex Jones is material or I've been very, very critical of Alex Jones. I didn't think you should get banned from Twitter unless he actually violated the law in, unless he was responsible for a violent threat, unless he was defamatory or something.

Speaker 2:          00:15:28       They're definitely going down this road of being the moral arbitrators. They're, they're the ones who get to decide what the conversations are and h and that's an insane responsibility. The responsibility of getting to dictate what should and should not be discussed and to have it to be a handful of people and have these people almost almost exclusively live in the Pacific and you know in north of San Francisco that that whole tech community, I mean it's all tech liberals who really, if you're around those people, they live in this really strange Uber wealthy bubble of super genius spectrum people who are coders and super capitalists and people that are raising money all over the place and designing technology and they have an ideology and it's not necessarily a bad one just just being honest and upfront about what it is. It's incredibly progressive, which is very unusual for big business, right? For big business to be just openly, transparently progressive and pushing social justice. It's very unusual.

Speaker 1:          00:16:35       Well I think that there is a sort of misunderstanding of when we say what big business is, what big businesses. So I think that there's a wide variety of owners of businesses and how they think about politics obviously. Yeah. Bill Gates is a Progressive Guy, Warren Buffet's progressive guy.

Speaker 2:          00:16:47       They are now his whole life. And he's ruthless with Microsoft.

Speaker 1:          00:16:54       Well, so I think that there are a lot of people, listen, I think that that the vast majority, I think mark Zuckerberg is ruthless with Facebook and used progressive. I think Jack Dorsey is as ruthless as the next guy when it comes to profit. I mean, he's still got to be answerable to the shareholders. So I think, I think a lot of the progressivism is sort of a, a way to excuse your own in your own involvement in the capitalist market.

Speaker 2:          00:17:14       Facebook took off. Don't be evil. That was their thing. Don't be evil. They decided to remove that. Let's Google, right? I'm sorry Google. Yeah, when Google did that, I met Google. But just funny when you think something, but you're saying, um, when they did that, it's like, why would you ever take off? Don't be evil like cheap that, but here's the thing.

Speaker 1:          00:17:35       Here's my thing. I think that if our tech companies were honest, they should take that stuff off. Like stop pretending you're do Gooding. You're not do good and you're providing a platform and maybe the platform is the good, right? In a capitalist economy, the product that you provide is the good, I don't need additional good to come from your product, right? If you want to provide me a solid morning drink, right? I don't need your politics. Along with that, I just need the drink. Okay, well if I want a social media company, I don't give two craps about what Mark Zuckerberg thinks about politics. Dude hasn't studied it. I don't care at all. What Jack Dorsey, who vacations in Malaysia and gets bitten by a million mosquitoes while meditating. [inaudible] has to say about the nature of life. Like what? Why do I care about Jack Dorsey's political view? He has provided me a good, the good is this basic chat room where I'm consuming news.

Speaker 1:          00:18:18       How about that would just be enough, but it's not enough for a lot of these folks. It's, it's the, the kind of Hooli from Silicon Valley. We're going to pretend that we're here to do good and it's not enough just to acknowledge that maybe the thing that you provided is the good, like Bill Gates has done more good with Microsoft and then he has done with any of his charities. He's even a lot of money to charity, but Microsoft has provided legitimately hundreds of thousands of jobs and created enormously productive lines of business and made enormous profit for a lot of people. A lot of people have stock in Microsoft as a general, as a basic factual thing. He has done more good doing that. Then giving tens of millions of dollars to, to various outside causes. So it feels like a lot of the progressivism in in corporate halls and in Silicon Valley is bifurcated mentally. It's like people have it, they're like dolphins, just one side of the brain on at a time. Here's my, here's my capitalist side where I got and make money and profit. And then here's my other side where I show people what a great person I am by proclaiming that I'm for Bernie Sanders while parking my money off shore to make sure that they're, it's shielded from that, from the tax man.

Speaker 2:          00:19:22       Yeah. Well that's a good assessment. Um, what I'm saying is that the don't be evil thing. Like one of the things that I thought was what if that was like a legal decision was me being cynical, that they were pulled into some sort of an office and said, um, if we say don't be evil and you take someone off the platform, you're accusing them of evil.

Speaker 1:          00:19:43       That's it. I mean, then we should slow that down. Maybe, I mean, again, this, this, this self assessment of you are the moral police I find really troubling it. It's so funny. I'm the, I'm the suppose in more or less, right? Right. I'm, I'm the religious guy. I'm in the Orthodox Jew, right? I talk about social standards and how people should behave in their personal life. But when it comes to government and when it comes to me imposing my views on you, I am way less of a top down higher rent than any of the people in Silicon Valley. I am not here to tell you that you are not allowed to be on a platform because we disagree. It's one thing if you're threatening violence, which is an actual violation of law, but this crap where people like me because I believe in a social fabric built, uncertain, Judeo Christian values.

Speaker 1:          00:20:21       But I'm not forcing you to be part of that. And I'm not. I don't think the government should compel you to be a part of that, or I'm the tyrant. But the person who sits at the top of Twitter or Facebook who is saying that they get to police what you see and they're going to nudge you in the right direction, nudge you in the right direction without your consent, without them even telling them what you're doing right. They, they're just, they're gonna push you a little bit because they know better than you and they can sort of massage you in a better views if we control your channels of information. This is the Obama administration was very fond of, there's a scholar in cass Sunstein as a legal scholar and he wrote a book called nudge. He was very famous. It was, it was used to sort of a handbook during the Obama administration and the idea as well, if we can just use a non forcible means to sort of nudge people in a particular direction without them even knowing they're being nudged, then shouldn't we do that? And I think, no, you shouldn't. You shouldn't. Because transparency is the only way I can tell what kind of bullshit you're trying to sell me.

Speaker 2:          00:21:13       Well, not just dot. Like you, you're, you're closing down even conversation. If soon as you trying to silence this other voice, if you, if you believe one thing and another person belief at different thing, you should probably talk about and the way, the way that I know for sure there's something wrong with your argument is if what you're trying to do is you're sneakily trying to silence these voices. And again, as long as we're not talking about threats of violence and as long as we're not talking about harassment or Doxing, right? We're just talking about conversation. You're just talking about people with differing points of view. If you want to silence differing points of view, I have to wonder about your intent. I have to wonder about whether you're going into this conversation with good faith. I have to wonder whether you've really objectively assessed whether or not you, your argument does hold up against scrutiny because this is also part of the problem and when you're in an echo chamber, you often don't formulate these arguments very well. Like when you confront people about certain bias beliefs that they have and you, you have a an opposing belief. If they're a part of a bubble, like sometimes they might not have even ever considered some of the things you have to say. And I've seen that with some of your videos.

Speaker 1:          00:22:17       Yeah, I mean it does happen all the time and with sophisticated people where I'd spent my entire life, literally my entire life in areas where everyone disagrees with me. Yeah. I grew up in La. I went to Harvard law school for three years. I was in Cambridge where everyone disagreed with me and then I came back to la. So I have never spent more than a week at a time in a red state.

Speaker 2:          00:22:35       Right. Whoever is you have your conservative values moved in one way or another of the,

Speaker 1:          00:22:41       I mean, I should say that at all. My personal valley's probably haven't shifted very much, but my political values have shifted. Libertarian. Mm. I mean, so I used to be a proponent of criminalization of marijuana. I'm no longer, I've been in favorites for you. A couple of things. One was just a general sense of the government sucks at everything and the more I see the government tried to crack down on things, the more prevalent it becomes. I mean, people were dealing pot now on my sixth grade, seventh grade playground in public school. So obviously like mellow. Yeah, exactly. And then it's terrible. Just a general, a general perception. Not only the government sucks at everything, but that you got to own your own actions and also examining more of the evidence about the impact of, of pot on people's lives. And, and you know, again, there's you ruining your own life through use of drugs and there's drugs that legitimately ruined other people's lives right there.

Speaker 1:          00:23:30       There are drugs that remove your ability to even reason or thing. I think there are only two reasons to criminalize drugs in any fashion. One is if there are drugs like for example, PCP that legitimately make you violent, uh, and then you are going out and committing acts of violence against people, then there's the case. Uh, or if you're talking about a drug where it legitimately robs you of your capacity to reason. If it were a heroin, if you were able to actually crack down on it successfully. But even there, I'm not sure that the proper government solution is criminalization because we've criminalized it and it's still incredibly prevalent. So it's agree with you. I agree with her on that. And I agree with you in terms of drugs being extremely detrimental. And the other part is that there's comparable drugs that are illegal and comparable drugs, meaning not even really comparable drugs that are far more devastating like alcohol.

Speaker 1:          00:24:20       Like you, you could just go to any grocery store and buy a jug of whisky and kill yourself with it. It's not difficult. And just drink the books already that prevent externalities. If you drive high, it's the same as driving drunk. So I'm not sure that you need additional laws to do that. And also, you know, I'm not opposed to zoning laws. Like I don't think a pot shop should open up right next to my house right there. Residential Zoning. That's fine. Sand with liquor stores though, right? I don't want to liquor store right next to my house. This is correct. Right. So the, so I become a libertarian in some ways on that sort of stuff. At the same thing is true by the way, when it comes to the issue of same sex marriage. So on a personal moral level, I'm opposed to same sex marriage.

Speaker 1:          00:24:56       I'm an Orthodox Jew and I believe that a man and a woman were made for each other when it comes to government involvement. I don't think that's anybody's business. I think a lot of things, I think adults raise bad too. I don't think the government ought to be involved in adultery. I, I'm, I'm so strict. I don't think premarital sex is a good thing, right. I, I've been very vocal about this. I was a virgin until I was married. My wife was a virgin until she was married. I think that's a good thing. So I think the government has anything to do with any of those things. No, I don't. I don't think it's any of the government's business. It's consensual activity. There are no externalities. So what exactly is the government getting involved in? And when the government gets involved in stuff, then there are externalities.

Speaker 1:          00:25:30       Right? Once the government starts to cram down its vision on people, then you start to get unintended externality. So for example, with the law, with the legalization, my view on marriage is that the government should get completely out of the business. I don't think the government should be involved in straight marriage. I don't think it should be involved in gay marriage. I think the government should be out. I agree 100% and the reason that I say that is because as a religious person, right? Who believes in traditional marriage, I have two, I have to marriage certificates, I have the one from the state that I don't give two craps about. It's buried somewhere in my garage. And then I have my religion, my religious marriage certificate, which meant among other things that I got to shut up my wife, right? I mean like this was the one that mattered to me.

Speaker 1:          00:26:06       And I think that's true for most religious people. The religious ceremony matters a lot more than the state saying a thing. And the state isn't incentivizing. There's people aren't getting married because they're like, yeah, I need the tax break. So that's a bunch of nonsense. And once the government decides what version of marriage and wants to push, that then comes into conflict with other values. So for example, once the state of California decides that same sex marriage is on legal par with heterosexual marriage, now I'm worried about the externality of I have a religious day school or I have a, my, my synagogue, my synagogue is a religious institution. It doesn't approve of same sex marriage. Now is the government going to come in and tell my synagogue how it ought to act with regard to same sex marriage? I don't think that's the government's. So how about

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       this? How about everybody gets to do basically what they want associate with whom they want and it's none of the government's business. This seems like a pretty good, happy medium. I, I'm so glad you talked about the two things that I want to talk to you about that I'm sure we disagree. One of them be in marijuana and the other one being gay people marrying each other. Um, so let's start with the marijuana one. Do you think marijuana ruins people's lives? Is it's, is that one of your contentions? Um, I think that it can and I think in the same way I ever had any experience with marijuana, no, I'm just talking about the, I'm just talking about the statistical over use of marijuana among teenagers does have detrimental brain effects that have some long term after effects. It's pretty proven and that's one of the things that I really, I'm glad you said that because I wanted to cover that when you were in the middle of a rant, what we were joking around about sixth and seventh graders selling pot.

Speaker 2:          00:27:29       Don't smoke pot when you're young. You really should, it's not good for the development of your brain. Same thing with drinking. You know, I didn't smoke a lot of pot when I was a kid. I did it a handful of times until I was 30 years old. But I did drink a bunch of times when I was young and in high school and it's terrible for brain development, especially before you're 25 and your, your, your funnel cortex hasn't even fully formed. Your frontal lobe is like this. It's, it's, it's a developing thing there. There was an article recently that I posted from BBC. There were saying that you should probably shouldn't be considered an adult until you're 30. Right? They're saying brain development doesn't even stop until you're 26 or 20. This is why when, when people are saying, let's, let's lower the voting age 16.

Speaker 2:          00:28:06       I'm like, what the, what the fuck are you talking about? When I was 16, I wish I champ. You know, I mean, it was a champion of high school. Now when the problem that I have with many people's perceptions on marijuana is that it's based on ignorance, meaning not no personal experience with, you know, and listen, I'll admit I have no personal. I know. I know. You don't. I'm not speaking. Probably we should get high. That's what I'm trying to tell you, man. I seen the effects on stock prices. When people get hired in the city, they jump up, man. He jumped down for a little one, a bunch of chickens jump off the boat, then they come right back up. Um, the marijuana thing is in my opinion, uh, it's another one of those things where people have this, this categorized box that they like to put marijuana users in.

Speaker 2:          00:28:55       Like this is the category. Lazy Stoner, stupid, delusional. It's too widespread for that. I mean there, there are people I know who are doctors who, yes, so, well there's the Jiu Jitsu community is a big one. There's a giant percentage of the Jiu Jitsu community that does Jujitsu high. They have competition. It's more a party. It's not man, I'm telling you that because it's not what people think it is. If you've never smoked marijuana, this is going to be a very difficult thing to grasp. But marijuana enhances Jujitsu because it eliminates the rest of the world. When you're rolling, which rolling is like, say if, uh, you and Jamie were going to have a sparring match that would be rolling. Like you'd slap hands and then you'd go and you try to choke him and he's trying to get you in an arm bar and you're going after it. When you do that on marijuana, it's like you don't

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       think of anything else other than those movements and it becomes like this very intense meditation and violence. Like it's not violent in terms of most of the time you don't really even get hurt. He like you get to the point, one of the beautiful things about Jujitsu is you can grab a hold of someone and choked him to the point where they're going to go to sleep and you would kill them if you kept going and they tap around your friends again and everybody's cool and you try to do it to me and I tried to do it to you and you really can do it reasonably hard without people getting hurt. And it happens every day, all throughout the world. A lot of these people are high and they're doing this Jujitsu practice in this all almost like a trends. It's like it's ascension state.

Speaker 3:          00:30:24       If you can function when you're using marijuana, I don't care, but you can. This is what I'm saying. Perceptions are off. I mean, I would assume there's a small subset of the population for whom that's not true. Right, who are over using marijuana. Yes, and that's probably the majority in fact. Okay, so, so then you know, but it's exactly the same way with food. I agree. So I don't think there's anything we disagree about here because I'm not talking about criminalizing marijuana use. I think that we should honestly discuss the evidence that for a subset of the population, there is some evidence that marijuana is addicting, but it's a subset. It's not everybody who's on marijuana, the vast majority of people on marijuana or not addicted to marijuana. I think in the same way the alcoholic, that Minster of alcohol as well it is, there's people that are going to be addicted to almost anything.

Speaker 3:          00:31:08       And I think there's, there's absolutely people that are addicted to sugar. This for sure, people that are addicted to nicotine and alcohol and all of these things that we let people have. The material addictiveness of marijuana is not comparable to opioids though for it. It's not even comparable to alcohol or nicotine. It's seems to be very rare when people become physically addicted to it. Extremely rare. And what's, what's common though is abuse and it's common in everything that human beings consume. It's a fused as common as we said with food, certainly common with alcohol. It's certainly common with pills. And this is why I really believe that the way to solve some of these problems is, is a social fabric problem. Like it's a parenting problem. It's a social fabric problem. It's a personal choice problem. That's why virtually every solution I suggested so funny and I'm constantly conservatives like me who are libertarian leaning or constantly accused of being non-compassionate.

Speaker 3:          00:31:57       No, it's just our compassionate solutions don't involve the use of government. It's like we're going to encourage people to make better decisions with their lives. And if you choose not to do that, it's a free country. Well, you know, coming from religious background, you have this community that reinforces this kind of behavior in thought. And I think that's one of the major, really one of the best benefits of religion is that moral fabric and that community, the sense of community. Even silly ones like Mormons, you know they're, they're the nicest folks, right? They believe something that is fucking patently insane. If you go and read the Joseph Smith texts from 1820 when he was 14 years old, the shit that he wrote, let me try not to get into doctrinal insanity. I wear a funny hat all day Syria. Just kind of get to that.

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       But you know, with that said, I mean Alexis de Tocqueville talks about this, you know, early on in the American republic, the idea is that what makes America very different is the idea. You don't need a big government when you do have a supportive social fabric where people feel like they're at least oriented toward a common goal. It's one of the problems that I think we have in the country right now. I'm not sure people are oriented toward even a common sense of, of conversation. You don't have to agree on, on everything in order to have a common sense of the important values that that unified the country are showing. Yes. Right. And I always use Sam Harris is sorta my bet. No, are here because he's obviously a militant atheist. I'm, I'm in equally and equally strong believer and yet when it comes to the things that we would like to see happen in the country, not on government policy level, but on a, let's have a conversation level and discuss on evidence level, we're on the same page. There's certain core assumptions you have to make in order for that to happen. In my argument about America and the West is that those core assumptions are built on Judeo Christian foundations. Sam's core argument seems to be that they're built on evolutionary biology. We differ a little bit there.

Speaker 2:          00:33:41       Mm. Um, well, I don't want to let this marijuana thing go to. One of the things that I wanted to bring up too was this idea that if you're religious person, don't you think that there's certain things that maybe God put here for us to consume, to change your perspective? To allow you to reach new levels of consciousness. Don't you think it's entirely possible that some of these things that are here, and I know you haven't experienced, but they might literally have been put there by God and there's some evidence to say that a lot of the texts from the Bible, that in particular, there was a, I think it was a university of Tel Aviv somewhere in in Jerusalem, or these scholars were, they were trying to decipher what it meant when Moses encountered the burning Bush. Right, and they believe that it may have been the Acacia tree, which is very rich and dimethyltryptamine, which is a psychedelic substance that actually that the brain produces.

Speaker 2:          00:34:39       It's very common in plants and they think that this might have been when he met God and the God was a burning Bush, that this might have been some crew translation of them being involved in some sort of a psychedelic experience. Now it sounds outlandish unless you've had that psychedelic experience and when you have, you very well could think that you were in a conversation with God. This is on earth and this is something that may very well have been lost information or this may very well have been rituals that people participated in to bring them closer together and to reinforce that sense of community that you do get from a church and you do get from a group of people that share more beliefs and values and there's, there's real good discussion that a lot of these experiences that became these religious doctrines came from psychedelic experiences. Now as someone who's never experienced that before, I know this is probably a very strange thing to try to even wrap your head around. It's, it is entirely alien until you experience it, but it might very well be religious.

Speaker 1:          00:35:42       I mean I've, I've heard that from other people who've been, who've used those kinds of direct me. See, I'm actually made this argument to me too about the use of psychedelics and any maybe mean. Dot. Again, I apples. Well. Okay, so then this argument, I will say I'm not super fond of the argument that God made something and therefor it's ours to use or be. I mean like I keep kosher, right? Like God made pigs, I don't need him. Right? So I am not a huge fan of the argument that because something is here or because in urges natural, therefore we ought to imbibe or therefore we ought to participate in a particular activity. You know, one of the things that I, that I'm very big on, I'm, I'm a, I'm a rationalist when it comes to religion, as much as you can be a rationalist with regard to religion, to the extent that I think that it's up to us to use our reasonable faculties to determine the proper use of things. So, which is why you shouldn't overuse drugs. Even if you're going to use drugs,

Speaker 2:          00:36:35       this is prior to the problem making things illegal. You make things illegal, then you really don't know what it is or how it affects the body or what's the right dose or the wrong dose. And then people get involved in these terrible situations where they're taking things. They're just guessing.

Speaker 1:          00:36:50       I mean there's truth to that, but it's also true that on a social level, I'm not talking about legal cause we totally agree on the legal level, on the social level, there's a couple of things that are true of, for example, the Orthodox Jewish community, low rates of addiction because people have that social fabric. They don't feel the necessity. Also, you know, as you say, substance use in moderation can actually be quite a good thing. So low rates of alcoholism in the Jewish community. And part of that is the fact that you are getting kiddish wine from the time you're a kid. Right? I mean you actually are our de-stigmatize. Yeah. It's de stigmatized. And the idea is that in its proper context, this could be a good thing. Right? Uh, so I'll admit, I don't know enough about the proper context of marijuana to know when it would be a quote unquote good thing. And so I can, and also be a good thing. This is what I'm trying to do. So, and also I'm, you know, I don't, the truth is I don't enjoy drinking. Right. I'm not, I'm not a drinker. I don't enjoy, I like reality. I like living in reality and I like experiencing it totally sober. So I've never really felt the urge to to do any of that stuff. I I hear the pitch, I hear the pitch, but I've never really felt the interior desire or need to.

Speaker 2:          00:37:51       Did you completely understand that? I think that what we're dealing with though is perceptions that have been molded by laws that were shaped by tyrants. That's what I think.

Speaker 1:          00:38:01       I mean again, that's totally possible and plausible. Yeah, and

Speaker 2:          00:38:06       historically accurate. I mean when it comes to prohibition, prohibition with alcohol didn't work. Plug prohibition with drugs is just making the cartels bigger and it's causing

Speaker 1:          00:38:16       no problems with organized crime. On a practical level. I agree. What letter you liked to answer don't like drugs. Government interventionism is generally a giant fail.

Speaker 2:          00:38:22       I think our perceptions of what is good for you and is bad for you is also based on laws that the government created ignorantly, these sweeping psychedelic act of 1970, which made virtually everything psychedelic. They could, they missed a few things, slipped through the cracks, but all of the tryptamines and or most of them, um, the silicide been LSD. All that stuff was made completely illegal by people really didn't even know what it was. And a lot of that is why we base our ideas of what's good or bad for you. It's, it's based on what is legal and what

Speaker 1:          00:38:56       well, I'll let other people have done with it on, on this area, I'll admit not only complete experiential ignorance but complete evidentiary ignorant. So I haven't examined the evidence. I really don't have strong opinions on any of this stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:39:06       It's one of the bridges that we all could use between conservative thought in liberal thought that particularly for people that are dying, it's one of the things that Johns Hopkins found. And, uh, so there's been other studies done and there has been therapy done on people that are dying of terminal diseases and they give them silicide [inaudible] and when they give them these mushroom trips, they have these beautiful experiences where they completely accept death and it's almost a universal reaction to it. The, the, like the, the amount of people who still experience a positive benefit months and months after the experience while they're dying, that they, they say this was an incredibly moving and powerful moment in my life that allowed me to accept the fact that my time here is done. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:39:51       I mean, listen, if, if that's something that, that works for people and that's what it's designed to do, then I don't know if it's designed well, he didn't do it. It was designed by God. It literally mine that that's fine. I mean, I think there's also the generalized religious counter argument that there are no shortcuts, no shortcuts to happiness. So let's it, let's pose a shortcut. I don't think, well that's the question, right? I mean like let's say that I could guarantee you that tomorrow you're going to be a happier person. All you have to do is take this regimen of, of drugs that you're going to take every day and it's gonna make you a happier person, a more well rounded person, but it's going to permanently change your brain chemistry. Is that something that you think is good or is it something you think is bad? Because from a religious perspective, there is an argument to be made that these are, this is work you need to do on yourself without outside aid if possible. If there's cases where he cannot, then you cannot. But yeah, you know, turns an interesting thought experiment.

Speaker 2:          00:40:42       Terence Mckenna had a line about that. Uh, he said that, uh, there was a joke about, uh, there was a monk and he met Buddha because Buddha came to town and he said, Buddha, he wanted to impress him. He said, I practiced the city of levitation and uh, I have done this for 10 years and now I can walk on water. And the Buddhist says, put the ferries, only a nickel. It's like, what are you fucking waste of your time? I'll be like, you can aid the progression rapidly with psychedelic drugs. And this is something that Ma, you know, do you know about maps and their work with Mtma and soldiers that have had PTSD and not too much? No, it's, it's phenomenal by giving these soldiers MTMA therapy, meaning they, they give them Mtma, which is essentially what people think of as ecstasy. The street name, they give them pure Mtma and then they assist them with, they actually have a psychologist sit with them, a therapist, and they go over all these details of these traumatic events and they come to peace with everything and they've had profound benefits for soldiers. And four, we, uh, some combat journalists did different people that have been over there. And I've experienced the horrors of war and, and just general PTSD maybe for people who have experienced violence attacks. The is shown to be one of the very best things we've ever discovered for helping people get past.

Speaker 1:          00:42:05       Here's to me, and I'm thinking about this on the fly because this is stuff I don't think of that very much. Um, but it's, it's, there's a complex moral equation to the extent that if you're talking about somebody who has PTSD, somebody has a condition and the only way to help that condition is to use these drugs. I've never had a problem with any of that stuff. Right? I mean I've hit, my grandfather was, was schizophrenia and bi, maybe bipolar, maybe schizophrenia. The diagnosis is not exactly clear. They prescribed him lithium and made him a lot better. Would he have been better off struggling with the schizophrenia? Of course. Not much better than he should have the lithium and then be able to live in his rational mind. So when there's a problem using drugs to get past it and work with it is a good thing.

Speaker 1:          00:42:43       You do run the risk of these sort of brave new world situation where you have a group of people who have a certain level of Ersatz happiness that is not driven by a point of view, but more by just the these chemicals in their body. The chemicals affect your point of view that that is 100% true. But are you, Yuval Harari talks about maybe this is the future, right? He talks about the idea that maybe the future is we just drug ourselves until we're happy. Basically a more that happiness is the drugs. Because if you're a scientific materialist, that's what it is. Happiness is just a bunch of chemicals flowing through your body. So if you can bring them in without self change, but I do wonder whether that robs people of a certain level of purpose that, that the struggle is part of being human.

Speaker 2:          00:43:26       I think we're changing what it is to be human just by carrying around phones. And it just,

Speaker 1:          00:43:31       I mean that's, that's true. But I think that that's again, one of the things that I think makes being a human worthwhile is the idea that you are struggling. Like I think, I think the struggle is actually meaningful. And I think that's why religions tend to set prophylactic rules sometimes for good and sometimes for ill. So for example, I, I am addicted to my phone. I mean there's just no question right? It's, it's in my hand all the time. And, but from Friday night to Saturday night, it's off. I can't look at it and forbidding from looking at it. And this breaks the cycle at least for one day a week. And that's a good thing. That makes me better as a human being. He's a limit I set for myself and then limit that I abide by. And if you believe in in self mastery, what, where's the happy medium between self mastery and I need a little bit of aid and I think that there, there is a happy medium there. Um, but I'm not sure that that, you know, drugs are the answer to, I don't think you're suggesting drugs or the county. Not

Speaker 2:          00:44:21       suggesting that there's also a problem with the word drugs that the, everything is under that blanket and that blanket can be entirely negative or extremely. But I know, but that's a pro. I use it too. I mean it's not, not accusing you but that that term it's a problem. It's a problem term because what these are, are substances that are psychoactive and some of them can be extremely beneficial. And some of them have short term experiences that last with longterm results and I don't think that there's enough knowledge that I don't think the people that are negative against it have experienced enough of it or have looked at it in an objective, rational way because I think it's something that could be here to aid perspective. The give people a chance to think outside of their normal conditioned way of thinking that might have been established by their community or by their church or by their neighborhood of whatever it is.

Speaker 2:          00:45:20       Sometimes it a little bit of a break, a little bit of a mental break from what your experiencing the in the vibration that you exist on almost every day to separate from that and to get a look at it from the outside. Sometimes it allows you to have a renewed perspective that can enhance your life greatly as long as when people reengage the re-engaging at a level of discipline thing and this is what we share. You and I have both disciplined people and it's one of the things I really respect about you. You're a very hard worker. You're always on the ball, you're very disciplined and I know that a lot of conservative people admire that and they might hear that and folks and they think that people who are liberal are not disciplined. They think that they're lazy. It falls into this like week Beta male sort of category of people that are progressive and liberal and I think that's, I think that's a misunderstanding.

Speaker 2:          00:46:12       I think you guys, you and I both agreed that the struggle is very important, but I'd struggle physically so that I don't have to struggle mentally. I struggle physically so that I can have a better way of looking at things with less stress. So we have this shared belief that things should be a struggle. My Street, I forced my struggle on myself so that I can have a better perspective. And this is something that you and I differ on like I think you exercise, right? Yes. How often do you do it? I tried to. Every day. Yeah. Makes a big deal. It's a huge deal. Yeah. I mean I think we, we both understand that struggle is a, it's an important part of understanding yourself. If you do not push yourself, you, if you do not struggle, you're not going to really get who you are, what your boundaries are.

Speaker 2:          00:47:00       And if you're self indulgent, if everyday you're stuffing things in your face that you want to like, it's good to have a rule like, hey, for this next month you can't eat this or you can't do that or I want you to start fasting 16 hours a day. Is it that hard just eat for eight hours a day and fast for 16? But no, but that just doing something like that and setting these guidelines for yourself and putting yourself into a, uh, a discipline state could be extremely beneficial. Like Jocko Willink, he says discipline equals freedom. It is a great formula

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       and it's real. Well, it is. And again, it is the basis of a lot of religion. I mean a lot of religion is very practice based. One of the reasons I like Judaism as opposed to other religions say very practice based religion. You know, sometimes you can take that too far in one direction, which is I say you need to balance reason with with dictates, right? That are, that are meant to make you better. But that goes all the way back to Aristotle. Aristotle talks about how you have to practice to be good, right? You have to practice to be virtuous. What makes you a virtuous person is acting repeatedly in accordance with with right reason. And that is setting rules for yourself, right? That is not violating every rule. And I think when, when we talk about on the conservative side, you have folks on the left being lazy.

Speaker 1:          00:48:07       I don't mean that in terms of work. I mean, Mark Zuckerberg is a hard worker, I assume. I think Jack Dorsey, when he's not getting bitten by by mosquitoes seems like a hard worker. But you know, most, most of the people, most people love jobs are hard workers. I don't think it's about that. I think it's a, it's, it's a certain perspective on the necessity of rules and the mindset that if I don't know what a rule is for, I'm going to remove it. So GK Chesterton has this, this very famous, uh, kind of contrast that he draws between people who tend to be right wing political and people tend to be left wing politically. He says, people who tend to be left wing politically, you're walking through a, they're walking through the woods and you come across a funds. You don't know why the fence is there and you say, I don't know why this fence is here.

Speaker 1:          00:48:44       I'm removing it. And the person who's right wing walks through the forest and sees the fence and says, I have no idea why the fence is here. I'm going to go find out why the fence is here. And then maybe I'll remove it. And that's the, the kind of Burkian conservative attitude toward rules. The, the attitude that this rule was put here for a reason. Now maybe the wool socks, maybe the rule has to go, but let's try and figure out what was at the root of the rule before we just wipe out all the fences and then try to rebuild from the ground up. All these new fences. And that's especially true in a civilization that's the most prosperous in free civilization ever created. I mean, if the system really sucked, that would be one thing. But I think people are kind of ungrateful about the fact that we live in the best possible time in the best possible place.

Speaker 1:          00:49:21       Yeah, that's just, that's the reality. And everybody who's so negative about living in America, it's like, okay, in 1,901 in 10 American children died in the first year of life in 1850 the average life expectancy in Europe was an under 40 so what are you talking about? What are you talking about? Like our biggest problems today really for the vast majority of people is that we are too fat or that we are, well we don't have a job, but we still have somebody who is basically making sure we have food. Like starvation is not a serious problem in the United States. There's a problem of poverty, but there's not a problem of widespread starvation. In fact, poverty tends to align with obesity. You know, the, the state pretty unbelievably great society. So maybe you ought to look back at the roots of that society before we start Willy Nilly tearing up all of the, all of the moral boundaries.

Speaker 2:          00:50:07       I think you and I agree that this is the greatest time ever to be alive. I think what these other folks are saying is that we can do better. And I think we all agree with that, but yeah, sure. But to classify this time as being a terrible time is, I think wholly inaccurate by the way. I hit it right and left. Right. And then this is one of the reasons, yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:50:24       the reasons why. I think there's a certain point where the Trump, Ian, right meets the Bernie Sanders populace left and that is them walking around saying how much things suck. And it's like, no, no, that's just, that's just wrong.

Speaker 2:          00:50:34       So it's an amazing time. It's amazing time for communication too. It's amazing time for people to kind of understand other people's perspectives and points of view, which is one of the reasons why d platforming and uh, and silencing of conservatives, even though I'm not conservative, bothers the shit out of me. Yeah. I just think it's a, it's a, it's a non harmonious action in a time that I think could lead to people having much more open and much more balanced committee

Speaker 1:          00:51:00       occasionally. I mean this should be the time when we are having more conversations and more fun with each other and, and where we are feeling more entrepreneurial, we have a better social safety net than ever. So what one of the statistics that really bothers me is that the level of American mobility has declined rapidly in the United States and the number of people who are leaving their home state to go somewhere else to work a job, for example, is that decades low? Why? It's easier to get anywhere now there are 7 million unfilled jobs I keep hearing from, you know, folks who I personally liked, people like Tucker Carlson, uh, that, you know, we, you, you grew up in this small town and the town is dying. The industry left. Well, you had the government somehow owes it to you that you get to grow up in this town and stay in that town.

Speaker 1:          00:51:40       Even if all the industry left. And I just think to myself, by whom, who, who, who gave you this guarantee that you get to stay there? And I know, listen, I'm, I'm a lucky guy. I grew up in a two parent household. We ain't grew up wealthy but we were middle, middle class. Like I grew up in a small house in Burbank with two bedrooms and I had three sisters. Those, me and my three sisters and in one bedroom and one bathroom for six people, that's not poor. That's middleclass. That's a great life. And I understand some people don't have that life, but one thing that is guaranteed to you is the opportunity for adventure in this country. So go and move. Like why, why are we inculcating a feeling of victim hood in a society where if you make the right decisions, you will do well, I mean not you might do well if you make basic, basic right choices, you will finish better than you started in American society.

Speaker 1:          00:52:25       I mean, we're talking like the most basic choices like finish high school and don't have a baby out of wedlock and get a job like you do. Those three things, and the Brookings Institute says that you will not be in permanent poverty in the United States. Like that's amazing. That was not true for the vast majority of human history, for the vast majority of human history. You did all of those things. There wasn't high school, but you did all the other things, and then you were live like a surf on a farm until he died at age 37 of diptheria or something. So it's just the, the lack of optimism in a society where it should be running rampant is, is kind of astonishing to me.

Speaker 2:          00:52:57       Well, it's perspective, right? I mean, rich kids grow up with this perspective of constantly being rich. And people grow up with this perspective of how they view the United States as this negative thing, or that they don't know how to change their life. They don't know how to take action because they haven't had anyone around them that it's done it. And that's part of the problem with small town mentalities is that you kind of inherit the vibe of the people that are around you. And if they're ignorant or if they're, they're shallow minded or if they're, they're stuck in this one town and they're never going to leave and you get caught in that vibe, you can one day wake up and you're 32 and you've never done anything.

Speaker 1:          00:53:36       I mean this is what events talks about and Hillbilly Elegy, right? Yeah. People flourish in these small towns and they basically been told that they have two choices. They can go on welfare or they can leave. Yeah. And it's like, okay, fine. We'll go on welfare and everybody around me is why? Why not is it, there's nothing morally deficient about going on on welfare? It is actually one of the, the bigger problems I have with the welfare state generally is that it just connects the person receiving the aid from the person giving the aid one in that like in our religious community, to take an example there, there's a time a few years back where a guy came to me, I bought some art from him. He is an artist and a really does good work. He came to me and he said, my family doesn't have enough money to make the rent this month.

Speaker 1:          00:54:10       Can you offer me in advance on art that you'll buy somewhere down the road? And of course, make sure. So I sent him a check and he understood that five years later he came back to me and he said, you know, you still haven't bought that piece of art. I owe you a piece of art because he knew who gave him the money. Right, right. And so he was willing to understand that that was an act of charity and he wanted to make sure that that that was paid back. You see this in Cinderella man, right? With Russell Crowe, that moment where he makes his money, he walks back into the welfare office and he rolls out a wad. Yeah, like that, that feeling that the government isn't just a giant cash machine that is exists. You pay your money, but that money actually comes from some worry there.

Speaker 1:          00:54:44       It's coming from the future because we're going to have to pay back the debt or it's coming from somebody whose tax money and that we all owe something to each other. Right. And by the same token, the what I owe to my neighbors is that if they're in trouble, then it is my obligation as a good person to try and help them out. On a personal level. Yes. Right. And the charity and religious communities is extremely high. That's, that's the social fabric that I'm talking about. Yeah. Without, without that sort of dutiful sense to one another, you can't have rights because if you just have rights then and and no duties, then there will be no one to take care of each other. It's why while I'm libertarian, when it comes to government, I'm very conservative when it comes to the need to build a social fabric and communities and, and, and have people with working families and in communities of working families.

Speaker 2:          00:55:26       Yeah. I really think that that's one of the best things that comes out of religion is when you have a tight knit community like yours and you do have that sense of charity where you really are a community of people that care for each other and look out for each other. The problem is of course doing that large scale and then the problem is doing it and some sort of a nondenominational way where people, they don't have to have the exact same beliefs, but they still share these core values of community and taking care of each other. I mean that's what people really benefit from when they've done studies with people when they show happiness and what is happening is correlated with, it's almost always in correlated with friends and loved ones and family, right? It's the most important thing you can have.

Speaker 1:          00:56:05       And when it comes to diversity, you know, there's this slogan that diversity is our strength. Well, there is a Robert Putnam, a sociologist over at harbor. Hey, he wrote an entire book about the social fabric called bowling alone, who's kind of the, the pioneer and the idea of social capital. And what he said is that he went in with the two writing this book with the idea that diversity is our strength. And then he did some research and what he found is that ethnic diversity only correlates with two things. And these are his words, increased TV watching and increased protest marches. That's all it unless, unless it is within the boundaries of a common goal. So if you walk into a church, very diverse ethnically, everybody's got the same general goal, which is we're worshiping God and one particular way and we believe in a certain core set of values.

Speaker 1:          00:56:43       And now diversity is great. Your experience has come to bury your, you're all aiming in the same direction. He gives the example of the army. You see bunch of people who go in diverse group of people, diverse races, different backgrounds, and when you talk to those guys while they're serving or after they leave, they don't give a crap about the diverse backgrounds of the people they were serving with. They're all aiming their guns in the same direction. Well in the United States, we have to be aiming our guns in the same direction, or we can't really have a functioning social fabric at all. Like I'm perfectly willing to give charity to people who I don't know, who still believe, like I do, that America is a fantastic country rooted in immutably good principles. But that starts to break down when I'm being asked to give charity just on a personal level to somebody who believes that America is fundamentally evil.

Speaker 1:          00:57:24       It needs to be torn out at its roots and replaced with something better, right? Because now we're not aiming in the same direction. So on a human level, I care about you, but on a, but on a social level, if I have a choice between somebody who basically agrees with me about fundamental values and somebody who is diametrically opposed, I'm gonna get my money to the person who basically agrees with me on those fundamental values. And again, I don't think those fundamental values have to be religious. I don't think you have to be a god believer to receive charity from me or I don't think I should have to be, uh, an atheist receive charity from you. But I do think that you do have to take into consideration a few things and now we're on the same page, personal responsibility. The idea that you do live in a free country just historically and relatively speaking, this is a free country, which means decision making is on you.

Speaker 1:          00:58:05       So man up a little bit. They that the decisions that you make, we should all have sympathy for people who have had worse lives and worse experiences. But in the end, if you are capable, if you are not fundamentally disabled in some way that you need to make a plan for your own life and then you need to do that. Like are you more willing to give charity to somebody who has a plan for how to get themselves out of the hole? And of course, of course that, but that relies on that person feeling an obligation to do that.

Speaker 2:          00:58:30       I also think that what you're talking about with the charity within the community is so much more, there's so much more connection then charity from the government when you're talking about welfare. The problem is that there's this dissolving of responsibility because it's just a check that comes in that you feel like, wow, this is a rich country. I'm owed this anyway. The, and you know, and when I was a kid, we were on welfare and we, we used food stamps and I remember being very ashamed of it and feeling really weird that we were that poor, that we needed help from the government, but my parents worked their way out of it. They were young, they had a kid.

Speaker 1:          00:59:08       My guess is that I guess is that the, the social stigma probably has something to do with that. Meaning that I'm sure they didn't want to be on welfare and they don't want to be on food stamps. Like contrast your story with Adam Carolla's, right? Add Adam talks all the time about how his parents were also on food stamps and welfare and they just didn't give a shit. And then they were just, and he always resented that he thought that was bad. He said like, you could work, why aren't you? And that gave him the impetus to get up and do what what Adam has done. So you know that that kind of, it's not pick yourself up by the bootstrap because helping hands are good, but it is. If I, if I were capable of picking myself up by my bootstraps, would I do so? Yeah. And if the answer is yes, then we're all on the same team. Well there's,

Speaker 2:          00:59:48       this is a real problem too. And that some people just get a horrible hand dealt to them at birth. There was parents that really are doing a terrible job raising them. They're fucking him up every step of the way. You're around a bunch of people that are criminals. Everybody's fucking up. There's no examples of anybody that's doing well. I mean, it's one of the unique things about the internet today is that a kid that's in that environment can get ahold of maybe something that you've said or something that you know, someone else has said and start reading books. And start taking in information that gives them a different perspective and fueled that perspective with more motivational stuff and more information and education. And sometimes kids, just like you were saying with Adam Carolla, the grow up with these parents that are just not ambitious at all. So they become very ambitious and they worked very hard to not be like them. I mean, sometimes it's good to see that example, but most of the time it's just fucking hard for them to reprogram their heads. Right. Well

Speaker 1:          01:00:42       for sure it's hard to do that and it's also hard. I really think that there's, there's a lot of focus in the country right now on raising awareness, which is fine, you know, raise it, raising awareness of our history and all the bad things that we've done. Yeah, good. I mean people, people should know about all the good things and all the bad things, right? It's, its history is history, but this, this incessant focus on the idea that people's lives are getting better by suggesting that they're perennial victims in the United States. I just don't, I don't understand how that's a good thing. Yeah. Like, as as a historically a member of a historically persecuted group. If I had grown up and my parents had said to me, no matter what you do, you will be put under the thumb of the dominant society. That's a pretty horrible message to hell to a kid.

Speaker 1:          01:01:19       And I think that's true for politicians, again, on both sides of the aisle. I think you get it from, from president Trump when it comes to some rural areas where it's like, well, it's the Mexicans and the Chinese coming in to steal your jobs and you're under the thumb of, of people who are trying to destroy you. And on the other side of the aisle, people who say, well, you're, you're in the inner city and therefore the cops are racist against you and want to destroy you and everybody's out to get you. And it's like, well, how about this? How about like, again, the single best thing you can do for yourself is make basic decisions that are entirely within your control. Unless you are, unless you are raped, God forbid, single motherhood is a choice that you get to make about your life, right?

Speaker 1:          01:01:56       This is a choice you get to make about your life finishing high school unless you are legitimately disabled in some way. I mean especially in La Usd where you basically have to be able to read at third grade level to finish high school. You know, just just like these are, these are decisions, personal decision making if you want. I've never seen somebody life get better by complaining about reality. I've seen a lot of people's lives get better by acknowledging that reality is what it is and then making personal decisions to make their lives better and that's considered non-compassionate. But it seems to me the essence of compassion sometimes he's saying at least make the baseline decision. If you make the baseline decisions and then you'll fail, we can talk about what happened.

Speaker 2:          01:02:30       I don't think it's non-compassionate. I think it's pragmatic and I think you're right, but I also think that there's some people that are there in situations that require something external to, to assist them there, their the way their life has been set up and this is what I think when people think about compassion and people pulling themselves up by their bootstraps. If you have a real, if you really have an honest and accurate assessment of extreme poverty and terrible neighborhoods, it's not as simple as do something good to better your life. Part of it is you got to fucking stay alive, right? You're surrounded by people who either have committed crimes or we'll commit crimes. You mean one out of every four people you run into my be a criminal in the worst neighborhood in the country. Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:03:22       This is what it does for sure, but I think we have to, this is where we recognize what government is good at. Government is good at two things, cutting the other people, cutting checks from other people's money. They're great at it. And they'll see they're, they're right on top of those parking tickets by the way, to make sure that they can sign it and they're, they're amazing at it. So seizing your money and paying money, they're very good at and, and pointing a gun at people, right? These are the two things that government was built to do was collect taxes and pay out money and then point guns at people, right? This is what government does. So which of those two things would you apply in a situation where there's just a complete lack of social capital? Because cutting a check isn't going to do it alone. Where's that check? Go to the parents who are not doing, not able to protect their kids. It's one thing if you're enabling the parents who move out of that community or something. Right. Um, but that's why I say you have to attach, if you're going to do the government welfare thing, you got to attach it to a plan. It can't just be here's a check. Enjoy your life because of what is the plan.

Speaker 2:          01:04:15       No, was terrible communities. You live in an apartment complex.

Speaker 1:          01:04:18       I mean, here's the reality. I think that the plan very often when it comes to a crime ridden area is the other side of what the government does, which is you need more cops in that area. I think. I think that the great lie that though, that these communities that are crime ridden, and I'm talking about White Apalasia and I'm talking about, yes, yeah. Black inner cities. These, these communities do not need fewer cops. They need more cops because at the preconditioned to investment in those communities and increased tax dollars in those communities and increase social capital in those communities is people not getting shot every five seconds. Yeah. I mean that's why the worst thing that can happen to law abiding minorities is for the cops to abandoned areas where crime is high. It just doesn't make any sense. And that's not just me saying that Jane Levy's reporter at the La Times, very much on the left has said the same thing while biting people want crime rates to go down, like conditions have to change in a community for conditions to change in the community.

Speaker 2:          01:05:05       See The wild, uh, well the whites who wild and wonderful whites of West Virginia. No, it was, uh, it was it Johnny Knoxville. Did he produce that documentary? I think he did, right dude, it's about this family that lives in West Virginia that has just a bunch of psychotic criminals. There's these crazy white people, the kids drinking mountain dew and doing back flips on the bed and they're all on pills. It's bananas and it gives you this insight, like if you are in this community, if you were in this family, and this is obviously very extreme family, but there's many more of them out there that have not been documented. If you are in that community, good fucking luck getting out. Right. Good luck. The, the, the money that you get other than Welfare's from selling pills, you know, everybody's on these pills so you're all whacked out.

Speaker 2:          01:05:53       You don't know what the fuck is going on. Half the day you're on opiates. I mean, it is a bananas environment and there's a lot of people like that in this country for sure. And in poor Latino communities and poor white communities in poor black communities. The idea that these people are just going to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, it's crazy. I just think they don't have a plan. And I think if we really want to help them, there's gotta be some way where you can give these people the opportunity to step out of that pattern, whatever that community centers, outreach programs, whatever it is. I don't know what it,

Speaker 1:          01:06:26       I mean the truth is, the truth is that historically speaking, it was people actually going to church. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:06:32       There's a good lot of good church going person. Right. But I absolutely recognize that there's a lot of good involved and having that framework

Speaker 1:          01:06:41       right. And, and that that's, I'm not sure that that's, I don't think you can create sort of a fake social fabric with just a government welfare system. Like it just, it, it hasn't worked. I mean, disability exists. I'd been increasing every year. It's, it's not, this is a question I asked Andrew getting, actually, sorry. Our episode comes out on Sunday, and obviously Andrew is a big fan of ubi, universal basic income. And I'm not averse to the idea of ubi in a future where legitimately 50% of the population can't work because they've all been automated out of existence and all of this. But there's one section in his book where Andrew Talks about how if we cut people a check for ubi, then they will spend their extra time creating art and engaging in hobbies that they like. And I just thought to myself, I've been at said it to him like people are on disability.

Speaker 1:          01:07:23       I don't what they're doing. Right. And if you're on disability, the people you're talking about who are suffering, they're not out there writing poetry. Right. I mean the, the, the rise of the opioid epidemic and people who are oding on drugs and all this stuff that's in precisely the same demographic you're talking about. You're just talking about a check from one place as opposed to another place. I don't, I don't really see how that solves the problem. I think we have a crisis of purpose. Yes. Right now. And I don't think that that crisis of purpose is solvable on the one hand by changing our trade rules. And I also don't think that that Christ is a purpose is solvable by, by cutting a, uh, a government check. I just don't think that that's how people are wired.

Speaker 2:          01:07:59       I absolutely agree with you that there is a crisis of purpose. My concern is about automation and my concern, and obviously I haven't really studied this other than talking to Andrew Yang and talking to Elon Musk and a few other people that are proponents of universal basic income, they think that there's going to be such a massive loss

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       of jobs in such a short period of time from people that are non skilled laborers and it's going to go away. There's millions and millions of jobs and these people are not going to have anything and that it could be chaos. So there's, there's two problems that come up there and this is where Andrew's book is interesting because probably number one is that the people will be poor. They won't have a source of income. Yeah. Ubi solve that the other quarter. But does it even, it gives him $1,000 a month because he opted, right? I mean, even if, even if he just had a Swedish redistribution system and the average tax rate went up to 60% or something, it might let, let's say we could solve the money problem for a second, which, you know, without tanking the economy, which is questionable, but let's say we could do that, we could add trillions of dollars to the budget every year and we could tell that, I'm still not sure that that solves the deeper problem, which is that when people lose jobs, they lose purpose, right?

Speaker 3:          01:09:02       So I'm not sure that UBI solves that problem. As I say, we have, we have a rich social welfare network in the United States and we're seeing this stuff happen anyway. You know, I'm, I'm a little bit, I'm a little bit less catastrophic by a little bit, I mean a fair bit less catastrophic in my thinking about automation then then either Andrew Yang or Elon Musk think that people will be able to adapt quick enough to avoid the problems. They'll realize the jobs aren't there anymore. And they'll just naturally gravitate towards other professors. Anything over time that people will do that, but they're not always the same people. I, there's all these shifts in the economy and the, the ideal economic model has a truck or becoming a coder. Right. But that's, that's not reading. It was the whole learn to code fiasco kicked off of Twitter. Right, and it still does it.

Speaker 3:          01:09:41       Yeah. Apparently if you say it to journalists, then that's, that's very bad. If you say, what's a coach with truck? Yeah, that's what it was. Code to a trucker. If you say learn to code to a trucker, then that's just you being helpful. If you say learn to code to a journalist, then that is targeted harassment on Twitter. That's where that someone sends it to me. Well, I meant work. Twitter doesn't care about you. I can say whatever I want, but it's a, but yeah, I mean I think that, but if you just say it to a friend, hey fuck face learned to code that, I don't know. It's your friend could report you to the censorship board over at 20 it's such a dumb thing to take people out for. It's one of the best examples of like how censorship step oversteps its boundaries and becomes almost like satire.

Speaker 3:          01:10:20       Yeah, it's, it's real. It's really, really absurd. This is the biggest aggression ever. Learn to code. Learn to code. That's something. Look, this is a stupid thing that someone said about coal miners. They really said that about coal miners that maybe they could learn to code and so everybody, like what the fuck and so learned to code became a joke and became something that you would mock people right there. Is there an explanation for it was so crazy. It was like, no. Then learn to code got connected with this other stuff. That's the Hitler owned a dog document, right? It's like dogs are bad. Hitler owned one. Okay, white supremacists are bad. They used the phrase learned to code. That means if you say learn to code, you're a white supremacist. We lost the frog. That fucking frog. It feels good, man. Frog. That's what happened to pepe the frog. They turned the fricking fraud gay, I mean, yeah. Oh yeah. But yeah, I mean it's not as far as automation. Um, you know, there's constantly people saying this is the, the Nicholas Nassim

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       tell lead view of reality, which that the Black Swan incident can happen any, any second. So watch out for it versus the sort of Steven pinker view of reality, which is the black swan incident is called the Black Swan Internet because it's a black swan incident, meaning that it happens incredibly rarely. I, you know, the, the idea that we are on the verge of a catastrophic drop in job numbers because of the automation of trucking for example. I'm not sure that I buy it. The reason I don't buy it is because you still are gonna need someone sitting behind the wheel of that truck there human drivers on the road. Uh, it's going to, there will be a gradual transition away from some of these jobs, Andrew getting talks about radiologists and how radiologists are going to be priced out of the market by computers that can do a better job of diagnosing tumors first of all.

Speaker 1:          01:11:53       Awesome. Right. I mean that's, that's good. First of all that brings down cost end. You won't get cancer as advanced. So that'd be, that'd be a good thing. And then second of all, what, what uh, a lot of technology studies have had tended to show is that technology just gets integrated into different Wagan in particular career. So there will be jobs that are eliminated for sure. There'll be jobs we haven't heard of that will be created also. And mostly technology will, will become more of a productivity aid to, to people. So this is true in factories. Jobs have been lost in factories. It's the best example of where jobs are lost, but it's mostly turn offices, right? How many office jobs had been created because you have computers? What's more office jobs exist because I write by hand.

Speaker 2:          01:12:30       Do you think that this is akin to like a government bailout? Like the idea of the government bailout was like the banks are too big to fail and some people thought, you know what, you got to let them fail so you figure out why they failed and we'll never have it happen again. If there is this thing and the government steps in says, wait a minute, I know you lost all your jobs are going to give you $1,000 you don't have to figure it out $1,000 a month. And some people go, okay, I'm not going to figure it out now. Whereas those people might have gone on a fear filled journey to try to figure out their purpose in life because now they're stirred, stuck where their job doesn't exist anymore. So there

Speaker 1:          01:13:07       what did it their owner, I mean they have to act. There is, there is an innovation that comes from, from a welfare check. I mean there are people who become dependent on government then they're used to being dependent on government that that stuff is true. It does happen. I mean and listen, Milton Friedman made an argument for universal basic income as a replacement for the welfare system. There. There is another problem with universal basic income that I asked Andrew about also. And that was, you know, one of the, one of the big issues is that poor people, very often people who are permanently impoverished, not people who are temporarily poor, but they tend not to spend money where we think they ought to spend money, right? They're not taking that money and they're not putting it into education or into the [inaudible] Ho hos and cigarettes. The average, the average person who is making less than I think it was $16,000 a year, spending $400 here and lottery tickets or man, it's legitimately just flushing your money down the toilet know.

Speaker 1:          01:13:52       So it's so how do you, aren't you just going to end up back in the same place? You can go in six months where people took that money and used it in ways that actually didn't benefit them. And at a certain point, the question is, are your, do you own your decisions? Do, do not own your decisions and at what level of incompetence or inability do we say you no longer your decisions. And so we're just going to take care of you on a permanent basis. That's, that's really the, the, the question here. I think,

Speaker 2:          01:14:16       yeah, when you're talking about welfare, we're looking at worst case scenario, right? Where someone does get dependent upon the welfare state and does use that money frivolously and does make poor decisions. But then there's gotta be other people that are single moms that, you know, maybe had a kid with some fucking asshole. It doesn't want to pay and it is a piece of shit and they have to hide from him and they're just trying to feed their kids. Yeah. For sure. Those people exist to 100% have a community to, to, to help them out. And maybe they're not a part of a church and maybe they don't have a good group of neighbors. Maybe they had to move somewhere for work and they got stuck in some place where they don't know what study.

Speaker 1:          01:14:53       But it, I think part of this is to recognize that incentives matter on both ends. So the idea is that you give some people more money and they'll, they'll do well. It's also true that if you create a welfare system that benefit single motherhood, you will get more single motherhood. I mean, the, the single motherhood rate in the black community before welfare was 20% now it's 70% in the white community, it was like 5% now it's 40% you've said that

Speaker 2:          01:15:12       out of wedlock children and having a kid when you're young is like, it's a terrible idea for your life. But what do you recommend to have kids avoid that? Are you one of those people that thinks of it?

Speaker 1:          01:15:24       Start without that thing on it? No. Condoms. Since we were saying like, don't, don't, don't, don't have unprotected sex. I mean like this, this is not, it's not, pardon my, my fake cursing. It's not effing rocket science. I mean like, like apologizing for not curse them. Apologizing for not cursing. Uh, yeah, it's, it's, it's not rocket science. This is one the Holy Father's kids make mistakes in. I mean, that's what happens. And then if the government pays for those mistakes, it becomes less. So what should, what should happen? Should the kids suffer? So the WHO presents, should it be? Should it be worked out? I mean it depends on the situation. You know, if their parents available to the kid, presumably the parents, the grandparents would take a pretty active role in the, in the raising that kid. Awesome. They, they're there. Well, how about this?

Speaker 1:          01:16:09       How about we assume that if you are old enough to get pregnant, then you're old enough to, let's, let's talk about a 17 year old or 18 year old. Used to be shotgun marriages thing. Uh, and uh, and really like that's a good idea. I think the idea of parents staying together for the sake of a kid that they accidentally board is absolutely a good idea. Yes. I think that, I think that is a better idea than the man walking away and the kid being without a man in the house. So you're thinking of their childhood and a lot of people figure a way to work it out. Yes. And if they were both reasonable, they could do that. Yeah. And I think that that by the way, a huge percentage of American births in the forties and 50s were exactly this, or a lot of seven month babies in the forties and 50s something like 30 to 40% of all kids born in the 30s and forties and 50s we're seven months babies or would somebody got knocked up and then the expectation was nagging like you did the, you did the crime, now you do the time, right.

Speaker 1:          01:16:58       And you did this dot puts people and relationship prison good then don't then don't ask, don't die. And find somebody, find them, find somebody to have with you. Find somebody to have sex with who you actually think is worthy of a relationship right now. Or I'm on pornography is available to you. Like figure it out. You're okay with that. Um, on a moral level, yeah, no, but if I'm going to, if I'm going to compare that to having a baby out of wedlock, then yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:17:23       this is what I think about pornography. They could stop now and we're good forever. But yeah, I think you guys, there's no, there's no supply and demand problem. And they kill like Megan it. You guys are a bunch of freaks. I mean there's no, it's like a business. It's almost like you have excess houses that stack up to the moon. Like there's no way everyone's going to live in all those houses. Why do you keep making house? There's no way one person has ever jerked off to every video that ever existed. It doesn't. It's not possible. It's like, and it's also like other forms of media where they just stack up. I never really thought of that until we get the backlog of Internet pornography and you're like, cut, I'm, you know, I'm a month behind now. Just think about music, right? There's all the music that existed before in the 50s and 60s and 70s and the 80s and there's new shit every goddamn day. It never ends. It's this overwhelming library of stuff that we have. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:18:20       Dick's bucket. It would, it would be good if that music changed from time to time. Yeah. At the same song recorded seven different ways, you know? But what could, should you listen to? What do you think I listened to you today? Listen to classic jazz and classical of course. Yeah. So we just so interesting. I was, I was a concert level violinist until I was until I was like 17 years old practice. Yeah. I mean, then the only expensive object that I own other than my house is his violin. Oh really? Yeah. Is it a strata of area? It is not. It is. It is a upbeat, it's not, that's all I know. Yeah. They're the two that people may know or Stratton and like a worn area. Um, but those, those ones are like hundreds of thousands of dollars. This is in the tens of thousands of dollars. A Stradivarius is hundreds of thousands of, I had the guy who we knew, my family knew hit $1 million Stradivarius.

Speaker 1:          01:19:03       Ooh. Yeah. Now it was so big about it was the big deal. Well, I mean, aside from the historic value of the thing, they're not making any more of them. Um, it does play very differently. Very differently. Okay. I had a crappy violin for most of my, I like really until the last two years I had a violin that was handed down from my grandfather that was worth maybe 1300 bucks and it was a piece of crap. I mean, it was not a good violin. If you're good enough, then you can tell the difference between a really great violin to play and one that is a piece of garbage. And I was good enough to do that. So that's, yeah, I mean, I was a, I was a classical guy. I played, I played violin for years in, my dad was, uh, growing up, my dad was a pianist. Look at what Jamie just pulled up

Speaker 2:          01:19:42       the most expensive violin. The world sold for an estimated $16 million

Speaker 1:          01:19:49       alors Yup. For a Stradivarius and never lose value. I mean, really they don't, and this is it. This is a good investment. The person, I know this guy who has offered a, he's offered a strategy, I think it was $250,000 maybe 10 years ago. And he's like, no, that it's worth like $3 million.

Speaker 2:          01:20:04       God, no. What is the deal like what if you had to explain what's the difference between the sound that this makes?

Speaker 1:          01:20:11       I mean, it has to do with the acoustics of the instrument. Any of the wood quality. There's, there's slight variations in the construction of the instrument is certain parts of it are thicker or thinner. Um, and it is also, it's easier to play a better violin. So it, it almost covers for your mistakes. When you play a bad violin, it tends to scratch and screech more. That's why when you get in the upper register with a violin, you had very high notes. It can either be very screechy or it can be very beautiful. Some of that, a lot of, most of that's the player. Some of that's the violin Yasha Heifetz who is widely considered the greatest violinists to, to ever live. He had a Strad,

Speaker 2:          01:20:44       a lady blunt, Stradivarius cost 15 point $9 million,

Speaker 1:          01:20:49       and then they lend them out on, on loan to, you know, world's great violinist. So, but there's a button in the end. It really is the, uh, the quality of the player. There's a famous Yasha Heifetz story where he was playing at Carnegie Hall and some lady came up to him afterward and she said, you know your violin. It's just, it sounds so beautiful. And he picks up the violin and puts it to his ear and he says, Tony, I don't hear it right now.

Speaker 2:          01:21:11       So do you listen to any other kind of music? Yeah, I mean, I like some classic rock. Yeah. I mean, see, rocking out. Yeah. I, I went to a Doobie brothers concert and my parents, no, you did. Yeah, it was really, yeah. Yeah. That's, that's a band that was main named after a joint. That is true. That's how ready is accurate. I know. Did you feel like, oh, like a center. I was a rebel that day. It doesn't really go into the Doobie brothers concert with the other boomers. So the other thing is a same sex marriage. So that's the other thing that I think that we disagree with. Well, I, we agree with the marriage thing. Governments, government should be involved, I think where people should be protected is through assets. And you know, the contract. Yes. Yeah, I think that that all makes sense to me. The all that stuff in terms of like a alimony and child support and all those things make sense to me and that, and the idea that the community reinforces it, which would then become the government reinforced and all that stuff. That all makes sense to me. I understand it. But um, why do you care if a two gay guys want to get married?

Speaker 1:          01:22:13       Um, so from a religious point of view, sure. Let's go from religious soap. So you want me to do a secular point of view first? So the, the idea is not that I care deeply whether two gay guys, I want to get married to each other. The idea is that it do I prefer traditional marriage to say to same sex marriage.

Speaker 2:          01:22:29       Okay. Well let me, let me phrase it this way. What do you think a gay guy is? Do you think someone's there making a choice or do you think that this is how they were before

Speaker 1:          01:22:36       the religious point of view on this? And, and I think this is actually just the general conservative point of view. Like human action generally is, I don't know, meaning that for the vast majority of people, I would assume that they have a biological drive to engage in that behavior. But the traditional sort of we'll point of view is that biological drive does not necessarily match up to the activity you are to engage in. Right. Men, for example, have a biological drive to impregnate many women. That's not something religion is cool with either. All right, so the, the idea is that rubber

Speaker 3:          01:23:06       Lou religion is cool with a man being with one woman and impregnating her. But you're not cool with a man being with a man. So I can give you the religious explanation and I can give you the second word explanation. So they, so the religious explanation is that there is something different about a woman. Then there is about a man and a man is made better through his union with a woman and that if you pervert the sex drive to pursue mere pleasure instead of a lasting relationship upon which the base of society is built, then you are foregoing the proper use of your sex drive. And I just wanted to step in and argue against that. You would say that just because someone can't get pregnant doesn't mean that they don't have a loving relationship that contributes to society. Well, that's true, but it is also for going the more productive relationship of being able to bear and their children and also, and also recognizing that the sections are not different.

Speaker 3:          01:24:00       Right. Then recognizing also the sexes are not the same. So it, you know, being with a man is in a relationship different than being with a woman, I would assume. I mean, I assume that's why gay guys are gay. If it weren't, then I assume that they would be fine with being with a woman. Right. So that's, so that relationship from a, from a religious perspective is more valuable because women have different qualities than men. You round off each other's harsh edges. It changes you. I mean, you're married being very changes a man in a different way, that being married to a member of the same sex would write. But I don't want people to have to do it. But if you're not forcing anybody, right, but I want them to have the option and if you're a gay person and we know, I mean of course because legally we agree, right?

Speaker 3:          01:24:41       Yeah. Illegal. And I keep making this distinction because whenever I talk about my moral perspective on things, then people immediately assume that I'm a theocratic fascist and I just want to keep underscoring my personal views on Dave Rubin's marriage are of no consequence to public policy in any way whatsoever. But I agree with you on that and I don't think it should be a part of public public policy and I think people should absolutely be allowed to marry and divorce and do whatever the fuck they want to do no matter who it is. But why do you care? Like as a person who's a rational thinker, it's pretty clear that people are gay and I don't really think that this is a decision they make in term in terms of like, I'm going to make a clear choice to defy God and be gay. I think they're just gay.

Speaker 3:          01:25:24       Well, again, I think that's a confession. It's a conflation of identity. And drive with activity, which is something that religion fundamentally reject. Religion fundamentally rejects the idea that you are driven to do something and therefore it is your identity. Therefore, he gets to participate in the behavior. That's it. That's a chain of thinking that religion, any religion, if a man is gay in your religion, if a man is gay and they're in love with another man, they should just squash those thoughts and find a woman. Well, ideally they would be honest with a woman they marry and they're not like, well, they would want to. Ideally, ideally, you would still get married and have children in a heterosexual relationship. If you're not up to that, then you wouldn't get married at all to when you describe this to a

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       gay man, they will tell you, imagine Ben Shapiro, someone said to you, you should stop being with your beautiful wife and you need to now marry a man because this is what God wants you to do, so you're going to have to stop this man and he's going to stop you because this is how the rules are set up so far. It sounds pretty terrible shirts, right? Well, this is how it sounds to gay folks when you're telling them they have to find a one.

Speaker 1:          01:26:27       Like I like, I'm not saying you have to find a woman. I'm saying, I'm saying you can't do X. Right? I'm not saying you must, but say can't. But by whose determination? If you decide to participate in this religion, right? Then there is a buyin to the precepts of the religion

Speaker 2:          01:26:43       and the buy in is

Speaker 1:          01:26:44       you can't be gay. Well, no, the buy in is that you can have whatever sexual orientation you pleased, but there's certain activity you can't participate in.

Speaker 2:          01:26:50       So you can be gay, but you can't have gay sex.

Speaker 1:          01:26:54       Correct. That's the, and by the way, that's what the Bible, I mean, if we want to go direct to the text of the Bible, it's what the Bible actually says, right? I mean, even the parts of the Bible that people really hate those parts say that a man shall not lie with a man. It doesn't say a man can't be attracted to another man. That's old testament. Right? Yeah. Right. That's our stuff. Right. New, the new testament that it gets a little harsher and the new testament in some places, Romans, correct? Yeah. But in any case, you know, uh, again, when it comes to, this is what I'm puzzled by is the idea that this is a unique area of human behavior that religion is supposed to treat differently. Meaning religion treats virtually every human activity like this, sin is a failure to abide by a covenant, right?

Speaker 1:          01:27:32       That's what, that's the definition of sin, right? When when you commit a sin in Judaism, in era in Judaism, what you are doing is failing to do a Mitzvah, which is a commandment. You're violating a commandment. Well, there are lots of commandments that go directly against what people are driven to do. Just because of the drive is stronger, does not make it morally more morally non culpable to violate that commandment. So when people pick this one out and they say, well, this one is particularly intolerant for example, uh, I don't see why it's more particularly intolerant than saying to a man that you have to marry one woman or saying to a Jew that you are not allowed to eat this stuff. Or you know like it's, it may be harder that I don't think there's any question. It's harder to abide by those commandments, but it is well within religious tradition, like literally every religious tradition that there's a bunch of stuff you are driven to do that you can't.

Speaker 1:          01:28:19       Now again, you don't have to agree with my program that I'm not trying to convert you. It's one of the nice things about my religion. I don't give a crap whether people are Jewish or not. Like we, we actively discouraged converts. But if you're going to proclaim that you are abiding by traditional Judaism, this is the buy in, right? There's lots of buy and you have to wear a funny hat. Sometimes you have to, you have to go to shul on Saturdays. You have to keep Shabbat. Like there's, there's a lot of buy in and as long as I'm not bothering anybody else, I, I frankly don't see what business it is legitimately anybody's what I think about personal relationships. I'm not imposing my view on anybody else.

Speaker 2:          01:28:51       Well, um, I, I do acknowledge that at all, all the religions, Judaism probably makes it the most obvious. They don't give a fuck what do, go ahead. Do your thing. Like they're not trying to ties, you're doing your business. My uncle converted and uh, when he get very, it was a grind man. He had to learn a lot of Shit

Speaker 1:          01:29:09       my three years of a grind. A long time. Yeah, for sure. It's a long time. So that was the religious perspective and the, and the secular perspective when it comes to valuing traditional marriage over over a same sex marriage, that's a very simple calculation, which is one type of marriage produces traditional children produce his children need traditional biological way and then you have both parents in the house to take care of the kid. Right? That's the value of marriage. And I fully acknowledge that when the value of marriage shifted from, it's about production and rearing of children too. It's two people who love each other. The case for same sex marriage against same sex marriage went completely out the window.

Speaker 2:          01:29:40       Right, so you are just sticking to your rigid ideology in terms of like what you believe to be a sin and not believe to be a sin based on your religion, based on this very strict moral fiber that this religion is

Speaker 1:          01:29:55       in a religious context. It applies to me, it applies to my family. It doesn't apply to you. Right.

Speaker 2:          01:30:00       Room for growth in that when people have a better understanding about biology like it, if it was proven, if there's proven like, oh, this is why a person develops blue eyes. This is why a person is gay. This is why there's nothing wrong with it. It's just a very ocean. It's red hair, it's freckles, it's gay, it's straight.

Speaker 1:          01:30:21       Tell me that that homosexual orientation is 100% biologically driven and I will almost completely agree with that. I think that there are some cases where it's not, but those are rare. But it's particularly true by the way. The research tends to show that there's more sexual fluidity among females than males. Males. It tends to be either heterosexual or homosexual. Research is all done by dudes want their wives to hook up with chip, keep going. Don't tell him to stop you, but hey, let me just show you the paperwork. But it's wrong. But again, that it's a, it's a question that I've always found actually not particularly interesting simply because it doesn't take into account the worldview generally, which is that a biological drive does not equal excuse for behaving in a certain way.

Speaker 2:          01:31:03       But this, that's where it brings me back to this, like is it possible that these laws in this religion were written when there, what do, who do you think wrote the stuff? Do you think people wrote the stuff or do you think God really,

Speaker 1:          01:31:14       I think either way, even if it were it. I mean, because I am a an orthodox Jew, I believe that at the very least it's God inspired and God written. Right? But even if I believed out a second level that human beings were at that stuff too. I think that people 3000 years ago had never seen a gay person before were saying tenanted. Like the very reason to have a commandment is because certain people in your community are behaving in a particular way, presumably. Right? There's no commandment not to take your head and shove it into meat grinder.

Speaker 2:          01:31:39       Well, this is also the argument against pork is because they didn't understand trick gnosis thinner stand. You have to cook the meat to 145 degrees and pork parasites, which are very dangerous for people.

Speaker 1:          01:31:49       I'm not, I'm not a huge fan of naturalistic explanations for religion. Do I think that's a good one though for pork? I mean, I don't know. Like I think you could make an argument that

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       died in India and there's horrific x rays of his head. He had a parasites from pork that had gotten into his body and they had a nested in his brain, started developing all these cysts inside of his head and they couldn't do anything about it because it was so deep in his head that if they gave him the antivirus antiparasitic medication, it would cause swelling of the brain and they will be like, it was, it was so far gone. Tell the story. It's actually pig shit. Apparently the people accidentally coming in contact with pig shit produces this particular type of parasite. Yeah, it's kosher. It's more rare but, but trick Kenosis was pretty good

Speaker 1:          01:32:40       like a long time. There are attempts to sort of paint back into the Bible certain rationalistic explanations like those where it makes sense though, I think.

Speaker 2:          01:32:50       Why else would you, would it be bad? Eat pigs, like Jesus loves pigs. Is that what's going on?

Speaker 1:          01:32:55       Uh, well, I, I think that the reversal of the kosher laws in the New Testament, you know, from, from a Jewish point of view where we don't believe in the divinity of Christ. There you can make an argument that the, the Gospels, which were written, he was just taking off it and significant, no, no, no, we don't even believe he's a prophet. What do you think he was? What do you guys think? I mean, I, what I, what do I think that he was historically, I think he was a Jew who tried to lead a revolt against the Romans and got killed for his trouble. Just like a lot of other Jews at that time who were crucified for trying to lead revolt against the Romans

Speaker 2:          01:33:19       for their trouble. So he became legend and story and it became a bigger and bigger deal as time went on

Speaker 1:          01:33:25       for followers. And then that gradually grew. And then do you think that says a wreck? No, that's not, that's not a, uh, Jewish belief. Okay. I just want to check. Yeah, no, or we're not into, you know, not the marquee stories. No, that's not to have any miracles. No, not, not, not by Jesus. And then there was the old testament. Yeah. You've gotten most of splitting of the sea and all that. What do you think happened there? What do I think happened there? Yeah. Well I'll go into my mind at ease and explanation that there was a, I mean it says in the Bible there was a strong east wind. Ah. So there was a naturalistic explanation for a physical phenomenon. That makes sense. I mean, that's, so that's what my mind needs is constantly trying to do is read nature back into the Bible.

Speaker 2:          01:34:00       Hmm. Yeah. That, that is the problem with these texts, right? Is it, you're trying to decipher translations from original tax, which are written in ancient Hebrew thousands of years ago and were told an oral tradition for longer than that. Right,

Speaker 1:          01:34:13       right. I mean this is, this is where, you know my, my book, which I always hesitate to pitch my own stuff because it sounds Gauche pitch away, but the new book, the right side of history and Number One New York Times bestselling nonfiction book

Speaker 2:          01:34:23       mate, you got number one and the New York Times bestselling fee.

Speaker 1:          01:34:27       Yeah, we sold enough that we knocked Michelle Obama out of the number one slot for a week. So that was nice. Is there a protest? Uh, well, no protest yet, but suffice it to say the New York Times book review or didn't like it, but I'm not super shocked by that. But the basic contention that I make is that Judeo Christian values on the one hand and then human reason on the other Greek reason really that that tradition is attention and that that tension is where western civilization lives. That basically civilization is a suspension bridge. It takes certain fundamental precepts of Judeo Christian values, the one hand and then takes Greek reason and they're pulling against each other. And sometimes reason feels like it's going to dominate religion. And sometimes it feels like religion is going to dominate reason and the best of all available worlds. You have a bridge that is, that is capable of building upon that where you can actually have a functional civilization and if you lose reason in the name of theocracy, then you end up with tyrannical theocracy and if you lose, if you lose religion in the name of reason, you end up in some pretty dark places because human beings don't have a very good track record of creating their own purpose, creating their own meaning, creating their own systems.

Speaker 1:          01:35:30       We tend to get very utopian very quickly. Right, and things get really ugly, which is sort of the story of the, particularly the first half of the 20th century.

Speaker 2:          01:35:37       So this is the benefit of sticking to the rigid ideology that's prescribed by religion is that you don't allow the human beings to keep updating it and changing it. Because if you do, they will eventually slide into chaos.

Speaker 1:          01:35:48       The yes, but there's there, which is not to say there's not playing in the joints. There's certainly, religion has morphed over time of Judaism as it was practiced originally. Probably in many ways, does not resemble Judaism is practiced now. Right? In fact, the Talmud even says this, I mean there's, there's this kind of fascinating and counter intuitive section of the Talmud where Moses is, it's, it's uh, what is called the [inaudible], which some of these stories that are just kind of put into the, into the middle of the Telmate where Moses comes back and he's watching from on high as a bunch of rabbis in, you know, second century Palestine, uh, are, are talking about Judaism. And he's like, I don't recognize any of this stuff. Like I brought down these books from the mountain and I do not recognize any of this stuff. And, and God says to him, you know, God says to him, right?

Speaker 1:          01:36:34       I mean, this is how this has morphed in Moses is pleased. In other words, he's, he's not, Judaism has always had a common law tradition where you're using reason to try and develop the ideas behind the commandments and then try and extend them or broadened them. And I think that's a good thing, but you have to be careful not to completely undermine fundamental routes or or get rid of basic precepts. In other words, you have to, you have to acknowledge there are certain fundamental truths that exist there and then there's play as far as how those are implemented. Does Judaism have one of those?

Speaker 2:          01:37:04       Pray the gay away traditions?

Speaker 1:          01:37:06       No, that's not it. That's not a thing. I mean it's what do they want guys to do? Like what say, what would you do if not not to, not to sin, but again soon as a soon as a thing that everybody does. Meaning that masturbation is not, is not okay. According to Judaism, I assume that a vast majority of young Jewish men, even the Orthodox are masturbating. So people sit in. I mean that's, that's a recognition. It's, it's always, again, I think I can speak on behalf of, I will audaciously speak on behalf of both Jews and Christians here. I think that religious people are, are told that when they say that something is a sin, this means that they are looking askance at the people who are committing the sin. And that is not correct. I mean, what Judaism and Christianity say is that we are all committing sins on a fairly regular basis. Where we get uptight is when people start saying, because I have a desire for the sin, the sin is no longer a sin. Hmm.

Speaker 2:          01:38:00       Yeah. The real problem is like what? Why is it a sin a who says it's a sin? So again, who again, this these rules you were assuming or influenced by God, right? But clearly written by people.

Speaker 1:          01:38:13       Well, the, this one you would say if you're a fundamentalist or at least somebody who believes in the, the idea that the Torah was given by God was giving literally by God. But again, that doesn't the, the logic behind the rules, which you know, people like my monities have tried to explicate. The idea is, as I said a second, this you can do without God, right? This part you can without God, the human sex drive was made to procreate within a stable relationship in order to pro generate and have future generations of people misuse of that sex drive in any way. Whether you're talking about from masturbation to homosexual activity is therefore a diminishment of the use of that drive. That's the natural law case against, against homosexual activity. And again, I will reiterate for media matters for the 1000000th time, I'm not in favor of any of this being encoded into American law because freedom is freedom. People should be able to send how they choose so long as they're not harming anybody else.

Speaker 2:          01:39:04       Right? No. But what about people that have had vasectomies and what about women that also Judaism is not cool with this? Ectomies not cool with it, but neither is Catholicism from what I understand. Right, right. Yeah. Well, I'm not a big fan of that one, even though when I have more experience with, but uh, so if, what if a man is sterile and the woman's sterile or they're allowed to have sex because they both know.

Speaker 1:          01:39:28       So yes, because there are ancillary benefits to married couples having sex, like relationship building. Right, but that's not a generalized case against the favored view of sex. Right. It's sort of like arguing that intersex people mean that there's no such thing as two separate sexes. There aren't two separate Texas and also their intersex people who have a condition. That's the same thing here. The case in favor of heterosexual sexual activity does not change based on the fact that some people can't actually participate in that.

Speaker 2:          01:39:55       What would you do if a young gay guy came to you for advice? If someone said, hey, Ben, a, I'm an admirer of yours. I love the way you think and fall your philosophies, but I've got a problem. I'm a young Jewish man and I'm gay and I don't know what to do. What would you tell them to do?

Speaker 1:          01:40:12       I mean, I can't tell them to do anything.

Speaker 2:          01:40:16       When would you advise, would you tell? Would you tell him to not act out on those feelings?

Speaker 1:          01:40:20       I would say you do the best you can as a human being. And from my moral perspective, you tried to avoid sin as best you can, but everybody sins.

Speaker 2:          01:40:30       The problem does that sin though it seems to me that it was defined by people that didn't understand biology because they were dealing with humans that existed thousands of years ago with no books. No understanding of why people were gay.

Speaker 1:          01:40:43       No, I mean I again, I, I really don't think that biblical commandments are linked and religious commandments generally are linked to a view of biology. Meaning that you don't think so? No. I think that sin is a recognition that we have drives that we are supposed to forego. Okay. That's pretty much, I mean that's, that's fundamental to certainly Judaism to Christianity as well. I would say Islam even has, has this basic preset, right?

Speaker 2:          01:41:05       Right. When I think we can agree that there's some real benefits to discipline, there's real benefits to having structure and it doesn't mean that you can't be creative. It doesn't mean that you can't be free and do whatever you want some of the time too. But I think we can both agree that this is one of the, one of the best benefits of an ideology and what hopefully a positive ideology. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:41:26       Right. And one of the things that I, the reason I keep coming back to the governmental regulation point is because my view is that if your view of discipline is not my view, discipline good on you. Right? Like go, go do what you want to do. Like I've never had a conversation with Dave Ruben about, about him being a gay guy. Right. But you did say that you like wouldn't go to his marriage. Right? Well, I said right. As a, as a religious person, I can't say I can't actively participate in something that I consider to be a sin, but I would go out to dinner with Dave and his husband anytime, like my wife and I would do that. Of course we'd have him over to our house with his husband.

Speaker 2:          01:41:55       There's no, you don't find any contradiction between your religious perspective and your personal perspective in that regard that you would do, you wouldn't be there for religious reasons, but that you would be there for personal reasons. Like if it wasn't, would you go to the after party? I'll give, you wouldn't go to the wedding. Would you go to the APP?

Speaker 1:          01:42:13       Bart? Anything that was a celebration of same sex marriage now.

Speaker 2:          01:42:17       Wow. So anything but like if we go to the party. No, I mean that's it and that's it. I mean there's a barbecue the next day, et cetera. You know, it's, it's,

Speaker 1:          01:42:28       and again, like I'm not sure why I'm not a good party person, so I'm not sure why anybody would want me to write

Speaker 2:          01:42:33       party. Frankly. Scary. But haven't been to a party with you. But I went to a dinner party with you. That's true. We had a great time. That was a good time. That was good times. That's a funny picture, man. That is why I don't know what the fuck to think about that picture. And it's certainly true. Eric and Jordan and you and I. It's like what white supremacist in one place right now. All the, yeah, that that is a disturbing one when they'll just just lump you in with a bunch of fucking psychopath just because it's convenient for them and it's an easy way to diminish you that that that is a, that is a thing that I see more from the left then from the right and it's really disturbing. I always thought until this clickbait generation came along, I always thought that especially, well, you know the New York Times is obviously the higher standard, but that you would never see that kind of shit from progressive people. You would never see willful distortion of reality to define their narrative and it's a really disingenuous way and it happens so often now that people get called my favorite is alright adjacent. I know what that means. It doesn't, they don't know what it means. That's a new thing. It's a new thing. People try it out to try to not, it might go away.

Speaker 1:          01:43:48       It's, it's again trying to lump everybody into group for purposes of castigating. Their motives is really about this. You don't have to have an argument with somebody if you assume they're naughty. So I guess you could call everybody a Nazi. You don't have to have an argument.

Speaker 2:          01:43:58       It is goofy. But you know, I think when it comes to the, the gay marriage thing, what people really worry about is other people trying to stop people from doing what they want to do. You don't have that in you. That's not you. What you are doing is opposing it from your, your religious beliefs.

Speaker 1:          01:44:19       Right? Like if you want to join into my shoal that she'll has religious beliefs and that's their business by the way, there like I can't join a church. I assume. I don't believe the things that people in the church believe

Speaker 2:          01:44:30       you probably could just donate. You got to give the right amount of money.

Speaker 1:          01:44:34       Well, I don't believe in the Jesus. So there's that. There's that, that's not my thing. Right. I mean, so that's, I wouldn't expect to walk into a mosque and expect them to change their, their standards on religion. I find it really audacious when people actually expect other people to view the world the same way that they do and then expect that they're going to be catered to in that way. Like I wouldn't walk into a, I wouldn't walk into a gay owned bakery and expect them to bake a cake that has versus from Leviticus on it. Like why would I do or

Speaker 2:          01:45:03       weird story, you know, I'm the big cake store cause it gets bandied about. They, those folks went to several Baker's until someone said

Speaker 1:          01:45:11       no, this is correct. They were looking for a court case and yeah, honestly like that's not you being a civil rights here that you being a jackass, seriously. Like go to the other bakery. What did these people do to you? They didn't have anything to do with you. They don't owe you their cake. And if you want to boycott, then boycott them. Right? You want to get all your friends to say we're not going to go buy a cake from these discriminatory humans. Fine. It's a free market have at it. But this, this notion that somebody owes you their services, that's that to me it's not even a freedom of religion case. To me that one's a freedom of association case.

Speaker 2:          01:45:39       Well, I think what the goal is is to shame a business into submission and also to, to put it out there in the public eye so that people understand that this is the discrimination that does happen with gay folks. Will, they will go somewhere and someone won't bake a cake for him, you know? And so I think they wanted to highlight it. So if I was being very charitable and w I didn't think there'd be an attention whores, I would say maybe that's what they're doing. Maybe they're just trying to highlight this very real problem.

Speaker 1:          01:46:06       That's fine. But they actually like took it to the government. Once he starts pointing government gun to people, I get real uptight. So again, if that's a weird one, if you were, if you were just to walk into yeah, right, exactly. Yeah. Right. Talk about how much you don't like them. Fine. You know, like I, I may disagree with you or I may agree with you, whatever. That's, that's fine. But once you start going to the government and having the government levy like hundred thousand dollar fines on family bakeries because they, because you couldn't find a gay baker in Colorado supposedly like, um, no, I'm sorry. That's, that's not cool. And I feel the same way. If I walked into a bakery and they're like, you're Jewish, we're not serving you. I'd be like, okay, you're, you're in a hole. But all right. I mean it's free country and there's a bakery across the street. Or maybe I'll just open a bakery next door to you and take your business.

Speaker 3:          01:46:50       Well, it's

Speaker 2:          01:46:52       unfortunate that anyone would ever think like that, but should it be a law to force someone to think differently? You can't, it doesn't work.

Speaker 3:          01:47:00       Work. This isn't it. This is my point. Is it just a slippery to my religious beliefs and be like, oh, you're a theocrat and I keep coming back to I'm not though. Like I don't want to force my beliefs on anybody. Just have those books are my beliefs. So leave me alone and those are your beliefs, so leave you alone. And if we can't have a system where we acknowledge that those beliefs can coexist and we can still have conversations with each other or be friends, it's gonna be real hard to have a society. When you told Dave Rubin that you wouldn't go to his wedding, did he get butthurt? No Pun intended. No, he wasn't upset about it now. No. Cause it, cause Dave and I were friends. He knows that I have no anger or upset about him doing. I would want every month, Fuck Ben.

Speaker 3:          01:47:37       Come on man. I Dunno. I'm not a friends person so I don't have any friends. I mean I have friends, but it's like very close friends and then acquaintances. I tend to keep a pretty close social circle. That's smart. They have so much time in this life that that's pretty much how I feel. Like if you're the kind of person where it feels like a true obligation for me to drive you to the airport. Oh, not a thing, man. I'm not driving. Correct. Correct. There are people who make money off of you driving to the airport. It turns into that this is, this is exactly correct that those people, but that does, that kind of went away for the most part. So if you find someone who still ask him for a ride to the airport, that's a greedy motherfucker at this point. You know, it wasn't your 30 bucks on the Uber, like your wife or your girlfriend and she wants to talk to you when you drop her off at the airport. That's totally cool. Right? Well this is a standard, but that's what I mean by that. I circle of friendship like somebody where I'm in the car with them for half an hour and it doesn't feel like an obligation or a nice conversation, then that's fine. But um,

Speaker 2:          01:48:34       I value community and I, I value our value. People talking and trying to understand each other. And I, I've seen so much conflict that's unnecessary because I see so much conflict that's rooted in people not communicating. And instead of communicating, and I think this is one of the things that I'm most nervous about with all this deep platforming and censoring people and the silencing of people on the right. And it's not that I agree with these people, it's that I see how this is just going to shore up these two sides and it's going to make it a much more difficult, much more difficult atmosphere for communication, for real understanding and coming to agreements on things and and recognizing the things that we all, all good people seem to agree. You could try, you should try to help each other. She'd be kind to each other. You should work hard, you should have good morals and ethics. You shouldn't steal, you shouldn't take from, people shouldn't lie, you shouldn't try to cheat the government. You shouldn't try to cheat people. Just be a good fucking person. And that this, this transcends religious ideologies. It transcends political leanings. It really does. And it should. And we can have a truly diverse community, truly diverse, not forced diversity, diverse

Speaker 1:          01:49:47       meaning some people are progressive, some people are conservative, some people who are libertarian. You can joke with each other. We can all get along together and disagree with things. Just not be fucking hateful towards each other. This is possible, but it, it becomes less possible when people feel like they're being silenced or sensors. Totally right. And it's also true that when you, when you castigate somebody is morally on equal, what you're really doing is you're giving you an excuse to get into their shit. I mean, it was like this is what's really happening here. Like if I had a slogan beyond the facts, don't care about your feelings stuff. He'll just leave me alone. Yeah. Right. Don't get into my shit. Like I'm not bothering you, so why are you bothering me? And if I have a belief system that's different than yours, then so the hell, what? As long as I'm not bothering you, what difference does it make to you? How I feel about things? The only thing about the

Speaker 2:          01:50:31       gay thing is that it's not you. You have a belief about things that's not you.

Speaker 1:          01:50:36       But I have lots of beliefs about things that are not me, right? But there are people that aren't hurting each other. But it's so what, I mean, I can believe that people who aren't hurting each other, like I'm not a fan of prostitution. So like, so I am not a fan of people. Here's some, somebody got hurt. Prostitution's clearly more of a choice than I think gay people are. Okay. But I'm, I'm right. But I know you're coming back, coming back to the same moral distinction which I've ever repeated a few times, which is that I'm not a believer that a natural desire to do something therefore makes an activity. Okay. But that's, but that's a view that has no extra Alli's, my view has no externality. So in the same way, listen, I believe about people who eat too much and get obese because they eat too much.

Speaker 1:          01:51:15       I think it's a bad thing to do. I do think it's my business. You want to do it your problem. Like you want to, you want to eff up your life. That's what freedom is called, right? Isn't it one of the seven deadly sins. Gluttony. Yeah. That again, a question thing, but yeah, but, but yes, I mean, and I have, I've lots of beliefs about lots of things that people do. And by the way, so to you, things that don't affect you, right? I, and this is, we all do, but as long as I'm not forcing that on you because there are no externalities, true behavior, I don't see why it bothers you. Like they're legitimately, I would assume tens of millions of people in this country who believe that when I die I will go to hell. Right. And I don't know. I don't believe in Jesus.

Speaker 1:          01:51:49       And so there are a lot of people believe I don't believe in Jesus, therefore I am bound for hell. That does not bother me. One, I Yoda cause no one's bothering me. So what do I care? Right? Like I don't understand why everyone doesn't take this view. If I'm not legitimately bothering you, why should, why should you care what I think like this is, this is what would be puzzling me if somebody came to me and they wanted my opinion on something because they valued my opinion that much. I give my opinion, but it's a f you don't have to care about my opinion

Speaker 2:          01:52:14       sync when it comes to the gay thing where people are looking for is to people for other folks to be accepting of who they are and I think for a lot of these gay folks had been in the closet their whole life. That's the big things. They're always worried about someone treating them differently or someone diminishing them because they're gay. Then when they hear someone like you say that you think it's a sin and that you shouldn't act on your biology, even though you have these urges that you should instead find a woman, they feel the same pangs. Rejection

Speaker 3:          01:52:46       that I for sure get that, but the, the confluence between activity and identity is actually kind of a dangerous one meeting. Then the, you know, the, the idea that if I disapprove of an activity in which you engage, that I disapprove of you. Right. I disapprove of lots of activities in which lots of people engage, including most members of my family, including my children and a lot of the time that's not me. I just approve of them as a human being or that I'm di I'm saying they are lesser as a human being that like we all interact with people this way. Like you disapprove of my view on this. I don't get the feeling you disapprove of me as a human being. No, I don't practice a religion. You obviously think of my religion is bullshit, but that's okay. I don't care. Like why was, I don't think it's bullshit.

Speaker 3:          01:53:27       I wouldn't say, I think it's bullshit. You can still like God spoke to somebody in the mountains. Bullshit. Right? Well I don't even know if that's bullshit. What I do know is that it's a historical interpretation of stories that were as much as they could or as little as they want it to be accurately defined and written down and then passed on from generation to generation. For example. You think the fact that I won't eat pork is kinda stupid bullshit. No, I don't think it's stupid bullshit. First of all, I think pigs are intelligent. I wish they weren't wild. I have a deep affinity to pigs and really good example here. I love them. But I also kill them and eat them. I mean, I kill wild pigs. Let me be broader about this. You're not an orthodox Jews, so I assume there are things about the things that I do, but I, there are certain things of which I believe or practice that you, that you probably disapprove or you don't think they're the smartest or you think that there might not think is the smartest.

Speaker 3:          01:54:20       But as I've gotten older and hopefully wiser, I give a fuck less about why you do what you do, but whether or not the benefits seem to be worth the juice is worth the squeeze. Right. And in your case, I think the juice is worth the squeeze. I think you're a very successful person. You're very reasonable. You're very intelligent. You're an outstanding debater. And I enjoy talking to him, listening to on Youtube. Um, I think part of that is because of the fact that your religion, right? Of your religious, I think it's cross training. I think in a lot of ways it's like if you lift weights for Jujitsu, it makes you stronger. Don't make your Jujitsu better as long as you keep training. I think your discipline from your religion has, there's psychological benefits to it. Right? Or is that totally benefits to it?

Speaker 3:          01:55:09       I totally get all that. That gets to the point. The point is that we're different people. So there are certain activity in which I engage that you probably think, well that's, I wouldn't do that to kind of dumb and that's okay. I don't, I wouldn't though. I would, but I wouldn't, I wouldn't, I don't want to do it. I don't want to wear a Yamaka. Right. I get it. I understand why you would do it. Hard to keep it on your head. Just glue it. What would it called zoots do they put up double stick tape there? You can not allow it to now. You can. You totally can. But it seems to be painful and uncomfortable. Yeah. Um, definitely says that. And living in a society, we all are constantly disapproving of each other. Right? Politics is just us disapproving of each other all the time. And so long as we're not forcing that on anybody else. I really

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       don't see the problem. And I think everybody should sort of get over it. Like if I don't approve of your personal behavior, welcome to the club. I disapprove of 99% of people's personal behavior, including my own habits.

Speaker 2:          01:55:53       Do you, how, how often do you debate people on the merits of religion or the merits of your beliefs?

Speaker 1:          01:55:58       Um, you know, not, not super frequently, but not infrequently. I mean, like I, I mentioned that I've, I've had this conversation with Sam a couple of different times in public.

Speaker 2:          01:56:07       Well, he's, he's so rabid as an atheist.

Speaker 1:          01:56:10       He's my religion. Sam is more religious than I am. Sam. Sam is more of a religious atheist and I am like, I'll admit questions about my own religion. Sam is very, very convinced of his, of his correctness and in his viewpoint, Sam Sam's a religious dude. He's a fascinating guy. I liked him a lot. And again, and Michael Shermer, uh, I've had on my show to talk about religion and skepticism and all that. I'm not shy about talking about it. I just, sometimes I find that it's, it's kind of a dead end because sometimes it just turns into I believe in God and then the person's like, I don't believe in God. And it's like, well, okay, fine. Now. Now can we talk about the stuff we think are the, what are the fundamental building blocks upon which you can basis society or basic politics? And if we agree on those, then you know, the God stuff, I think God is a better base for those fundamental policies and, and, and belief systems.

Speaker 1:          01:56:56       I think free speech, individualism, democracy, these are based on a simple verse in Genesis that human beings are made in God's image. I think that that's a logical leap. This is the case I've made to it, to see him. I don't think that you can actually get to human beings are of inestimable inestimable value from scientific materialism. If you believe that human beings are effectively just animals, then I don't know why they would be of infinite value, nor why I should respect somebody's belief system simply because they're human and I don't respect animals. And if we're just another animal, I, there's no, there's nothing that necessitates that logical line of the, in fact, for most of human history, it was not the logical line of thinking it was, if you're a member of my tribe, then we like you, and if you're not a member of my tribe, then we'd get to kill you.

Speaker 2:          01:57:36       A logical comparison like is isn't there a difference between single celled organisms and the way a primate interacts with its environment?

Speaker 1:          01:57:43       I mean, yes, but I'm not sure why that would indicate any sort of greater existential value.

Speaker 2:          01:57:48       It's not necessarily a greater existential value, but as we were talking about the value of community and the value of having a group of people that you care about that this is, this is a core component of being human. This is a, it's a core component of this understanding mind, rational, intelligent, interfacing with the universe in a way that no other animals capable.

Speaker 1:          01:58:10       I'm not saying you can't get to the point where Sam agrees with me. I'm saying that I think it's less convincing than Sam thinks it is. Meaning, there's an alternative line of thought that says, okay, you're right, social fabric is great, you know, or that social fabric is particularly awesome among me and my friends. I know where it ain't that great. Those guys over there, let's go kill him and take their shit. I'm really like that. That was pretty much how humanity works for very, very long time. Uh, and the simple and effective idea that the reason that human beings are of value is because we are more than just our material bodies. That there's something that is us that is of inestimable value. That's a religious concept and it has a lot of weight. Now, if Sam wants to get to the same place and we can build a political conversation from there, that's fine.

Speaker 1:          01:58:49       My real argument was Sam is Sam and I go down to the bottom of the iceberg about 90% of the way we have the same fundamental values about free speech, diversity of opinion about I think two, two mostly an extent free markets. Uh, you know, I think that we agree on a lot of these fundamental principles. He then says that he gets those from pure reason. I have serious questions about whether pure reason necessitates those conclusions. He tends to think that those are the only conclusions a reasonable person could come to if you properly apply a reason. I don't think that's right. What do you think is happening there? What's the mechanism? I think that the mechanism is that we are common. What I said to Sam when we were debating this in San Francisco is it's real weird. He's a materialist, scientific materialist atheist who is sitting across the stage.

Speaker 1:          01:59:33       For me, a religious Jew, we agree on 95% of our values. So how, and his answer was, well, you know, here's where I've studied. I've studied Buddhism, I've studied these philosophies and I've studied science and all this. Is that right? I haven't studied a lot of those things, but we have the same value. So why it seems to me a better historical explanation is that we have grown, we grew up 10 miles from each other in Los Angeles after 3000 years of common history of Judeo Christian development, balanced with reason in the west. Like location has something to do with this. And that location was rooted in commonality of interest in philosophy. So I, I'm less, it's, it's, there's a weird nexus and I don't want to get to kind of deep in the weeds here. There's a weird kind of nexus on what truth is. Uh, the where you've heard Sam and Jordan Peterson debate us.

Speaker 1:          02:00:19       It was insane. It was, it's wild, right? Um, and the truth is, I'm closer to Sam than Jordan on this, so I'm closer to Jordan than Sam when it comes to the value of religion. And I'm closer to Sam than Jordan. When it comes to objective truth, Sam believes that there is such a thing as objective truth. Jordan tends to be more of a pragmatist. He tends to believe that truth is sort of what is useful to a certain extent. Um, and my, I grew with Sam, but I'm not sure how he gets to objective truth from a scientific materialist worldview. Why is their objective truth as opposed to what you think is what you think being evolutionarily beneficial. How do you get from that too? It's a universal principle that is objective Lee. True. It's, it's, it's a bit of a jump. Well it depends on what the concept is, right?

Speaker 1:          02:00:57       Like what are you talking about in terms of, I'm talking about, I'm talking about anything that Sam says is true. What makes it true as opposed to just evolutionarily beneficial for us to think. So meaning what evolution does is it creates a series of thoughts in our mind. Presumably if you're a materialist that are beneficial to your preservation and promulgation of the species, right? They're not active actually true. So if it's beneficial, this is the Sam's real explanation for the prevalence of religion. For example, he'll say religion is true, but evolutionary biology sort of drives people toward religions. So you can have group bonds that are beyond 150 people or whatever. So why doesn't that apply to math? Why is it the two and two? How do you know that too? And to actually equals four as opposed to it is evolutionary been evolutionarily beneficial for you to believe that two plus two equals four.

Speaker 1:          02:01:42       So Sam believes there is an objective truth somewhere out there. The two plus two equals four I don't know what evolution has to do with that sort of stuff. So what do you think is happening that he disagrees with? So I think that what is happening is that human beings were placed in an orderly universe through the processes of biology and have a unique capacity to understand that universe because we are made in the image of God. This is where I think that the religious viewpoint diversity is pretty strongly from from Sam's usually leave in evolution. Yes.

Speaker 2:          02:02:12       Believe that evolution was a process that was created by God to formulate human beings.

Speaker 1:          02:02:17       Yes. Interesting. Yeah. I mean that's, that's the nice thing about being religious. You can attribute most, most everything to God is fine. Well, here's the thing. It's not that implausible.

Speaker 2:          02:02:30       If there was some sort of a grand plan, there would be no regard for like all, but got to get a rush on this. Making the evolutionary being, you know, we're going to,

Speaker 1:          02:02:41       you know, but it was all salaried. The process. It's a fine tuning arguments about how implausible it would be for just Adam's roaming around the universe randomly to end with with human creation. You know, the, the alternative explanations seemed no, no more, no less implausible to me, like the multiple universes theory plausible, but we have no way to prove it because we can't get to those multiple universes. So how that testable or the or the now popular theory that we're living in an AI simulation, not sure how that's more testable than God. Not sure how it's more testable that aliens put us here. Like how has any of this test, why is that more testable or more plausible than the idea that there is a force behind that which we see that has mine. Well, let's, let's just break this down slowly.

Speaker 2:          02:03:29       There's obviously something that's happening. There's obviously something that went from the Big Bang to planet earth in 2019 with cellular communication and satellite dishes and obviously something happened, something pretty radical. Why is it happening? Is it happening because of random events that sort of coincide with biology and the technology and all these things come to fruition? To you and I standing across from each other talking on this podcast in front of millions of people

Speaker 1:          02:04:02       w or it

Speaker 2:          02:04:03       is this, is this just how things go is things compete, constantly try to get better and then in this gigantic ecosystem of all these things competing and trying to get better, one super successful organism us rises above and continues and continues and by far passes all these other creatures below it and moves

Speaker 1:          02:04:25       we in our estimation, I mean if you, if you really believe in evolution, you can't think we're done right? It's got to be moving towards some better product and it keeps going until it creates so [inaudible]. Sam is more religious than I am. I think that there's a plausible argument for atheism. I just don't think that there is a plausible argument for Sam's moral vision of atheism. Meaning that what, what, what Sam tends to do. Is it like for example, you and I have talked a lot on this particular podcast about the value of self betterment and making decisions and being responsible for those decisions. How does that work in an area where you don't have free? Well, so Sam actively says we do not have free. Well, yeah, that's a weird conversation. It is. It is a weird conversation and sort of a self defeating one.

Speaker 1:          02:05:06       Sam suggests when it comes to the scientific method that we are using science to find out truths about the universe and we're using reasons him. He's very big on reason. I also am big on reason, but I don't know how Sam is defining reason as opposed to just Aiden, evolutionarily beneficial firing of neurons, meaning that that's what we are at. We're balls Balsamiq wandering purposeless through the universe and then he'll talk about making our own meaning or seeking human human prosperity or a flourishing is the word he likes to use. These are all very active verbs, right? This is this, is it an active vision of man in the universe? Right, and I'm not sure how that flows from, we're a ball of meat that evolve from another ball of meat that evolve to wrench. Really, if you go back far enough from non balls of meat without any, without any free will, without any capacity to choose. I don't, I don't know how you build a civilization on that.

Speaker 2:          02:05:56       Well the two different conversations here. One is determination or determinism rather whether or not you have freewill or whether or not your life and your actions are being dictated by the past, by your biology, by your learned experiences, by external pressures. What is causing this very clear decision that you make? Is this freewill? Oh you decided I'm going to get my shit together or all the factors around you pushing you and funneling you into this, this direction that you, it's unavoidable to you. Right. And that you are not a product of freewill. You're just a product of a lot of different factors, right? Or is it both? Is it that you are the product of your environment and your life experiences end? You also have free will,

Speaker 1:          02:06:42       right, and I'm, I'm in the latter. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:06:44       I'm in the latter group I think as well. I think we also experienced great benefit from making positive choices and then experiencing like whenever you meet someone who's lost a lot of weight, one of the things they have is his fucking tremendous feeling of accomplishment. Yup. Yeah, I lost a hundred pounds. You're like, holy shit man, a hundred pounds. Right? Like they get this positive feedback from it. There's, there's real good and making good choices. And when people decide to get their shit together and make a good choice, there were awarded. The question is, are you doing that because of determinism or are you doing that because of freewill? Or are you doing that because of a combination of both of those things? And can you fuel that freewill purposely through like outwardly seeking things that are motivational or things that are educational, things that allow you to kind of roadmap the way you process reality, right? Which can be beneficial and can aid in you taking steps towards exercising your freewill. Right.

Speaker 1:          02:07:40       Well, this, and this is why I think that in the end it, right. But I think it's pretty fundamental question. And I think that that's why in the end I'm religious and I'm not sure why Sam isn't because he agrees with the same premises, right? He'll, he'll, he'll talk about self betterment and decisions that you can make, and then he'll write a full book about why free will doesn't exist. And I just don't understand how those two things can coexist.

Speaker 2:          02:08:03       Yes. It's a, well, I think it's a thought experiment, first of all, I think the whole determinism thing is a thought experiment because there's really no way to determine, right.

Speaker 1:          02:08:14       You have the argument though, for sure. Right? I mean, like there's just no way to, to act to otherwise. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:08:19       Um, but I, I guess I've absolutely act as if I have free will, right. And we all do. And I get angry at myself when I fucked things up. I don't say, well, it's just determined as a man. Right, right. No, that doesn't get you in the, and the button may be it's determinism that has put me in this position where I'm the kind of guy that gets upset if I fuck things up. Right. No, I don't know man. I don't know. But I don't know if you know either. That's my, my take on all these things when people get really rigid with their ideologies. Yeah. I'm like, okay, I want to hear it out. I want to hear the whole thing. You know, I want to hear it all. I'm not sure if you know, I think there's a, I think there's no, I think there's a lot that I don't know, but I think that there's more plausible and less plausible.

Speaker 2:          02:08:58       Yeah, I agree. Um, this is where I think people misunderstand you. You have your beliefs, but you're not a car that imposes them on people. And I think we need to be way more reasonable in terms of the way we address people's beliefs. And, uh, I've been guilty of this in the past. I'm sure many people, everyone else, everyone has. But I think it's a core component to a healthy community is to allow people to have their own beliefs and you know, who knows, man, maybe your beliefs on gay people will adjust and move over time as you get older and move into a gay neighborhood. And I don't know, it looks good. It's not, it's not about tolerance. Fire.

Speaker 1:          02:09:40       Yeah. I mean I don't, yeah, yeah. It's, it, it's, it's a difference between understanding people are as, as whole people and then saying that I don't like some of the things that they do and simply saying the making the assumption that because I don't like some of the things that you do. We can't be friends or I disapprove of you as an entire human being, which I think is not true. True.

Speaker 2:          02:09:58       It's a good belief system to have. If you're straight and then you go look, got it locked down. Don't need to worry about that. I got a prop. But if you were gay god down, there'll be a pain. Absolutely. I mean, it would be annoying if you just always wanted to bang dudes and everyone's saying no and you're like, no, no, no. Nobody said religions. Easy, man. What's the value in it though? If you're a, if you're a giant Homo, all right? And all you want to do is go to gay discos and party your ass off. That's what you enjoy. Some people like golf, okay. Some people, some people like parasailing. Some dudes just want to fucking get it on, man. Want to dress

Speaker 1:          02:10:34       up like the village people and go have a fucking party. That's why Santa Monica Blvd. Such a hotspot and they find each other. Do whatever you want to do. Honestly, do whatever you want to do. Men Don't do it. Ask me to think that, you know, don't ask me to like put my stamp of moral approval. I understand that. Do what you want to do. Like it's a free country. This, this should be a free country, not just, it is a free country. It should be a free country. It should not be my job to police your personal behavior. Right? Right. Like you as, I mean I have to approve it on a personal level, right? But I'm a jerk. If I want to impose my belief system on, on your personal behavior that affects no one else. I mean that's the definition of being an, and I'm a hypocrite if I continue to berate you about your,

Speaker 2:          02:11:14       your opinion on gay folks. What do I give a fuck what your opinion is correct. Because you are a reasonable person and you do, you're very polite and eve, you're in friends with Dave Ruben. So there you go. This guy has got to be something there. It's um, it's a strange thing though, this, uh, this need that people have for everyone to think the way they think and I understand the need to reinforce your own thoughts and, and, and, and argue them and try to figure out a way to debate that the other person's perspective is incorrect and your perspective is correct. I understand all these inclinations that people have, but uh, I, I think that they conflate that with bigotry. Right. You know, and I don't think, I don't think you're a bigot. I don't agree with you about gay folks, but that's one of the, the marijuana thing is just, I just don't think you have any experience

Speaker 1:          02:12:08       center. Right. And as far as the, as far as disagreeing, I think that we probably don't disagree on gay folks. I think we disagree on identity and gay activity and all the rest of it. I mean, as human beings, these are human beings that I know many gay people who I think are significantly better human beings than religious people.

Speaker 2:          02:12:27       Yeah, yeah. I'm glad you said that. Yeah, I think it did it in a way, I don't have a defined religion but in a way I have some pretty rigid ideas that I have in my head about behavior and ethics and morals and how you treat PB care about those are, those are like, they're pretty rigid. And I think one of the things that religion does is it allows you to have this sort of ethical framework sort of like, um, w what is it called? Scaffolding. Like when you're building it, like it allows you to develop a more disciplined life and it just shows you this is good and this is bad. And it's clear and there's this most, for the most part, it's good for the most part, these are, these are good patterns to follow. And I think that I've most certainly sort of adopted my own somewhere along the way.

Speaker 1:          02:13:26       I think we all do. Yeah. I mean, honestly a value system effectively is usually a form of religion. Right? So when you're saying

Speaker 3:          02:13:32       that Sam has religious, he's a religious ACA atheists, you're not, yeah. You're not being inaccurate. There's a lot of folks do that. We do develop these sort of principles that we follow. We're not just free willy nilly just doing whatever we want all day long. No one does that.

Speaker 1:          02:13:48       And the reason I say it is sort of facetiously, but I think that we all make fundamental assumptions about the nature of human life. And we have to recognize that those are assumptions. You can't, it's, it's not reason all the way down. Yeah. That because that tends to actually become even more inflexible than it's, I'm the only reasonable person in the room. My reasons are the only ones that matter. And so it's my reasons all the way down, the acknowledge that we're all making some assumptions and then we can discuss whether those assumptions are worthwhile or not.

Speaker 3:          02:14:11       Yeah. The thing that when it comes with religion in defining whether or not other people's behaviors sinful, but where it doesn't involve you, that's where a lot of folks start thinking that maybe these ideas are bigoted. Right. But it does involve me,

Speaker 1:          02:14:26       meaning that the diamond, well, I'm, I'm enjoying every sin that I say is a sin is a sin that enjoins me. It's just that I may not have a desire for that particular sin

Speaker 3:          02:14:35       in meaning I'm not, I'm not holding people to a different standard than I hold myself, nor am I saying that I never sin. Right. But you know that you have different biological desires and they do. You can kind of acknowledge that. All right. Of course, that's true. Yeah, of course. That's true. By the same token, I assume that a gay guy doesn't have the desire to set up a thousand women, which most straight guys do. Yeah. Why do you think if, if God has a plan, why do you think you would create gay people? I mean, I think that God creates, first of all, I don't think that I'm in a position to evaluate God's plan. I wish I work. But if you like gods, if I, if I had to guess, God creates people with all sorts of different challenges and those challenges span the spectrum.

Speaker 3:          02:15:13       I mean, I, I'm not, so God sneaks it up on you. Hey Man, I know this is gonna be fucked up, but you're going to just like, Dude's like forget about women. You're gonna like dudes. I am not. I want you to ignore that one of my old book. I don't know why God gives people drives. I don't know. I got it gives kids cancer. I don't know a lot of things about God. Wish I did. It would make my life a lot easier. So you think that that is a challenge akin to any other challenge that a human being might face in this life? That the challenge have been a lot harder. Yeah, but a lot more difficult and a lot more straining and lot. Yeah, of course. You think there's value in following that challenge and not acting on gay urges. I think the, I think there can be, and you're having sex with a woman, plug your nose, go through and make a face cause you discussed or did you create it?

Speaker 3:          02:15:56       Did you create a baby out of that? Did that bit, is that baby like a part of your life now that does it that is deep and meaningful. Mm. Maybe. What about there are a lot of in and pass it. There are a lot of gay guys having kids. What about people saying living their truth? I'm living in my truth. Ben Shapiro. Well, I mean as a general rule, living my truth as a bunch of crap. Like there's, there's living your opinion, which is fine, like live your opinion and how you want. Again, that gets back to do what you want. As long as it's not bothering me. Living my truth is a different thing. That's one of them. Social media creations like living my truth. That's just bullshit. I'm sorry. [inaudible] my truth is bullshit. It's, there's no such thing. Your truth. There's that truth and then there is your opinion and we do have to, for purposes of conversation, at the very least, it's deeply irritating when people say living my truth, because then it's like, I disagree with you, and then they're like, well, you're, you're disavowing music.

Speaker 3:          02:16:40       Human being. No, I just disagree. Like you can be you, you can do what you want. Like you do whatever, man. Calm, calm. Yeah. Like I'm I, how did I become the most loosey Goosey Libertarian, lean back guy in the world, in the society. How is this possible? The most uptight person I know. How is this a thing? Well, you know as well as I do that the further you go left you, you, you, you reached the same sort of zealotry that you do when you go all the way rice. Correct. You, you meet these crazy people that are just completely connected to their idea of being correct and they take the most rigid stance on all these issues on the left side or on the right side. And it's so goddamn common. It's human behavior. It's also incredibly boring. I mean, there's just nothing to discuss with with, yeah, I agree.

Speaker 3:          02:17:29       And that's one of the reasons why it's so disgusting when people miss labeled people like, so it was an article that connected me with Richard Spencer. Like what? And the fuck. Like that is such a disingenuous thing to do and they know what they're doing. They're the trying to get me to react to it and talk about it and we'll get more. It's put, it's horse shit like anybody. But if you are locked into that far left ideology, as far left as you can go, and it's one of the problems with ideologies that have these extremists is that you believe in a percentage of the things these people say, but then they go way too far with it. But you're connected with them. You're connected with them because you're a part of that. Even though you don't have a similar notion. Steven pinker got brow beaten over suggesting that failure to ask questions and give plausible answers gives, excuse me, credence to the alt right that that if you do a essay, he did a whole speech where he said, listen, there are lots of conversations about Iq and race and they all right loves these conversations because then they then they suggest wrongly the black people are inherently unfit and white people are more fit and all of that kind of stuff and he says there are great ways to explain how much of Iq is is cultural, how much can be changed, how much has genetic, how much that actually matters in terms of real life outcomes.

Speaker 3:          02:18:50       We can do all those things, but when you say don't ask the question, stop asking the question, then you make people Google. And the only thing that they will Google and find our answers that are given by people who are actually outright, and he got ripped as outright for this argument, was don't allow people to push into outright answers by failing to give them proper responses or by throwing them out the window. And then people are like, well, you're all right now because you're saying that, that people should be able to ask questions like, it's almost like, it's just like, it's the exact same version as people in the religious community where it's like, you know, I used to go to Sunday school and then I asked him any questions and they kicked me out. Right? That's, that's not how religion is supposed to work. That's not how, that's not how reason it's supposed to work, not how any of this is supposed

Speaker 2:          02:19:28       to work. Right. And there's also, when you're investigating any thing, any measurable thing, w when you find a number, whatever it is, like these people, like a Asian folks are better at mathematics. UH, European folks are better at this and like what is, what's the reason for that? Like what, what's, let's find out, is it cultural, is it biologicals? It's something can we learn about how human beings evolved and adapted? Why are Nigerian so smart? Like there's so many Nigerians that come to this country. They thrive, they thrive in business. They're extremely motivated. They're extremely disciplined. It's like, it's like almost like Korean folks. Why do Koreans like, why are they so hardworking? Why are they strived? And obviously these are big generalizations, but what is it about Italians? What, what, what makes them wear gold chains and loved mafia movies? Like what is it?

Speaker 2:          02:20:18       Those are my people. We go with the what the fuck? Why are they all talk like that? Like what is that? What causes any sort of ethnic group to turn out the way they turned out? What and why are so many European Jews Nobel Prize winners? What the fuck is going on over there and also like what is the impact of the measurable on how we live our lives? Like Shit, how much should this stuff matter? Is this, is this a result of discrimination or is this a result of something else? Is it true that when you group any group of people together, racially or non racially, there will be disparities between those two groups of people. This is just true statistically like, but not asking those questions and then saying, shut down the questions. What that actually does is it leads people to only get the answers to the questions from the people who don't know what they're talking about in many cases and who are giving convenient, easy, and self laddering answers about the nature of, of themselves.

Speaker 2:          02:21:04       The fear is it being used by racist to reinforce their position? Right, but what you find out is that those agents are a superior race, right? They'll, they'll do and they'll do that anyway. One of the, one of the funniest things about white supremacists is they're so fucking stupid. I mean, pardon the language. Like the, the white supremacists are invariably not the Nobel prize winners. It's, it's, hey, go to a white supremacist compound. You're not looking at a bunch of people who are carrying cancer. These people piss me off and it, and this is an now and I'll say, oh, that won't matter to medial label me outright tomorrow. Cause that's what I, this goes well, the disingenuous media that's being less and less taken seriously taking less than less seriously. It seems to me that that trend, which is a common trend that's existed for the last few years of these click baity bullshit articles and mislabeling people, it's going to go away because your, your, your perspective is not going to be appreciated.

Speaker 2:          02:21:54       It's not going to be respected if you, if you're obviously making disingenuous statements like that. And I think, um, we're in this weird position where it's very difficult to find real journalism and real objective takes on things that aren't flavored by their ideology. And everybody's trying to shape everybody and they feel like it's their obligation. They feel there's many people that write things that feel like it's their obligation to change your perspective on a national subjects and things that are important to us that not their obligation to just report what's going on, but also their obligation to flavor things in a way that will make one side look favorable to the other.

Speaker 3:          02:22:30       Yeah. Well, I'm, I'm very much in favor of journalists revealing their biases. I think that the, the greatest line media is that objective journalism is a thing. So I'm conservative. You don't go to my site, you'll get a conservative spend on the news. That's the way it's going to work. Right? And guess what? CNN is liberal and they're going to give you the liberal spin on the news. And that's just the way this is going to work to do. See the video, when the Mueller report came out and they look, look, somebody got killed. Oh my God. It was crazy. Shit. Kennedy got shot. Yeah. Exit. Yeah. Should you be happy if you guys believed in Mueller, everybody was like, Mueller is the fucking man. He's going to go get Trump. This guy, he's methodical. He's precise, people getting booted out and everything. Votive candles with his face on them that they could like bird. They were pumped. Yeah. And then he came out and it was like, well no collusion or it was like, well I guess that now it's a cover up. It's like, wait, what? Wait a minute. Yeah, maybe. Maybe. Maybe the narrative has it, maybe the narrative has, has, has trumped the actual job you were supposed to do guys?

Speaker 2:          02:23:21       Well, it's just so many people were so convinced and there were so many people that were making statements that in retrospect are probably

Speaker 3:          02:23:31       like you could probably, I mean, I don't want to say I'm not a litigious person, but if I was a guy like Donald Trump, oh man. Yeah. There's so many people to sue. It was, it was amazing. I mean I remember I was on Bill Maher's show and we were supposed to talk about free speech stuff in like five minutes before and he's like, let's talk about Russia, his producer, Kevin, let's talk about Russia. And I was like, okay, fine. So we get on to producers so that, yeah, this is like right before they switched the topic for your TV shows where they just tell you what you have to talk. The guy comes in with a clipboard. Yeah, it was, it was a little bit, it was a little bit strange. And we got on stage and we, he's talking about Trump, Russia collusion, and I said what I've always said, which is I'll wait for the evidence to come out and then I will make a decision as to whether Trump, Russia collusion was a thing and Bill Maher's Datical.

Speaker 3:          02:24:15       I know. And Bill Margot's you don't, you don't believe it was a thing. And I was like, well I don't see any evidence yet that it was a thing. Like I see some evidence of attempts to collude like John Jr I see some attempts of people trying to get information, but I don't see evidence of like actual legal collusion. And why don't we just wait like you guys keep wanting Muller to gives her like let's just wait on it. And Mark could not believe that this was my perspective. Right. It was like, it was like shocking to him. Why should, why should the perspective, I'm waiting for more evidence be shocking to anyone when it is obvious the evidence is not out. Like why? Why is that in any way controversial? It's, it's bewildering to me

Speaker 2:          02:24:50       because people have this need to let everyone know that they're on the right side and they want you to know that they do believe in the collusion. If you disagree with that for whatever reason, you must either be a right wing person, a Trump supporter or someone who's in denial, someone who doesn't look at the evidence and you're a part of the problem. Yup. But the, the real problem was jumping to conclusions. There obviously seem to be some attempts. There's, there's obviously some fuckery with that IRA company that the, the Internet research agency that is responsible for

Speaker 3:          02:25:24       millions of interactions with people online where they pretended to be different supporters. Yes. They, they caused conflict, like constant conflict in regards to political opinion and that's all real. That was coordinated effort to try to change people's opinions, but how much that had to do with Donald Trump. How much did they ask for? First of all, you've got no evidence. Also, I was always bewildered by this theory, like did you watch that campaign? Um, that was not the most well coordinate campaign and it was chaos. It was chaos. I mean, I knew everybody who was in the campaign, like it was a, it was a shit show and the idea that they're sitting there but there, but when the mass comes off at night, they call it Vladimir Putin and they put together a point by point plan on how they're going to swing this particular precinct in rural, in rural Michigan.

Speaker 3:          02:26:07       It's like, what? What are you, are you guys hi? Like what are you talking about? Like, like it, if you could attribute this to anything here, here's a good rule of thumb for politics. Attribute everything to stupidity. Unless you can prove malice. The real problem, and this is something that is very similar in what we were talking about earlier. When you say something and you say it over and over and over again, and you say it with such conviction and it becomes a giant part of your news narrative and then that's something turns out to be horseshit. Yup. You just massively empowered Trump. That's it. That's exactly right. And a massive land for a long time that you know, I'm not a big fan of Trump's fake news shtick because I think he applies it to broadly. I think that whenever there's a bad piece of news, he's like fake news and it's like, well sometimes yes and sometimes no by now that you just blew a two year narrative where he was clearly in Putin's pocket, how many people were you thinking to listen to the nuanced view of fake news now and how many people do you think are going to actually believe Trump when he says that a bad piece of news is legitimately a fake piece of news.

Speaker 3:          02:27:07       Yeah. And empowers him in a, in a, in a spectacular manner. They made a giant mistake. Oh yeah. And they blew, they blew this one in spectacular fashion. People are still hanging in there with all they had to do. This is true for so many people right now. All you have to do is not be crazy. Just stop it. It's all you have to do. It was talking about the possibility that Trump has been a Russian assets and it's like 1987 or some shit, so it was a, I mean Andrew Mccabe, the former FBI director was asked whether Trump was legitimately a Russian asset and he's like, I don't know. It's like you're using the power of the institution. He used to run to spread this nonsense and he got that from John Brennan. He got it from James Clapper and these are all former heads of the intelligence agencies.

Speaker 3:          02:27:46       Just makes me think the intelligence agencies need to be wildly her back. If these were the heads of them. I mean if like the heads of the intelligence agencies are using their platform to proclaim that they have inside information about Trump, that turns out to be utter nonsense. I'm not sure these people should have that much power to like, Geez, is that what he's saying or is he saying he doesn't know? He didn't say, I dunno. He was saying like I have basically I expect that Mueller's going to indict as a former intelligence professional. I expect it. Yeah. There's a lot of that. It was ugly. Adam Schiff on the, on the Intel Committee doing the same thing. It's crazy now because like what do they do now? Like how do they rebound from this? If this is that you didn't let just say once. This is something you said for two years you've seen the compilation videos, they've done them to rap music and so they're like, they put a beat behind it and have you seen it?

Speaker 3:          02:28:33       No. There's some great ones, some great comp. There's compilations of people saying possible collusion, possible collusion, possible in this music that goes with it and they just cut to possible collusion with the Russians. Possible Russian collusion. Possible Russian collusion. It's, yeah. They blew it in a major way. Yeah. I mean there's plenty of shit to complain about. You didn't have to go with that. Like the idea was that he was a train at target rich environment when you decided to go to, he's a Russian trader. It's no way out or something. And he was Kevin Costner as a last thing. Like what? He could have ever beaten Hillary. Sorry. I'm going to check my watch to get out of here man. I do a little bit when you have to leave right now. I wanted to ask you one more question. One more question. What did you think about this?

Speaker 3:          02:29:14       Um, Chelsea manning situation? Cause I, I don't know exactly what happened other than she's in contempt of court and so they've got her in solitary confinement. Now w this is about testifying against speaking. I'll be honest, I haven't been following it that closely. I mean, my understanding is that Chelsea Manning, who, okay, say, here's where we get color. Bradley. No, he changed the name. He changed his name to Chelsea. He has a biological male can leave your eyes. Gendering are you dead naming as well? Don't know. No I don't. But unless we are talking about when he committed his crime, do you explain he was actually Bradley as opposed to Chelsea. Right. So if we're talking about, so he presented those convicted that was a male named Bradley Manning. Did you say they, you're talking about the formerly known as Bradley. And if we're talking about the human being who is currently in jail, that is a male who is currently known as Chelsea.

Speaker 3:          02:30:01       So, okay. So my understanding is that Bradley is that Chelsea manning is a refused to hand over information that he was legally bound to handover about wikileaks. And now there were complaints that he's being held in solitary, but that's not true apparently. Uh, and that he's being mistreated. I do find it weird that the same people who are complaining about Donald Trump coordinating with wiki leaks are very upset about Chelsea manning going to jail for coordinating with wikileaks. You're gonna need to pick one or the other is wikileaks batteries. Wiki leaks. Not Bad. What is wikileaks? It's only dependent upon whether or not they're supporting the narrative that you want. That's exactly right. And lackey leaks was very good. Right, right, right. Exactly. It was right and left by the way, like there are people on the right where it's like Julian Julian Sanchez, the worst and then 2016 happened like Julian Assange.

Speaker 3:          02:30:48       Now there's a person I can really talk to. It's like, well, no, I'm pretty sure Julian Assange is a wiki leaks. Good information. Suggest they are Russian front group and take make up that what you will end of story. Do you think that they became a Russian front group to try to stay operative and stay safe because they were obviously being attacked by the United States government and endanger being shut down and then they've kept, I mean, he's been in the US. I really don't know enough about wikileaks to to to really get into it. I don't want to see the historical, but I know that he's been trapped in that embassy for

Speaker 2:          02:31:20       since 2012 yeah. I mean I hope that he's got some video games or something in there. Fuck man. He's been in there for like seven years now. Right. That's a long time to be in an end, but it's a long time. It can't go outside. No sunlight. Pamela Anderson visits every now and then. He's fucked, man. I mean it's, it's a terrible place to be. And I don't know if it's better than prison because it's like the stress of him never knowing when they're going to come knock down the door and pull him out of there. I was like, how, how wild is that guys sleep? Yeah. Seven years in that embassy. It can be great. It can be great. It's gotta be awful. They took his internet in a way, right?

Speaker 1:          02:31:52       Uh, I think they did. That's fucked. Although to be fair, Wiki leaks was releasing information on specific American soldiers in lines of, of combat. So yes, they didn't redact any of the names. That was the problem. That's why people were pissed. Really? Yes. Because the original dump from Chelsea manning was that he dumped all the information to wikileaks, including the stuff that was unredacted and Ricky leaks just released it. They did. That was, that was the plane. That was the claim. Anyway.

Speaker 2:          02:32:14       Um, I don't know if that's accurate because if he, if he vine differently than let me know cause I'll, I'll be happy to correct all these. Yeah. You know, I'm sure you would. I just don't know if it that is, I don't know. I don't have the information in front of me. Do you want to check? No, they'll take too much time. That'll do. Folks, you're going to have to Google this one. Um, but so when, one of the things that I was thinking when Trump got into office while this drain, that swamp shit, I was like, well wonder if Trump would be a wiki leaks supporter. I wonder if Trump would be happy. It depends what if it helped him. Yeah, sure. Right, right. Or even and snowed in as well. I was wondering about that. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:32:50       It's same sort of thing. I mean, unfortunately politics very often has little to do with principal and everything to do with convenience. Yeah. So if it's helpful, sure. If not

Speaker 2:          02:32:58       like him who's always anti deep state and talking about the, the, these, I mean, I do have extremely critical,

Speaker 1:          02:33:05       yes. But I'll do, I have a feeling that once you actually sit in the big seat, I think that tends to change. Remember Obama was too. Yeah. And then five minutes later he was drawn in people.

Speaker 2:          02:33:16       Well listen, um, I know you've got to get out of here, so let's just wrap this up. Tell people about your book.

Speaker 1:          02:33:20       Yeah. So you can check out my book. The right side of history talks about a lot of the sort of deeper issues we were talking about Judeo Christian values and reason and sort of the, it's, it's a kind of short form philosophical history of the West from Sinai through Greece and talking about all the major enlightenment philosophers, some of the things we talked about on the show or in the book. It's number one bestseller on the New York Times nonfiction list, at least at the moment. Congratulations man. That's awesome. I appreciate it. It's really pretty spectacular to exciting. Exactly.

Speaker 2:          02:33:44       Um, your show also Ben Shapiro show, you can get the Ben Shapiro show on iTunes. You can get it on Youtube, your Sunday review, which I did once. Yeah. Sunday special. It's special enough to have you on again. I would love to. Thank you. Thanks for being here, and your book's available on Amazon everywhere. Okay. Bench Shapiro, Ladies and gentlemen,

Speaker 4:          02:34:03       that was great.
