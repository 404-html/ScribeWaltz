Speaker 1:          00:00          The general good experience, so I went, I went to like a day of media training and it was a. I did, I did and it was the worst part was I've done interviews and I've been fine before, but I got this guy sitting across from me who's, who's interviewing me doing this mock interview and then I've got the publicist and my writing partner and they're just staring at me and that will listen. I can't do it. Right. All the pressures there. Who's teaching you? Who's teaching this training? Here's where they right away. Like, you kind of suck at. This. Absolutely works. I mean, they were really nice about it. They were like, okay, well there's some, there's some room for improvement. Oh my God. Really? Oh yeah. No, it was the worst. It will seem like a natural. I mean there's what is there to teach you? Well what? Well this, this is the thing that I'm really comfortable with this, with, with, with us just hanging out here talking. Sure. But this is what I do is I yammer when I'm nervous talker. So you asked me a question if I'm nervous. I just kind of go and go and go and people are like, Geez man, that guy talk man.

Speaker 1:          01:09          So the thing is I got this guy sitting across me, really nice guy and he's The guy who's coaching me, but I know I'm going to give you like fake interviews. Well he probably quote you first. He gave me. He gave me a lot of really good insights and the funny thing is every rule that he's saying as he's saying it, I'm going, Oh yeah, I do that. Oh yeah, like everything he's saying that I shouldn't be doing. I'm like, oh yeah, that's. I always do. What is he saying you shouldn't be doing? I mean that the main thing, it's Kinda like what we were getting at before that when somebody setting a trap for you, because so much of right now media training is just about don't go out and get yourself into trouble by going in and just talking about some ridiculous area that.

Speaker 1:          01:48          Because that's what people. That's what everybody's trying to do now. Like just as a. for example, I did a Time magazine interview about adoption about a year before we even made the movie. Really? Yeah. And it was just because I was in the process of working on the movie and anyway, so the whole thing was just about adoption and my family and whatever. And it was right when the Harvey Weinstein stuff was blowing up. So ladies, really nice interview. And then at the end she says, uh, hey, you know, since I'm talking to a Hollywood director, I'd be remiss if I didn't ask did you know about that Harvey Weinstein stuff? And I was like, Nah, I didn't even think about my answer because I don't know. I didn't know the guy was never around any of it. That's sort of like more like fancy movies. And I was like, yeah, I know I don't. I don't know. I never met the guy, whatever. I didn't think anything of it. I got off the phone and then I thought, oh, she didn't say, what do you think about this stuff? She said, did you know about that stuff? And it was like. And I knew, but I kept it a secret for those people and I just thought right away,

Speaker 2:          02:48          you know, the limiting factor was just like I was just getting bored. I wasn't actually breathing when we're thinking of this is the thing. I mean, you had to, at any given time, any time you had to think of something that was going to be more powerful than the thought of stopping or fatigue or clc get deeper into your skin. And so sometimes it was really easy because you were swimming with dolphins, minky whales as one with the basking shark. Did they come over to you going, what the fuck is this dude? Yeah, there was, yeah, there's a, there was a video of that ages ago with the, uh, the minky well, and the, I was filming 12 hours cross the Bristol channel, so that's kind of England to Wales. And uh, this was, this was without doubt for all the hardship that I've spoke about.

Speaker 2:          03:29          I just want to say there were some amazing moments. This one particular moment swimming across the, uh, the Bristol Channel and all of a sudden minky, well, kind of about big as this table breaches right next to me. And I was like, whoa, because I tend to map the captain. I was like, man, am I safe? Like, what's going on? Should I get out the door? And he said, no, no, no, no, you're absolutely fine. And I was like, okay, because he's a monkey wildlife that the find the friendly. I was like, okay, fair enough. So I keep swimming and then for the next five miles, the minky whales circling me, it was breaching over the top. It was coming under me and swimming like that. I tend to mine. I said like, now what's going on? And he said, I've never seen this. He's been sailing like 40 years. He says, I've never seen this. He said, but what I think is happening is I think it's a female and I try to fuck you. Well, I said, it's not mating season. He was like, no, no, no, no, it's fine. It's fine. He goes, what are these for later? Have it here. I mean, I've seen him for four months in the water. I'm going to fuck mating seasons probably right around the corner. She was like, if he sticks around to move on.

Speaker 2:          04:33          So that was a concern of mine. That was a good one. Yeah. And it was. No. Matt said, no, no, no. I think it's a few more. I think that she thinks that you're an injured seal and so for the next five miles she basically guided me all the way to the shallower water and as I got there, it was literally the debt for the water. Matt said, Yep, Yep. Much shallower water. And we turned whale breached one more time and then. And then swam off as if to say, you know, you're safe now.

Speaker 3:          05:02          Well why is there so much pushback against this thing? Is that I think what's going on as a people worry that it doesn't look like a problem to be solved anymore. So when you. When our kids, we both have lots of gay friends, but we didn't know it because they're not telling anybody because someone's going to kick their ass if they knew that they were gay. Gay people are still discriminated against, but it's so much better than it was. Then. What you don't want to. What I think people are advocates don't want to say is, well, there's no problem anymore because then you can allow them to still run into troubles in various circumstances. Even though the trouble they run into today is a thousand times less than the trouble they ran two and little same thing holds for racism. Same thing holds for sexism. They've all gotten so much better, but and sexual violence is a perfect example.

Speaker 3:          05:43          If you look at, if you set, this isn't pinker's book, if you set rape and homicide to you call it both of them, whatever level they are in 1970 to 100 and then you track them through to the early two thousands. Homicide is in the U. S homicides dropped to like 50 raves dropped down to like 25, but if you listen to women's advocacy groups about campus sexual assault and stuff, you'd never know that and the reason you wouldn't know it is because they. People worry. Well, if you think the problem's getting better on sound, then you will keep doing anything to help fix it. And that's a really unfortunate part of our psychology because it makes people feel like there's been no progress and when you feel like there's no progress, then you think, well maybe we need to completely overturn the whole system and try something new.

Speaker 3:          06:23          And that's of course the point of pinker's newest book, enlightened men now. No things are going freaking great. Turn it anarchy and all those things are really bad ideas. Voting for somebody like trump's a really bad idea because things are actually running along really nicely. It's just that we tend to forget it because every advocacy group who's all worried about whatever their particular issue is, doesn't want the word to get out that things are a lot better than they used to be because I think at some fundamental level they think, well, 25 reps here isn't bad enough. We better say that there's 100 or you know, I'm not saying they do this consciously, but of course 25 reps here, whatever the number is, is bad enough. Right. It doesn't. It doesn't have to be the numbers that it used to be when I was a child to be a problem at all. It has to be as a number above zero

Speaker 4:          07:02          for my whole apprenticeship. Alcohol was a reward. You know, you did a good job tonight. Drink, you know. Then it went from a reward. Do. Oh Shit. There was like a blood bath in the restaurant. You know, we had to pick up this guy at the hospital. Okay. It's not every word. Let's forget about it. Let's drink, you know. And it was, it was always there. You know, it's great service. Let's have a drink in the food industry, but you're also in the wine industry because 50 percent of what you're doing is selling food to people and the other 50 percent of what you're doing is selling alcohol at the people, so by default you're part of the people that sell a liquid drug dealer in that you're in that world every day and you go to wine tastings. You'd talk with peoples that sell the alcohol, alcoholic bartenders.

Speaker 4:          07:50          You talked to people that sell wine, you or partake in eating and other your colleagues, restaurants and drinking wine. Next thing you know, you have a little bit of celebrity. You've been open for 15 years and you look back and you go to seven days in a week or seven days in a week and I drank six of them. I'll feel good on Sunday. I'm just kind of recovering. And then what? What happens is one week turns into two to four and then you kind of look back and you realize in 2017 that you may have drank 48 weeks out of 52, you know, and then it goes quick. Then it's 10 years and your tenure restaurant and you've been drinking five days out of the week for 10 years and then all of a sudden you kind of have a problem. You realize that like my day to day is based on food and wine. Right now. I don't want my, it's not making me happy. I've had all the wines have had all the foods. My, am I better for it? Not really. What am I better for? Restriction eating less. Eating clean. Uh, drinking only on very special occasions. Do you still drink on special? I don't want. I'm completely sober. No,

Speaker 5:          09:07          you see them and I've even seen them switched teams and you see them switch teams and I don't buy the rationalizations when it comes to ideology, but I think is what they're doing is they're switching teams because they realize there's an end on this team and they could just say this is the problem with the team. I used to be on those fucking losers and they're, they're really benedict arnold. Right? Like like they probably have as much of an affinity to the ideas of one side is a do the other side. They just go all in on one side to get acceptance from the group. You just no way. People change their opinion that much over two years or something like that. Or you know, it's like they just decide this group makes more sense now and I've been attacked by people on the left so I'm going to go to the right or vice verse.

Speaker 5:          09:47          And usually what it is, is even when they say they've been attacked, like, oh you fucking baby, there's 300 million people just in this country alone. If you put something out there publicly and a thousand people attack, you don't act like you're being persecuted. Okay. You have an idea. You've, you've, you've launched that idea out into the Zeit geist and people took a big shit on it. You know, whether it's people on the right are people on the left. You've got to be able to argue your point one way or the other and not just immediately jumped ship when someone who shares ideas with you decides that your idea sucks and maybe they're wrong and maybe you're right, but you've got to argue that through, but this idea of these partisan patterns that people just seem to automatically fall into. There's so detrimental to dialogue there, so detrimental to us and really understanding each other and really having some sort of a sense of community.

Speaker 5:          10:39          Right? This is a giant community of 300 million people. That's what it's supposed to be and this idea that it's this group is trying to fuck it up and they're trying to turn us all Muslims and this one wants everybody to be gay and this one wants everybody to have free food and this and this. This is nonsense. This is nonsense. We need better understanding and, and you know the word better. Education gets tossed around a lot, but it also means better social understanding, better social education, like got an appreciation of who we are and why we think the way we think and calling out weasels on both sides of the pattern, like calling out weasels on the right that are pandering, that are just trying to like get the repeating a lot of these like accepted beliefs because they know that they can hit this frequency and a lot of people sing along or the same thing that other people are doing on the left. They're doing it on both sides. I think most reasonable people have a collection of ideas that they share from both the right and the left and most reasonable people are reasonably compassionate and I think that's one of the things that we're missing.

Speaker 4:          11:42          But uh, yeah, most places they have them and they're managed and you go out and buy the small game license for 12 bucks or whatever. Get your hunter safety, get yourself a 22 or a shotgun and you can become a squirrel man or a squirrel lady like your Buddy Kevin Murphy list. One of my favorite guys on your podcast. He's a squirrel man. This guy blows a horn in the woods before every hunt to alert the animals that he's coming. Yeah. You blow up? Yeah. He carries a cow horn around. I think the, I think, um, it's in, uh, a show far. Right. Is that right for you when you blow the Shofar and like a Jewish synagogue? Is that what it is? I think it's called a show far like you've blown the rams. They blow a Ram's horn. It's not, it's not a cow. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          12:30          It's not a cow harm. It's ran her near the end of, um, you know, in the end have no country for old men. Yeah. Have we talked about this before? He talks about his father riding out ahead of him with a Horn of fire. In the end when you get, he relates the dream. It's in the book and it's in the movie for the Tommy Lee Jones characters describing a dream in which they're riding through a snowstorm and his father rides ahead with a Horn of fire. And I was wondering how many people heard that and had no idea what he was talking about, but what a common practice used to be as you take a horn buffalo horn, cow horn, and it's hollow because, um, it grows off of protrusion of the skull, called the horn core. Then you pop the horn off and it's hollow. And what people will do is when you left your campfire in the morning, you would fill that horn with embers and cap it, but there'd be a little pinhole in it just to let a little bit of air and air so could continue to smolder. And you carry that Horn all day full of embers. And at night to start a new fire, you would dump the horn out and rekindle your fire. So when he talks about his father riding out ahead of them with a Horn of fire, what that's meant to say is that he knew his father will be waiting out ahead of him with a fire burning. Oh yeah. But Kevin Murphy just blows it. Let squirrels noise coming.
