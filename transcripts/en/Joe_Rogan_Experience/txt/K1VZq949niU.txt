Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Gentlemen, very sorry for the late start here, but uh, unfortunately I'm the only one that's here. Uh, Brian and Eddie and Ari have not shown up yet. Brian's not showing up because he, uh, he was eating some yogurt and he bit down on his spoon and broke his fucking, which is, uh, one of the dumbest things I've ever heard in my life. So he's not going to be here and I'm not stuck in traffic because it's raining in La and when it rains in la, everybody freaks out and are stuck in traffic as well. So that's the story. Let me shut this off. I've got this. The Guru from gang starr died yesterday. Very, very sad. One of my favorite rap bands ever. Um, and tutors, only 43 years old. It makes you stay. That's only a year older than me. That's crazy. Shit. You know, dying of cancer and shit used to be healthy.

Speaker 1:          00:01:04       Now he's dead and that's life unfortunately. But the good thing is we still got this music life carries on and uh, maybe, maybe somewhere cooler right now, right? Who the fuck knows, right ladies. Gentlemen? So, uh, since I'm starting Solo, let's get started with a bunch of shit that's going on. First of all, this fucking strikeforce thing. You know, one of the reasons why the strikeforce thing is so fucked up is because they haven't really done it that many times. They haven't done these big CBS shows that many times and they made a bunch of big mistakes and the big brawl that happened afterwards. I mean, first of all, everyone was criticizing mayhem and everyone was saying that may have fucked up and made him like cost CBS. They're deal. Alright first of all may have, shouldn't have even been allowed to get into that octagon if that was the UFC.

Speaker 1:          00:01:58       They have security at the stairs. They have security at the top. There's, you can't just walk into the octagon. Well the fights are going on. It's literally not possible. You can't have that many teammates in the, in the octagon as well when, you know, when Jake shields, after his fight, he had like seven, six or seven of his buddies in the cage. Trainers, everybody. You can't have that many people. The UFC does not allow the UFC, I believe you're allowed to have three and they regulate it all and that's what you supposed to do as far as mayhem doing something that was inappropriate. Well, he definitely did something disrespectful. You know, Jake shields is in the middle of the biggest victory of his life. Just beads. Damn fucking Henderson and dominates them for four rounds after we got fucked up for the first round. So you know, it's a huge emotional victory for him and for his teammates.

Speaker 1:          00:02:46       His teammates rather, you know, this is a gigantic fight and he pulled it off. So, you know, emotions were running very high and mayhem stepped in and, and Bogart at the attention. And that's not. But it was a mistake, you know, he went in there to try to hype up the fight the same way they would do in the UFC the same way. You know, the famous George St Pierre. I'm not impressed with your performance. You know, when he went in there when Matt Hughes had just one, you know, that kind of shit happens to build up fights. That's what it's for. But this wasn't planned, you know, strikeforce didn't know what was going to happen, may have thought about it last minute. He just wanted a, you know, who was hyped up because he had one earlier than [inaudible] 91 or to rematch with jake shields. So he runs into the octagon and uh, you know, they start pushing them out of the way and then chaos erupts.

Speaker 1:          00:03:35       He should've never been allowed to get into the octagon. And if he was allowed to get into the cage, they should have had it regulated. It should have been a situation where when, you know, they would let jake shields speak. They ask them all the questions are gonna. Ask him totally respectfully. He gets his chance. He gets his moment to say what he has to say, thank his teammates. Then after all that's done, then mayhem comes in. If that's what they want. If that's a fight, they're hyping up next. Who the fuck knows what their plans were? They, their, their plans might not be a mayhem fight next. So it should have been up to them a, they should have, they should have regulated the cage. They should have made sure he didn't get in there as far as like what the Diaz brothers did and you know, and Gilbert Melendez, those guys have backing up there buddy.

Speaker 1:          00:04:21       All right. Those guys are like brothers. You know those guys. They're all a bunch of fucking psychos and savages. They're their buddy just wins the strikeforce middleweight title. Some pushing goes on there down to get in there. That's just the way they are, you know. I mean the Diaz brothers, you know, people always criticize them, but I think first of all I've been getting they shit way more interesting when you've got someone like nate and Nick Diaz that they don't give a fuck. Like they really don't give a fuck. Like they're not just pretending to not give a fuck. They'll do really don't give a fuck. They will fight in a brawl on CBS on prime time. They don't give a fuck. They really knew what was going on and they still stepped in there. Did that. You can't just have them all together like that and let anybody in that you want.

Speaker 1:          00:05:09       It's like I used to have pit bulls and when you get a bunch of pit bulls in the room, you can't get mad at the pit bulls if they fight each other. That's just what they do and these kinds of professional mixed martial arts fighters and in mixed martial arts, definitely there's a psychological aspect to it that's a huge component of of fighting and whether or not you win or lose and these guys have this psychological edge over their opponents because they're so aggressive because they're so down to fight at any moment's notice. They don't give a fuck. They're not afraid. They're ready to throw down, and because of that, that's a significant advantage. It's a significant tactic when it comes to fighting and they're not going to relinquish that just because they're on national television. So if someone gets some other boys' faces and disrespects them, they're kind of fight.

Speaker 1:          00:05:57       I mean, that's just what's going to happen. So what I blame is I think mayhem certainly made an error, but you should've never been allowed to get into the position to make that error. It was completely, in my opinion, on strikeforce or the committee or whoever the fuck is supposed to be watching that cage, you know, I don't know who's responsible for that. The UFC takes care of all that shit. I never have to think about it. But whoever was responsible for that, it was a god disaster. So that's, uh, that's my, my opinion on that. And as far as like the commentary goes and if people were talking about how bad the commentary is, this is what I'm think about that I like frank shamrock. I liked Francek frank shamrock as a person. I enjoy them. I think he's funny. Um, I don't mind this commentary at all those other two dudes.

Speaker 1:          00:06:41       So like my mom said, if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all. So I'm not gonna say Shit because I think those guys need work, you know, it's not as easy as it looks and you got to be a fan of the sport. And um, I'm not sure that the main guys a fan of the sport, I don't even want to mention his fucking name. So, um, here we are, this is the, the, the four slash 20 episodes of the podcast and what we'll do is I'll just ramble until everybody gets here already in it. He should be here within probably 15 to 20 minutes depending on what the traffic looks like and when they get here, then we'll jump off. So between now and then I'll just take questions. If you see my office here, if you notice it's things have changed.

Speaker 1:          00:07:25       I got rid of some shit here, move something out and I'm going to put a green screen behind me. So, uh, for the next ustream stream podcasts, uh, hopefully the next one if not the next one, the one after that I'll be in space. So the way we're going to have it set up is we're going to have a podcast, then I'm going to, how I'm going to have a green screen, I'm going to have a, a total space background and then I'll have couches and shit like that. So the idea is that it'll look like couches flying through space. And so that should be pretty interesting. This whole thing is, you know, I started out this podcast sort of just kind of as a roof and uh, you know, I just thought it'd be an interesting thing to do. I'd always wanted to do something like that.

Speaker 1:          00:08:06       I always enjoyed radio, but uh, I kind of never got off my ass to do it. And now I've done it. I think this is like the twelfth or the 13th week in a row. So, uh, we've been real consistent and uh, it's been a lot of fun. And now it's number eight on the comedy section of Itunes, which is crazy because the audio part of it was just sort of an afterthought to throw that up. And ustream one is getting plenty of it's and it's, um, it's good fun. It's a fun way to supplement, you know, comedy. And I'm speaking academy. I got one Gig, uh, this Friday night and Sacramento, but it's already sold out. I'm going to be doing the color commentary for a joe say Aldo versus Uriah Faber. Um, the, uh, the, I don't think they're, they're literally not even referring to it as the WEC.

Speaker 1:          00:08:54       They're just referring to it as although versus favor, I'm not exactly sure why that is. I think, you know for now because it's because the preliminary is going to be on spike TV lot, a lot, a lot of corporate shit. So that's what's going on. I got a bunch of stuff to talk about. First of all, this fucking volcano over Iceland is nuts. If you haven't noticed that there's a. my wife had no idea what was going on because she doesn't pay attention to shit except for gossip. But uh, the uh, there's a, a giant volcano in Iceland. It literally is erupting through the ice. It's pretty bad ass. We look at some of the video footage online. If you google it, it's really pretty intense. You seeing like molten lava squirting up through the ice is really wild and the volcanic ash has gotten so bad that they have canceled all the air flight, uh, over Europe for days and days.

Speaker 1:          00:09:53       Oh, our spheres here. How'd you get in? Oh, beautiful. Right for this place out. I did. See, ladies and gentlemen, he's here. Eddie Bravo shouldn't be moments behind. I'm sure he's very close. Could even ring the doorbell. No, he didn't. I didn't even hear it. Not so much a rambling. We're talking about the, um, the Iceland volcano and you know that. I'm not sure. Nobody can fly anywhere today. They just lifted it, but I wouldn't fucking fly it fully. Yeah. They lifted the air, the air band over Europe, but that's because it's costing them $200, million dollars a day. You know? How many is that? The airline industry in this country. I know. It's all crazy. $200. Million dollars a day. How about that? How fragile is this world and any little thing can happen and things closed down for a couple of days. And these businesses there, they run so on the edge that just a couple days off work and they to come close to being bankrupt.

Speaker 1:          00:10:55       I like people like fucking hurls doors with his full carrier can't fly home. And I'm like, you know what? We could've had all life. White people have no idea what volcanoes are all about. Volcanoes have reshaped this earth. Like when you're in Hawaii, you get, if you ever got the line yet, we've gone over the volcano and a helicopter. It's the fucking coolest thing ever. Uh, I went to the big island and we took a trip on a helicopter and we flew over the volcano and you're flying over this active volcano. You're watching the lava bubble up inside. You can see the fucking line, you can see it and you could see it roll into the ocean. Like we fly over to where it rolls in the ocean. It's moving four inches every year closer to Japan, fucking crazy. And there's another island, there's another island in the middle of the ocean that hasn't quite popped up yet, but it's on its way.

Speaker 1:          00:11:49       It's going to be the next island and the Hawaiian islands underneath on its way. It's building up. That whole area is just one gigantic stuff comes out. It just draws your eyes and it becomes a, it becomes rock and then it breaks down and becomes dirt and plants grow on it. Yeah, I mean it literally is that, that's what Hawaii is. It's a volcano and it just came out of the ground and, and created islands, but you could see the fucking volcano and they have all these different photos that you could buy there and videos you could watch out. There's a bunch of towns that were completely wiped out on the big island where they'll show you where the town used to be. The lava just came rolling in like the fifties and just crush the entire town. I think it happened in the 18 bullets.

Speaker 1:          00:12:35       I'm going to catch up. I didn't see any of that, but I'm sure there must be. I mean, most of the stuff just gets smushed. The lot of that comes down. It's just literally annihilates any evidence whatsoever that anything was there as well. People don't realize is that she just happened so many times. You know, this world has changed so many times, just in the last few million years. The, um, the best place to find mega donald skeletons. Meglawn teeth. You know what a mega is there? The, these giant, ancient prehistoric sharks. They're like fucking way bigger than great wines. Well, the best place to find their teeth is in Montana recovers. It used to be the ocean. How fucking fucking crazy Montana used to be under water, you know, so many parts of let's just, uh, just like 10,000 years ago, half of North America was under a mile high sheet of ice just 10,000 years ago.

Speaker 1:          00:13:35       That's nothing. That's nothing. Ten thousand years is nothing. Ten thousand years ago they were saber tooth tigers and woolly mammoths because you know, that just 10,000 years ago, fucking Saber Tooth Tigers, 10,000 years isn't shit. There are people around them. What was the $10,000 for that? We don't know. Ten thousand years before that. I mean, it was sort of human civilization. It's all who the fuck knows. I mean, we know that the big extinction was 65 million years ago. That was the, you know, the one that hit the Yucatan, the big meteor or girl that wiped out supposedly wiped out everything. So small mammals and anything bigger than like a fucking hamster was go. Why were they figured out a way to burrow underground and hardy rats and shit like that, you know, rats or some party animals, you know, and we're like the descendants of anything that survived 65 million years while the rest will, all sorts of mammals. I mean, and some birds, I mean just dinosaurs are direct to set or birds or direct descendant of dinosaurs. Somehow or another, some birds survive, but literally most of the life on the planet was wiped the fuck out. And then there's the super volcanoes, men super volcanoes and been wiping out things on this continent for millions and millions of years. Every six to 800,000 years of yellowstone blows up and literally wipes out the whole continent, kills everything whenever we started speaking. And there's been 2000 earthquakes in yellowstone national park since January of this year

Speaker 2:          00:15:04       of earthquakes. And how there's so many more now. Is that true? No, no, exactly the same. Just happened to big cities.

Speaker 1:          00:15:12       Really? Yeah. So there's the same amount. It's just a hitting places where people.

Speaker 2:          00:15:16       Yeah, and if it happens, I mean if you had an earthquake in Bakersfield, as long as the damage, if we get it on the corner of sunset and Fairfax, it's going to be tremendous, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:15:27       but it seems like there's so many of them. They seemed like a lot. Is that because of, uh, the news, like there's more access to information now.

Speaker 2:          00:15:36       Last year was the year of celebrity death, you know, it wasn't, know it never had before, but it just keeps happening. I shouldn't have done it last year with Jackson. That chick that was hot. It was a choice. Angeles, that's your legacy chick. That was hard. It was in Charlie's angels. Oh yeah. Did he died last year or this year? Because we did that episode about beer. Slippery. They're already talking about it openly and we talked about it. A bunch of celebrities are dying, but it's not, it's just, I think it's just tmz makes more people. Celebrities.

Speaker 1:          00:16:12       That's true. You know, there's, there's way more celebrities down in there before. Do you know gangster rap band. Gangsta Guru from gang starr just die.

Speaker 2:          00:16:21       You don't give a fuck. Did I just barely existed? Already knew is that you never heard him sing their songs. You don't sing or rap. One of the stories. I'll play you one second. Video Guru, but a great person. There might be one of the best like lyrical bands, the 99 populous and he died last night, apparently had cancer and now you just got this accompany cancer. 40th three bucks. That's like me. I'm almost 43 artists trying to natural causes not get hit by a fucking shit. Just gave us a song. So he was, he was not seen in true romance where these, like a year ago Williams not. Yeah. So it was Christopher walken and in the air, the guy, uh, so you people know who the guy from. What was he going to remember that movie? That was awesome. Waterworld believed that Jesus Christ, he's under 100 pounds. Wow. Can be hot.

Speaker 2:          00:18:23       But the weirdest fucking thing in the world is these women that think they're being super skinny, like anorexic is hot. That shit is disgusting. It's more some people like how could have fucking any guide like that. That's so anti nature nature. You want a woman that has a fatter ass. You want her to take tests, she can milk the baby. You want to have her answer. She can survive the pregnancy. Those are all like dessert, but those things are good, but that's why those things are there. That traffic tickets, the reason why they're attractive, it's like actions

Speaker 1:          00:19:06       because that's too much. That's obese. That's unhealthy, but a little bit of fat is good. Like a little fat fast. Just like Tony. That's not good because they can't move around. Good. You want athletic, but you want some fat on them. That's what it is. It's all nature. It's all leftover shit. I mean, think about how easy it is to trick your system. How about fake tits? We know they're fake. We know there's a bag of plastic underneath your skin, but still it makes you. It looks hotter. They poke out and they look ridiculous like that poor fucking girl. What is her name? Heidi Montag. Do you know what machines is? Yeah, he don't. He doesn't pay attention. He's the anti gossip man, but there's a heidi mom tag chick is a. she's one of those celebrities for just being a celebrity, like you're not exactly sure why she.

Speaker 1:          00:19:57       She just had 10 plastic surgeries altogether. She had her chin on her tits done. She had all these shirts that are worth. Some people say she looks better, but I didn't think she looked bad to begin with. She just had to kind of a big chin, like sorta like a Jay Leno thing going on. But she was pretty like, you know, like she didn't have to do that. Like it doesn't make you look better. It just makes you like different. Definitely sluttier. She had big tents to begin with. She had a big fake tits and she got giant one, so now they're like ridiculous. Like they look stupid. I like a solid suit. Sounds good. It's amazing. But it's like crazy. Crazy book. Yeah. When you see girls who have. It's so funny, like La is so fucked up with fake test that you see girls got real tense of the kind of like sagging. Show those what's wrong. While

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       it's just like, that's normal, let's go look at fucking videos of Africa. You know, you're not supposed to have these, these missile tests that stick straight out of your chest. That shit's not normal. I think they look real nice, but I grew up in like a feed with the two. It's still hanging out a little bit. Just pull it just looked like they did when they were pointing. It's amazing though, how, how easy it is to trick us sunglasses. It was good to me. More of those people, you know, it's like you've got the right surgery, right? You look great. To me more is 47 years old and she still looks God. How the fuck is she doing that? I saw that. That's incredible. The model with the book there shirt, but it's not that much in person. She was at a UFC maybe two years ago, so she's be 47, 48.

Speaker 2:          00:21:39       She's hot as fuck dude. Still, you know, I'm sure the vaginas just done. I'm sure this is drives. Fuck yeah. There's no more blood coming out of that time. There's no more periods. 15 when you had 15, that's a wrap. No more periods. That means you're not oscillating means you're not really able to have babies anymore. Your body starts to fuck off. You're just shooting loads into a cemetery and shooting those into a casket. Got that in there. It's still it's intelligent trick. You might as well be fucking a rubber doll. I mean you're having sex with a person that's all well and good, but as far as like you shooting a load inside of her, it's a total waste of time,

Speaker 1:          00:22:14       but we don't want to. I'm not saying that, but I'm saying like for nature it's like a Jew. I mean the only reason why sex feels good is to trick you into fucking so that you make

Speaker 2:          00:22:26       would say with a Jewish mystical theory about what he wants to know when you pull out or when you masturbate, your semen is said to have been pregnant at some demon will make. It's like they're like appearance right here and she just fucking you as your last rating redness. Then when you get to heaven or 40 of them in this purgatory level, you have to face all your kids and they're like, why? Why couldn't we be born real people and they're all like formed and mangled and you have to answer all of them. Oh my God.

Speaker 1:          00:23:00       That might be the greatest story. How come on? How Much Kabbalah? Because they taught me this when you were a child and other people that don't know are you spent a bunch of years and is used as a seriously religious man? Like read the Torah. How many hours a day?

Speaker 2:          00:23:17       When I was in Israel, I don't know, 10, 12,

Speaker 1:          00:23:21       12 hours a day. Reading the Torah. We're going to have to fire up the volcano for that. Son got paid to go ahead and this is great, man. You really revamped. Oh Dude. I'm turning this into a real studio. Did a solo. It took like 12 hours. I did have people help me get rid of the desk. Ladies and gentlemen, if you ever heard of a volcano, you know what a volcano is. A volcano is a vaporizing device and what a vaporizer and you know, the big argument about thc about marijuana in general is that you shouldn't smoke and the smoke is bad for your lungs. Well, you don't have to smoke it, you can eat it, but eating is very tricky because he didn't get too fucked up because when you eat it, it's processed by the liver and it creates something called 11 hydroxy metabolite, which is four times more psychoactive than thc. And it's really a totally different experience, you know, that's why people get freaked out. That's why, you know, I'm sure a lot of you have seen that video where that dude, he's a cop and he calls up, um, the uh, nine slash 11 and says that he thinks he's dying because, because he and his girlfriend aid some pot brownies and uh, he says, time was moving really slow and he thinks he's dying. Well, let's see, gentlemen.

Speaker 3:          00:24:37       Oh,

Speaker 1:          00:24:40       to get the office cleaned. This mother Fucker, dude, I got rid of the desk and I'm turning this thing into a school. You, we live right now. There's over 2000 people. This is the biggest crowd we've ever had anywhere else. That's a vaporizers and vaporizers please gentlemen, it blows into this plastic bag and it looks like, like a, like a

Speaker 3:          00:24:59       no

Speaker 1:          00:25:01       Saran wrap or some shit and you just get pure thc vapor. And what it does is it heats up the little crystals on the thd and releases them and it comes out like missed. So there's no smoke at all. So there's no argument anymore. There's no negative health effects. I'm going to have two dedicated cameras in here and this is going to be a green screen and we're going to be in space. What I set this up within two weeks. This will all be green behind us. And then what we'll watch, it wouldn't be like we're flying to the universe on a couch because every episode is a different person than they were in Africa. So, uh, what we're talking about, we went over volcanoes. We went over, I went over strikeforce. I don't know if you've got any opinion on strikeforce. I said the whole reason why that brought took place is because they didn't, they didn't guard the cage, they didn't do a good job of making sure that nobody got in there.

Speaker 1:          00:26:00       That was the finance was like, I want to go this bottom, like this spice done. It's over and over one. Well, and what may have went in there and talked with jake shields was in the cage and said, Yo, Jay, but am I getting the rematch? Gilbert Melendez push made him out of the way. The Diaz brothers jumped, may, have, may have pushed up, jumped in. It was a brawl to lose kicking him. When he was down, it was like four people on. Um, Eric Apple took jake shields and got them out of there and push them over to the other sides and being involved in the Bra. I mean, it was a fucking a bench clearing brawl. So it was pretty awesome. That was a great. There's a great picture online where someone from the audience captured it on their phone or something where jake shields and nick are coming.

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       It's like from behind change or behind me. Yeah, it's a great. Yeah, man was standing there and Nick Diaz is like this and jake shields is like that. Gilbert Melendez on the other side, those fucking dudes, they have a lot of unity and I respect that and you know, and everybody's like, oh, there is

Speaker 1:          00:27:03       isn't there, this and that. Well, you got to realize, man, these dudes are fucking professional cage fighters. Right? During their scrapping with each other every day they're down to die for each other. The reputation is hugely important. They're not going to fucking back down. They're not going to have a situation where they look like a bitch. They're not going to allow someone to think of them. Anybody who think that their buddy got disrespected but they didn't do anything about it. That's not gonna happen. So any, any sort of a situation like that where we're all takes place. I played fucking strikeforce. I blame strikeforce for allowing that to get to that deposition. Allowing those fucking do to get into the cage. Was abroad the comments or last week? Yeah, there were some. That's people that everyone's scared of. They him to leave and it lit up as far as the front patio and allegory. I was scared. They were like, just call the cops and get them out of here, but they wouldn't do it. Eventually fight broke out and some of the let's go put front and I saw the fight and I'm like, I don't want to get involved with this. I don't get stabbed for someone else already. Let's go fight. Well, it's like everybody, like everybody in as the enforcer now,

Speaker 2:          00:28:11       seriously come on for the reasons that some guys were like, oh, so how long have you been doing? Did you choke me out? You might be the baddest motherfucker. Did you hear what Gus Johnson sale under Johnson said, somebody I. This hasn't been confirmed, but I'm just going to say it because I hope it's true. Gus Johnson, who's the guy who's the black dude, he does the commentary. Strikeforce made a bunch of errors called like arm bars. I was like, this. See this, ladies and gentlemen, see the fogging that that's missed. Well, anyway, this reporter called them up and ask him about it. I think it was Mike Russell, his name, and he said, listen dog, I know the Gypsy bar. Kamala Khan more. I trained. He said, if you want to come down and roll with me, I'll show you the difference. Like he's challenging guys to roll with it. Like he trades like Gus Johnson on the Internet. Yes. Mike Russell on the Internet yet? No, it's too far. We can pull the scores but it. But we put close to. The problem is there's three of us here can read it. They can't read it. We don't have to read it. You could just talk. We got to pay attention to the audience. Yeah, but you can't pay attention to the audience and keep a conversation going at the same time.

Speaker 2:          00:29:31       Yeah. That's not really questioning. Lumped it all.

Speaker 2:          00:29:36       Yeah. Have be great if like if the dea busted. We're all legal. We have prescription. Yeah. Were legal and I wouldn't mind some are crackers back up and I'll fill the bag up again more seriously though. Seriously, because there's the 4:20 episodes we should be allowed to have like order pizza during the show. It's for 20. We're getting high, like snacking on shit that fucks up with the flux of the conversation. Never had a great conversation and eating pizza. But yeah, but people are watching this conversation. This conversation is like a show, but I'm talking about how it all started. I said, why don't you just go walk into my kitchen and just go scrounge around the way we've got a show to do something where people order pizza pizza later and the idea will be the pizza comes right before we killed this now.

Speaker 2:          00:30:46       Okay, how dare you motherfuckers. So I'm artist telling us something hilarious. Listen to this shit. Stop. Need to, need to be focusing on show sun. Ra was telling us that there's a, an ancient Jewish, whatever the fuck it is, Jewish mystical thought. There's a waste. The waste statement. So, um, they say when you pull out and not really math, reading your fucking woman was nothing. Just like a ghost. And when you go, when you go through a place, all your kids would have been born in the real life. Even a woman. And like, like why did you pull out? We want him to be born real boys.

Speaker 2:          00:31:33       Didn't have any kids. You've got a building. You've got a billion monster babies. I think it's per load. You're like fucking one Venus? I think so. So how many games do you think you got? Dammit, I'm going to have a much more efficient set up here as well with this gentleman when we get back on an average day for weeks. My belief, since you shouldn't six loads a week, sometimes more than one of those. Do you ever feel like a loser when you get to live? If I jerk off more than once a day that I'm just obsessed. Bad. That's bad. Obviously. I'm not morning already. Jerked off. I know, but why? Why? Just sit there like a monkey?

Speaker 4:          00:32:40       Yeah. While you're fucking. You know, you'd be bad at reading, spreading the seed that's ready to seed. You're jerking off into a Napkin. Vagina. Then if there was a good job to do, no one has ever said no. I'd rather just check off. I'm sorry.

Speaker 2:          00:33:02       Telling you that masturbation is so bad that you're fucking. That's like the worst case scenario. You're having sex with the demon and make it half demon babies that are going to be waiting for you when you die to scream and yell at you. That is because the institution of marriage, they want that. That helps religion people making units and it's amazing though. Like what? Why do they give a fuck? I don't know. Why don't you give a fuck if you masturbate? What is, what is it about masturbation? About no masturbation, you know that somehow or another equates to them having more control over you with the more you don't have to pay, the more you want. Fuck, fuck. Women face. So the results of Vegas, the morning mass with Less Vegas. So that's got to be example why the Catholic Church doesn't want you to any birth control too, right?

Speaker 2:          00:33:49       Yes. That makes sense. Yeah. Well it's definitely way for someone when they have kids. I feel that myself. I feel like I'm easier to control now that you have kids, when you, when you have kids and you want everything to be nice, you know you want everything to be easy. I don't want any drama, you know, turn them like this, but man it a demon babies, you're, you're, you're fucking demon thing. They came up with the worst story ever. You fucking a demon and you make babies that are half demon and they're waiting for you when you die. What the fuck man, Mr stuff.

Speaker 4:          00:34:24       It's like, why stop? Because you know, by the time we figured that out, you've already checked off like a thousand times 50,000 demons. I'm fucked either way. Might as well enjoy this. Be something you could do to cancel out the other demons to make up for it. There's got to be like, what if you let it lie at 12 babies you know with, with your wife, but masquerade three times you get to heaven. You have three little dema babies. You're still gonna like tasks

Speaker 2:          00:34:56       do on earth that cancel out your demon babies because they're.

Speaker 4:          00:35:00       There's got to, there's got to me. Because what about people that are trying to convert to this religion? I would, I that the Jews don't give a fuck. I already got $75,000 recruiting religion ever. They don't give a fuck. We tried to convince me not to do it. Yeah. They make it really hard. Also is a Jewish thing. It's like a regular Jewish. You were saying all of them. You don't want to lie. I never heard of this before. I never heard of it either you, your old tests, but they're like chapter. It is the Torah.

Speaker 2:          00:35:35       Fairly decent study that took like 10 hours a, you know, you remember when David was the king of the Jews are so powerful that they wouldn't allow any conversions. Wow. There were like no one's doing cameras get that's deep. And you guys, uh, um, what do you guys think of Jesus that he was a real person, spoke about things. He was, it was a, like a sort of a wise man, but they went off the deep end. So they look down on Christianity for choosing Jesus as their savior and Lord. Uh, yes, they're excited that none of those other shoes. It's so funny how they're all sort of, kind of connected like Judaism just Sorta, Kinda connected with Christianity included. That's why the, um, all the really conservative fundamentalist Christians wanted to control Israel and support Israel to believe in the rapture and they believed that when the shit goes down best place to be like you have to protect them, but they believe that they're wrong.

Speaker 2:          00:36:38       Even though the Bible says that they're the chosen people, the Christians to go, yeah, but you guys kept the story. I'll fucked up. We got it right and don't be an awesome thing for the Jews. If it came out, the Jesus actually never existed. Wouldn't be like, dude, you guys, he never even existed. That would have been crushed. The Christian truth. Do they have that Jesus documents, man, and apparently that's very much a debate very much in debate. Yeah. There's a lot of scholars to do not believe he was an actual person because they believe that Jesus existed but just wasn't mad. Jews believe that Jesus existed and he was mad and it would make it would benefit their costs because they'll kill each other if slicing each other. If you weren't their religion. I believe that they were the former Rep. the great rabbis would talk about what we will do it that makes me think that he, even though there isn't that much proof that he actually wants to live in, there's a lot of holes and that went bed and the guy that never was all that shit.

Speaker 2:          00:37:41       You. How come? How come the Jews and the Muslims don't jump on that? Jesus Christ never existed. Well, I exactly. So that makes me think damn. He probably was a man who was a bad motherfucker. Who knows? Who knows? But the issue is you can't send false prophets. They said there's many way. The guy existed for sure. He didn't walk on water and come back from the dead. That was like a. like someone thinking Bruce Lee could really beat up 50 people like Bruce Lee, the real guy, and Bruce Lee the superstar to different people. But it's how many people think their life on some story that would not make any fucking sense. You told it today, like if you told that story today and said there was a dude who walked on water and came back from dead. Everybody wouldn't go. Just shut the fuck up. That's ridiculous, but because it's 2000 years ago, everybody's like, oh, that's, you could be happy. It's not like anything like rational people that you talk to that would. There was a

Speaker 1:          00:38:35       guy that we, when we're doing fear factor, who, uh, we did a family fear factor. We came to people's houses and made him do things and we traveled all across the country. This dude was a teacher. He was a fucking math teacher and he was telling me like scientifically that, that Jesus existed because you can prove it because they, they, they've looked at molecules that are too complex to just occurred naturally. This is a super, that's a ridiculous argument and this is super, super smart guy. And I was listening to them talk, you know, supposedly super smart guy and I was listening to this guy talking like how it is that, but this guy can't see that. He believes in some reason you can say any courses assistant because something is too amazing to exist. National debt does not. It's not true system. I draw a picture of Jesus and with the capture, this is Jesus.

Speaker 1:          00:39:21       That's better, right, but you can never say that. Nothing can exist naturally. You don't know the power of nature. Nature is absolutely ridiculous. Completely unpredictable. There's subatomic particles that blink in and out of existence all the time. They appeared in two places at once. This is science, real shit. We know that exists in nature. There's the whole pattern of nature is gigantic. The FIBONACCI sequence that you see in Pine cones and pineapples and all sorts of different plants and existence, human facial features, and this is like a mathematical code to all this stuff. It doesn't mean that there's a fucking dude pressing the button. It might mean that the whole thing is just super complicated and conscious. They did press in the but that there's a god, there's a duke. We would want to break it down to like someone like us. We want to like make a super version of us that's running for.

Speaker 1:          00:40:13       Yeah, you're talking about that. The old man with the beard and the sky. Jesus every. I'll know for sure. Of course. Of course. That's amazing. I know of course, but it sounded like you were saying that you were describing how wonderful the universities and the FIBONACCI theories and how it's all like this code and structure it to be a doctor like. To me that was like that. There is an intelligent other side that is way too complex for us to understand and this is what I don't think it is. I mean it could be that everything has an intelligence about what it is as a single entity. I think it's much more likely than an interconnected thing. We totally gray slacks like ocean when the ocean and then we're like little water molecules, but it's the ocean. It's all. Exactly. That's what psychedelic experiences we like. It feels like you're in the ocean sometimes. It feels like you're all connected all around you to something that you don't see those mushrooms. I never told you. I didn't find myself on a fucking Thursday night. I decided to a party by myself. Did. I took all those fucking mushrooms. I got pictures and everything and from the whole thing, that wasn't five grands.

Speaker 5:          00:41:34       No, no, no. It wasn't five. I've got five grams before that was like three and a half, so I did them all myself and I'm just want to let you know. It was. It was pretty fucking insane. It was insane, but not as intense is. It would have been five brands. It was pretty intense, but the five grants was like dnt. Five grams really is that threshold point. Boom. That was about a year and a half ago when I did the five grams and fucking I was at a zoo and I just woke up in the zoo. I thought doing mushrooms at the zoo would be fucking awesome. You know what I mean? Outdoors. You did mushrooms, go out in nature zoo, but that is like anti nature. Fuck. I freaked the fuck out. Get the fuck out. You feel like you were in prison if you were watching their sorrow for sure. Like we just had to get the fog out.

Speaker 1:          00:42:27       Super negative. Man. I feel terrible when I go to the zoo. I do not like it at all and it makes me feel bad. I used to enjoy it because I used to enjoy caring for the animals, but then one time I went one time when I was super baked and when I did what I did when I was super vague, I got really. I felt terrible. I got really sad. I thought it was a terrible, terrible thing to do or doing was just taking these animals and shoving them in these cages and they don't even get to do it and they just pace.

Speaker 5:          00:42:56       Had a polar bear at the La Zoo. He'll just pace back and forth by that back door, just waiting for that fucking back white door, like fake ice and then a white dog, white dog. That's crazy. That's horrible. Man. Mad and I freaked out. Went out to the parking lot and this chick I was with me, we did the exact same thing and we saw the exact same. We looked at the mountains. We would stop in the middle of a parking lot because everything was connected. It was all connected to look at this guy. This guy were dancing before and as tech writing, we look at the mountains in the distance, like miles away, like passively in the mountains and all of a sudden Aztec pattern. The former, the Aztec pattern. There's, what are you seeing? What are you seeing as the Aztec patterns? Dense look at stuff.

Speaker 5:          00:43:51       The clouds, the clouds are in their spot for a second and then they formed. And I remember connor telling me, because congress is the one who turned me onto the dude who had him. He, uh, a sentencing. He goes, dude, it's not the cloud's going to dance for you. Wow. I didn't even pay attention to that really badly. We get in the fucking car. Swear to God. I was driving on the freeway freaking out. I didn't know if there was cars next to me on the side of me, but it really did look like as I was driving on the freeway, like, like it wasn't like I was in the what dreams may come. Remember that Shit. I was driving on the and it

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       was like rose petals and like bushes would form in front of my car. I'm driving really rose pedals and bushes. It was fucking insane by the way. We don't want to encourage. I just wanted to get. I just trying to get home with terrible mistake. Exactly how I want her to do is get them all getting my little fucking dark room and just close my eyes and enjoy that life show because that night's show was fucking insane. The twirling. But you just kind of explain it. It's just fucking. And that's all I want. I want to see. Why do you think that you see certain like religious symbolism and Hindu shit and food an I got it from. You think that's where they must be doing mushrooms since the dawn of time. Of course. That's when I looked at him like that's where all this shit comes from.

Speaker 4:          00:45:24       Alex Grey Shit telling you that's where it's coming from. These old like, you know those things that I have in my office, the Gouda those birds, you know those, you know what I'm talking about. And the media room. I noticed there's crazy psychedelic furs and when, when I did the DMT ones much, I saw those things. I saw like that imagery and then when I went to a store and saw them for sale, I'm like, oh my God, whoever created that thing, like was there. Like they had to have seen that. Like you could see that first. You could say, well why is that? I don't know. I mean, is it something that's already there? We just can't tune into it until we take psychedelics? Or is it the same hallucination happens to every person that takes a drug. I think. I mean, I don't know. I think that it's just, it opens up your sense that somehow to this other dimension or all these dimensions that are all around us and like we're, we're in a radio and we're only tuned into 97 point one.

Speaker 4:          00:46:27       It has an infinite number of stations. We're just going into another space where that's possible is that I think it just fucks with the branding. Two things were possible. I don't, I don't personally think that. I don't think that. I don't think the shit that I'm seeing. I don't know. Interesting, but the shit that with five grand, five grand, but the chicken, what you is for me, who knows? It seems impossible for me to bring that up in my brain like it's just the most beautifully constructed flowing shapes of random and you don't really. You're not high. You close your eyes and see like random blackness and there's no pattern. It's just like we might see who lit type flashes of light, but when you close your eyes, I'm not sure. All of a sudden there's this show that's about a thousand times more complex than that. Visualize it. You've got an item and that's pretty fucking cool. That visualized. It's in that same vein but a thousand times more complex way more complex and I'm like,

Speaker 1:          00:47:31       I'm not designing this. I'm not controlling this. There's someone else controlling someone else's making this shit, not me. It seems like that's definitely one option, but another option is that stuff supercharges your perceptions and just makes your imagination more hypersensitive and it makes your brain go wild because it reacts with, you know, the size that you use to see things as a parasite.

Speaker 2:          00:47:55       It lives in the sewers and it only feeds on cat springs. So what it does is it took a worm, right? Yeah. But it lets. I'm a rat, Ethan and the at Burlington the brain and the only thing that changes the wrap to the church and their behavior at all except it takes their way, their fear of cats. So they will get eaten by a cab. Everything else saying they gave and when they see a capital like, oh, what's up? Nothing major. Cat kills it. Uh, yeah. That's incredible. And that's his brains. I know.

Speaker 1:          00:48:26       Totally fine. We talked about this one on the show. The other one that they do where there's a worm that gets inside of grasshopper, convinced the grasshopper, he commit suicide so that it can hatch out of the spot it grows and how it gets it teaches the grasshopper to jump into the water and kill itself. It's an aquatic warm, so it has to be hatched in the fucking water or things like that. That's just crazy. That's just like existing on a whole new level of like, just that alone right there is so fucking amazing. It's so amazing. It's just another like, you know, there's something going on. They started growing up I think. Well there's definitely something going on, but I think our, our idea that our culture is based on, it's just that we wanted to be close to us. We want it to be like a super version of us, which is why would a, God is like a super version of a human, but you know, with all these rules and God is, you know, fucking kind of addictive and gets pissed at you if you fuck up and a lot of religions is willing to kill you if you don't listen to them.

Speaker 1:          00:49:30       You know, we want it like a super version of box, but it's much more possible that this, this whole thing is just connected to something that you can't stop. You know, some big, powerful thing that feeds off itself. All, every, everything. This world has a role and plays a part in this thing. It's just we're used to it. We don't realize how funny it really fucking is because we're used to it because it's just a normal part of our day and people get used to anything. People in Africa have giant plates. They stick in their lips and all the girls do it. They're used to it. We just get used to stupid shit and once we're used to something then everything's become spine. And then we think that there's some sort of a grand order. Things,

Speaker 1:          00:50:11       you know, it's, it's really getting weirder and weirder. As I got older, as I got older and I look at, you know, our culture and I look at life on this planet. I look at my own mortality, you know, the fact that I'm like, you know, the next half of my life is going to be half of my life were. My buddies will work good. You know, that's just the way it is. Getting close to dying. You know you're going to have health issues if you don't watch your diet, you know you're going to make. You have to make sure you get the proper sleep or you might get heart attacks and shit like things start going wrong. Even when you, when you really start assessing this whole big picture of what this really is like, God, it's like I feel I've been flying without a manual for so long, like just operating my life. Not really having any idea how to do it correctly just but learning from my fuck ups starting from scratch. We look. I feel like there's such. It's going to be a way better way to learn life than the way we do it. So is there a time you can get yourself and your own personality figured out and you're rolling the way he interacts with people, figuring out. By the time you get that figured out so god, you're already dying

Speaker 1:          00:51:20       age. They think, Oh, if I know what I do now, and I go back to that age and you get laid so much. Oh God, yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:51:26       Yeah. Look like you were 34, like 30 years. Yeah. Let we figured that shit on now. More advancement.

Speaker 1:          00:51:38       Skincare for men. It seems like you're not supposed to live long enough to figure this out. It seems like the reason why turtles live to be a thousand years old and people live to be 100 is because we're not supposed to have a thousand years toward us. Discovery, all the funding,

Speaker 4:          00:51:58       little geographic today,

Speaker 1:          00:52:04       thousand years old. So they literally lived like back when people were writing fucking what was the thousand year old kid?

Speaker 4:          00:52:12       They should put like little black box

Speaker 1:          00:52:17       you to write everything out on paper. I've written out a thousand years ago. They might've been doing on animal skins to a lot. No, that's crazy. You know like the Dead Sea Scrolls. That shit was all written on animal skins. Those motherfuckers didn't even know paper. They didn't even have paper back. There could be a dead sea. Scroll on a fucking turtle.

Speaker 4:          00:52:44       I wish I knew for sure who's

Speaker 1:          00:52:46       telling the truth about the Dead Sea scrolls because I don't have enough time to learn ancient Hebrew or what does an era. Man, I can go back and read the Dead Sea Scrolls and decipher for myself, but there's all this dispute on what the Dead Sea Scrolls actually means and some people say that it contains all kinds of nutty shit like fucking Ufo shows and flying saucers and I mean there's, there's guys who have decided from the Dead Sea Scrolls, like the John Marco Lego guy says it's all about mushrooms. You said it was about was them. Even the them scary mushroom and fertility rituals and he breaks it all down like the origins of the words, but people argue against him and I don't know who's right. It's too fucking live there on ABC. They all the best scientists on the planet and all the best linguists they get together.

Speaker 4:          00:53:31       That should be important. That's discipleship in front of the world as a satellite feed from fucking

Speaker 1:          00:53:38       allegro passed away. The Guy who wrote that book, but he was the. He was the one of the head guys for the Dead Sea Scrolls. You worked on it for 14 years and he was the only agnostic in the group. You know, they had a bunch of people that were ordained ministers and they were to decipher is then we're all religious people and he started out a religious person, but when you started studying theology you realized somewhere along the line is obviously bullshit and she just became agnostic, so he looked at the whole, the whole picture completely different than all the other guys. So they all were refuted his findings. But there's a lot of people that say he's right and a lot of people will say that. He was the head scholar. He was the number one dude. If he was the guy who had it all, like he was the guy who was looking at it objectively and everybody else was looking at it with a religious slant because fucking guys thinks it was all about mushrooms.

Speaker 1:          00:54:24       It was all about psychedelic mushrooms that they would do it, hide these mushrooms from the Romans, and they would hide like what does the magic and with the mushrooms can do and the way they hid it from him, Mrs. Stories. And they didn't even write it down for like a thousand years. They just told each other as a story for a thousand years, so it just became all fucked up and so he breaks down like ancient words. Keith, he broke down the word Christ. He brought it back to an ancient Sumerian word that means a mushroom covered in God's semen. Nice. Because they, when they thought it was raining, I was coming on the earth. That's why things would come up out of the earth, like come wasn't bad debt. So like when God would reign and he was coming on the earth, these mushrooms would just appear because they didn't have microscopes, they didn't know what a fucking lie a spore is. They couldn't see microscopic things, so they didn't see any seed or anything. And also these big mushrooms appeared like the next day they grow quick and they start eating them and they tripped their fucking balls. They don't want anybody else to know about this. So they tried to hide the information. They were told either a high keeping it from their enemies. Wow. Isn't that nuts? God Zurich it off. Isn't that. That's how they used to look at him or did he pull out some guidance

Speaker 4:          00:55:41       somehow? You've got to figure out, Daddy, you got to

Speaker 1:          00:55:48       so good to have a baby right now. Think about how good it feels to have a baby right now. It's an amazing, incredible feelings, but most babies now, they live. They live to be grownups, ups to be adults. They don't have to worry about them getting eaten by lions. You don't have to worry about plague, but the people that live back then had the same love for the kids as we do now, but they couldn't help it, so there were people were dying left and right, but there's nothing you can do to stop it. That must have been nuts, man. That must've been fucking horrifying. Having kids just got well, must be why they had all these rituals. It was fertility. Rituals are so important. They wanted to have as many kids as possible.

Speaker 1:          00:56:34       Roman times, 50 percent perhaps the people that have the damn before, what? Adulthood that's can get it. Only half of them make it turned out that the condition he imagined what it was or something like that. That was on discovery. So I don't know. The history channel. Don't quote me on that. Like oh no, that makes sense. I don't remember that. Even if it wasn't 50 percent, it had to be a high number. I mean they just didn't have someone check that mortality rate and Roman times. I think it's 50 percent could be wrong. Dude, I've had two major surgeries. Both my knees reconstructed, both acs and one more minor surgery. My meniscus surgery on my hand, but if I lived, you know, thousand years ago, I'd be fucked, man. That'd be fucked. You wouldn't be doing Jujitsu? No. That wouldn't have happened to run into him. Plan to work it. You learned have been a softball champions.

Speaker 1:          00:57:35       Softball. I smashed my biggest. There's guys out there. They're fucking champions in softball. Like they're the fucking Mark Mcguire. A softball. There's guys out there. We'll do this. That create those. Who is the Hicks and Gracie to find that out. It's been great. So softball that. How accurate can you be when you whip that fucking thing around? It looks dope. That's nuts. Then checks because it all. I don't think I've ever seen the chicks throw that hard regular. Have you ever seen a chick throw it was clearly the right way to do it? Yeah. Why did they throw into narrative that's like, no, it's like it's like breaking the balls and pool. You know how you try to break the balls really hard. She wants like a little person. They have like a loose wrist and just smash is like a timing to it where they're just knowing exactly how to put their weight into it and just not like.

Speaker 1:          00:58:29       It's weird, like Jujitsu should straighten things when it comes to techniques and it's like the more you do techniques, the more those techniques just becoming grain, the way your body moves. Your body just gets really good at the movement so you can teach your body move, which is like a j. shows control and credible founder Dan Henderson is a monster. He took. First of all, I'm just impressed. Fuck these first round. The first round he got face planted. He got bold, lasted like Henderson on the button. Oh, I do. I erased it. I arranged it. Henderson hit him on the bus. You have erased it. You get it online. We can get it online. Most will watch captured.

Speaker 1:          00:59:15       Henderson faceplant face plants a field, so blindly die for it. He got cracked and Dan Henderson hits him again for hard upper cut to an end. It goes down again. He got fucked up and that first one chance. But Danny came on strong in the second round and the tennis shoes started fade a little bit and jake shields started taking them down, fucking controlling them. And they were saying that, uh, that Henderson has been having problems with his back. So you know, he looked kind of stiff. That could have been what's going on. It could have been why couldn't, couldn't stuff that take job, but pants, shields a good total control mountain. I'm just a mountain of over and over again. And Henderson could not shake him, couldn't finish them, and never went for one arm bar. But that's it. Sports is 100 point. Oh my goodness. I have A. Yeah. This is ridiculous. We're not supposed to do I for 20. It's time to order pizza. No, wait, can we just tv know it just takes. They don't give a shit. They do though. Is people listening to this on itunes to at this point in time that already like, are we allowed to go? I bet no one says no one. It's like, yeah dude,

Speaker 4:          01:00:31       they're all looking at. Go for it. Please. Fuck. I need to get more pizza. Pizza, everyone. How come you haven't gotten an operation that your eyeballs fixed? Fuck you guys. Fuck you. Happy three 87.

Speaker 1:          01:01:00       Hey, how come you haven't got your eyeballs? Scared of that now and I'm not scared at all. I just haven't done it. Would you want to do with about you? Contrast is just so easy. Like I don't even know that I never even got caught. Sometimes they might contacts in three or four days and shit I don't think you're supposed to, but they don't. You want to get them fixed. Have the context. Tells me that I'm making up little things in your I now you can see better how it is. That means seeing is so fucking important and you can fix it with a little piece of plastic. How did they figure that shit? I didn't figure out contact. Someone figured that out. Jensen and to the counselor. I want to say a documentary to think about what all the shit that people can do right now. It's getting so crazy. What the fuck is going to be the next big thing because no one saw the internet coming, you know? No one ever thought it was going to affect people the way it's affecting the human race right now because if they did, they would've never let it get out. No, no, no. Corporations would have ever wanted the internet. It's too tricky. It was too hard to control. It's too. What? What the fuck is gonna be? The next thing is this isn't going to be the last day of the grantor. That's it.

Speaker 1:          01:02:28       Going to be like Hologram laptops where you're just going to need like maybe a little little block and then it just blows up or something. It's going to be New Orleans just happened. I think it's going to be neural implants or the other idea that I had was not a normal implant, but that they figured out the frequency of your brain. Like what if they beat your brain towards like a wifi signal, but what if your brain, like obviously you know, input comes into your brain in the form of hearing things and seeing things and these electrical impulses or wherever the hell sight and sound is created and how you represent that stuff in your head that's like, those are like signals that are coming in from, from Your Eyes, from your ordinance. What if there's a way to get that signal out into the air. So instead of having to be directly input into your brain with, you know, with just a, you know, with site signals and with, you know, the, the, the signals that your ears giving.

Speaker 1:          01:03:27       What if there's a way to tune into the whole mind like a Wifi, but some sort of neural implant or something that activates a certain portion of the brain and literally allows your brain to tune in to everyone else's brain. Like we all like share a giant hard drive, like that totally seems possible. It seems to me like they're just. They just have to figure out how that would work and what kind of a frequency that would operate under, but if they can, they can introduce all sorts of things in the people's brains. This guy, they did an operation on him and they stimulated a part of his brain and he started there were, I forget what they were trying to do. It was this was an accident, but in stimulating part of his brain, he started remembering shit from his childhood, like in graphic detail.

Speaker 1:          01:04:14       It was happening right there, right in front of them. Like they literally figured out how to charge and jumpstart your memories. You know, I think I do shit like that, but they can. They can introduce thoughts to people's minds. They can read vision that can revision now. They can put little things on your head and you look at something and a computer will show an image of what you're looking at. That's incredible. It's not good. It's not good image. They haven't figured it out good yet, but if you read letters, you can see the letter and a picture. Kathy. Not yet. Not yet, but it's close. Well then there'll be able to figure out like memories tariff. Exactly. Close to world. If we've realized that, you know, memories are completely unpredictable. That memories are, they, they're so easy to scramble. You know, when, when you think about like how much of human history was just written down and spoken on memories, memory, arguing with somebody about something. Something happened and they're like, that's not what happened.

Speaker 4:          01:05:18       You know, like, you know what? We're just remembering and I have no idea if I'm the one that's wrong or they are. But it's like, I'd like to say like, no, no, no, you're remembering it wrong, but it's like, why do I think I'm the one you gotta you gotta be real careful

Speaker 1:          01:05:32       that I went back to my home where I grew up in and I hadn't been there in like 10 years ago and I remembered everything different. Man, I'll never forget that my house look different. The fucking street looked different. I thought this. I thought the staircase was on a different side of the street, like I had it all fucked up in my head. That's where I went to the place that I lived at when I was three and an apartment. Then my dad got. My mom was exactly. I was shocked with the numbers go. Different places changed though, you know, knock down a building and changed it around. You don't know. That building was exactly the same. Like how old were you when you got three year olds?

Speaker 4:          01:06:11       Maybe four images from three. That's out of me. But anyway, the street look at the Safeway. Safeway used to be there at this time. You're remembering having, remember remembering the memory about a year ago, and then you remember the year that you remember your memory of the

Speaker 1:          01:06:31       have those individual members for ours. We're thinking about one little thing can throw you off and then it shifts your idea of, oh no, that's not what happened and this happened, and then all of a sudden you see it better, but you were just committed to the way you saw 10 seconds was the incorrect way. It's not fucking reliable enough. That's what I was thinking. What does what I was thinking before about like people like the reason why turtles, turtles live to be 100 years and people will live to be 100 is I don't think you can keep our purpose going and keep us living because the way society seems to work best is if people don't live long enough to figure out that it's all bullshit, you know? Because if they do, then chaos, restructuring, everything goes to a different way and that's not the way that humans are going right now and the way we're going.

Speaker 1:          01:07:18       It's like some sort of a global domination thing, some sort of a technological singularity thing. We're moving further and further and further. If we were able to step back and as a culture get old enough to realize how silly that all is and realized how much better life would be if we all just relaxed and shared resources and be nice to each other and treat the world as if it were friends and work this all out together, but nothing would ever get done. Things get done because people are competing when people competing, people hate the other people. They're competing against, whether it's countries or companies or political parties or anything, so when, when, when that kind of shit happens, that competition is why we made newer and better things. If there was no competition like that, it wouldn't be the pressure to be the best at everything.

Speaker 1:          01:08:01       If you didn't hate the other people, there wouldn't be this pressure to dominate them and crush them, but can live in a world like the Amazon Indians can the whole world. Well, there's some reason why those dudes are still running around with fucking pieces of animal flesh. Covering Dick is don't know if it's wrong. I mean, that's right. Maybe it is. It's certainly an alternative, but I think. I think we have to look at human nature as being natural and I think that if we look at everything else being natural, we look at the way you behave and the way you know a monkey's behave. We look at their simple lives as being natural. While we look at the course of humanity is being natural, we're. We're pretending that it's something that we all consciously control, but if we do, why is it so fucked up?

Speaker 1:          01:08:42       Still? Why is there's so much political corruption when we know there's so much political corruption, why are we still going to war? What we know? We know that wars are ridiculous and that their only ways for profit. Why do you keep continuing along the same lines? Even though rationally we must know a certain point in time, this is an insane way to live. Well, maybe it's because that's just the way people live. I believe we're moving towards with that, that this behavior pushes us toward something. It pushes us towards creation of something global practice. Something, some, some end of wrong little worlds thinking, you know, it's all about us, but meanwhile, you know, whatever's going on, you're just like an end. You're just producing an editor. Zinc that's needs to collectively do something world or something. But we got our labs and it goes to what would our was Ari was saying about the parent's side, like think about that. Think about the animal that this parasite, the parasite lives and has no fucking idea. You know, they have no idea where to distance at all. That has no idea that cat has no idea what it is. I mean, the whole thing is bananas. It's finance. It's all interconnected.

Speaker 6:          01:09:54       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:09:55       Is it as possible? So make those crazy cat ladies too. Is it a few people aren't immune to the fucking Paris. I don't know why there is a certain cap parasite that is infected. A tremendous amount of the female population in Brazil and a bunch of a bunch of other countries. And this is um, a, uh, actual parasite that makes women more docile.

Speaker 6:          01:10:19       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:10:20       Probably the same thing. It was a no fear. I have to look that up because I remember that. It, it, it does sound like that shit. I know why women in Brazil. I have to find this. I have to Google this right now. This, this is too, too strange. I have to find this out because I can't remember what it was when I read it.

Speaker 1:          01:10:50       Parasite in Brazil. Cats, women. I got to find this fucking article, mood altering cat parasites make women friendly and manage the jerks. Dude, that's Brazil jerks. I mean, think about how many, uh, how many, uh, really friendly girls come from Brazil. And how many super aggressive dudes. That's hilarious. Yeah. If you look up what Google would, I looked up, um, you, uh, you come up with a quite a few articles about it. It's a parasite that causes rats to sacrifice himself to cats. May also change human behavior, making women more outgoing and warm hearted and men more jealous and suspicious. The toxo plasma protest is a shed, a shed and cat feces which are then eaten by rats, infected rasp become fearless and the presence of cats, which makes them easier to catch, which in turn spreads the disease to new cats. Holy Shit. It makes women nicer and it makes them Douche bags.

Speaker 1:          01:11:50       That's hilarious. Nature is totally rooting against us. Finding new ways to keep a fucked up. How crazy is that, man? How crazy is that? Because men who are more douchey are more likely to fuck a bunch of different women and and impregnate them like fuck they're friends women and you know, you know what I'm saying? Like the more Douchey guy guidance, the more he's got to do like creepy shit. Go get laid. So the more likely that's gonna make like excellence. Some babies all over the place, it's going to keep spreading the eye. Maybe a nature likes Douche bags. Well it's like it goes back to what I said, it's like, it's almost like you don't really achieve unless there's competition and competition doesn't really mean anything unless it's competition. Like, like primal, you know, a man who hate to you hate him and he hates you and it really forces you to work hard.

Speaker 1:          01:12:40       You know? That's why companies fucking hate each other. Companies that compete against each other or rarely friendly, they fucking hate each other. Maybe they're supposed to. Maybe that's the most efficient way to get things done. You have to light a fire under someone's ass in order to get the most productivity out of them. Hey equals productivity. It's like your life would certainly be better off if you didn't have that, that, that, you know, that aspect too, but you wouldn't be a successful aspect to you though. So, uh, so it's like a fucked up shit like war, you know, that's how it's supposed to happen. That's a, that's a terrible conclusion to terrible conclusion. But it might be that everything we do is the way we're supposed to do it. They have a jealous for war. It's not, I want to do it, but someone's gonna do it, you know, it's just the way they've been doing business forever.

Speaker 1:          01:13:33       It's going to take way too long for that to settle down all these people that promise that they're not going to have war anymore. But I've looked at Obama, he promised that he was going to stop all this. Who's going to pull people out and just more in the never George Bush playing golf, you know, Obama's or play more golf. And George Bush has, I think it's the first term, first year he played 33 times. I said, George, I think a lot of flack for 20th times. Obama's a very smart guy, very good speaker. That's really all I all I have to say. Other than that, I'm not

Speaker 4:          01:14:12       seeing anything different. She stopped doing the things he said he would do. You know, I don't know about the stimulus package. I don't know what's going really happen with that or whether that's because that's too fucking complicated and no one bothered. Nah, fuck it. Well,

Speaker 1:          01:14:32       maybe documentary. My problem. My problem with all this stuff is where, where do I put my attention? How much time do I have in a day? What do I want to think about? Do I want to concentrate on? Oh, how are they fucking us? Oh wait, where's this more? It was more corruption. Come in. What is this? Do I really want to focus on that? Focus on the fucking November ballot. They legalized pot completely.

Speaker 4:          01:14:53       That would be insane. Is that valid ren? Eddie and myself are medical patients. We are a California. Yeah, we're all sick. I, uh, I, uh, I've gotten injured up two surgeries. It's all real and it's a nice calming agent for you, like during the day. It's a perspective of answer, right? I just do it for the insomnia.

Speaker 1:          01:15:25       I say I don't smoke pot all the time. I just smoked before. I have sex before I do comedy. Before. Why comedy for Jujitsu before I know I'm going to eat something delicious. So it's not all the time. It's just before cool shit to make it. I almost feel like that whenever I'm like, Oh, let me make this better and then I'll get the burrito the first time that he got up to me. Hi can we went and got an ice cream Sundae?

Speaker 4:          01:15:50       Uh, so went on stage that night. And you were talking about how great that ice cream Sundae wise was the greatest thing ever. You've wrote material about how good it tastes so good. Right in, right away. The material made more sense. Like I could write material right there. By the first time I got home, by the way, the iron sheik smoke weed only during his big fights before all hulk Hogan fights. That's so crazy. That's. He said he likes it. He likes smoking weed after he trains at after he wrestles, unless it's a big macs and bob back when all the whole Hogan. He was always high during.

Speaker 4:          01:16:35       He knows a lot about what he knows his shit. He knows a lot of other shit too. But the sheet is upon it. And I got, I got a fucking 45 minutes worth of interview with them. I might start posting these. Right. You weren't there when I tell the story and I said I, I walked in towards the end of it, uh, my buddy Danny calls me up and goes, dude, I'm gonna fucking meet Ian Cheek right now. How the fuck did that happen? Because he's in town for like the calm, calm or what a comic, whatever, like a comic book convention. He goes and I twittered as manager and I asked his manager that he could have, if I gave them 200 bucks if we could do the answering machine. You wanted to make one, like the one joe he has for me. He loves it.

Speaker 4:          01:17:18       You want to have a to do his. So the manager, you know, they need money, the magicals come on down or you know, we're at this hotel and I go, oh shit, he goes, you want to roll? I go fuck out. So he jumped in, went to the hotel, but there were waiting outside and like Danny was fuck, it looks like they're in a big hurry because he was texting him, hurry up or you guys that we got to go to the airport, this clock, I want you to give them 200 bucks to sit and rap with them. We get a lot of shit, you know, so um, so fuck it, whatever. So let's do it really quick. So he pulls into this hotel. I don't like rude. He's like, oh, we gotta go to the airport and just make this quick. It's like this quick like, Oh man, okay. Whatever it is, unless you want to take her to the airport, we're driving to the airport. And you were like, yeah, yeah. That way we get them for fucking 40 minutes man. So he got the car video do, we had this fun little restaurant. Usually it's like 45 minutes of six. Just take the whole 45 minutes. Let's put online in one chunk. Yeah, definitely a documentary.

Speaker 4:          01:18:21       There's certain pieces that need to be to make them funnier because we. We didn't rely on it because he gets paid. He's like a like a super villain, almost 70 and you just say, okay. Say and his managers, his nephew, let's say he barely speaks English, is English in 10th grade and was in like a gang. He knows all these west West westworld and fuck him. And then his manager goes, yeah, a Britain down, set them up and then take them home and it's like these code words. It's on the or the video, I forget what it is, slam and take them home and then glaze them at the end or some weird lingo. So then he goes, oh hey, don't really fucked up. Fucked up out of some big moves. Fuck, I love this shit called capital club. So he was made. He was just say all these names. They want to cut them off and like send these guys the messages like, Hey, here's what I heard. Talking mad shit. It's always fuck you in the ass.

Speaker 4:          01:19:22       He just, it's like he's got his, his light. I give me some money. I'll say, who do you want me to say? It's like, what is this personality like outside of that? I'm like a nice guy, but he's not so he's not like that, man. You gotta see you gotTa. See the clip? I will put it online. That's hilarious man. That's one of those dudes that I would love to meet and I was like, Holy Shit, I'm here talking to Hulk Hogan. When I had to do an interview with him and his brother, you don't get fired up. And I'm like, fuck it dude. She was probably all time number one villain ever bigger than I. She, she wasn't really a villain.

Speaker 4:          01:20:17       Villain has sometimes she was fucking evil. He was Iranian nuclear war tax shit. That was deep. That was another bit crazier. Bill and anytime I can barely walk neglectable it got really badly hurt from wrestling. Fucked chester. They take the snake Roberts, he said, I want to get dirt talking about whole Hogan. He's, Oh man, he's up. He's a man. Those kinds of to get operated on, so such a tough life to do that. Every night what they're doing is nutty shit, man. Flying out of turn, but he shot and he talks about. He just does. What is it?

Speaker 4:          01:21:15       He knows this guy who said things that weren't very nice, but anyhow. What is it in her purse or teeth in the morning? No, like his. He started to interview like they asked him, some guys interviewing him and then he's says Jujitsu legend and some guy's interviewing them and says the video starts on Eddie Bravo section and draco Leno on the Geek on world champions wheat on training and then they got the Eddie Robinson champion. Jeff. I guess that's what I always heard about him. I always knew about him. I never knew what he looked like until I saw the video. I never, I would've never, but especially one of the very highly regarded one of the best guys. That Baja racing, older guy now products. That would be something, and the video starts off by who knows, what about, what do you think of Eddie Bravo and then it was dr you're talking about Eddie Bravo, Johnny glow, like he's just like, oh yeah, you really thought he said Johnny Bravo.

Speaker 4:          01:22:19       Like, like that's even funny, you know? And then immediately it starts off with just a bunch of backhanded compliments. Like, like, uh, oh yeah, he's got some good positions, but you know, me and already had a high guard. Like he was like basically saying that Nino had my style of guard first when me and Nina filed. Guards are totally different. They're nothing there. Nothing there. You're very difficult to often. I mean we both play, you know, we do own a blocks and stuff and I got the job a blocker for him, but the actual style of our guards are very different. And uh, obviously he doesn't know that, you know, he doesn't, he hasn't really paid attention but enough to know the difference. Big fucking difference. Um, and then it says other stuff like, uh,

Speaker 5:          01:23:07       it's just a bunch of backhanded compliments. It wasn't very, but I thought it was hilarious.

Speaker 1:          01:23:12       And so, uh, so she knew about that. Huh? So the sheep knew about that? Oh, I don't know. I don't know. He said a lot of good things about me. Thanks man. Shit about me.

Speaker 5:          01:23:24       Yeah, he likes me. I really can't say anything bad about the recording. I mean, I don't even fucking know.

Speaker 1:          01:23:31       Well, you know what, man, I think, uh, there's a lot of people that don't know you and you have a polarizing effect because you're so controversial because, uh, just the way you look, the way you act, you know, your behavior is very controversial. You know, what you think about, like most Jujitsu people, Jujitsu instructors, they're not like wild musician motherfuckers, you know that or come up with Jujitsu moves because they're high on weed like that. That fucks up with their whole dynamic. Their whole view of what you know Jitsu is. And so if they, because a lot of dudes don't know you, I think that's where the controversy comes in, but they got to know. You then realize that you're just sort of completely openminded dude who's willing to accept techniques from anywhere and gives people credit all the time and you invent moves or you teach moves based on people's names, you know, like the doodle or did you know different types of needs that you've got the Jacques sweep that you got from each individual.

Speaker 1:          01:24:28       You give them all credit. They just don't. They don't know. They, they see you getting all this credit for this revolution, revolutionary type of guard and so they just assumed that it's all bullshit. It's all over hyped, but really it's not. It's not on time. Do you got some weird wild shit. You put it together in like a real system, you know, and it's. And it's very legit and it's very unusual and you're willing to talk to anybody and have them fuck with it and come up with their own stuff. When you look at all the different things that you've added from your students, look at all the moves for Edwin stuff. You know all, you know how you started incorporating that in a class. You know, all sorts of different shifts. The Japanese in that time, so you're always, you know, adding whenever there's a new thing, you're always adding it and always giving the person credit created who created.

Speaker 5:          01:25:11       That's one thing. That's probably the one thing that, that uh, the biggest misconception is that you take credit for things. Yeah. Is it? I take moves and I changed the names and then I pretend like I made them up and I put a whole new name. Like there's a lot of people out there that think back and that's kind of true or not really sort of 50. It's totally the opposite. It's the opposite. I everybody fucking up.

Speaker 1:          01:25:41       Well, like the twister, you know, when you first started doing the twister and inside wrestling with.

Speaker 5:          01:25:45       Yeah, that's a big. That was the big thing because I never called it the twister I got. It was the of is guilty to me, but the guillotines and John Job, it was, the good team was already taken and Jujitsu and submission, grappling, all that shit. So when I would call the good see now in Brazil and just called it the twister and stuck after a. So a lot of people

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       think like, Russell's Goldman did that in high school, man. I'm like, yeah, you got to know the story. So real quick, it's easy to convince those guys if they ask about me like, what's up with this twitter thing? Uh, you know, that's a guillotine. And wrestling they go, yeah, yeah, he's got a bunch of groups like that dude. He just changes names and then real quick now I got to dig myself out of a deep hole with a lot of people like that. That's like a total opposite misconception that I like take moons and steal them. And, and that's, I like, I did it for awhile and then I had to stop and slow down and change my ways. And from day one, my first book I give everyone credit my Silverado do all that shit. I've, I get pissed off when people learn techniques from someone else and I know them personally. I know where they got the move from and then they start showing it to someone and that'll bring up the person that taught them. That offends me. I don't always remember to bring up names, but I tried to as much as I can.

Speaker 1:          01:27:01       Jujitsu moves as like a creative thing that you're adding to like one big gigantic piece of artwork, like the martial art itself, like when you, when you invented a new technique, like you invent some new sweep or some new way to set up a Google plateau and then you add it to the Jujitsu language. Do you feel like that's what it is? It's almost like you feel like it's like a piece of art, so it was something that you create and people don't give you credit for creating that and then people were out there doing it. It's like they're stealing your art almost because they're going to do it regardless what they want. So that's the thing. Anybody who was doing his shit, he supports and he even had a cop, you know, like you, you'd love that guy out there doing your shit.

Speaker 4:          01:27:39       Yeah, totally. I mean I'm human. I want, you know, if someone learns some ship directly from me or my books or anything, you know, the right thing to do is get credit, you know, that's the right thing to do and not giving credit is you did it, you know, whoever you learn a technique from the crowd, you've got to, if you don't go into a strap on, it doesn't take away from what you did at all. You know, people think that somehow or another you teach them a guy, you know, a certain way to set up a rear naked and then he does it and then you give them credit. It takes away from him. No, it doesn't take away from that at all. Not at all. It's just the friendly thing to do. And he sounded like daytime, like I pull off a submission, a that someone else in class showed me.

Speaker 4:          01:28:22       I'll always go from go it, got it twice a day, you know what I mean? Do the same thing or the same thing. Yeah, that's important man. It's, it's important and it's, it, uh, fosters that friendly attitude to come out. All I'm trying to do, I mean I guess it feels good. It's like a piece of art and something. I always feel good when a new transition comes up out of nowhere or someone else and one of my students to me or we see it on the Internet. I get excited. It's cool. It's like another. Those beans I'll do

Speaker 1:          01:28:49       it. Have no idea how complex it is. They really have no idea how many levels and layers there say like I was talking to Nathan, we were talking about, hey, he trained with Marcello and I went down to New York of training them a couple of times and it was just talking about how good marcella moves and how it's really amazing to see someone operate on that level and we just started thinking about it, like how humbling that is. Like when you're around a guy like Marcello or operator or something like that. Video. Wait Online, rolling through. People just rolling through one after another. Just submitting a left, right, left, right, left, right. When, when you see someone who's at that high level, you know, it's like, it's so humbling because you realize how many gundam layers there are to this. It never ends. It's a more complex and more, you know, the guy shoots a pet, gets faster and they're diving on shit with more precision and their technique is more crisp and more sharp and more options and

Speaker 5:          01:29:41       there's 12 different ways that I can count and they're maybe more 12 to toys to play off your back. Then that's what I can count. Well distinctly different styles. Like there's a difference you can tell to the train die. So look at Tom. He's playing deep path. He's ex card, he's playing a lockdown. Hap, he's playing 50 slash 50 guard. He's planning a butterfly gardens and Robert Gard, there's 12 of them that I could count. There might be more of a Deli, Heba Guard, spiral card, all that shit. There's so many. It's so complex. I mean, I've been doing Jujitsu for 16 years. I suck at most of those gardens. Like I'm not that good at. I might have been della Heba Guard doesn't exist there, so that's a whole different stock spiral guard, inverted guard. I never do any of that stuff. I never played 50 slash 50 guard.

Speaker 5:          01:30:37       I never did any of that shit. I mean I have like four or five guards and there's like 12. There's a lot of them that I don't do. There's so much like all these world champions like Rafael Mendez and marina and all these guys. This is totally different than mine. Totally. Like if we've taught for our seminars eats, I mean two different worlds, you know what I mean? There's so much to learn which path you're going to take. You know what I mean? I've been doing like again 16 years and I'm still putting new weapons into the game. That's. I make sure that there's always new projects that are always, always, always got to be a new projects and those projects could take one to three years to get where you need them to be. The Doris is still my project from like, you know, five years ago, you know, I'm not as good as the top guys with.

Speaker 5:          01:31:24       Does a pretty good and I'm not, I'm not as good as, I still got some more levels to pop through, but you know the over the last year, year and a half via teens and north south suck with those, but they've been on my project. That's when I go against the scrubs. When I go against the white belts and new guys, you know, I'm not going to do anything that I'm good. I'm going to only get shit that I suck at and try to train my body. I would get into north south and I go, this feels awkward. I don't know how Danny does it, you know, and, but I would get in there and try to get as far as I can and I'd lose it. I'd go do something else. That's cool. I'll come back to it and try it again. We're not stopping. I'm not really pleasing.

Speaker 5:          01:32:00       Right. Trying to move my lucky focus on it and after awhile then you get into like, oh, okay, this is feeling good. I think, you know, eventually it'll come and you have to remember that people forget that because a lot of people when they try something new they go, well, it feels kind of awkward. Fuck that. I'm gonna. Go back to my shit. I don't know. He's weird. He's got some strange too big. You got to remember that all moves. Feel awkward in the beginning and if you want this movement, doesn't matter. You can master listening if you want it, you can be a carrier with this. It's up to you how many reps who are willing to put in, you know, and in Jujitsu, you know, the only sport where you can spar 100 percent every day. Everyone just sparse there. Like maybe they'd put in as few reps as possible.

Speaker 5:          01:32:42       Most people have that mentality back unless you force them. And that's what I do. I force my guys because I know they're going to get lazy and a guy said, okay, everyone do 15 those, 20 of that and make sure to do that. And like I write it on a board and I just kicked back and you know, chill. They're not going to do it. You gotta have people need people. That's why they hire trainers. They can do everything. They know all the exercises. They know they can be. They just need some of the foursome and got someone to force you and you're paying them. Then it's easier to go to that shit.

Speaker 1:          01:33:11       Never do to actually get to try it.

Speaker 5:          01:33:16       For me, I just look at everything. Most things because like longterm projects, like what? How many cycles have you gone through with this technique and eventually by third or fourth cycle, once you hit it bad left, now he's doing really well and look at them.

Speaker 1:          01:33:29       Yeah. It's hard to motivate yourself to push yourself. It is definitely important. And pushing. Rolling. Uh, so much more fun.

Speaker 5:          01:33:36       Drills. Yeah. Actually. Can you imagine getting on a video game and do you ever get on the practice? Just practice the little movements over and over, like 50 times. Like, okay this. Do people do that? Like a room where they can just practice movements and now they're getting really good with all the moves and they do all the techniques

Speaker 1:          01:33:56       that it's like a workout they do. Wake up is based on map. It's based on map systems. So there's a bunch of different maps to play on. But one of the most important things about playing quick when you're in a one on one tool is to understand the map. You're got to know where the guns are out there hitting. You got to know where you're going to control the map. So what you've gotta do is you've gotta make sure you're not every fucking, every minute area and you can move around. So they practice their practice like special jumps and rocket jobs. Practice jumping into certain areas and so they don't get to have a really far and then crumble. So they'll practice that shape their practices so they have complete command of the map so they can move around the map anywhere they want. And then they practice timing. When the, uh, the new version, because you were playing the best person though is quite free to me. Quite force, pretty bad ass. That's the latest I think, quick for us to last because it takes years to make, you know, everyone they didn't know. They came up with a new tool every year when they get better and better. I know. Anything about video games

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       does this, like the graphics and the amount of area you can travel to always bigger getting bigger and bigger.

Speaker 1:          01:35:09       Massive with orange juice or something like that. Role player games, massive world. It's like an artificial world again where you can just travel for miles and meet new people and show people, live their whole lives inside those things

Speaker 2:          01:35:23       and they're actually real people and they're the real people. Real people playing. The people have lost their mind when it comes to these things. I never even heard of that. People Starve people. There's two people in Korea but their baby starve

Speaker 1:          01:35:38       while they are nourishing their online. Maybe they have fake baby online and they were taking care of that baby while they're real baby starve to death. And Dean Boston marbles. That's crazy. People are living in artificial worlds eight, 10 hours a day and addicted to it. What's it called? There's a bunch of world of warcraft. There's a, there's a everquest. There's a. what's the other one? The sims. There's um, uh, there's another one. Something line. There's no, no, no. That's the, that's the cool with the advantage. So efficient one. How many people on second life maybe was called second life for a second. Do there's 13,000. Two hundred and 10 people. No, no, no. Look above.

Speaker 2:          01:36:28       People are dropping off. They're like, what the fuck am I watching? Watching three retards stoned out of their minds. And I've talk to a camera. Thirty thousand, 200, 10. All this shit isn't boring.

Speaker 1:          01:36:44       It's the 4:20 episode. If they're all with us or with us.

Speaker 2:          01:36:49       I passed out on park today. Well, I've been close like two or three times a month or two in a real life is like, oh my God. And then I imagine that jumps in the bed. I think on the floor. The top of my head. How much weed? Not that much,

Speaker 1:          01:37:03       dude. Not that much and it happened to his girlfriend I had once and it was like she had like one kid. It wasn't anything major. Just what I saw someone do that we gave the. That chick was working on fear factor and that was one of the production people. We're all, we're all in New York or outside of. We all went out there filming there for the weekend instead of Bar, have a drink, get as much smoke, someone to never smoked to joining the ship. One big hips train wreck and her eyes rolled back in her head and she was dropped. I thought she was faking,

Speaker 2:          01:37:39       pretending like I was part, so I'm so I'm going to pass out. I thought she, she's being silly, like we got to catch her up as she was falling down to the ground. The girlfriend was like that and I was like, what are you doing? And I understand that she was going down.

Speaker 1:          01:37:53       Did you catch him? Nope. Did you make

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       an effort, an effort scheduled popcorn so that the fucking check drop. So you didn't have to drop your popcorn and probably wasn't gonna be able to catch her anyway. What you need to get a chance. I didn't understand what was really happening, but it happened to me yesterday. How many, how long have you been? Data's checked a few months. Oh, attached were you to her. Right. So we bummed out when she bumped her out, she felt. Yeah, I didn't quite get it until she was fully down and paint. Because you feel about responsible. Somebody else. It gave us Wednesday. Zombieland did you watch this season of celebrity rehab? I watched one episode that check from one day at a time. Mackenzie Phillips rooming with this country x country center. You as epileptic seizures and she would always like in the middle of this conversation she was just telling Mckenzie

Speaker 4:          01:39:03       she's breaking breezy. It's not required that mother Charles after the commercial.

Speaker 2:          01:39:21       Oh my God. Have you guys seen shreds? Shreds shreds is a thing you guys are doing. They're taking music videos and redoing the music like I just saw from Germany. They redo the music set as lipstick and totally as perfect as possible. But the worst voices,

Speaker 4:          01:39:42       everything's attitude and everything inside the cabinet. So you see this. It's like the worst brought.

Speaker 2:          01:39:50       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:39:51       Jerry, like they suck.

Speaker 2:          01:40:03       Let's watch it and we'll. Anyway. You want to journey. It's funny. They did one on Mac dance, a dance at the center and he's friends with this guy now and he said when he showed it to him too, he got really offended at the journeys and journeys. I, you know, they're like amazing musicians and singers. Okay. I looked up shreds. Journey treads, wet shreds. Journey. That's it. Any way you want to eat or ed. I think if we're going to be within the journey, just a junky shreds. That's it. That's it. That's at the top. And you make it to the audience. Watch junkie shred. You guys going to have to look up junkie shreds

Speaker 4:          01:40:53       junkie.

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       Jerk knee. Jerk jerk commercial journey. Like journey. Oh, journey down. I didn't get it either. Sure. It's genius. That's very funny. That's good. Shit. You guys to watch it. I just sent it to a twitter already. Can do that. So easy. It's so easy to do stuff like that. Now to edit video and put it online, like it'd be nice to be hard to actually listen to the song on earphones record here. Right along with them as they're doing it. Yeah. What'd you can do now? A lot of people have already seen it. Go look up van Halen

Speaker 6:          01:43:17       or, or, um, different. Different.

Speaker 2:          01:43:23       That was some funny shit. Yeah. It was funny. I try to read some of those. We might be too high and we're doing this. Should, should be illegal. Ari, that bladder?

Speaker 6:          01:43:42       No,

Speaker 2:          01:43:44       that was loud. Yeah, sorry. Well that recovered it and they do that the best way. Kids threads. I heard you were publishing it.

Speaker 1:          01:43:54       Scientific paper in neuroscience. That's hilarious. If that wasn't true, I would be a Carlson. Been seeing it.

Speaker 2:          01:44:04       Somebody wrote some shit in the Arabic. Arabic does the cool. Doesn't it look cool? That shit looks Arabic. Yeah. That's probably the coolest second. Writing on the plan. Probably Cooler than Chinese or Japanese. It looks like something elegant to it, you know, it's like cool to see it on your wall. You know, it was like art.

Speaker 1:          01:44:34       So this chick wants to fuck you. Do SLURP, Bella? She's back. Oh Shit. She says,

Speaker 2:          01:44:40       explain the name name's Bella. Where'd you get that from? Who gave it to you? Did you doubt yourself?

Speaker 1:          01:44:46       People in here, man. There's no way are we gonna have to keep an eye on it to catch her response. Can I get Dave Chappelle on here sometime? I would love to hang out with Dave Chappelle, but I don't know him that well. We did a show a couple of times and one time it's just because I was walking on the street and random and other times the fear factor one, the one we ran into was hilarious. Remember that you would have been in New York. We're just walking on the street and I'm like, oh, like dish called a mustache on things like, hey joe, you want to be in my show? Was like,

Speaker 2:          01:45:17       okay, and was that a nowhere? No, it's Times Square. Just walking down the street. That was what a Dave Chappelle show, you know, like nobody had any idea it was even coming out. And then when it came out like right away. Well that was the best show ever. But the first case, I'm sure it was like, no, no, no, let's leave it. That one knocked it out of the park. That was the best shot with that. The first sketch ever. And so I don't know. I know it's the first sketch on the top 25 because I think when he said it, I think I remember it going like we lose my friends said I shouldn't do this. It almost seemed like he had introduced to other scriptures already, but just for the audience knows the answer to this. But that's a good question. That seems like intelligence. The audience here. We could find out anything about that.

Speaker 1:          01:46:00       How about when we couldn't remember that dude's name earlier? Dennis hopper just knocked up. Yeah. That's incredible. Yeah, I mean there's, there's a 1600, 66. One, six, six, six. We're evil. We're officially

Speaker 2:          01:46:16       do got a lot of viewers.

Speaker 1:          01:46:20       Right. And some other shiny happy Jihad. Listen man, don't be mixing my shit up with that shit because I don't know what you're saying about the chicken, Nevada that got sent to life in prison because she talked to 14 year old boy. Just wanting to try to get them to have sex with her and she grabbed his hand and put it on her tit and try to get an a fucker. Got Life in prison. That is the mandatory sentence for that life and business and management. She's 14, the kids 14 years old and she's like 34 some shit and she grabbed the kid's hand and put it on her tick and she said she was drunk and she doesn't remember any of it and this bitch is going to.

Speaker 2:          01:46:59       Oh, that's possible. Don't remember who did it. All she did was put it, you know, obviously the bitches crazy and she needs to do like a, a night in jail or maybe a week at the most, you know, like what would it be like to spend one month in prison that will fucking destroy a lot of your life. Yeah. And people are like, oh. And he's got at least 10 years. Thinking about what a month, year in prison would be horrifying. Terrible, terrible. And for just getting a boy to touch at 10, I mean, yeah you should have done it, but come on, you're supposed to like slap on the wrist. Tony Kanal there so that. So she's not even eligible for parole for 10 years. She has to go 10 years before she was even eligible. I'd like to know the details of that shit not been done.

Speaker 1:          01:47:53       You guys just fucking support held area

Speaker 2:          01:47:56       and I'm going to send an unbelievable. It's hard to believe that people are that stupid. I would give someone like her that. I mean that's why it's an interesting story. So when you're in class got thrown out and you do like nothing or school but share and it's like, no you didn't, you were moving over and told you to stop. That's all well and good. But that was the charges with the charges were,

Speaker 1:          01:48:17       is um, lewdness minor or some shit like that.

Speaker 2:          01:48:21       She's machines for awhile. Probably wasn't the first time raising feed stocks deck on the little kids. Doesn't stop. Well, if she did it to this kitchen,

Speaker 1:          01:48:34       probably done the other one. It's not like she's been fucking grown men, it's just that they're just take time. It's not like, you know, like all of a sudden out of nowhere she says, let me just dive in this 14 year old thing. She's done it before, so it's just not particular about who she blows, you know, that's all that is. She's just a crazy bitch, but she didn't have to go to jail for the rest of her fucking life. That's not know. They're trying to put kids in Jennifer's sexting and trying to make it illegal for girls to share their same child pornographer not notes of course. Right.

Speaker 2:          01:49:11       Do what are they doing it to each other and childhood setting through their boyfriends.

Speaker 1:          01:49:16       One of your questions store a bunch of spend it. I think it was like nine girls got suspended from school because they had a bunch of pictures that they took and put on their myspace page in between school when they're not at school, like during the summer break. So when it came back to school, there was suspended because of sexy pictures of them. I suppose they're like sucking fingers sticking out and underwear and stuff and there were like 14. They're just doing a normal horse shit and they got suspended. So the girls are suing the school. They're going to win. I mean if it can go on my space, you can't tell someone they can't do something during their off time because you're not like it, but you're just because you're teaching them, you know, when did the these fucking retards,

Speaker 2:          01:49:59       whatsapp people access and go to school. What you could access.

Speaker 1:          01:50:04       That's cool. If you had access to my space at school, I don't know what kind of Internet access to have at school. Yeah, but either way the kids should be able to put. Everyone wants to be a war so it'd be a more. You can't legislate against that and you certainly can't punish them for shit to do. You're acting like you're in fucking mom. Like you're. You're saying you don't want them in school because of what they're going to. It's going to give other people a bad impression of your school. Is that what it is? Because she's in her underwear online. Like shut the fuck up. So this is one of these dummies because that are, that are teaching our kids today and that's the problem. There's a bunch of. Were fucking audience, you know. When did they become the parents? When did they become the, you know, the moral arbitrators and what, when did they become the people that dictate now how people are supposed to behave. You know, if you don't have a problem with your kid sticking her ass up in the air and space and you're the teacher, you should be like, whatever. I'm going to teach you some science and you get through life and enjoy yourself, but with the teachers will step in and say you shouldn't be in your underwear when you're mad at school. Like fuck you. Who Do you just teach? Just teach me. You don't, you don't get to fucking shut my life down because you know you don't like me in my underwear.

Speaker 2:          01:51:10       Seattle. I said that. I said in the first person I got was a 14 year old girl, was a secret fantasy. He didn't even notice that. How did they? 14, 14, 14, 15 years old.

Speaker 1:          01:51:27       Do you can't stop checks from doing worship? They arrested a 15 year old girlfriend child. I'm free because she sent a dude a in her class,

Speaker 2:          01:51:33       a picture of repurposing, so they arrested her. They eventually charged her with a use of criminal tools in a criminal tool. Was a cell phone, wasn't charged the community. Is that. That's incredible. That's a tiny little facts. Izzy. Yeah, Brian's fucked. I love you. I'm also invited. Oh, that's so sweet for Brian Wilson here. Have done. Brian is Brian Bent into a school and he was eating some yogurt and bit down first of all, signed. And that's supposed to bite that God damn hard on yogurt. You Know How hungry is he? Bit Down into his metal spoon. Yeah. What are you doing? Biting it. I don't need to go over all the plastics bullets from now and for you. So he bit down on us. Go and focus to waste. I am. Scott said he's going to put them in a triangle choke. How dare you? I don't like being caught trying. That's uncomfortable. Scared. Scared that you're scared. Now you really got me scared. I'll just say he was stoned, eating yogurt, yogurt, thinking about yummy ticks.

Speaker 1:          01:52:46       Just get outside of the clamp down. I'm thankful. We talked about all the things I wanted to talk about. I talked about the lady in Nevada. We talked about strikeforce and they have any other comments? Eddie? Mike Whitehead got busted for sexual assaults. That's not good for the movement. My Damn, that sucks. I was he drunk too. I hope it's all bullshit. Jack Jack Hair Dye and you know, he had a massive heart attack a year ago and is based on. So they just thought she was dead the whole time. I didn't know who was a person they thought he was done. There was a bunch of people sat like, I think even doug sent out an RFP with a lot of people were saying he was dead and so there the rumor going around but it wasn't. He was dead, but he was basically like barely. It is basically the.

Speaker 1:          01:53:36       Wow. I don't know the scientists of the medical details, but I know that he was in really, really bad shape from the time of that till till now. So who was it, sorry, it wasn't that he was just really a powerful marijuana activists that started out his life as like this gold water republican type guy who was like really anti elite and then he'd gotten divorced and smoking pot with this woman that he had just met this new woman. He took a chance and there's a single guy and you know, hanging out with some chicken and really kind of was blown away by it and then know, fell in love with the effects of marijuana and instead of looking into the history and then he put up this really fucking amazing book called the emperor wears no clothes and it's all about this marijuana already been general. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          01:54:22       putting him in jail. The reason he went to jail because he, before he wrote the book, he was already at like a marijuana activist for certain things. There's so many ways you could fight for marijuana, but I forget exactly what he was fighting for. In the very beginning. He was protesting in front of a federal building. Reagan showed up. Reagan a total people that federal building have handled. You had the cops come and arrest everybody. All they had to do was pay like $20 a ticket or something. He refused the pad and he went to jail for a year. Yeah, he went to jail. That's where it was. Good for him. He, that's where you had the time to write. The emperor wears no clothes.

Speaker 1:          01:55:01       Jaylen. That's amazing. Yeah, it's amazing. It's a good book too. It's really very detailed. If you want to know anything about the history of propaganda and the hemp being made illegal, everybody thinks that the reason why marijuana is illegal because it's bad for you. I mean if you ask 100 people $75, we got to tell you it's bad for you. It's something that doesn't bring it down, which causes some problems, but that's not why it's illegal. It's illegal because when they figured out a way to process him, fibers more effectively. That came up. This thing called the decorticator. There's a machine that grinds up to happen and them with the fibers easier to process. William Randolph hearst owned the paper companies and he also owned newspapers. So these paper companies, you know, they make paper out of a fucking and this tap won't paper was much better as far superior and it was a competing product so he wanted to make an illegal.

Speaker 1:          01:55:49       So when he decided to do was print newspaper articles where they said that blacks and Mexicans were raping white women. I knew it and the reason why they were, they said the reason why they were raping white women, it's because they were smoking this new drug called marijuana. So when Congress made marijuana illegal, they didn't even know they're making the textile, you know, the, the, the fabric, the, you know, all the things that hemp can make. It didn't really even know they were making that illegal to. They have no idea. It's really completely ridiculous. The fact that it's stuck from the 19 thirties all the way to here, 2010, even though we know it's ridiculous. I mean you can go right now what on the corner store and buy Jack Daniels and trick ourselves to death easy. We walked in with there right now, we each bought a big ass bottle, a gallon jug of Jack Daniels. All three of us in life. No one would bat an eye. That's lethal doses we just bought lethal dose is about, and we can just come here and three of us would drink those drip down Jack tennis until her body literally shut the fuck down.

Speaker 1:          01:56:50       That sounds cool. How crazy is it that people don't even bat an eye that marijuana should or shouldn't be illegal? It's, of course it shouldn't be legal. If you can go and buy Jack Daniels.

Speaker 6:          01:57:02       Ridiculous.

Speaker 1:          01:57:06       Ridiculous. I'm fucking hungry. You know what? End this thing. Good. I think we've done enough. I think we've already talked about. So you know,

Speaker 1:          01:57:21       I think they're born enough. Anderson Silva, Sandy's going to take all the UFC belt. You know what? Maybe Anderson Silva's board at 185 pounds. Maybe. That's the reason why his last performance wasn't up to par. You know who the fuck knows man? You don't know until you're inside that dudes had no. He's obviously brilliant. You know, and it's Friday and he's probably a very complicated dude, you know, but I think I would like to see him challenged that Shell fight is gonna be very interesting. Chael Simon's going to talk a lot of shit and he's going to attack it and yeah, August I think it's going to be in Salt Lake City. Well, she also has a real good rest fucking well you should come in, which was really impressive because you should have time start to be like this real powerful grappler. Chilson just manhandled them, grapple the shit out of him. Daddy beat chess. Then it'd be a landmark for now. I'm just like, oh, that really opened a lot of people and so now he gets his way. He took on a really explosive with double leg take downs and you don't see that often. You see that?

Speaker 1:          01:58:23       He does. He's like GSP with wrestling. She fought Demian Maia before that and you've got triangled. You got a got taken down as soon as you hit him with like a lateral or some sort of a thrill. It's really impressive. And Damien mounted them and then stopped the triangle from the mountain and pulls up on top of them and tapped into drag. It's a really sweet is there too, but you know, the Damien minor thing, you know, if that guy catches, catches you, he's really good at that. And she also has been caught in the past. That would be an interesting thing. If Anderson could submit him off of his back, that would be fantastic. Because you know, Chael Sonnen at some point in time, Anderson doesn't lock them out immediately. So someone's going to have Anderson not as back, you know, invested catches them was coming in, which is always possible. But they understand

Speaker 5:          01:59:12       crawling, feeling tight, close. There's going to take a submission to friends in the guard and passing the garden a little more serious. I have a feeling. Yeah, I don't think he's gonna come out because he gets caught off guard because he likes the column in the garland pound in the garden. You can get caught, you know, look at that car and airbnb kind of caught, you know. And he's awesome. He's awesome at Jujitsu, but it wants shale. Finally realizes that it needs to get really good at passing and mounting and taken aback flock once he realizes that he needs to adapt the GSP strategy. Once he looks at GSP fights and says, Holy Shit I should be doing with GSP is doing. Once he makes that decision will be unstoppable. Serious reason why he does great, but then you know he loses, he does great, but he moves his because he is not taking guard, passing and being safe in the garden and taking guard, passing as the number one priority over and power in that and the full guard. The only should really pound in before God to open shit out. Like passing should be your number one focus. Look at GSP passing is this number one focus. That is the correct attitude. That's important.

Speaker 1:          02:00:29       Strategy. Jackson said about GSP. Greg Jackson said the fact that he didn't want to GSP to pass the gardening. We took it down. He said, just don't pass his garbage route.

Speaker 5:          02:00:39       He was. He was being could it

Speaker 1:          02:00:44       saying you couldn't pass his guard, that he wasn't passing it and he was like, I guess we thought he was wasting energy just wanting to feed them up from inside the guard. You know that. Then she goes towards good from the half guard.

Speaker 5:          02:00:58       You didn't get it. I don't agree with that strategy at all ever. I would never do that, but I can understand it in a way where I can see that the after GSP passes guard and Martyrdom Dang hard. It would give this back. Then he would post up and then eventually shake them off and they would stand up again that every time. So you've got. Jackson was looking at it as like it'd be past the guards amount. The NIGGA that mentioned stand up as it gets back up and it gets up. So I think just do it. Just like staying this guard. He can't get up from there. He can't get up from the guard, he can't get up once it gets back, you know. So just standard gardens, get the w don't take a fucking chance on this guy. That's like the

Speaker 2:          02:01:40       super conservative strategy, which I understand, but I think GSP was doing five and I think you should always go for the finish and always go for the past almost twice. He almost had,

Speaker 4:          02:01:53       so yeah, you don't. You don't want to. You don't want your job,

Speaker 2:          02:01:58       and they were working on it afterwards. They're working on tightening. What he was doing wrong with setting up is Kamora telling him to hit it at a different angle. I don't know. I don't remember how he did it. Did you have to leg over the face in San Controller to the other leg over the face? I don't remember what side control, but that gap. The Camorra looks strong. The arm bar looks strong for a couple seconds, man. I'm bobby's been back way back for a couple seconds to Dan Hardee just rented it out. We'll just face the mat. Turned himself over and Dan only had two scratches on his under his right eye and he wasn't hurt as arms refine and some may has amazing that he went five rounds of GSP and he barely had a couple of mics on it. Go back and ask you this man. No parties a tough dude. He's such a smart guy too. So good at shit. Talking so good at those interviews that I have. You know, it's like, it's such a tricky thing because in one way that's like Kinda like anti, like with the martial arts is supposed to stand for talking shit and you know that when dudes do talk shit they make it so much more interesting. Yeah. I think they talk shit back in ancient times. Like Samurais against we dudes and all that. I said I think they touched it.

Speaker 4:          02:03:11       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:03:13       It's a tactic. It fucks with people's heads.

Speaker 4:          02:03:16       Jumped ship.

Speaker 2:          02:03:19       Terrible. My Dick doesn't want to make you something like that. What is it is a tactic, you know, fucking dudes heads. It is like a legitimate technique. The problem is that everyone thinks they're doing so well and I like rarely actually feels people off their games. That was witty issues sometimes to mix it. Douchey. The two guys are just talking shit to each other now sometimes you know, you know, but when guys are good at it, but it wasn't like personal interview. I'm going to be honest with you,

Speaker 4:          02:03:58       I got when I'm going to go out and give it my all, that's all I can do. What else do you want me to do?

Speaker 2:          02:04:08       Here's the deal, man. I don't really have a lot of job options. I need some money, you know, and it's not a lot of money, but fuck it. I need to fight and you know, seeing that it's going to be a sound on tv a couple of times and I thought, you know what? I'm to make some cash with that. My favorite was Anderson and one of the times when they go back and forth, it'll tell you what, that guy said it. You say something and it goes like divorced guy. I said, well, he's fucking drama school. But. So, uh, they said you don't understand. Like I said, he's going to get you down, you know, Algebra submission. It was just like, that's a great tactic. You know what I'm saying?

Speaker 2:          02:04:46       That's the smart way, smart way to tell her that Anderson is pretty good when it comes to cit talking, how casual economy gets, but apparently it gets very angry. I mean, when you saw that Chael Sonnen fight men or the rather Damien Maia fight, he gets real angry, you know Damien Maia, whatever the Fuck David am I said really made him bananas and that second round, I don't know what the fuck was said a lot, but have you ever seen him like that before? Ever? Just screaming, screaming shit, talking like that never would have been. What would happen again in mind when he bought boots and an Anderson Silva's and what a Danny Meyer started doing. Some fucking windmill break would stop. What if it just started to break? That's crazy. It's like right in the middle. You just started break dancing. You know that thing where it's like they don't dress it.

Speaker 2:          02:05:38       They spend. That would be awesome. I could do that. George St Pierre to break dance. You remember? He used to do that a little bit and something's really, really good when you attack someone like that, like he just fucking spun out a big propeller energy. People imagine that's a fucking break. That would be bad ass, man. I bet the break dancers would start making up like this and it was fucking switched positions and they can break down a break dance card to have capital or a gun together with break dancing and it created a new. Marsha said, let's spending like a tsunami of things. Just dive in. You're going to get fucking balls and go right to the headspin when you spend on your head and then slide your legs out. Fucking. Yeah. Yeah, it'd be great. I think that's probably a good board yet we're talking about.

Speaker 2:          02:06:47       Yeah. Let's talk about that real quick while you're here. What did you think about Shinya Aoki? Gilbert Melendez. Very interesting fight. You know, Gilbert Melendez is awesome and the guard and he did a great job at staying away from any danger in it. I think maybe once or twice Aoki at m and ms dot controlling, smashed against the cage. That was a bad mother fucker know Gilbert Times. Awesome. Timing is standing up, was wicked. He stayed on top of him. You know what I mean? The only way that strategy was going to work for him, you know, state avoiding the gardens, if he could beat him in standard exchanges, and it definitely did because he lived in these theaters. Deacon is asked, you know, that that really map the risks, wants enforcement on. That was good.

Speaker 1:          02:07:35       He got, he got the arm trapped a couple times, but typically just right the fuck out of it. And it was never in any danger at all. So that was a big fight for him, don't. He's just not as good with the fucking with regular shorts. So it was Jay shows contract demonstrated for us because it supposedly. Yeah. Which is amazing, but if they really let him fight without a contract saying that if he wins that he's still in contract. I don't know how that stuff works. I didn't know you could do that. I guess you can if you're not willing to sign a new contract against him. So he felt like. I think jake shields was upset because he felt like they were not respected.

Speaker 1:          02:08:16       They didn't promote him enough day. Mostly. Most of the promotion that they had was mentioning Dan Henderson and because he was on his last fight to be a big deal, I mean Dan's a legend from to time pride champion in two different weight classes. So that was a big deal for them. A big acquisition. They thought he was going to be the big star, so they, they were hoping that jake shields would lose, I guess, given the right away the other guy off this first fight, the first fight in the organizations and title fight, you know, on CBS and a crazy ass fucking fight to whoever thought that jake shields bill to take Dan Henderson down that many times. Just order pizza and watch it.

Speaker 1:          02:09:02       All right then. That's it. Ladies and gentlemen, this was the first annual for 20 podcasts. Uh, I think we've got some good shit we talked about in there. I think we lost the train of conversation too much potato chips you're going to have, considering the fact that we got completely vaporized. It was a really, uh, it was, it was not bad. Next week I should have couches in here and it'll be all set up and then the week after that it will be my twitter. Yeah, twitter is Eddie Bravo, twitter APP. Eddie Bravo. Every bottle for Joe Rogan.net. I'm trying to get Joe Rogan. If you got Joe Rogan hollow out and they go, let me know. I like to get that stuff. Thanks guys. Later.

Speaker 6:          02:09:57       You ever broke one of his bags?

Speaker 1:          02:10:14       Firefox is frozen again. This is the second time that I've shut this off and so everybody can still hear me right now. It won't let me log out. Was it.
