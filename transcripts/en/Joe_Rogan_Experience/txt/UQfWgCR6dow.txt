Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello Freak bitches. It's societal standards and culture is a, is a big part of this. The way people decide what's acceptable, what's not acceptable. So to these people, I think for us growing up in America, it's almost impossible to understand what it would be like to be living in like one of the most radicalized parts of the world can understand the radical behavior, which is why I have no problem saying that a guy who went and did nothing but became radicalized. Like to me that's, that's a wrote mathematical equation right there. Like right. It's a, it's a hard one because you know, people still say to this day and age like, you know, you shouldn't, you shouldn't kill, right. We need to, the counter insurgency strategy is based off winning the hearts of minds of the people that were going into the countries that we're going into.

Speaker 1:          00:47          And I think the only way that I can describe it that makes sense to people with it might at least allow them to think outside of the education aspect. Is that, and you kind of, you, you alluded to the point a little bit, but I mean you have daughters, right? Do you love your daughters? Yeah. Like how much though? Like articulate for me how much you love, it's impossible for anybody to ever express it in a way that someone who doesn't have daughters would ever understand or sons or children. Totally. And so love is a good analogy because if you can understand how hard it is to articulate that, then you understand that there's another side of that coin and that there's a community of people somewhere on earth that hates you to the exact same degree that you love your children and can't articulate and would do everything they fucking can to end our way of life.

Speaker 1:          01:32          Because we let women go outside and have their skin exposed. You can say what you want, you can think what you want. And what's the solution to solve that? It's not books. There's not as a single, I could, I could put you in captivity for 14 years, Joe and I could never convince you not to live your daughters. Right? There's, this is not our job to change. But what I'm saying, hold on, let me what happened? So what I'm saying is though is that people think that there's, there's just like, oh, you don't have to go over there and you don't have to fight. Well fuck that. At some point you have to stand up for what you believe in. Right? And when it comes to those people that hate you as much as you love your kids, again, there's a small segment of that that you could probably turn with books in captivity, right?

Speaker 1:          02:16          Which is what's happening to the guys who get radicalized and get Mo. But for the other segment that would like nothing more than to end your life and everything you believe in. What's the solution? It's not fucking books. You know? What is the solution to try to turn a guy around once they've reached that level, radicalization he can't. So you either have to find something or believe in something to the point that you're willing to fight for it. Because here's the deal. We're x people. And then there's why people, and regardless of what your x is, your Christian Catholic, whatever your next person, there's somebody who's a white person, x and y people are going to fight. If you believe in what you believe enough, then to protect that at some point you're going to have to go beyond the educational aspect of that. And then by the time it's the podcast starts. So what's up man? You

Speaker 2:          03:00          know, you learn, you learn a lot about yourself, like listening to you listen to your own podcast. I you to the good ones. I don't at all. I can't, I can't stand this. I have no desire to listen to myself. The only time is when I'm going through mastering the system, my tutorial, I do sit there and I am interested in how I'm teaching and what I said and how I could have made the point clear in my teaching. So I, I uh, that's the only time, but when it's a podcast and I'm not talking about you did sit and I'm just talking about like just bullshit. I don't want to hear myself. It's good to hear though. But for the same reason like you realize why you were annoying to you like I have, I've found things that I didn't know I did like little s little ticks, little weird things like people do like a big one is saying like people like there's like Tom Segura I loved him to death.

Speaker 2:          03:50          That motherfucker out likes me. He hurts me sometimes. Like, like there's like a way like if you got like a guy like in his like a way like ah, did he say that or everybody does and what guys are telling a story. It's hilarious. And he's like, she came up to me and started mad dogging me and I was like, what the fuck you looking at? I paid for all that shit. And you didn't say none of that. You just said I was like that. I had that look on my, but I didn't say shit. And if you don't question did you actually say that? You're like, no. I was like, I was, I was thinking like by one of the ass too, you would have made it seem like you were just bad motherfucker. And this story [inaudible] out of you can say shit, and I was like, fuck you for that shit. He said that, no, no. I thought it like I thought it. Fuck you and you all and where you came from, bitch, did you actually say to him, no, man, I hate that. Another one.
