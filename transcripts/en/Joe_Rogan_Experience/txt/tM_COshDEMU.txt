Speaker 1:          00:00:13       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:00:17       I'm here with my brother, Daniella, but lily, one of the few men who can pull off a union gang Bandana, like some renegade bike or on an episode of Grey's anatomy. Look at that fucking thing, but you, you fucking balance it out with a Frank Frazetta, Conan the barbarian tee shirt. That shirt is the shit. Where'd you pick that up? Oh Man. I was looking all over the place for it. They probably had it for like some of the comic book store Milione are sickle and I thought that was a dope shirt. I might have to hide that one for my wife because she probably tried to throw it out. Why? I don't know. You know women are men. Come on. This contains Saturday decent. That's good in life. Maybe it's time to grow up. Maybe you shouldn't have a comic book guy and your shirt. It's not a fucking comic book. It's an. It's a novel. Robert e Dot Howard wrote a series of novels. It's about Conan the barbarian. People don't know. It's like my entire life philosophy is based off of our barrier like galaxies called mentoree. You can get in trouble for that kind of philosophy.

Speaker 2:          00:01:19       Crombs a good God could obviously solid because he doesn't give a fuck of here to help you. Nope. Not going to save you. That's the beauty of the color. It's very real. You know, it's like, Hey, life is tough deal to fuck with it because that's the way it's going to be. Yet there are horrible things that can happen. Yet there's no guarantees about the afterlife. Yeah, all of that. But in the meantime, there are women. There's red wine, there's enemies to be killed, or Marty wants probably parasites, all sorts of weird diseases. Nobody's ever diagnosed yet that parties did last year as I feel you're lucky you live to 30. It's kind of amazing when they keep finding these new species of people, you know, there was, um, they've just, they had this article yesterday where they're, they've examined the teeth, the teeth of the Hobbit, people on the island of Flores.

Speaker 2:          00:02:07       And so now they're like, you know, 99 point nine percent positive. It's 100 percent, not 99 point nine percent positive. One hundred percent, but 99 point nine percent positive that it's a completely different species of human being. They found the teeth of these things and you've got to think like that's the only like 14,000 years ago, you know, and we don't even remember those things. They're there. They've sort of become like this weird little legend, like how many different versions of people were out there and what a hard scrabble life it must have been extinct. Shootings, the name of the game. I mean, when you think about it, like overwhelming majority of pieces that I've ever been around. They've all gone extent. Yeah. More than 90 percent, right? Yep. So it's uh, yeah, it's uh, that's my point. Calling on the throats, you know, with, with bear claws, runs neck.

Speaker 2:          00:02:56       That's a fucking awesome picture. Yeah. That's why I it in my house as a pollster, I might have to be obsessed. I have a bunch of his old books for Zetas, old books like sketch books and books that are collections of his paintings. And God, that kind of art that he did was just so indicative of that time. It was like so 19 seventies fantasy art, you know those days, man, you know, but no one has really captured it correctly in a movie. They just have not done it right. You didn't, you didn't think of. The first one was fun and it was campy, but it was more like the comic book. Then it was like the books. I think Jason Mamoa was the best version of cone and physically he looked just the beginning that it was dog shit. Shameful. Their movie was dog shit.

Speaker 2:          00:03:47       That guy is awesome. I love that. Jason Mamoa. He's great. In game of thrones. He was. He seemed like the most likely Conan might have to get them on the Jews though. I know there's that to get them on some fucking heavy duty powerlifting program where he has to look a little more yoked because Conan was just supposedly ridiculously impressive as a person. I knew in fact, when they put power and old as the first one that's kind of high. That sets the bar pretty high right away. But. But Arnold was built incorrectly. He had all these unnecessary like big titty muscles, like you know, you need a guy who's built more like Yoel Romero, like a, like a barbarian Yoel Romero. The sword was me just to say that. But you're here and I want you to feel embarrassed. It's okay. It's okay. I can accept limits.

Speaker 2:          00:04:41       It's fine. So tell me about your book man. Not Afraid, uh, on fear, heartbreak, raising a baby girl and cage fighting. That's an unusual combination of things. That's what makes it interesting. No, I mean, to me these was um, oldest stuff I've written so far. What's going to have more Fritos, Alfie, cutting nature, DC's a bit more personal. These is very much um, my life. It's sort of divided up into three parts. The first part is about dealing with Fiori martial arts and he's kind of like my experience. Self stumps with the testing. The boundaries are getting crashed. Try again to find a way to make a deal with the skating feeling of when you have somebody coming in at you always been training for the last few years and wants to take your head off and you're like, shit, this is a little intimidating. There's all the pressure of people watching you.

Speaker 2:          00:05:30       The idea of getting fees if you fuck up and getting fuzzy, cuddly dominated by another man, which is never a fun feeling. That kind of shift and so that's that part. But then to me that fire just serves as a spring board for the other stuff which is about. That's good age when you are on the match when you're in the cage for that stuff. But what about the rest of life and in this case, you know, part tool deals with what happened with my wife, you know Betty Quique, a guy, all of a southern. What the fuck is going

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       on in your bodies are falling apart, diagnosed with brain tumor that within six months from the time the first scene Don came up. So it was really quick, really harsh. When will the stuff that you may imagine with debts and then the power three sort of, okay, now what you know, what do I do with it now and life afterwards when when my wife died, my daughter was 19 months old, the old, this shit was happening as you might imagine, and so it's like in some way that the story elements kind of go together is like the martial art part was circled for water mop in terms of learning some things that then I would have to apply on a much bigger, more important scale in day to day life and then you know, when shit hits the fan and then afterwards would. That changes my attitude about sayings, my life overall and, and you know, when I was talking with publishers or regionality, they wanted a nice pretty arch or you start out as the scared we wimp and then you discover the secrets and then you'll come back and Yardi, fearless guy will go through life without fear.

Speaker 3:          00:07:01       And that's bullshit. I mean it's. I like to sell it that way. That would sound cool, but I'm not in the business of bullshit in my saddle for anybody else. So I'm like, it's not the seven steps to get rid of. Fear is not that stuff. It's a, to me, my experience self dealing with fear, he's a fucking constant battle. You know, it's like you wake up a, um, you woke up one day and maybe you will learn to deal with it. The zero point zero one percent better and that's a win and that the next day a tto again, and you have to deal with it again. Like for me in particular, what afterwards, what happened is the reality of realizing that everything is fleeting. Everything can be taken away from you. Everything you care about can go in the snap of a finger. That really freaked me out.

Speaker 3:          00:07:48       You know that I use one thing to know it intellectually is one thing when it hits home for real. And so once in a while, you know, I left my days when I'm totally fine, I feel strong, I feel great, and then all of a sudden will hit me when the thought of men, everybody I love will die. There's, I've limited control of what's going to happen in my life. Everything I care about can be taken away from me in a second shift. Welcome to your day. Now deal with the next 24 hours is like savvy. And so dealing with that aspect, finding ways to and you know, and then I find a way to do it. And then a month later we'll hit you again. And maybe because you found a way to do it before he actually delay.

Speaker 4:          00:08:28       But don't you think that's everybody? There's no one. This is a false narrative that someone's figured out how to get rid of fear. It doesn't exist. If you have no fear, that means that you're not experiencing any danger or anything unknown. And somehow or another you're a mortal. Yep. Because if you think about the consequences of death, you're going to get nervous. You're going to get afraid if you're taking any sort of risks or chances, you're going to get nervous. It's part of being a person. Part of it's part of what's fun about getting things done in, in succeeding is knowing all the mental roadblocks that are in place to keep you from being successful big time, and that's the way today. They affect everybody. So to me, this is just, you know, these, these, my experience, but he's like, it's not that I have any illusion that a, I'm fighting battles that are unknown to other people because the reality is that everybody has shit to deal with.

Speaker 4:          00:09:19       Know every body has horrible things happen to them. Every body and you know, horrible may Vadie for one person to the next. You may be slightly luckier than the next guy, but the reality is that everybody deal with it. So the question of how do you deal with it? What are the things that I help you get the job done and which ones? That's one of the great things about martial arts, the dealing with the fear and the pressure and stress of training. It helps mitigate some of the pressures and stresses of everyday life. That's. That's exactly. That's why, you know, when I went to some publishers initially, they were like, ah, you know, the, your wife life. After we got that part about what the fact is, martial art I've had to do with data. I'm like, and it says everything to do with it, you know, because those are the same dynamics, but I get to train them in a safe space, know martial art contest and then you apply them to the real game.

Speaker 4:          00:10:06       I'm the big girl scaling. It's a controlled space and in terms of it's going to happen at 8:30 on Tuesday nights. You get in there, you know, it's like you can prepare for you eat for you, make sure you have your meal is digested in your stomach before you get there. You have a cup of coffee before you get to the gym. You stretch out, you prepare yourself and then you go through it. But, but in doing that it, it definitely helps. You know, I've, I've had so many twitter messages and facebook messages and people that I meet after shows that told me that they started Jujitsu after listening to this podcast and it changed their life and that it helps them so much and deal with pressure and now in pursuing a health, a healthy lifestyle. Like even guys like Anthony Bourdain who was in his fifties, I believe he was 58 when he started Jujitsu, the eight, 58, 57 or 58.

Speaker 4:          00:10:54       Um, he was a lifetime smoker. Heroin user, I'm like pretty much like abused everything. Alcohol, everything now is way more healthy. He's off. I talked to them off statens off of high blood pressure medication, lost 30 pounds just from training, eats healthy, still likes to party it up a little bit. A little bows on. But I'm, the guy looks great. He looks great and he's obsessed with Jujitsu and he loves it and it's sort of transformed his life. You know, his wife is a phenom. Yeah. So I saw she's a beast. She trains every day. I mean, she's essentially, I mean she's, that's her life. Her life was training. She loves him and uh, it just got them, it got them. She said that she talked him into doing it by promising him narcotics, which is one of the most hilarious stories ever. She said like, if you, if you come to train with me, I'll give you some vicodin. I'm in Nice. Well he's the one of the few guys

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       that has been like a self professed junkie but was not only able to kick it, but you know, still get high, still drink and obviously doesn't have a problem. It's very healthy. It doesn't do anything when he's at home and you know, when he's on the road in filming a show and the fillings done and he'll, you know, have a few drinks or even while filming, you know. But uh, it's not like he's got a problem. It's definitely is now a problem. I've hung out with him. He's, he's, he's healthy. Hey, that's as good as it gets. You've got to fire tea without paying the price. But it's amazing because everybody has this idea where most people that are in recovery that you can't do anything right. It was very few people I know that we'll do something like, I know a few guys who had alcohol problems, we'll smoke a little pot, but uh, or, you know, do a little mushrooms every now and then or something like that.

Speaker 2:          00:12:40       But he's one of those guys that he'll, he'll do everything other than the heroin. You know what I mean? If you can do that, I think he's everybody's psychology psychologist. Different. Some people, once they opened the door a tiny bit, right. Can Tell Dan I need to open it all the way. I kind of stopped. But then if you know your, that kind of person yet, then don't open into tiny bits then you shouldn't. But if you are not, then what the hell is wrong with enjoying a little bit if it really does. I think it depends person to person. Some people can do it that other people have to go cold Turkey or they can't. Yeah, that's definitely, that's definitely true. It's um, it's just cool to see someone do something positive always is because it gives you. Inspiration is a real fuel for human beings.

Speaker 2:          00:13:21       When you see your friends or someone you know that you like and they're doing something that's really transforming them and helping them, it fires you up to. Yeah. I'm like the biggest way and every time I see you're the cheesiest the speciation of do I start crying like a baby. I'm like, move it. It's everybody sitting. Go like that to such pitch. I don't cry over sad shit that much though. It's weird, but it's. My cat died. I didn't cry. I knew I've had her for 19 years. I didn't cry. I felt bad. I felt sad, but I felt like, well she lived a great life and she was a cool cat. The but um, it's not like if something cool happens, something cool happens. I'm like, wow, you know? Yeah, I'll have the same thing, but it's like, I think it would be like, come on, can I afford it? That's what a bitch. Where does chrom hang out? These colleges having another. He has a different place, right? I forget where it is. They mix the toppling Balaji's though. They played Lewis, but yeah, I don't remember what crumb, where chrome hung out.

Speaker 2:          00:14:26       Civy already human heads. I was giving me a hard time on twitter the other day and it just for a Goof, he was spelling was so atrocious. I was like, oh my God, what does this go into? Like I love it when people get mad at me over. It was like a Ted Cruz posts. He got mad over a. So I went to his twitter page and uh, I was just reading these posts about him looking up into the heavens. Wondering what, you know, what God is like living in the clouds. Like this motherfucker serious. Like, dude, we could. You could drive a fucking plane through the clouds, asshole. All right. There's nothing up there. That shit was back when people didn't have planes right now that we have planes. You can't say that. God's right up there, man in the closet. No, no, no. Fucking southwest is up there going right through the clouds with a jet and they give it out. Free. Peanuts.

Speaker 2:          00:15:21       Peanuts. EBC Dog got docking trying to avoid the planes. And Tim it, these Ted Cruz motherfuckers are scary. They got a little victory under their belt and Iowa and they're doubling down on the Bible readings. That's scary to me. Oh, that fucking guy. Then we'll kind of take party socks, but that I probably come parked has gone so far off band that is just downright nuts. Well, did you ever see that guy tweeted a quote the other day from Barry Goldwater were barren, cold water back in the fifties. It recognize that there was an issue with preachers and ministers in getting involved in the Republican Party, that they would ruin it. I know. That's the scary thing is that you'll go back 50 years to the guys work when see that are not Kansas back in the day and they would be considered moderate centrist today. They'd be like, oh, Barry Goldwater. What the reasonable voice. He would always. He was the one that was warning against it. Right? But no, exactly. That's what I mean. He's like, he had some positions that were three men, but he will set a bunch of others that were very, very reasonable the way it made sense, you know, and today he will be seen as fucking liberality.

Speaker 2:          00:16:24       Yeah, it's a, this, these are strange times where it's the most, it's kind of strange because this is the most advanced, uh, as far as our ability to access information. It's never been like this before and as far as our ability to access studies and find out the actual real scientific facts about certain things. But this is like, it's more important now to profess a love or a belief in God when you're running for president, I think, than ever than ever. You have to say it. Like everybody has to say it. Yeah. There's never been one sad guy who could just skirt the question and not discuss it. You have to go in and believe what I believe or not believe what I believe because I'm about to give you not want to make sure that is like, I thought I just stay away from the political discussions because they are.

Speaker 2:          00:17:15       There's no point in the weekend about zero point one sec when it becomes, fuck you, fuck you. And it's just there's not even a. yeah, there's not even like I get it. If we had to eat our school and through oversee, okay, that can be fun. It can be interesting to hell. We can even let her for some stuff from each other, but that's not even that point is just pure crazy extremist insults back and forth and I'm like, just as my all time favorite election all time. Oh, it's the stupidest yet. Is the shittiest choices. The least inspired candidates. This is the best one for me. This is the best. That's the only thing. He had a whole show going on about

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       how happy he was that Donald trump was in the race for the entertainment factor that does it because he was sick. He was making a good point because they say look, like in the primaries, for example, in the Republican primaries, the game is you have to go zero point. One millimeter more conservative than the next guy when the primaries, but you don't want to go too far because otherwise you lose the janitor of the lecture and you have trampled steps in and it goes like 20 yards past everybody else. Everybody else is like, shit, if I don't follow you, but lose the primary, but if I follow him, I'm done in the general. So that was having a blast with that. He was laughing. Which episode is a. is a common sense or is either. Why not? Maybe after the first Republican debate, that's what he was.

Speaker 3:          00:18:30       God, I got to go listen to that throat. I mean, that's. That's the way it is. Well, Donald Trump has nothing to lose. Yeah. I don't think he really wants to be president. I really don't think he does and I think that's why he's so outrageous, but I think along the way he's kind of fucked himself because this is what people have been asking for. People for the longest time have wanted someone believe him or don't believe I'm agree with him or don't agree with him. He's speaking his mind right when he's saying he's saying because he doesn't give a fuck. There's no filter whatsoever. He's talking about Mexicans. Well, someone's doing the raping. Fuck, this guy's running for president. It's time for putting a wall up like some fucking Berlin Wall up between us and Mexico. Like, Holy Shit, man, that seems reasonable. Does it? It's going to let Railo that over the rapists one does.

Speaker 3:          00:19:24       There's no represent. Well, someone's doing the raping. Someone's doing the raping here. Jesus Christ. That was half of the sixth grade. You can't even. You can check like maybe a non on site or it's hard to keep track of which was started. Odl was bullshit. Well, because they are so similar that it was wide where they asked him something about what does it take to make a, make America great again. Adhere had through this whole speech where he's clearly not answered. You know, he said running around just throwaway toward salad. That had nothing to do with the question at that. He tends with him going like, oh, I look at the police turned up. That's an awesome at it. Like this. Like I've got to leave with this question because I don't want to deal with it. They look at the guy with the announcement. Yeah, well he's a good medium man.

Speaker 3:          00:20:09       He's very good at. He's been doing interviews for years and he's also been on that reality show for a long time. You got fired from it while running for this election because of the inflammatory stuff. He said about Mexicans though. It's a. But I agree with you and this is entertaining it past the point of being to the point that it's entertaining. That's why I would dig a agenda that Sean tramping sanders because at that point teacher so wild and weird that he's enjoyable. You got, you know, the professional guys were like, they measure every single statement, uh, you know, the politically internet. It's, it's boring. You can write or the radio every single, you know already

Speaker 2:          00:20:47       what's going to happen, right? It's with someone. These guys, you have no idea what the hell is going to come out of their mouth. It's makes it for, hey, at least I got to watch something that doesn't put me to sleep there. Well, you want to talking about putting me to sleep, Hillary Clinton puts me to sleep because there's nothing inspiring about what she's saying. Nothing inspiring about her presence or her speeches, but I think my daughter, my seven year old daughter said it best. She goes, I would vote for her because she's a girl. That's a lot of people feel like that. I know. I know. I know. I know. Like fuck it. We had a black man. Let's have a white girl. Right. But it's like maybe you can pick some, but okay, sure. You want that. Pick somebody back there. Jesus just who's better?

Speaker 2:          00:21:28       Elizabeth Warren. Nine. She's not in anymore. Right? She, she dropped out, but when she was running they found out that she wasn't really native American and she tried to fake that. You get a scholarship or something for that. I think that's what he was the, the drop down the hall of fake. That's one thing you can't fake. You can fake like you're one eighth Swedish. They will give you a hard time about it. But if you say you one eighth, native American and Torres on. Oh No, that's fucking native American is like noble and mystical and you have like magic fucking eagle power. So you can hear like a wolf that if you watch all the 19 sixties movies, they were like Batty Indians will come into sculpture and chop your head off. Why? Because they already know what the fuck knows why. It's like the dragon in the story, right?

Speaker 2:          00:22:14       Pulse 19 sixties is old. Hug the furry creatures of the forest. I have a visual and said it's not what it was. It was the guy in the commercial that cried when he saw the ground, the garbage on the ground. Oh, that's what it was. And incidentally that guy too was fucked up is that that guy in that commercial where the Indians crying because white men are littering, but we from the sixties on, we've sort of associated native Americans like spiritual things like dream catchers and this guy, that guy is a Guinea. He's from fucking name. The same island has me looking at me and his canoe is seeing the pick it up. You fucking driving right past it. You don't have to just look at it. Dude, throw it away. Jesus Christ. Give a hoot. Don't pollute, but give a damn. Pick that shit up man. And he would, he would pull up in his stupid fucking buffalo skin canoes and cry. That was new. But guys, so Italian, he could be on the sopranos that made them wear a wig and shit. Yep. People are throwing things out the window right at his feet and he could ice.

Speaker 2:          00:23:28       Oh, it could all go to Bonnie fuel. I don't cry too. Something about keep America beautiful. Yeah. Well it definitely shouldn't be like hanging out by the highway either. So yeah, it doesn't tell. Just standing there was moccasins on and shit. Yeah. But, but native Americans from like that point on where they're associated with like a sweat lodge is pod ceremonies and spiritual things and you know, we have these ideas. There's a lot of people, they have these ideas of native Americans that they lived off the land and they used every last piece of the animal and they had a spiritual connection to their surroundings, which, you know, a lot of is true. There's a lot of truth in that, but that's the problem with stereotypes, right? You take 17, that's partially true, and then you blow it up the entirety of the experience, so torn with the carrier at that point is very far from debbie out of the deal.

Speaker 2:          00:24:20       Well my friend, Steven Rinella, the host of the mediator has the best stories of native Americans. He has a deep knowledge of the history of native Americans and he's got some fantastic stories about the Nez perce. First of all, they were fucking cannibals. Alright. That was super common to not only attack neighboring tribes, but to eat them, eat their babies, eat their family. Yeah, eat them rail. Yeah. There was a lot of cannibalism going on in the old west, especially apparently amongst the Great Lakes area in the Great Lakes area. That's for sure. Why is that? Is it just because it's called know different people? You know? It's kind of like the culture. In fact, that's why it's hard to generalize with distinctions among native stuff is so much difference. You know, the guys put on them to Great Lakes have nothing to do with the guys from the plains to do with.

Speaker 2:          00:25:08       So each one is. But yeah, good. A plague stuff is pretty intense. The fire that I liked the most about that is on you will, would go out to get captives, you know, you will go on at wateraid, you'll get copies this and once you see you get captured, you have one of two options. If they like you, then they adopt you as a family member. You replace one of their dead family members so you get treated that way. You are love you. They don't like you so much. Then they torture you through that over a four day period. So it's, yeah, it's blitzing skydeck, but it's kind of a flip of a coin data, which I guess are lyrically clean. Tony was a good thing, but for everybody else, not so much. Yeah. He told me the story of this one guy got captured.

Speaker 2:          00:25:47       There was two guys captured. One Guy, they killed him, killed him in front of his friend, and then they told him, I think they might've aid them in front of his friend too. They killed them and then they told him, we're going to take off all your clothes. We're going to let you run and if you can get away you can live. And so this mother ran like the wind jumped in the freezing cold river and hidden a beaver dam. Nope. He got smart enough to climb up into a beaver dam, which by the way is a risk and a fucking half because what if it climb in there and the beavers in there that beavers gonna fuck you up. People have died from before. If beaver bites your artery leader or shoot, they shoot the retreat. That will fuck you up. And uh, this guy, he fucking made it and he walked for days and some ungodly amount of miles naked by the way, freezing cold, lived off of whatever he grabbed and stuff in his mouth and eat that. And I managed to survive some crazy way and lived to tell the story. Some of the. That's what

Speaker 4:          00:26:44       I dig like for history on fire, those kind of stories that are so like, it's like, come on the screenwriter from game of thrones, throne that right, it can be real and then you dig it and he's like, no, there's reality and there's wars and it's more intense than anything you could imagine the revenant. Isn't that based on a real story and. Yeah, it's um, yeah, that don't. Is that guy as bigly entail? They kind of tailored it a little bit, you know, there was no Indian song and there was none of that power to. It's always an Indian. I know there's no sell it to white people. You've got to throw an Indian in there. The them like they been into black elk hunting and then the Grizzly fucking game up or just two guys leaving for dad and taking off even with this rifle.

Speaker 4:          00:27:26       That's all true. But yeah, they, they tweak it a little bit. Somebody needs to write a movie about that suit Akins lady that lives up in Alaska because that lady got, she's the one who's on that show life below zero. I heard about it. I guess she lives 200 miles plus above the arctic circle in this place called Kavach. She was one of my guests. She's amazing. Amazing. I mean, she is as fucking gangster as a human being can get by by just being awesome. Just so cool. He's a really nice, intelligent woman, you know, she's, she's just like so powerful. Anyway, she was up there and she got attacked by a bear and fucked up real bad. Broke her hip. I think. Broke her leg, fucked her head up. I think it cracked her skull like serious, serious injuries. She survived. She crawled back to her, her dwelling.

Speaker 4:          00:28:19       She doesn't even live in a house because where she lives, you're not allowed to put permanent residences. So they're like 10 things that are up there. Yeah. They're made out of cloth. These like weird sort of buildings with like wire structures and it's thick canvas tops and she was there for days before someone. She owns like a refueling station up there. Someone flew in, they found her, they brought her to medical help and patched her up, fixed her up. She heals up, goes back, shoots that bear and eats it. That's the way he wanted to do it. That pitches gangster as fuck. Yeah. You imagine eating a bear just cutting into the you motherfucker. Not So cocky.

Speaker 4:          00:29:01       That's a bad ass revenge tale. Let's do it. Fuck yeah, man. To her watching the revenant. He's like, yeah, that's Thursday morning. Whatever. Come on Pussy. I mean, it's amazing. The cloth fan. Norco for the Arctic. I mean that we Mahal for would be with right. She's a grandma. A. Yeah, of course. He's like pinched the gun kids, so I've seen the bear's heart. Jesus Christ. She's crazy. Yeah, but that's what she enjoys. She enjoys living out there in the wilderness with the wolves and foxes and the bears and the Caribou. She loves it. She loves going out and shooting or meals

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       and bringing them home and cutting it does all the butchering. All the food she gets, she gets from the land around her. She's just a wild. It's just like the life she loves. She found it and, and she's smart man. Like she could do a lot of shit. She's not a in an unresourceful person who's trapped up there. She just really truly enjoys it. That's a choice native person, which is absolutely fascinating person. She's one of my favorite all time guests. I need to move back to Danielle. He bought his course. I need to go back and catch that one. I think I saw he was there and I didn't catch it too. I need to listen again, so he's amazing. Myself or I missed it. I would like to go up there and hang out with her. She sounded awesome. I would have to go up there in the winter though.

Speaker 2:          00:30:23       Otherwise it'd be a pussy. You can't go up there. Hey Kim in July, but I bet it's cold fucking July to. Yeah, exactly too, but I think. What is the time of year where you go to see the Aurora Borealis? The northern lights? I haven't been. I don't know. I think that is a summer thing. Is that a summer thing or is that an all year round thing? No idea. I don't know either, but that would be worth traveling just to see. That's supposed to be insane. Yeah, that's like the whole sky is filled with green missed either died or you can stay in La and take them out. Shirt with sudden. You've got to say, but it's better, right? Yeah, that's better. You have to know that. Just. Do you ever been to Alaska? No. Never know. What's crazy about it, man? It's how big it is when you fly over it, you go like Jesus Christ and you look at it on a map.

Speaker 2:          00:31:11       You're like, what the fuck? That place is? I think it's the biggest state. Is it the biggest? Isn't really. Yeah, by far. Jamie says. Yeah, I think it's like almost too Texas's. Seriously. They do some really shitty job with man. Find out how many Texas's fit in Alaska. Oh, they do a shitty job with math does not look like two times. Texas. Well, if you ever seen how big Africa really is, like when people talk about Africa, I think people get this idea that Africa, the continent of Africa is similar to the continent of North America, but it's not even close. Look at this sick Jesus Christ twice the size of Texas. Yeah, that is huge. Damn. Alaska is larger than all but 18 sovereign countries. Holy Shit. Look how big it is when you put it in the middle of America. Freaky fucking a man. God. It's huge and it's so lightly populated.

Speaker 2:          00:32:05       It's amazing. I fucking love it up there. I got to get back. When was the last time? Two years ago, Ari Shaffir and I did a anchorage. We did a comedy show up there and went salmon fishing. Saw some. I saw my first movie I ever saw some eagles for the first time. That was awesome. He goes, or he told me that they were pretty intense. Oh, there's. So. It's so strange when you look in a wild eagle in the eye, you know, even though it's kind of far away and they don't let you get that close to them, but when you're passing by, we were on a boat and we're passing by these trees and there's an eagle up in the tree and you're like, Whoa, what the fuck? I big fucking animals. That's for sure. They don't get hunted by people either, so they're not afraid of people, but you know, they're not stupid either, but that places a legitimately wild place in that when you get out of your car, you have to run to where you're going.

Speaker 2:          00:32:58       Are you going to get swarmed by mosquitoes that. Yeah, that's what I heard about. That's the part that I didn't like about Alaska. I call it sound awesome. And then I heard about the level of like, intensity is mosquito wise. I was like, yeah, okay. That Ari and I were laughing. We couldn't even believe it. Like this is ridiculous. Like I'm not kidding, like open up the car door. Um, put your boots on and just the time it takes to open the door and get your boots on the car is filled with mosquitoes, like hundreds of mosquitoes, like a swarm. They find you instantly. What's about to climb out there that attracts mosquitoes so much? I think they're just fucking desperado because they know they're only gonna be alive for a month, you know, that's what I think. And there's like three humans to buy it and sanders. Gotcha. I think, I mean, do they bite other animals? Right? Definitely. So I just don't think that they have much time. I think they only stay alive for a short period of time, so while they're at it, they're addicts, so they are berserker mosquitoes. Just going for it then. Well yeah, that's a scary fucking place. Fuel have. Yeah. More so than Florida. You would think like Florida mosquitoes would be the most rabid. That's how you figure tropical place. Lots of humidity. All of the Florida people though they're fat and lazy.

Speaker 2:          00:34:13       They could get these. It's like, ah, there'd be another tourist. I couldn't get that one. I don't have to chase these one. Yeah. Florida has its own problems though, man. Florida is. It's so funny. They're doing a big python hunt now because so many people have released pythons in Florida that they, they've bred and overread. They have like a gigantic python invasion problem to the point where they're offering rewards for people to kill Python's. The headlines that come out of Florida, one of the things that are at constant stone source of entertainment, you get things that are like, again, these must be the on your right. It's too fucking crazy. Then you it into like, no, that was real. That really up and yeah, there's a great twitter page called Florida man and it's just filled every day. There's some new crazy shit some guy tried to do while huffing paint. Fucking dog.

Speaker 2:          00:35:04       It just, it's not a real state. What did I read? What was the last thing? Oh yeah. This guy was um, at all been a house and I think the owners get back. So the guy to call and they were looking for anyway. Flashlights like it dove in this pond right outside alligator. Exactly. Yeah. Team. Yeah. I've heard that before. There was another one recently real similar where they were chasing this guy in a stolen car. The guy gets to a bridge, jumps off the bridge and immediately gets jacked by an alligator, like literally jumped on an alligator. Good timing. Good job man. But you got to be fucking crazy to jump in the water with those things, man, if you've seen. Have you seen an alligator scared be big ass fucking dinosaurs. They're not as dangerous as Nile crocodiles, which coincidentally have also been released in the everglades. Good. They have a shoot on sight kill on site order. If anybody sees a Nile, crocodile is supposed to kill them onsite because they've started to breed in the everglades. So you're talking about those 18, 20 foot long, gigantic African crocodiles that take out willdabeast yeah. Let's say you live in Florida too.

Speaker 2:          00:36:14       Yeah, that's a rough state. It's funny man, because all the tree huggers, they're like, don't kill the pythons. Not Their fault. Like, okay, you know how big pythons kit you crazy bitch. They're gonna. Eat your family. They'll. They'll eat babies, they eat people. Fuck man. Florida. The joys of nature. I've been watching narcos on Netflix. Thinks about it. So good. I'm sad because there's only two episodes left and I don't know if they're doing a second season. I don't know if they can. I mean, I think Pablo Escobar gets caught. I think that's the end of that, unless it goes on further. I don't know though. I wasn't totally aware of the entire story of Escobar. I just knew that he was a drug dealer and I knew, fuck man, those guys. Look, it's so well done to the show. So. Well done. Yeah, no, that's a.

Speaker 2:          00:37:07       that's on my watch list because I ever done it. Every single person I talked to told me to tell someone that one insane he went to war. I mean I don't really want to tell anybody anything about it because it's fucking shocking and it builds up really well. Like it really builds up well from the early days of his drug dealer. Just finding out about drugs to the end. But that's what's funny about it that people got old like, oh the Kadima now the mafia, that when you look at like mafia stories, they are identical to the history of any state or if any nation, you know, it. Just the dynamics that are. Did you know wine is in a suit and tie. The other one is with the AK 47, but other than that, the bezirk seeing. Sorry, it's a struggle for power. It's a game off fuck over your enemies sheets.

Speaker 2:          00:37:54       The other one who can get you do what you can expand your. It's the same story over and over. Whether you're talking about that extended to great or fabulous go buyer is not that different. Really know the specifics are slightly different, but the big picture is not. It's a struggle for power. End of story and it seems like when you get to the really high levels of finance and of volume and the amount of troops in the amount of people that you're controlling the area control, that's when the real trostle he's kicking like you almost. It's almost a universal that horrific acts get done to intimidate your enemy and to make sure that you retain control over certain certain areas.

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       Yeah, it's hard to sing. Where is like in that sense you might. History's really kind of fucked up and weird when you. If you approach it with them through a moral lens because you see so many nasty things take place and in the weird ones are the ones who were. There really is no good solution where you don't know what the healthy thing would be like. There's one that I was researching for a history on fire maybe a year from now or something. I was searching distorted from the 19 eighties in El Salvador. At that time there was a a right wing government in El Salvador to the US government was supporting and there was a leftist gallery are there was in the logic of the cold war. There are only two options here, either protocol, Muni story, our pro us. There's nothing in between. Right? So in the process of fighting these leftist Galleria, the government of El Salvador is doing nasty things right to anybody will criticize them, doesn't matter whether they're a communist or not.

Speaker 3:          00:39:25       To get tortured that chop off their bodies will leave them in the middle of the streets. American Congress at that point because like, oh shit, you know, we can really keep sending millions of dollars to. These guys were doing horrible human rights violations, so they pass this law that in order for any more aid to be sent to the governor of the sound of other, the president of the United States has to sign off on a document stating that these guys have made huge improvements in their human rights record, that they are on the right path, you know it's getting better. Problem is the deadline is coming up that a gun is each and to be able to send out all these millions of dollars to the government of itself rather and in that moment, the Salvadorian army on these offensive against the gallery and they find some villages that just wanted to be left the fuck alone.

Speaker 3:          00:40:13       They were not pro communist, but they are not anticommunist theater. They were like bunch of Evangelical Christians, peasants who just wanted to farm their fields and be left alone so he. They will lead. The communists go through. They will let the army go through to figure if we stay neutral. Everything works out right? Well, not in the Cold War and the Cold War. There is no neutrality are either on one side or the other, so Salvadorian army come in, grab every single villagers, separate the men from the women, kilos demand or April. The women don't kill them all, kill everybody in that village and New York Times. The New York Times did an article on it and I'm now. Reagan was like, Oh shit, what do I do now? So he said, the guy who wrote this article, it some crazy communist. None of these is through is a smear campaign against our allies. The government has made huge improvements.

Speaker 3:          00:41:00       I'm sending that millions of dollars of course years down the road and saw that the original story, it was through that the staff did that happen and the but other than bitching about Reagan, this is not even an anti Reagan thing is that it's a messy situation because you do support the government of Assad rather. You're literally supporting death squads. Child rapists mean it doesn't really get any worse than that. You don't support them. There's a chance that hillside rather who turn into a communist state, in which case he's not exactly like communism around the world is a higher reputational for human rights. It's fucking awful. Right? So he's like, what do you choice here? No, the you choose to support them or do you choose? It's like, how do you see what I'm going like? It's a situation where no matter what you choose, you're fucked.

Speaker 3:          00:41:46       You're doing bad things. But clearly the moment our support in death squads that can not be the right solution, but at the same time, what is the right solution? What is the good thing you should do? You know, character at the same exact problem. You know? Right before Reagan Carter, some guide, the Archbishop of El Salvador, this guy, Oscar Romero sent him a letter saying, stop fucking sending money to my government because they are doing horrible things with it cart. I was like, Eh, I don't want to look at this because this is politically traveling for me. So two weeks later that squats, walking into the main church and outside of authorities, guy was celebrating mass. They gunned him down, killed him, so he's not a Republican or democratic thing, you know, it's like both sides of the game. They are did not know how to handle this in a situation where it's like which mass murderers and we support and which ones do we oppose because that's the reality of it was like those are the stories or like what the fuck do you do?

Speaker 3:          00:42:45       What is the right thing to do? Windows case, there almost is no right thing. Right, exactly. When you're dealing with certain parts of the world that have been embattled, they've been just in inter tangled in these horrible bitter feuds and rivalries. Horrible things get done and war and when you're dealing with two horrible groups and you can't really differentiate substantially one being more moral or ethical that over the other one and oftentimes like if you were more and more or more ethical, you wouldn't survive in those terrible environments. Like you have to do horrible things just in order to stay above water and that's what keeps it. The stories keep you on your toes because if you condemned wine and not the other yarn, paypal credit, if you can. Then the other, the first year and a booklet, if we get even to what we are seeing, which is the right thing, right, is like, well, it's a fucked up situation and you have to do terrible things.

Speaker 3:          00:43:38       If you say too easily, it's like, oh yeah, well, so go chop. The kids had had off no big deal. So you have to, you say Baylor, so safe to say the opposite. It's like it's a weird dynamic there where there's no real place where you feel comfortable. Like, ah, that was the right thing to do. I can glad we made the right call. Now I can go through easy and stuff. Well, let me ask you this because you're a legit historian. Was there ever a time in human history where there was like a noble ethical government of any sort of, uh, an empire or country that didn't engage in any human rights and did the right thing? Like was there a utopian government and anytime in history? No, I think you've got these different degrees of fucking up. Some degrees they're like, ah, that's not that bad.

Speaker 3:          00:44:22       Come on. We can. We can live with that, but we can live with. That does not mean it's good. It's still kind of Shitty is just a lot less shitty than the alternatives outside of modern times. What's the most Utopian version of a government that ever sort of ran? I think what you get is in you do around into society. Swear may be like for example, if you have low population, vancity hunters, I'm glad that are, but the keyword being low population density because once you have too many people, they compete for hunting grounds and they do horrible things to each other, but if you have a relatively low population density, these guys, there's really no reason to go to war with another tribe over wealth because they are nomadic. You have to fucking carry it on your back. You don't want. I don't want your shit.

Speaker 3:          00:45:04       They have to carry it to them. That's part of the work, so you don't do. You don't fight over weld. You don't fight over religion because most of these guys have have kind of inclusive approach where whatever you do that works good for you. There's no competition there, so you have removed two huge things that people do nasty things to each other over. They're still fighting over. I'm hunting grounds. They're still fighting over women, so that will still happen, but so it's not an idea like utopia. Oh, those noble hunters and gatherers who could do no wrong. No, they did horrible things to each other. They just have less reasons to do so. Then later societies, so agriculture in cities and civilizations, that's when things started getting really rough. Well, I mean, again, it's the placenta mine Australian glasses because you stay in one place and you can accumulate wealth.

Speaker 3:          00:45:54       Now I don't have to carry every single human on my back. Every few days I can sit in one place in the coma late. Well, you do start seeing the growth of social class as you do. Start seeing. I mean, I'm a hunters and gatherers. You don't have reach hunter and gather under poor line. You know, everybody's kind of on the same game. When you become sedentary, you can accumulate wealth and so you do start seeing these game played out in the good way. You know, people who have the resources to dedicate themselves to staff other than working for a living and so on and in a horrible way. We told the nastiness that take place over the fighting over. I want your shade is a little terrier family in order to get what I want. You know, so it's, that's why to me, when you read those and as usual with human beings, there's always a good and bad kind of logic is you have.

Speaker 3:          00:46:39       The guys were like, man, Petey, Yoga, culture sock. He was a horrible, harsh life where it was terrible and every and how can I call it? You're a devotee body and states are wonderful and all that. There's an element of truth to that and there's also an element that's not and vice versa. The Guy, White Lis hunters and guides that are says the best you once ever, and they could do no wrong. It's like up to a point, you know, even both scenarios, there are some huge advantages in some huge these advantages. He just that they change which ones they are. Yeah, when you get so much wealth and so much prosperity that you start getting royalty when you start getting people that accumulate massive amounts of wealth and then they have this incredible ability to control all the people around them and everyone's fearful of them because they have ultimate power that can have you killed instantly and face no repercussions. I was reading

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       this article about this guy who is some Middle Eastern print and he was living in Beverly Hills. Did you hear about this guy and you want to do sexually assaulting people that worked for him and they arrested him and then he fled the country that we gotta wait, wait. He was saying like, you know, you can't do shit to me. I'm a prince, you know, and he's like saying that to them like was 2016 and he's still like, I'm a prince. Should I know that wasn't even one like that. Fuck, I wish I remembered the details. I kind of lost them, I think. I don't want to say. Well, there was two of them real recently. There was one, maybe you will remember it, but the right. There was one where to justification was didn't rape her. I fail on air and I just had been to Bri.

Speaker 2:          00:48:12       Was that dye penetrate those in the UK though? That was in the UK. The wars. The fencing to history. Like if you can come out, let out. Are we going to defend this guy? Let's be Goodi thought like she was under age. Yeah. You'll get laughed out of the room like the defense ever and he got acquitted. See if you can find that. He fell on her and how did they acquit him? They, whoever was on that jury, I guess it was a jewelry or whatever. Who the judges follow that guy forever. I wouldn't say that their bank accounts for somewhere. You're going to find a hole in the ground where the bag of gold. Here it is, British Manitoba Police. He may have penetrated teenager after falling on top of her cleared of rape. Whoa. Was a British millionaire who told the police may have pantry, teenager, director fall on top of, has been cleared of rape, a try saying that name as Han Abdulaziz was accused of forcing him, said, oh, she was 18, 18 as she slept on the Sofa in his Lincoln apartment after a night of drinking at an exclusive nightclub when he was questioned, the 46 year old businessman said he had slipped and fallen on top of the girl, which may have caused his penis to penetrate her.

Speaker 2:          00:49:28       I'm fragile. I fell down, but nothing ever happened to me and this girl, I'm fragile so I can keep my balance. You know about a pinnacle, have great aim because somehow he managed to find her vagina with the jury, acquitted him of one count of way rape after just 30 minutes of deliberations. Wow. That jury is going to be a tank coon. Big Time. They're going to be on a fucking yacht, Paula to to like a Jay z video doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo to to. Well, it's also fear to when someone has that kind of thing, you've got to wonder, is he a billionaire to say bi or men air? Well Posey have a billion come on son. I wonder how how he got away with that. That doesn't even make any sense. Unless they just picked a super sympathetic pro Muslim. I'm assuming he's Muslim with that name pro Muslim, but even. I mean it's like, come on, how did they do it? Well, I really think what

Speaker 4:          00:50:28       you laid out is the value option or I'll have you killed option are really the only two logical explanations because other than that, this is not a defense. This is the most. Like this is a late night joke. First of all, look at that guy's fat face and telling me that guy keeps a raging erection like all the time while he's walking around. That is not healthy at all. You're not 15. You're not like some. Some young boy with a throbbing heart on that. He just like literally it runs his life. That guy's probably lucky. Unless he's on Viagra. He's lucky if he can get it up here. Look at him, it's all fat and swollen like I was not healthy enough to have a rod is all the time. Fucking raging. Boner. Slipped Hodge. He's got it in there. You like his dick is like a like a heat seeking missile.

Speaker 4:          00:51:14       Just fly finds its way into vaginas. Only have to do is fall near the girl I in there. Yeah. It's not that easy here but. But what do you. You have to work at it. You have to work at it. Jury acquitted him. Well, yeah. There's no justice in the world. If I was at girl's dad or if I was that girl or her mom or anybody. The girl herself. Yeah. Find that guy. Yep. Well what is she saying? That he was as she was asleep and he just stuck his dick in her while she was out cold by Zip code and she woke up fucker today my phone inside, you know, big. Did you imagine the odd. But imagine if that's really what happened. Like what if he's like walking on hardwood floors a is a wearing socks and he steps on a piece of paper and just, whoops, she's still wearing anything.

Speaker 4:          00:52:06       He claimed he had gone to see if the young woman wanted a tee shirt to sleep in or a taxi home. But he said she pulled him on top of her and placed his hand between her legs. Oh, his semen and DNA were found inside the young woman. But he said it was possible that he had semen on his hands from having sex with a 24 year old earlier. Um, we more complicated if you got semen on his hands. How did he get it? Inside of her? I slipped in my penis. End. My hands went inside of her vagina is huge. It's got us. He's a God like that. Don't even make any sense. The she pulled him on top of her and placed his hand between her legs. Boy, that's a squirrely fucking story. Hmm. Early our, the young woman said she had woken up in the early hours of the morning with Mr Abdulla Aziz on top of her forcing himself inside of her.

Speaker 4:          00:53:09       He claimed he'd gotten to see if the young woman wanted to tee shirt to sleep in or a taxi home. Okay. I believe her. How about that? I think it story sucks. Well, this stories definitely socks about like slipping and falling into that sucks, but it sucks even more. I've gotten to see if she wanted a t shirt to sleep in or a taxi home. What a wonderful person you are. You are amazing. Did you also donate some money to a charity of your choice? I was up all night trying to help orphans, but it Horsley you think, how stupid do you have to be to make up your story? Because you can say you can throw it into a. He said she said kind of thing. No, it must consent in Charlotte. No, he wasn't. You know. Then it's harder world, right? There's an article there.

Speaker 4:          00:53:49       This is like the most fucking ridiculous story ever. How did you even sit down and say, no, no, I'm not going to go for the sexuality. They've got to recap this crazy weird estela like he make no sense. Meanwhile, he's free right now with his feet up on the coffee table, smoking a Cuban cigar, laughing. Probably getting his dick sucked by some Russian hooker. That's probably why the first few seasons stuff that backs there were so popular right before they fuck they thought, but buddy was still a good show. First season was awesome because everybody's got their thing right. There are so much nasty sheet that has been in the ward with no repercussions that everybody's got the fan. Does he off? Fuck you. I'm going to get you. Boy, did they fuck that show up? They took that. That show was like a work of art that the writers from murder, she wrote got a hold of and they just started.

Speaker 4:          00:54:35       Just shitting in the mouth of every character became awful. It was awful. I was so bad. People kept telling me, no, no, you got to give it a chance. It gets better. Fuck you. I don't have that kind of time in my life, you know, masochistic effort. I stuck through it. All I've seen is on the. I didn't know, get that idea and I think, you know, you got, you've got second team because you got the first three, four, five, whatever many sees on the first few are good, right? And did like three, four more than that. Really not. And, but you're like, no, but maybe they'll get the next one, right. Was like, yeah, that didn't all that. Um, and I, I, I really didn't realize what it was when it first came out, but it hadn't really changed. Was the first episode of the Sopranos.

Speaker 4:          00:55:20       It was a comedy. It was. Well, I mean, yeah, we are way. But yeah, there was a lot of comedic element for sure. Like when the woman had the machine gun and she ran outside with the AK 47, the wife like that was so out of character, like who she became later in the show. Like that episode was like, it was preposterous. Gang, family, you know, mom, family. It was weird. But even though they have some moments in there, like I don't remember, even at the end of season one where they are chasing these do through the woods to shoot him and the dude is like screaming all of a sudden one and definitely he's like, you got shot that. He's like, no, fuck poison ivy at his old piece of golf about that. And it's like they throw in these weird data bits to make it. He goes, it doesn't really well or eat them. Yeah. It was definitely really well written and it got better as it got darker and weirder got better. That was one of the few shows ever where they figured out a way for you to feel sympathetic about a murderer because Tony Soprano wasn't a murderer. He killed him. You liked him? Huh? Should I even add the height? Remember having nightmare self shit. The FBI trying to get me. I

Speaker 2:          00:56:23       have to hide the stuff I was. Because you relate to the guy. At least I did feel. I felt like it's a fucking exited heritage. Your last name as well. But it was a dark time for Italian American. So because everybody wanted to be like, connected to the mob was really dumb. East Coast Guineas, we're like, so celebrate Tori and they were upping older Guinness. That's painful. They would crank it up to a 10 guy with the thing and the goes like, hey, blamed the sopranos for Jersey Shore. I think that was a direct connection there. I think you have a point. Yeah. In the real housewives of Jersey, which is the most disgusting version of real housewives. Real housewives of Miami. They should just give them knives. They just give those bitches knives and let them cut each other. Was a fucking savages. But jerseys the grossest.

Speaker 2:          00:57:17       And then, uh, now that one family, the woman's in jail and she's doing time and then she gets out, the husband's got to go in because only one can stay out and watch the kids. So they take turns. Yeah. They take turns like a tax evasion thing, right? High five each other on the way you net out is like, okay, you're recording now. Go. I'm in favor of people going to jail for stealing things. But man, that tax evasion thing is a tricky one. How about you just fucking pay what you owe? How come? How come? It's the only time when you owe something, you'd go to jail, like fuel credit card money. You have to pay it, right? You know you owe student loan money. You have to pay it. You owe taxes, go to jail, bitch block you in a cage. That's nuts.

Speaker 2:          00:57:55       Gangster. You know they are the big gangster. That's what I mean. That's exactly what I was saying about sort of mafia and government's been identity cut the same shit. I mean even like the Mafia. It's funny because a lot of the early mafia stuff came up as a form of government. You know, when like in the south, they're neat that he went, God invaded by dishpan yards by the French. So the government was not on the people's side. They were a occupying force, trying to squeeze as much wealth out of the country as possible. So because they couldn't turn to the government, a lot of the people started turning into these, made up local organization, which eventually, because they provide all these services, but they are also the mafia, you know, they do instill deal with teaching staff. You can see the logic why besides academia now that element, the 90 devolves completely into Jessica.

Speaker 2:          00:58:39       You mean apply them into nothing goes. But he's like, there's no way, you know, there's a logic to it and it's immediate versus state university level, you know, the hierarchy of the way they handle these nice, you know, the whole thing gives me an alert on the state. Yeah. And if you look at the amount of atrocities committed per capita, I mean it's probably pretty similar. I mean the mafia does some awful shit but. So government. Yeah. So does the military. So I mean think about the amount of innocent people that are accidentally killed everyday during military. No, that's why you need to be a war to call and quit or worse or the mafia bosses. That's why those stories are the same thing. It's about the guy struggling for power against 80. I mean

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       the same thing over and over, you know, it's uh, yeah. The, the mafia has its ancient system of government and laws and rules and you know, so to the sandinistas the contras. So does you know the so did you can go down the line. So to gangas conduit. So did Alexander the Great. They all had their own sort of systems of government and rules that you had to live by. And speaking of getting gas gun, did you check out the show Marco Polo? Yes. It's good. I liked it. It's a good show. Yeah. They didn't finish it and they hate it, but equal that I know they did like a half hour on the bad ass. That waste among. Yeah. Pretty cool. Right? Doug? It's well written. It's a, it's good stuff. It's a very expensive show apparently. He said yeah, because they're, the sets are massive and they make it look like the, the Mongol era, like 1200.

Speaker 3:          01:00:12       So they don't kind of sell it for money because you know what kind of stuff for money to kill me. My probably my favorite tool for the times. Have you ever seen that Oma? Be One. Oh No. That was so good. It wasn't really an amazing, brilliant instruction at trait bits about it. I don't know. It was back when was it 2004 or five, something like that wasn't that long ago. It was a while back, but they only did two seasons, but they are fucking awesome. Like I watched every season twice, so maybe even more. It was that good. The main character, um, he's pretty much a variational call and, and it's so cool. The, oddly enough, the guy who created the show was Jamil Lewis was the guy with directed the first call and I was, the guy was behind a part of the creative directing of the early UFC.

Speaker 3:          01:01:00       He's the guy who wrote the apocalypse now. He standing so many of the sinks side dig and by. Yeah, that's your money if you have never seen it, check it out. I mean today looks tame by comparison cause so much stuff has been done afterwards. That's just dates a 10 notice before the time he was over 18 times with nudity and violence and the grittiness of it all. It's a. it's an awesome trauma. So it sort of opened the door maybe for things like game of thrones, bake time, big, big. That's funny how a show like that didn't catch on, but a show like game of thrones does, you know, or soprano's does. I think what he was is it almost actually doing fairly well but not well enough for the budget. I think the budget was too inflated compared to the results. The results are good.

Speaker 3:          01:01:42       You know, people liked it. The critical reviews or to create an audience you know is good, but you know the Sopranos, you shoot somebody silos, you know the budget is not going to be what you have to recreate. Ancient Rome when I could and scale. It's a different kind of game right there. So Hbo, I think he wasn't that old tanking is this show is doing well, but it cost too much fucking money. Those shows they didn't have the option of selling them on itunes back then. Did they know exactly what 2004? Did they have itunes back then? They kinda did. Right. I want to say that even dad would have been said much the early stages that isn't that crazy fucking 10 years ago. I know, but it's another universe completely.

Speaker 4:          01:02:20       It might as well be with everything, with social media, with everything. That's another, a whole nother universe. How many podcasts were around back then? Was there like a few people's 30 fucking with data, but nothing got a big scale yet. It's probably something. There's probably something. This podcast has been around since, um, for six years. So since 2009. Nine slash nine. 10 somewhere around then I think. I think we do and we were doing it in December of 2009, so right before 2010. Well, I'm sure when you started podcasting, Ward was a fraction of what it is today. Yeah, it was real small. So it's, um, Adam Carolla had one. Um, and there was a few other ones. You know, Adam Curry had one of the first ones and John Devork. Uh, but I, I didn't know about them. I didn't download them back then. I got the inspiration to do mine from Anthony because Anthony Kumina from opie and anthony had this set up in his basement where, uh, you know, he had a lot of money and he had a cool house.

Speaker 4:          01:03:24       He live by himself, so he put up a green screen and set up a stage where he had a nice desk and some real professional cameras and started doing this thing called live from the compound and live from the compound was like his own little fuck around, have some fun at home show we had like Guinness on tap and he would just drink and talk shit. And it was really fun to watch and I realized it was like, wow, here's a guy that's on serious, you know, he's on the opening. Anthony showed it's very popular show on Sirius and he's decided just for fun to do this thing in his basement that's not making any money from it. It's just for fun. And I thought about it and I said, you know what, I could probably do something like that. And so we started doing it off of, I'm just ustream just sitting there with a laptop talking shit that's.

Speaker 4:          01:04:11       So my podcast didn't become a like an itunes podcast for like a few months after the first one. We realized once we started collecting and we then took the audio and start putting it up on itunes. But there wasn't that much going on back then. And then, um, we got it in like right at the right time. And then like in the next few years, other comics started starting their own podcast, you know, and then everybody, you know, all these different people, Bill Burr and you know, and Dheas and Dunkin and everybody else started, you know, doing podcasts as well. And they all took off. Well you are single handedly responsible for like the [inaudible], like there are so many podcasts that are people who came through your show and then went, Huh, I should the one, you know, there's like a long list of people with a few. Yeah. I try to help him to. I want them to do podcast. I just think it's the best form of if, if you're a comic is the best form of expression where you can. You could just, you just talk to people, get to know the actual. You like 100 percent with you for three hours or it is when you do

Speaker 2:          01:05:17       yours over the course of 700 and now we're like 7:50, something 7:55, 755 podcast. Most of them intoxicated. Good percentage of them. I know. I've seen that lately though. It hasn't happened as much intoxication, buddy. You, there's some conversations you can't have toxic. She will just scatterbrained. I didn't want to talk about smurfs are fucking the edy's or something in the middle of someone talking about the economy or bit coin I feel there. There's some that lend itself to it and some that don't. It's really completely dependent upon the guests. What the subject is and I like to mix it up too. You know, that's the thing about being a marijuana enthusiasts unless you're like a Doug Benson Kinda guy who everybody just assumes is high 24 slash seven because that's kind of a shtick, you know, like even the name of his podcast, getting doug with high, like, let me get it.

Speaker 2:          01:06:18       You can't see, you can't speak, you know what I mean? I, you know, I don't think Pi, I think he's like everything else. It shouldn't be all the time for everything. Yeah. Everything. Yeah, it's a car. It could be a crutch and it's not a crutch, you know, it's um, it's a fun, beautiful aspect of nature and a great way to perturb your normal states of consciousness and give you some unique insight and yeah, it's a lot of benefits. It makes you feel good. It makes you enjoy wine and make. It makes me like very friendly, like pot makes me want to hug people and they'll tell you, you know, but I just think you should be cool with just life. I'm a big fan, so I have to say I'm a huge fan of the effect that has on female sexuality the way, at least in my experience, women that respond to weed wouldn't call.

Speaker 2:          01:07:12       The good ones do. Yeah. My best ally ever. It's definitely you feel like a god you've touched. Have multiple. Oregon's somebody up like that was easy. That didn't think much. Will it? Makes hugs feel good? Yes. Just hugs. Forget about sex. Just smoke weed and hug. It feels amazing. You know you ever done ecstasy? No. No. It's been on my to do list, but I've had a. You could hold hands with dude. When you're on ecstasy and you feel bad at all, are you going to do it? Can Be rubbing each others hands. Does it feel bad at all ever fucked one thing that it does. It's, it's fucking terrible for your brain. At least I should qualify that. That was when I did it. I probably did a little too much and uh, the next day I just was so fucking stupid. Now my brain didn't work good. I've talked to many people who don't have that problem, but they don't have to do the same sort of things with their brain that I have to do. So it's, it depends on what you do, like if you go to work and you have a normal job and you don't have to do anything important and maybe you know, great, maybe it's fine, but if you're a person who has to think for a living and you have to do like stand up comedy

Speaker 4:          01:08:16       on stage or you have to write or the podcast or something like that. Like I couldn't imagine doing ecstasy and then doing the UFC the next day. Yeah, that would be a rough. I, I wouldn't be able to do it. That kind of the whole theory that there are these, I don't know what Saturday are, but that you take after you take ecstasy. HTP, is that what it takes that allow you not to have the Dow and thereafter words? I've never done it. Um, but I would imagine, you know, like I said, only did actually once in the one I did. I just totally did it naturally. But I do take five htp, I take new mood, which is five htp and l trip to fan. That stuff definitely works. Hey. But I've never done it in conjunction with that with acid but, or with molly or ecstasy.

Speaker 4:          01:08:56       But actually that's how it got invented. That's how new mood got invented. Really trying to figure out a way to mitigate partying. I love, I mean that's just as it was called roll off did the other day and she had these old perfect scheme for basically every legal prostitution by using a loophole that, you know, if there's a cabinet, our role in that. It's part is not the restitution. That was true. It was true. I at even sign a contract, you could hire someone, sign a contract to, uh, to have, uh, a porn film and even just for your own benefit, you could have it for yourself as long as you're filming. Right. That's hilarious. It's so stupid. But yeah, I love the way. Oh, but it's brain work, but he's not the only one that stopped that. I'm sure. I'm sure. But it's still, the porn loophole is how, um, like porn stars get away with doing quote unquote prostitution like that. There was a girl that was at the comedy store and she was telling guys that you could fuck her, but you have to pay her her rate and you have to turn a camera on. Yep. And she's like, I'm not a hooker. I'm like, okay. I don't even know what to say. I gotta go.

Speaker 4:          01:10:07       I don't know. I would have entertained that cover sick before ally. Yeah. It was getting ugly. It was getting. I think she had this dude with her. I'm like, how does he fit? Yeah, that pitch. Well, he was like, I didn't know if he was the boyfriend or if he's the pimp, but he was right. He didn't. I mean, unless he had a gun, I don't know how he's going to protect her. It was very strange. But that's the comedy store. How many stores have vortex of strange somehow or another, it just drags those people to that one place that I sat in the rainbow. You ever go to the rainbow bar and grill as the place where they. When Lemmy died from motorhead, they saved a seat for him. Oh, I'll have a seat that's permanently reserved and I'm like, yeah, it's permanently reserved.

Speaker 4:          01:10:48       I like it a place to. Let me see. Yeah, they have candles there and shit. Like maybe if one of his band members comes there and they're all sold out, they'll let them sit there. Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe you have to be like Lenny's friends if friends and they want to sit at a table. I think that's, that should fly. That's okay. You know, I think I can see a different factual is going to war over it. He's like, nope, this is for Lamean. Motherfucker can all do it. And the other guys being like, yes, this friends. Come on, you can do it. Yeah. Yeah. That's, I would religious warfare begins. That is. Yeah, right. Like sacred. Anything sacred, sacred grounds, sacred places. Sacred. The word. Just this sacred things. There's good and bad in them. There's like, there's, there's definitely merit in sacred things, but you know, like there's an area in Hawaii where the Keck observatory is and they wanted to construct a larger, bigger telescope and apparently they have problems because the native American, I guess I native American Hawaiian, they're sort of native Americans, Hawaiians, um, the people that lived there have some sacred ground up there that they don't think that you're supposed to build on, which, you know, I get it.

Speaker 4:          01:12:04       It's their spot, you know, false on some assholes come up there with a telescope. Yep. I got that. Have you ever been up there to the Keck observatory? Not that I want. You have been to the big island a no. Be normally to Maui big island is awesome. It's so strange because it's the biggest of the islands, but it's the least populated of the Hawaiian islands duct. It's, and it's also one where it has all these different ecosystems on one island, like if you go like near the Hilo side where Bj Penn's from, it's all like tropical beautiful God. It rains all the time and it's lush and green. It's magical. But then you go to like the other side, like the Kona side and it's like, it's totally different. It's drier and then there's areas that have these giant lava beds and it's up to the tape to hold the whole place is amazing.

Speaker 4:          01:12:54       Even seemed the lava beds. Yeah, I've seen. I've seen some pretty crazy shit on the whole. I don't know why he's one with this place. This is kind of a nice steady. That is even part of the US because he's going to be the love, the fucking pissing people off anything. But it's a beautiful place. I can see how you want to. Well, how about Alaska? You have to fly through Canada gets elected. It was bizarre. Except frozen Puerto Rico. Yeah. It doesn't make any sense. That's the APP right there. The I'm nobody to think you are saying about the sake of it. And to me it seemed interesting because precisely because you hold something sacred to me. You need to be able to have more to laugh to not because you diminish its importance. He dirt to avoid fucking up and throw an 18 to a dogma.

Speaker 4:          01:13:38       You know the one theme that keeps things loose like you speaking of American Indian stuff is bad twat at the. I remember being like at some Lakota ceremonies wedding, was he liar. He was to see people who have grown app with dates so far damaged that he other thing versus like some white guys were coming up and then they will find out about. He supposed to be right as he ladders. That was during the break of the ceremony. They were giving some of the Sunday and of giving bikes to settle with the people we're supporting their right and these guys were taking the pipe. They will smoke it, they will pass it to other people and they gave it to this white lady was clearly

Speaker 3:          01:14:11       ticket ourselves real seriously. Right. And so she's tried to like the five but she can that she feels she failed. So she thrived and then taking herself superseded he or she takes a deep breath and she goes, oh, the spirit's the one metal light this pipe today. And there was a lady next to her was trying to not die laughing, but she was trying to be polite, right? But she was like, look, it's a windy day just to be okay for the whole Lakota lady. The spirits of the love that is precisely because it's real. You can call when sometimes the spirits are trying to tell you just to relax a little bit lighter up. Yeah. It's like someone saying to you in the master chief in most people who say, no master are assholes. I don't mean that. They're mean people around me. They're assholes like me, but you just shut the fuck up bitch.

Speaker 3:          01:15:10       You know, come on man. You don't really mean that. You're just trying to be like super spiritual. But I swear to God, like there's Yoga teachers that can say it after a yoga class and you'll say it back and you mean it because you just did 90 minutes of hell together and you'll, you'll say it and mean it. But that's a tricky thing that sometime that the guy was there, yellow deal and the guy was the thought Elforni can sound exactly the same except that one is three. I don't want like, to me like a lot of these six about spirituality, they don't make me throw up or because they are so cheesy, so made apps or fig. But then there are the moments where you go, oh shit, that was it. Like the other day Mandy's was three p like this guy I'm from Canada, emailed me and he's like, oh, we had this, it was a Lakota thing, right?

Speaker 3:          01:15:57       American Indian stuff. And he was like, we had a ceremony and uh, was um, we parade also for your daughter and blah blah blah. And I'm like, okay, thanks. That's sweet. And the guy goes, oh, by the way, I kind of have the feeling that she may be sensitive to things like the task or if by any chance she had a dream of having to do with American Indians. And I'm like, that's fucking weird because she doesn't remember the dreams nine nights out of 10. And you know, Indian, she never mentioned that one, so there's no right. But I figured out it doesn't matter to us so I try not to ask a leading question. So I just asked her, hey, did you have any dream last night? And she goes, no, and I was like, you have say bullshit, whatever. And then she goes, no, no, wait, wait, wait.

Speaker 3:          01:16:34       I had a dream, like my grandpa was taking me to this place where they were Indians and they taught me to speak Lakota and yeah, we had a good time. And I went like, and I don't run with it, you know, I don't say, oh, it's because of this period, this I have no fucking idea. Right. I'm just reporting what happens. But when you look at it, you go like, Oh shit. Maybe the universities a lot weirder than we assume sometimes the problem with something like that as you can't measure it, of course you can't. There's no way. Whenever anybody has a clairvoyant moment or a moment where they kind of have

Speaker 4:          01:17:10       an instinct that doesn't seem to make any sense but turns out to be true. And they go, well, what was that? Was it coincidental? Like what was that? And you know, there's like some Sam Harris type people that are like very straightforward, rational thinking. They'll, they'll, they'll sort of boil it down to coincidence and I'm not entirely convinced I like Sam and I don't mean to talk shit about it because I like him and I did stuff, but I think that's complete bullshit to me or a fundamentalist as much as the religious fundamentalists like the going so badly to explain every single tool whether you're explaining the as in it's because God the dds or because no, it's because he must be a coincidence because the probability of these, that it's like that can you just doesn't meet the life is weird and we don't have all the explanations and leave it at that time.

Speaker 4:          01:17:59       He's right most of the time. No. See, I think there's a lot of people that try to make things sound spiritual and connect circumstances and say, you know, it's fate and it's, you know, it's a psychic moment when really it's just total coincidence. There is a lot of that. A lot though is not everything, it's not everything, but it's hard to differentiate like what is like you wouldn't you talk to a guy and he says that your daughter had some sort of a dream about native Americans financially. She's sensitive and then you asked her and she said, Oh yeah, I had a dream about native Americans. Like the fuck. What are the odds? Most kids you. Yeah, I had a dream. I was on the my little pony store. I had all the money in the world that night. Like literally what the fuck are y'all?

Speaker 4:          01:18:45       It's right. And he's like, what are the odds of the Sheila remember anything? What are the odds that you'd have to do with the topic that she never mentioned once in our life? Science, you ever have a dream about someone, then you get an email from them the next day and you haven't talked to them in years ago too. I don't. I don't necessarily believe that the only connections that people have to each other a physical, like you have to be there and see each other. They're there very well. Might be some sort of a, a dream state connection or a thought connection that we just can't. We can't put on a scale that we can't like take a ruler and go, oh, this is a seven inches long. You can't, we can't measure it. I said I've had enough of those experiences. And again, not to believe because I don't know what I believe.

Speaker 4:          01:19:25       Right. I have no fucking idea. I don't know how the universe works, but do we have enough experiences that. Let me think. There's no way to dcs that Queens student's thesis at Queens. It didn't do. And Stephanie single time that he just leaves me with kind of my mind is open to possibilities. I don't know what's out there. There's stuff that I experienced there. Stuff that I don't experience. I have zero beliefs about the nature of reality because my tools are very limited about what I understand. But that had been enough of those cases where you go, oh shit, that was a coincidence. I was maybe 18 or something. They had, um, went to hiking with my friends, go off into my own thing, and we go back, which was great because I was alone with this two hot women. The other guy was with going off. I'm

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       like, fuck you, plea of disappear somewhere and enjoy a day. Should have this too hot. We went for the rest of the day. This is as good as it gets. And like at one point I literally, it's like somebody, like a phone rang where I got up and I'm like, fuck, there's up at all these duties have been a problem right now. And there's really no reason to think. He said he'd be back four hours later, an hour had gone by. There's no reason whatsoever to feel that way. And that's what I tell myself. He's like, that's bullshit. Why are you making what kind of a bullshit excuse not to deal with the women? That's beautiful. You know, stay. Yeah. What are you? And I try, I try. I keep getting in my head that I was like, no, there's a fucking big problem in. You may not be a bad idea to pay attention to it, and I'm like, Jesus Christ here ruin my day.

Speaker 3:          01:20:53       Even when you're not here. Fuck you. I don't like it. But I'm like, okay, this is bugging me. I'm fine. I'll walk up. I'll start going up the mountain and see what the hell. Like none of this makes sense. Going up the mountain, there's 15 different paths that you can take to go up to the mountain. I don't know which one I can take a stab and just pick one because I don't know what else to do and I keep going and I'm a year these voice called limit. So I called back and eventually a year did my friend's voice calling again. I find him, the dude got dehydrated. I'd gone up too fast too. And it was done right. He had no energy left. He was on the floor. Just collapse them. Pussies. You're hanging around with what? Him and a peak hour? No, no, no, it was.

Speaker 3:          01:21:39       He said he was going to be back at a tie, but he had been there longer, but I don't know. He said it because I don't like him anymore, so I'm all good with that. I liked your trx like, fuck you. I have a little problem with that, but that's the universe universe. One of them to dietary should've left bang those church. That's like one of my deepest regrets. A skull and use it as a candle holder. Exactly like that. But you know it doesn't love it. You're like, why did I have that thought? Why? You have to carry them down. Yeah. I carried him down. Yeah, it was a painting done. Now I just better get up to starting now. Pissed off. No Wiemann. Save this asshole. Or would the girls do this whole back there eating each other out? Yeah, they were right. When they're done coming.

Speaker 3:          01:22:22       They had this attitude which was like, really? You want to go? Okay, your loss at my doing this. Will you at least a hero when they found out that the guy was sure a great. I was a hero. Who Cares for the people listening is making the hand job gesture. That's just not up at all the. Yeah. I wonder what that is. Maybe you just didn't have any faith in your friend. You knew he was kind of an idiot. He, uh, I don't know, man. I don't know. It could be. I'm not saying that like the dream thing from last night, that was even weirder. Ds One. I can see how it could be something goes right. Or if I was Sam Harris, I'd say, well, let's just think for a moment. The possibilities, right? Yeah. I don't, I just, I don't

Speaker 4:          01:23:06       think that he's necessarily completely averse to the idea of there being some sort of connection. I think he and like you and I agree, most of that stuff is like the lady that says the spirits don't want me to let the cycle. Yeah. Most of it's bullshit. I agree completely, man. I'll tell you one thing. It changed my perception on, on just the supernatural and the spiritual is looking into it. When I did that Saifai show and when I did a, I did a show called Joe Rogan questions, not Joe Rogan questions. Everything I'm a game show in my head and the game showing my head show was a hidden camera show or the people had like an earpiece in and we would tell them to go do things and we set this one up in Hollywood and you know, they would have a game show like here's your task.

Speaker 4:          01:23:49       This is what you have to do. And one of the things they had to do was we told them that your reporter for a local television station, you're doing the news and you're reporting on a Ufo sighting. You have to find someone and tell them, listen, I had a witness. They were here for this Ufo story. We have the cameras here, but they took off. Well, are you willing to say that you saw the Ufo to wow and fucking everyone said yes. They just went right? Not only did they say yes, they went right into these elaborate fake stories on camera and I went, wow. It was such an eyeopener for me and I was like, how many of those people that you see in those Ufo documentaries? Like the famous one was the phoenix lights, use the phoenix. The Phoenix lights was a, uh, a series of sightings that happened in Phoenix, I want to say in the early nineties maybe.

Speaker 4:          01:24:43       And uh, it was very controversial because the governor, uh, was, was saying he was going to get to the bottom of this, this is all like, this is a very controversial. And then he held a press conference and made a mockery out of it by having someone, a dress up like an alien and say we found the culprit and here he is. The guy comes out, he's got an alien costume on. And the UFL believers were really pissed off because they were like, fuck you. I saw something. There was a triangle shaped object the size of a football field. It was flying overhead. It wasn't making any noise. Like all these people had these, all these things that they said that they saw, but there's almost no evidence is only evidence of these lights that are floating in the sky that they think where there's the governor, Arizona Governor and the fucking alien.

Speaker 4:          01:25:29       So hilarious. But what people were saying that they saw there was, there was one, there was one explanation that made sense and that was they were flares, that the government had a let loose with parachutes and they were drifting down from the sky slowly and they fell behind the mountain ranges and that's why they disappeared. Like if you look at the actual video that, that people did get there just lights that are hovering in the sky. It doesn't. There's no triangle shaped black objects that are flying around. But everybody had all these. It's soon as soon as you start saying, hey, there's a phoenix lights and people saw you have for me too, man. I saw it. I was on my porch was strange that night was electric. I felt it in the air and I agree with you if they'd like. To me 99 percent of the stories are such bullshit, but to ease.

Speaker 4:          01:26:18       Like sometime there are some that you can't explain, which doesn't mean it's real. It doesn't mean we know why your. Yes it was a euphoria was anything goes or he was that. Yeah, there was something that came into somebodies dream. Who knows, right. I have no idea, but why the hell are we trying to explain it that way? Every single time, you know, sometime just saved. There is no explanation why. Who knows why that's a hey, that's weird to leave it at that. You don't have to run with it, but you don't have to deny it either. You know, you know what's amazing man? Go shows. What's that good? Those ghost shows. Ghost hunter shows. Oh yeah, there was fucking years and all those episodes and those motherfuckers got nothing. It's faithful. Let's see what comes after the commercial break. I. That was the bass player tape recorder.

Speaker 4:          01:27:02       Listened. Listened to. Very clear. Did you hear that clearly? Clearly what he was saying. Yeah, those are the best. Yeah. Well know what the fuck that is. There's so much shenanigans and fuckery going on. No shows. Wasn't there like a fucking murder recently? Like a, a, a ghost hunter, like killed his wife and killed himself or something like that. Yeah, something like that. Like a famous one, right? On television or something like that. Yeah. What Dow Jamie and find it, but yeah, that and um, those mediums like the long island psychic, the fuck Outta here. And I think finding a problem that, that word is so many charlatans that is not even fun. Couple appear featured on ghost adventures, dead and apparent murder. Suicide. Damn. Who self styled paranormal investigators. Yeah. They don't give a fucking degree for that paranormal investigation. Mark and Debbie Constantinos says m and a third still unidentified man were killed yesterday in sparks, Nevada.

Speaker 4:          01:28:07       That's where it goes down on a domestic violence incident. Turned deadly. That constantino's killed themselves. What? Build themselves as electronic script make that larger looked elect as electronic voice phenomenon experts and made frequent appearances on reality shows about the supernatural, most notably occurring on travel channel's ghost adventures. Oh, the couple were a strange. Oh, okay. She found him with a new dude or she or he found her rather with the new dude. He killed them both and killed themselves. Debbie Constantinos had been living with two roommates, approximately 8:00 AM. Tuesday. The police were called department after one of her roommates found their male roommate dead. And Debbie missing. Yup, that's it. Police eventually discovered that she was being held hostage by Mark Constantino and apartment belonged to one of the couples. Adult children attempts to negotiate failed around 1:30 PM. A Swat team breached the apartment door and found both people did Jesus Christ heavy.

Speaker 4:          01:29:11       Oh, can I can't compute. Why can't people just break up? Yeah, see it. He's like, what the fuck? Like murder suicide. When people break up like God damn you pussy you fucking pussy. You can't handle her. Finding a new person. God. People are so weak in that regard. That is one of the weaker aspects of humanity is the inability to accept that someone doesn't want to fuck you anymore. She knew Dick let her go. She's still, she's still got some life left dinner, but the thing you are 17, you should be over that. He's like, you deal with it the first time. So brutal. I don't even dig. Like when people flip out about access, you know he's almost a stereotype. I everybody thought about their ex. No motherfucker. You borrowed them into your life. You are the one who like if you didn't see it, worry about what's going on with you.

Speaker 4:          01:29:59       If they were really that bad, if they were such horrible human beings and yard, a wine opener with that mean or maybe they are not a fucking bad and you're just blowing it out over a bar from [inaudible] they are meeting and you can deal with the fact that they are with somebody else. He's like, there's, there's definitely that. Well, there's definitely some people that got fucked over like divorces were dudes have to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for the rest of their life, but even that to me is interesting because it's like, no, it's not easy, but it's, it's the same woman that you built in your life and you need to fucking see that she was capable of that. You know what I mean? So yes, why she's the scum of the earth and you can and should be a piece with her. I would also reserve a little bit for your own judgment of how you open the door to this lady and the problem is that there's a legal option.

Speaker 4:          01:30:41       It's not that she's a scum of the earth. The problem is you are breaking up. She does feel pain. When I'm not saying, I'm not saying that you shouldn't feel pain when someone wants to fuck someone else because you're going to. It's just, it's going to happen. You're going to feel terrible. You're going to feel jealousy, you're going to feel sadness, you're going to feel lost. It's going to happen, but what I'm saying is you have to have some fucking perspective. All right? You are a human being and if you're here in America, you live in the best place on the planet in 2016, which is the best time ever to be alive and you fucking pussy. You can't. You got match.com. You Got Tinder, get to crack and baby start slinging Dick. You Know You could sling Dick Today like you could sling vagina. You can.

Speaker 4:          01:31:21       You can do whatever you want to do today. This is a different world like move on. You'll find someone that you don't want to not be with or that you do want to be with it. You can get along with work on yourself, like figure it out, man. Don't go on a murder. Suicide rampage. I know, but this woman, like I have a friend who was. I've told, talked about him before he, he was divorced and the divorce was brutal. It took forever. She went to all the other lawyers in town so that he couldn't go to them because she had context. Yeah. She had contacted them first, like it's just a brutal, brutal shit. And she tortured him for like two years, like changing the terms of the divorce re going back. All the while he's paying for her lawyer. Hey, she's paying for his lawyer.

Speaker 4:          01:32:05       He's paying for everything. She was trying to bleed them out. Then she got this ridiculous settlement and she got his house, massive beautiful fucking house overlooking the ocean like the whole deal. And on top of that, because they were married for 12 years, he has to pay her for the rest of her life. So he's paying. He's paying her hundreds of thousands of dollars every year for the rest of her life. And that's not it. I mean, you could say, well, hey, he should have known he let that person to his life, but he used to love her, but she, in that time of loss and pain and suffering, she had a legal option and the lawyer came to her and said, listen to your, your, um, you helped him write you. You helped to make me wild. She didn't do shit. She walked around fucking beverly hills with a little tiny dog though him and got her nails done and got her fucking pedicure done and talked a lot of shit about him while he was at work.

Speaker 4:          01:32:53       And that guy busted his ass all day long. But because that was his quote unquote wife, because they scribbled their name on some paper and said, I do that guys fucked for the rest of his life. That I. I mean, I see it a point to, don't get me wrong. There are other cases where the axes, the evil demon from hell, I get that, but a steel wild. It's their full that is not yours. Steel Yard Awano didn't see that. They were a demo from highland middle domain and too old, so he is yet a sock now. What? I think they suck. She's got nothing going on and this is there. To her. It's like, what is she gonna do she gonna work all day and take some job? That sucks. She's in her late forties, early fifties now. She's an older lady. She's not. She doesn't have the best health.

Speaker 4:          01:33:38       Like what is she going to do? She's just going to keep taking hundreds of thousands of dollars every year because the law says it's okay. Well, I think that there's a lot of like those are pretty dramatic extremes. There's like, I'm never going to take a banyan. I got to go back to work 10 hours a day. Says that or says that they never passed that my point. Right. But the other one is also Yara. NASA is not just each day or is an option is you choose an option that's designed to bleed. The other person that I. When you know it's not right. Well, he makes good money so it's not like he's been getting bullied, bled dry, but he has to pay an exorbitant amount of money every year to a person that he doesn't fuck anymore and now he has a wife and he has children. He has a whole new family and still a giant chunk of his income goes to this lady that he doesn't have anything to do with anymore and it will to the day she dies.

Speaker 4:          01:34:27       So she lives to be 500 years old because of modern science. Fucking dude is paying her for the next 400 years. Yeah, but it's. Yeah, that makes you think twice about. It's incredible. It's stupid and I'm married and I'm happy. I'll tell you right now, I'm a happily married person. I love my wife. I love having a family. It's nice for me. It works, but it's stupid. Like the contract is dumb. It's a dumb legal contract and it's. It's an archaic one and I can understand a child support. I can understand all that stuff. I understand all that, but what drives me crazy is this idea that in my friend's case, somehow or another, because he lived with her for 12 years, by the way, it was more than 12 years ago that they separate it, so let's think of that so it, but because he lived with her for 12 years, he has somehow or another fucked her to the point where she can't work anymore.

Speaker 4:          01:35:23       He gave her so much dick during the time we're together. She just discombobulated. She can't fill out a form if you have a child. Okay. When the child turns 18, you're no longer legally responsible. That's an adult. They're gone. If you have child support, you don't have to pay it after 18. When they become 18, that's your. You have to get a job kid. You have to figure out a way to feed yourself. It's part of the growth of life, not when you're a grown woman and when you're a grown woman and she was in her forties when they broke up and for whatever fucking reason. We have these wacky laws that state that this person doesn't have to work again forever. No children by the way. No children. That's cool. They never had kids together. What is it? These 12. The magic number is like if it was 11 then.

Speaker 4:          01:36:03       Oh fuck it. You don't have to it like, I don't know. I think, I think it varies, but I think in California for whatever reason, it was 12. You know, I think 10 is a big one, like 10 years is the big one. So it might've been that it was 10 because a Ralphie may just got, just got jacked. Apparently his, uh, his woman just divorced him after 10 and that same number 10 and at 10 the party begins. So if you are thinking about it, now is the time to call it. It's hard to imagine someone not being in your life, but yet you have to pay the money. Yeah. That's fucked up. And they're just no way around it. But in his case, like his wife has children or his ex wife now has children from him and so he is definitely financial responsible for her children, his children, their, their, you know, their children and I think he should pay alimony because she has to take care of those kids and she can't really work.

Speaker 4:          01:37:02       Like, you know, she's not like a free person who's single, but if you're a free person that's single, I can understand you needing a couple of years to get on your feet. That's fair. That's what I mean about the grades is like one is one extreme, one is you get nothing years. Fair enough. I mean if you say if you live with a woman and for 10 years you're married and for 10 years she doesn't have to work because you're some fucking diamond merchant downtown la or something like that. And you break up with her and then you know, you got a house, bitch, you're on your own. She doesn't have any skills or anything like that's fucked up. Capital fierce. These fierce, fair. Something like that is a reasonable compromise. But there's this weird thing that they do where it's called the quality of life.

Speaker 4:          01:37:42       You're supposed to maintain the same quality of life. Like what? Yeah, that's bullshit. So if you're living with like coby Bryant, like coby Brian's wife, like she's responsible for his children. So she should certainly get money and. But how much money man, how, how does she get hundreds of millions of dollars. Like how does that work? You know, forever. Forever. Yeah. That's nuts to the end of time. Till till the day they die. And if you don't have a Prenup, get ugly. So. Yup. And he's like, no, it prenup is not real bad. Like fuck you. This is a construct. Anyway, the whole thing is a colon threat with a volts the states. And if you don't have a Prenup, believe me, those conversations get way more intense when things get ugly. When a woman knows there's no prenup involved. Yeah. Yeah. Like I have a buddy who doesn't have a prenup and him and his wife are fighting and I go, do you have a prenup?

Speaker 4:          01:38:30       You know, how dare you could say we were having a conversation about. He's like, oh, I couldn't figure out a way to like justify having a prenup. I go, here's a way. If you were in love and you're married together and you're going to be together forever, the Prenup doesn't mean shit, but it doesn't mean anything. If you really plan on being together forever, but have that person wants to fucking abandoned ship than drain you like a fucking plug at the bottom of a bathtub will will, will, will blow, will bump. That's when you need a prenup. Because if you're gonna break up, that's an a prenup comes into play and then you need it and you should have it right, but if you're going to be together forever, the Prenup doesn't mean a goddamn thing because you're going to be together forever, so don't worry about it.

Speaker 4:          01:39:17       Get a fucking prenup. Silly Bitch. It only. It only becomes a factor if you get divorced. That's why any woman that says he wants to have a peanut, you don't think it's gonna last? No, I think it is going to last, but it's. It doesn't this fucking. The logic of not having a prenup is insane. If we break up, I want to get financially fucked. That's how much I love you so much. I want to stay together. I want to stay together with you under the threat of being financially ruined because otherwise it's now through love. No, it's fucking chick said to me. The date was hilarious. She goes, well, I'll tell you what. More and more women today are paying alimony. I go name one. It's like silence. Roseanne Barr, that's all they say. Roseanne Barr.

Speaker 4:          01:40:07       Tom Arnold. Tom Arnold. Okay. We got one under our belt. That's one victory as opposed to a what? What? Hundreds of millions of guys that have been fucked over by the system. Yeah. I don't get. I actually don't even get the huddle idea of marriage and I don't mean like committed relationship. I got that. I got a little that about why the fuck do you need to bring into state and low years because it's a business. That's what I mean is like if it said a nature of shape, why do you need to all this shit in? Well, it's a business in terms of like there's a business of the diamonds, you know, is three months to add too much to ask like those fucking diamond merchants. Fuck, I'm bringing them up again on a wire. But, but diamonds, the idea that three months salary, three months, that is a fucking

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       crazy for guy has to work three months out of a whole year for a little rock that goes around your finger just to show you. You have too much to ask. That would be a deal breaker right off the bat. He's like, what you first of all fucking month, what you want the. We're all going to cost thousands of dollars. Fuck off. I just have nothing in common with you. I'm done. Most people don't have enough money to get by period like there scraped, but most people are going pretty much checked the channel. They have like, you know, a little bit of money in the bank case fucking shit goes terribly wrong, but they don't have three months worth of money in the bank. So what are you going to do for three months? I'm going to suffer so that you could have a rock on your finger.

Speaker 2:          01:41:35       What am I gonna do? I'm gonna eat potato chips for lunch and fucking starve to death. Ramen noodles at dinner every night. Whoa. Save 20 books to go through the jaw. So it goes into the diamond jor now. But that to me is the ultimate bullshit. He's like, do people actually fucking like diamonds is not a status symbol nights come on. He's like, you fucking fake thing that looks exactly the same. And you, unless you were a jeweler with them, but it's not the same. But that's what I mean. He's like, it's about it costs a shitload of money is a symbol is not the yellow thing. It's like, what can you do with three months salary? You can do so much fucking good stuff. How about we do that? So celebrate the wedding or whatever to hell, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Give me the rock.

Speaker 2:          01:42:22       My aunt got fucked over the. She uh, she married this guy. He was real shady. He was always shady, like from the beginning. And she had a nice wedding ring. Nice fat rock. When they got divorced she went and go, checked out. Cubic Zirconia. Ah, that's the way you have to do it. Yup. She fucked him over. He, he got her a fake rock. That's the way to do it. They look so real, man. It's hard to tell. I guess a diamond merchant can tell like that, but not a fucking dynamometor trends. So how about we don't deal with that. We know. It's not like having a fake Ferrari. Yeah. You know, like a fake Ferrari will drive like shit. Exactly. That there's something good. Yelled, yelled the diamonds and there's nothing so crazy. I know a lady who's a billionaire, uh, her and her husband, her husband's is very, very wealthy tycoon type character.

Speaker 2:          01:43:10       He's kind of hilarious. He dresses like sergeant pepper's lonely hearts club band and it was like those little outfits on throws these magical parties in Malibu or just fucking huge, huge, crazy parties would probably cross like a million bucks. The guy's an animal, but he got her to this rock that I don't know enough about diamonds to say how much it cost, but it's well over a million dollars. Well, it's huge. I mean it's fucking. It's like a watch. It's a flavor. Flave watch. Hang it. It's like our clock on her finger. It's so big. What is this? Was this a new guy? She's with? This just came out of this weekend. Thirty five carat diamond ring that makes. Who is this dude? She's with some billionaire from Australia. Will look at him. Let me see what he looks like. Yeah, that looks like you need a 35 to get 50. 40th five. Thirty five it says. Yeah. She's still hot. Yeah. How's that ass look big, right? Big Juicy Papao. Look at that ring. She was like much smaller and thinner when she was younger. Huh? Not that I liked that. That's 35 carrots. That's what that is. I was expecting bigger. I don't mean. I don't know. I was too. I'm telling you that the lady that I know her ring is bigger than that.

Speaker 2:          01:44:23       Yeah. That shit makes me like, how much does that cost projectile vomiting? Just looking at this. Yeah, that's probably, that's probably a million bucks.

Speaker 2:          01:44:34       This is a lot like you remember when j Lo and Ben Affleck were a character? They were. There were one we ever a great story. Great Story. I know a dude who's a construction guy and uh, he uh, was dealing with them at the time and uh, allegedly the story is, uh, the J lo. Ben Affleck had like a full 10, a basketball court that he had at his place. She wanted to take the basketball court apart and put it in her house. I guess it's a surprise to surprise him. And the guy's like, what? No, I'm not doing that.

Speaker 2:          01:45:18       Pokes you imagine what kind of fucking craziness that bitch has in her head. She's like, I'm just going to move his favorite place to my place. That way when he has his basketball games, you'll have to have it at my house. Like what? Like she, she wanted to move it, like take it, put it, I want it. It's mine. He's mine. A basketball court in my house. I like the Bursa nation. Oh my God. People do some crazy shit to get into relationships. I mean, he's like poutine APP with people request to Jesse because he's like, fuck that. I don't need it that bad. I don't know man. I don't get it. It's never call friend and his wife answers his cell phone. It. No, I'm missing out on that experience. You've got a lot that happened more than once and I'd lose all respect for that guy unless he's in the middle of fucking, uh, holding up a pan of hot oil that he's carrying the stove or something and it's an emergency phone call or something. I mean, why the fuck would your wife answer your cell phone? I think that's an accusatory way. Hello? Who is it? This is Joe's. Dave there. Joe. Who? Joe Rogan. Hold on. Hey Dave. Why is your fucking wife answering your phone? Like, um, some chick who was calling or a gay lover? He fucking Weirdo. Will you keep your phone in your pocket? Bitch? Don't let her have it. Not that I think that's like our security daylight. There is like Ken Score,

Speaker 3:          01:46:50       a hot woman, so if I cannot underscore one, I'm just going to hold onto her. No Metro batshit crazy. She Gans I'm going to put up with anything because I'm afraid to be alone. That I think is speaking of the book stuff. That's another thing that I noticed changing in me.

Speaker 3:          01:47:06       It's for the longest time I had these exact dynamics that I'm criticizing. I had that made me right. That was like, I don't want to be alone. If I'm a woman I want to stick to her and she does some crazy shit. That's totally fine. It's like that's fear. That's insecurity. That's if I let her go, I'll never get laid with the hottest woman again kind of thing. And at one point I think is like I had dealt with an app shade that something's not me where I was just like, you know what? From now on, and I don't even mean that in a bad way. I don't fuck. You want to make one compromise in my life if I have to be anything gathered and why am 24 slash seven? I don't want to be with you. You may be a nice person. I'm not criticizing you, but I don't want you in my life. Right?

Speaker 2:          01:47:45       But what if you smoke a joint with her and she throws that Posi around like fucking John Elway, just with the, the long yards. Woo God damn walk. Like when elway wax that ball, that helps for those two hours. But then there's the rest of your life. So those two, our sort of good eight. Now let's move on to something, but then when you're at work thinking about those two hours, you know, loosen up the God damn it. You know what I'm saying? Now I'm going for a layup. Flying from the three point line right through the net. This bitches hot. Yup. Yup. Then you now if you break up with that phone is just ringing off the hook from dudes trying to get ahold of that Voodoo Pussy. Right? What are you going to do now? You're going to be cool and calm and collected. You got to try because he fucks up the rest of your life or does even if he was every single day, that is the most magical sex in the ward for the two hours that you spend.

Speaker 2:          01:48:44       There are 22 more hours. Just sleep a lot that it's all okay. Right? Then you can put up with a thought. It's solo artist. I know this dude who to, who was a mobster and talked about going to jail, going to jail was no big deal. The key was you got to sleep your time away. We'd sleep like 18 hours a day. That works. And I was like, really? Like, yeah, that's you gotta do just sleep with time away. A lot of people are up to doing pushups now me, I sleep my time away. By the time, you know, two years is gone, nothing. I slept, I got arrested. Okay. Eighteen hours a day. Jesus, he's an asshole. What are you going to do? Yeah. But um, yeah, there's some, some girls are just so hot and then it's also like there's something else that's going on. Love is real and emotions are real and appreciating someone is real and there's definitely that, but there's also some biological tricks that go on when you connect with someone and you have sex with them. There's like some weird sort of possessive tricks where your DNA doesn't want them to be with

Speaker 4:          01:49:48       anyone else because your DNA wants to procreate with them and that's where you have to protect this. This one person who you're shooting loads into who you're going to have babies with. Where'd you go? What are you talking to? That guy I saw the way that guy hugged you, like all this craziness that comes about you, you, you, that person becomes you. They become your property, but you can't control them. And then if they're freaky, if they're crazy freaky bitches, you got to go this crazy freaky bitches. Probably crazy with other dudes too. And then she's probably been crazy freaky bitch with other dudes before me. So now I have to think that those dudes know that she's slinging that fucking superstitious stitious pussy out there. What I think anybody ever in the history of mankind use of still arts together. That's, that's first, she's got some fucking Voodoo Posey.

Speaker 4:          01:50:34       She's got some supernatural pussy. There's people that can do things better and includes fucking, you know, like everybody. I have you dated a girl who was really hot but just terrible. Terrible in bed. No, I miss out on that experience. I went on a couple of them, but I had one of them. I was like, I gotta stop with your Skus. Stopped doing really bad. Yeah, she's just a for all sorts of reasons. I guess like maybe it wasn't her fault. Maybe she was just like insecure or uncomfortable or unaware or, you know, it turned out later on that I found the shed like a coke problem that I, I wasn't aware of that would, that I've never done it. But apparently that just blocks you off from like emotional. What of it is that, what made it bad side? We just, it wasn't good.

Speaker 4:          01:51:18       You know, it's like the girl that I dated before her was a freak, so I was like, oh my God are lowering sucks. It's not fun. Yeah. Yeah. It's like when, when someone's just, when they're all in, you know, and then the next girl is not all in you like kind flying someone was all in my head a gamble for the next one. I'm not here to pay play penny slots. I'm here to push a fucking mortgage into the center of the table and go, what are we doing there? That's where the excitement is, right? What do you make of Australia and ability to instead turn off. The second thing you are talking about sort of that DNA like your mind and you know, the possessiveness, the jealousy, all of that. The whole uh, Chris Ryan ability. What do you mean? Well, you know, he sold it to theory about just fucking monogamy.

Speaker 4:          01:52:01       It's all about happy monkeys having sex with each other and just let it be. Well, I think that's something that you can learn. Yeah, I think it's really when you boil down to what it really is, when you boil it down to, you know, if you can be objective about if it's at all possible, it's a pleasure. Like why is, why should you be the only person that can give that person pleasure? Why should that person be the only place where you get pleasure? Are we slaves to these ancient emotions and ancient connections that we have to other human beings that were really based on scarcity? I think whenever things are based on scarcity, you know the idea that you'll be alone if you don't want. I've heard she, I'll be with them. It's like famine thinking. If that means if I don't eat this meal hills, we do more meals.

Speaker 4:          01:52:50       Does that fam and thinking when it comes to friends, like if you ever have a friend, like what were you hanging out with them for where you fucking even hang out with me anymore. That's the surest way to lose a friend. Upset. What could become like really needy, where you'd get upset that that friend hangs out with other friends. That's ridiculous. It's crazy. People like that are ridiculous and I've had friends like that before and they get it when, you know, only when I was younger. When you know, when you're younger you're sort of figuring out what style of person you are and how do you live your life and what's acceptable and what's not acceptable and you know, the people that are like that, whether they're aware or not, they're just incredibly manipulative. They might not even be aware of why or what they're doing, but when it comes to relationships, a lot of times people also mirror the family that they grew up in.

Speaker 4:          01:53:36       Like if you grew up in a really jealous, really abusive family, sure you can, you can, it can mirror itself, you know, mirror itself and you or it can be the exact opposite where you see how retarded your parents were and you're like, well fuck that. I'm not going to be like that anymore. So I think Chris is obviously a very brilliant guy and a Chris Ryan's book. It's an excellent book, which is, you know, really highly respected. I think he's got some real good points and if you can intellectualize it and be objective. Yeah. You know, if you, if you're happy living that life and he's happy, you know, and he knows a lot of people that also live like that are happening. It's nothing wrong with it. No, exactly. I mean I, to me, the, the, I recommend he lays out. Makes perfect sense.

Speaker 4:          01:54:21       I think he's right. He's just a. for a lot of people it's hard tool. Got Overdose. They still are possessive and jealous and don't have that and they can deal with the idea that somebody's date law. He's supposed to be all me. Fuck. Nice. You can't have sex with somebody else. They flip out. But yeah, with. To me when you think about it doesn't really make sense. Well, you know, what else does it make sense? Monogamy doesn't make sense, but neither does polygamy. It [inaudible] make sense? You should do whatever you want. Right? Like what if you're in monogamy monogamy's great. That's what I mean. Exactly. If you work for you, why should ensure way. It doesn't work with everyone. If you find one person and it doesn't work with them, then that's not the one you should be monogamous with. But it doesn't mean that you can't be monogamous with somebody else or maybe even that same person in another stage of your life.

Speaker 4:          01:55:10       You know, sometimes things change. I get a chance. To me, the idea idea is the one that makes the most sense and all philosophical. But every single dive, try to throw it out there at the lady I wanted to get into a relationship with the discussion. Was he variably it makes sense. Your Pauline's bots can. Nope, sorry. It's not going to go. And then it's a choice, right? He's like, do I want it anyway? Giving these fetal is off. He called it sound cooler or not. And the times when I have gone for eight, 10. So he was dead in monogamous relationship. That's totally with it. You know, it wasn't

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       like, oh, I spend my days thinking about what are missing. I was completely happy with it. So I uncompleted way too dark to me is not a test to be one way or the other is whatever works at the end of the day, but whatever works means. So having the flexibility to say maybe the traditional monogamous ways, not the only fucking way to get there are other ways to go about it or just as good. Well, there certainly are other ways to go about it. I mean there's people that live in the house and it's a man with like three women, right? You know, or a woman with three men and it wasn't like a fucking drug dealer moving. Wasn't that like an Oliver Stone movie where there's a chicken two dudes and they used to have threesomes look so stupid. So stupid as it looks. I haven't seen the movie.

Speaker 2:          01:56:27       I read the book. The book was actually awesome. Yeah. The movie, I try to watch it. I quit that. It always looks great on paper, you know, it's just, it's very hard for people pull off that open relationship unless they're disgusting. I'll tell you what you want. You want to see disgusting people go to a swingers convention. Oh, fucking people are. He and I were in a, I think we're in Nashville and we did a whole weekend at this place and we had this guy drives around, uh, you know, we, we, uh, hired a car service and got the same guy to take us to the airport from the airport and we became friendly with him and as he's taken us to the airport at the end of the weekend, starts opening up about being a swinger out of nowhere. Man, we're fucking driving to the airport. He goes, Hey, well next time you guys in town, I'm be happy to take you to a swinger's party.

Speaker 2:          01:57:19       We're like, what? Huh? What are you talking about? Dude opens up that uh, him and his Mrs. have this relationship where he can decide like whether or not she sleeps with, uh, with other men. If he can, he can give the veto. Yeah. But uh, diesel out. Okay. Yes. That was. Yeah. So I go, well, how do you decide? He goes on legs, someone that just don't know. I don't want it happening. I go like, what? Like some hulking six foot five foot ball player with a giant Hog August thick is your calf like, is that what it is? And like he started getting uncomfortable and I'm like, well how are you? How can you be uncomfortable man? You just open up the doors saying that, you know, like what is it that turns you off about some Guy Banging your woman? Right? What? What's the big deal?

Speaker 2:          01:58:06       He could, he couldn't answer. He was starting to that. We got deep into it with them in the few minutes that we had left before we got to the airport, but we were laughing the entire flight home writers, guests. So bar sometime because you get eat the weird that I was with don cutting where, where are we? We call and we got off the plane, got in this cab and we closed the door. The guy started his ball to look right. It's like there was the cup that I ever started. Let me tell you about our governor. I heard governor socks because he started like this 50 minute monologue where he went and taught eddie clearly was just eating to get it off his chest. What we're looking at each other like what the fudge. We tell them to shut the fuck up, but we haven't divided the conversation.

Speaker 2:          01:58:49       We are not really participated and he just started for a word top to the last cycle. That's an evolution. Like a limo driver in an uber driver too. Like if you get a limo they kinda like they. Hello Sir. Let me open up the car door for you sir. It's like there's like, there's like going to a really nice hotel versus like a shitty motel where the, the person at the reception is smoking a cigarette, you know, you get what you pay for that. Again, a bucket. He managed to use that material for. I called him Eddie beat that he was also he. So I was like, Hey, look at that. Totally shifted conversation and come out with these. Awesome. Well, yeah, if someone's completely retarded or someone's completely out of whack, you could definitely make a good, a good sketch about it. This guy in Nashville, I still think about this guy.

Speaker 2:          01:59:37       Every time I go there, I'm just hoping I get him as a driver just like it's so what? Give me an update man I haven't seen in a couple of years. How's it all working out? That will be awesome. Yeah, I'm back there in May. I'm in uh, May 19th, I think, or 20th. I'm in Nashville, so I hope I'll find that dude. I'm really thinking about everybody. Everybody. Nashville, please ask your cup. I've heard what they seek about swinging gate. If you'll catch that. I guy send him back to Joel to pick him up at the airport because they have clubs that go to. They have specific swinging clubs. I'm like, well, how does that work? So I could everybody just, you know, sits on people's labs. You go to people and. But, but they all probably looked like him. He looked disgusting, you know, he's like a balding dude with a ponytail and he was tall, but he had a gut and like it was just skinny, but fat six, I was also bored.

Speaker 2:          02:00:28       You have your playboy. Does everybody look like they are out of that? That it's awesome to see the reality or like, oh that totally sucks. Yeah. The reality is most people that want to do that, they don't have a whole lot of other options, but there's probably only like one super hot slutty girl that goes to those things just loves being the Belle of the ball because if you go to like a swingers thing and you're actually hot or hot girl if everybody wants you. Do you remember there was a showtime show for awhile about people that were involved and like these big swinging sort of relationships now why was. It was terrible show, but it was, it was really weird because they would show them getting together and making out and doing all this stuff together, but it was like this obviously like really well lit room while they were filming, you know, because there was cameras on me.

Speaker 2:          02:01:23       These people were supposed to like, okay, everybody act normal. Yeah, exactly. It's like the comment off prs was these other reality show or something. Yeah. Huh? Yeah. It was on showtime. No. Yeah, it was just, it was a polyamorous show you found it was called polyamory. Yeah. That was it. It was gross. Get out of there with that very monitored family. Okay. It's not modern had been doing that forever. Okay. It's just, it's odd, but there's always like one dude who's like, you know, just like this is way people should be, man. They should just relax and just enjoy each other's company. Man. To me, that's the thing is I fuck shoulder. There's no shoulder. Whatever your rapid weight, if he works for you, it works for you. Exactly. I know. Star, it gives a shit. Do whatever you want. What makes you happy? That doesn't fuck over everyone else.

Speaker 2:          02:02:19       That's for anyone else or the environment, but people can say that you. If you want to fucking open relationship and fucks over my life. Danieli, do you understand? I need a man, a real man, a man who doesn't want another woman? You should. It shouldn't be a compromise. Should be. You want to stack of romance novels and lives based on this fucking artificial narrative created by fiction writers. Fucking fiction. I hate that shit, but what about those 50 shades of Grey bitches? I don't find those because that's an untapped freak vein out there in America. A big one, big one. A lot of chicks want to get choked and they're just not getting choked. What is that about, man that I don't get? We don't get it and we never will. That's the male female dynamic, unfettered, unrestrained that we don't understand. Never got understand it.

Speaker 2:          02:03:14       Some of that shit is entirely above. I want you to try the wrap your head around this mental exercise. Imagine you're a woman who is going to take a condom. The guy came in and squirt the contents inside your pussy or not. I can't imagine it. No, but those people were real. Yeah. So imagine that. A man who doesn't want to have a baby with you, but you want to have to pay with this motherfucker. How do I do this? I'm going to take the condom and stuff in my posting. Number it down and I'm gonna. Get my fingers in there and I'm a fucking shove it in there and we'll try to. I'm sure people have gotten pregnant that way, right? I'm sure you all pregnancy to all condoms. Come with spermicide. A lot of them do, right? The little sperm side in the kills them little fuckers.

Speaker 2:          02:04:00       Wow. That's some weird fucking people out there. Right? But that's a human thing. Like there's people that want to be connected so badly to someone that they'll lie about being on the pill. Like I've had friends that uh, they were having sex with a girl and the girl's like, I just don't, I'm not on the pill, but just so you can pull out. So they'll google, you know, when you dicks hard, you have like 10 percent mental capacity that you're operating on. Right. And so they tried to pull out and the girl wrap their legs around him and wouldn't let him pull out serious. Yeah. Yeah. More than one guys had that happen. I've talked to more than one guy happen. Yeah, I've heard like the, you know, I'm on the pl where it's bullshit and they get pregnant. No, I haven't. Third is one weird trick.

Speaker 2:          02:04:48       Pregnancy is fucking crazy cause it's, it's terrifying that not only did you fuck up so hard that you got someone pregnant, you didn't want to get pregnant, but they tricked you. They lied to you. And this, this is the type of person that you now have a child with. So you have to raise a child with a liar, a manipulative liar who decided to get pregnant. Ooh Boy. Oh yeah. There's a couple of nitinol weird. That's the lady got pregnant team time shortly after telling him, oh no, no chance in hell. And then of course he dcs under the file. This is the perfect family that then they tell their kids never have sex before marriage, Dah, Dah, Dah, and they were. I remember talking with their kid like the kid was like 14. I was telling me all about, oh shit, but they say no sex before marriage, ds and dace stocked with.

Speaker 2:          02:05:40       And I'm like, no, they didn't. Technical mind was bugging guys like my mom and dad met in Bible class and my mom was pure. The guy flipped. He was like, serious. I'm like, yeah, I don't lie to you. It's, that's where it sets. But at he was like, oh, holy shit. I was like, yeah man, I'm sorry. They just fed you a bunch of bullshit, but at least you've got relaxed. The Dep secs now just, you know, just the idea that some of them would be so many nipples and so self centered that they would decide to have a baby with someone against that person's will. Now that's, that's when you know, you see it as live problems, you know, that's where we are mentally fucked in the head. You're not just mentally fucked. You're now connected to this person. You're you, you like that you've, you're not just mentally fucked and manipulative and evil, but you're connected to a person who had a baby with you know, and it was all because you live.

Speaker 2:          02:06:34       It was weird. It's weird. Sex is weird because it's, it makes people feel good. Like if it was just like hugging or just like, you know, being affectionate and just making out and like, oh, that's all great, but it makes people like blow jobs don't make people, they're awesome, but they do not make people. Fucking actually makes people like what a bizarre way of reproducing that be about it. Like you're drawn to someone you can't live without them. The touches so magical. Find your person what ridiculous. That's when you got to see that the universe has been designed by somebody with them. Lots of sense of your worry if there is any design behind it because he's like so much of a shit. He's just fun. It's just like, it's funny, but it all makes sense. I mean this the only way to really truly ensure that people have sex when times are tough and you know the world is rough and logically and intellectually you wouldn't have a baby, but you have a baby and you have to figure out a way to hide it from the barbarian hordes because you love it so much and you have these urges and meanwhile the reason why the barbarian hordes are showing up in the first place because they're looking for pussy.

Speaker 2:          02:07:50       So little things crazy. That's the when he studied, what does it show? Some condoms use to contain spermicides, but most don't. It's best to use condoms without spermicide says who? The person who wants babies. You fuck

Speaker 5:          02:08:03       it says the most looking at right now. So spermicide can actually increase. Chances of sti is such as HIV chlamydia because it can cause the irritation which can lead to the rubbing and blood shadow.

Speaker 2:          02:08:17       Maybe on your Dick, Bro. Not Mine. My, my, my, my Dick Lapses. Promissory, my digs. Like whatever bro. But um, if you have like Lambskin, I think lambskin condoms, you can get pregnant anyway. Like the ges can get through those things and I definitely know the diseases can. I thought there was no pregnancy by yes diseases. I want to know how when heterosexual people like Charlie Sheen gets HIV. Come on Charlie, you come clean about everything. What were you doing? I want to know what you were doing. Right? We share needles with somebody. Like what were you doing? Did you take it in the booty? Right? What were you doing? There's no shame in your game, right? Man. Come clean. Come clean. The problem is that he charged the case. I don't think he burst. No, I'm sure I did. Sad thing, but who knows? He's so hilarious because when he came out and talked about it, it wasn't like he wants to set the record straight. He just doesn't want to pay anybody anymore, so he decided to just to put up, put a stop to all the financial bleeding that was going on in his life.

Speaker 2:          02:09:27       That's a. that's an interesting tale. The Charlie Sheen tale because it went from a tale of sort of almost like heroic excess to like a sadness thing. Yeah. Victim ever. See his teeth? No, like falling out of his head. Yeah. Yeah. There's photos or I dunno. I guess smoking cracks. Not good for your teeth. Yeah, I would imagine. I would guess that Fox and CNN, one of his girls that he used to date says fucking teeth are all falling out and then if you see him when he smiles he smiles like this. Like it's Kinda like his, his lips are cold, curled over his teeth. He like, yeah. It's like, it seems fun when you hear about it. He's doing blow and that's how he rolls and he's having hookers and. But then at the end of it you realized like, Oh, this guy is probably like completely out of control. You know, I'm probably a slave to these chemicals, but also talented enough that he can figure out a way to make absorb it and amounts of money and he has really smart people behind them because you went from that two and a half men show where he made exorbitant amounts of money to this other show, which was a terrible show.

Speaker 4:          02:10:34       Which one was it? To? Anger management. Oh yeah. Terrible Shell. But he got an insane deal where they filmed all 100 episodes, like really quickly. And so he made hundreds of millions of dollars. They were afraid it would end the traveling. No, it's um, it's a thing where you, um, it's like a guaranteed syndication deal where if they did that they would do like a 10 90, like the way that the show would work. Like you would do 13 episodes and then you would do the back nine and the back nine would equal 22, which is a real season. So like when we first did news radio, I think the first season we did like 13 episodes. And then if you get a pickup, everybody gets excited. Oh we got to pick up for the back nine. So would they decided to do inside instead of that was due a 10 90.

Speaker 4:          02:11:18       So you do the first 10 episodes and the first 10 episodes go well you get picked up for the full hundred. Yeah. So the idea is like, look, we've got a hit on our hands, let's negotiate accordingly. Let's go. We got Charlie Sheen, I don't know if you know, but Charlie Sheen was a big part of anger or two and a half men made billions of dollars for the network and we can do the same thing for you fx and so they, they bought hook line and sinker into this deal and it just fucking went right into the shit to her. No success whatsoever. Like it was just that not only talk about, nobody watched it or what to a good question because I imagine watching the beginning watch artist just because it's like a train wreck about the weapon. Well, it was not a bad show at first.

Speaker 4:          02:12:00       It was one of those shows where people watched it and it got like those. It's hard to do a good Sitcom, man. There's not a lot of good writers. You have to have really good dedicated writers that are funny and then you have to have an actor who knows how to pull it off. You have to have a show runner who's got experience and putting those things together. There's an art form to creating a sitcom all, all itself. You know, I was on one for five years and I got to see it pretty intimately from a bunch of different levels, from like the level of like really talented, really smart actors who configure out how to manipulate a scene and make it funny and the level of really smart and really good writers who really know how to craft a scene and then networks with good ideas and networks with shit ideas and then you've got to put them all together and good luck and then you have to back then you had to have a good time slot to.

Speaker 4:          02:12:50       That was a big part of it because Peter had to know that you were on it. Gay Now times have changed, right? Nobody cares about it anymore. It's just not even an issue, but that's why Netflix has got it down. Watch it whenever you want. Not only that, the whole season comes out at once. That's of photo. That's the best way I can watch seeing. So one episode, one week, one episode, the next. That to me is bullshit. I wait for them to be able to just tune spoilers out and if I cashed out for gas anyway, doesn't matter. Engine just being donate once it comes out with and just watch every single to 30 days and be done with it. I don't know. I watch, um, I watch walking dead every week. You're watching it on TV. I don't watch it. Like while it's on tv, I'll watch it on itunes the next day I'll watch on appletv.

Speaker 4:          02:13:36       I wait for them. Fuck those commercials. That's ridiculous. What do I have to pay five bucks to not have a commercial? Fuck you. That's it. My time is way more valuable than those 15 minute chunks where you just interrupt with stupid music and dancing frogs or whatever the fuck is Geico then. Oh, I'm selling insurance. Fuck. He's just ruined a Zombie show. You've ruined the show is awesome. It's a good show. It gets better one with the La one. I saw that one. The walking dead. They only did a few episodes, but it's well really well directed and well shot show and really well acted d. only thing I agree with you, I said, awesome. It's very well done. The only thing I didn't dig where the characters, you know the character stuff, the main story of the walking dead or something cool characters that you dig, that you care about them.

Speaker 4:          02:14:28       These guys, you've kind of want them to all get eaten by zombies. Don't fuck about Daniel for them. They are all like, I want the woman to freak out. She doesn't seem to freak out. Very. Yes. Yeah. She's almost to calm. She should be shitting her pants for eating people all around you, bitch. Your neighbors are monsters. They haven't turned into a Zombie looking either. They're like, they haven't deteriorated enough yet. The beginning with the steel looks mostly human. I'd like it though. I think it takes time to develop those characters, but like as far as the way it's shot and acted, it seems like it's Daniella. We're almost out of time, my friend. I got to get the fuck out of here. Cool. What else is going on? What should I tell? I tell people about history on fire for sure. You're amazing podcast.

Speaker 4:          02:15:15       Thank you, my man and you, uh, you opened up first episode with that first episode, but episode, not zero, but episode one was with one of my favorite stories you've ever told that fucked up story about the crucifixions. I feel it's a fucking of stories. The latest one I think was episode five as a story to make it a crucifixion look like at these Ne Bowlby. What is it about a, there's a story. It's a complicated long story, but to go for the essential element, there's like these two Persian brothers were putting sis who are fighting for days in the CV of the water for power and I'm the mom of both of the guys. He speaks to and off them and get killed. And so at one point she's already pissed off and she wants the guy who actually killed their son to be executed, but she can't ready to go through a rather song and say execute this motherfucker.

Speaker 4:          02:15:59       Because he was doing, he was obeying and so orders. Right? So she find a way for him to fuck up for him to say something that will piss off or rather than the king. And then the way the execute this annuity is, they put me in a box, we thought he said he saw her Monday slags sticking out with buddies, sold baldies property bulks. They force feed him horny and other weird shit that for the next few days the guy is being forced, fed, started shooting all over inside the bulks. These tracks matt goats like flies the lay

Speaker 3:          02:16:30       magazine there and stuff. And he literally started walking their way inside of him. So he has maggots hatching inside of him and meeting him for the next two weeks and they're file happy tails from the award. The kind of crazy shit that you want to be. I mean, what a crazy mother fuckers sit down and think, I want to kill somebody, but I don't just want to kill him. Let's figure out in a slow torture method of killing someone that's pretty fucking weird.

Speaker 4:          02:17:00       God damn creative. You look at what they did during the inquisition, all the different ways that killed people. Yup. Yup,

Speaker 3:          02:17:07       yeah, the game of thrones one where they put the rat on your stomach, put up late on a light that's a through star. That's like inquisition stuff. They did that for real, but actually just so not all of his thrill fireys about crazy stuff that are actually some pleasant stories here and there, but yeah, of course they weird moments. Our data as well. There's one that you would dig. I think the episode three was about the iceman to guide that they found in the Alps for 5,000 years ago and he's kind of like this murder mystery because we have found out that he was shot with an arrow. We found all these scenes about these life and death or some crazy ass details that archaeology can give us about this guy's life. What he was doing there, savvy dance that he may have been doing acupuncture 2000 years before it was ever done in China that were like crazy stuff.

Speaker 3:          02:17:58       But what was the evidence of him doing acupuncture? Needles? No, they found like these tattoos, but they're not that. It was like artistic that they are like dots and the lines and they roll along the acupuncture points. They are all alone points where he was in pain, so they think that he was kind of some form of acupuncture that you would dig in that spot with needles and then you would see late with like possibly like the way they do mock trial where they burned herb, some bright spots and the leaves that's probably out of those attitudes originated. It's creepy. It's like that rewrites history in so many ways, like some crazy European 2000 years before acupuncture was in China, was doing something very similar to Trudet. Pretty Weird in itself. Never mind the whole murder mystery aspect of it. Also, I don't know. I dig they stories. There are so many out there in history that I have a field agent speaking one and then researching the hell out of it for a couple of moments.

Speaker 4:          02:18:51       There's another new one that we're saying, reef rewrites history. They've found a mammoth of a dead body of a mammoth that had a clear evidence of human predation, like one of the ribs had been shattered, they think with a spear or something like that, but the problem was it was 45,000 years old and Siberia and they didn't even know that people were their back. Right. So like they got it. Okay. Well, I guess we're a little off here with the time too. It's just, it just keeps going on and on. I don't remember. I don't remember the exact specific details. The story. That's almost the problem with the over abundance of stories in the Internet. You almost get too many of them. I know. They're just coming at you all day. I was starting that to Jamie right before we started. I was like, Jesus Christ, I love Internet, but at the same time I need to get out there wasting time because it's just too much.

Speaker 4:          02:19:35       Too much. There's good stuff. Too much. You could go down or motherfucking rabbit hole. I went down a penis, a penis operation rabbit hole. The other day somebody sent me a link. Matt stags. Actually sent me a link to some guy who grew back is for skin when I was like, all right, let's see what he did. So this guy like put like weights and stretched out. It's for skin and all this different shit. And so then from that you know like the suggestions over the right hand side on youtube. One of them was like this penis operation. I was like, oh, so then I go to this thing and this guy is under and this guy they install a pump and his ball sack and so the doctor with his rubber gloves covered in blood is squeezing on this guy's balls and it's turned.

Speaker 4:          02:20:18       These guys don't work. What? Like that's what liberace had. Apparently he had one of them pumps. They put a a like a pump. You're pumping your dick up with fluid. I guess it's like a fluid in there and then you hit a button and it releases it and your Dick goes flacid again. Fuck and bizarre. The head doesn't get hard though. The head is like sort of like a floppy head. It didn't seem like I was disappointed because it kind of defeats the purpose. I was just. It was strange numbers. All these other penis operations that I just. I couldn't do it. I couldn't do it. Couldn't get into it. That's the third editorial. Yeah. You can go deep. You can go deep. All right. Daniela [inaudible]. Thank you very much, sir. Your book. Not Afraid. It is outright. Now, Danielle, a author also have create your own religion.
