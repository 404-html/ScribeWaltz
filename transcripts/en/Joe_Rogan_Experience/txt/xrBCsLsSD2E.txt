Speaker 1:          00:00:01       What does that free kick is Dan? Oh No, I meant to wear at the panel yesterday. Uh, I actually, I was late and I forgot what we're talking about here folks is he has a free Keka Stan shirt. And I just learned about this very recently from Jordan Peterson. Yeah. He loves it. I had no idea. I didn't know what the deal with the frog was. And do you know that you can't have the frog now. What does it on itunes? Apple Itunes won't let you use the frog is great. What the fuck people what? What is apple doing? It's a frog. It's a cartoon frog. Hillary Clinton denounced it. So she did now to Rog. Oh yeah. She said something about deplorables. What'd she say about the frog? Oh, it was part of um, uh, an article on a website. Oh, they were saying how this causing frog is a hate symbol and so you're a fucking idiot. He come home with him.

Speaker 1:          00:00:57       This is the best bit about the incident. We can make them, well, they look ridiculous on their own. Every means day. It's just we're saying they were already like doing the bad thing, lumping people into these groups. But it is a weird thing that they don't understand. Like whoever gets upset at this does not understand how preposterous it is to freak out about a frog. And who the fuck is over at apple? First of all. What about the poor bastard that made pepe the frog for totally non Keka Stan Oh nine incident red pill reasons. This poor bastard just had this cartoon frog did. He made feels bad man. You know? And then all of a sudden that poor guy has to say, I'm killing off. Pepe did in the inner is like, bitch, you not kill him off shit. Nobody knows who you are, but everyone knows who pepe is.

Speaker 1:          00:01:45       You can't kill off something like that. That's so crazy. It's silly to think that he could have achieved as well. Everybody's so it's almost like they have to denounce it. Yeah. You know? Otherwise they'll get lumped in with a supporter. Like he probably does think that he's a, people think he's a supporter maybe. Well, I don't think they do. I think he's like, Oh, you know, I don't know what's going on. SONA. Stan of it. I haven't, when he looked in stuff too much. It's weird man. Because like, you know, um, people think there'd been shadow banned like a Scott Adams had a big post the other day. We're city's been shadow banned phobias. Yeah. And He's put, he said he talked to Jack at twitter and Jack said there's no shadow banning. I talked to Joe Shuts Up Jack. We know this show. This is Sargon speaking just full of shit. We know Jacksonville. Holy Shit. Why the fuck it was like a nice guy. Jack. Tell me, Jack, why haven't I been verified? Well, he's probably super busy with the 400 billion people that are on twitter. Probably super full of Shit. And so if you tried three times and every time that just denied why, I mean, what is it then have enough? How many followers do you have? 200,000 that's supposed to Claudia accounts by me. My friends need to know who I am on twitter. Don't you think that's the reason that for verification Jag, isn't that

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       interesting? Because if you were on a television show, it would be expected that you would be verified by now with that kind of following. That's a giant following and your 30,000 on Youtube. So yeah, that's a lot of people. Seems worth firefighting before, but it's not, it's a badge of status, which is one of the verified Milo. I mean, that's the most ridiculous one. D verifying. So you can't do that, but verify someone and then not milo anymore as it jack like the guy. Yeah, you're a fucking lie. You know, it's a badge of status. You know, you're doing it to create some sort of privileged class on twitch. I mean, they even get like a different function, don't they? Well, you can only see some of the verified hell. Every account on twitter should be verified thing you do. Right? You're allowed to only see a counselor verified.

Speaker 2:          00:03:44       Yeah, it's a privilege. And he took it away from mine to punish him for being a dissident. And he won't verify me to punish me for being a dissident. And he knows it. This is a stranger. You're fucking balls deep in this dude. You feel it? You're like very emotionally invested. Oh yes. Oh yeah. That's, cause I've, I've never, I've never had to play the game. I'm, I'm where I am now entirely on my own merits. I've never, I've never had any industry connections. I've never been, I've never been to America before. I've never spoken to any of these people. They all knew who I am and they're all afraid of me because I think because if I can do it, anyone can do it. But why, why do you think it's fear? Why do you think is, well, we definitely don't need them. No one needs anybody anymore.

Speaker 2:          00:04:26       But that's a good thing. But you can't create a system of privilege without interdependent connections. There is no system of privilege if you don't have to rely on other people to maintain a privilege class. If you don't have to maintain the privilege class and you can't, you don't have to rely on other people, then their status goes away. Let's break this down for people who don't know what the fuck we're talking about. Okay. Your, um, may I call you Carl? That's your actual name, right? I that cool. He dead naming me. He doxing. Doxing. But you've already been doxed we were discussing this. Yeah. Now I'm your youtube account. You have great videos. Really great commentary. Very smart guy. And how did you get involved? I mean, are you like, what, is this a you and outright guy? No, you're not right. Yeah, they, they'll ride is an identitarian movement for white people.

Speaker 2:          00:05:13       They're, they're heavily nationalist, protectionist, anti interventionist. They're not like laissez faire free market capitalist. I'm a liberal. I am, I'm like an English liberal as in I want universal rights. Laissez faire, capitalism. I don't mind. I mean socialized health care and a well a welfare state. I'm happy with as long as it's universal. It was all done. Just applied some as long as anyone could access it if they needed to. Um, just universal rights rule. I don't, I don't see the, I can't see a reason to discriminate against someone when it comes to dealing with rights. Well, who's, who's, um, like defining outright is it been clearly defined now because it's so new, it's actually relatively well defined now because the old right have asserted themselves. I said, look, no, we're for white people. You know, Wipro while saying that, which, which guys like, he knows I'm like Ramsey pole as soon as expensive, but as soon as someone like that says they're all right, then everybody else just assumes that they like allows them to define it because I think there's probably a lot of people considered the cells all right.

Speaker 2:          00:06:15       Where they were right wing, but they weren't racist. They weren't, or white supremacists, they just didn't like this old man. Right. That was in there for four, I think they call themselves the ultra lights. I don't know. I don't know whether that's at a time of disparagement or not. Um, but I over new rights or something like that. But the thing is I don't run in the circles. So actually I actually don't really know very much about those guys out of the pool. Jessie Watson's incentive itches. I don't find that particularly offensive. I just find them to be like a modern form of conservatism. I think Paul Joseph Watson is a very reasonable guy and he's very articulate. He seems pretty smart. He, he, he does the opposite of what the media does, but the end, it's it. That's not, that's not a criticism. Two points. Yeah, exactly.

Speaker 2:          00:06:59       I thought a lot of things, absolutely. I think it's necessary for him to exist. You know, he's like, you know, cause they both create narratives and the, it's not that these narratives aren't true, it's just that sometimes these narratives sometimes leave things out. But always, this isn't like a condemnation of either side by saying this, this is just what they do and that's okay. You know, everyone's entitled to create their own sort of, and I'm going to use the word propaganda, but again, I'm not using it in a derogatory sense. Right. It's, I mean, you're like, look, I want to make this point. I'm not, I don't want to make your point, you know, because you're making your point. I'm going to make my point and the these two points, we'll both stand in existence and we'll both be true at the same time. Hmm.

Speaker 2:          00:07:38       And so it's okay if Paul Joseph Watson to exist, you know, it's fine. I don't have a problem with them. I don't have, I don't really have any criticisms of it to be honest. Otherwise, you know, you know, I, I mean I wouldn't do what he's doing, but what is he doing that you wouldn't do? It gets a bit harder than I would and he didn't. I don't think he is as objective as I would prefer having a new source. I prefer someone more like Philly d, You know, isn't that an interesting thing? The objectivity is a, this is a real, real problem when it comes to left versus right or any of these groups. You get lumped into these categories and then you start defending your turf. And uh, that, that seems to be a huge issue today. Yet, everybody just started digging their heels in the sand and decides this is who I am.

Speaker 2:          00:08:19       And those other p and you start using they and them, which is what I try to avoid that the bad guys. Yeah, they and they, what they want, what the left wants. And it's, it's, it's really tough actually because, um, that I've, I'm actually done like channel. Uh, I've actually pulled my subscribers and stuff and I've got like, it was a bit like a year ago, but I'm a content hasn't really changed. Tena and I got like tens of thousands of responses, so it was a really good sample size. Uh, most of, most of my subscribers are center left liberals who just lost, you know, then identitarian is, they don't want to sit there and go, you know, I mean, I was at vidcon and they had so many panels and they're like, let me about me being a Latin x. Let me talk about me being in a Latina.

Speaker 2:          00:08:58       And it's like, what a Latinex lots of next year. Nonbinary loveliness. I'll come over and I'm not, I'm not making this up. And I'm joking. I wouldn't, I wouldn't make anything up and I won't lie to you. Right. I'm absolutely serious. This sort of, but the thing is what really annoys me about identity politics, right? Um, when they're like, Yo, let me tell you about my identity. So I look, dude, that's none of my fucking business. I don't care about your fucking identity. Do not tell me how you identify. It's not my problem. It's not my business. It's not political. And if you want to make it political, I'm going to tell you shut up and fuck off cause I don't care. Hey Joe, let me say, yeah, of course it is. Let me tell you about my white identity. We do this. Yeah. See I told you Tino pay versus Latin x versus Latin II.

Speaker 2:          00:09:39       Which word best solves Spanish gender problem? Really addressing the hard hitting issues here. Jesus, Rachel, Richard Reichard, Rick, when I say your name, Gray card. Right card, right? Yeah. What are the best Spanish has gender. What? Gender problem. Exactly. Exactly. I've made up. Well it is. It's talking about themselves. They're not to point real problems. Is this what happens when you have too many vaccines? I, I think it's what happens when you have too much money. We have people that are just too, it's too easy to get by. This is a sim money, food lenzer thinking, hey, people give a shit what I care what I think of my genitals. No, ready. Get Out. Yeah. Unless you're sticking him in my face, I really don't give a fuck. Yeah, exactly. But then that's an interpersonal thing. It's not like a political problem. No, it's not a political problem.

Speaker 2:          00:10:28       Well, I mean what I mean, the politics of human interaction, I guess. Yeah. It's a little bit of that knows me most is when they say, let me tell you about my blackness and like, what the hell do you mean by your blackness? And they're like, well, meet me as a black person. You're going to, you're going to start stereotyping yourself. You're going to tell you, you're going to give me a stereotype of black people, and then you're gonna say this is somehow representative nothing to you but other people. But then you're validating Richard Spencer when he says, Hey, can I told her about my whiteness? What's your argument saying? They're not allowed to do that. Well, I know what's wonderful. Why not? You'll talk to me about your blackness. I'll talk about my whiteness and all of a sudden we're going to both realize, you know, we're just talking about ourselves, which is talking about ourselves.

Speaker 2:          00:11:04       Why don't we talk about something real it did you see that woman, the Delaware professor who, um, was talking about that kid that got killed in North Korea, the kid who stole the propaganda poster know about the kid. I haven't seen the professor talking about, Oh man. Each fall she just got fired today, which is nice. It's a good sign. Yeah, but what, what she had said is essentially he had it coming and that she's tired of rich and blamers rich, clueless white people who come to her class and then she just goes on these, this series of Straw Mans, I'll have to do coke and have no problem raping a girl at a Frat party. Whoa. Whoa. Where'd that come from? This guy just got beaten to death in Korea and he shouldn't have raped girls. He didn't rape anybody. He did coke like this bitch.

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       No one should go fine. Well, she's apparently, you know. Yeah. It's just racist. She's racist towards white people. I mean, you can be that and that's an oh yeah. That's one of the wonderful things about the social justice warrior movement is that they've made it so it's impossible to be raped, racist towards white people. They believe they believe it. Yeah. This is a real belief that if you are a white person, you're personal privilege and racism is something that a person of privilege does to a person and a compromise group. Yeah. Do you know he's pretty funny about it. Is they by saying it's a power plus prejudice. They make it, they say rice institutional and is that okay? But that means you're taking away the word for interpersonal racism. So if like an Asian guy goes up to a black guy and says, hey, enwood that copy racism, because he doesn't have institutional power and there is no word for racism between individuals. Now you've redefined it to be institutional. So what is the word for interpersonal? Yeah, it's, I thought it will Chris rock bit about February. Black Dude thinks he's tough as a native American white and kick his ass.

Speaker 2:          00:12:56       I'm more marginalized group. It says it is one of those things where it's like people are seeking problems and there's, they're also seeking to clearly identify themselves as being from a more compromised group. Politics. A victim. Yeah, exactly. I'm the victim here at me. Some special treatment. It's like, dude, I don't want to be a victim. You feel about the Trans racialism I think there's no logical argument that Kingston can identify as an Eskimo as far as I can send you. Can they, there was a big Hoohah or in academia recently because someone published a paper, I'll come in the name of the person published papers saying, well look, what's the argument against this? If you can identify as another agenda, why can't you identify as another race? St Logic is applied to a different, not necessarily because the argument of you identify with another gender could be based on some sort of a hormonal issue or um, some neurotransmitter misfire there.

Speaker 2:          00:13:47       There could be some something that could be physically that could be, if any of their arguments were hinges on the idea that that mattered, but it's not, they say, well you can identify as anything you won't cause it's all the social construct so you can do whatever you want with that. Yeah. That's where it gets slippery, right? Yeah. Where it gets really slippery is that sex and gender are social constructs. It's like, well look, clearly that's not true in in it actually a district, they all social constructs. But the thing is they're not sexy. It's not a social construct to say let's go. Sex is based on your chromosomes and your agenda is a group of constructed behaviors around them. Constructed for a good reason. Men have got, you know, clinical, superior, natural advantage and things like strength and speed of women and women need protection when they all say pregnant.

Speaker 2:          00:14:29       You know, when they're looking after kids, they need society to look off to them because they have something that the needs protecting. And so we've got a whole and Inca society. The reason you can tell that these are actually social constructs, it's because every site is different. I mean, in Saudi Arabia, the men walk in front, the women walk behind and they keep their heads down and get and then they shut the fuck up. That's a social construct. And that's agenda role, you know? Right. But that's a cultural, that's a gender role. And that's my point. You know, for us, we don't do it. But it's not just necessarily, I mean it's not like a, so like a social construct, meaning that this is something that occurs all the time. Even in primates. I mean there's a lot of behavior that males exhibit in nature. Not saying there's no relation to biology, but saying the they, is it a social construct?

Speaker 2:          00:15:12       Well, it's, it's a behavior that we have. It's, it's not like something that's consistent, like, you know, oh, the old man [inaudible] the Dicks is not a social construct. Right, right. Every, every man on earth does this, but not every woman on earth has to walk behind her man, suddenly 10 paces back because she's female in the West. It's actually know the other way, you know, the amount of opens door, the wind goes, Whoa, there's agenda role, but it's not the same. So it can be changed. It is a social construct, but that doesn't mean that that isn't agenda role. There is always a gender role. It's always informed by biology because men and women are fundamentally different and they always will be. Well, that's where people get slippery with you, right? That's where they want. Are they like in that way, they like it in that way.

Speaker 2:          00:15:51       What is that? Who's the one feminist? There's one really nutty young lady who was saying that, um, even physical strength is just because men are encouraged to do physical things. Are you referring to um, uh, one and suck he's in? Is that her? Did she? She's definitely said that. Did she say that? Yeah. Oh, come on. I know she's loony, but did she go that far? There is a school of feminist thought that thinks this they the the, Oh, that's a fun one. They really believe that the physical strength differences between men and women are just because of the way society treats women and as men are socialized to do sports. I'm thinking, come on, that can't be real. She just thinks that she said it. I didn't know whether she believes and see if he can find that. She'd say she's from a video from like 2013 or something.

Speaker 2:          00:16:32       She seems quite the opportunist. Wow. She on the trust and verify galactic counsel, what she seth and he was, which was probably one of your wives and reasons Jack and then as she sent any wells, which is probably one of the reasons Jack, that I'm not verified you say she certainly was. She was still a, I don't know whether she's still, but I know that she's sending was a, at least a contact for them. But there's been a bit of an interesting development with ms sockies in if you'd like to hear about it. Well, tell people who she is. Uh, it doesn't even need no if I need to, but most people don't know. You'll live in a very insulated world. Like straight ass. My mom. Oh yeah. You momondo but with them at the incident. Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course. You're mumbling. Uh, okay. And he's stuck. He's in is an internet feminist who decided the off the off the making a bunch of videos on our youtube channel and late 2009 through to 2010 or something, uh, 12, um, she ended up getting a favorable reception with the progressive intelligence. Yeah. We're very feminist, very pro social justice. And they liked her patter because it's, um, pretty stock, pretty, pretty stuck in trade and it's, and she was, she came across as being very respectable. You know, she's well presented, she's attractive. She's well spoken. She, she knows

Speaker 3:          00:17:49       her pastor. And so they promote her. They, they made a big deal over, she sounds like a total bigot when she's talking about anything big it, yeah. Also because she'll just say, well this is men. I mean the whole premise of feminism is that men are oppressing women and if men aren't oppressing women than feminism has no argument and they also have a sort of thing they say to each other, you have the rights to hate, your oppressor is right to do this. And it's like, okay, but I don't think it's have a right to hate even if you want. But this is something that she said personally, personally over there. She probably has said it personally, but this is the, the sort of ideological thought. I mean if you read their papers, if you read that, if you read the new one that they them thing again.

Speaker 3:          00:18:34       Right. Okay. They're talking about hardcore feminists. We are talking about like a specific sphere of academic feminists in her case, sex negative. Xix neg. What? Yeah, they don't, they don't, they don't like objectification or they don't like sexy women in titties. Sex negative. Yeah. They don't like sexy women. And the male gaze is oppressing women Croft Tomb Raider. Gotcha. Yeah. That was the, that was part of the big issue, right. It was like sexist because of Lara Croft. Terrible, terrible oppression. I don't know how women can get over it, but a, and he suck. He's in stepped up and was like, you know, it's wrong to look at these tits. And everyone was like, she's wearing a really tight top for a reason and she's not real. Yeah. Uh, but yeah, so basically any psyches and comes from a school of sex, negative feminism. And she decided that she would take advantage of all this.

Speaker 3:          00:19:22       Now in 2010 there was a video, I think it was 2010 that the video was recorded in black and white of herney university giving a speech where she says, I'm not a Gamer. I had to learn a lot about gaming to get into all this and then come 2012 I mean that that video wasn't released until after she did her tropes versus women in gaming. Kickstarter 2012 May, 2012 she starts as kickstarter. And when I was in within the first few days, she starts posting updates on that I'm being harassed and said, well yeah, people generally react negatively to phenomenal bigots on the Internet. They don't like it. People don't like him. I mean like when you say men are oppressing women and everything she says is a variant of men are oppressing women in it is the male gaze is highly oppressive to women. Toxic masculinity is highly or preston women's.

Speaker 3:          00:20:05       Okay. When, when come in legitimately look at women in eater, no answer. What is, what is non toxic masculinity? There's no such thing. So what you're saying is masculinity and men checking out chicks is just bad and you hate it and the men are all bad for doing this and there are pressing the women when they do miss well. That's why I said it seems like she's a bit of a fight. She's got an angle and she realizes that there's a lot of attention that goes towards that angle and she runs with it. I mean if I turned around and said, well women, a bunch of miniature manipulative slags who will take your money and run, they be like, you're a fucking massage, but I got to stop you there. Cause I don't think she's ever said all men. I don't think she said that she doesn't, she just uses the term men. I don't think she does. I mean I really don't think says she

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       had, that guy is her fucking head guy writes for what Mecca is sad. I know I'm just doing now nothing basically the, this, this terrible thing. But I want to, I want to set the record straight if you thinks, because this, this is something that really annoys me. So, um, I went to vidcon recently and vidcon. Yeah. What does that youtube convention in Anaheim sounds a good time. It was a really good time for me, but it wasn't, it wasn't for them that their panels look like a bloody death march when they spot a sing in the car. Their life faces like, oh God. I was like, why did they get upset at you? Yeah. Just cause we sat there, listened to what they had to say. In fact, if you heard about this dude, I'm insulated. Oh dude, this is crazy. So it's like easy.

Speaker 2:          00:21:29       And uh, she spots me sitting in the audience and then she starts freaking out. Freaking out. Yeah. She starts, she starts saying things like, there's a constant harasser of mine called me, you know, she called me a shithead. It, she called me a garbage human, a garbage human. I did nothing to her. I didn't say a word. I just sat in the audience while she's there cussing me out on the stage. And I mean this, now she's on the stage with a microphone. She's just calling you a shithead and the garbage human. And this was because you have made videos about her. Is that what it is? Because I've made videos debunking her points and she, she's under the impression that all of my videos are about her. And I actually on the ride over, I got people to like count up for me. Uh, I've, I've made around 30 videos and about four years referring to, and that's a lot.

Speaker 2:          00:22:14       No, no, no. It sounds nice. Did it sounds like a lot, but that's less than 4% of the videos I've made. I've made 780 videos. I work hard. I'm sure you do. But that's still 30 videos. I don't care if you've made 100 million videos, you still make 30 videos about her. That's a large number. Maybe it's a large number compared to an Ito who hardly does any bloody work. But, but that's, that's another interesting point. But what's, what's interesting about it is if someone puts something out there, you know, you going to get, expect that someone is going to come along, especially a guy like you that is very opinionated. And if someone has very different opinions in yours, you're going to have a contrary point. Of course, there's definitely not harassing but can't be. We're in a scary position if that's exactly what fine.

Speaker 2:          00:22:59       So how are we, how will you harassing? Like what, what was the, and that's the thing, the worst thing you've ever said about her, that she's wrong. Yeah. Well. Yeah, I mean, she, you will never find someone who says she's a, she's a good critic. She's a terrible critic, and she always has been. She's always been, it's always been rightly pointed out to her that she's cherry picked every time. No one stands by her work. She's become like a symbol of feminism because will the harassment she's received now that is a part of the problem. Right. Okay. Tim Culture, it's very strange. It's like you don't get any props unless someone's sending you horrible messages. And then, because a lot of people have been caught doing it to themselves, which is really fucked up, Eh, loads like the black lives matter activists and whatnot. But yeah, so basically she's, her work sucks. It's, it's just bad. I mean, nobody in the

Speaker 3:          00:23:45       video game industry will turn around say, you know what? That's great criticism. Need to only, only like the progressive press. What black lives matter. Oh, he's just got a protest. They basically run around and to the university's compute system logged into a fake twitter account or something, send themselves a bomb threat and the police tracked it down and they're like, we have the video camera footage if you yeah, yeah, it was, it was actually really funny. Um, but yeah, it's so funny with their need to be a victim. Well it validates them. It renewed just when you don't have an argument and you need to be a victim. Well does she expect that or know that she's going to be able to put these points out and not have anybody dispute these points? Well, I'm guessing so. And she always, she always conflates all criticism with harassment.

Speaker 3:          00:24:27       She's never addressed the critic. And the first time she was dressed as a critic, it's me and she's calling me names. Yeah. That's how I go. That's not sounding good level. Yes. Not, not very good. Good luck. She said, she says, I'm responsible for all of the harassment now. All of it. Well at least definitely not hers. That's not her fault. And then it's a controversial opinion and someone disputes it. That person disputes it. Is responsible for all the restaurant. Yeah. Well basically I've, I've always, I've always said right from the get go, don't have a contact them. Don't ever contact them because for a start, I mean, they don't want to listen. She's not interested in hearing your fucking opinion so that we're both, she's got nothing but contempt for you. But secondly, don't send a harassment because a, it's immoral and b, she's got the victim card that gives her money when she, when you go, when you send her a message saying, Hey, neither, I think you're a bitch.

Speaker 3:          00:25:13       She goes, Chich Ching, you know, and then she runs off to the next interview. We'll that she gets paid some of her speeches at university. She's been paid 20 grand a speech. That's hilarious. I'm not joking. Right. And it's just, and for her to go, the Internet is being mean to me. Well, maybe if you want to be in a bigger online, they wouldn't be. Maybe if you actually did some solid work and didn't say video games are making everyone's sexist, which that obviously not, this wouldn't be happening to you. But the, the thing that pisses me off most about the accusations towards me of harassment, apart from the fact that I've never harassed her, and if there was any evidence, I'd harassed that it'd be all over the Internet right now. You know, I mean you, it would be nothing but twix bars because they trying to paint me as a harasser when I'm actually just a critic oppose.

Speaker 3:          00:25:51       And I've always been completely against it. But what really annoys me is that her kickstarter, if you look at it now, if you get go to it, you can pull it up now and you can see tropes versus women and like, you know, she's got to spill and then, oh, the terrible messages, the harassment, the harassment. That was in May, 2012 I didn't make a video on Youtube until July, 2013 this has been happening to her her whole career. It's nothing to do with me. It's to do with her. It's because she's a dick. Everyone can see it. Like God Guy Pussy. Yeah, I'm culinary Dick. You're a dick. And he said, Dick, he looked into the cam. Do you know? Do you want to know something? I've spoken to a lot of interesting people recently since I've been here, lots of people who know you personally, an eater and they say everyone hates you because you're a dick. Oh, this has getting mean Dj. You shouldn't see she put up about

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       me today. Another one. Oh yeah, it's calling me harassing, calling me all this stuff. It's like, no, you're a dick. Anita. It did you find a video of her saying that there's no biological difference between the sexes and that strength will be buried in the middle of this, that he really, I really think that it was her, now that I'm thinking about, I've, I've, I've looked at it as like maybe she took it down with something, so I remember seeing it. I wish I'd saved, someone's got to save it somewhere. Someone on the Internet will be able to tweet to ass or something because it's so hilarious because it's so contrary to biology, just actual science. Everything she says is contrary to reality. I mean, she'll sit there and she'll pick out like, like the game hit man in her video she said something like, uh, you're incentivized to, to kill the woman then then stuff a body in the trunk and the footage she's using, she didn't take herself obviously and didn't credit whoever took it in the footage she's using.

Speaker 2:          00:27:32       You see the guy go up and kill the go and you see them lose points. I just don't know. That's a disincentive realization. You know, that they're not incentivizing you. They're saying penalizing you for this Anita Uj. I mean, I thought my very first video was two and Easter as well. You know, you very first in like July, 2013 and I ice the, the soulless started off because of her. We were inspired, well, kind of, but there was a lot of things that kind of, you know, that were going on. I was like, you know, I, I feel the need to say something just a, but apart from the quality being terrible, I'm bewildered at her. I listened to it the other day and I was just like, wow, I had no idea what was going on. And I was just like, look. And he said, I think you're just wrong on this.

Speaker 2:          00:28:14       I think you, I don't think you understand like the, there is a lot to this that you, you've left, you've left out. I should've said Cherry picked, but you know, and that's, that's something that's dogs are hell creek because that's all she's ever done. Her Christmas was terrible and everyone knows it. Nobody likes it because she's a divisive bitch and all she does is play the victim. She's got nothing she has nothing else does. As long as it's not talking about hurts specifically because we're, we're kind of beating her down here. But it's hard to think of anything genuinely good about her talking about her. I mean what I'm saying is about this, these ideas instead of concentrating on her as a person that had been debunked a million times all over the internet by everyone and their mother at this point. I do. I, well, why I want to get to what's interesting to me is like what is causes?

Speaker 2:          00:28:57       What causes these people to group up to these weird sort of echo chambers reiterating things that don't really work or make sense. Like there's no biological difference between men and women, especially when it comes to strength and then the tropes about video games and also like, here's the other thing, like when that Gamergate thing happened, yeah, it was, it was really fascinating to me that everybody wanted to absolutely. To lump people in one or two categories and the two categories of people that are appalled to it, appalled by it, and that think that, you know, sexism is a boren and all this stuff is terrible. And then the other people who supposedly if you, if you wanted some sexy images in video games, you had to be a piece of shit. Oh yeah. Like you sex negative feminists. Yeah. Well that it got into this weird category where people like, Hey, we don't want you meddling with, with art.

Speaker 2:          00:29:50       And whether it's a Frank Frazetta censoring it. Yeah. I mean, look, if you look at some of Frazetta stuff with the girls in the bikinis and familiar, but I mean how famous fantasy artists, oh well we sold like talking about like the [inaudible] earlier, beautifully painted. It's like these oil barbarians. It's a celebration of the human fizzy cause there's first perfect zenith. Yes. Yeah, yes. It's all Robert Howard's book on Conan. And frazetta was like the most famous of the, yeah it was. But it's very cartoonish depictions of women, you know, like with giant tits and Brian blood all over the place. And it's, it's silly. It doesn't make you hate women. That's what's gross. Like just like looking at Fabio and the cover of a romance novel doesn't mean you hate men. Yeah, right, right. In fact, it seems you're kind of lionizing and look, this is, this is the perfect depiction of what the artist wanted.

Speaker 2:          00:30:43       See like a man look like in a huge rippling hero carrying the median or whatever. But it becomes this weird thing when it's a man. People don't have a problem with it. No one says that. It demonizes the male figure and that you know that you have set these unnatural standards so you fucked with the self esteem of all these young men, but you absolutely have and the same way you do it with women like body shaming or you know, having ridiculous standards for bodies for females that works with men too. It's the same claims. Yeah, of course does. But they don't care because feminists dichotomize the world is women being oppressed and the oppressors and it's okay, take your oppressor. That's the, that's the root of old feminist tool. But that's why I want to talk about this in terms of the ideas because I think it's kind of the same thing as the right versus the left.

Speaker 2:          00:31:28       And I think it's all like a symptom of human psychology. The right versus the left is tribalism, tribalism. But so it's female versus male. It's, it's these, when you look at this blind allegiance towards anyone with a vagina, it's very similar to someone who was blind allegiance to is anyone who is in a red state. I mean that's true, but the, the people in the red site, do they say that the blue states were oppressing them? Oh yeah, absolutely. I'll do that for sure. Oh yeah. Well maybe it is. Hey Obama, he's a communist. He came from Kenya. He wants to ruin America. He wants to kill it from the inside. I mean, that was the big narrative forever. It's not them saying he's holding them down. Well, there was always like a thing that he was holding him down with the economy or that he was holding them down with obamacare and he was ruining so many different factors.

Speaker 2:          00:32:13       It takes in America, he hates America. It doesn't sound exactly the same to me because the, the, the feminists are essentially what was called Neo Marxist and they take the sort of Marxist dichotomy of the economy with the bourgeoisie personally proletariat through the American systems and their wealth and apply it to men being the bourgeoisie and women being the proletariat. Right. Which is highly ironic given the evidently privileged status in society. Women hold, well, that's when it got weird when everybody repeating that fucking wage gap thing. That was one of the most frustrating talking points. Even Obama, the Goddamn president of the United States on tv reiterating something that he knows is not true. Yeah, that was very frustrating. Yeah, because I just, I feel like human beings are inclined very naturally to form a group to stay tribal and then I think it works with, I think that is a part of what's happening, whether it's Neil Marxism that's collect connected to it or what, there's something that's happening with feminism versus masculine people.

Speaker 2:          00:33:11       Yeah. I'm an enemy, but there's no like masculinist so he's have to say masculine [inaudible] silly though. Yeah, that'd be funny. Yeah. This apparently a feminism is, what would you have mechanism that sounds dumb, doesn't it? And they're like, yeah, well then that's how feminism sounds to us. Well, it's the most amazing thing that it's taken so long for male feminists to die off. Like that's finally like rotting away after a few of them have been outed as being creepy. I was going to say that it's a honey. I mean, thank the baby Jesus. They got caught because look, man, there's nothing wrong with being male. And just because you're a human with a Dick doesn't mean you're a bad person if they think there's something wrong with being male, well, we only do because they want to fuck those girls and they don't have any other way to fuck us.

Speaker 2:          00:33:55       Well, I mean that's probably the roots of it, but that's 100% of the, ultimately you see male feminists, yes, they're going to win any fights. No, I know what I'm saying. They gonna do they even need to shave? Some of them do. They're going to be, they're going to be receding hairlines and Fedoras and they'll like molesting all over the place, Jordan, because instead of the best, he said they're sneaky. They had definitely not. But they're afraid. They're afraid of like men like you, you know they're never going to compete with you. Yeah, yeah. But they don't have to compete with themselves. That's what they don't see that right away. They got fucked by genetic, some of them love and got fucked by genetics and so they're taking the only evolutionary strategy they've got. You can hardly blame him but they need to do is get to the lab and figure out crisper.

Speaker 2:          00:34:33       We're work on re reengineering yourself to look like for the fucking gym. That's what they to do. Seriously. If you're a male feminist, just shut up. Stop talking about feminism on the Internet. Look at yourself going to die. It got on the gym and in a couple of years time you'll be a bit bigger. You'll be a bit, if she's five foot one and you weigh 80 pounds on us, you're fucked. Keep eating sprouts. I've got, I've got a friend, he's a quite short guy. Do you know what he did? He did. Muslim is a nippy little guy and he's quite strong in nippy. Yeah, no, you can get around. He can get around. He's an amazing that we got to like a boulder climbing. He's amazing at it. You would not believe how unbelievable his, his, his girlfriend is so attractive I believe here and he's so self confident. I should host a seminar mean this is how I did it. Yeah, he should. It's just self improvement. You will kill yourself and then things work out for you. That, I mean, absolutely think that that's a good thing. Absolutely. But I understand the motivation wipe someone becomes a male feminist. [inaudible] the word allies, one of my favorite ally, ally, I just love that they are now synonymous with creepy harasser. Well,

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       you kind of knew it all from the beginning that that was what it was going on. Everybody knew it. Like especially heterosexual men. You're like, I know what you're doing. You fucking weasel. You know you're putting women above all else. One guy read his twitter profile and he was talking about, he goes, oh, oh, in his twitter post. Rather he said, I'm going to stop calling myself a feminist until feminists decide that I'm doing feminism right. I'll make women respect you. But the fact that he put it out on twitter like you, you put that at like, this is just like this giant white flag. It's, Oh yeah. That's the thing. You know, people in general, women being people respect boundaries. There's the people who will enforce her own boundaries. This guy's literally said, hey, I have no boundaries. You tell me what to do, I'll be a slave.

Speaker 1:          00:36:20       No one's going to respect that. You know, I'll be a willing servant and keep showing. And there was just finding nice Douche bag, you have to say, I'm going to stop saying I'm a feminist until feminists telling me I'm doing feminism. Right. There's a reason that they call them cooks. What does, it's a good word. It is. That's a good word to know what it meant. I thought it always meant like a cock hold like a porn film. I mean, you kinda did originally, but now it's just kind of being someone who wants to end up themselves. Yeah. And that's really good use for it. Well, it's also subtle. It's not just someone who won't stand up for themselves. Someone who is pandering. Well yeah, like you're pandering to the laughter pant. You're trying to paint yourself out as being very sort of hoping that the person you're selling yourself out.

Speaker 1:          00:37:02       So we'll treat you linearly. See, so instead of talking about individuals, what I'm, what I'm really fascinated about is the psychology behind what's going on now in this culture of free expression. Yeah. The fact that a guy like you can not see anything wrong with you, but I mean the guy was just a gentleman from England who doesn't have a connection to the media owner can just by virtue of your ability to communicate and put out some youtube videos and have some really good points, you can have this massive, massive following. This is an n the these ideas that people are spreading back and forth. Even the weird ones like the Kec Stan, the frog and all that shit. It's just a Jag, but it's interesting to me. It's interesting to see what happened. Like, like what, what I feel like is like Fox News and CNN and even major networks when especially all the ones that are trying to portray narratives.

Speaker 1:          00:37:55       All the ones that are talking about the way life is and you know, they seem to me to be like these, these huddled up executives at the top of like a giant pile of crocodiles snapping at them. It's like they've completely lost control over what people talk about. They were on the spire of rock and it's the oceans slowly eroding. It's snapping. It was nothing there. There was no water, there was no crocodiles. The only information that got away, I mean that was the only information got out, was through mass media. Mass media was controlled by corporations and we like for the

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       longest time, that was the only way. And they still operate like that's the only way. It's really quite fascinating narrative. Hedger mooney social media has demolished them and we're not going back. No, this is not going back. It's not going back. And the, I think the only companies that truly understand that or uh, Internet based companies that are trying to manage it, like whether it's youtube or google or even Netflix, yeah, they understand it, but you know, they're trying to manage it in some weird ways that like, I'm really bummed out about Netflix. Thumbs up versus thumbs down. Like what do you know what you should have? You should have 100% thing. So give them one to a hundred the more, more range you give someone, the better. But up and down, it's just fucking silly. If I were going to review things, oh, do it.

Speaker 2:          00:39:22       Recommended not recommended and it would be quite subjective to my personal taste. It, it'll be able to see, look, if you've been following me for awhile, you know what I like and I'd give my reasons. And I tried to explain it as accurately and concisely and as objective as I could. So the, the, the, the largest sweep of people watching the video could understand why I felt the way I did. And so the end of [inaudible] would, would I recommend it? Yeah. And you know, your mileage may vary or yeah, you've got to watch this or something like that, you know, but I, I hate the star system. It's like, wow. I mean, you know, it's, it's, it makes it sound objective when it's not really, you know, sometimes it's objective, you know what I mean? It can be, I mean, he's not perfect though. I agree with you.

Speaker 2:          00:39:58       It, again, with a lot of this little stuff, it's about aesthetics and tastes. So for sure, I mean, I loved the movie hardcore Henry. I mean, I, I like, and I realized that I irrationally love this note was the single person who had the first, first person. Yeah, there was a lot about it. I've said that. Oh, you'll love it. And I'm sure like it looks like guy like crazy, but it's, it's not for everyone. It's for, it's for the sort of guy. He's got a lizard brain who likes violence, lizard brain. That's what you think about me. You were an MMA fighter. I'm a fighter. I kickbox I did taekwondo and there was no mma when I was okay. But did you enjoy finding other people? Um, that's a very complicated question obviously. I know. And did you enjoy for many years? So I know, I mean it's complicated in that I did, it was important for me, but I don't necessarily know if I enjoyed it.

Speaker 2:          00:40:49       I definitely enjoyed winning. But uh, it is, uh, it was such a like how call him, it was a task, you know, you'll like it when you get, when you get past the sort of, uh, maybe the beginning of it is more shaking the rest of it. But, um, when you get past the initial sort of, this is weird to look at, you'll, it, it's fast paced, it's action packed, and it definitely taps into that sort of lizard brain, whether it's the male desire to fight this guy at the end of the film that he's, he's literally in like a fist brawl with like 30 other dudes and it's, it's the most insane and he's just, you know, it's all coming at him and he's just Bam, Bam, Bam. It's how get, get stoned and watch it and get drunk or watches. It's just the best thing if you're into that sort of thing. But if you're not into that, you weren't like it at all. You wouldn't anytime an inch that

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       like, I like John Wick, he's not always, you know, but like, you know, John Wick two, how about that? I've never, it wasn't even that good. But, uh, the, you know, it's, it's for a certain kind of person in a certain kind of mood, but when it hits, right, I mean it was the first film in a long, long time that I was just sat in the cinema, just enjoy it with a smile on my face. I was just enjoying this. This was great fun, you know. But I, I presented it, it was just like tapping into the primordial desire to defeat your enemies. I just thought it was interesting. They shot at like a video game, like quake, first person shooter and stuffing. So this vidcon thing that you went to, who puts this together? Hank and John Green. And who are they? The vlog brothers. They're famous youtubers.

Speaker 3:          00:42:16       And uh, I find it very interesting when Anita was calling me a shithead and garbage human, that's a direct violation of that code of conduct. And did they do anything about it? No. I know because she's a feminist because she's a woman. Oh. Because she gets special cause she's in, he suck. He's in because she gets special treatment because at this point she's basically become the avatar feminism. If she fails, I swear to God in that. But I mean she respected in that world. No, no, no. Everyone hates her. Why did they still prop her up? Because she's an, he's in. If she doesn't make any sense, why don't, I mean, well, there's a myth os that's built up around her and get word. Yes. It's um, and they've all propped her up. They've all propped her up level, said good things about her. They've all defended her.

Speaker 3:          00:43:05       And if it turns out that she is in fact an abuser, which she did according to the Vidcon code of conduct, which, what is the code of conduct? Oh, I, I can't remember it verbatim, but I read down a video. Uh, it's one of my latest videos. Um, it was just a quick message to hank and John Green and a, I know that thousands of people email them saying, hey look, she did violate your code of conduct from a position of institutional privilege at Vidcon. She was on the panel. I didn't have a microphone. She had a microphone, she's calling me names, she's accusing me of things on true. She, and she was doing that while you were in the audience directly looking me in the eye and it was like, okay, that's fine, but uh, that's not right. And they've done nothing. They have done nothing.

Speaker 3:          00:43:45       They've said nothing. You talk. And then afterwards, all I got from her fans and, and I mean like, you know, hundreds and hundreds of messages and I just retweeted them all night with exactly the same language she uses when she's displaying. I'll look of the nasty messages I'm guessing of people calling me eight garbage human, which is what she called me. And so she has done absolutely nothing different. And so I said, right, hank and John, she's violated your code of conduct. Her fans, she's incited a submodel of harasses exactly as she claims I do. But she has actually done this. Then on the Saturday, she was due to be on a panel about cyber harassment c but it can't be harassment when she's a woman and you're a man because you are the oppressor. So it's the same thing as racism and the black person being raised against a white person.

Speaker 3:          00:44:37       It possible. The only reason to do this then to not to take no action is if you are highly ideological and interesting. So you feel like they're high Dhea. Highly ideological. Yeah. Incredibly biased. But why are they, if they're youtube stars, I mean aren't they like don't they understand? They're very progressive, very progressive. But you're fairly progressive too. I'm a liberal. I'm not progressing. What is the difference between a liberal, a liberal and progressive ones? Quality of outcome, quality of outcomes, complete night and day. It really drives what the problem with liberals and progressives. Wow. This is by definition is that I've always thought progressive means that you support gay rights, you support a women's right comes forth. That's the outcome of gays. With non gays, they won't case that non games we case to have the same. I said, no, I'm done the wrong. I want that too.

Speaker 3:          00:45:24       And this is what I was gonna say. There's a lot of open overlapping magisterial when it comes to these things. For example, they're great word magisterium and I'm getting, never heard that before. [inaudible] use that. Areas of interest, things that they won't have domains. The worry of sounds so much better than areas of interest though. So write that down. Jamie. What's going to start? I'm sorry to use that one. Magistarium oh, so glad I'm giving you something. Yeah. So yeah, basically, you know, liberal, there's no real argument against uh, gay rights from a liberal perspective. Cause liberals want universal rights. Of course, if some people can get married, gay should be up to get married. So it's the argument, Oh, I'm Christine get fucked. I'm an atheist, not argument. Right? Where's the progressive they wanted because someone else has it. Someone else has this, therefore they want this because they want.

Speaker 3:          00:46:03       And then whose definition by there's a yours a year defining them. That's what they define as, you know, they are the ones saying all this. I mean like affirmative action is the uh, or example of this. A liberal would never ask for FM to action because in the liberal worldview people should be free to pursue their own goals. Now, I mean the liberals and usually very anti racist. That's not a, that's not a cancer in which you would judge someone him sex. You know, I would never turn around and say, right, okay well you'll see these were the kid. I mean, you know, you clean know what you're doing, but you've got some tents so get out. You know, that would be ridiculous. You know what, that's not a, not a reason to do that. Um, but the progressive we'll do that. If you're a man, the progressive will say, well I'm sorry, we've got, you know, we want equality and this is, this is what we define a quality of different years.

Speaker 3:          00:46:48       I call it equality of opportunity. They call it quality of outcome. Cause they'll turn around and say, well, you know what, we've already got like a 70% men. So I mean you'll see you might be great but you've got a deck so we can't take you. We're going to take that unqualified woman instead because we need to get to parity because they want a quality of outcome. There were 50% men, 50% women. I have a friend who was a, a big wig at a big internet company and they had to deal with that shit all the time, where going to have men who were far more qualified, who they were getting pressured of push out to make room for my, like they were specifically looking for qualified black woman. They were like going out of their way because they wanted to give out the appearance of diversity. Exactly. But that's because they're also scared of criticism. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       So they're scared of being attacked for the of activists and by race pimps and there's there, there are a lot of race pimps, which is like Drm, race, Penn Plaza. Yeah. It's not mine. It's, they use it for Jesse Jackson back in the day. It's a good time. And he's been outed as a race pamper. I mean they've talked to people's, like famously come to organizations and said, I am going to give you diversity courses and you're going to pay me a certain amount of money or we're going to protest to the religion, isn't it? And they're in the priesthood. Well, it's people who like criticized and they don't want it to hurt their business. And when you get fun, especially if you're dealing with an internet business, Internet based businesses, you know like, like, like Google for example, apple, classically liberal, right? You would say bluegrass. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:48:17       So very loving in in England, liberal actually means and liberal in, in the United States, liberal means progressive. Well though I hate all these fucking arms is a nightmare. It's taken me a long time to really be able to hammer out the, you know, the ins and outs ideologically of it. And so I can explain it quite efficiently now because it's difficult. It's really dark about something like progressive thinking into, well not progressive thinking, but rather affirmative action is that you're going to create a certain amount of racism by putting someone who's qualified in a position just because of their color in it is racist. You're, you're, you're being discriminatory on the basis of race white person. Yeah. That's racism by a racist. But you go to the deep root of it and you've got to realize, well there's some people that just, they're, they're given a terrible hand of cards.

Speaker 2:          00:49:07       We've got to be able to figure out how to fix that hand of cards, how to make it a little bit more balanced in our, in our cities. How to make, how do you do that? I, that's a good question. There's one way to do it, but that's where it gets really crazy, doesn't it? I don't know about that. But if the people that are born in these crime ridden communities and then get no assistance whatsoever from the very government that sending billions of dollars overseas to assist these other cops helping them. Absolutely. Not against helping him. I mean like the, you know, I'm not saying you know what you go hang out. So you know, but anything you do has to start with them saying, I want to change. Sure. And if they can't stop the, if that's not damaged, they're going to start with, then you can do nothing for them.

Speaker 2:          00:49:51       Well, they're happy where they on how they are right now. Then you can't change anything. All you'll do is throw good money off the bat and they'll know it that, I mean like think about people who win the lottery. Did they, are they happy? Some of them, most days they ruins our lives, doesn't it? That's what they say. Relationships feel like the people who write those articles are always sad. They didn't run the lottery. So maybe you could talk to shit. I think there's probably a lot of dudes out there that are just straight ball and having a great time. It's a new thing that you will have value. I don't know if that's always true. Most of the time it is. I think it takes 100 person and it may me if it's like a super amount of money, what you, maybe you just got to ease into it.

Speaker 2:          00:50:27       Maybe it's one of those things and she went $100 million and you just like, pretend you only want a hundred grand spend that. But uh, I got to start slow. Don't get a Ferrari. I'm not saying we don't have a Camaro, you know, you got to help these people. But they have to, you have to begin from a position where they say, you know what, look, I want to help because if, if there's something going, I don't want to change, well then they're not going to change. But I understand that. But I meet a lot of them change, don't even understand how they would go about changing. And they're constantly surrounded and reinforced by all these people around them that are in jail or committing crimes. Black Youtube is occasionally in, a lot of them are like, you know, they do blame a lot of stuff on the white man.

Speaker 2:          00:51:05       They said the white man will keep you down and stuff like that. That's, it's not, listen, if this was a white guy and he was at the Black Man's, hold me down, you'd be like, shut up, shut up. You wouldn't accept it. And if you'll get to accept that from them, that's you being a racist. Treat them like you would treat white people. If this was white people sitting around going, I'm not gonna do anything. I'm going to join the gang. I think what the black man's, all the Jews are trying to hold me down and something. Yeah, you didn't let me finish. I wasn't saying that white people are in fact holding black people down. I was saying that idea of the white man, like they have this mandate, we've got to hold the black people sound probably dressed. That's all right. It's a standard argument.

Speaker 2:          00:51:41       I don't think there's a coalition of, I know, I mean without, in the hedge. Yeah. It's a sad thought. This option. I think that there absolutely was certain times, I mean there's absolutely neighborhoods at black people were not allowed to buy real estate. There's absolutely a systematic racism and there was still a little racist around, you know, I'm not, I'm not saying it's not justified. That's the thing, right? I'm not saying it's not justified and that's, I think that, I think that's where like the argument goes off the rails because they go, what do you mean all this stuff's happening. Yeah, it has happened and they're all racist, but you don't have to let that hold you back. No, you definitely don't. That is up to it. Yeah, I think they need examples. You know, I think more examples and more role models in that direction.

Speaker 2:          00:52:20       I've actually, I've seen, I can't remember the guy's name, but I remember seeing this, uh, of this black doctor doing a speaking tour at, um, was he a real doctor or a chiropractor? Then all of the differences then chiropractors aren't really, doctors just found that out recent. Really? Oh it's real. Oh yeah. They don't go to medical school. Yeah. And that fucking crazy. I didn't know about that until I'm having her on the podcast. The woman who wrote that article, dude, they kill people died from that and they died. There was some recent thing that a red band sent me about some playboy playmate who died because the doctor or the chiropractor adjusted her neck and she fucking died. Fuck. People die every year. They do it to babies, man. They had just babies. There's people that do like chiropractic adjustments on babies. Their bones aren't even fully formed. Their bones are soft and these assholes are manipulating them. I'm really glad you told me that. Cause I got two and a half year old son. I mean nothing wrong. Playboy model, Katie May's death caused by chiropractor. Autopsy fines. Scroll up so I could read that. Fucking this nonsense. I thought they were doctors. I thought when a doctor tells

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       me, yeah, when you say Doctor Mike, I thought it was a doctor who died. You went to medical school and learned how to be a chiropractor. No, I can't believe you're allowed to do and don't settle down. Ready for this. The guy who invented it was a magnetic healer. Okay. The guy invented Cairo. The, there's all this like subluxation is all these words they use. They have cleared a total. Yes. Entirely fake. Not only that, but the guy who invented it very possibly was murdered by his son. That's a suspicion. His son ran him over for sure and they think he might've done it on purpose and then his son ran him over with a car and then took over the business and his son was totally shady. Pieces of shit. We'll call it a fraud. Well, you could have been an accident, a tragic accident and the love dad, but the allegation is that he ran over his dad to take over the family business.

Speaker 1:          00:54:11       It is not real at all and that is not a real science. There's no science to support it. There's no it's, but the crazy thing is it's so accepted that insurance pays for this shit. She had some clotting and went to the hospital where they tried to do super cheap procedures, but she passed away. So this guy adjusting her her neck and they tore her verbal, her vertebral artery. Did you haven't look ahead local. So no man, when you're adjusting you, you to understand there's bones in there and as violent jutting if you're a tender person or if you have some sort of vulnerability. Yeah, model. They tore her fucking article or artery rather than article and subsequently cut off blood flow to her brain. Her death was ruled accidental. What in the fuck can we, can we, can we give these people stopped somehow scared.

Speaker 1:          00:55:03       If a doctor does is this is what confuses the shit out of him. All these guys that have called themselves doctor. When I talked to them, I thought they were an actual fucking doctor. Like I went to a place like this is doctor Pete docter. Pete's going to work on you, Doctor Pete's. Dot. A fucking doctor. You mean? It's a 100% fake. The what is the article? Pull up that article like chiropractors are bullshit because I want to give that lady prop. She's going to come on my podcast. Oh, so she's a, she calls herself the science base. Yvette. The science babe, don't she has the PSI babe. She sounds awesome. Uh, yes. Pro-Science I'm very excited. Very excited to have on the article was, uh, it was actually synchronicity because it was a conversation that I was having with Steve Rinella as a friend of mine a couple of weeks ago when he was talking about, uh, his brother has got some issue with atrophy and have his arm.

Speaker 1:          00:55:54       He's been going to a chiropractor. And I said, I think chiropractors are bullshit. And so after the podcast, I smoked a joint and I was thinking about what it was. I being too hard on Chiropractors, I'd be in a deck. So then I started researching chiropractors. Yeah. And I found all this crazy shit about the fucking magnetic healers and all this stuff. Here's the article. Chiropractors are bullshit. You shouldn't trust him with your spine or any other part of your body. And what is her name that she wrote this. So we can give her some how do events, Yvette. And here we go d at Tremont

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       in Trimont. It's d apostrophe capital, a low, low level d. What does his bullshit, not American spelling or possibly Canadian Quebec call. Hello? Lowercase d apostrophe large capital. I'm in favor of banning French as well. I like French people. None of the language. The food. Do you know the French? But we could bang up. Sounds good. If there's, there's one accepted form of bigotry in England. This is against the French. So fuck French. Oh really? Oh, you're allowed to? Yeah. How come you can do that? Because we lost the hundred years war. Uh, so it's an England thing. Yeah. We spent a hundred years kicking the shit out of French and then God intervened to save. Yeah. Frances having a Ho well you haven't let me finish this. Talk about the doctor cause it basically like I know that they're there. They were probably gonna be a lot of blind people who sat there going, well holy shit, my whole life I've been like, I know that the white man's keeping me down and stuff like that, but this is, this isn't all coming from me.

Speaker 3:          00:57:19       That's the thing. I'm not the fucking expert here. This is coming. I wish I could remember this guy's name. It was like a couple of years ago I watched this guy doing the speaking tour and he, he was, um, a black doctor, but he's like a phd in business studies or something like that. It wasn't like, you know, even though a chiropractor, um, but he, I was, I was, I was absolutely loving his speech to a bunch of kids in school cause he was just saying, look, if you drop outs, you won't get to where you want to go. I mean, you've got to look at it. Just look at sensible. You just look at it through in like an Aristotelian Lens. You are what you do. Okay, what do you want? Where do you want to end up? You will end up as a scientist. Okay, well if you drop out of school, that's that goal off the table.

Speaker 3:          00:57:57       You can't just have a scientist by training at school. So no matter how much you hate school, you just got to fucking stick it out. You've got to get, you want to do something that's involved. If you want to get, if you want to get their scientists, so you plot it on, get her. Okay, so I've got to get to college and go to know university, get phd. Then I've got to make sure that I've, you know, I've done all the right courses to get to the right field. You've got to plot the sale. If you drop out at any point. Well, there we go. That's, you screwed your life plan there. So you're going to have to figure out something to do know. I know because I did exactly the same thing. There's just no getting around it. No one can. No one can give that to you.

Speaker 3:          00:58:26       You've got to give it to yourself. That's what empowerment is. If you want to be empowered, you've just got to go, you know what? Let's, let's just assume the white man hate shit. Let's just assume he does. Every white men just assume we're all fucking racist. Why would you assume that? That gets a foolish thing to, sorry. This is worst case stone. Let's think about worst case scenario. Every one person's racist. They won't hold you back, but legally they can't. So you might be thinking, where I came, I was going to be some bigotry, so well you can do, you're going to work harder. That's the only way you can do. If you get what if you want to get to where you got to go, you've got to work kind of living in a paranoid world where you're done, I want person hates you. I'm not suggesting shot really even at hand. I'm not suggesting you should actually do that. Well, I didn't bring it up because that's the worst case scenario for them. That's the, that's what let's say the White Man's trying to hold me back. Okay. Let's see. Yes, let's just take that as a premise. Right. Okay. But does he actually, you know, he's not, I mean they do actually have affirmative action for your university and stuff. So even if we still assume that this is somehow owe him being racist and hating

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       black people, you can still go, well I can still take advantage of that. If what I need is these grades in the subjects go and get those grades in those subjects. In fact Yuma thing. Well Christ, I'm actually good for the great up just in case the white man tries to screw me even harder. You know, I'm going to work even harder. You think? Well Christ that means you got to work hard. Yeah. You've got to work hard. I love the term the white man is, if they're usually white man, the white man, they, they're not unified in anything other than keeping black people down. Like there's people brother down. Cause you know, I mean like when he gets to the presidency clearly are like in dispute over everything. Yeah. Like everything from top to bottom, didn't the new center, but it's the new thing that keeps getting the woke centrists the centrists, the new center, the, the extremes of cancer and we should just ignore them.

Speaker 2:          01:00:06       Yeah. Well that's the center. Sounds ridiculous to every, it all sounds ridiculous, but ask yourself, would you rather towards the bench Pero of Richard Spencer Bench Bureau. Exactly. We'd rather talk to me or need suck. He's in. Well maybe not need somebody to talk to her. Okay. She's bad example route me or someone who says that, you know, all white people oppressing our black people. I always want to talk to someone who like has these extreme beliefs. Like I believe she doesn't mean people that go on. I want to know like what goes on in her head. I want to know why she thinks that there's something wrong with being mailed to the point where like every male has toxic. I mean I'm talking about for the plug political candidates, you know, would you rather, would you rather have two people who are relatively moderate, relatively close to the center you're talking about political candidates took, yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:00:53       Sorry, I should specified you get there. Well, because that's the, the whole, the, the center is the political sphere is it? I see. I feel like it's an ideology more than it is a political, how you live your life more than how you vote. Yeah. It's not like a, an ideology in and of itself and you've got like center left center, right? They've got similar but different ideological traditions and I mean it's like it's basically the, the problem is when you say it's someone else's fault, that's the worst thing you can do because you're disempowering yourself. Except when it clearly is someone else's. Sometimes it is. Sometimes it does, but most of the time it's not. Most of the time it's your own fault. Yeah. Like the victim mentality that you were talking about when we're talking about like hardcore feminists that are constantly blame men for thing.

Speaker 2:          01:01:33       But the problem is like what is it like being a chick? It's probably fucking terrible. It's probably, and not always, I mean in the terms when the term that you didn't let me finish. Fuck. What I'm saying is when women are constantly worried about being victims, right? Like women are worried. Yeah. You show him. Yeah. I've talked to some that talked about like driving home, they're scared. They get nervous when they're walking into certain areas at night. And the way that a man doesn't. This is interesting cause that's the same opinion that Saudi Arabians, half of the West, the house would you mean you've given me the feminist narrative that all women are constantly afraid of men? No, I think a lot of women are though. But I'm not saying they're not, but like you know, let you know when you say right, the other women talk to women are afraid of men.

Speaker 2:          01:02:16       That's also a feminist narrative. That's also the Wahhabi narrative from Saudi Arabia. And that's why they have to go, well that means all women aren't allowed out and they go wet burgers. They can't. They've got to reflect. We become invisible. So I men aren't going to predict. We have a very ancient culture and in that culture, women are treated ridiculously different than what you need. They don't Wahhabism arrived in the 18th century with Abdul Wahab. Uh, an old 1700. That's pretty ancient to an American. Yeah. And not to anyone. I'm American man. Okay. But I'm not a snitch culture. My point is old as fuck. My point is, okay, the point 1776. Yeah, exactly. Is this, none of this was what like 17, 18 or something like that. But see it's older by four years. This country is older. By four years, country exist. Not the full 70, 76. It just wasn't worth nothing I'm saying existed. It's the same people here, a bunch of fucking campers hundreds of years before that. Like the people that walk the Appalachian trail. I have so many, but this is way newer and way more cancerous as well. There's a lot of great stuff about point being there is a very different classification of women versus men in, in Wahhabi Islam. Right? It's the same theory behind it. They say exactly the same woods. What do you mean?

Speaker 2:          01:03:32       Yeah. But some women are, I mean like in certain circumstances, what I'm trying to get at is that the way women think about men, it's very different than the way men think about women. A man does not walk to a group of women and worry about being raped. A man does not walk through the streets at night and worry. Some woman's going to come out of the darkness and grab his ass, but a woman doesn't walk into a courthouse, a divorce proceeding and think, I'm gonna lose everything. That's true. That's true. Unless you're Roseanne and you're dating Tom Arnold, right? Boom. She's still paying that again, one for the team, except for that one exception that proves the rule. Then 90% of the time, the woman, I mean not, I mean you, you hit horrific. So he told some of the, you get some horror stories where, I mean the women's men's rights activists, I know these terms, I'm immersed in it all day, but people aren't.

Speaker 2:          01:04:19       They listen, people that have listened to us, a lot of them are not getting your ass off the sofa. Stop watching tv or go online and just be immersed in that world. Now go outside. No. Why? You don't have to be an, you don't have to be knowing that Mra thousands of pounds to come here to tell you what an MRI. The other thing is this thing, right? This is, this is on the, I say this with the greatest respect from the more venerable generations, the mine who are more used to the television. People don't watch TV anymore and they won't get back to it. Yeah, I think you're right. I think it's dying and we've got the statistics to prove it. I've done videos on it. We've got all the stuff, the sources in the stats. It's only the older generations. I mean like in Britain, all of the TV channels, channel full was the young hip, cool TV channel when I was young, the average age of the vns 44 well, once they found out that old dude had been fucking kids for all those years, Jimmy savile think that lost a lot of faith.

Speaker 2:          01:05:11       That's not the reason there's TV watching. This isn't, that's not the reason. The reason is it's not the real Jesus Christ. Sorry, sorry. Yeah. You got to say, I've been dealing with some people who were fucking idiots. I get it. You know, and I've, I've had to be like really, really specific because they were there. There was a group of people online who know that I'm right and they don't like that I'm right. They don't like you. Right? Oh No, they hate that. I'm right. We're talking about Anita Sarkeesian again, have fun. They hate me and I don't want to give them anymore ammunition. Nice. Sorry. Bad that she's not defending herself or she doesn't have the opportunity to, she when she, when she called me a piece of shit in the garbage human, I had said nothing up until that point. She yelled back, I just want to talk.

Speaker 2:          01:05:50       And she was like, oh, whatever dude. And it's just like I came all this way to hear what you had to say and all you could do is insult me. That was the rehash this Jesus Christ. It's a, I've been personally slighted. I get it. No, I mean, I think I'm being defamed all across the Internet now. There's a, there's a narrative going around the progressive journalists. Those already been debunked by an actual journalist called Tim Pool. And the video evidence of the event that I personally took that the ice storm, the stage and started screaming abuse. Or they're saying that they'll probably, who was saying that journalists and like the journalists like pull up of an actual artwork. Tell me an actual article that said there probably aren't any yet, but I bet you tomorrow or going on there articles about me and some of them will say something like, I abused her.

Speaker 2:          01:06:37       Pause some hobbies and pause. Do you not understand the irony of, we're talking about people labeling themselves as victims and you are labeling yourself as victim of a crime that has not occurred. No. I'm talking about articles that are being written by journalists and videos that are being made, but they have not been made yet. And then you're saying just watch. They're going to be made. Yeah, but unless, cause I've been doing this red. Okay. Do you not see it? Come on. You gotta be able to see that a little bit. I mean like I'm not like a victim. This is something that happened to me. But do you get that you, we're just talking about right here. Who is saying that you were stormed, that you stormed the stage and you tell me journalists and I say, where are these articles? And you say, just wait and watch the moment.

Speaker 2:          01:07:19       At the moment we're talking about like rumors, you know, for example, like a it tim pool said that a friend of his, I think she's an actress, but you know it's, it's the same sort of, okay, but that's a la circles. That's someone gossiping. Right? That doesn't mean that someone actually, a journalist wrote an article about the half storming the staff. How do you, why do you think they would social media? Why would you even concentrate on that if it has not occurred? I mean, isn't this sort of like a little black guy complaining about the man holding you back when there is no man holding you back? I don't think it's analogous. I mean it is. You're talking about being a victim of a crime that hasn't occurred. No, but I knew what these people are like up in dealing with them for long enough.

Speaker 2:          01:07:57       Now I know what those white people are like, man, I've been dealing with them my whole life. Yeah. But when we actually have a precedent for them doing this as well. Right. But they're not doing it right now. And you're saying they are, they are their own social media right now. I mean like you go like generalists like Ian Miles Chung who said, right. So the prevailing narrative among journalists at the moment is that song gone stone stage and abused. The knees suck. He's in one video. Evidence says the exact, this is something that she posted online. Yeah, he posted, there's no articles, but there is a twitter, you can tell that it's coming up there at gun towers and then it was brewing and this, and this is how these rumors start. And then someone starts reporting it and then suddenly you get a narrative going on.

Speaker 2:          01:08:32       I mean, and I'm a victim of this because I've got a large enough reach to be able to say let's switch the video. Cause I think people listening to this who have no idea who the fuck I need to start teasing is and don't even know who you are. They like there's a lot of people listening to this. I would like to get to more interesting things. Hmm. Okay. Cause I say you're an interesting guy. I said look your, you were a little wrapped up in this right now, which is okay, I'm at the center. I'll tell you what it was. But you're a very smart guy and your videos are excellent. You know, and you're a punk house of grain. Thanks. I'm, I can't wait to Russ. Who's Russ? Your friend. Yeah, he's a huge fan of goes rusty's fanny. I kind of wait to see you do like now that you have this gigantic audience, do you feel certain amount of responsibility, but it was half intellectual integrity is the most important thing.

Speaker 2:          01:09:19       And the great thing about this and the great thing about the way the Internet works is that, I mean, look at the, look at the people who are at the top look like something like Cutie Pie, man of outstanding moral character. He who know him. Do you hang with them? I've spoken to him a few times, but I don't need to hang with them tonight. Look at what he does. He doesn't go around bullying people. Doesn't go around lying about people, right? Doesn't he does, you guys aren't doing charity and being like, Hey Bros, you know, and being nice to people and being inspiration. What happened with him? Can you, would you know that? Okay, well let's, let's, let's go over the actual, this is, by the way, this is affected me. It affected a lot of youtube people where their youtube videos used to have, um, much freer monetization.

Speaker 2:          01:09:59       Meaning that for people listening, say if Sargon puts out a youtube video, you could have ads on that youtube video and your youtube videos get a lot of downloads. Man. I mean, it would be very lucrative for you. And then with us, our youtube money was cut by more than 60% I think to retain 40% of your income was pretty good as well. Yeah. Well the anything controversial, anything having to do with anything right wing is deemed not not friendly for advertising. Anything that has drugs in the title is deemed not friendly for advertising. It's like we've literally been able to change the title of things and re upload them and then they ads they that balls just so the same content. So what all this came from is pooty pie who has an enormous youtube presence, right? Doesn't he have like 50 million followers? Right.

Speaker 2:          01:11:00       Holy Shit. And he made some videos that the, what is it, the Washington Post? Cause I would, it wasn't Wall Street Journal. Wall Street Journal. Can I tell you about it? Please do. Please do. Because you, I'm sure much did. I did a bunch of videos on this and it was the funniest thing in the world. I love the language they use as well. What's a scoop? A scoop is a news story that other people are not aware of yet. And can you sign it? You got it first. So if, uh, if tens of millions of people have seen something and then if I'm a Wall Street journalist and I come along and I find something with tens of millions of people have seen, can I rightly call that a scoop? Well, you can definitely call it a news story and you could definitely say that people in see that. This goes back to what we were talking about before, whereas they have a hierarchy of viewership.

Speaker 2:          01:11:49       Like what? What is, what is a, a real network? What does a real newspaper, what is real journalism like in their mind, I'm sure the Wall Street Journal considers themselves to be in the hierarchy versus someone who has helped, but they don't have 55 million downloads. They don't, I mean, there's no way if the w if no, it's a street journal puts out a video of a million. Yeah. If they put out a video, if they got a vit, a million hits on their video, that would be a big deal. Yeah, that'd be thrilled. If pewdie pie, how only a million hits, I'm one, it'd be super depressed. He is a much bigger entity than them, but in their mind, like a scoop is them the legitimate media. So pointing out something in the illegitimate, this new weird, the city logos, fear. So basically pd pie, he's a comedian and he makes jokes, but he's uh, like I said, he's a man of good character and he's parents should be thanking Pewdie Pie for being the person he is because he's talking to their kids and their kids are gonna grow up being decent people because of his influence.

Speaker 2:          01:12:51       But the Wall Street Journal, Ben Fritz and Rolfe Winkler clan, there was another one, I can't remember his name at the moment. They decided what they were going to do is, and I don't know who put them up to this obviously, but uh, they were going to watch about six months of his video, go through and find any antisemitic jokes that he had made. Well, I mean by definition is a joke. So there's not six months. Yeah, six, eight. They sat together a video every day and they got about and like two minutes of footage or something with him making jokes at the expense of the Nazis effectively and they were like, wow, this guy's promoting antisemitism to see those jokes. Cause I've heard about them. I don't know the actual jokes that he said that they were saying, but, but, but here's the point. Let's get to it. They were saying that he is making light of being a Nazi or pretending to be a Nazi and that this is what's fucked up. Like he was promoting antisemitism by parodying. The Nazis tried to explain to people is that it's Hogan's heroes work. There isn't a mel brooks a bit. Yeah, bit of an old antique Jesus Christ. He must be, oh God. Just so you know. Yeah. I mean springtime for Hitler you could say was somehow or another humanizing. I imagine it created a lot of Nazis can imagine if somebody made the argument that Mel Gibson created Nazis. That's how far we've come. Mel Brooks, Mel Brooks, what'd I say? Mel Gibson. Yeah, he my website today.

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       That was clearly a fraud. He had only ever think about when someone says Mel Gibson drunk. I think of him yelling about Jews and cops. That's all I a big bid. And everything's crazy. Fucking Jews. Jesus smells the smell

Speaker 2:          01:14:29       poster boy, right? Yeah. Well he is. Well, he's a serious like nine 11 conspiracies the lever and yeah, where's that Charlie Sheen, I'll probably lumping them together, but he got my pain. The, these, these videos. I'm, one of them was the funniest thing because they were taking, and the, you know, the jokes were like, you know, like I'm there like 20 seconds of joke taken out like a 10 minute video, you know, where he's just, it's just like a cutaway skipped, uh, you know, Wah Wah Wah. I'm like, you know, one of them was a joke about how the media takes his jokes out of context to try and frame him as something new. And they cut that out of context and used it and it was just like, well, there it is. Which is amazing. It's incredible. It's amazing that they had the balls to do it and they would, they would not only proud of what they did.

Speaker 2:          01:15:16       They called it a scoop and then they went to advertisers and said, look at this hate speech, but how do they get away with doing that? How did they go and collect them too? How come no one from the Wall Street Journal sat them down and said, well listen, this is definitely not him saying that you're going to take something out of context and then doing it. Is it because of it is and then you took it out of context and did exactly what he's saying you shouldn't do. That's kind of crazy. It's mental. It is mental. It's absolutely, but they feel like they can get away with it because they're in the hallowed halls of actual media and they're putting this stuff out there. Jvc, do you define it? See what, see what you can be the terms of the financial jokes that pooty pie said there were supposedly the, the funny thing though is that if you look at their numbers, they look like that. The Wall Street Journal. If you look at his numbers, they look like that. And what's so strange, he's making hand gestures down for the Wall Street Journal up for Pooty Pie. And what, what's so strange about it though is that Peter Pie isn't that competition, you know? All right, here we go. Here we go. Let's let some of them. Great. Let's see what we got here. My name is Pia. Whoa. Okay. So Dan, 27 year old

Speaker 1:          01:16:28       playing video games on Youtube. Typical nuts.

Speaker 4:          01:16:33       Okay. 53 million subscriber. You still 55 now Jesus. The biggest star in the site by far. If you go inside the stories,

Speaker 2:          01:16:45       scoop is better.

Speaker 1:          01:16:47       Let's get into the latest scoops. So it's him. This is the, I think this is the one recently. Some of his videos are brief, including Nazi messages, images of Edof Hitler, and explicit antisemitic commentary.

Speaker 4:          01:17:03       So this is the Washington Post's version. It will follow the Wall Street turned, or rather sorry, following a request for from the Wall Street Journal. Disney said the videos are inappropriate and cut ties to Pewdiepie who ran his business cost of millions of dollars of Disney subsidiary maker studios cost pooty pie, millions in a January 11th video, Mr Blah Blah Blah, feature two men holding, assigned reading death to all Jews after hiring them from a freelance

Speaker 5:          01:17:28       website. I liked the editing.

Speaker 2:          01:17:33       So the joke is his reaction to it and the fact that you could subscribe to Kim Star who's like another big youtube, but he was mocking it.

Speaker 5:          01:17:41       I don't think they would actually do it. I feel partially responsible, but I didn't think they would. It might just be my sense of crude, sense of humor, but I think there's something funny about that and I don't fire back in the media for miss characterizing him about it. Again, I think there's a difference between a joke and actual like fucking death to all Jews. If I made a video saying, hey guys, uh, Peter Piot here, death to all Jews, I want you to say after me, death to all Jews. And uh, you know, Hitler was right. I really opened my eyes to why power. And I think it's time that we did something about it. That's essentially how they're reporting this as if that's what I was saying or some shit like that.

Speaker 4:          01:18:29       It's amazing how popular it is with such a shitty grasp of English. He's Swedish apologists can camouflage messages that may still be received and celebrated by hate groups. The southern poverty law center says,

Speaker 2:          01:18:40       yeah, so if, if the southern poverty law center condemns you, it's becoming a bit of a badge of honor these days. In the video since removed, he posted a video of a man dressed as Jesus Christ. I love how they have like since removed is bold and then Jesus Christ is both really nice guys. The Jesus guy. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:18:56       What the F I want it to act upon. God's will. Don't worry though. He stands beside God now he isn't. That's all folks Jesus out.

Speaker 5:          01:19:09       And I wasn't the one who made him say it or was it? No, it wasn't. I don't think so. He set up a go fund me page and his own website so you can take orders from Jesus himself. And also can I just point out

Speaker 2:          01:19:24       this is not what I'm looking for. Where, where are the actual videos of him doing the the Nazi shit? That was it. That's 100% it. That's it. Is there an article that led to all of this? Right, but what we're looking at here, this is the Wall Street Journal's version of it. Yeah. Yeah. So this is, these are the clips and they said this is the actual clips that they're saying are the thing that shows him to be antisemitic. Holy Shit. The W I thought it was way better than, I thought it was just a little theo. He got made off fiverr. Yeah. It's just him prancing around on the Internet. It's just, it's just silly childish jokes and it's all who see? I mean how many Nazis do you think this made? Three. Really? That's how I got, I think three is too high. Just stupid. It's like you don't, it doesn't take a lot to like turn them.

Speaker 2:          01:20:12       There was the really bad thing about this though is the fact that they didn't put this article out until they had like taken these clips and dobbed him in to Disney and Disney. Disney obviously new shit. There's going to be a shit storm about this. So they tried to do this political attack, but why? What is it making money? Losing money is politics or not that politics as well. Yeah. He mocks like, you know, he mocks feminism, you know smocks social justice. He's not, he's not, he's a liberal. He's not a progressive. That's the difference. Why would they think that they could just do that though? Because they've got the power to do that. No one can stop it and you couldn't see that. They did. They cost him millions of dollars. I'm sure they did, but it's now costing them their reputation. I'm [inaudible]. Yeah, I mean you can't just do that.

Speaker 2:          01:20:54       Like Eric Street journals. They, they took a big hit from this. I'm sure that unbelievably arrogant. Well actually do you know it was really interesting, right? There was a off after all of this shit, so blue over there was a bunch of polls done of like 13 to 18 year olds and it was really fascinating how you had like favorability and what, how well known things where and like youtube was really well known, really favorable with kids, you know and then you had the Wall Street Journal which was really well known but really unfavorable with kids. How do the, how the kids know what the Wall Street journalist because of Cutie Pie. So now their strings with the Wall Street Journal in this way, the millions of people that are his fans. Exactly. Well that's a big mistake to a guy with a platform like that. It's of this time when their voters and their, their reading you consuming news, the Wall Street Journal will continue to be there.

Speaker 2:          01:21:40       They'll continue to go down. Beauty pounds still be doing well. But what's the, what's crazy is I never thought of the Wall Street Journal is that what I thought of the Wall Street Journal as being like informative, objective information about my business. When if you asked me like what is the Wall Street Journal? That's how I've always thought of them. So to see the, see this video pretty shocking, isn't it? Well it is disturbing because there's nothing there. No. They make the death to all Jews thing. The fact that city did he pay those guys to hold up that sign I $5 to write on the side so he could go, oh cause you know it kisses taboo. Right? He's just breaking it to be. Exactly, exactly. If nobody had said anything, nothing would come. It's in poor taste and if you're representing Disney, you can't fuck with that stuff. That's all that is.

Speaker 2:          01:22:23       That he's like, he's been, I understand, but it's not, my point is I'm defending I'm, it's not evidence of antisemitism. No. Yeah, no, he's just saying something fucked up because that's, he's trying to be shocking. Yeah. He's just think that Hitler stuff like Holy Shit, there was nothing there and that's so stupid. It's just the stupidest thing in the world. And it's, I mean this is the thing where I look at the Keck stony flag. What I love about this is it's a parody of the Nazi flag, right. Of a swastika. What is it in there? It's in there. It's silly internet stuff. But is it a k in there? Yeah. Yeah, but it's, it's, yeah, it's okay. I can't say when you, when you have to explain any of this to someone. It sounds like a stupid thing in works is Internet humor. I love planting that you would dream fly.

Speaker 2:          01:23:02       I know. Isn't that great? Isn't that great? I'm, but that's what it's supposed to be exact. Right, exactly. Cause that's how they come across to everyone else. It's like guys, you, this is how stupid you look to us. Yeah. To the North End. And then we'll just see that thing that somebody put up about, uh, it's a you and, um, Milo and a bunch of other people and you've got a red pill and it says, get in the car. Normies we're going to save civilization. Someone's gotta do it like Watts. First of all, who the fuck thinks that? That's really, if anyone takes that seriously, they're a fucking idiot. Yeah. That's basic. But that's the, that's the point, isn't it? It's about people who can't laugh at themselves. If you can't laugh at yourself, then we must appointment. But there's also so many layers to this thing.

Speaker 2:          01:23:46       You have to be paying attention to it all the time. Like you to be able to keep up. Like even I have to ask you questions like, wait, what's that? What's going on here? Cause I'm not paying attention. It's a, it's a complex subject. But I think the idea of this, the thing like the southern poverty law center of course came out and condemned Keck, Stan, uh, because they're fucking idea. But it's not real. I exactly, I just check a stance supposed to. Is that, is that supposed to be all right though, is no, no, no, of course it's not. It's actually, it's an identity for people who don't want an identity because I'm not an identitarian. I didn't say it's very non binary. Sounds like Latinex kind of. Yeah. Well, that's none of, that's, that's, that's exactly what it's supposed to sound like when they say I'm a Latin X, I'm, I'm, let me talk to you about my work, blackness and stuff like that.

Speaker 2:          01:24:28       A while to be a woke black person. Well you can be a is donny was, that's why this, let me tell you about my work. Blackness is one of the coolest things you could ever say, but that's the, that's what it is though. Cause when someone comes to you about their identity, is that okay? But this isn't a conversation I want to have with you. It's not politics as usual and it's like, well I don't have an ethnicity or like a, like a, uh, an identity, you know, I don't play identity politics. They played entity politics. Keka Stan is a parody of identity politics and every identity politician hates it. Everyone who, everyone who gets into bed with identity politics. Yeah. One of my blackness or Latina or white whiteness or my Jewishness, whatever it is. Okay, what am I Keka stylishness you know, and they're just like, well, shut up.

Speaker 2:          01:25:05       That's not real well done. You finally got it right. I don't give a shit about your fucking identity. You don't give a shit about mine. So let's talk about the issues, the issues. Dot, dot, dot. So, um, where is it? How does he stand now? Like, so he lost this Disney deal. Oh yeah. The Wall Street Journal or the finalists. But how many people were actually aware of the real content? Like what are you actually did, but I'm, what I'm saying is how many people are aware of versus the magazine Article? Oh, it's a, it's about the type of people who are aware. Because I wasn't aware, of course I knew who he was. I'd heard his name. And when I heard the story, I had heard a bunch of different accounts. I tried to sift between the two and the middle seem to be that he was doing like typical internet stuff being silly, but none of it was really antisemitic close.

Speaker 2:          01:25:55       But that's even milder than what I thought it was. These that's insanely milder, especially when you're using the clips of him saying if I was taken out of context. Yeah, it's, it's, it's absolutely pathetic. Um, but it's obviously the, the audience of the Wall Street Journal is a, the elites, the intelligentsia smarts, rich people, people that don't have a good Internet connection. Yeah, exactly. Well now that we've got the best internet connections, but they're not going to live very long because they're old PD pause audience is coming up. They're going to be the ones who were essentially taking over the world. And pewdie pie is the one who's showing them that look at the things these people are saying they're bad. And you know, because they're attacking me and you know me, I'm not doing anything wrong. So you know, you can't trust these people. They are going to come after you.

Speaker 2:          01:26:41       If, if they can go off to Pewdie Pie, the biggest youtuber in the world, then they can go off to anyone. But it's really dangerous to frame things that way because it's dishonest. And as soon as you do something like that and you make a dishonest representation of this guy of pooty pie, immediately every other thing that you print, I'm going to go, well suspect guys already made that thing about Pootie by and that was bullshit. Like do you add it to a lot of work to make that like to to cherry pick that that hard. Oh they went through six months of video and got like two minutes of footage and it's hilarious. And he does a video everyday. So it's just like, cause I mean you saw the quality of the visual craft, it's just, yeah. Was funded that the Wall Street Journal funded that like that had to cost a lot of money.

Speaker 2:          01:27:24       Right. Well similar, you're paying these guys by the hour, they're working on that to what, what's your bunch of youtube videos maybe millions of people have already watched and then go, we look at the scope we've got and try to find one or two Jewish jokes. She, if he was Jewish, he could a mel brooks is way right to that motherfucker and been fine. But, uh, unfortunately for pd pie he's got white male privilege so you can't do the thing. Ah, well you have to recognize your privilege. Suture important. Check your privilege at the door. It's a, it's a wonderful way for people to control your original sin to tell you yes it is a restaurant. It really is. These people are creating a new priesthood that if you look at the diversity officers, I mean like in Britain and the BBC is the prime example they've started, I mean they actually have job positions where they hire on the basis of race and against people on the basis of race for example.

Speaker 2:          01:28:13       Not even for like if it was like in front of the camera, I can understand, you know, I mean like, I mean I don't like the, we need more black people. We need more brown people, whatever. But I mean I could at least go, well I mean like you were saying that it's good to have examples. I, I can, I can accept that I don't like it, but not the, not because I don't want see Brown people because it's discriminatory on the basis of race. But I can at least accept it for a good conclusion. But for this, it's just a research position behind the scenes. 18 grand a year, you know, making nothing, but all you're doing is typing into google and finding things and they're like, white people can't apply. And I have to fund that with my TV license. It's crazy that white people can apply. I know. No whites allowed so racist and they're wondering why the outrights are doing so well. Why, why so many people just like, you know, get fucked. But the idea that you could say that like your melon content is

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       going to prohibit you from getting this job. Did you, I'm sure you paid attention to the evergreen state college fiasco, Bret Weinstein. Did you listen to Brett when he was on this podcast? From that time I've been busy. He analysts, he's a very shockingly progressive map is, and he's, he's a super liberal and essentially really Nepalese can all you man, he's a really nice guy and yeah, he seemed to, he seemed to and the poor guys in hiding now. Yeah, he's in hiding. He is, he like literally he had to remove his family from, from there and kind of put them in hiding. He um, does the schools essentially almost shut down? Yeah, they took over. I mean the thing is chaos and now they're voting to remove funding and turn into a private school because they're like, you guys are out of your mind. You can't, we can't, that's type of tax dollars.

Speaker 1:          01:29:50       But they told him that he should stay home because they wanted a day of absence where white people were not allowed to go to work. And he was like, what the fuck are you doing? I'm Jewish. That not only that, it's like that's racist. And they're like, no, your race without the woman at one of the women who was responsible for it called his wife are racist. And without saying that white, what he called, she called for it on a facebook post. She called for white women to take this racist white, take her rice, wait, racist white ass out or something like that. Then think about this old hall or out, maybe calling out. The thing about all of this really dangerous because at some point white people go, yeah, okay, but she's calling her white. She's calling her a racist white. Damn. It just because someone doesn't agree with you on something that's really racist doesn't mean they're racist.

Speaker 1:          01:30:37       Of course not. But it's dangerous to do this because I mean, if you're going to use this as a weapon against the [inaudible], this is, this is an attack. Yeah. He's refusing to cooperate. So they're attacking him. Well, it's a control. It's without a doubt. It's about control because this is 100% about people trying to control other people's political, political, and this is a political attack and if you're going right, you don't want to be a racist d at some point the white people just going to go, I guess I'm racist. Did you see where they had the president and they were talking to him and the president was addressing these students. They were being fucking completely ridiculous. And they told him to put his hands down because his hands were a microaggression. And then a kid stood up next to him in like a threatening manner and told him to put his hands down and he put his hands down.

Speaker 1:          01:31:18       They started laughing, they started laughing. It's clearly game. They're playing ping pong. They're playing checkers and just bullied him knowing him. But this, it's not just that, it's not just bullying, it's like them grouping up. It's theresa toward each other and how he feels or he was saying that he believes it's like a mass psychosis that literally, it's like a mass hysteria. It's like people losing their minds in this large, losing the, amongst all that being given undue power that they don't deserve. They have an end all of this pile, but they're doing something with that power. If they gave you that power, you wouldn't. So it is some sort of a psychosis. Absolutely. These people, uh, that they've never been, they're not being held to an account. Right then I'll be told, look, when you, when you earn power,

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       you Germany happiness a karate kid, isn't it? You, you home power. You have to be responsible with that power. And that's what a good leader is. These people are just being given power. They haven't earned it. They've been given it and they are being told they can't do anything wrong. And so they think, well fuck, I'll do whatever the fuck I like them. They're also told that like you can always step up and talk about your blackness or whatever and everyone has to kind of shut the fuck up. Like you, you have like there's these carp launch. Yes. There's these subjects that you can sort of do like intersect or, or um, uh, inject your, your race into or your gender or the fact that you're trans or the fact that your allies and marginalized in any way Latino and you can kind of shut down discussion.

Speaker 2:          01:32:43       And it's one of the things that you see when this president is addressing the students and the students step up and they're asking, there's this long, it looks like a hostage negotiator. That's what's fair. They get up and they start talking about their own individual identity and he told you about the color of my skin. That's not my business, but whatever it is, the my, the fact that I have a vagina and the fact that I would like to hear about my exams and it's that my wife's going to complain to be honest. It becomes the thing, you know, it becomes the thing that you're discussing rather than whatever the actual thing you're discussing is. That's the problem of identity politics. It's not a form of politics. It doesn't go anywhere. It's designed to grind to the dialog, to a halt and to give the person making the argument control of everyone else around them.

Speaker 2:          01:33:25       That's where it unjustly, this person hasn't earned this. Yeah. That's where it is, right? It's like you have a total control of the conversation now and you have set like these very clear parameters and there's a lot of that man. There's a lot of that sensor. It is not, it's not healthy. It's just bizarre that that would fly in a university setting and have his lattus or agrees with it. Yeah, the Dean, some of them, but also they don't want to lose their jobs and students coming in, you know they're going to change the world or they'll click a mob that look an enemy faction, an Ami within these things. And this, this, this is the reason that I'm so good at identifying this cause unwell. Really well read in like power politics. I mean if you want to read, if you don't know what's going on, we need to do is read the prints, read Lindt scan, read Robert Greene, that'll teach you how to understand these people and these people are the, I mean everything they're doing is about power and control.

Speaker 2:          01:34:15       It's about, it's about influence over what's going on. And at any point you can break this influenced by just simply understanding how the gaining it. I think Jordan Peterson has got some pretty unique insight into it because he's been dealing with it for several years and in a very high profile way. But one of the things that he said that he believes it's about revenge, he says he thinks that a lot of these people that are so active on campus and they're, they're in this fever pitch, he goes, a lot of them were bullied and pushed around when they were younger and they were socially awkward and not in the good, cool groups and now they want revenge and this is why they want to label everyone who plays sports as being some sort of a massage, Enos woman raper you know, I mean that's really what it is.

Speaker 2:          01:34:59       Like everyone who's in a frat house is a, as a massage, Dennis homophobic rapists like is no way around it. You're in a frat. It's like the full, yeah. I like that woman who thought it was okay to say that that guy who got killed like that, they would do coke and rape girls in a frat party. Like what? Okay. This is a caricature. This, I mean, getting, imagine if someone did a, an equal caricature about a black man. It's so racist counts. Unbelievably racist. It is racist, but it's just, it's also redefined racism and what this will mean. These guy's dead fucking got beaten to death taking a poster. It's all he did. But you're, you're putting all these straw man definitions on this guy, but all this guy did is andy young guys, dumb thing. I'm going to steal this poster. He, and he's dead now.

Speaker 2:          01:35:45       Like that's it. It took the, the fact that the regime, you got no sympathy for him whatsoever. What the Fuck's wrong with you? Be Cool. If he was Columbian, if he was a Colombian American, they beat him to death like that. Would that be okay? How would you feel then? Would you, would you come up with some sort of a Colombian, uh, influenced that he's got that you don't have, and so he's got some sort of a Colombian privilege, but I mean, how, how is this not going, not being hideously oppressed anyway, he's been captured, you know, they'll take them by the North Koreans had been beaten to death. Yeah. Then they will literally, I'll proof that your white male privilege isn't universal. It's like, oh, you know, if you're going to say that, I mean, you'd have to be a fucking moron. Say that. Because everything about the ideology itself is contextual.

Speaker 2:          01:36:21       It's power plus privilege. They're full. It must have a context. There must be more white people around for it to work. And therefore, if we go to Zimbabwe, white people are hideously oppressed by that definition in Zimbabwe when the white foam is getting the funds appropriated by black African Pan monks, it's sort, they are. Then of course, they're being oppressed. Of course. It's not universal. Of course, it's contextual. It's the most asinine thing to say, oh, it's not universal. Fucking de [inaudible] also universal what you were talking about. I'm drinking up cause I'm really dehydrated and don't worry about it. I'll have to hydrate myself. Apologize for drinking water. I don't know why. I mean I know I'm consistently doing it and it's like don't worry about it man. Yeah. Um, but I think it's also what you were talking about where they want to make it all about them.

Speaker 2:          01:37:04       Like here this woman has taken this situation which is horribly tragic and now she's talking about students that she has to deal with that are white men that are doing coke and raping girls at Frat parties and just like this guy. What is this a horrible generalization. They can, they keep making it the stories as well, but she's making about her and her classes and the guys that she had, the clueless guy's that she has to deal with in her classes and she's just deciding that this guy is that without any personal knowledge of him at all. But she's a future. We've gone and she's turning it on herself and she's a victim because she has to deal with these students and these clueless white, rich male students. Fuck man. I'm just saying. His note twats out there. They're a bunch of dudes who are shitheads and for sure there are just like there's women that suck to humans that suck.

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       It has nothing to do with gender or race or that's racist to categorize them in that particular, there's plenty of humans that are, that happened to be white males that are great, that happened to be black women that are great, that Ha. There's plenty of people that are cool across the board in every single gender race of course. How you treat people as equals and shunts of the character. I'm okay, we send mean that's the right way to do things. That's the most disturbing thing about this. Is it a fucking professor who's teaching young people is generalizing this horrendous way and she thinks it's okay because this kid stole a poster and what did he think was going to happen? What did he think was going to happen? Jesus Christ. When you're 20 years old, you're not thinking, how the fuck does this dummy not know that?

Speaker 2:          01:38:41       How does she not understand? Just just the science of the development of the human brain, which has been clearly established over the past 2030 years. 20 when it finally, step five is the frontal cortex this and it's not even develops. Kids do stupid things of course, course unbelievably stupid. And I have it. I'm sure you have to, especially if you have a deck. There's something about being a dude that makes it dumber. My mom's like, do dumb shit. My missus light look, you know, I don't, I don't wanna sound like a big, but it's always men. It's always men, but I just want to impress women or something like that. It's, well, but let me, let me educate you on something. Please do at at, and I'll put the wood. We'll put the letters tw before it Twat. Yes. That's how you say it. Yes.

Speaker 2:          01:39:20       If you're going to appropriate a language American now. That's why we spelled tires and tire. It's Twat. Nice twins. No, it didn't say any way you want dude. But I'm saying twice. If I say it's flat and there's more of US 12 zero view. We stole your language. It, man, it's ours now. It's American. Right. Okay. So in, in the future, you know, it won't be English anymore, but like Latin became Spanish. So I've got like another 10 minutes or anything else you want to talk about anything man? What do you want to talk about besides our need? Our sarkeys yeah. Jesus Christ, Bro. She's going to be victimized by this pause. Oh, she's, she's already pissed. But yeah. Anyway, by the way, I need a, I got no hate for Ya. All right, so I'm not, I'm not this too. I haven't gone, I talked to you just about that.

Speaker 2:          01:40:08       Macintosh should come on. You should come on. Um, Jonathan McIntosh. Yeah, grow up. There's a lot of those guys. A lot of those vampire familiars. You ever see the movie blade member, the vampire familiar and hangs around with the vampires and thinks he's going to get in and they eventually kill him? Yeah. Same thing with the 30 days of night, except the, the vampire familiars don't usually sexually assault the vampires. They rare those male feminist guys, they really get that off. I love the panels. Will tweet. Didn't, he was like, you know the, the male feminists, sexist, sexual Predator is the sort of, you know, a Catholic priest must in children of our generation. It's so true. It is fucking true and a lot of ways I love male feminists. That's just like the creepiest looking mother fuckers and then it tends either way if you're not that way

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       and you identify yourself as a feminist. No, I'm not talking about you. I know what you're saying. There's a lot of people out there that really wants to, they get locked into it because it sounds, it sounds right. You know, like, oh are you free equal rights through him and yeah. Then you're a feminist. Okay. Then my feminist and you say it and then people treat you differently because you say, because of they said, well you've done a good job, billy. I'm going to pat you on the head. You called yourself a feminist. Yeah. Why'd you define yourself, man? Are you a human like every good human wants equality. I'll ring good yo like many labels as well. You know why you're denying sexism. Like, you know, like you don't have to be a pro black ally deny, uh, or to, to rather, uh, deny accepting any form of racism or not. That's a bad way. Describe

Speaker 3:          01:41:39       it. It's how they define these things. If, if the, if they have a different definition, if they say where it's structural, it's a, you know, like, um, institution, we'll talk about racism. It's an easier way of framing it and you say, well, you know, I think a racism, I don't think the structures are actually racist. I think that the individuals, certain individuals within the structures are racist. Then what you're doing is undermining their entire philosophy. And if you're undermining their entire philosophy by effectively individualizing it, robin collectivizing it, then they have to consider you an enemy because what you'll, if everyone, if you go, yeah, and then someone else goes, you know, that's a good way of looking at, I don't look at that too. And then a lot of people got, you know, that's a great point. Then suddenly their philosophy is just going to collapse.

Speaker 3:          01:42:19       No one's going to believe what they're saying and they can be like, no, but this is what I'm being horribly oppressed. Never. I was like, well, not really. There are some racist, but we deal with them. We've got the balls, you know, we've got laws against racism, we've got laws, the affirmative action laws to bring black people and you know, I don't think the system is actually as racist as you're saying. I think that maybe there were a few bad actors and when we see when we can spot them and get them, get them out, you know, then what, how these people going to play the victim when they get to play the victim. There's real racism and there's also real people playing the victim and there's bolt, of course there's real racism, but we're vigilant. Flat. Where are racist? Just tolerated well. Oh the president now.

Speaker 3:          01:42:53       Exactly that. The president, that company's racist. Yeah. Well we're just going to leave him because you know, he's just like, you know, he sees all right. You still didn't get jump and of course he's not there. He's going to be out of the door for sure. They frame Pewdie Pie as being someone who may have been spreading antisemitism, which he always got some like millions of followers though. Well they did like two, 3 million, but they constantly were millions of dollars. But I think ultimately it'll probably balances itself out. It's already gone in his favor. Everyone fuck themselves. Yeah. But that's only because there was a credible alternative media. I mean like pd Pie. Uh, there's, there's me and another youtube, nickel, crowns and TV. Both made videos about what's his name was talking so fast. You want to add overall? No, it's just, there's so much I need to tell you.

Speaker 3:          01:43:31       Oh, I'm probably not going to be here again and there's a lot you need to know, man. You coming back. I'd love to know what I've had it been most sleep as well. I don't do anything. But anyway, a youtube called crowds and t crowds and t, he's a German guy, uh, Kraut and t o t like the, cause he's half English, half German. Oh, I get it. Um, and, uh, he did a video about this as well. I did a video about this and p Dubai did a video using the information as the systems we've compiled to be like, to do his own video and used us as sources. St Let the smoke got this information and he'd swing out. And I was like, Holy Shit, that's really nice of him. But it's really interesting how we helped him fight back because he's not, he's a comedian, you know, he doesn't do all this professionally.

Speaker 3:          01:44:12       He doesn't know what to look for, you know, new one. Why would he, you know, would, you wouldn't expend too, but luckily this was a house speciality. We've been going, it's the media since day one because we know there are a bunch of liars. We know they are. Some of them are right. There's gotta be not all of them. There's got to be good journalists. That's no excuse. So you now have a platform where the Wall Street Journal, if you want to maintain your reputation, you don't publish shit like that. Unaccepted. What is their response that then Kevin don't address it. That's why. Should, that seems so crazy. That's it. They can't, they should address that. Absolutely. The ship. I mean there's no sue them and now I don't think he sued them. Why? I don't know. I don't think he wants the trouble. If he sued the monk back in, I believe, dude, you think you would win?

Speaker 3:          01:44:55       Oh God. Can't see how he could lose, you know, what can you prove they cost you money easily? Yeah. Is this actual antisemitism? Obviously not. Yeah. Did they take you out of context? Clearly and in fact, what are the jokes was that they would take him out of context? How could he lose this? Yeah. Well some it is possible. What he should do is find out how much the Wall Street Journal cost to buy and then crowdfunded and I donate to that. I spread it around. Yeah. What was the, there was a lawsuit, recent lawsuit that I couldn't believe was thrown out. God Damn it. And I can't remember it now, Eh. And I remember laying a few hundred million dollars, but like, I mean he's got 55 million subscribers and he's a very influential man. Then there are a lot of people who like him who would love to support. Maybe it's possible.

Speaker 3:          01:45:44       Maybe he could, maybe he could speak to, I know some nice wealthy benefactors who are like, you know what? I hate these people. Like Peter Teal Guy, what he did with Hulk Hogan versus, exactly. Yeah. Why not? Wouldn't it just be the funniest thing in the world? CPD pies, the owner of the Wall Street Journal. Just be hilarious. Perfect. You know, and it wouldn't be the wealthy billionaires who happened to be obviously wealthy having to be watching this and you know what? We could get one over on these bitches and that we don't have to just let them win. We don't have to just let them when we could. We might feel like the New York Times feels incredibly challenged right now. Jenna, we were talking about, I know the New York Times, just making sure I was going to say with you, just, you're just so ready to go. I am just so much words, unfortunately.

Speaker 3:          01:46:28       I know you don't have much time, but about us. Donald Trump was going to say. Yeah, I wish I had. I wish I had. Was there any way you could reschedule or schedule your flight? Do you need, I could just, I mean, if you want to carry on, I could just cancel 10 if you, I just want to make sure you don't get stuck here. Well, I can just buy another ticket tomorrow. Are you sure it will cost me a fortune, but it's fine. Well, a fortune for an hour of podcasting seems one over it. You've only got an hour.

Speaker 2:          01:46:50       I've got another hour and Japan probably more. It's probably a thousand pounds. I probably shouldn't. What's a thousand pounds? $1,200 will take care of it. Really? Yeah. We'll put it on the budget. What the fuck am I gonna do for the rest of the day? We're going to hang out, man. You're going to go to the movies? Yes, there have an ice cream. Well, I'm going to get a decision. I don't know what you're going to do, dude. If you want to do another hour of podcasting, we can. We should just say we were supposed to start at nine. We're a little late because of traffic here is insane. My wife's gonna kill me. You was going to kill if you don't come home think, oh man. She'll understand that. You sure? Yeah. Mixed messages. She understand she's going to kill you. This Sheila. All right, so we keep going. So where were we?

Speaker 2:          01:47:29       We were wasting money by buying the wallstreet journal with Keith teals. Money. Yeah. Well, what I was saying is that the New York Times feels very challenged by donald trump's dismissal of them is fake news and all these different attacks. And because of that they sort of doubled down on the ethics of journalism. They tried really hard to be better at what they do. Yeah, yeah. I saw, yeah, they actually, but that's a real indictment of the state of journalism, isn't it? When they have to do is a little bit, we're going to recommit ourselves to actually being journalists. Good thinking. We'll stay in Houston, New York Times called out in a way that they've never been called out before. Of course they did lose. Yeah. I mean, he's the president. They became political activists. They weren't generalists. They rise and they were on the losing side, get ranked, you know, of course you've got to suddenly go, well, okay, hold on, hands up.

Speaker 2:          01:48:14       I can't, let's, let's try not being a lie as anymore. What does that trickle down from? Is it from the editors who lost sight? Is it the writers themselves that they hire? Is it the ethics behind the business of the magazine or the of the newspaper? Unfortunate. I don't know the ins and outs of the, I mean if he had a Spec, I don't know. If I had to speculate, I'd probably say it's coming from the top and they're just like, what the fuck is happening? Right. Like we're seeing with these tech companies, like we're seeing with these people that are like uber progressive in Google or wherever the fuck they are. Yup. Yeah. It's a weird thing, man. We're, we're dealing with a real, I mean, I hate to use the word, but it's the real word. Cultural War. Yeah, it is. I mean that's the term.

Speaker 2:          01:48:52       It's the correct term. Block culture warriors. And this is why this is when I turn this in, like power politics because they all are attacking people that you mean like attacking pd pie that costing them money. I mean they didn't even publish their article. The Wall Street Journal didn't even publish the rascal before they had gone to Disney and got them to pull them money from him. Wow. Brought it to Disney. How? See how just because they heard that he was getting this big fat deal from Disney and they were like, fuck this guy is cause pd pie doesn't play ball with them. Does he say ball and how so? He's not a progressive but oh he's a liberal. He doesn't sit there going, oh well you know feminism's good idea guys. And he's not, he's red pilling the the new generation about feminism. He makes anti-feminism fuzzy videos every now and again.

Speaker 2:          01:49:36       And they're actually quite funny. You'd people should check him out. He's just bragging on this cause it's stupid shit. You know, it's the sort of stupid shit like we've been talking about and rightly so. This is bollocks and it's good that he's telling kids, look, this is crap t just treat people well. You know, like just treat people as an individual. Ma Ma say madame, of course it is crap, but I don't even think it's being sort of like it's eroding the same way male feminism is eroding. That term is a very derogatory term. We call someone a male feminist. Most people just go, Ugh, if you call someone a social justice warrior, I mean that is a term now that term is not something that someone carries. There was a while where people were like, I read quotes like, yeah, we are warriors. Like what?

Speaker 2:          01:50:17       Yeah, like I mean the beginning, they were like embracing it. Yeah. I mean it's not a an sjw on the Joe Rogan podcast, don't you let the number one podcast in the world. It's probably up there. Yeah. It's not an sjw sign. Hey telling me, listen, let me tell you. Let me tell you how to check your privilege show. No, I haven't had one of those on. I would be, I would be fascinated. You should get one on just to pick the brain. No worries. Studio is, and you have to talk to them for an hour. Yeah. But I mean, I can tell you what they think. So I've spoken to him. I mean, so pete, that's a cop out because the people who have looked, you're your bird show bolts was your boss was like, no, actually I shouldn't. I should just talk. I'm just not interested in you.

Speaker 2:          01:50:51       Yeah. Well you're creepy and weird and you've probably harass someone. So there's some, there's some merit to having these volatile discussions with people that you disagree with. Oh yeah. I like it. It's also people keep asking me to Richard Spencer, so, yeah. But I've told her stay wes already. I know what the identitarian is thinking. I mean, whenever every time, like someone that camp black is that they're going, oh, let me tell you about my blackness. It's, he's a youtuber called cab black. Oh, you're deep in the youtube world. Oh yeah, of course I am. If you refer to him like we all know who you're talking about. Yeah. Sorry. But she, she's actually really good talking about call row. Yeah. She's like, she's black transits you, but she's actually great and people are going to be surprised to hear me say that, but I've never done a video, a bouncer because she's not full of Shit.

Speaker 2:          01:51:30       She's just an identity. Tarian but that doesn't mean that she's bad or anything like this. That just means she talks about herself a lot. Um, but she's actually got this really great streak in her that's really fair. And so when the, I mean, these people run like lemmings off cliff when they get an idea in their head that, oh my God, yes, we should all, you know, jump on. Yeah. You know, like Lacy Green, when she abandons their community or something, you know, there was a lacy green, she's another youtube on, so she is Christ church, right? You're in youtube. You should allegedly, um, who is a lacy green, what does she's, she's a feminist who realized how toxic the community that she was part of millions of subscribers. Oh, wait a minute. Is she the girl that was it turned out was dating some sort of Reagan, some guy. Who is he Indian? Rj? No.

Speaker 2:          01:52:20       Are you joking around? But he, yeah, he's probably, well, okay, well I don't give a fuck if he's watching it, but try to follow this up. I'm going to talk to him later. Yeah. No, he's not in the end Nazi on pc. Jesus Christ. What was his deal though? They start dating like a, he's just an anti, he's NCSD WWII cheap. Let me, Oh, he's, he's pretty liberal. Yeah. That's what it is. Okay. So he's an anti s j w person. That's what he is. Yeah. So what basically disaffected liberals mostly. And so anti identity people got mad at her because she was dating this guy who they don't agree with. Yeah. Because he's against feminism and black lives matter. Why does it, why do people give a fuck who people date? Why is that a pause then? Controlling psycho cultists. Mm. And they dragged her all across social media.

Speaker 2:          01:53:01       I mean, some of the worst things I've, I've seen. Really? Oh yeah, yeah, absolutely. And what did they talk about? Oh, like, just so you know, I mean like one thing that annoys me is that like, you know, six months ago everyone was like, yeah, we love Lisa Green, she's great, she's a feminist, she's a sex Ed, stuff's brilliant, blah, blah, blah. And then as soon as she's like, you know, I kind of, I met this guy, I like this guy and he's actually making some really good points that like your sex ed stuff sucked. You suck everything you've ever done, suck. Get out of [inaudible]. And then, I mean she gets death threats and things like that and she used to get them from like, I guess like I'll write a types who were in the basements or something who hate, but now again, she gets it from stw Thomas.

Speaker 2:          01:53:38       I with people would just not send threats and shit. It doesn't do anything. It just makes, it's just nasty for people. Well definitely is that, but it's just, it's so sad that someone can't just date someone that they don't agree with. Yes. Fuck me. Like she obviously likes the guy of course is you can't change your opinion either. You're cleaning can't evolve. It can't be a flip flopper yeah. In like can you even control what you believe? I believe that you could, but then and what did I just say? Believe that I believe that I could control what I believe. Yeah, exactly. So now you don't believe it, right? Cause you've just decided, I don't believe that. Now I'm going to believe I can change now. Well I believe that people do change for sure, but none of their ideas is all like a, it's not like a conscious choice to say, you know what, one day, I mean I'm an atheist so one day I'm going to be like, actually yeah, I'm going to choose to believe in God.

Speaker 2:          01:54:28       Do you either believe or you don't believe in? I don't think it's a choice. Well I could see what you're saying, but I think that when you're, when you're going over the possibilities of any subject in your mind you are, you're influenced by a host of factors as well. How you physically feel, where you are in your life, what, what kind of relationship you have with your family, like where your job is right now. Like where are you? I know a lot of people that hit the fucking bottom and then all of a sudden they became religious. Do you think that that's a, it's not a coincidence. No. It's like at that stage in your life you needed to believe something and that helped you and helped you to believe that thing. And maybe, I mean, how many dudes find Jesus where they're getting their dick sucked and the Jacuzzi.

Speaker 2:          01:55:11       Yeah, exactly. That's probably pretty low. Yeah. Right? Yeah. Yeah. Unless it's like really bad blow job and you just feel sad and you actually could cause terrible at everywhere. Anytime Jesus help me, help me, Jesus. But you know, people find, they find love and happiness in weird places. They find depression weird places. So it's really a lot of like what you believe depends on where you're at in your life. It can very well be influenced where you go one way or the other. And then once someone has an opinion, whether it's God is real, our God is fake, they fucking fight that to the death. Like that is their stance and they can't change it. They can't move it around. And if you do, you're off flip flopper if he didn't resign yourself into it, then you can be reasoned out to it. It's true.

Speaker 2:          01:56:00       Well that term flip flopper so fight, it's so stupid because it's a more chronic political term and really only existed because politicians did not have a forum to defend the evolution of their ideas before. Now they can go online. Bernie Sanders as a fucking podcast, you know, now let's see. Yeah, he does listen to, they can go on youtube or facebook. They don't need to be in some sort of a, um, you know, political forum, some sort of a formal debate. Yeah, they don't, they can just talk about their idea was like, this is what I used to believe and this is why I changed my mind. And they could do that over the course of an hour and a youtube video. And it's clearly as the mind could decipher, state their opinions on things, but because people couldn't in the past, like he used to be tough on crime, now he's a flip flopper yeah, you'll politics, you know, it might not be what happened.

Speaker 2:          01:56:49       He might used to be tough on crime, but then he was given evidence of systematic racism that he realized how corrupt the police department is. And then he realized that they have mandated quotas where they have to arrest a certain amount of people and this is probably the best place to do it because those people don't have the money for legal representation and like, so that's why my opinion evolve. But you couldn't do that in the past. So someone would just call you a flip flopper yeah, the Internet has changed everything and for the better, by a long shot, I mean like we, by the way, this is not discrediting real flip flopping. Right. Obviously if something, if someone, if someone's, you know, it doesn't really hold a position and they're just doing it because it's a popular thing to do. Like Hillary Clinton, for example.

Speaker 2:          01:57:26       Perfect example. Clinton and trump own gay marriage. Yeah. That's the best. Trump has been consistent on that for decades now. Hillary Clinton 2008 was like, well I believe it's men and a woman until 2013 it wasn't until 2013 she finally came clean and when, when? When gay marriage, right. I didn't even know that there's not 2017 I believe that in this video of her from 2013 in fact saying that marriage is between a man and a woman. Of course she would. And then suddenly, oh no, you've got to change the position that, and she's like, yeah, whatever. I didn't give a shit cause I'm Hillary Clinton. I'm here for the money. Yes. You know, I'm here. I'm a careerist. I'm, I'm going to be the first woman president because I have to fuck Bill Clinton. All right. I would love to read what the crazy shit she said to those bankers.

Speaker 2:          01:58:08       And those quarter million dollar speeches. I would love to know the transcripts that she won't release. New wiki leaks is released. The of, I did not know that. Really? You want to do this? She goes, oh dude, she wants some crazy stuff. Like she wants some, this is a hemispheric open borders where like one hemisphere is just, you know, free and open and another one is free and open and t to eventually get like a united globalized world. And you know the Anderson, there's loads of stuff in there that's just, and she's saying how she holds a public. The bankers, she said that in the speech that she holds a public and a private position. Yeah. Okay. I did not know that. They can't, that Bernie Sanders ever discussed that it was pretty since he's, I don't know. He's done. No, don't even a cook. Oh No. He's not considered Bernie Sanders.

Speaker 2:          01:58:55       Seems like a very nice man, but he's a cook. He's a bit of, well, I mean you saw black lives matter take over stage, right? Oh yeah, I did. That was sad. It was fucking sad. Bernie a man. These little bullies have got no right to your platform and they're literally squeezing him. We are being reasonable screaming in his face. I Bernie. Yeah. As soon as some of the minus side, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. That lost me. I didn't approve of I, you know, I was, I was, I was at that point, a supporter of Bernie. I like Bernie. I thought, okay, he's maybe maybe a little further left. I'd be like, I'd have to. Good. He took a chance and having them go up there and then I liked that though. I liked it. He took the chance to let them, todd and I, I don't think they should be able to do it, but I think it does give you a sense of who he is that he's like, all right, tell me what you want.

Speaker 2:          01:59:42       Tell me what you're looking at. Then he's just like standing at the side like, Tony, you're not a leader. Me. Well, if he moves his hands there. Microaggression. Exactly. We've learned that. Not, you know, you should've had your boundaries. I mean, you didn't immediately capitulate, so that was your boundaries. You didn't stick to it. Ah, that's a good point. You should, you should've said, listen, no, I'm going to call security. You're going to be a school to the way maybe we could discuss it in future. If someone comes up to you and stuff screeching your face that they're being reasonable. You draw the line and you stick to it. You do not let that person bully you out of your podium. It's yours, not theirs. They've got no right to it. Tell them to get fucked. He's being investigated now they're going after I heard, but I haven't looked into it.

Speaker 2:          02:00:24       Financial dealings with his wife and him and a small university where, uh, she made some decisions that ultimately didn't pan out financially and it caused the university to go under. Oh Damn. They acquired a bunch of new land and they were going to expand the university and they got a lot of loans and they started construction, all this jazz. And apparently it just wasn't sustainable. And so now, um, I think there's allegations, which of course whenever something fails like that, there's allegations that someone ms handle something. So they've been forced her to this lawyer dump. Um, I do not know it's been the news, you know, I haven't really deeply gone into the story, but the, the, the basics of the story are she worked for this university. She wanted it to expand. They got spend a lot of money expanding. It didn't work out so it doesn't sound on the face of it.

Speaker 2:          02:01:19       And like malfeasance was necessarily involved. The worry is that he used his influence to make some certain things happen. The allowed to take place perhaps while I, that's the allegation I believe. I still think Rome, polk and wind to be honest. He might, he's old. Yeah, he's waiting to open. He's way too old. They're always talking about if you're a politician. So old days because it takes that long for trust. You, it's sad though, isn't there like some guy in his forties he's basically saying the same thing as Bernie Sanders who hasn't liked any stills still gets bonners. We don't trust him. Great. He gives a shit. We fuck. Is this the thing that Bill Clinton, man, it really pissed me off site. I don't think shit people do. It's weird if it's because they can find out about it and they couldn't find out about it before.

Speaker 2:          02:02:04       So you got a guy like jfk was a total pussy hound who people revere is a great, great, yeah, we'll push the hand. Supposedly. Yeah, he was smoking hot fire. Who called? Who knows the thing like why do we care under a question? And that's a problem with him and his wife. You know, that's nothing to do with writing, you know? And it doesn't surprise me. It's all great. Men always get women flinging themselves at them and okay, there are many human, if you've got some really attractive woman flinging herself out, you're going to go and we can just, nothing's going to go wrong. And that'll be great. No one died. No fucking surprise. Right. It's not a judgment on their character either. That's just them being a bit weak in the moment, you know? I know. They know it's wrong. They know they shouldn't have done it.

Speaker 2:          02:02:44       All right, well, the culture is very, very different and the culture of politics was very different back then. People knew about the president's affairs. Like what was that? Uh, who is the president that had polio? Uh, who's the president had polio and other one. You had a wheelchair. What does it, was it Roosevelt? He is he the guy who he's got the little, little round glasses and smile. It was a roosevelt had polio. I'd have to look it up. Um, anyway. Yeah, he was, yeah. Teddy Franklin, Franklin, Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Um, he had polio and um, the press knew it and they hid it from everybody. They just, uh, no one. Yeah, it's weird, isn't it? Yeah. I mean that was the thing with JFK. That was the thing of Lyndon Johnson famously held a press conference while he was taking a shit. He was literally taking a shit with the door open in the stall when he's talking to the press because there was like boundaries, you know, they couldn't say, it's kind of code of honor.

Speaker 2:          02:03:40       Yeah. This guy was taking a horrible student and Shit. No, no, no. Well, I also think that once Watergate broke, once you realize that, hey, it's pretty obvious this president is a fucking liar. And a crook and we need, if we have any responsibility, we need to expose this. Well, once you expose that man, you open up that door. Whoa. People find out the genie's out of the bottle and then they want to know everything you'd want to know. As soon as it becomes permissible, whether they're saying it's up to people, not to camp, it's up to people to understand that look, at the end of the day, you are the person who is making the difference and it's a small difference. But if we all agree that we're all making small difference than when you're working, I'm going to act in a way that I find personally responsible. If we will say, right, well we're going to act in ways that we fund pestering responsible, they'll just end up with the best of worlds without having to change anything, right? Yeah. No heads. Don't you think that today is probably harder than ever the to manage like what you're paying attention to and what you're not? Oh yeah, we'll, we'll, if, yeah. If you're thinking about like fake news and like pots and I mean that, that's a real problem. The social media is like, there've been

Speaker 1:          02:04:38       studies done that showed like, and it's, it's more on the left, but it's also very much on the right, you know, like, you know, they're like 70, 60 or something like that, you know, but it's slightly more on the left where people just essentially, essentially get one political viewpoint. And so that the, the social media is just a stream of content that's all telling you the same thing. What was the story that just came out about a fake news story that costs some company, some untold millions of dollars. Might've been even been, they might've even said be $1 billion in stock. And it just came out today like that sound that, uh, a company was extremely devalued because of a fake news story that is a danger. Yeah. Oh, it's a big danger. Especially if you trade in the stock market and then all of a sudden it causes a cascade of panic and people just start dumping their stock and you're fucked.

Speaker 1:          02:05:27       It's all turns colby face. So, I mean, the idea would be that it would balance out eventually, but if it was a fragile company, who knows what this will damage that could have done to them. Did you find it? It's a really recent news story. It just came out like this, the today or yesterday. It's the flip side of like being able to hold people accountable. You know, it's it. Yeah. You can't hold, the Internet's fantastic in social media is fantastic. Youtube, fantastic. And you can, I mean, I think you could make real arguments that these things are now, but like critical to free speech. I agree. I mean land and there should be like, this should be understood, but on the flip side, someone could say something that's not true. That's free speech. Yeah. Well that's, it's unfortunate, but it's amazing when you really think about it, how rare it is.

Speaker 1:          02:06:10       I mean, even though it's fairly common, you're talking about 7 billion people. Even phony happened once a day. That's still only one thing a day. That's nothing. But I mean it is up to everyone. I mean like the, they'll probably have to educate kids in school. We need, right? When you see something going around the social media, you're going to have to fact check it. I think there's going to be much more sophisticated ways of understanding whether or not someone's being honest. And I think what we're looking at now is just like when people started reading books that were written, they never imagined that someone was going to have a printing press. And when people had a printing press, no one was ever going to imagine that you're going to put that on the Internet. So I think there's probably something around the band right now for us that it's going to radically change the factual interpretation of information.

Speaker 1:          02:06:57       Like you're going to know what's real and what's not. And it's probably going to be something that you're not even going to understand what it's about now. Like that as technology evolves and it's bizarre, an exponential way, they're going to reach some new critical way of distributing information and then things are going to get very strange. Just the way they're strange now where we have this radical new ability to put out content like you do or I do. Yeah. I think in the future there's going to be another change that's just as monumental and justice huge and it's probably going to deal with how we interface with that data. Like some sort of uh, uh, but wearable thing or a mind thing where you can recognize patterns

Speaker 2:          02:07:36       as being true or untrue. Recognize humans is being honest or dishonest. Like you're going to be able to see, you're going to find it, man. You could, we're going to get to, you know what people are really worried about the lack of privacy now I feel like that is just step one, tell this ultimate, very bizarre symbiotic relationship we're going to have with each other and, and technology where we're going to beat inside each other's heads in a very simple way. It comes back. It's kind of what I was saying about racism. Uh, let me the sjws and like the evergreen college students king, Hey, if you do this, you're a racist. I mentioned the SCA. Yeah, I'm a racist. They'll just say it and it can then be like, yeah, but you're a racing them. But yeah, I know what's next. And they'll be like, yeah, but you're supposed to do something because otherwise I'll call you a racist.

Speaker 2:          02:08:20       Yeah, cal just be a racist then it doesn't mean anything anymore. Final racing, all you have to get consent to give that power. And if I don't consent, like you know, if you like what was a key I can wold or whatever. Who would the tentacle porn. He should've just done it. But yeah, fuck you. You probably watched him shit stuff too. But they say, oh my God, he looks at tens, couple and he's like, yeah. And you look at wall, go on, tell me what you'll pull them. Watching habits are gone. And tell me about your puritan puritanical porn watching you just watched two people in missionary for 20 minutes and then that gets you off. Does it shut up? Even if it doesn't get you off and you can watch it, you know, like what if he just like, what the fuck? Like if you looked through my youtube lists or the, you looked at my, uh, history online, you'd be like, is that something you like?

Speaker 2:          02:09:05       No, I was gonna to it. The fuck it, let's see what it was. Yeah. I don't like car accidents, but I watched that motorcycle kicked that car and the car spins out and hits the barrier. Then flips that other car. Yeah, I saw it. Everybody saw it. Does it mean I liked it? No, ain't no, but you know, a lot of it's technical. Yeah. Well there's something about that makes me skeptical. Wow. He should've just done and it is such a silly, who is he? I don't even know who you're talking about. This guy like a mold. I think it is. Who is he? I didn't know this. I think he's a right wing journalist or something. I don't. Oh, nick caught him. Ended up tentacle porn. Does that wouldn't, I guess it was in his search history or something. Did you find that story about, well, there's someone that I know, I know I have that devalued story.

Speaker 2:          02:09:45       Like someone said, it was definitely something, but uh, but it didn't not, you know, but the thing is this, this is the point in like if we got into a future where literally everyone's going to know everything about everyone, then nothing's really going to matter about any person. I mean, they seem like, well, yeah, everyone does this, you know, you know, you know exactly who does this. So it's not gonna be shameful. Nothing to be shameful, nothing and be shocking. Everyone would just know. Everyone knows everything about everyone all the time. Yeah. That's the real worry. Right. And they were going to become okay here. Right here. Okay. The fake news. Here it is. I'll tell you, I found it so easy, Jamie. So sad at your skills. Um, it says fake news of fatal car crash wiped out 4 billion in, here's the company, e three m a. E. T. H. No, that's Bitcoin coin. That's like a cryptocurrency. Uh, that's, you didn't find it. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:10:34       I didn't know what that was. That's a new one. Yeah. Oh God. Okay. So fake news of fatal. It's on courts. Um, qz.com yeah. Wiped out that $4 billion in their market value yesterday. How the fuck they at $4 billion in market value of a Crypto coin that I've never even heard of. No idea. So cryptic. I'd see what x. So that's, I mean it's still I guess as legitimate as stock Jesus Christ and if there's $4 billion in value to it, that's as legitimate as a company about it. Some legitimacy point being that a fake news story wiped out the value of it, but maybe now's the time to buy. All right. Well yeah, if it's got no value and it's probably going to go back up cause this wasn't a real thing about it again in ground pool dive in, take a chance. I didn't make it well that you got it.

Speaker 1:          02:11:22       What does it take story about the guy that created it died in a car crash. Oh everybody panel. Then everyone panicked because the creator, God, it's controlling the money in the market of it supposedly died. Well that didn't happen. Oh, okay. But still hot attack for him though. Oh, by the way, you'll stuff's going down $4 billion. Watson. I know, right? Can you even imagine the other weird part? It's not stock. It's a, Oh, what's the value of marketing? That's another one of my favorite stories of the last year. The Fan, oh story. That woman who was a pretending to be the news female Steve Jobs and she had the look, so everybody went with it and she had this blood testing procedure that totally didn't work. Didn't look into it. It's a great story. She was, she was touted as being the next genius. She dressed exactly like Steve Jobs.

Speaker 1:          02:12:12       She wore black turtlenecks and was really hilarious and she gave this speech to like women in something or another, but the speech was so like jumbled and shitty and there's so much poverty of words in our sentences, like the, the content was just so bad. I was like, this is a genius. Like, maybe she's like super awkward and nervous and maybe she just didn't prepare this speech at all, but no, turns out choosing massive fraud things at massive fraud and her $34 billion company vanished. So the company had a product that they were using where they were doing these blood tests and a whistle blower from inside the company said, this person, they're ignoring all the bad data. They were ignoring all the failed tasks that they're pretending it's much more efficient than it is. Right. I'll do it. Not only did, did not work, hundreds of thousands of people who took these tests, oh, we're exposed to potential health threats because they thought, well, this is Heston.

Speaker 1:          02:13:09       They know what I know where my blood is now. So you could have gone, you know, a more cautious or less cautious based on this or got treatment that you didn't need based on this or didn't get treatment that you probably did need based on this. So, uh, they imagined the kind of person who does that though. She's standing there bullshitting. I'm sociopath was at risk sociopath in, in some sort of a way. Um, some or unless she was lied to too. I mean, who knows exactly what the actual story is you've got. But the, the, the whistleblower saying no, she's absolutely aware of it. And so now she's, she went from being like the number one self made female entrepreneur ever where she was worth like $34 billion or something crazy to massive debt. Now our company is worth nothing. It doesn't work. So she fired a shit load of people and the company still exists as an entity, but it's, it's like one of those really tortured things.

Speaker 1:          02:14:01       There's lawsuits are flying around left and right now, but the whole story is a cautionary tale and like what, what we're looking for, we're looking for this thing, this new image. You know, here's this woman, she's fitting the part. She's got a black turtleneck on. She con artist came along and played, you dropped out of college at 19 to start this business. I mean, she doesn't know. She doesn't even have a background in medical science. She's not like, she doesn't have a degree. It's not like she's a phd and some sort of bioengineering or blood testing or whatever the fuck it would be. Yeah, it's a, it's a crazy story because she was saying, hey, exactly as drastic part. Look, the part said the right words, confidence, tricks to comes along and says, Hey, you're interested in a woman doing this. I'm a woman. I'm doing this.

Speaker 1:          02:14:47       I remember before she get exposed, watching that video of her talking going, this not seem like a smart, yeah. If she's just like rambling along and kind of disjointed or something. It was just clunky. Yeah. Like pull up CV. You could find Elizabeth. Is that her name? Stan knows what the fuck was her name. I forgot what her name is. Theranose was the, what was her name? Looking at pictures ever. It doesn't say her name anywhere, but you know I did. I did hear about it, but I'll, I'll have to check it out some of the time. Yeah, but it's, look again, this is, what's that? Elizabeth Holmes? Yeah. Okay, so not, it's not discrediting women. This is not discrediting the idea of a genius woman. This is not discrediting the idea of a genius entrepreneurial woman. What this is fascinating to me is a person who fits all of these categories that people are clearly looking for.

Speaker 1:          02:15:37       Yeah. Right. And they just boil into x is what the answer is. Identity politics. Because confirmation bias, and we love the fact that it's strong woman is doing this. It's amazing. It's just true. I'm with her Hashtag they went with the Marine Le Pen though. Where they, who's that? Oh, the French woman. Oh, that's right. Yeah. Well that's the thing, isn't it? Oh, well you know, I mean, I know that she's the woman, but I'm filling for Alexander macron. Yeah, but Yo, I'm with her on you, right? Oh, you know, I'm with her when she thinks wrong. So it's not that she's a woman, it's the way she fucking thinks. Why can't we just be honest about this? You know that Merck hell ladies a trip to, oh, Michael's cancer. She's, I can't believe the judge Germany get rid of Merkel. Well, what are you doing? What are you doing? She's a trip. When I know about her, if I know who's running Germany, the gentleman's just can't help themselves. What are they doing over there? Uh, with wall with her.

Speaker 2:          02:16:30       That's an Ma Ma Merkel's I speak to you again. My friend crowd, he tells me about these things. She's famous for her and I don't want to say flip flopping, but I would like, I would actually be a little more charitable than say her. Um, her navigation of the political wins. Hillary in that way, I guess why she uses is an opportunist. Another one. I think it's unfair to call opportunists cause that's sailors really, really, it's being a smart politician, isn't it? It's saying well, okay. What, I mean, where are people going that's important, that smarter anymore? Well, no, I think it, I think it means you lack credibility. It makes you look like you don't stand for anything. Well look, as much as trump lies and he's, he lied all the 600 plus times in the hundred plus times that he was in office. They did a count of all the times he said things that weren't true publicly.

Speaker 2:          02:17:20       As much as he does that. Everybody knows that's what he does. Like they know who he is. They know what he does. They know he tweets all the time. So even if he tweets something ridiculous, they know who that is. That's that guy. That's him. That's what he really thinks. That's why he's saying it. You never got that with Hillary Clinton, which you got is these weird boiled down messages. It seemed like they were put together in some sort of a of a writer's room. Yeah, it was. I mean, she doesn't control its twitter account. No. Doubtedly but trump undoubtedly is in control of his and 200% it's so hilarious. I thought it was hilarious. She wrote to him, delete your account. Yes. That's nice. Legit banter. It's good. That was good. Got to give it up to her there, but I don't know who wrote that was probably some 20 year old kid somewhere.

Speaker 2:          02:18:05       She probably wrote it. Yeah. Gursky's work at four 12 guys. Who knows? Yeah. She for the social media manager at Wendy's tweeted out, pepe the of the Wendy's icon as a peppy oh no, shit. Stolen, absolute shit on. They were forced to delete it. And who knows what? That person still has a job, but people who think that pepe is outright and you're saying Pepsi's not outright. They all right, use pam pay. But everyone uses pepe. Pepe is a ubiquitous internet symbol, sort of dissonance and chaos. More importantly, um, disrespect, but isn't keck like the god of chaos or sensate up, uh, this little made up, made up. What I think is makeup. It's like, what if you die and you meet Keck? Would you be feeling bad? Cause you said he was made up. I'll be quite surprised. I'd be like, okay, you're going to have to work with me here because let's be honest.

Speaker 2:          02:18:55       Would you have believed it? No. No, but yeah, that would be so shocked if he let her gold robe. It was a frog and you got to have an oncology and there's, there's, it literally looks like pepe then that he's got a gold robe on. Can I piss off? Like literally everyone who believes in a religion, why would you want to? Because what about hope? Doesn't it just struck you as in this childish fucking thing that depends on what I'm going to go somewhere. Is Nino not scientology that that's starting to make sense to me. I can tell actually, but I, like I said up, been watching but said no, seriously. It's obviously wishful thinking and it's obvious because you're afraid of dying and it's obviously that you just want to believe it. It's not true. You fucking might just want that gold metal and that is not true.

Speaker 2:          02:19:39       I want that scientology gold medal that gave Tom cruise the big one, like a laptop. It looks like flavor flavor up there with that fucking gold medal on. Isn't it so arrogant to think that humans are so important that they're going to go to an afterlife? It might be right. You know the, the afterlife isn't that arrogant to me because it's the idea is that like you're trying to just pass on life, right? And the mind understands that this is sort of a few tile effort. You're temporary. You have a finite life, you know, like what, what are you doing? Why, why even bother? I just end this now you're constantly suffering. Just jump off a building. So no, no, no. We can't do that because there's a greater good waiting for us. There's a greater thing. There's another level of the video game that doesn't make sense if, if, if you're going to go to heaven when you dunk, kill yourself, but you can't.

Speaker 2:          02:20:32       That's a loophole. So you can't go to heaven. Yeah, kill yourself. You make the people around you that loved you suffer. So you don't go to heaven when you kill yourself. That's convenient. Or it's God's plan. They kill you. What? Where's your part of the Colt, Richard? And I'm like, you know, we'll just gonna drink the Koolaid, the prism cooling and kill cells. Well, they answered that with Jesus. Jesus on the cross. That's why we still do this. We literally make the, make the cross sign that the thing that killed him. B Bill Hicks had a great joke about that. He goes, it's like going up to Jackie on the assets with a rifle on. He was just thinking of John Jackson. Imagine if you'd like a pagan or something back in like the seventh century or whatever and you're, you're, you know, northern European Lithuanian or something and then these Germans coming in and go, hey, we've got this religion about dead guy.

Speaker 2:          02:21:18       We think you should join it. We blog. Why? Well it's, it's really sad. It's really sad story. But he died for your sins. But yeah, every way you go. This guy just being killed on the cross. He was like, you know, my religion is way more fun than that. Yeah. You have the original sin too. That's the great thing that you brought up earlier about being white. I mean it's sort of like just being a human. The original sin, the only way they can have complete total control over you is to say that you are guilty no matter what. Just by virtue of being born believing of guilty if then it works. Yeah. It starts from that, that this all knowing infinite thing that looks over the universe is incredibly petty. Very jealous if you, if you, yeah. If you go well that's worship. Anything else, any other false idols?

Speaker 2:          02:22:02       DEF You wear two different types of clothes. Death. Yeah. You know, it's, it's um, really interesting cause there there've been religions in the past that thought that that was an evil God, the crate to the earth and everything in the F is created by an evil God and there is a loving God beyond it, but you can't pray to it and has no interaction. Yeah. The Yoni, you got to get past earth yet basically you have to live a good life. And eventually Ocala, well maybe it's true. Maybe it's like this is a level of the video

Speaker 1:          02:22:26       game, right? Maybe you get past those. No. What if it did you get through and that's awesome. I'll put money on it. It's not worth anything in the afterlife, sir. Okay. Okay, well I'll put whatever you want on it. Right. And in the US I say, and if it's true in the afterlife, all blue, but the absolute no one has in the afterlife. But you're like in a few real being, you're like 70 failure. I know Matt Dude, Dude, dude, I do. Now I've had, I've had a near death experience, man, I've been there, man. It's obviously such wishful thinking that says they know as soon as someone says, yeah, I know what happens. Even if you say I know that you die and there's nothing, well you definitely don't. You definitely don't know. Don't know. But if I'm going to put money on it, I mean like I would definitely wouldn't put money on it because the money's useless when your dad, but I mean like now you know?

Speaker 1:          02:23:13       Yeah but tomorrow, no, no, it's not for me. Tomorrow they might be able to prove it. The amazing tomorrow if you get to a betting agency it's like, well actually scientists have discovered the God is real and it turns out that there are 72 virgins waiting in heaven. So maybe you just convert to Islam now. You know you blow shit. Okay. And low walk. Did you ever see that priest that got in trouble because he took photos of him in heaven and he was selling photos of him and heaven is wonderful. It's him like waving and he's in this pure white background and he said, I put it on my toy, it's on my, my instagram account from a while back as such. But you could find a jamie. It's hilarious. He's funny. He's, I mean he's, it's, it's, it's adorable because he's so fucking stupid.

Speaker 1:          02:24:01       Like the thing is so fucking stupid that it makes you just go. It's like that. Um, I just found out about this too the other day drawn Horton, uh, told me about the 18 year old kid that, uh, was running a medical practice and he did not have a, any medicine was chiropractor basically, but they, they busted him and he sat down and gave interviews and said that he's being persecuted. And so all of the true facts will come to light, but it's the way it's edited is so funny. I mean, it's really, really funny. I mean, this guy has a loon, this kid like sounds it. Yeah. Did you find the photo of the guy in heaven?

Speaker 1:          02:24:41       There he is. He's got his hand up. This is a full version of it where you could see like more of them with, yeah, it's like that, but it's all just, it's not that it's white. It's not a fake one. Oh, it's whatsapp. $5,000 for one. Yeah. He was charging people for the photo of him in heaven and he was, I guess he was going to sign it. You mentioned what kind of more on you'd have to be. Yes. Look at this. Look at the quote. I just want to bless everyone with the experience. I had talked with Jesus. He's a great guy. Showed me a lot of love. I can't wait to get back up there with him.

Speaker 3:          02:25:24       That's it. You met the king of kings. You met the son of God. You met her and this is what he says. He says he's a great guy. He showed me a lot of love. Oh, well for sure. It sounds like you had a real transcendent experience with Jesus. He's a great guy. He pictures on his galaxy smartphone. He brought his fucking Samsung up into heaven was Paul. That's, that's basically [inaudible] stories based on a lot of the time, you know, so someone was, you know, like Enoch was taken up into the crystal ship of God or Holy Shit, it's just whole shit made up by idiots thousands of years ago. I don't know what's going on. They can't explain what's going on, but they are kind of scared of getting killed. And that's because it might really happen really fucking soon. Let's get rid of us. You know, they're talking about an oral tradition.

Speaker 3:          02:26:14       Like those todd talked for thousands of years and then by the time someone wrote it down, yeah. It wasn't the original Bible like a thousand years old by the time anybody wrote it down a well and validly that was, I mean we don't know how old, cause there was an old, I don't even know. Right. Come from anybody, you know, will also, when you hear like the similarities between like the Sumerian tech stories like oh yeah, the epic of Gilgamesh is smear. Yeah. Really similar to Noah's Ark. Oh yeah, yeah. The pitched him who, uh, you know, survived the flood and whatnot. And in fact, it's like really so similar. It's like the, the, it's almost the same words, just replacing God with gods while they oversee from by God's with God. And uh, I'm the things we can even pinpoint the sort of time there's likely to have been adopted into the religion during the Babylonian Exxon.

Speaker 3:          02:26:58       When the Assyrians conquered the nation of Israel and left Judah, they undoubtedly that they took them back to all the series of Babylonians under Nebuchadnezzar, took them back to Babylon and then they're the, they're the smart Jews were the elite, the educated people. And unsurprisingly, suddenly the myths includes loads of Mesopotamia. My ideas. Well, what did that come from? Genius. You know? And then they go back and so all of a sudden, okay, it's cool incorporated. Okay. Yeah. It's, this is a whole shit. It's all bull shit and there's no benefit into really trying to include the older stuff that they find each other and try to like figure out whether or not these are connected. Stupid. It's just like, I mean it's just like, there are so many golds. Why that one? Why that one? You don't know, probably cause you grew up with it, right.

Speaker 3:          02:27:42       You weren't reasoned until that ability you went, you, you weren't reasonable and positioning, you didn't send anything. You know, I've had a think and I think it's melodic. That's, I was thinking about it. I was thinking Tmr yeah, it was wild. It tame amount you couldn't really have, cause that's like a primordial God. But that's how I like, I like the old ones. Yeah. But they don't then, you know, you couldn't pray Tim outside Krom No pray to crime. He doesn't listen. He doesn't. But no, I mean I like Asher to be honest. You know, wished her. But um, you know, it's just like, it's nonsense. It's all nonsense. It's all a myth. And it's fascinating. And what's interesting to me is the historical idea that these people were living by these stories like thousands of years ago.

Speaker 2:          02:28:22       And like what? Like you try to put it in context. Imagine what it would be like living thousands of years ago with no science, with no education and limited understanding of the world around you. And then there you are abiding by these ancient stories. And it's a fascinating thing, like the Dead Sea Scrolls. That's really fascinating stuff because they've been dave and deciphering that forever. But they don't incorporate it into the Christian doctrine. No, it's not. It's not a party to codify to Kong revisit it. What did they do about that? Because if they know that that's ancient religious text and it's as old as anything that they've found, right. It's the oldest version of the Bible. It's old as fuck. Yeah. And these, you know, they don't use it. Yeah, exactly. Weird. But let's, cause they'd have to change the beliefs and they went reasoned into these beliefs. So they're gonna be like, no, I don't have, they just ignore it.

Speaker 2:          02:29:11       They've got a narrative. They just ignore it. I wonder what they did, what the official position of like the Catholic church is about. Like the Dead Sea Scrolls. I don't give a shit with the Catholic Church says I'm fascinating. Well, yeah, but one thing that, um, oh, I was gonna say, one thing that bugs me about fit is, um, I'll come up. I was gonna say answering, how does this pull, you brought the Catholic church. You got to, we blew a fuse and my brother Catholic churches, I, yeah, just, just super bummed out about them. They say the Catholic church, his whole shit. Oh, it certainly is this, this is my problem with, and it's just like, I mean, if someone wants to believe in stuff, that's fine. This is one. Secularism is important, you know, it's, I butts, it's like identitarian politics, you know? It's just a tender mass to get.

Speaker 2:          02:29:53       But let me tell you about my ex, you know, but you're just talking about yourself, right? You know, you don't talking about a problem that's external to you. You're saying I have a problem. I believe something. I believe in God. I believe that black people are this. I believe that white people this, I mean, yeah, but I didn't, we can't, you know, tell me, tell me about the things that are external to you that actually are affecting things you know in you rather than things that are in you that are coming out. I don't care about that. You've got this the wrong way round. I just find it fascinating that there's like a certain level of like when you go back in time, there's a certain level of history, like they way you just ignore those ideas. Like when you get past 4,000 years old, like an epic of Gilgamesh is no one just trying to live by the Sumerian texts.

Speaker 2:          02:30:34       There's no one as treating that as a religion. Right? Yeah. The ancient Mesopotamian stories are basically thought of is purely myths. Yeah. Just like Odin and thor and zoom, that's all abandoned. But at one point in time, that was the ideology to live. I liked the way that God's never really get resurrected and I, I don't really believe the neo pagans and stuff like this, so I actually believe in this night. Don't you just think it's cool? They think it's cool. Yeah. Yeah. Weekend. Yeah. And not wicked. Wicked. It is not like old either. That's like a knee. That was like 19th century or something to allow that was invented. Oh, that's even dumber. Yeah, I know. Isn't there, it's like the oldest version of the Mormons. Yeah. Oh, I love them all. And this was it Joseph Smith, is it? Yeah. Yeah. Dies in a gun fight or something like in a prison

Speaker 3:          02:31:19       as like, that's my kind of profit. Well, you know, he's thinks it out when he was 14. Yeah. There's golden place and no one got sauce. Good stuff. I mean, who do you know that's 14 that isn't full of shit. Have you ever had a 14 year old tells you the truth and they were like this little lying all the time, but know things. Yeah. This boy has wisdom. Where did you learn this wisdom? A golden tablet. Come with me. I'll show you where it is. The angels knew we were coming and they took it away. Well, I'm persuaded. Um, what do you have your magic caesarstone Oh no, they took that as well. God, it's so close. So close. Yeah. But they did tell me before they left that I could have nine whys when you pitch just once, getting lost. You know, one of my favorite thing about the Quran and the Hadith says is a Mohammed basically, he used to pull these fucking dictates from God, abs us.

Speaker 3:          02:32:10       And at one point his child bride turn around to him and said, you know, paraphrasing, but uh, you know, these are coming at surprisingly convenient times for you, ma'am. It's like, oh, he got called out by your child bride magnet because it's obvious you pulling this shit out of your ass for your own convenience. It's just like, and there were some really gross things about Mohammed as well. I better not go and took some will probably kill me. Isn't that amazing? That you believe would have to worry about that? Yeah. Legit. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, people who have a mocked since we've got some time anyway, we were on the subject of Islam. I think it's worth talking about. Wahhabism I've been learning about that a lot. Okay. Um, it's crazy and Muslims hate it. It's like the sjws of the Muslim world. Imagine if the country was taken over by rabid sjws who had access to weaponry me.

Speaker 3:          02:33:02       Scary, right? Yeah. Imagine if they had in every city like sjw, police, he went around saying, right, blacks over here, whites over there, men over here, women over here. And if you were even caught fraternizing with the opposite race or sex, that's it. You're going to get the lash or maybe you get your hand chopped off for me, you know, whatever punishment in sexual social justice would meet out if given the option. That's basically what it was like in Saudi Arabia that under isis. So it really is in a lot of ways, a lot of things that we've been talking about today, they're very similar. And if these were deep grooves that are human to, and I imagine the kind of person who wants to be the person who enforces that right piece of shit. That's why these social justice warriors, a piece of shit that's control freaks, a control, fixed moral busybodies.

Speaker 3:          02:33:49       I've got no real morals at all. And people who lack a certain amount of objectivity, which is why that certain lady you kept talking about earlier feels like she can say those terrible things about you. But she caught herself. Yeah. Yup. And I wrote ugly. Everything they're saying is projection. I mean, who's who's doing the abusing, who's doing all of this? It's not me. You know, it's, none of this is really true. But um, yeah, the, the Islamic world, the, the well hobbies. It was really, I've read a fulsome fanaticism by Sunday Ross Valentine and English professor who went and lived down Saudi Arabia for three years to learn about the radiology. Really, really, really fascinating. Um, one of the, one of the most fascinating things is how much other Muslims don't like the hobbies. And I'm using the term a hobby, but it's, it's a school of Islamic thought called Salafism and it can best be described as autistic screeching.

Speaker 3:          02:34:42       It's like taking a really hard line interpretation, ignoring other arguments against this line interpretation and going, you know what, just no, not even listening. And then just carrying on and seeing where that train of logic guests you and suddenly it gets to religious police Sunday guess to throwing gays off buildings and stuff on the regular Muslims don't need to do because [inaudible] you know, they'll be like, well, not pro gay. I mean, this is another ent, but Mohammed says, don't kill people, you know, at one point, at some point in the Koran he says, and so they, they kind of say, right, okay, well I'm not going to kill someone. You know, I mean, okay, maybe the gay thing was wrong. So a lot of Muslims [inaudible] pro death centers for sexuality, but you know, the, you know, they'll have, I mean, everything's reasoned. Everything is argumentation, right?

Speaker 3:          02:35:24       And so the important thing is to understand that they are persuaded into becoming jehad jihadis. And it's not, and this is one thing the West has to understand. It is not that we're at war with them, right? You can go to isis is like they, they produce magazines. Uh, there was one called Dabiq, which was a city, they owned a but they lost it. So they created a new one called [inaudible], which is Rome, what they, Arabic for Rome that they have conquered before and not isis, but Islam and want to conquer again. And then, then they literally say in, I can't really think it was like [inaudible] or something. They literally turn around and say, we do not fight you because your bond, the Middle East, we fight you because you are not Muslims and no, it's not because you bombed the Middle East. Even if you stopped bombing Middle East, we will fight you until we become Muslims.

Speaker 3:          02:36:15       This is why we do it. Don't get me wrong, you bombing the Middle East isn't making us like you anymore. You know we're going to keep doing it. We find you because you insult Muhammad, we find you because you don't believe in allowing. There's profit in the last day. This is why we fight. You do not misunderstand and they literally address the liberal or the progressive's or you know, whatever you'd like to call them. They're literally talking to these people saying, don't think that we're crazy and we don't know. We just, this is what we believe. You are cancer and we want to exterminate you basically, and you get the sjws going. Wow. I mean, it's kind of went bowling. The music man, American foreign policy knows nothing to do with that. It's all about the argumentation. Even if we will just peaceful peace loving people who did nothing, they would still be like, well I lost, told me to cut your head off.

Speaker 3:          02:36:57       I mean, but again, this is a small minority who are widely despised by other Muslims. I mean the like for example, if you went to a Christian school and everyone would probably be fairly chill, you know, you still going to like, you know, Catholic school or something and most people you talk to, they'll be fairly chill. But in every group of people you'd have a couple people who would be the sort of people watching you and if you start doing something, they'd go and get the nuns and, and they, and they get whack, you know, a day, you know that they are those people. It's just for Islam. They ended up going and killing things because in Islam you told right, if you, if you die, and this is another thing that drives me crazy, they're like, oh, the nine 11 hijackers with drinking and carousing and, and doing drugs, they're obviously not real Muslims now.

Speaker 3:          02:37:38       You fucking idiots. They think they're having all of their sins expunged the second they die in the surface of a lot. This is what martyrdom is. No matter what you've done, you go to heaven and get your virgin. So why wouldn't you do whatever the fuck you like? They have a free pass because they know they've got a day. Exactly. So that's what they do. And so when they're like, oh, isis aren't ready, Islamic cause look at they're doing at least on his long things. No, they know they're going to die and they, well yeah, in the logic of the theology that they live under, um, they think they get, they're going to die and that they're going to get out of rescinded Alyson remission of sins. Isn't that the most fascinating? Part of it is just the things that people are willing to believe [inaudible] had been rezoned into it by.

Speaker 3:          02:38:20       If you take like say, right, I believe that the crime is the word of God and I believe that her deaths in the center of the actual sayings and doings of the habit and you believe these things true then then you're building from certain base and you need to, and basically it's how you construct arguments and if you start leaving out parts of what otherwise is like a regular Muslim sort of theological argument, um, then you ended up building like a weird tower over here. This starts going off. You know, the arguments are constructing themselves off to the left rather than staying reasonably central. I mean, like most Muslims are never going to become terrorists because they don't artistically believe that a bunch of things just aren't true just because they don't want them to be true. You know, they don't, they're not cherry picking from the Koran as much as the way to the extent that the wahabiists or Salafis and they will build it in general.

Speaker 3:          02:39:04       Do y'all know they, they hate, do you know what the watchword is, is the dumbest thing in the world? There'll be no more innovations wide. No more innovations. Mohammed was the perfect man. We must live like Mohammed. Therefore, I mean like you, you would not believe how dumb this is. You, this is really part of their doctrine. Yes. It's called Bita. He'd be bid a, I think it might have an h on it. I'm not sure. Uh, but I don't speak Arabic. And the idea is that there are no vacation, not have any innovation. No. What about the innovation that they already use? Like Toyota trucks? Yeah, the, the, the like for example, the King King of sound had a hell of a time. Right? Okay. So Saudi Arabia was founded by the even sowed family in conjunction with Abdul Hub. It was a known in light, the late 18th century.

Speaker 3:          02:39:56       Uh, he was unknown a theologian and he was, he was a brilliant man, but he was, I come from a better way of putting it in an autistic because he, he was, he was very focused, hyper focused on a single sort of stress strand of thought and everything that he thought was either black or white, there was no gray in between. Right. I know I'm, I mean, I literally mean he may well have had autism, right? Just use it as an insult. He may well have literally had awesome zero those, either this or nothing at all. You know? And so he ends up building this theology and it's not, it's not bad. Well, I met, and I know that's a little wrong with some of those not, there's not bad. It's not that, it's not like, it's not that there isn't an argument there. There obviously must be an argument there, otherwise people wouldn't believe it.

Speaker 3:          02:40:35       Right. But you're getting me really confused. Okay. What might be an argument otherwise people won't believe what he's saying and the, his interpretation of the Koran and Islam and you know, all of this, he's got a particular interpretation and he says to someone, Hey, you should follow my interpretation of Islam cause I'm actually got the right interpretation of Islam. Okay. And, uh, and most people were like, no, you know, you're, you're ignoring almost everything, you know, and that's fine, but what does that have to do with innovation? Right. Well, that's the thing like Beeda is ha, you know, harmful innovations and but they don't run harmful innovations are bad by definition. But there were also good innovations. So the telephone, you know, the cars, all that sort of stuff, these kids are good innovations are so the Muslims are free to use them. The hobbies, I imagine now this point, they've been persuaded that they are okay.

Speaker 3:          02:41:26       But um, when like for example, uh, even salad first tried to explain to them, look, we need guns. And you know, we ended up at a maximum gun. We planes we need when he bombs and bullets and cars, all of these now televisions and satellite dishes and all the sorts of thing. They were actively resistant to this because of the whole, Mohammed didn't have this and he had these things called I warriors. I'm probably pronouncing that horribly. So apologies. Anyone who knows how to pronounce these words cause I haven't ever seen written down. Um, but these guys were like Isis, the, the, I mean, the way Saudi Arabia was formed is exactly the same way as isis has been. The Islamic state has been formed now. Exactly the same. These guys were the most brutal man you've ever seen. And they would just go in and murder entire villages, right.

Speaker 3:          02:42:13       He had 150,000 of these people, you know, like that. He used to conquer what is now Saudi Arabia. And eventually he was like, I want a car. I think planes, good idea. And they were like, no, no. And so they revolted against him. And the British seeing him as a useful client decided to help him out with a few macs and guns and if you'd like, you know, biplanes or something. So they revolted against him because he wanted a car. Yeah, because it's on Islamic Ma'am and Nevada. A, uh, the British killed mill, which was probably, honestly, it was probably a good thing for the world. Don't get me wrong, because these guys were nuts. They would regularly just, I mean, and this is the thing that, it's another thing they've got is the tech theory doctrine. You're not a real Muslim. That's an interesting thing, isn't it?

Speaker 3:          02:42:58       And it's, it's interesting how we do that to them. We tack fear them. You're not a real must be the wind on a position to tell anyone who's a real Muslim or not. You know, if they consider themselves Muslims and Muslim and let me, they like literally they are the most Muslim in their opinion and their opinion. Nobody else's a real Muslim and therefore it's okay to kill them. You can only, you only have to give a shit about actual Muslims under this doctrine. Again, this is not what most Muslims think. This is the antithesis of what most Muslims actually think. And so these guys used to like in a huge rating that you have to qualify that. Like you have to stand up and say, I know, you know the other nutty shit is not as naughty as this nutty shit. Yeah. And, and just just while we're on the subject, right?

Speaker 3:          02:43:37       Islam is Towsley in liberal, a Western liberal country should never defend Islam in it's, this sounds very islamophobic of you. Exactly. And it's been used a lot. Phobic comps and Louis, I would never, I would hate you would hate to live in Sharia law. Well, you might not want, not you personally, but as a man you would to an entirely benefit from living on the shelf for real. How so? The girls have to walk around like beekeepers, right? Not always that. That's actually not, how do you know what they really look? That's actually, that's actually not in the Koran. It just says be modest. Right. You know, you could just wear a headscarf, isn't it? If you like an internet, Ho monist is like chance shorts. Yeah. And if you're, if you're an autistic isis member that's full on burger with a grill of your face.

Speaker 3:          02:44:19       So this, what's interesting about this conversation, the, the thing would be like for example, in the legal system, directly out to the Quran, women, a woman's testimony is worth half of a man's in the legal system, in the legal, so that they use that legal system like they use the Koran forced the losses. It's based on sharia. So if a woman says something like, Oh, Sargon raped me and you'd be like, pitch and we need a female witness. Yeah, he has two point you didn't, you'd need more than one. You know, we did another female witness to testify it. Yeah. And even then it was pop by, she had a half a woman for the west of that. This is entirely, entirely possible that the judge would punish her for tempting me. Yeah. Because like if she has a half an opinion and then the other chickens that half an opinion, that's still only like one person.

Speaker 3:          02:45:03       One person's a woman. Yeah. This one's for the whole thing. I mean about women are entitled to half of the inheritance money managers and title. That was the other half go to the any brothers will, you know anything like that. If you're a lone sibling then you, okay. That was my only child then. Yeah, you're fine obviously. But like if you've got a male sibling, you'll get half of what he goes. Pretty horrible isn't it? But yeah. And this is just like the most moral thing. And like the legal system is basically about a bounce as useful as Hammurabi's code of laws where you know, an eye for an eye tooth for a tooth. I mean that was outdated 2000 years ago in West, you know with the infant Jesus. It's been, no, no, it is. Let me see. It's, it's really brutal stuff and it's just like, okay, well I mean any progressive, whoever advocates for anything positive about Islam is an idiot and doesn't understand Islam. They've got, I mean I've, I've seen them going Islams, ms feminist religion. Yeah. If you want to be made a second class citizen, it is absolutely. If that's what you want feminism to be, the installation of a systemic oppression against women. Sure. That can be feminism if you like. And that really is revealing about feminism, isn't it? What is going lately with this

Speaker 1:          02:46:10       weird sort of acceptance of, how do you say, Hey job, how do you say that the head gear head, you know, offends me more than anything. Right. But what's going on with that? There's this weird thing where women are like being empowered. They're pretend I'm the fuck up, but they're pretending they're empowered by this and that this is their own choice. This is a feminist value. Unbelievably stupid, but very common. If you seen it. One thing that I, I've never, I never really saw myself as sole person who gets offended, but when I see an American flag, his job, I find that offense come on. They have those. Oh yeah, I know. I let you look at and get, no, this is the antithesis of what these files. That seems like something a biker would wear. It sounds like. It sounds like a parody, but then American, that's really what it is. Maybe like one of them duck dynasty phase. Maybe. Maybe. Maybe. Maybe. I've been fooled. Oh my God is not just the symbol of liberty. Cover yourself up.

Speaker 7:          02:47:07       Wow.

Speaker 1:          02:47:09       Cover your fucking hair up. You. So she, she wearing that to show that she's very American when trump is saying that he wants to shut down mosques. Yeah. Did you see that whole Megan Kelly thing with Alex Jones? I saw that a, he scooped a, but to be fair, I mean Alex probably did say a lot of crazy shit and he'd probably say they live by a little crazy shit, didn't they? Well, he's in the past. He said definitely some crazy shit about sandy hook and, but she was saying he never expected to ever be famous. Uh, I've known Alex A. Long time. It's not that, it's just that he's just the build a budget, always looking for conspiracies. Like when you think you know for sure that some things for sure that some a conspiracy when you don't really know for sure. You're just saying it and then you just run with it.

Speaker 1:          02:47:56       When you're talking about children's lives, it's very dangerous. It's a horrible, you better have some bloody convincing proof and he's abandoned. Abandoned that. Yeah. But he hasn't abandoned it and apologize for saying it. He's like the, what he's done is like made this sort of like, uh, he's, he's sort of like made some, some, some video where he's talking to the parents directly and saying that he couldn't imagine he feels their pain and I'm terrible for, I feel very sorry for your loss, but it doesn't go saying, I'm sorry I supported a hoax. That's not true. That says you were liars and your children were never killed. Yeah. You know, there was a really crazy story that I read about a guy who was a conspiracy theorist and then his own son was murdered and then he realized, Holy Shit, in Sandy Hook, he realized like, Oh my God, this is how insane these conspiracy theories are.

Speaker 1:          02:48:52       There's people that are, that are, there's a whole movement right now where they think that polio was a massive hopes and that what polio was, was them injecting people with the polio vaccine because there was no polio and then injecting with as the vaccine, they hurt all these people. As someone who has been fooled before, I can tell you the, any solution is education. You've got. Yeah. You can't just, you can't just tell these people that are idiots and never told to them cause they'll just think, well you don't have anything to rebut me with Flatiron, right? Yeah, exactly. The floods, you've got engaged with these people. I mean, that's way it'd be popular these days. It's like what the fuck do you think the satellites are for? Why put that Elan Musk thing up and they seen that Ilan Mustang I put on instagram. Should check this out, pull this up.

Speaker 1:          02:49:32       Elon musk posted something about space x and now they're there. They're shooting. They can shoot something in the space now and then land it on a pad and figured out how to do that. And so they sped up a sped up version. So instead of taking an hour or whatever it takes to get up there and get back. But check this out. Like look how beautiful that looks when they come in down in the earth, but then go watch. But why doesn't the world full of joy? I don't know, but check this out the water. It does. So watch how this thing lands. This is really kind of crazy. Boom. From that nuts fucking out, right? Yeah. That's incredible dude. Elon Musk for president. Wow. I didn't know about his politics but I mean that's, you know, must've built shit. It's amazing. But look at that fucking video of the earth.

Speaker 1:          02:50:18       So all these dip shits in the comments. I knew I was going to put it up cause it's awesome. It's awesome. I'm going to put it up, whether or not dipshits think the earth is flat or not, but it's, you clearly see the fucking circle these to the curve of the earth and um, there's so many people in the comments so you could see George Foods really believed that. Bro, you're such a solo show out, bro. Why do we have satellites? What's the point? I mean there's no salary. They don't think their satellites, but you can see them loans you've done? No, no, no, no, no, no. They're flying around in planes. Okay. Why can't you see the sun at anytime of the day or night? Why can't you? Yeah, because the sun goes around behind the flat earth. No, it doesn't make any sense. Why are you saying it like, like you were looking for a rational explanation, but that's the thing, isn't it?

Speaker 1:          02:51:05       Because if let's say, you know, this is the flood, the ice wall, they say about it like it's like a under like a fucking, like a spotlight. Right? And it's for some reason rotating around it, but it's like, well, at any point I should be able to put it in. Got to look at this. The Sun is just shining downwards. You know, you have a poor understanding of flat earth theory, sir. I think I probably do. It's all that is. You're absolutely right. But yeah, the only way to, any way to get rid of these things, just to educate people you can't ridicule because they're not, they're not necessarily being irrational, that just dumb. But it's like everything else. We've talked about what people have an idea in their head and then they dig their heels in the sand. And here's the thing. Once you've publicly said you think the earth is flat, and once you've said that, like you have to sort of stick with your guns.

Speaker 1:          02:51:48       Well, cause if you come out and say, I'm sorry, I'm so stupid. I really did believe these fucking idiots on youtube. Instead of believing actual astrophysicist, actual people who were involved in the fields of cartography, airline travel, shipping routes. I mean Jesus fucking Christ. You can go on and on and on about satellites, aerospace, engineering, all the different people that probably would have to be in cahoots. And let me tell you about the wall of ice. The walls, there's a photo of it. Someone sent to me. You fucking idiot. There's the wall. It's like it's 10 feet high. That's a good piece of shit. I watched the video by some, by some of the Youtube App and uh, some here too. Like the problem man, fucking youtubers is a law. It is a part of the bone. But when he, he was like, why do we believe in a flat earth?

Speaker 1:          02:52:33       And I was great. I want to know, you know, that was legitimately exact scenes. One Chem trails. Actually it was the hope big. It was like this. It gives us, I remember we'll talk about big foot. It's a hope. They get it home. It gives them hope, like hope beyond the, the ice wall that are better land exists. And it's like, why would it be any better than what we've got now? Don't you have a photo? You'd dump cons. It's not one guy leaked to fucking camera over to that ice wall. You piece of shit. Can we fly a drone over? Show me that edge. Showing the outside. It's why, why it looks a conspiracy to keep hidden. No can was what it is. People love to know things that other people don't know. They love when they uncovered truth. When there's a secret that someone is hiding about something as monumental as the shape of the earth.

Speaker 1:          02:53:18       People love to be the people in the know. They love to be Hashtag woke that's what happens. And they don't like to read books. No, no, no, they don't. And I think for some of them though, like it, I mean this guy who was saying that it gives us hope and he's like, that's because you don't have any hope. You need something and you're honestly not a religious person. And so you take on this as kind of a religious belief. You, no, no, you're wrong. Listen, a lot of them are religious. That's part of the thing. Part of the whole thing is that evolution is a lie. That's one of the big parts of flat earth theory is that the earth is flat. The firmament breaking the conditioning today. Yeah, man. Listen is a big religious part of this whole thing. Evolution. This is a lie.

Speaker 1:          02:53:56       It's a huge part of the flat earth movement is a belief in creationism. I believe that whole space is not real and then above us is heaven. That we live in a dome now. This is, there's a lot of different factions to the flat earth movement. I'm sure that since, Oh yes, I have, but no, this is a big, a big part of this is a deep belief in, in creationism. Oh, so it's like it's an American Christine thing. Oh yeah. The ones who believe in it also don't believe in dinosaurs. I think dinosaurs are fake. This is wonderful, right? The main guy believes that dinosaurs are fixed by the way. Oh, thanks. Nuclear bombs or hoax. Yes. Nuclear bombs or, oh, what did we drop? Bom, Bom, Bom Bom. Not a big deal. It's just a really a bomb. Nuclear. It's a hoax. Yeah. But this massive hoax, they spent a lot of money. It's just, just really big. Dinosaurs are hooks to bro. Chem trails are real though. Of course there probably could be real jail engineering is a thing. Oh yeah. Like, and so it could actually be right. And I could see the rationale from the government's point of view if they're like, well, a global warming is happening and if we like put extra

Speaker 2:          02:55:03       clouds in the sky, then it'll deflect an excessive amount of the sun's rays and coolio if done well. It does do that. Yeah, exactly. So, but it doesn't mean it was a conspiracy to do that. That's why they're stupid. But yeah, it's no, it's not the, they're not trying to, cause they, you know, I've seen the capture thing. They think what they're trying to like poison people do. So from our stand that that's what happens when a jet engine goes through. Condensation in the air creates these fake clouds. And yes, these fake clouds can cool the earth down a little bit. And in fact they've put them out on purpose, but they're not putting them out on purpose. It just a side effect of air travel. Like they're, they're making these assumptions based on seeing something that sky and thinking someone's spraying something. I wasn't there actually like a Geo engineering thing that was actually something they're doing or planning to do.

Speaker 2:          02:55:44       There is definitely the possibility of one day us having no real protection what no ozone layer there is a possibility. And one of the things that scientists have speculated is that suspending some sort of reflective particles in our atmosphere, like satellites that would somehow or another protect us from solar radiation. So there's something that people thought of him, but for the doing it well for sure someone has thought about doing it. If that's the issue, if we're missing some sort of atmosphere and like, oh, can we create an atmosphere? Yes we can. How would we do it? We'd spray chemicals in the sky. Okay, but that's not what you're seeing when you see those clouds behind jets. It's really simple science. The heat of the jet engine. Yeah. Craig on blocks with a constant. Yeah. The condensation in the atmosphere. It creates a vape. The these artificial clouds, they look like clouds because they are a cloud.

Speaker 2:          02:56:34       Makes perfect sense. But to the armchair conspiracy theorist, it looks up. They like, they're spraying us, man. Yes. Spray. Nice Guy, man. Come on and defend Alex turns for a minute. I love Alex Jones. Yeah, I mean in a, defend them about sandy hook. No, no. I'm going to defend about the frogs. What about the frogs? It's true. They telling me folks. Okay. Oh, they turned frogs. You know, it was really ironic as well. The globalists are telling the frogs gay. Well, there is a, I mean, I'm, I'm actually being literally serious when I say, well, this pollution. Yeah. Yeah. Pollution actually does make the fries. It's corporate malfeasance and it's any, a certain kind of frog and a certain kind of pesticide. I actually read through the study and you played my video on his channel before I have, my video was on my old trying to look and taken down by a metal channel.

Speaker 2:          02:57:16       Got taken down. It was just a little ship hosty channel Dory. But I, but I'm the shit post each channel. We mean just put bullshit on the, Oh bullshit. I found funny and one of the lovely thing was looking into this study, Alex Jones's sighting. So I thought I'd go and get the study actually read it. And he's right kind of right here for example, these people aren't actually globalist. It's like a multinational corporation. People who are actually open borders, they are pro open borders. They're pro pro, you know, corporate influence around the world because they run a giant corporation. The chemicals they're putting in the water technically where actually he wasn't even going far enough. These chemicals were making frogs trans like they would for 90% of the frogs. And it was only a certain chemical, a certain pesticide and it was affecting a certain kind of frog. So, and it, it doesn't, it hasn't made them trans. Well I identify the process. Obviously, I'm

Speaker 1:          02:58:02       not a scientist, but like, um, but I mean if 90 days of finding one and it literally for 90% of the frogs that were touched, some of the, I'll have to check the numbers, but for a large, from the majority of the folks touched it would make them behave in like the soft feminine wave male frogs and make them behave in a feminine way. And for 10% of the frogs touched by this chemical, it would actually send through a process to transform into a fertile female frog. Holy Shit. So it wouldn't be making gay, it was lucy thinking trends. Right. That's not even trans. Right. But that's literally like changing your shoes, your actual sex. Yeah. Yeah. It's literally like transitioning into an actual female. That's actually first I'll say it's better than we can do for human beings. Um, but this, this, this was actually a real thing.

Speaker 1:          02:58:44       It wasn't like an intentional plan to try and turn people into gays or trans or whatever though. And it wasn't, it was done by people who are globalists probably, but it wasn't done as part of a nefarious plot. It was dumb because it was cheaper to just dump the chemicals, you know, office. And it was just an unintended, it's just, it's just ironic going Alex. Alex Jones says, you know, the, the, the globalist supporting chemicals into the water than make friends gay. Well, he ease, right. Well you know, during Desert Storm there was a project that they put together where they were trying to figure out a gay bomb. Yeah. Do you know about that? I had about like the soldiers were about starting like you, well, okay, I'm not feeling very horny. But now I've decided, I like men. They would, they would blow this stuff in the air, blow it up, and it would land down on them and it would transfer them into gay people and they'd be so ashamed that they would stop fighting and lose morale.

Speaker 1:          02:59:31       This was a real consideration they spent, came about the Greeks, didn't they? Yeah, exactly. Cause these guys have fearsomely gay. In fact, with that was a super power to Thebesians scientists develop gay bomb to make enemy soldiers stop fighting. Make love, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude. Two scientists at right laboratory in Dayton, Ohio working to make America's military even mightier made the discovery in 1994 according to the detailed page papers on our, through a freedom of information request and last night they were finally rewarded within what does that Igg, iga or LG ignoble awards. Nobel prize for peace. A spoof of the Nobel prize. Okay. Due to be announced next week, Marc Abrahams, a editor of the animals of the improbable research and the man behind the ignoble awards explained, we don't know if this document was the start and end of it or whatever. In fact, this project continued and perhaps continues to this day.

Speaker 1:          03:00:30       Dot. Dot. Duh. So to this day they might be working on the gay bomb. Do you think trump puts a stop to that? He doesn't waste per necessarily spending. He's pro gay then. Yeah, but he doesn't want to be too complicated change people. What if a regular guy like him gets bitten by that spider I radioactive gay spider? Do you know about how that tick that turns people into vegans? Count down was a tick bite. This tick bites you and you develop a meat allergy. Oh really? Yep. Well it's called the lone star tick. Whether they, where they live, probably taxes cause it's called the lone star tick actually guesser but I think they're spreading. But it would be ironic if it was in like the meat eating capital of the world and lone star tick making people allergic to red meat that eat the fuck out of some chicken.

Speaker 1:          03:01:13       Now I'll tell you that Jack. And it was engineered by the government. Uh, I just think it's just nature deciding we're tired of their bullshit. Look, it's been recorded as far north as Maine and all the way to central Texas and Oklahoma. Wow. The ticks are found in the dense undergrowth and wooded areas as well as around animal resting areas. You know, I've been thinking about this man because I run in the hills where this ticks. I saw tick like Ari and I did a podcast the other day that we will release on July 18th, which is the day that Ariz Netflix special comes out. But we did a podcast where we went on a hike and I put on a weighted vest and we went through the woods and did the whole thing that I do when I run and I'm a tick landed on Ari and we knocked it off and then we started talking about it and like go on.

Speaker 1:          03:01:56       Like is there a way to stop ticks from coming on you? Is there like an effective, did they have a spray? Like ticks are not like mosquitoes, right? No. Is there an effective tick spray? No. Do you should know? Do you're so smart, but I don't know that ticks and I'm the last month there's Tikrit Pelham. Other is how effective it is though. Hmm. Yeah. Mosquito repellent doesn't always work. I get bit of a fucking works. I can't bullshit. You know what works? Thermacell you're used the thermacell. Oh Man. I don't know if it's bad for you, but it's amazing. I didn't even know that his thermos cells in a, a piece of equipment that people take on hikes and camping and hunting it. Um, it's, there's this chemical that screws into the bottom and then it has an element. You Click it and heats on and it makes it's fine.

Speaker 1:          03:02:44       Mist through this element and this fine mist. It doesn't smell bad to people, but mosquitoes cannot fuck with it. They just, they just vanish like, well, is it, it's not poisonous to let alone the time or I don't know, man. That's a problem. Yeah. I don't want to be saying doing this. And then five years later you got dementia and I heard you. I'm thinking, yeah, I'm panicking now. Shit. Some things I can't remember. So it'd be good for them. Yeah. What about him? I've seen him. Oh No, I definitely have it. But I went looking. Did Ya? Yeah, I did a whole TV show about it. Yeah. Did you? Yeah. Well, I did this, a show that I used to do on the Scifi channel that made me, this is get made a lot of people mad at me and it also made me realize what conspiracy theories really we're all about. And the show's called Joe Rogan questions, everything. So it would go and I would embed myself with these people and hang out with them and I embedded myself with these big foot people. And what I said at the end of it was, here's one thing that you don't find when you go looking for bigfoot black people, you're more likely to find big foot than you are black people looking for bigfoot. It's a bunch of unfuckable white guys out camping.

Speaker 1:          03:03:56       It's true black people to want to have nothing to do with it. It's a goofy white obsession and it's also, um, there's no one that I talked to her. This is like one lady that had a pretty good story. She believed that she was saying, but here's the thing, black bears are huge and they, the, you know, you can get a black beard seven feet tall easily and they walk on their hind legs. Sometimes they just do, everybody knows they do. There's video of them. It's not a mystery. Black bears walking through the woods on hind legs are seven feet tall. You would think that's big for us. It's really just telling him our shops like that. I mean there's, if there's no big foot, but the earth is flat, we'll do, I believe, well, I don't think the earth is flat either. I think it's just everything's aligned, man.

Speaker 1:          03:04:35       This is all psy ops thing. It's, there are so many, like really convincing stories. That's the thing. The third one, sorry, I haven't heard one of them. Well, convincing stories of big foot. No. Oh, I've had loads. Whether like, you know, I was, I was like, you know, five feet away from this. Like, you know, he's saying and it didn't have like, you know, he didn't have the best price and a man's face and they'll, they'll be like, you know, and it was, it was looking at me and stuff with this. Is that okay? But nobody's ever gold. Good picture of any of these things, you know? Yeah. Nobody really goes to the woods on a regular other than Les Stroud Survivor. Man. He believes that you thinks one, but there, there are never any bodies. There's never any feces. I've heard bears makeup fucking monkey noise too.

Speaker 1:          03:05:12       I heard him say that. He's like, it made it sound. He's like, there's clearly a primate sound, but I've heard, I've seen in my own eyes in the woods a bear do that with another bear. Yeah. They make that when they fight with each other. Yeah. It must be bad as it must be like hopping percents. Cause I mean you can't have like, you can't have like a species of Australia pithy kiss or whatever it, it's supposed to be gigantic. Sorry. Yeah. Drag it into piff kiss whatever is supposed to be. And just like [inaudible] is America's a huge place. You would find, you would find something, you find a dead one or something after a while. There's enough people looking. But the thing is when they found out that like that about that Hobbit Guy, do you know the hollow Homo Floresiensis for instances? For instance, I know the thing you talking about, it was in the island of Flores.

Speaker 1:          03:06:01       Yeah. And Indonesia they found within the last 14,000 years there was absolutely a little person that was like two and a half, three feet tall look like, uh, yeah. But they look 100% human. Oh, this thing is did not look 100% human. It was a new car. It was another type or an offshoot of Homo sapiens. Yeah, I mean, I don't know if they classified it. I don't know if they have DNA on it. It's, it's, it's a relation of hume that yes, it's a type of human, but it's not neanderthal tall and it's not homosapien. And this thing was 14,000 years ago. So they know that gigantic [inaudible] was a real animal in the net. It lived on hundred per 100% alongside human beings as recently as 100,000 years ago. But this, uh, this is just nonsense. I was big for thing. Well, that Orang pen deck is much more interesting.

Speaker 1:          03:06:52       The orange pen deck is a small Hobbit, like man that lived, uh, I think that might've been Indonesia as well. Right. But what is the Vietnam? Vietnam, well, I think it's these, some of these tropical jungle climates where there might have been as recently as, you know, a hundred years ago or whatever, that might have been a few of those fuckers remaining. They don't know. I mean when someone dies in the woods, man, do you know how many people we lose in the United States? Loads thousands. Every year. Thousands. I watched David polite all the time on like art bell and stuff. I think he's great and he's, I, I love that. He's like such clean coal American guy and he never goes into like the wild conspiracy theory angle to it. But it's, it's, it's always hinting that, uh, it's probably painful. So Santiago, well that was a book, a movie wrapped.

Speaker 1:          03:07:38       Never is. It's like Bobcat Goldthwait made a movie about big foot eating people. Oh Wow. It's a great move. They're fine. It's called Willow Creek. It's a horror movie. And you liked bobcat bolt golf. Wade made a horror movie dude. He made a great horror movie. It's like a sort of like one of those Blair witch project type movies about a couple that go up looking for bigfoot, you know, and just a film like where are they? Original Patterson footage was taken place. It's a person in a suit. People love, they want to believe that person that fucking say bobcat ones bleed. But why? But why did they put tits on the seat? Because it's a girl get up. Why would they make terrible anybody who looks at it, it looks like a person. A suit as well. Another part of my bit, I said, whenever you see something that looks like a person in a suit, it's a person in a suit.

Speaker 1:          03:08:24       There's not a fucking animal. A lot lose a person in a suit. Yeah. I just, I just wanna know the conversation was, I look if we, if we get mail, so it means he's going to look like person to suit, but if we get a female so they can be like, why would they, why would they put tits on it? Well, he was can a real big, they did a female because the female would be smaller than male. So instead of it being an eight foot tall thing, you get a six foot tall thing and it's like a regular size dude with some nice tits and you're like, it's chick bro. Meanwhile, it's a big guy, like a big seven foot. I mean, I love the big food. Like I live the breakdown videos will live youtube the grade and it's always like done. Let's do it in a suit.

Speaker 1:          03:09:01       It was a Wiki leaks that was just released today about NASA knowing about aliens. Railey yes. Pull it up. Jamie. NASA knows about aliens. They have information on Wiki leaks, knows if they're going to spill the beans. I tell you when it comes out somewhere so that it really is true. And then there's like an alien ambassador on the White House lawn or something. You gotta be like, Oh, okay. I was in a unit like a prowling. Oh, it's anonymous. I thought it was much more likely to be pranksters. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Much more likely. That's anonymous. A global hacking collected the leads that alien life exists and thanks. NASA is about to confirm it. The shadowy group. Oh yeah. I love that. It's a shadowy group of artists and you can be in, you could join. Oh, I have, you know, I'm not, I mean I'm in to exactly.

Speaker 1:          03:09:52       Uh, in a 12 and a half minute video publishing an unofficial youtube channel on Tuesday, the video centers around recent findings by the American space organization, including the discovery of 219 new planet candidates, 10 of which present similar conditions to Earth by NASA's Kepler space telescope team in June, as well as comments made by a senior NASA official. But here's the real thing, right? You believe in, I believe as well that it's entirely possible that some life exists somewhere in the infinite universe. Can't believe it doesn't. Of course. I mean we're on the same page. Why are we so skeptical about skeptical about it visiting us? Because it's very difficult to visit us, right? But if it's like way more advanced than us, shouldn't it be able to figure it out? Just like we could figure out how to get a probe to Jupiter, but why can't it figure out how to visit?

Speaker 1:          03:10:39       But then we've got a government conspiracy and cover. Do we or are they just people and they don't know any more than you are? I like, we don't know shit. Why would the, what if aliens came here? Do you think they would like go, oh that's an elected official. Clearly that guy's the mayor. Let me talk to him. No, they'd look at this fucking ant hill and they'd be like, which one of these dip should we tell? I Dunno it just pick that guy up. Just stick some stuff up his ass and do some run some tests on him. That's bullocks though cause we, and listen to it. I've gotten really offended and we've got a friends online forever and this is just a call the counselor. I'll give it to this. We can, we can distinguish between from one end to another. Yeah, we can see the workers, we can see the soldiers, we can see the queen. They can, they can tell. They would surely be smart. But does the queen or physically shaped different?

Speaker 8:          03:11:24       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          03:11:25       They're different things. Like this big one makes all the babies. It's pretty obvious that a queen bee, she's, she has a giant Stinger that doesn't detach and she goes and kills all the baby bees, which is trying to kill the women. They speak English. They probably can, but if they say Mr President, we have to think that if something is alien that it could be so alien that all of our concepts of culture are so bizarre that there's no context for it to relate to send a language. They've just know what we're saying. They know what we're saying based on the fact that it's fairly simple. If they can understand the language then they must have real relatable or similar concepts in their own board. Not necessarily. It'd be able to translate, not necessarily then the continents language. That's not necessarily true. That's putting them into a limitation that we currently have. Like we don't understand dolphin language, but we know they have a language we can, we can appreciate the dolphins probably have a concept for eating. Right? Right. So like if, if the dolphins, I didn't, I didn't know what dolphin temperature in terms of like who's the queen, who's the mayor hierarchical, you know, they don't have like an Alpha Dolphin and people, the dolphins will have some like clicks that mean the person in charge. I mean they must have some concept of hierarchy because they have a concept for see them operate under. Right. But you know, if we could don't really understand dolphin language will know. But I mean we can surely pick out like the

Speaker 2:          03:12:52       concepts themselves. I mean they must be the concept of the Leda. I though they just count on send the concept of labor. I don't think it is widely understood what dolphins are saying. I think it's, when I translate dolphin to humans, we can't even recreate it. No, no, I'm sure what I mean, we can't recreate their, sounds like we don't know what their sounds mean. Like if we set a bunch of shit to a dolphin, I'm not saying we can talk to dolphins or anything, but like, like with a, with a dog, you know, you can, they, the dogs would go sit in kinds of very, very primitive methods of communication. But like a dog whimpers you know, it's in pain, right? You know it. And so I have to have a concept of being, uh, being in pain to understand the dog's going. I know that that means the dog hurt.

Speaker 2:          03:13:37       I must understand that the concept of hurts. Right. And so if the aliens, if they can end standing diced and they must understand the concept of what president is or they must have, they must have some sort of, they must have a clean way of analyzing it. Surely they for sure, if they can take taking all [inaudible] superior to us. I'll be saying, well if not superior technologically far more advanced in in that there've been alive longer. But when you consider the possibility of all sorts of different weather conditions, different life conditions, maybe different solar systems where they have zero concern about being hit by an asteroid is bipedal. Yeah. And it's like, fine. Well that's because they're supposed to represent us in the future cause easier. Is that what it is? Surely. Because we were called the funny too. I think it's a relatable thing.

Speaker 2:          03:14:23       It'd be that too, but that was my point is that I think that aliens could potentially be so alien that they can't even relate to the concept of our ability to communicate with noises. Like they might be. Emily, Katie Fair with smells. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. They might be using some telekinesis or some shit. Psychics, man. Yeah, maybe. I mean, so he's, do you think if you had a bet all of your youtube money very much. I have aliens. Have aliens been here or no? I probably been no, no. Yeah, but skeptic, I mean all of the ancient alien stuff. It's total horse shit. Yes. Total Horse Shit. That stuff is really fits more time. Graham Hancock, Randall Carlson mode of there being an ancient, very advanced civilization that probably was wiped out. Just like we know there have been civilizations that were wiped out. It's much more likely that someone like say in Machu Picchu, someone was able to construct things, you know, that were like really confusing cause today, yeah, it wouldn't come from the new world. Um, it's really interesting because as soon as you start going down this line you think, okay, well do you need to have high civilization? You need sudden series of things and there are a bunch of books you can it to. Abundance of food, agriculture. It's like you need a little more than that as well. But like he's, you can, you can

Speaker 3:          03:15:49       read a ton of solar things, wealth, power or poverty in politics, come up with the title is, um, and uh, why nations fail and, uh, what's the guns, germs and steel red and we these books. And then suddenly you understand what, what populations need three quarters of it. I should be honest, it's really good. I bailed on it, but it, you know, there's a whole slew of things you need as a civilization for humans to develop to high sort of standards, population density and all this sort of thing. And so, um, but it's not just population densities, lots of other places that have high population densities. So in Africa for example, you've got very few areas that have high population density. And so you don't have great civilizations like in sort of sub Saharan Africa because there just aren't great cities, dense cities to trade with. And then, and then you go, okay, well what they had, it's difficult tree cause in Africa and this is something that Thomas soul goes into is a look the rivers a Humphrey navigable, you know, they've got lots of rapids and some rocks and not very deep.

Speaker 3:          03:16:49       You can't carry huge barges done. They're not like, they're not like the Danube. You know this thing goes for, you know, hundreds of miles and his deep and you can get barges all up and down it and stuff like this. I mean, and traveling, traveling goods by water is so much more fashion, like you know, like 20 times more efficient than trying to take them over the land. And so if you don't have, especially in three large machines and so you'd need that innovation or to create the large machines in the first place. Exactly. And, and you need somewhere to take it. You're not trading with anyone. If there's, if you're the one like Atlantean civilization, no one else is buying your gifts. Like it's, it's, it's all horse shit. It just couldn't happen based on what you need for this thing to actually end up exist.

Speaker 1:          03:17:32       Right. In order for an Atlanta is to exist, you really have to have a bunch of Atlanta lenses. Yeah. Which is more likely that there were some sophisticated civilizations that were hit by asteroids. Well, not have evidence for that. It's a lot of iridium. Yeah. There's a lot of actual physical evidence. Yeah. There's also the stuff, it's kind of clear glass. Well it's the best evidence cause iridium comes from space. Iridium radium, when you find it in large quantities indicates and asteroid impact. Um, iridium is very common in space and extremely rare on earth. So when there's a whole sediment layer of iridium, it's almost entirely provable. That's when it was hit by something, wouldn't it be some sort of ruins underneath thisone yeah. They're found a lot of ruins. And this is what I was really fascinating about how old go Beckley tapis 12,000 plus years old.

Speaker 1:          03:18:18       Yeah. But that didn't get, that didn't die because it was hit by an asteroid. Well they, this is what Graham Hancock and Randall commensalism. It's speculating. That was really primitive. Okay. You don't know that. But before we go into a massive, huge stone columns that are 92 feet tall, they're carved out of stone by people that are hunters and gatherers. It's pretty impressive. But the point being you're hero Tiramisu for this, you know, for the thing, but it's not like a technological achievement. Well, okay, what is a PR impressive? Machu Picchu? Impressive. It's pretty impressive, right? That's not ulta. Well, it's thousands. A couple thousand years old. It's 100 1400 something. Okay. I don't think that's true. And I don't think they know that for a fact. And this is one of the speculations that Graham Hancock and Randall Cros that have presented is that the evidence of this nuclear glass, which only exists on impact sites before you go to your phone, listen to maybe so you can understand what I'm saying, impact sites, um, where meteors hit or where they've done nuclear tests.

Speaker 1:          03:19:13       So they found this stuff and micro diamonds, evidence of massive impacts. But when they do core samples, they founded at 10 and 12,000 years, which is essentially the same time period as the end of the ice age did a huge podcast on it with geologists. They don't know though. Here's the thing, when you talk to an expert, this is pure speculation. There's no carbon dated evidence that points to that age where as there is with the Sphinx. So with the Sphinx, or excuse me with the Great Pyramids, the Great Pyramid of Giza, they've done some tests on some of the sediment and some of the stuff in between the stones and they brought it to about 2,500 BC. Crazy specifically. Yeah. They found a bunch of stuff that shows without, with a very high, uh, high degree of possibility or probability that it's around 2,500 BC. Yeah. What they've done with this [inaudible] name of the massive impacts.

Speaker 1:          03:20:05       Well, there's, yeah. With Geezer, right? Yeah. But there's a, with, um, rather, uh, the great pyramid, but there's, there's plenty of evidence that there was some sort of a massive event around 10,000 and 12,000 years ago. And what their belief is that this is where all the stories of Atlanta has come from. This is where all these stories of these great civilizations that were wiped out come from is that most likely we experienced a big die off and a lot of people were affected by these disasters and catastrophes. That coincided with asteroidal impacts. Maybe. But I mean we know where the stories of Atlantis come from Plato. Right? But, and he had gone to Egypt and, and been told us, but it's all, I mean it's not looking real thing. It's not, I mean he, he said yeah 9,000 years before the present and that they built the thing then he was, that's what's crazy is that this is Alex.

Speaker 1:          03:20:56       But it does coincide with the time of the impact. For example, 9,000 years ago there wasn't an Egypt, you know, from Plato Plato's, you know, from like 2,500 years ago, from now, like 500 BC, like 9,000 years pulled out that will's new Egypt. There was no efforts. And yet the story involves, that's not necessarily true either. Robert Schoch cause the geologists that have a Boston University has done a lot of um, investigation on the, the, the temple that the Sphinx was carved out of, like where the, the Sphinx is the walls of the temple and he believes it's from water erosion. There's this, these fissures and he's deep, uh, erosion marks that they believe indicate that the temple of Sphinx or the area that's carved out of is far older than the same. Like they know that the Great Pyramid of Giza is two, 500 BC,

Speaker 2:          03:21:46       but they fail, always attribute the Sphinx of being the same timeline. Dr Robert Schoch from Boston University, he says, that's not the case. He said, what you're looking at is thousands of years of rainfall and they have hundreds of geologists that have signed off on this. This is not like, and there's, he goes over the physical evidence of these fissures and how they're made. He's like, as a geologist, I can tell you, you are looking at thousands of years a rainfall. The last time there was series rainfall in the Nile Valley was about 7,000 BC. So what he's saying is it's entirely possible that there have been many different civilizations that lived in this area and that Egypt is a civilization that might have gone back many, many thousands of years longer than just the construction of the Great Pyramid of Giza. Uh, I wasn't talking about the Great Pyramid of Giza really, but that's Egypt will live us just a monument in Egypt.

Speaker 2:          03:22:35       Right. But Egypt is a place that did exist 10,000 years ago. 12,000 years ago. 50,000 years. Because I like cars, but don't say it. No it didn't. Cause you don't really know well, but you're saying no it didn't. I'll tell you, are you in Egyptologist do you you had boots on the ground and talk to the people over there? We don't really know. Right. Well he doesn't know what I'm about say, but you said no it didn't. Well yeah, but the, the state of Egypt. Okay. Okay. Like as I'm not saying they weren't people living in the area. There aren't, daddy would've been people living in the area. Right. But calling it Egypt are saying, yeah, they wouldn't know co when did they start calling it Egypt. Oh, I'd have to look that up. Put it in there. But um, the like we can tell I'll kill, just can tell like, um, like when the, when of grains with first domesticated and things like this and you're never going to have a state without farming, you're never going to happen.

Speaker 2:          03:23:23       You're not going to have like a hunter gatherer, a state where they have a government and you need a surplus of food to be able to support, um, uh, pre uh, preached the cloths in the US a bureaucratic class. Right, right. And to get something built, you need these things. Right. Which I mean, not necessarily calling off stone. Like if you're going to build a pyramid, yes, you need these things. Maybe calling us thinks that's something tribesmen could do. It ain't even cold cocked bell tappy out of it's pronounced go back clean. Yeah. Correctly. Uh, that, that can easily believe that like, you know, nomadic a hunter gatherers, they could, they could have crossed the that cause you just, just basically sanding and chipping. It's done. Well. They've moved them to it. These are huge chunks of stone that were done back when they didn't have a surplus of resources.

Speaker 2:          03:24:06       The hunters and gatherers and you've done it wrong. I'm not saying it wasn't like a monumental achievement for the time and the resources obviously was, but we know that they weren't farming well. It might be right about that, but we might not be right. You're talking about an incredibly long time ago. 12,000 years ago is a long time and whatever evidence would be left is really probably been absorbed by the earth by though. Oh, maybe. But I mean we can't sit here and speculate about something that might've happened if we've gotten a weapon. But that's exactly what we're doing. If we're saying that they were definitely hunter and gatherers, we don't know assumption, but we do know is they were capable of making these incredibly massive, complicated structures 12,000 years ago for sure is the Sphinx. And infant. We mess up. We're now talking about that.

Speaker 2:          03:24:52       We're talking about gold Beckley tappy but yeah, they had the space isn't big. It's fucking huge and for you to say that it's very disturbing because they've only uncovered 5% of it or 10% it's massive for further than comparable. Not Quite big studies, but this is the problem. You don't know a lot about it, but you're automatically jumping to this skeptical but you haven't. If you didn't think it was big. I just can't remember off the top of my head exact the problem. But you're so convinced in your argument, but you're not really ever really spent a whole lot of time thinking about a carving stone man that's not very advanced. Just carving stone. They're carving stern with three dimensional objects in the stone, meaning like lizards that are on the outside of it. 19 foot hauls, tall stone columns and concentric circles. Is this, is there a huge structure, look at the hiring, any particular the technology today it does to move those things?

Speaker 2:          03:25:42       Look, we'll look at the image on the far right. That's what they have figured out so far. By using radar underground, we look at the size of this room. That is huge. It's fucking shiny, primitive. It's just stone. It's not that primitive for someone to make something out of stone that Dave, it's really impressive. Right? It must've been primitive and turn, but like they don't have a TV. Is that what you mean? It isn't like the like for example, I'm sure if they, I'm sure if they went and did some sort of like super high resolution scans on it or something like that, they'd be like, right, okay. This has been coughed with other stone tools. You know, they can tell these be called Capa tools, whatever. This wouldn't have been carved by a couple of tools. You know, he knows. He don't even know that when it comes to the great pyramid.

Speaker 2:          03:26:23       In fact, there's a lot of people that speculate, they figured out a way to make some sort of a diamond tipped late drill in order to make the, uh, the king's chamber. And some of the sarcophagus is if they look at us not fringe, they don't really know how they carved out some of the stone in the, there's, there's a simple thought, two pages. There's a simple vase in Egypt they don't understand because it's carved completely at a one piece of stone, but it's so intricate and so hard that they've made this incredibly thin lip on this vase and they've gone deep inside of it and the whole thing is entirely smooth. They really don't know how the fuck they did it. Probably some paper. I'm rubbing it patients, they can't get your fingers inside of this thing. I'm talking about an actual vas. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          03:27:01       It's very, very confusing to modern archeologists. This is not a got engine. Anyway, I don't know about that. I was talking about what I'm saying. What is an ancient advanced civilization like? Don't you agree that the Parthenon, the Acropolis, that's an advanced civilization? Not particularly for the time for what they, for what they accomplished is amazing. They said none of great massive stones that are cut in place. The beautiful columns, fifth century. Okay. Well then what pays in advance civilization if that's not advance? That's the point, isn't it? Can you talk calling your vans pathogen to as a, the glorification of athletes over its empire, right, right. It was not that these things didn't already exist. It's he wanted to make Athens look special in the eyes of the rest of the world. This is what I'm confused. Like what year did this happen and when do you consider people to be fans of out on the full 60 be seals?

Speaker 2:          03:27:53       I should know that. Advanced civilization. No. Come on, man. If that didn't exist anywhere and then all of a sudden may send 1000 years ago, then yeah, but if 10,000 years ago, something like something like, uh, the Parthenon and the Acropolis, if we could prove that 10,000 years before anybody had done anything else that that existed, you'd be blown away by that, right? Yeah, but shocking. Yeah. No, the, the [inaudible] may be 10,000 BC. That would be incredible. Right? Right. It would be right. But a bunch of upright stones that have been nicely carved to have animals on them and stuff like that, that just that massive stones in 19 feet tall and concentric circles all in this huge structure hens in Britain. We know how they made it and we know where the students came from. You know, having gotten the, you're one of those dudes, well you're one of those dudes that history that, no, not just read history cause you don't know anything about go back.

Speaker 2:          03:28:44       They tempe and yet you're so, so you just your throat to me. But I'm trying to tell you what, Oh I interrupt you. You're adorable. You keep going with these things. You really don't even know anything about this area and yet your money by hunters and gatherers, there's a lot of argument one way or the other about it. It's entirely possible that they had discovered farming. I guess. I mean that, that's the area that farming was a originally, originally as part of the problem, right? When you get to 12,000 years ago, who knows what the fuck isn't it? And we think they knew things and then we find out that they knew more. I mean this is mostly covered in ice. How could you get an advanced civilization? Heart of the earth? Yeah. Yes. Mostly covered in Nice, like when you're dealing with North America, right?

Speaker 2:          03:29:28       North America 12,000 hours ago. Big parts of it. But on the south to felt like a band in the middle of this. Yeah. I mean we're was posted. What do they think Turkey was like back then? Because this is where it go. Beckley cafes in Turkey, what they think Turkey was like 12,000 years ago. And the problem is if that, if they can carbon date it absolutely to 12,000 years ago, they know it was covered up. It was intentionally covered 12,000 years ago. This is the story of, go back to Cathy. Um, when was it constructed that they don't know because stone you can't carbon date, like the way they did it with the Egyptian pyramids, they got the material in between each stone. So I can kind of think they know, you know, like say 30,000 years ago, 20,000 years ago, I could, I could believe in a certain area of the world, the, a bunch of tribesmen who hunter gathering maybe, maybe seasonally nomadic, um, you know, for a hundred years, you know, maybe it was a, you know, as a religious duty. They considered it to be, I mean, this thing, stonehenge was built over a period of like, look thousand years. I mean, it took a long time to just put these fucking stones. So, I mean, we don't know how long this would have taken, but to have a bunch of carved stones up, right. Even if they're big, they'll just requires more people that that's not great technological

Speaker 3:          03:30:40       feat. That's the thing. It's not a blood is a technological feat. If Marlene, the Acropolis, there's not a technological feat. It was a technological feat, but it wasn't particularly unique to the world at the time. In fact, the Persians in the Babylonians and Syrians, they've been done of thousands years before that. The Greeks were catching up when the, doesn't that then support the idea that go Beckley Tapi is even more unique because it was incredible as a name. No, no. That's all right. It's that is an advanced civilization then. Well, no. Well, yeah. I mean it's advanced for the rest of the world, but it's, it's pretty advanced for today. If we wanted to build something like that today would take massive resources. It would take huge machines. It would take a gigantic group of engineers. That's how convenient project. That's out of convenience. What do you mean out of convenience?

Speaker 3:          03:31:24       Why that's missing that? How was it out of convenience when you get 19 foot tall stones that are, because you don't really get loads in there. He pulls him in a circle. I mean, it's a lot of work. Of course it is. Yeah. That's why would you use machines? Because it'd just be a lot of work. It's not as simple as you just use machines, like you'd have to get very specific massive machines that are incredibly difficult to engineerings and these people did that without any of that shit. Yeah, they did the ropes and pretty easily logs, prob probably prominent police actually, but the ropes in logs, who knows how the fuck they did it, but that's what we're supposed to be. There was no wheel back then. They'll probably wasn't, I mean it's pretty spectacular. Yeah, yeah. No, no, it's okay. Yeah. Right. Okay.

Speaker 3:          03:32:03       So let me, so I'm not trying to take away the amount of effort involved in building this thing and the willpower to do it and the manpower to do it. What are you trying to say and not indicative of an advanced civilization? What, when I think, I think he's a definition of advanced. For example, like I would consider an advanced civilization have writing. I would consider them to have metallurgy. I would consider, I wouldn't even call this advanced this, I mean this is, this is, this puts them, this puts them where we were 4,000 years ago, you know, as a species. So advanced is like, uh, it's all, it's all well, yeah. Well, I mean it's all relative, isn't it? So it's like, I mean what I mean, yeah, I mean if, if, if, if you want to speculate, they might have been a civilization like pre ice age or during the ice age that had writing and metallurgy and you know, great cities and international trade agriculture also all this sort of stuff that we would look, if you look at the Roman Empire, we see if we take them as the model of an advanced civilization.

Speaker 3:          03:33:02       Right. And when I say advanced, we mean not as advanced as we are now. [inaudible] right. Well that's what everyone speculates about. Atlanta says, well no one ever thinks that Atlanta was like today. They think some crazy things. Some people really, some people, I mean, yeah, but um, yeah, this is, we should should've been more specific. Um, but yeah, I mean, don't, don't get me wrong. I'm sure that for the time, like when a run around and tribe came over the hill and they saw go back to the teepee and it was incredible, it was like, ah, the gods have built this, you know, that's what they would have thought. I'm sure you know, to them it would have relatively been incredible, you know, am I'm doing wrong?

Speaker 1:          03:33:38       I know I don't want to take away the achievement for the people who made it cause it's unbelievably good. And you know, especially for the time, but like if, if they didn't have white mel tools then have writing, they didn't have agriculture, I wouldn't call that advance. I'd just call that a loss of work for a premise of civilization. And the same with this stone henge would have been the real problem is we don't really know what they had. And until more evidence gets uncovered, they, they're just guessing. They have some carbon dating. They know that the stones exist. They don't even know. I mean they didn't even know about this until 1990 something. I mean they found it in the 90s but me know all of northern Europe, you know, stone circles hinges me or whatever. Well they find more of those now than ever before with satellites.

Speaker 1:          03:34:17       Right? Yeah. Seen the ones that they're finding now in the Amazon and they're like, what the fuck is this? They're finding all these structures, the channels, and you send me the link to that because that sounds interesting. Well that's the lost city of z. You know about that right now there's a, there was a guy who went looking, he was an explorer, went looking for the loss series, city of z in the Amazon. It was like a mythical lost city and he got eaten by cannibals. Apparently there's some movie that's coming out about him right now that's racist. No, they were white counts. I'm about that. Um, but I'll post privilege. It was, um, yeah, it was speculated that before the Ama, well that's the other thing that came out recently. The Amazon was covered in the ocean somewhere around 10 million years ago or something.

Speaker 1:          03:34:59       But they think that these people had some sort of, you know, for the time again, what is an advanced civilization? Yeah. It probably needs to be defined. Yeah. I think that that's the first step. But yeah, I mean it's interesting to say love isn't the path for them to invest saying, no, not really. You know, it, it was a beautiful thing. It a great construct. And it costs the Athenians a lot of money and they did it to beautify the city and make it the jewel of Greece. Um, but it wasn't like, I mean, what's more impressive is it's more that they did for political reasons. The Parthenon is built on the crop. They did it. The Acropolis is what's a really a trip. What it was cause this giant fucking chunks of stone. They have no idea how big they are open. They're huge and they're like, what?

Speaker 1:          03:35:40       They don't even know why they're there, but they weren't even built at the same time. The Acropolis is just a natural stone formation. Not necessarily there's stones under that natural stone, like the, the actual platform that the parthenon was built on existed before the Parthenon. Right. I, I'm not sure I follow what you're saying that because as far as I'm aware, the Acropolis, the Acropolis just lost the inflammation. Then they, I guess they must have leveled it off as something something, but then there's actual physical stones, actual monstrous physical stones that are involved in construction molter and see the same sort of pull up photos, see if he could find that. There's a bunch of that. Yeah. The old ones. And what's the thing in Multa where they thought there was like bill by side collapses or something? Giant. Giant size, like 3000 years BC. Is that ball back now? That's in Lebanon? Yeah. No, this ball back in Lebanon, they found these enormous stone carved things. Yeah. See those stones? Which ones? The uh, the, the, there's, there's some stuff. See if you could find some images of the,

Speaker 2:          03:36:36       yeah, some of it does. It does. From that side. I'm pretty sure that just a natural stone out. I mean the, on the, this sort of like fortifications around it, you know, you can probably just google that and find out when we put up it probably like 16th century or something, you know, there's nothing mystical about the path or not. It's just a really useful defensive fortification or not missed a call. I'm just saying ancient. I think they, uh, the speculation was that the, uh, the Acropolis, which one's the Acropolis? That's bottom. The Parthenon is the top. Now the powerful though is on the Acropolis. The Parthenon is on the top and the Acropolis is on the bottom. That's what I'm saying. That they, the, the thing that they think is the ancient stones. Okay. Altogether. Yeah. And the Parthenon is just the building. Yeah. Right. Okay. The papillon was a temple. And so when you say the Acropolis, the Parthenon is the, most cities have necropolis, which is just a raised rocky bit that they'd build defensive right then. But you know, they'd put the temple's on and stuff like, so find out what, where, where I read that, see if you could google a man made stones in the Acropolis. There was some sort of weird speculation that the Acropolis was a part of some structure that was far older than the Parthenon.

Speaker 2:          03:37:42       Not, uh, not, not persuaded by all of that sort of, that was a bit fringe stuff for me. You're not in the friendship. Not when it comes to history. I like to know accurate stuff, you know? Yeah. No, it makes sense. It's just fringe is always more attractive though. It's interesting, isn't it? Because you never know and there's the like, oh, you might be able to find out for yourself, but it's also like undeniably it has gravity. Yeah. Towards me. At least I am. I love the old stuff. They're like, no, no, no. You know what they found out, man, they were werewolves. You know, there's always like something that you find out. Yeah. I went through all of this and my twenties I went through literally all of these fucking, I'm a late bloomer. They really, all right. You'll end up eventually where I am.

Speaker 2:          03:38:21       Oh, I definitely want wake end up where you are. You will, you know, it's, it's a good place to be. It's um, you go through all of these ferries and you'll immediately dismiss things. No, you don't immediately dismiss things. Then you have to start reading about why things happened. That's the thing. You have to start reading the, the source material. That's why I know who built the bill, the Parthenon. Right. But that's also why you just just flippantly decided that [inaudible] was small. Yeah. Well, no, no, it's not that the size of, it's irrelevant. It's the sort of technological advancement, you know, it doesn't take much to Co coff stone. They used to, you know, let you know they just other stone to break against it and then it's smooth at the hands of sand. You know, it just took a lot of work for a long time and I mean wrong, it must've been fucking with, you know, get a hide the leather put sand in it.

Speaker 2:          03:39:02       He spent ages smoothing up stone. Do it yourself if you'd like. It's fucking boring, you know? But I guess if you've got nothing else to do all day because you're just right here, Jamie, but that's not carved, that's like, uh, this is bass relief I believe is it says what most of the art, and we'll go back with tippy was it was like, ah, yeah, it's a three d and moved away and not carved into, yeah, that's what was interesting about. It's more difficult. Yeah. It doesn't really, I mean, I don't want to take anything away from the artist because that must've been a lot of work. What was the a man made stones and the Acropolis to finding

Speaker 1:          03:39:34       there was evidence of these enormous chunks of rock that were moved. Maybe I might be conflating chunks of rock a ball back in Lebanon with the Acropolis. It's all fascinating to me because we don't know. We just don't know what these people were up to and we see what they left behind and we pieced it together and people have studied it for thousands of years and it's just, it's amazing. Just, I mean, I'm sure you've been to Rome, right? You haven't, it's on my list to me, man. The coliseums fairly recent, right? One of the century ideal something. Yeah. I mean in terms of like ancient civilization, the very recent, but it's, it's so crazy when they show you the history of it. How they used to that whole thing was like Nero's backyard. I mean that's really what, and then they decided to, once they, it's a bad, yeah. Well then then decided to build this, this thing to sort of entertain the masses. And this thing has gone through all these different, various stages. And when they show you all the different things they used to do, they're like, have these boat fights where they would fill it up with water and they would raise these lions and all these animals through the bottom of the cage and they would fight against him. Like you're fucking crazy. And not that long ago.

Speaker 1:          03:40:49       Yeah. I mean like, people used to be brutal. Let's think people forget. It's like, well, we were talking about Isis. They still are. Yeah, well they, uh, but now, I mean not that shocks and his whole unit to most people, but like, I mean, like in, in the 15th century, 16th century kids used to do coke fighting. You know, they, they do it here in Mexican and Mexican neighborhoods. Yeah. I can just watching these chickens killing one of my old dumb, this guy that he's to use as a gardener, like six, seven years ago, he used to cockfight no, no something, no compassion for anything that wasn't human. Basically. It was like, oh, definitely not for chickens. Yeah. They put razor blades on them. Live with spurs on them. They fight each other. Yeah. It's fucking crazy. Yeah. They, I went to this guys, you already had like a hundred a roosters in these like pens and they would have this carved out area and a pit it let the roosters go.

Speaker 1:          03:41:37       It's super common. It's super common in many parts of the world. In fact, it's really common in the south of America, not South America, but south of the United States. It's a, it's real common, like cockfights sort of not thought of the same way. It's like dog fights, like dog fights. Horrify people. Yeah, but chicken fights. People like, Hey, he's cutting the dog. Well, it's still, they still do bull fights in Spain. Should I do all the amazing, it's pretty controversial these days. They just lost another matador a couple of days ago. He got fucked. Doug. I stepped over his own cape. Tripped over the Cape. Got Jacked. Yeah. Yeah. He'd get torn apart. No sympathy whatsoever. No, no. It's a foolish way to do. You wanted it to die and risk your life. The whole thing is crazy ex. But Spain is an advanced civilization. Well, I've known too many Spaniards.

Speaker 3:          03:42:31       Ah, how dare you. But didn't anything that I think in general there are modern Western civilization and they have bull fighting. Do you know what's really funny about spine? Explain that. Cause I mean like a, in America you've got a terrible history, right? We have a terrible history of being terrible is what you're saying. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. So the Spanish, Spanish, Spanish history is, I'm highly Islamophobic obviously. And I went out and spent a few years ago and um, everything everywhere. It's a white guy killing him, Muslim on every poultry, on every undergo. Oh yeah. Cause they spent 800 years kicking the Muslims out of Spain because the Muslims came along and conquered Spain. And so everything is Towsley Islamophobic because that is their history. They can't get away from it that they wouldn't be a Spain because the malls came over and conquered it and they were like, right, everyone's a Muslim now or you're going to have to pay the Gza.

Speaker 3:          03:43:21       Ah, you're going to be a DHIMMI. And they were like, no. And they spent emgs, his letter, whatever, loss, resistance or whatever, they're the Spanish. Before it would be like, you know, just the reconquista and it took several crusades. It took hundreds of years and gallons of blood. But eventually Spain became Christine again and the, and the Muslims and they're like the, the Islam of files. He'll sit there and go, oh well you know, I'll under loose. Yeah it was stolen from someone else and these people took it back. I've got no fucking sympathy for these people. Got kicked out. Who came in originally? I wasn't even supposed to be there. And I'll tell you what, the Muslims are fucking lucky that Columbus discovered the new world because the Spanish were basically functional roll up all of North Africa. That was gonna. They were piling to take it all fucking back cause this was all Christian.

Speaker 3:          03:44:05       It really annoys me that people are like, oh no that's Muslim. No it wasn't. And it's because they took it and so if the Spanish is going to take it back, that's just as valid. You don't have an argument against them doing it and it's something that's been established though. We don't want you to take it back to know, Oh yeah, I'm not just saying it now. I'll be suggesting it, but it's still, yeah, it does. I put like, you know when we're, when we're looking back at history through the lens of having a moral judgment about it and they go, oh, the Spanish kicked the Muslims. I've Spain. Yeah, good for them. They have every right to, he can't really have moral judgments about history when people do this full time. I mean like the Crusades, Jimmy Dale, this, there's nothing less than the crew said, shut the fuck up Jimmy.

Speaker 3:          03:44:47       You do not know what you're talking about. Just shutup cenk stopped talking at the Crusades. Oh, unless I tell you what, you're right. Let's call them back. Bring back the crusading armies. It's called a Baldwin Baldwin of Jerusalem. Come on. You're going to have to come home. He'd come on Baldwin. This is wrong. We shouldn't be crusading. Oh well that ended 800 years ago, but done conversation over. I pisses me off, man. They keep bringing up the shit. Absolute Shit. But what about the Crusades? What about the fucking crusades? Where are the crusaders Jank you know, where are the fucking crusaders? Are you talking to Janky Yogurt, Jimmy? Any here? You're talking about Yo? Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. Some people do, but most people don't. Fucking nose. I saw him at vidcon. I'm sure he knows there's, you're talking about and when you say his name, but I'm saying you're saying it too, a large audience that people know just because you don't know peanut.

Speaker 3:          03:45:32       Oh, a lot of people don't, but I do keep though. I do know other people don't find for people. How do we get out of bullfighting to this cultural relativism? Basically? I think it was what it is and what we're talking about. Advanced civilizations. He's sick of the apologists. It's like look like look, things that happened in the past, we didn't have to apologize for, you know, these things just happened. We don't need to do things. Why people should apologize for all the, all the horrible things that we've done. What about to native Americans? Should we apologize to them? I think that if they're prepared to apologize to the people they genocide it. Wow, that's, you're going a little too far. But that doesn't exist anymore. No, you go too far back. That's a problem. Well, who decided once we have done that, we've trespassed on their land.

Speaker 3:          03:46:15       You don't bring up them doing it cause that hour that would be native American. A phobic. It's not our place. Our place. Yeah. See this the whole thing. It's all bollocks. And this whole relativism is pissing me off and he read it really actually makes me angry and none of them will ever listen to the like the counter arguments. It's really annoying. And so it's just like, no. Like, you know, nobody's got any respect for you when you turn around and say portable crusades. That's the, I mean, what a boundary is the dumbest damn thing anyway because you never addressing the point. It's like, yeah, but he didn't even give a context about Islam basically. You know, there's, you know, they, they, they for some reason to think that Christianity is as bad as Islam as a nurse, not, I mean like the Crusades were distinctly and, and I spoke to his story and Tom Holland about this and I was like, look, how did they come to the conclusion that they shouldn't have a crusade?

Speaker 3:          03:47:03       And he was like, well they didn't get it from Christianity and the Orthodox, uh, the Orthodox patriarch in Constantinople was just completely against the idea because there's nothing in the Bible that justifies it in the new testament. You know, Jason, man of peace, he turns her on the cheek, he lets his enemies strike him. So you can't pick up a sword and say I'm going to kill someone for Jesus. It doesn't make sense when people have massive amounts of power. And then, I mean, it went, it's weird with the Aztecs, it goes weird with everybody. It was entirely Tempura. It was about like, you know, concrete and Middle East. But it was also about like making sure that they could get to Jerusalem is like, like an ideological thing. Cause the, the Turks were basically preventing pilgrims from getting to Jerusalem because Muslims don't Jerusalem's for like 400 years and everything was okay because the pilgrims could travel along a pill and trail and you know, people make money doing this, you know, they'd sell things.

Speaker 3:          03:47:49       And then the text came in and were like, hey, we're Muslims and fuck everyone cause with the Turks and that was it. The pilgrims couldn't go to Jerusalem and they'd put the pope, I think it was, it was an innocent, the second urban, the second, I can never remember which one it was, which of the pope was he tell him I said, hey, I could create a spiritual kingdom or empire, an empire of faith on. And he's like, why don't you all rather than fighting each other in Europe, I mean Europeans were not very advanced, but they were very, very warlike and wanting to get to the Middle East. And they did. And the crusade was actually, it means a real thrilling thing to read about. Now what, you know, you see like historical films like all the time, it's always the Roman empire. Which one? Just every historical fucking right.

Speaker 3:          03:48:34       Okay. And it's just someone needs to do a film by the first crusade. Cause the first crusade is one of the most thrilling things you can ever read about. It's just the most, it's insane what these men did, you know, marching. I mean they must like a thousand miles from northern Europe and just the master and just, it's so much stuff. Like the pope first calls a crusade and it goes kind of wrong for him cause everyone's like the page or the emperor in Constantinople, the [inaudible], he says the, uh, the pope, look, do me a favor. I'm getting thrashed by the Turks. I need about 4,000 nights professional soldiers, good fighters so I can beat them back. And the posts like, hey, great idea. Why don't we all go over there and beat up the Tux for Christianity and loads of patents when I call. And that's a good idea.

Speaker 3:          03:49:18       And so like 70,000 peasants led by Peter, the hermit turn up on the, the emperor is dose and he's like, what the fuck is this? You know, why have you sent me the scum of Europe to come and fight the Turks? So he just gets them across into Anatolia and they go on and they just get massacred by the text. Absolutely butchered. And then the crusading armies actually arrive a piece. The home actually manages to survive, but then the Crusades, the army's arrive and the Turks think, well this would be fine. And the emperor is like, Shit, look at all these really. And these guys were totally disrespectful. It gets them across and they ended up smashing the texts and the Turks were just expecting another bunch of passes and they're not expecting what they called the men of iron, which couldn't be broken. And that's why they both fight in Paris, Spain, we fucked out.

Speaker 3:          03:50:00       But it's, it's, you know, this, this is a really interesting thing and no one ever talks about it, but it's the history of human beings as fast as we have learned and how long it's taken us to get to this point. The regressive left, they'll always talk to you like this is like a one sided. Oh, the Kristine's side. Just bullying them out of the blue one day. It's like, no. There was an established order. There were things going on. Those is really detailed political landscape, and you'll get someone to Jimmy Dore Goes, wow, there's nothing worth increase age. Just shut up. Just you don't know you're talking about. Just be quiet. All right fella. I'm glad you got that African angry. I've had that on my capital a long time. Listen, we did an extra hour pass the idea. Oh, I could do, it's two now. This is when your flight, so let's get you another flight. Yeah. And uh, thank you brother. I really appreciate you coming on and thanks to have, it was very fun. It was, it's fine. It's nice that I can a bit some people out who need to be bitched out and they see that there's a, if we get that. All right folks, thank you. So back tomorrow with crystal, AEA, cea.
