Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Heyi everybody, this episode of Joe Rogan experience is brought to you by ting. Uh, we have a winner for the Ting, uh, podcast contest and the winner is Holly Mac 23 and Holly Mac 23. She gets an iPhone five, right? Is that what it is? Yeah. I'm assuming that Holly Mac is a girl. I don't even know if it's girl, whoever. Holly Martin. Let's, let's find out. Let's do a little Google search on Holly. Mark 23, should I probably s she's going to get swarmed by assholes now. Wow. I didn't even think of that. But they wanted you to announce it online. Well, Holly Mac 23 got 19 followers. Soon there will be more. She hot. Um, listen, she's a nice person. That's what's important. Yeah, she's very pretty, but she's got a man in her picture, bud. So back off. Anyway, Holly Mac 23, you win the tin contest. What is Ting?

Speaker 1:          00:00:57       Ting is a no bullshit mobile service company that uses a sprint backbone. What Tim does is they rent time on sprint but then give you cell phone service at a in a in a very reasonable way with no contracts, no early termination fees, no add on coverages and you only pay for what you use. If you use very little, you pay very little and if you use more you don't have to pay some exorbitant rates that you, you know, some fines that you'd get when you go over your data coverage or over your text minutes or any of that nonsense that you get with other cell phone providers. And I think that what they're doing is probably most likely going to be the future for cell phone companies. I think the more companies like ting come around and the more they provide you with excellent service without all the nonsense and bullshit and contracts and all the crap that everybody hates about cell phone coverage.

Speaker 1:          00:01:49       All that stuff is out the window of Tang and they have the latest and greatest android devices. They have the HTC one which is a fantastic phone, and the Samsung Galaxy s well, the galaxy note three which is the one that I have, they have the galaxy s four the galaxy has fives coming out soon. The LG flex point is they have all the latest and greatest android devices and they have it in a way where you don't feel like you're getting ripped off. The whole point of the contest was to go to tank and to find out how much money you would save by using Tang, and 98% of people would save money with Tang. That's pretty crazy. 98% those other 2% I don't know what the fuck they're doing, but it's probably some weird shit and that's why they won't say save any money.

Cue The music. Young Jamie, we're going to talk about some crazy shit.

Speaker 2:          00:04:37       The Joe Rogan experience. Joe Rogan podcast by night all day. My Pal Bud Brotzmann was my neighbor. We've been friends for many years,

Speaker 1:          00:04:50       many a year. More than two decades, right? We've been friends for a long time, 17 years, something like that. Long ass time. A bud every year. Leaves family and friends behind and travels to Mexico to do this fucking crazy race. And every year I talked to his wife, shaking my head, I talked to other people, shaking my head, gone that Bud Brotzmann is a crazy son of a bitch. Like what the fuck is he doing down in Mexico doing jumps and flying over hills while he is brought with him, Rob Maccachren who is apparently the man when it comes to this Baja racing stuff. And uh, I mean I'm fascinated by it. And so, uh, I'm, I'm real excited to get you guys on the podcast and talk about it and I know you've got something upcoming that you're promoting that a, so people can get a chance to check it out.

Speaker 3:          00:05:40       Yeah, we, I started racing, I'm at the TV business, right? So I think you think I'm crazy, but this race as much like Mount Everest to me, you just got to go do it. It starts always starts as a stupid bucket list thing. You got to go do, right? So I did it one year, Rob's and doing it for 25 years. 30 I did it one year, 2005 and I'm like, I've got to go climb Mount Everest. I got to go do this thing. So I did it, um, through a sponsor. Might be if Goodrich and I'm like, oh my God, and this is actually leans back to you. This is mixed martial arts of racing. There's no rules. There's no classes. There are there classes, but there's no rules. You can do anything you want. Um, there's consequences down there. I mean, if you don't train, you don't pay attention.

Speaker 3:          00:06:22       You don't sleep. You'd go out and party the night before you have consequences. You get hurt, you get killed. You could wreck your car, you could sit in the middle of the desert for 20 hours. You know, I just went to go compete, Kinda like an iron man. Like I want to go compete. I want to finish it all right. Right. Just say you did a marathon. Yeah, I did a marathon. I'm a be, I get a little trophy, it's fine. And now I'm hooked. Right? So then it's kind of the Lord, this majestic place. Rob will talk about a lot of this majestic place. So I was like, I finished, I'm happy 36 hours in the car. I finished. It was great. Everybody was happy. I was tired of Shit. Then the next year I came back and I want to do it again. Well, maybe I'll take second or third or get on the podium.

Speaker 3:          00:06:57       And then, so I started chasing it and started chasing and it took me eight years every day, you know, I work out all the time just to go race. I watched race videos. I give as much seat time as I can because I only do the one race a year. I do about two races a year, just one the practice, and then I go down and raise the thousand and I finally went in 2012 but then there's guys like rob 200 wins. He's white. He's won 200 times in off road racing. He's won five out of all the stats over at five Baja 100 by by 1005 by one five hundreds he's, he's the legend of our sport. He raises in trophy trucks, which is not my class.

Speaker 4:          00:07:34       Don't know what, what Baja racing is. Explain that. What rob, why don't you explain it? Since you've done it decades. Absolutely. Bob. One thousands is Baja peninsula basically starting Ensonata race all the way down to the pause. Approximately thousand miles. All dirt road, all dirt roads, some asphalt roads. Sometimes we can't get through dirt. So we have to get up on the highway and actually race down the highway with the traffic. As bud was alluding to, there is no rules. The highways wide open, the race is wide open. There's cattle, there's horses, there's a, are they speed limits on the highway? Now there are, there didn't use to be.

Speaker 3:          00:08:11       Yeah, they didn't use to be. Now you know, we had sanctioning bodies. The sport is growing a little bit and uh, you know, the Mexican government does want rob doing, I can't do 130 miles an hour on the highway. He can, they don't want him to do 139 so they've, they've got us down to 60 but they, it's sections. It's really, it's kind of like in between rounds in a fight, you know, you get jumped on the highway, you get time to relax a little bit, get to take a drink of water, you're crews and 60 miles an hour. And then I had about five miles you'd dump off from the dirt again and you're just hauling ass in the dirt.

Speaker 4:          00:08:37       How fast do you go on the dirt? The top speed that close to one 40. Oh Jesus. Yeah. Yeah. We go cross dry lakes hundred and 3,540 miles an hour through the whoops, you know, two and three foot whoops. Like waves anywhere from 60 all the way up to 120 across them. It's an incredible thing. The, the wheel travel of these trucks is, you know, over 20 inches in the front, over 30 inches in the rear. The tires that we have are 39 inches tall. They cost a lot of money. Luckily both bud and I or spa supported by BF Goodrich. Um, it's an incredible, incredible sport. And like bud was saying, when he got involved with it, he fell in love with it. And I did the same thing back in the early eighties and I'm addicted to it. Um, the ball 1000, it only comes once a year.

Speaker 4:          00:09:22       He tried to win it. If you don't get it done, you got to wait another 365 days. You get down there and do it again. And uh, it, it's, it's an awesome feeling and you can't wait to get down there and do it. So these trucks, they have like some sort of special suspension on them where each wheel is kind of independent and they have a lot of wheel travel so they can hit these big crazy bumps and it's still kind of keeps the thing fairly levels that the, the idea of mindset. Absolutely. Got a great analogy there. Yeah. They're, the front suspension is a arm independent. The rear is actually straight axle, but, uh, with, you know, shocks that are four and a half inches in diameter, coil springs that are five inches in diameter. Uh, the trucks, they work really, really well over the bumps.

Speaker 4:          00:10:04       They're amazing. When you watch them on video, you see the wheels just flopping around like they're just just super loose and a credible thing that it's absolutely amazing. Yeah, they have, um, I know dodge makes a truck that's just like a, a purpose built off road truck that they sell for like civilians for it for instance. Truck. Well I know Ford makes the raptor right, but dodge dodge makes a, an even more hardcore version of it for the ram. You guys are shaking it not just be for people. No, no. We just know the truck industry and both rob and I were in an early stage to develop with the raptor. I raised her APP to know eight. Rob was in the early development of, of the other raptor testing and we just had that conversation about testing Borrego we, we know the truck market pretty well.

Speaker 4:          00:10:47       Dodge has nothing that they've tried to duplicate it is what they've done. There's, there's some something called the ram runner. Yeah, exactly. There's a, Jamie, pull up the video. Dodd raptor versus Ram runner, head to head. This is what I'm referring to. I saw a video online that was a, have you driven one of those yet? No, I've driven the raptor a lot and now they're an incredible vehicle. Um, and I know they're pretty cool that you could buy them. Like really? I mean it's, it's amazing to be able to go to the Ford dealer and, and get a truck that is capable of doing what the Ford Raptor is. I'm, I'm blown away. I've been in the offered industry for a long time and uh, it's absolutely incredible with the, with the raptor can do. Yeah. Our neighbor has one of these things. Use it to go get groceries and see that's the, uh, the difference between them is that the raptor, apparently I've watched the video of the raptor is more comfortable driving around. You could actually use it as a regular car. Where's the ram runner is much more like, you know, one of these things. Something that you really wouldn't drive on the street. Yeah. The railroad. I don't know what it is. I mean, it's probably aftermarket are purpose built by a third party or a second stage manufacturer. It's not, I don't, I mean,

Speaker 5:          00:11:54       so it's not like as mainstream as the raptor, they, they run, they run and I've talked to them, I've been at the plant, they run like eight fon fifties and then they throw it wrapped in there, eight one F-150 he's put a raptor, I mean it's a, it's a real production vehicle. So I high number production vehicle, that was what my point was going to be. It's like this is become this, this type of racing. It's become so popular that the, it's sort of bleeding over into the commercial market. The, the, the regular domesticated human beings are buying these trucks that they could just drive out into the desert and go fucking go crazy and hit bumps with,

Speaker 4:          00:12:28       yeah, I used to see, we call, you know, the flat billers, you know, mimicking the off road truck by an arranger, putting fiberglass fenders on it, raising it up, lowering it. And I think, uh, you know, Ford Motor Company saw that. It's like, hey, we should build something that you can just buy right off the lot. And, and they did that I think a 2008 but and I both went to, got invited to go to the out, do some testing with the raptor and blown away by it. And then they came on the showroom and you're capable of buying those things for under $50,000. So it's an incredible vehicle. Yeah, they're fast as shit.

Speaker 5:          00:13:00       Two right at six to the six is really fast and motor I loader is incredible. I'd beat the crap out of it. And our race, um, did 103 hundred five across the Diablo lake bed. Um, it's an amazing thing.

Speaker 4:          00:13:11       Motor oil, that's a stock motor t that's not even pumped up. My trophy trucks got 900 horsepower. That's why we can do for one 40 split 900 horsepower. Yeah, they're there now they're there. They probably weigh full of gas. 105 gallons of gas gets about two miles a gallon. 900 horsepower, 39 still touch five gallons of gas driving a bomb. In order to get anywhere. In order to get anywhere you've got to have that much gas. Cause the two miles a gallon you won't get very far. It really like it's two miles to the gallon pretty much. That's about the average. That is hilarious. That's hilarious. You have a two mile to the gallon car.

Speaker 4:          00:13:52       Wow. 900 horsepower. It is a bomb. It's the bomb. 900 horsepower. 100 and how many gallons? How many? Hundred and five gallons. Wow. That's crazy. So um, how long can that get you? Like when you, it's not always two miles, right? Like when you're on the highway going 60 days, it'll go up to eight. Yeah, it'll go up to price six. Whoa. Crazy. We, we, we tried to, we tried to go anywhere from a, you know, a hundred 175 miles to two 25 on a tank of gas. I'm with 900 horsepower at the tires. Can't go a whole lot farther when you out there in the desert, spinning them and it just starts tearing the rubber off of him. And two, do you have spares in the back or do you have pitstops do you guys both? Both. We carry two spare tires on the back, but we have to, yeah, just to, but every, every, you know, 175, 225 miles, we have a full on fuel pit. We pull in there and stop. They'll put, you know, a hundred gallons of gas for get it filled back up and change the rear tires on the truck. And then if we happen to have a flat in between spots, you know, they'll, they'll rerock another tire. So we pretty much have that plan to race up and down the Baja peninsula.

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       That's about 1100 mile race will stop every 200 miles if we do the shorter loop races, um, anywhere from 250 to 500 miles or the other races go halfway, do tires and fuel and hit it. So Bud, when we did, for folks who don't know bud produced, he's produced Jesus Christ. A hundred shows me how many shows you produced, produced, overhauling, and rides and rides. When we did that. Barracuda, the, the, the silver Barracuda that we mean that was what, like 2004 or five or since 2005. Yeah. So that was like right around the year that you were, you were beginning to rate

Speaker 3:          00:15:26       yep. Right around the time. And I loved, I loved Jujitsu and I love all the stuff that we used to train together. And this is Kinda my new, my next new passion. I always had to figure out what something new and crazy. Yeah. I'm going to go to Antarctica, I'm going to climb Mt. Everest. I'm going to go do something stupid. This is my something stupid. It was really just a, I had so many TV shows on the air at the time. My sponsors like, hey, we want to treat you once you go down and doing the stupid celebrity race. And then I just haven't returned. Well Bud was,

Speaker 1:          00:15:49       so for folks who don't know was one of the owners of the king of the cage back in the day and button. I mad at Jujitsu. We trained at John Joc Machado's are both students at John jocks and um, you are always involved in a bunch of fucking nutty shit. You're always off doing something. Looney tunes. But this one man, this one's stuck like glue, this Baja thing. Boy, you would get this look in your eye like a fucking junkie when you'd start talking about like a, like a crazed crackhead. Just look to get that next fix. And He came jockey, I'm sure that 900 horsepower car flying around and going 140 miles an hour or bumps.

Speaker 3:          00:16:28       It is nothing like you've ever seen. No, you have to like, I talked to people like a new, a good friend of mine. Um, Andrew Hendricks, he raced Fcca for years, right? So He's, he's got, he's got his Mustang, he's got an Audi, he's racing Scca and uh, the American Le Mans series and they're fast and he's loving it. He took one riding a trophy truck, sold his stuff, and he's got five trophy trucks now and he's gonna start racing. So flat ground got boring. Flat ground always gets point going around with a fucking circle. It's stupid. It's you going around a circle. You're going, I left, left

Speaker 1:          00:16:56       bad for your brain, like bouncing up and down. I talked to a guy who's an expert in a lot of shit. Bad for your brain. That's what I'm saying. My whole life I'm looking at my whole law, my choices and my God, it's amazing. I've talked for a living. What don't, I'm not sure if there's anything I don't do. It is not bad for my brain. But the bouncing around, apparently he was telling me that even just jet skiing like or waterskiing like getting pulled behind a boat and bouncing up and down. He's like, that's really bad for your brain. Like you. There's nowhere in nature where you like, did he, did he hit water and have your head snap up and down like that. And he's like in nature it's like what? Running maybe the occasional jump. You jump over things. You're avoiding animals that are trying to eat you.

Speaker 3:          00:17:45       Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you, you know the human body's an amazing thing. Right? So my very first race, I

Speaker 5:          00:17:50       don't think I could feel my neck or my head for about three days afterwards. My neck was so sore and I at the time, and I've actually been a lot smarter and technologies, they gave me the heaviest, oldest, crappiest helmet. It must have weighed six pounds and here put this on and then it was in the car for 36 hours with this helmet on and I thought my head was going to come off. You get a Mike Tyson neck from that. Yeah. So your body, your workout. I do. I do for training for thing. I put a 25 pound plate on my head and I'm not kidding because I believe you, you got to you, your body starts to evolve and could absorb that and you actually do. And the thing that helps you the most is you is you're almost like a, like a drunk driving.

Speaker 5:          00:18:26       You just relax. Do you seat belts? It just fucking relax. You know you always put like rob and I will go take guys for a ride. We do on occasion, they're over on this, on the holy shit bar and their tents and there are so tense and there were seat belts or sucked and stop breathing too. Yeah. And the, and they suck. They're there. Um, we actually took a seal team. Guy was on my team and oh nine but he put his seat belt so tight it like start hurting their Clavel your clavicle start crushing down. You're stirred and Ms. Turner starts separating from your chest. And I'm not kidding. He's like, I think my heart hurts. I'm like, man, I swear to God. Am I joking? No, absolutely not. My heart hurts. I think it hurt my heart. I'm like, no, you just, what happens is you really, you push so much on the clavicle down, sucking down and your chest is operating your ribs.

Speaker 5:          00:19:05       You just separating, descending your sternum out. So like the area that they cut up and when they give you open heart surgery, it starts separating, gets carved the dry here. And I'm like, you're not having a heart attack. You just put your things to come on Pussy, get out of it. You know, I took Josh Barnett two years ago. Yeah. I know a lot of MMA guys do. It doesn't apple, Eric Apple, he goes down there a lot. No, he's been down there a lot. He does short court racing. Um, for, yeah, he did short course, a lot of racing. He told me he was involved with some horrible, horrible wreck. It was bad. Yeah, he did. He did a nose. Did you see? I think it was like Elsinore. He was in that, um, west coast chill and went over and over and over. And He, uh, yeah, he uh, he got blood in his eye and got all the Funky, he'd say the same execution or leading, yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:19:47       Head bleeding. And he was, he's a novice. He's a great friend of mine and he's an obvious and race as much. Um, but yeah, that was [inaudible]. He's another fucking nut. Right. I mean, he started out his career doing motorcycle racing, a motorcycle racing, and then got into MMA and now another crazy adrenaline junkie. Yup. The, the idea behind this is all based on competition. And just one of the things we were talking about, like there's very little money in this. Yeah. For for it. It's really, you know, it, it's a beautiful sport because you don't really have to have a lot on lending to get in certain classes. And then there's the, like the upper echelon clash, like Rob's class and there's not an, I'll stop talking to him. There's not a lot of money into it, but I don't think there's a lot how much money's in yacht racing.

Speaker 5:          00:20:29       I mean there's all the really big sports or things that are on a bucket list. You know, there's not a lot of money and climbing all met at Mount Everest. It's actually cost you 25 grand if you want to go do it, you, you, it's just one of those things you have to go do. Right. It's passion driven. I mean, we get addicted to it. It's like a drug and we end up spending everything that we have to do it. The smaller cars, the small classes, the, the run anywhere from 20 to 50 grand trophy trucks. Like I drive their $500,000 to go $500,000 truck. Yup. Oh my God. Should pull up a picture. One of those. What, what would he looked for it? A trophy trucks? No, just to Robin [inaudible] one in your site. [inaudible] dot com you'll pull it up. And you know for me too is there's a mystique around Baja for some reason.

Speaker 5:          00:21:12       It all based, you know, you go, the essence of cool is that because you're trying to, is you're trying to figure yourself out in your twenties and your thirties and you look and you look back at Steve Mcqueen, guys like Steve McQueen and James Garner and all these other cool Paul Newman. They all race the race. I mean they, they did this race before and they went down there and they raised, they raised, I mean McQueen almost one in a couple of times. Really. Um, Paul Newman race day when he was 80, he was 80 within their race. I mean these, these cool guys be what killed him and yeah, poor bastard. These cool guys wanted to go down there and race. So there's a cool mystique to it. I mean the list of celebrities and people want to go down there and race. It's just interesting. Yeah, I guess it's a very strange thing that this has become.

Speaker 5:          00:21:52       So is that the truck? Yeah, that's, that's actually an image. You're a trophy truck. That's actually a short core struck there. That's I, I do short course racing too. That's a pro too. Um, why is there a naked girl next to you? Does she raise with you? That would make racing better? Absolutely. That's a rockstar. The image always have the ladies in the posters. Oh, rockstar energy drink. Yeah. Like one of those dudes, like I'm a rock star. I'm out there driving around him. A rock star. Now he's the most humble driver lab. There's a lot of guys out there. I just wanted to let people know who just listening. A lot of people watch this. More people listen and watch it. So the idea behind it came when like what year did this, this, this race get created? I don't know, probably in the, in the early sixties when I hear my version of, yeah, and then I'll fix it.

Speaker 5:          00:22:39       I read once now, uh, in, in 62, I'll tell you exactly the, the, the how it happened is 62 of the Honda Motor Company decided that they were going to, they're going to put out to enduro bikes, right? 1962, Steve McQueen, stunt guy. Um, his name's Dave Eakins. Bud Eakins was his stunt double in a lot of the races, and I'll make this short. They said, how are we going to test these bike and market to Americans? These guys are just racers and idiots and they wanted to go, okay, we're going to go, we're getting swear to God. This is what happened. They went in 1962, they went to Tijuana, they went to western union, they timestamp a card and they went down to La Paz and they timestamp the cart, no navigation, no nothing. And it made the Baja peninsula. That was the very first run in the 60s. That happened. And then all of a sudden, so they did a time, it's kind of like, you know, you know the gumball rally, this is like the gumball rally but on dirt with a huge car. So they did their rally and then they post at a time. It's like we did that in 35 minutes. So then somebody else came back or 35 hours, sorry. They think somebody else came back to this. Okay, wait, well we can beat that. So they didn't 32 hours. And if you look at the heritage of people going down there and saying, I can beat that. And then truck started going there and then cars

Speaker 4:          00:23:45       started going down there. And then in 67, there was, there was a race. 60, 67, there was a race. The Nora right was the first Nora and then, um, an icon my world, right. Uh, Mickey Thompson who's an icon of motor sports for everything that he's done, a land speed and off road and everything. He, the guy that drove the rocket car. Yeah, he did. He, he drove, he built land speed records. Yeah, he did every, he's like Mickey, Mickey Thompson in the motor sports world is just a, it's just a genius. It was like he just to kind of a pioneer and a lot of ways, he was always like ahead of the game. He was always building and pioneering something before it's time. Him and Perlman got together and said let's do a race. So they, they started off in Tiawana and there was a couple hundred guys there.

Speaker 4:          00:24:28       There is, I mean Gardner was in there. Uh, Steve McQueen wasn't, there were guys, I'm not kidding. We've had shoulder pads, like football, shoulder pads on, on a motorcycle drop the flag and they all go wow. Wow. So that's what started it all off yet. It's still wild frontier and it's, I'm telling you there's, there's no rules. Someone's in your way. You Hawk nicely, nicely. And if they don't move, you move them. Like you pump them and let you run into them with cars. Yes. So humans are cars. You're running into humans or you're running into cars, cars, cars. It depends on the day. But for me it's cars. Try not to run into humans. That's not it. But you told me that

Speaker 1:          00:25:09       there's a lot of shenanigans that go on with like the locals, like the locals know that this event is going to take place. A lot of what we talked about, we talked about before we went on live on the air, but besides the fact that they try to touch the cars, like if you see the videos like um, I don't know how much, how much of this stuff can we show? We can't play the music. Is that what it is?

Speaker 4:          00:25:29       No, you can play all the other ones. The other, the other videos I sent you. Um, there's, here's a video right here. Yeah. It's look how wide that fucking thing is. It's about 92 inches wide, which is about 15 inches wider than a normal truck. And then we are going across the dry lake about one 30. And that's your trophy truck? That's a trophy truck. That's bog California. Oh, that looks fun. It is fun. Look how close those people get. Yeah. Down there in Baja. I mean the, this is the biggest sport that they have. And, and they, they wait year round for us to come down there and they, they have uh, you know, such a huge passion for it. Like I do. They at times they want to touch the truck. Well you'll go by and you'll see him trying to reach out and grab the truck.

Speaker 4:          00:26:07       Some of the other things they, the shenanigans they do is a build jumps booby traps we call them. And they, they crashed a lot of cars. But what they're doing is they want to see the excitement. They want to see the truck or the buggy hit the jump and fly through the air and get pictures. One thing it's always funny about Mexico is you see the, they have the, the phone cameras and I think you can piece together your whole race by them with their phone cameras. If they all post that, you could pretty much put the whole race together, styles him. So I'll put it in perspective. So if, um, first of all, the Mexican people are amazing, they're amazing to us and it sounds like I'm making for them, but they are innocent

Speaker 5:          00:26:44       enough or they just decide like they truly, and I had to learn this the hard way. I had a celebrity in my car and I was driving, but it's just a random celebrity. No, I had actually a chip. I had chip Foose with me and my car. Okay. And we're driving and I'm doing about 90, just a rate random dirt road. And I see a bunch of people over here. Right. Okay. I got to make sure to watch them, make sure they're not darting out in front of me. And there's see some random people over here with a fire and there's a lot of them and it's, it's dusk and they both have fires on the side of this road. And I'm like, this is true. What does his fucking people doing on the side of the rode? Boom. And I hit a telephone pole.

Speaker 5:          00:27:17       They buried in the middle of the road, right. And I went up like this and I'm coming down like at 90 miles an hour. I'm like, Oh fuck, this is going to be terrible. Luckily the car absorbed it. We nerfed in, bounced off and kept going. I didn't even see the telephone pole cause I'm an idiot. I'm a Newbie and I'm looking at a bunch of Mexicans over. There's a bunch of guys that's really nice to these people coming out to see it. So they thought it was cute to set up this booby trap just to watch people try to jump it and go flying through the air. Well I think, you know, I think the red necks would do the same thing if you, if you let, if you didn't have those fences, the date the Daytona 500 and they could actually, you know, fix the outcome.

Speaker 5:          00:27:53       Like we're going to, we're going to see if Dale junior could jump this car. Right? Oh for sure they would do it. But that's what it is in Mexico. There's no fences, there's no fences to keep it back there. They're able to go wherever they want. Well and the capabilities of these trucks are pretty extraordinary. They're very different than anything that a NASCAR car could do. They're not necessary. I have a belief because some people throw bottles and shit like that, but I, they are not unnecessarily out to kill us or hurt us because actually after the wreck us, they'll help us. I've had them rec rec before and a booby trap and they'll roll the car over to help you fix a car with a welder. They'll get pimped, you change a tire and they'll push you on your way. They not only throw bottles, but they throw rocks.

Speaker 5:          00:28:30       Sometimes they thrown snakes in the cab of the truck and thrown snakes in the cab of the truck to, you know, it didn't happen to me, but my partner it with mastercraft racing, he, he was coming in and it's an audit coming to the finish at night and they know, yeah, Robbie Pierce from mastercraft, he got a snake thrown in the cab of the truck and holy. Thankfully it's not me cause I don't really care for snakes. What kind of snake? I don't, I don't know. I know [inaudible] is so non poisonous, you're driving 80 miles an hour to snake kits there and you look down and it could be, it might as well be a cobra at that you're really hardcore. You put in your teeth and you keep track at that point you just pull over and get the fuck out of the car. So was technology developed specifically for this race to figure out how to drive fast and hit those bumps? Cause this all, I mean I'm fairly ignorant to, I mean I've, I've, I kind of understand suspensions a kind of see what, but it's pretty obvious when I look at your trophy truck, there's this, some extraordinary equipment on that. Yeah, absolutely. It's, it's developed over the years. You know, like when it, when bud was telling the story earlier about, but it started in the 60s they were taking stock trucks down there, putting a little bit bigger tires on them,

Speaker 4:          00:29:42       taking the windshields item, stuff like that seat, putting some extra seat belts in them. And now it's just developed into, you know, big tall tires that way. Tire and wheel probably weighs 150 pounds a piece. Wow. Shocks $15,000 for a set of shocks for the truck. Nine horsepower. Like I said, uh, some of us has automatic trainees, some of the manual trannies, um, lights, like a baseball stadium of KC lights as a sponsor and run seven of them on the roof and 7:00 AM on the front bumper and you can see a mile down the road and light up the whole desert. And Wow. Over the years it's, you know, we keep developing, making things better and it's the whole ego thing. You want to be the first one to La Paz and you're constantly thinking about what can you do, what can you make? What can you build to make it go faster? Well,

Speaker 3:          00:30:28       go ahead. No, please. No, I mean, and there's an entire industry that was spawned off of this. This is a halo, right? So trophy trucks and Baja racing is a halo for any brand. It doesn't really matter what it is. We, we entertain brands like we sit forward, BF, Goodrich, Casey, they can, they can go down there and conquer Baja. Go pro, you name the company and they want to go to Baja and they always come to me cause I'm, I'm the media guy and they're like how do we do this? I'm like I dunno, I'll hook up with a trophy truck and we'll go beat the shit out of your product and see if it works. It's, there's a whole entire industry. If you go to Sema, which is that big, you know, aftermarket parts thing. There's an entire industry which has dedicated off road and the halo of off road is Baja 1000 racing.

Speaker 3:          00:31:05       It's the halo. It doesn't really, do you know how, when you say it's the halo, what do you mean by that? Yeah, it's, it's really the pinnacle. If you, if you go to racing like Nascar or f one, you know the stuff is developed and then trickles down. So there is a pass through from everything that rob is complete because he complains a lot. Everything that rob complaint, cause it's not fast enough, it's not good enough. You get a 900 horsepower truck that goes two miles to the gallon and he'll talk to his shot covers. I had a shot, I hit this bump one time at 85 miles and I felt it. I felt it. I don't want to feel it. And I drive, I hit it all due respect. He drives a fucking pillow. I mean, I think it drives, it drives. So when you're going over those crazy bumps and shit, you're fairly level nothing. He feels nothing

Speaker 4:          00:31:47       you, you, you, you feel a little bit. But it's, it's incredible. It's, it's a analogy we have is just like riding on a marshmallow. When you jump and you land, it's like just falling, like you're landing on a marshmallow. Wow. And that's the development over all the years. And, and, and thankfully I'm in the trophy truck class, which is the elite class. I've worked my way up from the bottom, driven through them all and definitely don't want to go back. And thanks. Difference. The bottom ones, like what are the, how many classes are there? Well, there's, there's, there's more than 10 classes. There's, there's probably six or eight truck classes and they're six or eight buggy classes and there's also motorcycles and ATVs. Utvs all these, there ends up being over 20 classes at the bottom, 1000 and, and they all compete against their own class. They all started their own time together against a clock. They don't, we're not racing. We were racing all together the track the same time. But we're separated by start time. So you're really racing clock. You do

Speaker 1:          00:32:39       have traffic. You do have to get by the guys, um, to, to get the win. I'm so used to bud jumping. So when you're, when you're driving these things, it's very different than the cheaper trucks. Yeah. I want to say cheaper cause none of them are cheap. But the different clouds, different classes. Cause you got an entry level class. Exactly. You got to have your entry level classes and there are a lot more stock. They don't have as much. We'll travel. They got eight or 10 inches of wheel travel and the truck's smaller tires. They're just a restricted a lot more and those cars are a lot more difficult. They beat you up a lot more. They take a lot longer to get down the down the peninsula. Yeah. That's what I was going to get at. So like when you first started out, you took much more of a beating.

Speaker 1:          00:33:25       Absolutely. So now like that's, that's why you're into these really cushy rides. Like you've been there, done that, been there, done that. I want to work my way up and, and get to the top of the sport. I'm doing it for 30 years and I've been in the elite class since the mid nineties. So this is a good vehicle for the apocalypse except for the fact that he uses so much fuel. If you have gun, you can get fuel. Yeah. We got to make your own fuel at a certain point in time. You're not running diesel. Right. Yeah. See that's the problem. You know, Neil young makes his own diesel. I think Daryl Hannah makes her own ds. A lot of vegetable oil and crap like that. Yeah. Well Neil Young, uh, apparently has this gigantic farm. He has like a thousand plus Acre ranch in northern California and he makes his own bio diesel and runs all his vehicles off of his own gasoline.

Speaker 1:          00:34:12       So he's called politely, totally off the grid. They like a conversion on the old Mercedes. Yeah. You can do a conversion on any kind of old car. Well, not even new cars. Apparently. You want to do conversions to biodiesel? Yeah. Yeah. We have to. We have to actually, I was going to run one year. I was, I was working on that show. That picture of Jamie. What'd you put up? Neil Young's 59 Lincoln runs on bio diesel and give me plugged in. Wow. I like that. That's pretty dope. I was working on a dealer. I was going to do a truck and all electric truck down there. Oh, switching out gas. Is that possible? Yeah, it's possible. I mean the, the lithium batteries because I was involved with a truck company and then they, you know, my answer is very stuck. Like how, what can we do to market this thing and read it?

Speaker 1:          00:34:53       I don't really care what it is. It can be, right. It could be a mini bike. My answers race it. We should probably go race it. Right. I don't care. Could you do a, I mean is it feasible that you could have enough battery power to do that? Sure. Yeah. In a tour could be amazing. That's why I want to do it. Torque on those. The Electric Motors are amazing. The problem is I don't think you would go. Our pits, my pits, not his, my pits are about 120 miles apart and that'd be hard to get there. Yeah. My Buddy Aubrey has one of those Teslas. Right. And the pickup is incredible. Like I was really shocked at how fast those things go. Like the zero to 60 in like four seconds. Right. It's bananas and it's weird because there's no gears. It's just you're just going, it's not like man, it's just, it's very much like a space ship and then you just, you hit the grass completely silent. I mean, you hear the tires rolling on the rubber, the rubber rolling on the concrete and that's it. You don't, you don't hear anything. It's a very strange, that'd be a little bit scary in Baja because the spectators, you're, they're used to here in the race vehicle come into electric. They probably wouldn't hear it coming, right? Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:35:55       we can play that annoys Erica. We can play that polka music or something like that.

Speaker 1:          00:35:58       Yeah. There you go. Um, how many, you would have to have so many batteries though. What I'm thinking is like a Tesla. If you go from the beginning fully charged to the end, you're getting like 300 miles I think.

Speaker 3:          00:36:11       Yeah. But that's all I would need to do. We planned it out. It'd be 120 miles who charged. So we would, you build a carriage underneath, which are about seven, 800 pounds of batteries and then you get to the next pit. You have a fully charged set of hours. You drop that carriage, put the carriage in, bolted back up. I'd be in my own class and I can provide them whatever company was. Um, at the time it was a company called Phoenix. I can provide them with a Baja 1000 win as a market

Speaker 1:          00:36:32       has I'm fully answered or any of these other country, any of the other companies have ever thought about doing something like that.

Speaker 3:          00:36:39       Forward is amazing at it because they do use Baja a lot. Last year, um, I raced a brand, the brand new F-150 the 2015 F-150 which is a twin tube charged v six in the stock class. That stock suspension stock everything stock on the car it twin Turbo Charge v six and then we did the raptor together. I did the wrap to wait, he was on the testing and I raced the F-150 last last year.

Speaker 1:          00:37:00       And when you race in F-150, how much of it is different than what you would borrow off the showroom floor?

Speaker 3:          00:37:06       Nothing. Roll cage. We had we a fuel cell roll cage, spare tire. That one I had, I had a radio and we had cup holders. I remember looking at some of the videos. It's a cup holder in there. You can look it up online. F-150 race, the Baja 1000 there's me and you're going to laugh at me. That's it right there. Uh, no, that seems pretty different. No, it's different. Not, no. You'll see my, it's, it's the 2012 bond and they pissed me off because I told them they did this to make me mad. But they haven't, they made me wear a white driving suit.

Speaker 1:          00:37:34       Folks. You don't know bug. Where's bud? You're, you're the weirdest fucking dude I've ever met. When it comes to clothes, he'd go over Bud's house. He's got all black pants, all black shirts. His whole fucking wardrobe. His entire closet is black shirts, black pants, black tee shirts, black underwear, I'm assuming. Yeah. Black socks. Black socks. Black sneakers. Yup. He just doesn't want to think about colors. No. So when they hit you with some white, did you wear it or did you just get a marker? Sharp?

Speaker 3:          00:38:03       I was, I was pretty up. Luckily I didn't have to get in the car at the beginning and I am, the rain was, uh, the weather was pretty cold, so I had a black slicker. I put them on.

Speaker 1:          00:38:11       So it rained on you and you rolled around the dirt and you white drivers seat. I've been trying to get bud high for so long to get them to smoke pot and I'm like, the first thing you need to do is throw away those fucking black clothes. You're going to go, wow, look at all these pretty colors. I could choose. Just let me get a skill. Let me get a little wearing pastels. You'll start enjoying different colors. Just start realizing how ridiculous turned to an Andy Dick and you can wear pastels and shot Andy Dick. I'm saying you have an appreciation for other colors. No, no.

Speaker 3:          00:38:46       I think if I smoked pot, which I'm not going to, I'd be more into the dark lord world and world and I'll have just maybe skulls in my tee shirts.

Speaker 1:          00:38:53       Wow. You would get darker? Yeah. Okay. Now when you drive an F150, do you use like regular tires of like you'd take tires that are right off of a showroom floor? We had the new BF Goodrich, k o two is that we raised on this, on this truck, normal suspension, regular F-150 suspension doc dude. We went hunting at to hone ranch up in a northern, like a, it's near Bakersfield for TV, right? You did that, that team? No, this was a recent one. We went wild pig hunting to hone ranches. Uh, this huge ranch. It's a 1,700,000 acres, biggest ranch in California. Huge place. And uh, this guy, Cody, who was one of the guides there, one of the hunting guides drove us all around an F150 and I'm ain't talking horrific terrain and this fucking thing is driving over rocks and, and I, I was so impressed. I was like, this is like one of the best commercials for an F150 you could ever get. Just going to, like, if you're thinking about buying one of these things, what's an F-150 k below go fucking drive around to hone ranch for a couple of days and one of these things and think if you would want to do this. I don't anything else.

Speaker 3:          00:39:57       This is, this is what I, oh, that's the wrap to that. Rob. Rob and I were involved with the development of, so that's a, that's a custom raptor. That's not like a, yeah, we raised that in class eight and we, we built it out but it, it, that one's still had to stock motor. Um, yeah. Stock, motor stocked Dash. We did have, we did have custom suspension on it is actually, that's what caused me to race the F150 last year is they go, okay well we built the raptor a little bit and you know, people start chatting now online like oh that wasn't really stock. So they made us raise a stock car.

Speaker 1:          00:40:27       Wow. So just not even a raptor, just a regular F150 regular F150 regular. Now did you bottom out at all with that? Um, that's probably an understatement. Yeah. Yeah. You don't bottom out with your truck? Uh, we do, but we're going three times as fast as the stock truck so it bottoms out. You don't feel quite as bad. It doesn't do as much damage. So the bottom of your F-150 was completely stock as well? No, no plates or anything.

Speaker 3:          00:40:53       We, no, we did. We had, um, we definitely had a skid plate underneath the front of them to protect the motor underneath. Yeah. Cause we bought them down a lot. That's what you see in the front of the raptor. That front piece that skipped down. That's a skid plate. Yep. So you just installed something along those lines. Yep. That's it. Yep. Wow. And then after we raced it and then the car was in such good shape, but I can't even believe cause this year was what? Last year. It's to pull up that video. F150 races Baja. Yeah, it's a 2000 it, you'll see it. We put it up online. I'm the FordF one 50 new F-150 races, concrete ball. Um, they, uh, this was a tough 2012, 2013. Sorry. It was the single toughest Baja thousand I've ever seen. I, I don't know Roger Norman,

Speaker 5:          00:41:34       who owns score decided to, it was his first ball. 1000 courses is my opinion. I'll let rob talk. It was his first Baja 1000. He wanted to make a statement and he's a former racer. He wanted to make it the worst fucking course you ever, ever could drive. And it was tough. It was hard and slow and fast and gnarly. And how did they change it? He just marks the course. She goes, this is the F150. This is it. Right. That's it. That's amazing. That's a stock F150 which is the lights on it. Yup. Wow. That's you driving that thing. Yep. I have the blue helmet sitting in my two great F-150 fucking commercial. I mean, Ford's really smart doing this. I'm, I'm fucking never thought about racing in my life and now I'm thinking, God, I got to do this. Goes wrong. You got do right next time.

Speaker 5:          00:42:15       Here's the way to go. Then you go straight to the top trophy truck. Next time you're in Vegas, he lives in Vegas. Next time you have Vegas, he'll take you out to prim and go for a ride. You'll shit yourself. I'm there in May. I'm there in May for the UFC incontinent. You'll be what? We'll make a deal. I'll get you UFC tickets. You a, he'd take me for a fucking beat ride in the desert. We're in love that Amber Love to go to the beautiful, it's good event to Tj Dillashaw versus Hanan. Barao it should be fun. Um, now you guys have been involved in this for a long time. How much is the popularity increased over the last few years? Because it seems like there's a lot of exposure. Like I'm hearing about it all the time. Maybe I'm hearing about it just because I'm friends with bud, but I mean, I'm seeing it online.

Speaker 5:          00:42:57       I'm seeing like a lot of these crazy like ram runner type trucks are being built. Yeah. Popularity. It's, it's, you know, I've known for 32 years and it's, it's increased. Um, Bud's definitely helping out a lot with score this year, you know, with television production, getting us out there on TV, putting very good shows together. I think here at the end of April and April 20th, April 20th. Yeah, we did it. We just did a deal with CBS. You know, I just, I told him this great story that I won. I won my race in 2012 in my class. And then Roger Norman, who was a new owner, came up to me and swear to God, he's like, well, now you're a champion. You can produce TV. For me. It was what he said to me. It's like great and I get to happy cause you know, you know me as I do, I do TV, I do all my stuff.

Speaker 5:          00:43:38       So now I get to kind of merge and I always see them to this merge my two hobbies together. When I was doing Jujitsu, we had king of the cage. Right, right. Cause I gotta have a reason and I really a television vehicle to do something cause then I get to be kind of be cool in this sport. Well you're kind of a workaholic and it's, it helps you when you're doing Jujitsu. Well you know, hey I need to know what the fuck's going on when I'm watching fights. It's exactly right. So it's, so it's a way to sort of make a hobby, a part of your job. But you do my immersion style, like robble, he's like, I've raced for 10 years and now I'm producing a TV. There's not much, I haven't done their experience down there. Not like rob has, but he, I, I know the racers feel comfortable. Just like you know when you're commentating a fight, it's a fight or you feel comfortable that you, you're commentating God, you know what the fuck they're doing. The setups, I know what they're doing in the car. I'd been on the course and not, not in, not in the super trucks, but I've been down there going, I know that course. I know what he's doing. This is what happens. That's a booby trap.

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       Some were editing the show. I get to bring my experience into it. Yeah. That's got to help a lot for, for the riders, for the drivers. Absolutely. He has as much or more passionate than I do. Just just riding around with him today and listen to him talk about all the stuff and how jacked up he gets when he watches the videos and stuff. He's like a kid in the candy store and yeah, buds fucking show rides is what got me to, I never thought about buying a classic car, but I watched his show rides. I'm like, God damn, I want to carry one of those. That looks fucking cool. I think the show's coming back. By the way. This just coming back. It should come back to you have Christ right back there. You could put two more cars. I this space. I got a little garage.

Speaker 1:          00:45:08       You can put two cars. I'm thinking of expanding, thinking, getting a bigger place that I got to put an archery range and there's a will. There's an archery range here. We, whether either know it or not, there's targets in the back and there's a straight shot 28 yards from the front door to the back. You got to tag the Werewolf cause that what you got to, I've I've a compound bow sight back there. Uh, it's normal. It compound bow a target back there. Absolutely normal. Well my new thing is hunting and I've been doing that the last couple of years. I'm fucking bananas about that. The way your banana, it's about racing. So I'm trying to incorporate that into my life. And will we do that to them? Yeah. They would kill animals on the race course every once in a while. Yeah. But I don't think that's hunting.

Speaker 1:          00:45:47       Oh, I think that's just traffic jam. That's just a livestock getting on the race course back to uh, the course getting tougher. How did they make the course tougher, rob? You can enter that. Roger looks at the maps, tries to figure out the roughest worse spots on the whole Baja peninsula and then tries to mark the course so it goes through all that. He wanted to make a statement. We wanted to make Baja tougher than ever. And he, he did it last 2013 it was a loop race from Ensonata to Ensonata. It wasn't a peninsula run, but he went to all the worst parts of Baja and had us run through it. So they changed the actual place you go to. So there's no real benefit. Oh, every year. Every year. Every year the course gets different. Absolutely. Every year it's different. Maybe runs the opposite direction, just different different areas because that becomes a big issue with like say like the Nurburgring, which is the benchmark that they use to test performance cars there the issue becomes when guys have raced in Newburg ring so many times, they know exactly when to slow down exactly when you speed up and that has a big effect on those Nurburg Ring Times because you know everyone's chasing that seven minute time around the Nurburgring and now sub seven minute in that portion, nine 18 they've managed to go sub seven minutes.

Speaker 1:          00:47:01       She just fucking insane. But a lot of that is those guys knowing that course. Absolutely. Then you don't have that. No. Our stuff changes every time. It's different. Even loop races every time you come around there's already been a hundred other cars that had been there since you had, it's completely different. Silt beds, rocks or moved. So that's part of the thing that's so interesting about our sport is never the same. Well, it's interesting. It's also the mayhem starts with the organizer. So I want to put in perspective for, so you know what a tough mudder is, right? Um,

Speaker 5:          00:47:30       I've heard the expression, so at tough mudder or those, you know those races they put through obstacle courses and through mud holes and you're going to take over year to climb up a wall and to go through fire and crawl through Barb wire fence. This is like a tough mudder. Our organizer, which is Roger and some of the guys who mark the course, they want, they, they, it start, the mayhem starts with them because they'll put us through shit and they know we're going to get stuck or they'll go, if he's not paying attention, he's going to hit that rock. He was going to go flip it off the edge and that'll be great. These guys are sadistic pricks. So there's saying yes, you're going to set up a rock there to make sure we're going to set up the course by rock. So if you don't pay attention, you're going to go flying off the edge of a cliff.

Speaker 5:          00:48:08       Yes, and I've been, I'm not kidding. Sometimes there'll be, it's really weird. You'll be reading the terrain and reading the terrain. You'll come up over this rise and there's lefthand turn, and if you don't pay attention, you're off Jesus Christ. If it starts with this statistic pricks that are down there, mark the course. Am I wrong? No, absolutely right. Well, you told me once that you were driving and you came upon a wreck and a guy had his bone sticking through his leg when a guy broke his leg. Right. And you if flipped off the side of a cliff and you had to get down there and locals are starting to creep in and it got real sketchy. No, no, that wasn't, that wasn't a, you're mixing two stories, you mean? I'm like, yeah, the Josh Barnett story in our rec. We had my team in Oh seven the BF Goodrich Shimo seven had one of the worst wrecks in the planet.

Speaker 5:          00:48:55       Everybody thought the two drivers who were dead and I had to go in and get them. And this is part of, again, this is an adventure race. It's not car racing. This is an adventure race. And what happened in ours. This is our BC car went off the cliff into San Javier and to guys like us, you say he went off the cliff at son Javier is fucking crazy cause it's far, uh, 300 feet. And there are sections on the course where they're inverted where it's like this and you just hit the car, dropped 300 feet, rolled seven times, 300 feet, destroyed the car. And I didn't know cause I went, we were just talking about it cause I went, I was down in Loretto, we went down to La Paz and I got a call to go back to Loreto cause our cars in trouble and we can't find the car and I didn't know where he's at.

Speaker 5:          00:49:37       And then the guys in the car call my wife two o'clock in the morning, that's not good. They call my wife on the sat phone even though I told him how to use a sat phone. No like, and they sound all fucked up. They're like us bud there. And nature's like what the fuck? So she calls me on my sad phone goes like somebody just called here from the house and like, all right, where would they say the way that thick? No, they just hung up. So now our car is off the course. We know it's not moving because we can track it. We don't know where they're at. We could kind of tell way they were, they were the last time. So I did this again. This is an adventure race and Rob's got 7 million of these stories. I'll tell you one stupid story and then I'll shut up cause I've been talking too much. He keeps saying I'm going to shut up. You better stop. Good. Supposed to shut up. You're supposed to be here doing a podcast but not on me. I self deprecating you. Fuck, I'm the dude. Tried to get my friend tell you goddamn story.

Speaker 3:          00:50:27       Alright, so we exists, we're racing and I remembered it was Kenny Barcher might these two guys in the car. There was Tracy Jordan was a rock crawler, king of the hammers guy and Kenny Bartram. Candy bars was just, you know, famous guy who he cowboy Kenny does. Uh, he does a new kind of cowboy stuff and he's an Fmx guys of Mozart, motocross guy. So I told him I to get in the car, San Javier is very dangerous. Settle yourself down, get you sign Javier, and then you can haul ass, you know, down to La Paz, no problem. 13 miles from the pit, 13 miles from the pit. It's straight down. And he knows I'm not lying. There's a twisty road and there's cliffs on one side, you're on the side of the mountain for 13 miles and there's clips on the side road. Real tight, twisty stuff. Don't make a mistake.

Speaker 3:          00:51:08       And let me tell you why, because 200 years ago, some priest, this is actually true, 200 years ago, some priest on a donkey, they used to, what they used to do with emissions, they used to be two days. Missions used to be two days apart. They'd set a mission here and then him and a donkey and somebody else would go up a road. And when after the second day they'd land and they build another mission right there. And then two days later they do it. So up this hill, this donkey trail going up this hill, this guy and I talked to him, I had Thanksgiving dinner with him. He hung the wheel off it off the corner and said, Oh shit, hold on. Six Times he counted the rev, the revolutions going over and over and all of a sudden there was nothing. And then they hit and the code drive was knocked out.

Speaker 3:          00:51:48       He had a compression brews from his helmet, um, compression boots. His helmet got hit and they put a bruise on his skull from the, from the roll cage. So I ha, so my story is I get to Loreto and nobody's there were sold before behind. There was no pit, there's no support. And there's one guy picking up cans. I'm in my race suit, I studied Jujitsu. I'm a bad ass. Right. Okay. So like I go up to this guy and I look at him and he's an older guy, he's in his sixties I really didn't feel like talking. I just said, give me your keys. He looked at me, excuse me. I said, give me your keys. I have an injured driver. I need your truck. So he reaches in his pocket. I was going to beat his ass. I didn't care. I was going to take his truck and I'd take his truck.

Speaker 3:          00:52:29       I have an injured driver on the course. So why wouldn't you just ask them to help you? Yeah, I dunno. Full with adrenaline and crazy and I was tired. And you stay up for three days and go ask some guy from, I'm not standing up for three minutes and you stay up for 36 hours and then go. He said, excuse me sir, can I, I'm not English. So he said, give me your keys. I said, gimme your keys. You lucky you didn't get shot. Yeah, that's true. So he reaches in his pocket and he hands out and he goes, can I go with you? I'm like, sure, get in. So I grab this, I grab his truck and it was a stock Toyota truck and we go down this river bed, did that riverbed, which is terrible by, it took me two hours to go 13 miles and the stock Toyota truck, little tiny itty bit like a mini truck.

Speaker 3:          00:53:08       We got to San Javier, went up searching forums, stopping every time that there was a crest. Every time that I thought momentum could take a driver off, we'd stop search, couldn't find them. So two hours we finally found them. It was still night. Well it was it still night I found them and my co driver got, had a concussion. He's vomiting, he's peeing, peeing, pissing himself. He smelled like shit. Got picked up. My two drivers with down there and the scavengers are already started taking wheels off the car, gps, anything you can get off the car. You were already doing that while the guys were inside the car, guys were already there. He got off the top of the um, out of the gully and they were already down there picking. So I went back down there to get my sat phone and get my other stuff.

Speaker 3:          00:53:48       And I'm like, get the fuck away. You gotta I'm shooting the Mexicans the way that we're already picking this car apart. Wow. And uh, so I get Tracy back in the car. Um, and this is, these are stories, these happen every, that's why it's an adventure race. I'm not like, I went to the drag strip and it did nine seconds. I got Tracy back in the car two and a half hours back and we stopped cause he had to vomit every, every like every 15 minutes. Like hold on, goes well and he's vomiting. He got a concussion, bad concussion. So we get him back. He's okay. We get him into Loreto as I'm gonna get him out. We were in Lauretta, we got him down to La Paz and by that time it was seven, eight o'clock in the morning and taken to the emergency room. Probably not advisable, but took an emergency room. I told that like, yeah, I told the doctor is Spanish that he or he heard his dick and he's got to check his dick.

Speaker 6:          00:54:33       So the doctor, so the doctor needs got to take your pants off. He starts shaking his pants. Tracy's Georgia, swear to God, he's looking at me. He's like, why is he out? I go, I told him you hurt your Dick. God. Oh, so how many people have died

Speaker 4:          00:54:54       doing this race? Eh, there's every, every year. So there's, there's probably probably one motorcycle or the biggest thing is there's accidents on the highway. It's not actually that race cars that happened, but uh, because of the race starts and Ensonata goes all the way to the pause. We raced all the way through the day, through the night, into the next day. And I usually, a lot of the accidents happen there on the highway with, with the, the spectator traffic or the chase traffic, race, race cars. Not Too often.

Speaker 3:          00:55:19       Not Too often. Motorcycle guys get hurt a lot. I mean, Josh Barnett hit him more to software guy and uh, in 13 or 12, in 2012, he had a motorcycle guy. But what happened was that, uh, you know, it's funny. Monster Energy called me and they said they wanted to do I know any, um, any athletes or any athletes are superstars and want to come down and race cars. They were out. I'm like, yeah. So I called Josh. I know. He's like, he's the ultimate gearhead and two gearheads. If you say, hey, you want to come race, he two weeks notice never raced off road in his life. I had him in a car. He comes down there to like the next week I put it in my, we do some training down, down to the sterile beach, show them how to work in the car and next thing he's in a race. Poor fucker. He's like a 19. He was 19 hours. He went like, took him 19 hours. You'd like the first stent like three, like 300 miles. He's going through a silt bed. There was a motorcycle guy clips him and breaks his leg. Now, Josh did one of the most amazing things. I'm not saying that rob wouldn't do this. So Josh Barnett, do you know who he is? No. Youngest ever. UFC heavyweight champion. Super Great Guy. Super Great Guy. I had him on the podcast. He's probably one of the best podcasts

Speaker 5:          00:56:24       guest, excuse me, one of the best podcast guests I've ever had. He's super intelligent guy. Yeah, he's so smart. Heavyweight fighter. Amazing, amazing grappler, amazing fighter. And He loves cars. He has a Shelby, he's got, he's got all kinds of cars and he loves it. He's a fucking nut. So he goes down there into a silk, the silk bed, um, and he wanted to get, he wants to get around it, but you don't really have control. And the silt bed, you can hit it. Sometimes you hit a Rut and it throws your ride a little bit. He hit this guy and broke his leg, compound fracture in his leg. So he gets through the silt bed. And not a lot of guys that do this, by the way. I'm just telling you, it's just like for the first time being down there. So he and he feels like shit and he'll tell you this story, but he pulls off to the side of the court, goes in the silt bed, which is dangerous, by the way, pulls the Guy Morton Morton, the guy's motorcycle out.

Speaker 5:          00:57:11       So no other cars hit it and then picks the guy up, walks him out and puts them on the hood of his car. Calls in, waits for a helicopter to come, helicopter comes. Josh carries this guy with a compound fractured leg into the helicopter, drops him a helicopter, then puts his helmet back on and continuous race. And then he rolled it. He rolled his truck after all that. There's Josh. Oh yeah, that's the rest of the pitcher right there. That's it. That's his buggy monster energy truck. Wow. So you were talking about the dude who raced on flat surfaces and then just gave it up and started doing only this kind of dirt. Crazy shit. There's not a lot of these courses though, right? It's like you could go, there's a lot of race courses around the country where the average person can go and do, you know, a, a track day and put on a helmet and drive fast on a course.

Speaker 5:          00:58:03       How many courses are there like this where a guy can just go out and it's unlimited Baja. There's, there's roads everywhere. Um, go down there and, and practice or run or play. You'd have to go to Mexico to do it. There's, there's some stuff in the, in the states. Well, there's a lot of races by the way. Yeah. There's, I mean, he does short course. You can, you can, you can gear up in a pro of pro four, pretty easy. And you go short court, race and then long there's, um, there's two organizations. There's obviously score and there's a couple of other organizations that do, you know, the mint, the mint 400 with rob races in a best in desert robberies. And I've done some stuff in the, in Arizona, Nevada, you, there's a lot of race. So there are a few courses. Are there courses or is it just organizations?

Speaker 5:          00:58:43       We build courses. They're all, every off road race is unique. Uh, okay. So now like what if saved, someone's listening to this and they're like, you know what? I need some goddamn adventure in my life. Best thing. Dues look up score, score schedules, score, score, score on that tubs, strip club in New York City in Atlanta. No, that's wherever it is. I don't know anything about those places. Scoring and national. Yeah. Score in national. Looked up on the internet, look at the schedule, find out where the race is, our go check one out. There's a lot of other races and organizations that race all over. Um, you know the western United States, there's almost awkward race just about every weekend, somewhere, somewhere in western us

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       you can, and for some folks they just go quote unquote off-roading. So they just get a truck and find a spot where they are allowed to drive and just go nutty. Yeah, that's, that's, those are jeep adventure guys. The guys go like Moab and they go real slow. And that's not what we do, dad. I don't get that crawling. Look, I made it up the rock dude. I could walk quicker than that. You stupid fuck that Rockwell in your truck that you need to get up to the top of the rock with it. You know, that doesn't make any sense to me. No. Yeah, I don't get the rock crawling. It's, it's slow. Speed is, it's pretty incredible. I did a rock crawling is actually rock race. So with the Rockies, well there's different things. Rock crawling is one thing, racing slow and then racing slow, but it's, it's pretty wild that when they do the, it's, I think it's the event's called King of the hammers and you climb up some rocks that you can't even climb with your hands, but you get in this modified unlimited vehicle that very expensive on top of it.

Speaker 4:          01:00:18       Same with even bigger tires. And we have, and they just go right up at like, you're like, you're actually crawling a little, you can't cry, you can't climb it now. You can't climb it with your, your, your, you can't, it's very hard for you to climb it as a human being. But this car will pull up to it or this truck kind of like a jeep, but it's highly modified. It's, it's difference between like a stock forward F-150 and a trophy truck. It's like a stock jeep and an unlimited, I think they call them ultra force and they're, they're incredible. What they'll do, they'll go up incredible rock climbing events, straight faces. You'll see some of the internet stuff is fascinating. It's crazy. But it is slow. It's racing slow. Well I guarantee you somebody who your climate theology are those free climber dude. Like those Alex Arnold, guys that go up the, you know, they, they go up things that aren't even flat.

Speaker 4:          01:01:02       They're leaning towards you. He said you couldn't climb it. I could climb it. Don't fucking test me bud. I'll fucking climate right now bitch. The um, the, the, the industry like, must be like, it must be a huge thing. Like building all these different things and be, people must be getting involved in this recreationally and building these like trucks and taking the regular trucks and adding all this stuff to it. And it's just like hot rodding. I mean you have, you have a geyser, right? Yeah. There's, there's, there's the guys who brothers built trophy trucks. Jim Koch builds trophy trucks. There's probably, there's probably five or six builders that do trophy trucks. And then you have all your, your guys that work out of their own shops, smaller building their own stuff. So that's, you know, but alluded earlier, there's really no rules. Trophy trucks. The rules are it can't fly.

Speaker 4:          01:01:51       You could have unlimited suspension. It has to have a body like a truck body, which is fiberglass and it can't fly. It has to stay on the ground. So it's, it's a unique thing. You can pretty much brainstorm with whatever you can to try to go out there and beat your competition. Oh, that's what's innovative about the sport with you. When you give guys a limited horsepower, limited this, do anything you want. Actually, there is one rule that I'll tell you that I saw that and you'll remember this story really well. There's actually only one rule that I know of actually. Um, but you, you get to, you get it. Especially in competition. You get to breed the best of the

Speaker 5:          01:02:20       human mind because he's trying to beat this other guy. I'm going to kick his ass. So here's the one rule. Oh eight oh seven I think is oh seven right? There's a guy named Brian Collins. Swear to God. This happened. They took a fueling system off an Apache helicopter, right? Stuck it off the back of their truck and they had a fueling truck that would walk up to it while they're moving and jam it in the back of it and refuel it. Why they're moving. And finally a score. It was that, oh seven Oh eight when was that? I think it was, I think it was Mark Miller and Ryan, our cro, holy man, they did it on the highway. They, they, they developed a system on a, on a regular chase truck that was following the race truck down the highway and the fuel was in the bed of the chase truck and they had a pressurized system.

Speaker 5:          01:03:02       If they pulled up why they're going 60 miles an hour down the highway. They pulled up behind the race truck and it had like a, like a nozzle out the front of it and they stabbed it into the nozzle that was on the race truck and they filled it, Jesus Christ. So they could save four minutes. They could save two or three minutes in the pin, not even supposed to smoke when you were at a gas station. I think that's a rule. It's like no more, no more fueling way. Goal number highway. Supposed to use your cell phone while you're at a gas station because very rarely a spark and electronic spark can ignite fumes and you can burst into flames. Like that's happened before and he's talking crazy assholes. I go at 60 miles an hour filling in their car up on the highway. I remember once I was with a herps team that year.

Speaker 5:          01:03:45       I forgot what it was and herps. Yeah. Herps like herpes. Uh, no. Life's terrible. Herb's like in Vegas, the herps gas stations, the herps hotel, I don't know what that is. They're pretty big. They're, they're there a day of the herps hotels, right on paradise. That's a terrible place to go and stay. Get sorry for the people who own it, but just the doping don't be sorry for the name. Yeah, we're going to stay at the Herbst. Good luck. I got that. Got The herps. Yeah, I got to the herps shit. You're going to be okay. Did you take your medication? Use some antibacterial soap, so I didn't know I was with them. What else? I won't say their name again. I was with them and we saw that and were like, we're all kind of like, ah, that's pretty cool. And did they win that year?

Speaker 5:          01:04:28       Yeah, they did one that year because of that, while saving time. There's more to it than just that. But it helps you think that saved throughout the thousand mile race. Probably 10 minutes, 10 minutes at a time instead of stopping in the pit. And that matters. Absolutely. Now no one's sleeping. You guys are just driving everybody in the race truck, they're driving the whole way. Some people solo. They drive the whole thousand mile race without getting out of the truck drive the whole way. I've done that in the past. Do you have a diaper on cod? They have these catheters. Oh cause his kid is a tube in your Dick and your hobby is way out of control when you put that bad that's not a tube. And your texting is a catheter. Right. My favorite things, I like having it. Like I read Kevin, it's you live in Dick. No, cause it's not what it is, but it's the best thing that's ever happened for off road for me. It is amazing. It goes over the top like a, like a, Oh like a condom. Right. And then

Speaker 4:          01:05:18       a rubber hose connected to the end of that. That goes all the way down the inside of your leg and you taped at the end of the hose to the side of your shoe so you can piss in your shoe next to you shoots. The best thing I know it's in the truck and somebody just [inaudible]. Some people have done that though. They don't get the tube out of their shoe before they start racing and they're actually finding out their p and that's another great story. Ivan Stewart, who's a legend in your foot out the window and then we don't have carpet. It's all metal. Aluminum down there as a hole in the floor. Yeah, that there's leaks, there's little panels and stuff and so you just pee on the floor and just hope it goes away somewhere. Yeah, it does. It does. Well, the best thing is you pulled in the pits, you start paying, you tell your, your, your mechanic was like, I think I've got a leak and he's down there sniffing it.

Speaker 4:          01:05:58       That's a great, that story, right? There's happened multiple times and the, the one I was going to tell you about, it's Ivan Stewart icon of the sport was that the start line and warm in his truck up. He's just about ready to go off the start line and all of a sudden underneath his truck there's, there's liquid in one of his mechanics jumps underneath her like, Holy Shit, what does that goes? Touches his finger in it, comes up, smells it, and realizes what it is that Ivan's actually taken a piss. It didn't mean to ruin your story, but for your listeners, by the way, get a Catherine, go online, get a race catheter. The best things like, um, like in a bar. I did the race or UFC fight or UFC fight. I did, I did this. I have to miss anything. Yeah, but then you get a p on the ground.

Speaker 4:          01:06:36       Yeah. You can compete in the bar near drain. It's fine. I was, I would have this blue water. I was at this blue water race in Arizona one time. Uh, I think it was Greg Fouts and we got our ass kicked. We're just putting around. We got stuck a couple of times. I'll stock full. So we actually got to the bar and we were, it felt like a dick by the way. And I had my race suit on because we came in so late. But the bar is gone and everybody's there and they're having a celebration. I just kept my catheter on instead of him. So I'm just sitting at the bar. I'm like, I get next to somebody. Just start peeing. Ah, okay. Okay, and you're done. You don't have to come. You just pee on the ground of the bar. You son of a bitch.

Speaker 4:          01:07:06       I can't believe you think that's funny. How dare you. What about the person that owns that par? You're just peeing in their establishment right on the floor for a beer. I don't give a fuck that guy. Somebody has to buy the beer, bring it there. If somebody has to pay to be, put the refrigerator in and turn it on. Don't feel sorry. Eight Bucks, eight bucks. Don't buy it. That's what it looks like. Black cat. Yeah. That's one of the brands right there. Wow. That. That is ridiculous. When you're in a sport, when you have to have a hose taped over your deck. Maybe there's a problem with that. Support babies. You don't bribe. You don't drink coffee. No, never. Never. When I was a kid, my mom, dad drink coffee. I couldn't stand the smell. Probably got to early twenties or so, realized I'd never had it and said, you know what I'm going to do without it.

Speaker 4:          01:07:52       For from my life. So I'm a soda guy. So you drink soda? Yeah, that's my fix in the morning. So is that what you get your caffeine from? I mean like when you're doing a 33 hour run, like you must do some form of stimulant to stay awake. No. Ah, it, the adrenaline that gets going in you when you're winning the race, you know, you get, you get into the night, typically are bottling thousands starts at o'clock and you'll finish at two, three in the morning. For me, uh, if we're doing well, but about midnight when you start to get tired, usually realize you're in shit. You got a chance to win this race and the adrenaline kicks in and takes you right to the finish. It's when you're having a bad day, lots of troubles, and you're pulling a 36 hour event that and you're not capable of winning the race, the adrenaline goes away and then need to throw some sodas down to keep it going or, or some energy drinks.

Speaker 1:          01:08:39       Yeah, I would think that that would get really sketchy when you're dealing with like these crazy terms where you really have to be paying attention and you've been up for 25 hours. That must be where the real danger lies.

Speaker 4:          01:08:49       No, absolutely. And that's, you know, most likely Bud's earlier story with the candy bars from and, and Tracy Jordan, when they went off the cliff, I mean they just got in the car, but I believe they were in the car earlier that same day. Right? So they, the Baja peninsula, the race course, a thousand miles, the highways, 800 miles, most likely they'd got up in the morning and Ensonata did a couple stints in the race car got out, but they were traveling down the race course down the highway. And when they got back in and it was early hours of the morning and, and dusty, maybe foggy. And

Speaker 3:          01:09:18       Yeah, you can remember that every turn could end your race. Maybe it may be in your life if you're, if you're going too fast. But every turn. So for, for me, because obviously you can tell I have an issue with paying attention, I think. I can't think of anything else. And that's why I always ate quite at the cage fighting. If you get in the cage, you start thinking about your bills and your check and you know, they've got this happen and all the bullshit you're gonna get your ass kicked. Same thing down here. The only thing you have to really worry about is you're looking at brush or looking at dust. You're looking at power lines, looking at all that. You're reading the terrain and that's all the consumes your mind because if you don't, you're fuck

Speaker 1:          01:09:52       yeah. That's a thing that people need, right? Like I find that I gravitate towards things that require my full completed tension in the moment, whether it's, uh, going to the rifle range and shooting a rifle. You know, like I, I took, um, my friend Duncan and Chris yesterday, we went to the rifle range and it's one of the things that Duncan was saying, like when you're shooting, you don't think about anything else. Like the moment you're pulling that trigger, your mind is free of all the other nonsense you got going on in your life. Your mind is just concentrating on keeping the radical, keeping that crosshair on that target, calming your nerves and then squeezing that trigger and not moving anything else. What is it about us that we need? Things like that. Is it the over complex society that we live in?

Speaker 3:          01:10:37       I think so. I think, you know there's it with my business, your business and all elevated. We're doing, there's text messages and there's fucking Facebook and Twitter and you've got to all this bullshit and there's so much stuff in there. And the thing that I think is different, much different than rifles, like there's consequences of what we do because if we don't, if you miss the shot, oh Ho hum. I missed the shot. I'm not running down rifle. You don't shoot me. But yeah, but in what we do, if you, and I've done it before, I'm like, I, you kind of get into a law like driving in a snowstorm. You see the snow storm coming out and you kind of get drive. You kind of drive yourself, do a little bit of sleep, turn comes up, you're going to go off a cliff, you're going to wreck your, someone's going to hit you from behind you. You know that the,

Speaker 5:          01:11:14       the worst it's death need the very easiest as you broke your car and you gotta get, you gotta get out there and fix it and you just let your team down. There are teams, he's got 60 70 people that are on his team and then they all worked really hard to get him down there and that pressure's on him not to fuck up, but is a weird that we as human beings have this strange desire to chase danger like that, that like that, that managing danger becomes sort of like a drug fix. We're getting, well, you're, you're a lot deeper human being than I am, but this is, this goes back to the primal human. We used to go on hunts, right as, as guys, we used to go and hunt. We used to like, you stay here, I'm going to go on a hunt and I'm going to chase bear and going to kill the buffalo.

Speaker 5:          01:11:55       I'm going to go on the, I'm going to go to war, I'm going to do these things and yeah, I don't, I don't know what it is. You get to a certain part of your life and you've got to start chasing that. You have to have it. Like I don't need to raise, I'd have to race. Well, I think there's certain human reward systems that are set up in our minds and essentially in our DNA and that we don't fulfill them at all with the average, the average everyday cubicle life traffic, cubicle come home television. The news bombards you with fucking nonsense from all around the world. And then you go to sleep and start all over again and you're missing a lot of shit. And then something comes along like this race where like, you know, if are you fucking jumping around this crazy fucking truck, you're going 140 miles an hour and your body's like, yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:12:40       finally, something's happening. Yeah. It's addiction for me. Absolutely. I mean, when I'm not racing, last year I reached 35 weekends. I, it took the green flag fucking hat most of the year. I think I took the green flag over 80 times and every time basically I started a race. I started race, they threw a green flag. So I raced over 80 times last year in 35 weekends. Some of these times I take four green flags. Actually one weekend last year I took seven green flags over the weekend racing in three different trucks. Um, discussed her, there's multiple classes and the short course races, there's multiple classes. So I'm addicted it so much. I go get in any vehicle I can go race. So I reached seven times. But when there's, when there's, when I have a weekend off, I don't know what to do with myself. So I think I need that adrenaline rush. I need to race, I need to get a checkered flag, I need to win. That's really what my life is about. Becoming a part of me. Absolutely.

Speaker 5:          01:13:39       And Bud, you've been, she'd been chasing stuff like that all as long as I've known you, you're always like trying to do some crazy like charged up thing. It builds your character. I think he's the guy you build to helps you build your character. And I'm, I'm, I'm addicted to drugs. My drug is a Dorfman's and adrenaline and I have to have that. I think it was, um, I forgot who said it might've been Rhys Millen or someone like that, but they said in, in, in normal life you had the guy in the cubicle sit in New York City, he may have like one close call on in his whole entire life

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       or maybe one a year down in Mexico you have nine or 10 in a race. You, I mean, you are close to death a few times. I mean, Holy Shit. Oh fuck. I'm glad that didn't happen. And you do that for over and over and it's, it's, it's scary for, you know. Definitely. I've, you know, I've tried, I did a movie in the raptor, I don't know if you saw it.

Speaker 1:          01:14:30       No, I never saw that. When you do, you did that, like you, you produced a film about the Ford Raptor, like right when it was coming out. Is that what it was? Was the launch, the launch of that was a launching

Speaker 3:          01:14:40       oh eight. And um, I, my wife, there was two movies back to back. I did. And there was one time we got stuck all the guests and I got stuck. You remember the scene? And I, I took a tow a tow strap, pulled it to the front of the thing, walked across and hook it to my friend's truck and uh, some idiot and the trophy truck wasn't me. Ran over my strap like right where I was. Whoa. I mean, cause you know, you're, you're in this blinding silt bed. I don't think. He did not try to kill me. He's blinding silt bed. He knows if he slows down, he just sees a whole, there's a truck and there's a guy, I'm going to go right between it. And I'm like, oh my God, talk. That was very close, really close. So I, that was the scene in our movie and my wife is like, ah, yeah, you're not doing that anymore.

Speaker 3:          01:15:23       It's quite often she saw it. Oh Wow. My wife, one last story. He says, my wife in 2012 when I won my race, I called my wife. I, it's, I'm excited. I won one race. Rob's run 220 races more than anybody in the planet. I won one race. I called my wife at five o'clock. I said, honey, we want, I've been chased it for nine years. She said, good, you can quit, and she hung up on me. I got no, I got no play at all. I'm like, I'm so excited. Like I can't, I want to call my mom. I went to call my wife. I wanted to like, Hey, guess what? I did this. He's like, yeah, that's nice. You can quit now.

Speaker 1:          01:15:56       Yeah. It's hard for some people to relate to that need to be charged up and do nutty things like that, right? Yeah, I think so. I mean for me it's all about winning championships, winning races and uh, can't get enough of it. Well so many people trying to, they've tried to live their life safe, you know, they tried to do just the opposite. They're like looking for the softest cushion to sit on there looking for the easiest job. They're looking for the longest amount of time off to looking for the, this to the cushiest existence. No that's not living. You got to get out there and experience life. You got to live it. Yeah I agree. But I mean there's that, there's like these two schools of thought when it comes to people. There's people that try to seek out adventure and thrills and have all these wild experiences in their life and there's people that have zero desire.

Speaker 3:          01:16:52       See Joe and I have it. We have a disease. We have like a dinner party or disease or that we share. Like I, I can't talk to those people. Right. Cause I, I seek out, like I, I do deep sea dives on shipwrecks and I'll try to go to this. Not because I think I'm a bad ass shit. Cause I'm pushing myself, I always want to push myself. I have to do something to

Speaker 4:          01:17:10       train for it. So when I go talk to people like regular people or people that are boring as shit, I sound like an idiot and I had nothing to say to them cause you, you, you try to do what we just did here in Rob's got a million of them. You try to tell them an adventure story in Baja. Like I hit a jump at 120 and I jumped this or accidentally hit this guy on a bike and the like, they think you're crazy. Yeah. There's certain people that it's just, it's too, it's too time consuming trying to explain your motivations behind certain things. Like I try to think of like, what's the least thrilling thing that I do that I could sort of tell people that I do? Like what do you, what do you, what do you do for a living? Uh, do a radio show on the Internet.

Speaker 4:          01:17:48       Like as I say that, like a leave out the UFC, I'll leave out standup comedy. Like, I don't want this, just this ain't the, the bridge between us. It's too far. There's no, there's no room there. Some folks just, they don't want any thrills. They want no thrills. They want no, nothing dangerous. They want to see everything to be spelled out for them. They want, you know, two weeks paid vacation and they want to make sure that they could retire when they're 65 and they're already ready to die. Like they've got it all set up. You betcha. You betcha. Yeah. So, well, what's, what's the best story for Baja? Cause I told my crazy story, but you have the, you have better stories. You've been well, you know, actually I think I'm, I've been honestly fortunate enough when I started going to Baja, I went with Walker Evans and, and people that have tons of experience down there and they kind of help minimize those stories for me.

Speaker 4:          01:18:37       Um, you know, one of the early days racing class, one single buggy single seat or only one person in there down there after San Javier. Well, you're talking about earlier, he had a flat tire and uh, got out to change that tire and had a, you know, the motors running in the buggy and, and you can't hear anybody around you. There's typically, there's no, I thought it was in the middle of nowhere and all of a sudden say somebody came up, tapped me on the back of the shoulders, scare this crap out of me. Um, things like that. I, I don't, you know, crashing, uh, I've done multiple crashes all over the place, Wad and stuff up. I'm breaking my collarbone. Um, the crazy stories I guess, you know, I, I, I don't have the wild ones. The reason why is I think that I, you know, I go down there prepared, I'm there to win.

Speaker 4:          01:19:20       Um, you know, I try to really minimize all that stuff and haven't had a hottest crazy stuff happened. Did you get involved in other motor sports first? Will you involve regular racing first? Yeah, I started racing motorcycles when I was eight, nine, 10 years old. They got this Christ Yak racing motorcycles is an eight year old. Got Involved in doing that. And you know, my dad was involved in do an off road racing and the early seventies when I was on motorcycles. And then when I got turned 16 years old, we got an interracial and buggies doing the mint 400 stuff like that. And you know, I quit my senior year of basketball is the dumbest thing I ever did. I should've played it through, but I fell in love with off road racing and then, uh, you know, just made it, made it my hobby there for a few years and then, and got lucky enough to get picked up by, uh, people like Ford Motor Company, BF Goodrich tires.

Speaker 4:          01:20:03       And I ended up making a career out of it. So, um, I've been doing, uh, doing this for a living for over 20 years and, and like Bud said, we've won over 200 races on BF Goodrich tires. I'm actually about 280 total wins and off road since 80 to over 20 championships. And if you had to stop and you had to go and live and office job, like if someone came along and BF Goodrich said, look, we're taking you out of the fucking heat. It's just, it's too crazy. We're going to give you a nice cushy job. Stop six figure salary. Nice House. Yeah. At this point, I can't even imagine that, you know, I think about that, you know, every once in a what a, what am I going to do when this is over and I don't know. I don't even know what I'm going to do, but, you know, hopefully go to work with somebody like BF Goodrich or, um, you know, my family owns a, an offer buggy shop in Vegas doing stuff like that.

Speaker 4:          01:20:50       But um, you know, I don't plan on quitting anytime soon. It's what I know. And you know, it's, it's almost all I know. I mean, I have, it's my hobby. It's my job. It's my life. Who's the oldest guy that can do it? You were saying that that Newman did it when he was 80. He did. He do. He did a race when he was 80. What a fucking animal he was and I haven't met Stuart did it. I mean he did it until in his sixties Walker Evans, Larry Ragland some of the best of the sport, you know, had their most success in their, their 50s which I haven't got there yet so I'm hoping to calm down. You calm down. You did. There's a thing in our race racing called red mist. Read Miss will get you hurt. Like Jesse James goes down there all the time and generally wads it up in the first hundred miles compensated by Jesse James because he just goes crazy.

Speaker 4:          01:21:31       No, because people misunderstand the race. I mean he knows more about the races. I bet they misunderstand the race that they think in the first hundred miles. I got to beat everybody. The analogy that I have is when they put their helmet on, they throw their brains out the window and, and I did that when I was young. Crash. A lot of stuff ruined, ruined cars. But over time you learn. That's not how you win the race. You basically go as slow as you possibly can to win. You have to keep an eye on your competition. You go through the pitch, get split times, find out how you're doing, but as long as you're, you know, you're close to winning the race, you're doing a good job. When you get down to the end, that's typical only you and a couple of the guys that are racing for the win, all those other 2030 guys in your class there, they're broke or they're having problems.

Speaker 4:          01:22:15       How many people are racing like when, when they say ready, set, go. How many people fucking hundred 50 and all the classes? 150 to 350 depends on which way is like the thousands. Like 300 to 350 people. So there was vehicles. Yeah. So 350 vehicles all together. Bob, how does it, how does it set, I mean how many lanes are you're dealing with here when they start the race, when the, when they start the race, they send one one truck or one buggy at a time, usually every 30 seconds apart. Racing the clock. We're out racing on the track at the same time. You do have to come up and bump those guys, move out of your way if they're slower than in front of you. But, um, you know, we're racing the clock and as you get down the course, the bike start, usually the bikes, the quads and Utvs they started about three hours in front of the, the first four wheel vehicle.

Speaker 4:          01:23:05       But we ended up catching those guys. And that's where it becomes really sketchy. And sometimes were these, you know, bud story earlier when, when, when Josh and Josh at the bike guys, because the bikes can't do certain things. Well some of them can do. Yeah, some of them can. Um, but a lot of the, especially in Mexico, a lot of the bike guys are or sportsmen's. Um, and when you're doing a long race, like the Baja 1000, um, it becomes more, uh, the bike guys. You know they get used up quicker and the trucks, you're sitting in the seat, you know you don't have air conditioner but you've got, you know you can have snacks, you can have food, you can have water as you're racing down the course of the bike guy. It's just him and a small light. You know I talked earlier about how the lights on our trucks are like a stadium.

Speaker 4:          01:23:46       They have one light, we have 14 to 20 lights on our trucks. It's a lot different and fuck that must be scary. Driving a motorcycle fast. They think of baseball stadiums behind them sometimes I hear at trophy truck behind him. Some of the guys, the smart ones, oh they freak out. They look behind them like Ooh Shit. And they'd get off the road and the trophic go to blowing by him cause they don't want to get run over. I mean there's a lot there. A lot of accidents with the bike guys and they're there. I score is doing a lot of things to to mitigate that at this point they're starting them later. We're going to start it the night before and stuff like that. For me, there's an interesting thing for me. I was going to tell you, like I'm known, you know me for a long, long time, I've known kindly like kind of a crazy jackass.

Speaker 4:          01:24:22       It doesn't do this when I'm going down the races. You, you talked about the catheters. There's an interesting to happens to me and my psyche. I'm wearing a fire suit. I have my catheters on, I have a fireproof underwear. I put my helmet on, I got my knife in my pocket so I can cut my seat belts off. Anything else happens. I started doing all this stuff. I'm like, Holy Shit, I'm doing something pretty serious. And I calmed down. I have problems with my sponsors who hang out with me and they're like, you're, you're going to fucking wreck. You're a crazy wacky idiot who's gonna wreck the car. So they don't, they, they're not managing this craziness. Well, what do you mean? It is? Like some people just don't, some people just can't like look at all the different variables. Look with all the craziness and just settle in.

Speaker 4:          01:25:06       Okay, this is what we're doing now. Yeah. Some people, and it's hard to read. Miss comes in like you your son. And I've get, I get caught up sometimes too, cause I had a guy pull behind me one time, a French guy until he's gonna kick my ass if I don't move. I said we'll stop the car. I'll stop the car, get out and I don't care. We'll stop right in the middle of quarter. You're going to kick my ass. Fucking French. French. They gave us these fries and now they got at Delta my way. I'll kick your ass. That's what he's saying on the radio. I'm like, fuck you out of the way. I'll kick your ass and I know what he's doing. He's freaking how out and he's in this race and you just got to pace yourself. You get to be calm. It's hard not to get caught up in the beginning when guys are banging on you like they're hitting you. I don't understand. You don't, some people hit hard. They need Roman to, you could try to get you out of the way. Yeah, it just, they don't even care. Then it'll honk. You just drive also, boom. Being rear ended the four or five at 60 miles an hour. You're like, Holy Shit. Yeah. The off road trucks or one lane, it's not like five lanes on the four oh five

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       it's one lane. So to past that guy, you come up there, you hope he moves out of the way typically doesn't really want to. So you got to come up there and bump them and sometimes people get out of control and they hit you really hard. They try to move you off the track. Especially if it's a jackass like these guys who've actually had a bad day. So this is what I, the problem I have. Right? So they've had a bit, I'm having a good day. Right? So I'm in front of my class. He's had a bad day and a trophy truck. He's got 900 horsepower, 105 gallons of fuel. He's fucking pissed off. He's tired, he's not happy anymore. And he's trying to make up time. And then there's, me and my buggy are going to want to deal with these slow guys. We want to get to the, we want to get done, we want to get to the finish line.

Speaker 3:          01:26:41       And the dust that he's kicking up makes the trophy truck guy pissed off and it's like you don't deserve to be here. Get Out of my way. And by the time you get to them, you give them a little low. A little low. That's the bump. That's the bump. Oh yeah. And how many guys get fucked up because of that? I mean it seems like that would be one of the reasons why a lot of guys wreck, well, a lot of the cars there, they're built to take that. It's, it's in the DNA of off road. That's, that's Kinda how we pass. You come up there, you bump into each other tagging. That's your, you know, your, I caught you. Now you move out of the way. Let me go buy it. That's what we do. So you guys use, there were chromoly tubing into chromoly tubing designed to take a good impact, but you, you would pull over the side. Yeah, exactly. Like a 1950s dad, get rid of you. If you were in the accident, if you were on the forum, if someone hit you that hard, you pull over and call the cops and grabbed your neck and go, whoa. That was an impact. Oh yeah. Part of the game as part of the game.

Speaker 1:          01:27:38       Wow. That's crazy. That's, it seems so bizarre. That's, he just seems so crazy that part of it is just ramming into you while you're going, you know, x amount of miles an hour. Right? It's normal. It's not normal. It's normal in that world, in that world, it's normal. We were fucking human beings are so crazy in that way. We just find normalcy in the fact that, well, this is what happens when you do this. And then all rules, all decor, all normal rules of behavior go out the window when you're racing in a Baja and you're pissing through your fucking can

Speaker 3:          01:28:13       shoe. And well, I think there's, there's, if there's a very weird, I get some something in the psych. I can tell you from me once, once you figured this out and you've done the organization and you've gone to your catheter, to your knife, you got your chase team, you've got your feel. Once you've organized successful race campaign like he has, then wreck regular life and business. It's not that hard, right? You actually, you get out of a race and he's like, then then actually you sometimes get a little short with stupid people and you're like, really? You just had to go to the store and pick up a six pack and come back was that, that's fucking hard and cause what we do, there's so many consequences. He can tell a guy and this is actually how it goes to. It's like I need you to go to the [inaudible] station, which is the gas station in Mexico.

Speaker 3:          01:28:54       Be there at one o'clock with some extra tires. Got May need when I get out and that's what you tell the guy and it's 800 miles away and you don't see that guy until 800 motel, you know for 12 hours from there and that guy is sitting there. It is logistics crazy and you surround yourself with the people who know have a common goal. Your logistics are all point out. I mean if you need anything down there, you know where it's at and you come back to the states and you can't you and like you know some of your employees or someone like that can handle like two simple instructions or like that guy would die down in Mexico. Well it's just the

Speaker 1:          01:29:25       stakes are higher, the pressure's higher and everyone's tuned in. Everyone's tuned in. Everyone has a goal.

Speaker 4:          01:29:33       Yeah. You want to surround yourself with the people who've been down there to Mexico. It's two lane highways. Very dangerous. There's not streetlights very rarely. There's yellow line dividing the center lane and you got, you got to have the right people. It's, it's a very dangerous things to legit. It is. It's a logistics nightmare to to plan out a race. I always say to people, if I, if I would spend as much effort that I do off road racing and putting the team together and the logistics in a regular business, I'd have a lot of money. Instead I race the trophy truck and I don't have much money.

Speaker 3:          01:30:04       Oh yeah, no, this makes ups look like, I dunno, this is look real logistics.

Speaker 1:          01:30:08       Yeah, but would it be any more exciting? I mean, a lot of money would, wouldn't be worth it. And I like this is a lot of people that have a lot of money that we know they're just miserable as fuck. They're all on antidepressants and they're, they're always constantly in and out of relationships in their life is a fucking holy rack of failure and catastrophe. But they're financially successful

Speaker 3:          01:30:31       because they're not challenging themselves and they're getting, it has to do with challenging yourself.

Speaker 1:          01:30:34       Yeah, I think you're right. I think there's something about being uncomfortable that provides you with a certain sense of wellbeing. I don't, I don't know what it is, but yeah, I was hunting in Montana last year and, uh, we were talking about employees doing things and this, uh, the show mediator has these guys at work for it. I mean, I don't know what they get paid, but I'm sure they don't get paid much. And these guys are working 24 hours a day for the six, seven days that we're there. They're sleeping on the ground. It's fucking zero degrees outside there huddled up and sleeping bag. They get up before everybody else because they have to start the coffee, they have to fire up the, uh, the campfire and, and you know, have a job where someone doesn't want to fucking clean the restroom. Someone does want to take out the garbage and normal job where you, you show up at nine and you leave at five and try getting people to work throughout the day for what this guy gets paid to be 24 hours a day in Montana, sleeping on the ground, freezing their dick. But that's what he's doing. Like that's what he's doing. And in that world in, you know, he becomes a part of that production. Like this is what I'm doing now and this guy that you're calling and saying, hey, you know, go 800 miles, get some fucking tires, meet us there. Like that's what that guy's doing. And he's there and he's there.

Speaker 3:          01:31:57       Yeah, and you sit, I mean production like year, I have a group and we did the F-150 thing, they called it my production guys. Like you've been around production for awhile. My guys were up for 54 hours straight and they call themselves to 54 our crew. Right. Because they had the, we filmed this whole special for ESPN and then they were filling my whole special for Ford and they were up for 54 hours, not a complaint. They didn't like hit me for overtime. They're like, that was amazing and you've just got to surround you and I don't care about the overtime. You've got to surround yourself with people. Like I didn't know my race is going to be that effing long. I mean, we just happened to be, you know, we took 42 hours to do it. These guys do it and 19 or something like that.

Speaker 3:          01:32:33       But you, you surround yourself with those people. And I was going to say something about our support staff is, you know, our chase crews are amazing because we have volunteers like my brother comes out every year. It's something my brother and I can do now. They're chase crews are amazing cause most of them are volunteers. They're going to come down there. They'll drive and dangerous roads. They'll, they won't sleep at night. They'll be up for 36 hours and they eat beef jerky and it's cold as shit and they are always there. It's miserable. They hate it while it's happening. But in the end you're, you get home, you get rested up and you, all the great stories come out and you love it. You want to go back and do it again.

Speaker 1:          01:33:06       Yup. It's that, just that different level of life. It's like when you're out there doing the race, you're out there doing some wild, crazy shit like that. It's like everything's elevated. You're more tuned in, you're, you're more aware of your surroundings. You're not inundated by cell phones and text messages and emails.

Speaker 3:          01:33:27       They don't even work. Actually we, I have one phone and maybe a sat phone. I don't even return it. I'm like, I'm gone. Yeah. Once you go to Mexico, you call going to Mexico. Yup. He down there, see when I get home.

Speaker 1:          01:33:36       And that's part of it too, right? Part of it too is like the disconnect, unplug, unplugging and then, you know, recharging your brain and being out there and the desolate surroundings go on 140 miles an hour over bumps.

Speaker 3:          01:33:49       Well, it gives you, there's another side of it too that gives you appreciation. Not, you know, I have, I have a kid now, but I know my, my brother sends it to you. See, you don't know. You also see the people, how they live there. Our kids, amazing kids and they live in, um, chicken coops, right? The blue chicken coop down by a, um, a hose. They live in chicken coops. And I'm not kidding, I'm saying it's a blue chicken coop. That's what it is. And there's kids and I actually called, this is my, my own little story, but I, there's, there's, there's um, the kids that never grew up always come out of Ohio. So there's this little road after you turned down to blue date, the Blue Gate on the right hand side, there's a blue chicken coop and it looks like every year for 10 years the same kids come out.

Speaker 3:          01:34:26       They never get older, they don't have shoes. They're smiling. We hand up stickers. I stopped him, give him, I give him candy, I talked to him, he signs autographs, you take pictures, you go back the next year they look the same age and they, and they live. Joe, I'm telling you chicken coop, I can draw it for you, right? It's, it's a fucking chicken coop and it looks like it's, it's a chicken coop, but it's not funny. But you appreciate, you come back and sometimes you look at your kids and other people, kids make, you have no idea how he's your habit. Yeah. And then sometimes the kid, the chicken people go to the dump and that's where they find metal and they find scrap and they take the aluminum cans and they get their money and they're happy to, they're happy. They don't, they're not negative, they're not pissed off there.

Speaker 3:          01:35:05       They have no shoes and, and you know the Baja racers do a lot for the community down there. I mean sometimes they'll, they'll, they'll build orphanages. I mean a lot of the Baja guys get touched by what happens down there and the people down there and they go give back cause it you can't help but you know, you can't help but go to these. It's a third world country a lot, a lot of ways, not cabo and stuff like that. But the places where we go and you, you get affected by it. You get to see the other world and you do appreciate what we have. Our kids will never appreciate it cause you know, the 500 shoes, these kids have no shoes. Seriously. No shoes in the live in chicken coops with a, a sheet on the front

Speaker 1:          01:35:41       door. Yeah. I've been, I've driven in New Mexico, a POW pass Tiawana. I'm into some really sketchy areas. And you get to see these people that are living in these houses that are essentially like cardboard boxes with no windows. And you know, you see these small villages of places like that and it really puts it into perspective. And even more weird that that's connected to the United States. It's just one of the richest countries on earth. It's just you just drive. It's like same landmass. Yep. Just keep going. And he'd go from southern California with the fucking Kardashians live and you see a Rolls Royce in your neighborhood and then a couple hours drive, and then all of a sudden you're in a third world country where no one has shoes and was an advantage.

Speaker 3:          01:36:27       You'd go through, you'd go through the gate of Teal on, you take a right and you go up this hill and it is a marsh. So you're in Tijuana and you're right, you have the cardboard boxes and you look off to your right and there's a $20 million beach house sitting there and you can see it. Imagine waking up every day. You're up on this hill and Tiawana no running water. Everything's happened. You look up, there's a $20 million beach house.

Speaker 1:          01:36:47       Dang boy. He puts his, a Mexican, no states. Yeah. Yeah. So you can see San Diego. Yeah. You call up on this hill, you can see, say, look off to the right there. San Diego in 20 there. It's right there. Yeah. That is fucking bananas. La Jolla. Like those houses in La Jolla. We should do the comedy store. And we, you know, look at La Jolla. I mean, they have palaces. These palaces overlooking the ocean and the most incredible affluent community. Everyone's driving around these expensive European cars. And you're 20 minutes away from Tijuana. Yup. 20 minutes. That's fucking crazy. That's like from here driving a van eyes, you know, and, but except you're driving to one of the worst spots, one of the worst border towns. Yup. On Earth. But the people are amazing. The people help us. They do so much for, so it's pretty fucking bad ass to Mexican fucking throw down. Tacos, shrimp, everything. Lobster, lobster, tacos. Where's the lofts? Tacos at a lots of Tacos. I forgot what it was at Mama's Mama's Tom Espinosas. Mama Espinosa had lofts. Your tacos are amazing now. You never get to stop that music a car.

Speaker 5:          01:37:56       Now do any, um, Mexicans race. Absolutely. There's a lot of people that live in Mexico. The join in on this. Yup. Have you ever want it? Oh yeah, no, it actually did a very, a Taco villa dosa one. He's a part of the Red Bull Team on the 50th anniversary. I'm sorry, it wasn't, it was the Mexican independence. Yep. That was him and his father. Um, Gus wanted, and they're, they're, they, they're from, they're from Tijuana. They're from that area. Um, and there's also one, Carlos Lopez is a lot of Mexican teams. I mean Lexican teams get a little resources. They go race. And by the way, they are definitely race trophy trucks, which they do. There's a couple of trophy truck teams, but they'll race Volkswagen's, they'll race everything you could possibly get. So you were talking about the French guy, they wanted to kick your ass. Is that a guy from France that came over just to race in this?

Speaker 5:          01:38:38       Yeah, there's about, there's usually guys from 150 countries. People from all over the world come. Japanese guys come down there. All that means is everybody all over the world come to Baja. 1000. It's that much of a spectacle. You, you have to be, I don't live in a cave for 800 years, not to hear the ball went thousand. Wow. And then people from all over the world come. Yeah. Because I've seen like in Europe, I know they do a lot of rally car races and they use Porsha's like Porsche has a lot of rally cars. They drive on dirt roads. Yeah. But did they have this kind of thing as well? And other countries? Yeah. No rallies pig everywhere. Like this kind of rally like this kinda like crazy modified truck. A Dad Day to dat car, which is a little, a little bit different races as a stage race.

Speaker 5:          01:39:22       That car used to was um, really from Paris did a car, it was Perry to car was the name of it. And now that's in South America through Brazil and Argentina and Chile. Have you raced that car yet? No. Yeah, there's no cars. Famous race. I mean it's a very famous race and we score Raj and I've been talking to Saudis to try to bring your race over there. We've met with China. Roger met with China to try to bring in race over there. Um, we were going to try to expand what score is going to do and try to bring it to other countries. I would think it would be a no brainer for like Saudi Arabia or any of those places where I was rich oil people love to do crazy shit like drift cars. Yup. Like you've seen those videos. So it's drifting videos.

Speaker 5:          01:39:58       Oh yeah. From Arab countries. Dubai's real big right now on the sand buggies. You need to get them into off road at will Rogers talking to me and we can get, we can get him over there. They have an f one race, you know the, yeah. Obviously idea is getting all, you know, get all the trophy truck teams come over there. But I'm on a ship getting everybody there and go race. Yeah. What's the sand buggies like? Uh, it's a lot lighter buggy than what we raced in off road and they basically just go to the sand dunes there. Specific built for sand dunes and they have thousand horsepower. They do wheelies up the hill, down the hill and over in Dubai. I guess that's a big thing going on right now. A lot of the recreational, not racist, just recreation. Just having fun. What is it about people that, you know, like the moment someone invented cars, look at it.

Speaker 5:          01:40:42       These guys are drifting. Why is that exciting to go sideways, by the way? I have no idea. The feeling of being out of control because guiding the most people. I haven't had a control. That's an open freeway almost. Yeah know it looks like it is it that doesn't seem like a smart move. Well, I've seen some fucking horrific crashes to oh yeah. I've seen some of those uh, Arab drifting crashes or cars or flipping and bodies are flying out. But the moment like people invented cars, like how long before the moment of car was invented before people decided to fucking race him when the second car was built, probably right. I'll promise you. When the second car was built, Henry Ford based the whole industry that our whole industry, the first auto race was in in Chicago, but our whole industry is based on auto racing.

Speaker 5:          01:41:26       It's, it's theirs. It's even goes past the 60s it's back when Henry Ford that he raced Henry Ford raised Duesenberg raced all these guys, raced it, prove out Edelbrock who's a aftermarket guy, but he raised, they all, the thing in our industry is, you know, race on Sunday, sell on Monday, so I'm going to go out. Ford built his cars like I'm going to go out and win this race. Indianapolis 500 was based on manufacturers racing. Who's got the fastest car? I had a conversation with someone about that once, whether we're talking about planned obsolescence, like planned like that. There's certain technology that's available today that you're not going to see in cell phones or televisions because they want it to be obsolete a year from now. And he was trying to make the argument about automobiles that they do that, that they can make the best car. Right? And I'm like, you're, you don't even know what the fuck you're talking about.

Speaker 5:          01:42:11       Because what they're doing right now is they're racing cars and then they developed that technology based on those race cars. And that trickles down into the consumer aftermarket cars or consumer cars. The corvette program is the number one to look at, right? So corvette is the longest, longest running sports car in America, long as bill isn't everyone out of production and their race program that the transfer of technology, I did a whole documentary series on corvette launching the c six and the whole thing was transfer technology. If they develop a, you know, you do the R and d, which is the hard part, right? Which is what rob does for his trucks and they start looking and poking around. You do in the Rd and your race and you make that c six corvette are, which is called [inaudible] that are now [inaudible] sweet corvette or they raced those teens.

Speaker 5:          01:42:54       Pratt and Miller builds them and then there is it. There is a Chevrolet engineer and I know them on the race team looking at stuff. Do you know checking Cambra, checking brakes, checking aerodynamics, checking everything and that technology transfers to your car, which is why corvette is still one of the most dominant cars out there for 70 grand. You can get it just because they, they invest in that technology and the new one is incredible and stingers pretty bad is an incredible car. It's beautiful looking. I saw one the other day, I thought it was a Ferrari. Same here. I told my son, I go, she got that Ferrari because that's a corvette. You're right. Sorry. It looks like, yeah, it looks like like a European like high end top end car and the Interior's nice now to finally they figured out a way to make a car that doesn't look like a piece of shit with a fucking impala steering wheel. I mean they used to have these dog shit interiors. Same thing. The Viper did we, I did document and reasonably I'm rebuilding the Viper Ralph Shields from uh, from SRT motors. He did the same thing.

Speaker 3:          01:43:52       They race, they learned stuff from racing. They put it in there. But the new new viper is amazing looking.

Speaker 1:          01:43:57       What's, what's a better car? The New Viper or the new corvette? Depends. The price points are much different for the money. The core of that has to be at the price point on the viper is 110,000, 115,000 to the core of it. You could take the roof off too. That's pretty dope. The core of that's pretty cool. Yeah. Look at that thing. I mean they fucking nailed it man. Yeah. But see all the, all the hood vents, all the, all the break ducks, all that stuff is all developed from racing. It's all functional. Yeah. It's not nonsense. It's not just something to look at, which, uh, you know, cars have had in the past. We were at a weird time right now in automobiles because there's so much power. Great time. Great time, but so much power in the cars you could buy on the showroom floor, like when they have a, the the Shelby gt 500 660 plus horsepower. Yep. Right at the walk from the showroom, pay the guy your money getting a car and you have a 660 plus horsepower car with a live rear axle and you're stomping on the high of Bois and it goes, it's the same zero to 60 in three seconds in a fucking car that you could just drive off the showroom floor.

Speaker 3:          01:45:05       And in the 60s he used to be, you know, 280 horsepower, 332 the boss came out as like go, it's got 320 horsepower. And I've, I've actually driven an old 302 and I actually test drove the new three Oh two and a test track at Ford. It's unbelievable. Parnelli Jones said the same thing. It's like if we are racing at Laguna Saker Parnelli and I was like, if I had that car it'd be easy.

Speaker 1:          01:45:27       Well, the new m three Oh two are you talking about the Laguna Saker one or the one that hasn't come out yet? Yeah, we are. We are [inaudible] and I were test driving the Laguna Seca. That's an incredible car. If the car got overlooked a lot by people, it did cause first of all, the stripes and everything. We're a little whack like the way they were painting it, but everybody wants the bigger engine. Everybody wants the, you know, the 550 horsepower shell, but now the 668 horsepower Shelby, but that 440 horsepower, Laguna Seca was the perfect balance front end to rear end. There it is right there. Yeah, it was suspension. That's the boss three o two right?

Speaker 3:          01:46:03       Yeah. That's the boss to go to. Yup. That's the boss or at two. And then you're talking about the goodness sake of with the red and he had the red lips, red rims,

Speaker 1:          01:46:10       the front error. I'm the front spoiler. The race spoiler with the pipes coming off of it, they just figured out a way to make cars that have horsepower. That would be a fucking super exotic car. Just 20 years ago, just 20 years ago, if you wanted to buy a car that had 400 horsepower, I mean you're spending a hundred grand, you're spending 150 grand, you know, you're buying, you know, the top of the line Porsche nine 11 turbo or something like that or crazy Lamborghini. Yeah, that's 300 grand. Now you're buying a fucking Mustang gt. Yep. I mean it's bizarre with bizarre time. It's

Speaker 5:          01:46:49       good, it's very good. But the amount of power and responsibility that comes with having one of these, he just handed off to some fucking 17 year old kid. Merry, merry Christmas. You little fuck. Here's your key. Well they've also improved. They've also improved. Um, breaks, breaks, trash control. Actually I, I have also, I have big issues with tracks, controls, stuff like that. Cause you do hand that guy 700 horsepower car and then he really, then you just, you really unfuck everything for him. Right. If he gets a little squirrely, the car fixes it for the car facility management and just actually breaking for you. You don't, you don't have throttle cables anymore. He got drive by wire and you can hit wide open throttle, but the drive by wire, the brain tells you no, no, no. You don't want full throttle cause you're just going to spin the tires.

Speaker 5:          01:47:32       I was racing at road Atlanta in a corvette, c six corvette and they have this turn 11 that comes off in your car, gets airborne, and every time I get airborne I had to land the card, shut off like, okay idiot, whatever you're doing, you've got to stop because that's not good. We're not supposed to have four. It would shut off. It would go into limp mode. Shut off I go, bird, go around the what if you had to fucking maneuver away from something? Well, the Angie would go into limp mode. It wouldn't. It would. It would go. It would shut down. I'd nailed the throttle. There's no throttle. It would go, it would go into four cylinder mode, limp mode, until I got halfway through the strait and we're going to go and I couldn't shut the damn thing off. That's retarded. Yeah, that's terrible.

Speaker 5:          01:48:08       But now they're, they're developing them with sport mode and other modes where you can do it. You can flip a switch to you on a lot of these so you can, well the other problem is, I don't know if this is true, but what people are really worried about is that someone is going to be able to have kill switches when they get shut your car off. Like remotely. Like say if you're running from the cops or something like that. They're doing already. They have Onstar, Onstar does that, you know, Onstar, you can shut your car off like that. Like Joe Rogan just told my Cadillac and even driving down the road, can you please shut it off being really? Yup. Can you pull that shit out? It can you unplug all that stuff? Probably. That's probably wired in. It's definitely wired in, but that's something you can't retroactively, you can't take like an old corvette sting ray like a 1970 sting ray and just take all those modern components and have the same sort of experience that you would have drive and a c seven corvette, but no Onstar, no nonsense.

Speaker 5:          01:49:07       I'm sure you could, can you, but you couldn't have the traction control, right? You couldn't, could you figure that out? A way to put a computer and have all that, there's enough, there's enough, you know, tuners are tutored and builders are amazing. They can have the traction control on it. Sure. Cause that's what a lot of people want to do now. Right? I mean that's another show that you're doing, right? The restaurant mods, rest of Mod, rest of mods or the thing where you take an old car and you put all new suspension, new components, that's very attractive to people. Tim Allen's going to, he's got a [inaudible] 69 Camaro and it's got all new c seven corvette, um, suspension wheels, everything in it, assemble it. You can look it up. It's his new, it's green. It's beautiful. You pop the hood, you know, like some stuff are you into cars.

Speaker 5:          01:49:44       You and I were looking at it. It's unbelievable. And he drives it around. Yeah. If you could drive it everywhere. Yeah. Drive it away. It starts like a corvette. You can start it from the [inaudible] six, nine. Camille just start it up. It's a cool car. What about the interior? Does it look like a new corvette or is it like an old school interior as well? Old School Interior. Wow. Pull that up, man. Lemme see this? Yeah. It's built by Bodie Straub built it. Okay. I've heard that name before, right? Yes. Yep. I've told you about it. Yeah. This is a video of it. Here is, that's it? Yup. Tim Allen and Jay Leno. Hey. Wow. Jay Leno's garage. Oh Wow. I mean, it really is a sleeper. Yeah, that's crazy. That's a corvette. Turn the volume of, let me hear what he says to say about this.

Speaker 7:          01:50:26       This one here belongs to a real car guy. Tim Allen. Tim, come on in, buddy. Shitty wheels, but introduction, I stock sucks. Comedian, actor, a bestselling author and cargo car guy. Yeah, movie star, but most of all cargo. This is a beautiful Camaro. You know, I'd been looking at it when it first pulled anyone, oh, it's 68 Camaro, but then I look and there's all these subtle little changes. Just the kinds of things that I like. The stock wheels are way wider rims. Tom? Sure. We'd used to race one of these on Woodward when I was a kid. Green. This car stock three 27th it's one of those things that was just a great bullet. It ran. It ran circles around any other car. I loved that car. Loved race with them. No console. It was the low end one, wasn't the SS, so I redid that and always like smokey Yunick the Trans am car that he made and every time I saw one, I think one of the elder Brock family has it now and I'd see it race in these classic car racing.

Speaker 7:          01:51:25       Wait, there's something about that car. Not the fact that he's trans and lower. He showed two inches off the rake up the hood, took off the drip rails, which I don't have on their natural flares, which they don't have. They're not all buttoned up. A lot of my time with the ball pin hammer j you know what I may think, think, think and then I decided in those days and Woodward days they had Coppos, which is what is your central office production order? You could put it on your order and if you did the right sequence, GM would put a truck motor into cars. We did that time was a four 27 and they put four 2017 and very few Camaro's and other wood, you know, 800 grand or something. But what that means is that GM did not want their big engine from the corvette and the Camaro to fall from the cell production.

Speaker 7:          01:52:18       You could, you could special order a car with the big engine and that's what these, and so I changed the name to that. That's the name of to four 27 Coppo that shows what we called it didn't, we did some great little name tags. All this kind of stuff is details that I like. Rally wheels that aren't wheels at all there. I mean it's not a wheel like the old days, he's disc brakes have to fit underneath. You've got to make them bigger. And I mean that's what I like. You know, I like it when someone does a period car. I hate it when they, all of a sudden they have 22 inch dubs on it. And it's right. It just doesn't look right. You know this town, you hit a pothole and I'm standing at the side of the road. I got to have a cause. I drive these things right and well, that's a beautiful looking. We all, I mean that's a custom wheel you cannot buy. That was made specifically for this vehicle. Number one, I really wanted black wheels with hubcaps. That's how coppos came. They didn't come with rally wheels. So I have a set of black wheels. I want bumpers. I put back on it all the trim went back and I stock mirrors right back on it. No console, none of that stuff. Well, that's what I love. It's really a beautiful, beautiful.

Speaker 5:          01:53:18       All right. See if you can get a video of the inside of it. I want to see what they did to the inside of it and she get images, but that's a, that's a trend that a lot of people are doing now because they want to have that beautiful old school muscle car and look, but they also want to have a car that that's the interior. No Way. That's a real interior. That's it. Recaro seats is the only thing is to be the interior of the car play. Press play. Let me hear what he has to say.

Speaker 5:          01:53:55       Yes, cause that's an image instead of the video. Why isn't why they did it, but that does interior. I've sat in their car. That's what it looks like he had. He put like an old stupid looking steering wheel and everything. It's a stock steering wheel. Everything stock interior, but it's not stock handling like the pinion and all that shit.
