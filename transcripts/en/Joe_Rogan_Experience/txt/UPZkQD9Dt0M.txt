Conan the barbarian type shit and throwing ropes around and lift in Canon balls with handles home. It's what I do for all my strength and conditioning. All I do is I do chin ups, I do body weight squats and I do a bunch of crazy exercises with kettle bells and it's fucking fantastic. It's the best I've ever found as far as things that translate directly to athletic activities. I don't think there's anything better than kettle bells. I think it's one of the most phenomenal ways to exercise in the world you're at.

Speaker 1:          00:00:50       You're supporting a, a big heavy ball of steel iron rather, and you're supporting them with your body and going through all these complicated motions. And it, what it does is it makes your body work as one unit instead of just doing bicep curls and shit like that. And it makes your body strong as one unit. So it works in a natural way when you have to use it for sports.

I thought that was right. Does that happen

Speaker 3:          00:02:59       trying to drink it? Is it a faulty one? Oh I didn't see them lifted. Yeah. Can everybody just be Starbucks? Why does it, it's like Cain gorgeous, isn't everything pumpkin. That was pretty easy. That's, that's sad. She's, she's now, you know why I got around? One of the things that I enjoy about being around you, man, I said life is theater 24 seven. I don't know why you say it's the end of the dressing room. It was, you're a fun fucking dude to be around and I've liked that about you. I've really learnt that about Yo cause we didn't know each other that well and now we've become what I would call friends. You'll have to look friend, not be honored text. We text all caps.

Speaker 3:          00:03:51       No, no, I have to do it that way or else I can't see what I'm doing. So it's not like you know how they say when you text, you can make the lord the font larger. I've, that's what I've had to do. I don't use that kind of phone. I don't use that. Oh, you don't use an iPhone? No. How dare you? I use commando. Commando. You could talk 300 feet under water with it. Oh, is it one of those Verizon ones? Crazy ones. So let's say you've got one for a disaster. You're having a fight with a guy, right? Right, right. And you were on the beach. Everyone into the water. I go underneath that could call the cops and say, I've got a problem over here.

Speaker 3:          00:04:29       I mean, what a fucking making phones to talk on the water. Got It. Yeah. I thought about going that way. I tried it in my pool. It's like I think of what do you want to, what kind of car do you like to drug? Do you draw like to drive a sports car or do you want to drive like a military Humvee? I mean you've got two different ways and looking at things. One is I'm going to just assume that these roads are going to be like this and then I can get around on him pretty easy and just [inaudible] it's fun. Or I can pretend that the shit could hit the fan and every moment and all of a sudden I'm driving through the fucking desert. That's what I like. Fine. Racketing eat to stay alive. I like an industrial trucks. I do one. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:05:11       Big fucking machine. Stay back. I got a challenge it too. But that to me is an industrial sports because you have one of the new ones. Yeah, that's what is the black stripe. They nailed that car. They really like replicated a seventies muscle car. They, they get it though. So listen dage throw me a favor here. Make like, um, the convertible version. Nothing. Nothing will be cooler than that. And convertible. Yeah. You think you're right? Yeah. Like the tutor convertible guy that that's going to do this already 10 years. I mean camair rod does it. They all, it's a fucking challenge at the top down. Yeah. What the fuck? Dodge. Really, what is that? Right? Every time

Speaker 4:          00:05:58       you open the Sunroof, you want to close it because the sun's now beating on you through this little fucking old, either one. It open and not open talking. When I'm done talking, you start to question, ask it when I'm done. 24, seven no, he's got to know how to, you know, keep them in line. Keeping in line the a, the four 27 corvette is the best American car available now. Have you seen that now? But to me that's too, I like a big muscle doom this. They took, uh, they finally took the Xeo six suspension and Xeo six engine and they put it in a convertible zero six was the fucking race car and that was, they took a regular corvette and then the zero six was 505 horsepower and fucking racing suspension, big fat, almost slick tires. It's the craziest car ever. And now they're making it as a convertible, which is the first time that cafe brand and the publicists, but publicists, he's got, he's got that does Corvettes are ridiculous. They're ridiculous. Call the band, but then it's getting out of it. That's the hard part. Well it's, you know, it's also a plastic car because everything is broken. Everything. Everything from disintegrating feet, shoulders, you know.

Speaker 4:          00:07:15       Well in a way that disintegrate. Well I think a mother or father time. Fuck it is. I know when I close my face every night going to open my hand. Wait, let it, it snaps. Doesn't you are wearing gloves though? No, no. It's even worse when there were no gloves on. Yeah, like the joints get stiff and then they got to like pop open. Did you really start wearing gloves because it's like this for three hours. Did you really start wearing gloves because too many people were shaking your hands? You were worried about like getting sick or, I don't mind shaking hands, I just can't take sweaty hand. Yeah. You know what I mean? So I invented a way to shake hands without actually touching skin to skin. No. Because you know a lot of people today, I mean look up me dressed, how sloppy they are with the genes that they look like.

Speaker 4:          00:08:03       They're going to take half a shit out of that page as the walking down the street with the flip flops, the hygiene with their hands, they probably get the fingers in that that Reyes crack half the time I scratch them and then using the keyboard. Right. You know what I'm talking about. I know. You know what I'm talking. Oh, I know what you're talking about. Shake a lot of hands. Well, so you're with me. When the in the disdain of people who wear their fucking pants buckled around their dick, it's sickening. There is a problem with that folks. That is just stupid and people have said, man, you're so wrong dude. You just fucking, you just talking shit about style. You're being silly. You know nothing sexy about it. It's not style. That is crazy pants. It's not lazy. It's insane. I know when I see a girl or a guy walking around like they took a dump in that pant. It's the last thing I want to talk to. Yeah, they are one. There's something

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       about it that just shows that all you have to do is get one charismatic person to do something and then every asshole wants to follow them. So must've been just one probably bad ass black dude out of prison to sag his pants and kept sagging his pants and then all of a sudden all these fucking dorks want to copy that guy and it's become like this thing and the belt buckle where they back up. They literally are buckling their belt over there. Dick like, you silly. Fuck. You can't even walk. What do you hobbling yourself? It's like, this is way worse than anybody could make fun of a woman doing by wearing high heels. Like at least a woman in high heels can kind of kick her shoes off if she has to run. You know what I mean? Those things aren't high to get off, but if you, if you're wearing your fucking belt, buckled around your deck, if somebody wants to beat your ass, you really don't have a whole lot of options.

Speaker 1:          00:09:43       You're going to get, you're gonna get your fucking ass kicked unless you want to fight naked by the time you get those pants off, that good is gonna beat the shit out of you. You can't even walk right up your last suit. Joey, Joey, Joey, Jay, my nickname field. Jay. Thank you. And we don't talk about with the j mean and by the way, I need to get a pair of sunglasses. The violence that the prescription though. Bad ass though. Those are, I don't give a fuck sunglasses and I don't, I know you don't. I don't. I know you don't. I don't. That's why you got those two classes of perfect for you Joe [inaudible] Spiderman. We will get, I'm glad. Let me just say, we went to see dice in Vegas and it is one of the rare times that I ever get a chance to go to see a show actually said you haven't sat down and watched the car showing you is, well it had been about a year in the last time was Norton before that.

Speaker 1:          00:10:34       Maybe I caught Louis C k two at the Improv. But you know to go out per on purpose. We're going to go to Si dice tonight. We're going to go see a show like on purpose and me and Norton and Bobby Kelly and Anthony [inaudible] and Sam Roberts and all my God that we have a good fucking time. It was so fun. It was, first of all, your assigned was fucking great. It was hilarious. You know, it was just perfect. Oldschool dice and I think Anthony said, he goes, he goes, it's beautiful. He's like, it's still dice, but it's new. Like it's like the same old dice.

Speaker 5:          00:11:08       Yeah, it's fresh material. Well, with this, we haven't gotten talking about the special yet, but my whole idea was, all right, I want to give them all this new generation stuff, technology all the way to the fucking pig. So they walk around with that. Plus he's at today. I wanted to give him all that newest stuff, but yet I want you to put some of the classic dice stuff that the newer fans don't know and pepper that and into the act. So that's why I think he enjoyed it because you want to watch and somebody that all of a sudden is about politics. You come to see somebody like myself, boy you, you know, we're a certain brands, so people expect that. And that's what I like doing. Yeah. You know what I mean? You know, I, you know all these comics today that are going to bullshit about, you know, one little thing

Speaker 4:          00:11:54       they might've sent on stage and then it's a media event. You know, it's like the one thing I will, I will let the media know is when my special is, I'm not thinking of them. I'm thinking of the people that really want to laugh from my brand to Yuma. I don't care how I say it. I don't give a fuck what I say to them. You know? And I'm not apologizing for a fucking word out of my mouth and I loved that. I now want to do, I loved that. I think it's one of the most important things in comedy is that there's someone like you that says that because from my personal opinion as a standup comedy fan, as a connoisseur of Standup, I never thought you'd got the credit that you deserved amongst comedians because there was a lot of backlash about your material where they were saying like, oh, it's sexist.

Speaker 4:          00:12:40       So, oh, it's homophobic and it is a legitimate style of comedy. You're saying ridiculous shit and it's fucking hilarious. And if you can't recognize that as an art form, that's your ignorant problem. It's not that the materials that it's, that's the funny shit to say. It gets fucked up. Gay Say something ridiculous if course, you know what I medically sound advice. I've had people walking out of my show welcome, you know, cause it in Vegas sometimes they calm certain people's Holly writers, whatever. So people have walked out that they didn't like that I said the word fag. They go, he calls gay people FHEG and it's like, what's the fucking difference? It's the point I'm making. Yeah. You know what I mean? You're not making it hurt. You know, point, you know, these are just different words to say. Do they have an alternative sex style?

Speaker 4:          00:13:32       Yeah, I don't give a fuck what they do. I don't care if they want to suck dick all the way to the fucking bus station. That's their choice. But if I'm doing a bit fake is the word I use. It works better for me than the word gay or queer or alternative fucking lifestyle. They suck Dick on each other and that's okay by me. I don't want to suck Dick. And if I date, I'm telling you right now and have a hundred Cox laying on my face right now because that's how much it, if I want it, cause that's how I am about girls. You know what I mean? I like pussy. It's who I am. You know? So, so if I'm saying a word like fig, I'm saying it because that's the word that works best than the act. Dumb Herrera had the best line ever about BNK goes, Joe, I wish I was gay just so I could come out.

Speaker 4:          00:14:18       That's how little I give a fuck. Is that fucking quit as Angela Delmarva area? He saw just silly man. Yeah. Who fucking cares style comedy. And I always hold thing about comics, like being on truck, you know, I went through it, I went through it in a big fucking way. I mean this guy, but you went through it in a time where there wasn't that many people doing it and you sticking to your guns and keeping your character the way you've always kept in the inner psychiatrist ship facades did it? No, no, but almost, you know, no, I've, I've done the therapist actually when my career took off, I went to a therapist in New York to see how to handle my family because they got so, you know, because it happened so quick, you know, from the clubs to the arena thing that, you know, my parents and my, my whole family was so excited.

Speaker 4:          00:15:12       It's all they talk about. So I would be like, look, I know what I'm doing but let's talk about other things. You know, I didn't want it to be 24 seven about me. You know, when I'm on stage, when I'm working on projects, I do think constantly of what I'm doing. But when it's downtime, like when we came back, I just got done shooting a half the woody Allen movie that I'm doing. And so the other night Max is, you know, it was sitting outside in the front porch and he goes, was sitting with my wife Valerie, and he goes, let's put on the uh, you know, the video camera, what we filmed. And I said, you know what, now's not the time. I need a few days just to be myself now. I don't want to just stay on the movie and watch everything and see me more.

Speaker 4:          00:15:52       It's like, you know, just staying grounded in what's the most important thing. Well, to me that's the whole thing with fame. That's why a lot of these guys go nuts because it's 24, seven of them. So it's going to drive you nuts if you're not grounded. Like I won't even live in the hills. I need to see people, I need to be like more on the street, like if I was in Brooklyn, right. Because when you make you, when you isolate yourself, you know it, it just makes you just think of you and like, yeah, look at my house, look at my yard, but I don't see any people. Right. And that's no good for me. I got always feel people. Yeah. And that's also where you come up with material, cause I hate most people around them is to, so you, you are around people because you hate most people.

Speaker 4:          00:16:35       Well I like, I hate, you know what I mean about, you know when you get in traffic and you just make a move and they look at you like they own the fucking street. Well you know, you know if you had to Starbucks and you take too long to order a fucking coffee, they're looking at you like, doesn't he know the fucking menu that I want to fucking club them to death? You know what I mean? Like gimme the 30 so why do I feel panicked? You know, even at an airport, why do you have to feel panicked to put your fucking shoes in a basket that somebody is looking like doesn't he know the routine? Why do I got to rush every fucking move? But that's where our material comes from. And then on stage I blow it out comedically. But in real life, like I said, you want a club day ahead through to fucking feet, but you like being around them.

Speaker 4:          00:17:21       You gotta be around them, you gotta be around them to live life. Yeah, you have to do definitely do a certain amount of it. But I, I definitely need decompression too. You know when I light a cigarette is Starbucks and I'm sitting outside and they stopped fucking coughing. You know, they're stock quote. You ever get up in la about six in the morning where you can't see the fucking sky because the fucking dirty smog. It's feet above your fucking hedge. True. But my cigarettes, the one knocking you out. Golf. Fuck yourselves outside the fuck. Anybody that don't like my cigarette, fuck you. And the horse you fucking wrote in. The only time I really want, I mean, oh no, it dealt with me enough. They see the shit. That's true. He does get the looks. That's great. The cigarette is like lighting. You would have been, what do you think about laws?

Speaker 4:          00:18:09       They're passing where you can't smoke outside certain said. You know what? I'll tell you how I feel about the fucking lawyer right now. I don't know why I got in this mode the other night. Like I told you, I just got done. I was in San Francisco doing the, a woody Allen movie, which actually Louis C K is. And also, what is the movie? Tell us about the movie. He doesn't like it to heavy role. Okay. The heaviest dramatic role I've ever played in my life. And, and it, you know, doing scenes with Cate Blanchett, like you standing there going, I can't believe I'm even working with this. Like how the fuck did this happen? They kicked me out of, I got banned from every studio. That was, you know, I made sure to just destroy my career. But she didn't, she didn't know nothing. But cause you're always funny, you never really destroyed it.

Speaker 4:          00:18:57       You were always funny, you know, went through this weird hiatus where people, uh, just to bring my kids up and who doesn't like that fuck them because they're not parents, you know? But the thing is talking about the smoking with the night we got done, me and Max were staying at the four seasons, went to this four star restaurant to celebrate, had some like champagne type stuff. And at the end of the meal I just lit up a cigarette. No, let us restaurant. And Max is looking at me, gone, Dad, we're all right. Don't worry. There's hardly any people. And then the way that comes over, if the few minutes ago, can you do me a favor? Get me an ashtray. You know? And he's looking at, he goes, oh, you can't smoke in here. And I'm done with it. You know, Shit. Put it on the floor or get a glass of water.

Speaker 4:          00:19:44       You know what I mean? Yeah. And it just felt good to have a cigarette and a restaurant again. Well as a nonsmoker. I going to tell you that Shit's disgusting restaurant. It's fucking completely disgusting. Outside of couldn't get her last. Yeah, but it sounds like was a big restaurant. Yeah. Well outside of wouldn't like it if there was like, but I've never done in front of my kids. But you know, I mean it depends on like where you're at. It's the only place I, I light up now and then is in a mall. You know what I mean? Because I don't feel they should have that lawyer and nice and people know I smoked so they should just leave me the fuck alone. You well with all these new laws to be in past, that's probably terrorism. They could probably tase you. You, you know how all this shit about yesterday's podcast, the thing that I've been getting the most shit about his tasering I said that some guy runs in the field and fucking cops are trying to chase a macbook at the cop could blow his fucking knee out. You could eat, you could blow a disc. Try and tackle some dude. Am I going to in a bit like if you, if you think it's not a big deal of tackle, a dude is trying to get away from you. You never really tackled a dude's trying to get away from you and not knowing if that dude has weapons. Joy, you can break of your body. Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       Tasering looks fun. I still have it hand it. Uh, if you want to run out on the field and fuck with a game in front of 2 million people and all the assholes, you know? Yeah. And it's a safe way to take somebody down. If you were a cop, sorry, Dick said, sorry. Dick. Head to when somebody is trying to break into his house and a cop tasers them. There'll be thanking his fucking ass. I don't know who said it, but fuck silly. Cribbing buddy. Let's point up thing. Go to cop did dish. So just one thing. Yeah. You be in those neighborhoods and, and want to have to get home to your kids that night. You'd do what you gotta do. That's it. Well, I think a lot of them have, so it's a lack of better than shooting somebody. Yeah. I think a lot of them have massive amounts of pressure built up that we can't even understand as a person.

Speaker 3:          00:21:34       We don't have to deal with violent crime on every fucking on a daily basis. We don't know what kind of build up those guys have. And by the way, I think he should be fucking mandatory. They should actually learn how to fight. You know, I've met dude's in the work cops and I met him in Jujitsu class. I'm like their first day and I'm like, Holy Shit son, you're a white belt and you're a cop like you. You better learn how to strangle some fucking people. Like you're going to, you know, someone might want to try and take your gun. Do you know that that can happen. You better learn how to fight, bitch, are you crazy? You're going to go out there with a gun and a fucking target and you don't even know how to fight. And I don't know how much they teach them.

Speaker 3:          00:22:08       I don't know how much it's, it's a dedicated to hand to hand combat. But coach should be your whole job. Hand to hand combat and how to hold on to your gun. That should be like all your training. Totally the filing. It's true. But listen man, I'm just aware motherfuckers out there. Let's talk about show you just did the theater in a way where you just Denver the paramount theater in Denver. Yeah. Fucking awesome. And how was that for you? Oh it was, cause I like interviewing you too. Oh it was amazing. You know, now you're doing these big theaters, which you know a little from everything you've been working on. It's all from the [inaudible] know how great you know this podcast is and what you could do for yourself. You know, because my whole thing has always been about accomplishment in life. And look what you're doing now.

Speaker 3:          00:22:57       I mean, you know, five years ago I think he was still in clubs. Now you're doing these big theaters and two years ago it was mostly doing club. And that's commendable. I mean you're doing two, three, 4,000 seaters now. And that's of course it is because she put in the work and it's, I'm proud of you brother. Thank you very much. I mean I had done some theaters in the past besides breaking limbs on cops in between. You go and do concerts and that's a good thing. I just want to help the cops. No, I know you though. I know a lot. A lot of cops in MMA. I know a lot of cops because of a Jujitsu. So I would like when, when everybody people shit on cops. I've always been wanting to defend cops. That's a, that's a really, really hard job. You know, I've talked to people, I've heard horror stories, Kaiser on the job and they're not trying to be assholes, but if you, you lived a life where your job all day, people were lying to you all day.

Speaker 3:          00:23:44       People align you and try to get away with shit. That's like most of the time if you're talking to somebody that you, when I was growing up there with three things that either want them to be doing what I'm doing now, a cop or an attorney, and you know how it changed my mind. I'm being a cop. When I would take the train in Brooklyn every day into Manhattan, what pricks people would just to fucking take a seat. How they would just knock out of the fucking way. I go, I don't want to protect these motherfuckers. I want to kill him. You know what I mean? So that changed my mind on net, you know, and the attorney, well, let's face it, my schooling just wasn't up to par, but he's good at, he's good. Yeah. I could dissect. I don't fight with him. Hell you, it's horrible.

Speaker 3:          00:24:26       I know how to break it down like an attorney. Even when my kids, when they were really little, I used to have like an argument and take them in the living room and I'd sit him down and I go, okay, we're going to have the trial. There was horrible. Oh remember we remember what the bathroom in my bedroom in the house dead, Eh, that I led the LRE stay at? No, no, no, no, no. A Valerie owner. Alright. Sometimes I call it valid or, and she's Ellery gets fucked up. So there was this towel rack in my bathroom and one day, you know, near the shower I come in and it's broken. So you know, I got a Mac so I'm going to do and I go, well who broke the rack? Nobody's admitting it. So now the trial has to happen, you know, and I just break down where they were, what they were doing.

Speaker 3:          00:25:13       Dylan, it's still going on the trial. Still going on years later I'm going to get to the bottom of it and then the punishment will happen because I'll break their towel rack. But I liked that Max is staying quiet about it. He's not, yeah, he's not, he's not ratting on his brother and he's not well listen, first of all Max, he knows he's got a great roll the dice man. Like literally, literally you've got a great roll the dice in life. I mean your father is Andrew dice clay. That's a fucking, you're already on awesome street from the jump. Well, you know, what does your dad do? Oh my dad. Oh, nothing. Andrew dice clay [inaudible] that way because you can't put it that way because I always brought them up that I am dead. You are no look, you are very humble and you're very normal, but you're still Andrew motherfucking dice clay and I throw up having Andrew dice clay as a dad.

Speaker 3:          00:26:07       That's pretty sweet. You know, that's not, you know, they're preparing. They're doing the special with me. That's what, yeah, no roadmap. Do new breath, man. They did your show in um, in uh, in Vegas they're rehearsing. How great is the Riviera? Don't you love it? A God damn like it's, it's like a cultural experience that fucking, we haven't changed those pictures on the walls and forever. They have these photos from the river here from the fifties and sixties and seventies. the 80s. I mean, it's like a history lesson. It's incredible. When I grade their, that's why like playing those, hold the hotel. I love that place so much on it. And the show room still has that feel of like if you were in there, they actually shut casino in that hotel. Did they really had the movie keeps saying, Oh that's right. You know I stayed in the Casino Room when, when uh, yeah, Steve Sharp.

Speaker 3:          00:26:57       He used to stay upstairs in the two bedroom. I'll put you in a supernatural room, show you, I got you in the Sinatra Room. He was like, who's the best? What a fucking great guy. He was running a the Riviera. He would do all the comedy from the river Yarra. He was so fun. I would so look forward to hanging out with him. But man, you do not fuck with that guy man. I've seen that guy snap on people. Holy Shit with some asshole threw his cigarette on the carpet and sharp. If a trip is a big fucking guy, he got them.

Speaker 5:          00:27:26       Hey asshole. Fuck that fucking bought off. You do this shit in your house in 40 your mother fucking piece of shit. Pick it up.

Speaker 3:          00:27:36       Fuck Outta here. Fuck brings it to, it's a giant guy. And he brought it to 10 immediately. You could not be an asshole rusher up. Fuck it. I love people with a short fuse where you could tell [inaudible] seen some real live violence, does it? He's a, he's kicked it up to a level that lets you know he sees, I mean, that's not a fakers level. That's a level of, he's willing to take it to a dark place,

Speaker 5:          00:28:00       dark, dark

Speaker 3:          00:28:01       place. Right quick. I know I can always smell dudes who are just ready to take it to def con four and Syrup as one of those, you know, I want to fuck with that guy. That's no bullshit. He's a great guy though. I never had a problem with them. I always love talking to him. He's such a fun guy, but he's a hilarious guy. He could easily done stand up. He's doing it now. He should be doing it. He's kicking it. Easily been doing it. I tell him, look, you know, I had this great talk with sure ripple when he was on soprano's. Like you know, almost like the talk we had years ago. Only about like, why aren't you setting yourself up for like an ABC Sitcom? He was perfect for it, right? Like to play a father and now, oh no, it's telling me, well, he's first doing it now.

Speaker 3:          00:28:43       Now he's doing a lot. Because I thought he was, you know, even though he played a gangster and Sopranos, you could see he's not a gangster. You could see he could be a regular nice guy. He played, the guy that he played was like really demure. Much different than him as a person. He's a really good actor for playing. The tambourine didn't do standup to like told them when we did a print this, I go, so you're going to hit the road. I figured he did stand up. He goes, I don't do standup. I go, what the fuck are you doing on the show then? You know what I mean? What are you doing? What are you, what are you trying for here? And then he started to stand up right after that he started and never came home. We're scared to stand up, some of you know what I mean? I gotta be honest. I'm a week away from shooting this special and I know, I know my shit down pat now, but you start thinking, do I really know it? Because once you're out there, you're alone. It's you and the audience. And that's what we want to show. Or two shows for the films. I'm going to tape two shows. I really only wanted to do one, but showtime wants them to do the too because I'd rather

Speaker 4:          00:29:42       have my back against the wall and have to come out swinging. Yeah. Because I feel like I've been a fight awaiting in the cage to go fight. You know what I mean? This is two years in the making the special and it is a New Year's eve special. And you know, I should say where I'm doing it. We're doing it in a Chicago. What's the theater with the Arcadia theater to theater. It's our sale now. A theater. And it's actually going to be my last special, you know, and not because I'm an old man. I'm going to tor and I, you know, I got other plans for movies and I got a book coming out by uh, not this year. They, they like into the early part of next year. So there's a lot I got to do. So I just want to really do one more special that I feel I really all myself, you know, and fans and really just fucking bang them over the head with this shit and you know, just go out a winner. Can I make a prediction? I'm going to make a prediction, right? You, the special that you're doing this upcoming special in Chicago at the arcade at theater will create the resurgence that will make it impossible for you to not do another special.

Speaker 1:          00:30:51       People realize how funny what you're doing is when people realize like it, when people are starting to like remember how fucking funny and hilarious some of your shit was and when we went to see that special or it won't do what whatever you did, what version of what I'm working on, that version is going to kick people's Dick, right? Dirt Shit was,

Speaker 4:          00:31:11       well, I talked about my respect for you as a comic because you're, you're in that, that thing that I'm in the kind of comedy you've done, whatever we call out genre, whatever the fuck it is now when you say it to me, I believe you. Oh, you know what I mean? I'm telling you the things you're doing and what I'm doing. We've got a team up. We got to do some shows. Love to do you know what I mean? Just me and you.

Speaker 1:          00:31:37       When I was in open miker dude, I used to listen to your cassette, your cassette in my fucking car. I would listen to it all the way to gigs and I told her, I'll never forget this guy, Mike Donovan in the back of the comedy connection in Boston, crying, laughing, tears coming down his eyes, crying, laughing, listening to your, the day the laughter died during your impression, your impression of a doing Nixon in a girl's ass and he's crying and laughing and I, I'll never forget that. I'll never forget that. That was to me, like as a an up and coming comedian. I was just like starting on and I was like listening to this like established Boston comedian just laughing. He was going, it was fucking crying. Tears were coming down his eyes. It was so silly to him. It

Speaker 4:          00:32:21       was so, well, the thing is you have that effect too. And that's why we'd be great together. And it's funny, anytime I want to do shows with another, what we'd call headline as scars, it's always hard because of like egos who goes on if the hoe. And I'm like, you know, just like we talked about fighting list time that you'd be the only guy in comedy. I wouldn't want to fight because there's no way to walk away a winner in something like that. No, I wouldn't fight him. You know what I mean? Throw. I mean, if I had to, I mean if you push the buttons, I don't know. It'd be like a wild cat. Nobody's going home saying I didn't get hurt. You know what I mean? So he's that guy. So it would be the same thing if we were working together. Like, he would be the only guy that I'm going, you know what, if he's got to close the show, let him close to show because he was a fucking animal.

Speaker 4:          00:33:06       You know what I mean? It's, you know, most comics can't go on after me, you know, so I don't even know how it would work, but either way, any way. And I would be honored. It would be so fun. I wouldn't, but I'm saying I want to go on if the you, because you really, you know, when you get that first shot at the crowd, it's like you don't have the pressure to close the show. That happened when I did a show with that fucking, uh, Bill Mod, this asshole that, that, you know, and, and I wanted to do to shut, this is the last, the last time, you know, I did all the, you know, what happened? 300 arena shows. No, I'm going to tell you what happened. I did over 300 arena shows, right? This is before computers does, before it hit hard ticket sales.

Speaker 4:          00:33:49       So in 2000 when I was going back to the garden, you know, I was thinking, who could open that show for me? And I saw a special from Bill Maher when he does his regular stand up, he's a filthy dirty pig like I am on stage. Okay. So I called bill and I say, you know what? You've always been great with me. You know, when, uh, you know, when I come on, you're politically incorrect show with whether it was on MTV or ABC or whenever he did it, I would always do it. And it was great. So I said, so why don't you do, I went back to the garden in 2000. I said, why don't you do the garden with me? And he goes, well, I'm not an opening act. I call, I'm not calling you was an opening act. I go, I'm calling, we'll co headline, everything's equal.

Speaker 4:          00:34:31       And the bottom line, he was afraid to do it, I could tell. And so we decided, I said, well, go somewhere else in the country and see how it works. So we pick a Phoenix, the celebrity theatre in Phoenix. So I'm going to close the show, right? Jim Norton's going to open it. I'm going to go on at the end and bill and bill will go on if the Norton, so two days before the show, my agent calls me up and he's like, I got a call from his people saying he wants to close the show. And I just said, you know what? That's up to him. I don't care. I go, all these fucking guys are the same. It's unbelievable. I go, if he wants to go on after me, let him go on estimate. No, I'm going to tell you what happened. So tonight is show, you know I'm already on stage. You know, cause Norton went up and now like I'm telling you, I feel no pressure to close the show. So I do to kind of puff. I go fucking nuts. And Bill actually shows up as I'm doing the show and he sees this crowd going fucking ballistic. So now it's time for him to go on. And you know, he sets up the stage.

Speaker 5:          00:35:38       He said, it's up on the stage, a music stand with cardboard notes of his act. So now he's brought on stage, he's brought on stage, I'm behind the curtain watching, and he freezes. I mean, really freezes. He doesn't talk. And I'm back there. I'm fucking say something, you know, like, um, he gets booed off the stage and for fucking minutes now he's in his dressing room doing whatever he's doing to relax himself. And he got on stage for four minutes, four minutes, it comes off. But now to promote it comes, he goes, I don't want to give money back. We gotta get this guy back on stage. So I go in the dressing room, I'm talking to him as he's doing whatever he's doing. And I said, Bill, you know, it's rock and roll comedy, man. Just go out there and he starts going up the steps and you start screaming, I'm a fucking monologist.

Speaker 5:          00:36:31       And I want to look at them and go, well, what the fuck am I? Because I'm in a leather. I'm not a monologist. Yeah, right. You know, so he goes on and maybe a third, maybe a third of the crowd is left. Right, right. And this asshole, if the every joke, they're like, the audience is taking potshots at you fucking suck ass hole. And then you see him run to the camera that he was filming. It's set to get the tape. I would have loved to have that fucking tape. And after the show is making all the excuses, and I want to say, asshole, why on earth would you ever want to follow a guy that gets done the fucking Rosebowl? You're not that kind of fucking performer. But I let him walk in the hug because he was fucking frazzled and he was just trying to save face, you know?

Speaker 5:          00:37:19       But he's a fucking terrible, that's a terrible idea for when I see him on his show with the politically incorrect, I look at him like, yeah, we really know who you are, don't we? That's how I look at this guy, right? Like you've got no fucking chops. You just got no fucking chops and listen. But see, I would do a show with, you know when you're going in front of me, no one, you're going to fucking kill him because that just brings me up. Yeah. Now I got to write. It's just like doing this movie. Come on. This movie, I'm up against Alec Baldwin, Cate Blanchett, Sally Hawkins. These are fucking academy nominees, Golden Globe winners, and I'm gone. You're just going to have to rise to the fucking occasion. The better the actor, the better. My work is going to be. The same thing with the better. Like Norton was probably the best opening act they ever had as a guy because I will say Eleanor to me is the best female standup in the country. She just needs that exposure now. But Norton would come on and fucking slayed the crowd every time and he's brought all fucking day long. He's the only show I went to over the last four years to just sit and got her to show and watch him work and I sat to two shows and he was just great. I'm an Austin. He was fucking phenomenal. He's a great, great, he's one of the great comics up today. You know what I mean?

Speaker 4:          00:38:36       And so again, it's the same sort of ridiculous fucking overexaggerated hilarious kind of standup comedy. Very, very dirty, very out there. But you know, it's, it's a fucking legitimate art form. It really pisses me off when guys like you or guys like Norton or anybody who does something that's particularly dirty or crafts, whatever, then it doesn't get as as much respect. It's so stupid. Well No, this is my point. They're denying that it's hilarious. They're trying to pretend like, well the other way is harder to do, so it's better. Well that's not true. Just because it's harder to make something clean and clever doesn't mean it's better cause they're all stuff makes me laugh. It doesn't mean I don't have intellectual interim Italians when it comes to comedy. That shit is a legitimate fuck art form. I was just at a, you know, like I said, I've been going all over the country, prepare on the special service, just the governors and you know, go and you've been there, have a town.

Speaker 4:          00:39:32       Everybody's been, but everybody's been great club. So after the show, the own is a mark and James, they say to me, we voted you tonight the biggest lifts that ever happened in this room. So I don't care how dirty, clean, the biggest laughs that ever happened. That's what, and that's the bottom line laughing. And let me tell you something about 30 units not so dirty when, when you're talking about everything that goes on in life, in a comedic cartoonish, wet. Yeah. You know, I mean Eleanor became great because she's facing the hardest crowds to face. Right. I would think your crowds and the other hardest crowds to face, you have animal audiences, real people, blue collar people come in to see you perform and they will. Yeah. Right. Yeah. I mean the first time she worked a Westbury with me, she got booed off. No, because, because what, what I admired about it and she was really green.

Speaker 4:          00:40:25       This is shut up. Shut your mouth. I am trying to say something nice about you. I am defending. So, but the fact that she was doing comedy three months and had the balls to face that fucking crowd was where I gave her the respect and now she goes out and she just slays the crab because they'd been the hardest crowds. It's the, it's, it's like basic training when you open for me. So I could imagine. Well, you know what's funny because of the podcast, all the people that work with me on the road or all my friends from the podcast, it's all Joey Diaz and Ari Shaffir and Duncan Trussell and Brendan Walsh, the fucking puppet, the puppet, Little Hobo. Ha Fun. When he does that thing with the thing and they say like, thanks Lloyd, was she with the fucking Prass genius one night he did it. I want you to fucking throw him such a beating because he didn't put his heart into it.

Speaker 4:          00:41:23       And I sacked it through the whole fucking act, waiting for the puppet to turn into the devil, whatever with the prayer and see people running from the show. And he didn't do it the way I wanted. And I was like, I fucking told you fucking rare. I'm going to sit in a room and watch you. I want to see the prayer, the prayer kit. I think my whole act down or going on stage at you in the morning, two in the fucking morning. People are sleeping on the fucking table. That's right. That's how you, I even tell him Max that I go, when you play these places like Marty's and there's five people who gives a fuck about and segment, just work your bits. Because if he could work the silence, the land, I'm going to be me and Kennison. We're on every night back to back between one and two in the morning.

Speaker 4:          00:42:12       We were the last two this before you ever came out to la and the crowd would, whoever was there walked out knowing they saw something special. You know, it wasn't just one after the other. Well, my parents who gives a fuck if they limit, you know, no real fucking like my son Max when he's putting bits together. You know, I say certain things when I do on stage are very like you know, out there and it's just for the effect of making them laugh and other things like when I talk about these new generation pigs and how they are, you know, the, the, the generation that you know, years ago, like I, I'd always, I always knew what slobs women were in bed right on north. Yeah. Cause he, he or she is, you know, but, but you, but you know, you know, 20 years ago they didn't want to admit to the pigs that they are today.

Speaker 4:          00:43:03       There is so aggressive. It's so much material to talk about on stage. Like when I get a friend calling me and go and so I went out with this girl, I wind the doing everything to her that when I banged her rash, she looked at me and said, I used to be really good at this unthinking, what? Take it to Jiffy Lube. You know what I mean? The guy was like, nope, because a girl 20 years ago would never look back at you and say, I used to be good at this, taking in no at anything. They would just, if they even did that, they wouldn't even talk about it today. They're almost giving you a fucking checklist of what they will and won't do and you feel, you feel like the chick that the next day after you've done everything to them, my friends go. So I called the girl, you know the the call to like say how you doing today and she's gone, I'll call you back in a few.

Speaker 4:          00:43:54       And it's been three fucking days. Like she did everything and couldn't care less about it. That sounds like a dude who didn't fuck her correctly. No, no. Let me tell you something. I went proper. Let me tell you. So I went to a fucking ton of them between now and orange and Valerie, you know, just one after the other load if the fucking load, I'm not even doing material in between Illinois and meeting my wife. It was a revolving door, you know, get even Max nearly got the bang one of them, you know, which which, which was ridiculous. And um, I set him up with some

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       people. It was good. No but, but what I'm saying is, so I saw what was out there and, and it's like, you know, they really do that. I don't care how good you are in bed. A girl could just bang a guy and the next day forget it. You used to do have a one night stand. That's how they look at it now. It's definitely a different world. Oh my God, please. It's a different, the age of information because of the fact that they can get on their phone and watch them and taking the house. You can't stop them. They grew up on fucking us today at 19 feel. If they didn't post a picture of diarrhea. So lips on the Internet, they're not as hip as deaf fucking girlfriends all it's true to say, you know how they say like beams profile, you know, how did he say being 40 years old profile picture will be being 40 years old is like the new 30. I think. Anybody who says that's an ass no, but you know how they do that? Like green is the new blue. The asshole has become the new bushing. It's to no fucking pussy. It's like, come on, wait, what happened to the blue? They blow it out of control. I guess people don't blow it out of control. Joey, they blow it out if they want to fuck. And then I want to get anybody pregnant.

Speaker 3:          00:45:44       It's too bad there's not an extra vagina. And so like you have a baby, make it vagina and then uh, you know, the asshole when we would just leave it alone, but we wouldn't even live in fucking Vegas. Now. What'd you say? Ellen was going to be opening in the show in Chicago. We to talk coping, very excited about it. And the band's going to be opening up to show also in a Chicago kicks that Baritone a couple of notches when he gets on the mic. La Rock, we got presence. We just picked up the drum skin, right? I've just got the drums first official La rock think it's so cool that you have the show where you, you know, it's like you're traveling with family, you know, and I think that's a really important aspect of the road. And that's one of the things that's made it big for me.

Speaker 3:          00:46:40       I said when I do these shows, like with Joey Diaz or Duncan Trussell where these guys are my family, they're my friends. We've been friends for a decade plus and we always will be. So when we go on the road together, it's just, it's your thing. Yeah, we're all real really Eleanor. I mean, how long do I know, you know, Eleanor was the finest waitress ever at the comedy store and everybody tried to talk to you. I don't know if I tried to talk you into doing something that I'm sure everybody does show. I was engaged to this fucking girl, right? Paula Brown. Oh, why Tolo why this is what happens, right. We break up were broken up for six

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       weeks. Right now I get the call because, because, because I was having all these fights at the comedy store for like about six, seven months. I was got, you know, it was under a lot of pressure from the ex wife with the kids and everything going on. So somebody fucked with me. I would get physical, you know, it came, that was one time I was kicking this guy's head in the front of the store, the cops. It was crazy. So now I'm fucking damn I rarer and no, it's shut up. See what I mean? She goes, hey guys. Had like a confrontation. No, no. But Dom has always been, you know, since since the day I took off, it was always, and I love dom as a comic. He's a great, he's one of the great comics, but he would always bring up debt. I'm Jewish, like, like, like, like a Jew camp.

Speaker 4:          00:48:14       Be Good looking from Brooklyn and have a fucking attitude if he's not Italian, right? So he would go on radio shows and say my last name, like, no, I'm telling you what happened. But Ellen was really great friends with dumb, which is fine. But now one night, you know, I've had a couple of things happen with dom where he did this jute thing and I'd have to get in his face, just straightened them out, but without violence. Right? So now a couple of years goes by. Now I'm on stage in the, uh, original room just working on material on a Monday night and not on for more than 15 minutes. And he had comes a dom and I want to make fun of them and he's gone, when are you going to be done? He's interrupting me now. And you know what? You don't interrupt somebody that's done what I've done.

Speaker 4:          00:48:58       We're not if the comedy factory outlet anymore, you're not even in my fucking league. You know what I mean? And he's gone. When you get a Goddamn, do yourself a favor. Get out of the room. I'm trying to help you here. Just get the fuck. And he keeps going. And I said, you know what, you want me to come off stage. I'm coming off the fucking stage. And I'd come after him and I get them at the front booth that a comedy store and he makes the mistake of touching me and I slam him against the wall is his head breaks a fucking one of the eight by tens on the wall. And I'm going to bash his face in, but our, but our, he jumps on me and Steve Reynolds easy. John saw me and Steve Simone jumps on me and then this fucking asshole wants to walk by me and go, I'm funnier than you.

Speaker 4:          00:49:41       So now I got to grab him by the back of his jacket. I pull him back. I'm like, why the fuck would you even put yourself in the same league with me? You're a fucking club hack. That's all you are. I played the biggest fucking places in the world. Get the fuck out of this place. I drawn down the steps, right? Well now I'm in the back and I'm actually angry at her because she has broken up about five fights at the time. And his store, he's Steve Simone, let me finish. Let me finish. So Steve Simone, I go, where the fuck was Eleanor? Cause I can't lift my hands to anybody. If he didn't touch me, I couldn't have done anything. So she goes, she said let them work it out themselves. I'm telling you what the fuck. He said, tell you what. All right, so, so now, so the next morning, me and Eleanor have the fight over this.

Speaker 4:          00:50:30       So you know, she leaves, slams the door, we're broken up. Six weeks goes by. Now she calls me and says, I'm moving to New York. Okay. So I'm actually going to pick up Dylan who's doing Hebrew lessons and me and Max it talking about. And I go, all right, we can't let her leave. So I got into comedy story, so let's get married. Let's just get married, forget the fight. You know what I mean? So we, you know, we do like an instant, you know, engagement, you know, and a, and d and that's how we got engaged.

Speaker 6:          00:51:02       Well, you, you pull your picking up. We already sticking up for dom. That's why I always mean when you go in with a girl, every comic in the world was calling her. That's not what it's about. I go, look, I'm the fucking guy. I don't give a fuck about dom. He's nice guys, a good comic. But when it comes to anything between me and your weird, a couple, I'm the one on top of you pump mulloway every night. That's dumb. You're not looking at a it, it had a lot to do with this Mac wait time. Yes ma'am. Why do you, why are you so hello?

Speaker 6:          00:51:37       Let us fight this out because he started, no, first of all, it has nothing to do that fucking special personal shit. And so it was, it was affecting every night, every store. And so when I quit, I thought that would be better. And then we did live together for you, but didn't work out our engagements. Fine. I'm your sister wife now. No, she's the greatest girl in the world. Why? Yeah. That's so bizarre. But one of the greatest guys in the world, he was just literally, and he truly didn't know that. That's a bizarre scenario that I went out with him. First of all, please Oprah Click move on dice, because it's not easy to score the captain of the cheerleading.

Speaker 4:          00:52:15       I always thought Illinois was a nice guy. I never made moves towards a, and when I actually started coming on to her all, she knew I was happily married with two kids. No, she actually was, was babysitting my kids in Vegas when they were like, no, but how old were they at the time? Dylan was how old? Almost like too. I too. I was like six. So Max is sick. Yeah. You know, so I mean, you know, I would do anything in the world fell in or w we off family. I do know. And uh, but, but that's how it came down. So I was just aggravated that at of all the arguments and fights I was getting at and the comedy store, she didn't come back me up on the I rarefied. Yes. Everyone wasn't against Tom, you know, because damn did have the balls.

Speaker 4:          00:52:55       I gotta I gotta I got a lot of respect from because after the fight, all of a sudden he comes dumb into the kitchen and I'm standing next to Ellen on now and I'm coming down from the whole thing and it goes dice, I want to talk to you. And I'm like, damn, it's the biggest mistake you can make coming near me now. And he kept coming in. In my mind I'm going, if this guy has the guts to get within arms reach, I'm going to talk to them. And then we spot, you know, we talked about for two hours and you know, and we haven't talked since. But anyway, it's all good. I love both of you and can I love dom, I railroad like a brother. No dumb. You know, I, I, dom can be a little hostile though on occasion if especially if he feels disrespected.

Speaker 4:          00:53:34       And let me tell you something. If dom was a different way, you know, we were on the same special with Rodney c w with dom. I got a history with dom because when I used to do Philly as a struggling comic, I would always headline the comedy factory outlet. And Dom is from Philly. I was from Brooklyn, so a clay here who owned the club would it book dom a lot of times to open the show for me. So all the way from then to the Rodney special, and then I just blew up from the Rodney special and he started right away with the like to me antisemetic bullshit because if he didn't, he would have been the perfect opening act for all of those arenas. But everybody assumed that your accent was an Italian thing. Why he I look, you know what I mean?

Speaker 4:          00:54:20       When you think of a Jew, you know, you think of, you think of [inaudible]. You know what I mean? He's got, God knows that. You know what I mean? If you are a decent looking person with an attitude, immediately you are an Italian guy. But what was hilarious is like what Italian do you know the was a giant motorcycle jacket with the collar. I'm like the wholesale. So about the attitude. I've always had a certain attitude. Right. But it's the, the, it's, it's more of a New York thing than it is an Italian thing. But for whatever reasons, people thinking in that way. Yeah. Italians have before long gone, I would see arguments go on between two men about my, my mother being Italian, you know, and I would go, no, she's Jewish. She's my mother. I would know. And they'd be like, dice. And these are like gangster guys going, you don't know what you're talking about.

Speaker 4:          00:55:10       This is between me and him. I go to my mother, I know what my mother room, where was this? You know, this is in Brooklyn. This was at a flea market that they turned a c is department store into a flea market. So I go there like every Saturday because I love to shop and buy cotton things and you know, wristbands, sweat, sweat, sweatshirts, sweat socks. I couldn't buy enough of them. And it was all booths. You know what I mean? And I love going there and this is when I was doing like Nassau Coliseum so people would freak out that I'm there. So all these fights would start, cause the minute I'd be around guys they would turn their attitudes on like they had to like gout, dice, dice. It was crazy and Brooklyn for me. But I love it whenever you get around any young men looking to prove themselves and you're a 30 year olds. I was 30 and going dice. You don't understand. I know your mother for 25 yeah, I can put, I know it since I was born, I was bar Mitzvah'd. They cut his dick off when I was born. I had a Bris they wanted to claim you. It was hysterical. You know, you know, but you know in this photo, but it's never, it's not like know you ever said

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       that you were Italian. It's not like anything you've ever hid. It's no, it's just for whatever reason they claimed it for like a little while. They're still claiming it. But you know, I grew up in a neighborhood, it was all Jews and Italians. That's what I grew up with. But the thing that disturbs me is that like at living in New York, I know a lot of Jews who talk exactly the same way. You want to know what not. It's not a thing that only Italian stone. It was funny Redmond, it was the Irish guys. It was the Irish guys that would, that would, that I'd fight, that would put me in the hospital all the time. And then that's what I wanted up. My ex wife is Irish. Um, fucking Eleanor's Irish Irish dudes who've been, I had a friend who had his finger bitten off in a street fight when he's on PCP and he had his toe come on e Bay.

Speaker 3:          00:57:13       He had his toe cut off to replace the finger and he had it permanently bent so he could keep throwing his right hook. So he would shake your hand. He was on PCP, might cut his own finger roll. You shake your hand. He would, uh, finger would be like tickling me. But he was a hell of a boxing coach. Joe Lake, shout out to Joe Lake, Shell Lake. He's a great guy. Tremendous guy. Joey fucking ass. Sick. Awesome Irishman from Boston. Like a real guy. Like if you made a movie about my friend Joe Lake, he was a Longshoreman who was a professional boxer, a great boxing coach, trained a bunch of great boxers and he was a fucking animal. He was talking about via fighting. No violence. You don't know psychos like this? No, no, I do. My wife Valerie, you know, you reminded me. No, no, no cycle. But just to shout out with some sexy when you get to Vegas tomorrow with something high school. Well this is what that was. You know what that was? That was to make sure that she's listening. Did you listen to me? Listen to me. What? I send that thing to you. You didn't listen to me. Oh, she likes really, really put it together. She likes putting it together. You know the Mexican girls with the colors and the fuck. Good. Really beautiful by the way.

Speaker 3:          00:58:28       You've scored. She's really beautiful. I met her in Vegas and I was just blown out of the water. She's very coarse dice clay bank. You respect. Thank you. [inaudible] I respect that compliment. It's a good compliment. But you didn't say anything dirty about it like when you walked away. No, no, no. Thank you. Where your Spec you too Joe. Right? Never. Never. You know, cause I would never say nothing about yours unless she was beautiful and I'm not that kind of a guy I ever met. You'll go, no, I'll keep her away from now. You marry your story. I've heard she's beautiful though. Very nice person. That's the most important thing, man. I've been around pretty girls before that weren't nice. Yeah. But they've got to have the subside. I gotta Shit. My wife is sweet. She's smart. She backs up my career with that. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:59:14       Doing everything I'm doing because she told me to go do it. That's beautiful. That's, that's simple that in that case relationships are always worth it. So many of us settle for some sort of a weird combination of, uh, of that and then an enemy that you live with that. So that's gets real weird. People get real weird with that man and was a lot of times you even [inaudible]. Even though me and Eleanor broke up, we were never enemies do all of it. Yeah. We had I think a lot of fighting between people that you started off getting along good. I just don't like when she interrupts me, you know when I'm around him right now it's called compensation. I don't know. This is how guys do it. That's okay with us, but every people, people will listen to the podcasts all the time and go dice, interrupt you constantly.

Speaker 3:          01:00:02       I'm like, you've never done once we're just talking. Yeah. She goes to that high pitch. Yeah. That nasally when you're all talking at the same time and nobody can predict who's going to be talking or what's going on or something comes into your head. You got to say it. You got to go with the flow of a conversation and that includes interrupting people. We're not in a David Mamet movie. It doesn't have to like follow a fucking script saying I can't talk to you because you two are men and I'm in your face. Me that much bothers me. Only a little of the smoke bothers you. It does. When he does it oddly because I love them and I'm trying to get them to not worry about it again. You need red and listen. If I love him, he's great. He's a great friend. If we do the rub, that's where you break my balls with the cigarettes cause then you'll need me to, I'll look.

Speaker 3:          01:00:52       I, I only hung out with you a few times and I would sit down and have the conversation with you know, but you, but I do love you. You're a great guy. I like being around you. I love your act. I respect you very much. As an artist, I think that poisoning your body with cigarettes is a stupid way to die. Not only that, but you don't understand. I'm going to, I'm going to go. You don't understand. It's a way though. It's why did I start that again? Okay. I didn't smoke for 10 cold years. He made me quit when my father was on his last days. I lit up. So I'm only smoking a year. It's not about an excuse, it's just what happened. I am going to quit again, but this is not the week it's happening. Well you know what, you, you know what the fuck is best for you.

Speaker 3:          01:01:36       You're not a child and I would never tell you what to do or what not to do. What can you advise and Max as well. We want them to quit on me with it, but they also understand what I'm going through. But it also, you know, I've got to respect, Brian said something on the podcast the other day. I said, why do you like to smoke? And he fucking pretty passionate about how great it feels and how much he loves it and how it's great after a meal. And you know what? I got to respect that as a human being. He's got a right to make a choice and that choice, but I'm also smart enough. That's why I did quit cause I just didn't want to smoke anymore. You know? And I would hold an unlit cigarette. I didn't kept people smoked around me. I just got to wean myself off of it again. Well, and when I quit, I won't even wean it, you know, I'll just quit and that'll be it. I bet I would

Speaker 1:          01:02:19       enjoy it. I bet I wouldn't show the nicotine rush. Steven King said it was one of his, um, his, uh, biggest cognitive benefits and that the, uh, that smoking gave him rather cognitive benefits and that he recognized a big difference when you quit smoking. He said his, uh, his, his brain was firing slower as creativity wasn't as, as, as rampant, which a, you know, I'm sure I would like to just not the moment, you know, for me right now, I like cigars. I enjoy [inaudible] hates to go after a fat steak. There's nothing like chilling with a cigar. I love it. Fat Stay. Me and Kevin James have murdered some fucking steaks. We smoked some fat Cuban cigars before and it's a pleasure. And it's a real buzz too. It's kind of weird. Mellow high. It's not a high where you're worried about driving a car or anything like that.

Speaker 1:          01:03:03       You have total control of your sentence, but it's like a, but it's like, ah, it's just, ah, it's a reason why I quit smoking cigars for one hit off a cigar. I feel stoned. Yeah. It makes it kind of like, it does, it does make you high a ball, you know, nicotine in its natural form, like in the, that, that form of tobacco that you get in a cigar. First of all, it's not as bad for you. And second of all, it's used in shamonic rituals. They use it in Peru, in the Amazon and IOWASCA rituals. This schamens will below the tobacco smoke in your face, in the middle of the psychedelic trip to to create bigger and broader psychedelic experiences, like to actually instigate them. So it's gotten psychoactive compounds, smoking. We know we had a guy on the puck county, how he named a rock.

Speaker 1:          01:03:51       We had a guy in the podcast name Rob Wolf, who is the author of the Paleo solution and he said that people chew nicotine gum and it really helps their creativity. So like nicotine itself is probably beneficial in a lot of ways and almost like a caffeine, like there's nothing really wrong with the real problem is a delivery method that's been designed to make sure that you're addicted. It's that paper. Well, it's not just the paper, those chemicals that's mixed into the tobacco that's designed. If you've watched the movie the insider, do you ever watch that movie, Russell Crowe? It's fucking fantastic. Unbelievable. It really based on a real story and based on how the tobacco industry has somehow or another condo, all these politicians into allowing them to do what they're doing, which is pumping thousands of fucking different chemicals. I think it's 590 actually 590 different chemicals are approved and every cigarette, not thousands but hundreds.

Speaker 1:          01:04:40       But, but that's an insane amount of number of chemicals. It's, it's, you think you're getting a cigarette, you're getting like this chemically soaked leaf that's dried out. It's basically the cigarette burning is inconsequential. It's a delivery method for all these chemicals. And so you can call it a cigarette and it Kinda is, but it's also kind of not. It's kind of a delivery method for all these 590 different chemicals and most of them designed to make you addicted. You're not a college professor read, you have all this information. Yeah, but it's just stuff that I've read. It's just stuff that I've read. Look, I've done no research on my own. Also retained it. I only retain things that are important to you and you could ask me things about things that are important to me. They don't even go in there. I felt like almost like a retard sprain.

Speaker 1:          01:05:24       I have a very like half broken, like things that I don't care about. I don't care. I don't give up. Especially once I started making money, I lost all my ability to care about shit. It don't care about like, you know, like people will call me to get me to do things and I'm just fucking, I don't answer the phone. I just disappeared. I was trying to call him mister. Yeah. I shut my phone off and I could get it to taste good for you. No, but I'd get like a text. I bet you know. Let me just call him rather than with the texting. He never picks up. No, that was because I was in my car. I'm like, I have a Porsche. Porsche is so loud. It's a gt three. It's one those racing cars, so when you drive it's like, so that's what you're here and be like, hey guys,

Speaker 7:          01:06:07       didn't car

Speaker 1:          01:06:11       really juvenile acid nine car. It's a total douche bag car. If you looked at the guide dog, you like, what kind of Douche bag needs to drive a car like this?

Speaker 4:          01:06:19       See if I like the portion. I feel about the challenges. Oh, it's fucking true. Car would be American cock. That's what car are we good?

Speaker 1:          01:06:29       Well call would get. Oh and are excited at Cadillac.

Speaker 4:          01:06:33       Oh yeah. You know that. No, but the big Cadillac, the Brown, well this one's from the color of money. I drove in the color of money. I gave her one. I got, I got named it. You shut your face. I got one as a consolation prize when I left. I got a 95 fleet with which you got one is a constellation. Nice enterprises. Yeah. I gave it to me, checked out a hotel, how she would be adult enough to know how to take care of it, you know what I mean? And she would just break it. You broke it and she broke the mirror off the side that because you couldn't back up

Speaker 1:          01:07:08       proper

Speaker 4:          01:07:10       backing up. This is the same argument. I didn't break the mirror. I didn't break any perfect way. And you got a quote and you broke it off man. Okay. We tried to the audience at home. It's not going to give a fuck about who crashed your old car. No, no. But it was just fuck that shit. Your moons, everything. If that was

Speaker 1:          01:07:36       women, I would say, listen baby, we're rich. Let's just fix this shit. Say

Speaker 4:          01:07:40       No, no, no. But I gave it to us so she'd have something to drive away. So by, by the way, those are, those are very difficult to drive and she was able to throw the boxes, you know, it's a big trunk. I love when I love when they roll in this stuff and then they roll it out. That's the best off. He didn't, you know, and I'm thinking, yeah, I filmed, you know Joe. So I was like, I know what breaking up, but I got to get the shot. Know I really enjoyed, well

Speaker 1:          01:08:11       when I was working at the comedy store, when you would do these, you would put on these little in the back

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       and it would be for your own amusement. And I was always like, well what are we gonna do with all this stuff? Just for your own amusement. He would have like, okay, now you're going to come running through the door. Fuck you. And you tackle him shooting a TV show, you know? And you know, and you know, I would shoot it while they were roping, you know what I mean? Because I'm going to afford a set. And he was all handheld camera and it was all, it seemed like a lot of it was just spur of the moment if you, if you saw it, but it's not, I'm really thinking about the episode. Okay. So, you know, I wouldn't tell anybody what they were bad. I would say this is what I need. And sometimes like if we were in the comedy store, a kitchen, you know, that'd be a waitress that I didn't cast in the show.

Speaker 3:          01:09:00       So I would make me get out in the kitchen. I say, you can't be in the shot. And she's like, yeah, I don't care about your drinks. I'm trying to get my shot here. Like Eleanor had a fist fight with wheels in the kitchen one time where wheels is smacking her head again. The only guy who employs wheels these days, I don't see wheels. Wheels go see him. I'd never seen him doing stand up. Well, well he's still, he in Vegas now and he's in Vegas. Who was responsible for the clip to, they used to have where he claimed that he got his start them and fame after he blew you off stage one night at a club very well. But wheels was sort of pushed into things years ago. Well we liked by other people. It had nothing to do with someone. So someone else wrote that forum?

Speaker 3:          01:09:49       Well, no, he was made to do that. We always told me he was like a professional pool player. Yeah, he is wheels and we went to a, so we worked in San Diego. I said, okay. I play a lot of pull too, because I play a lot of pool, a famous makers. I have a professional table in my house. I play in tournaments. I play a lot of pool. So like, so wills, wills tells me that he plays professional pool. So I said, well, let's fuck around and just play a dollar game. $25 later. I'm like, dude, you can't play pool. You can't fucking play pool. He lied. He can barely make a couple of balls. But he's not a professional level. No, but he is a professional liar.

Speaker 3:          01:10:35       No. Let me tell you, Stan didn't trick me 25 games in. Well, you know, he still owes me that money of course. But he's a funny competent. He's just a funny dude to be around. One of the funniest guys selling out in a good dude. I don't mean anything bad, but it's a true story. You can't, you can't fuck with me on the pool table. Well that was the most ridiculous shit. Everything that you can play with. When I went to Vegas the last few times, I would be like, wheels, you want to hang out at night? You know? And he goes, I can't, you know, because of what I'm doing right now. I go, what are you doing? He goes, well I'm doing the inspirational talks. He was hired from some company. He put on a suit

Speaker 4:          01:11:14       and tie five in the morning. He's getting dressed and show up and do these inspirational talks and get paid for it. And he's getting it from the Gary. What's that movie you love? Glengarry Glen Ross. That's where he'd get his monologues. So I'm still the speech. Yeah. Oh my God. Genius. Oh my God. And make a lot of money doing it. Anybody not know? Then he's got his catering company. He had a kid, he's got a catering company called the cannoli. King's herders. Caterings. Very good. Which is gigantic in La. And then he'll just move to South Carolina for a year and then I call him up. I got what's going on? He goes, well we're in Vegas. I got to Walmart it cause we moved here and then he opens a comedy club and then he becomes an inspirational speaker. Next thing you know, you're walking down the street and he's got one of those meet trucks that he started. He, he, you know, wheels, wheels, got a couple of nicknames. One of them was wheels. One of them. Look, wait what you're saying, look at it. Areas number one chef in the country.

Speaker 4:          01:12:25       Well he is a good cook though. He brought some amazing due to the comedy store and it's fucking just so funny character. He's such a character. It's fucking, it's, and he's a very good cook. He's a very good cook. Whatever the fuck he brought to the comedy story, brought a bunch of lists and cocktailing for him. You shut your face. And I was cocktailing and he goes, he goes, listen, Nah. I was screaming. And I go, hey wheels, we need more whatever. He goes, oh, can you call me chef? Yeah. She would work with him and he would do these professional, we're professor Joe. He would do these Jackie. Yeah. But there's nothing wrong with wheels like easy as opposed to it's a little flavor party. He did this party for some uh, black cigarette. Um, that was fast. Newport? Yes. It's gotta be 300 people.

Speaker 4:          01:13:28       Cigarettes. Menthols yeah, my mom, it was African Americans. There wasn't one white person there and I show up with the camera. Right. You know, with, with the camera. Just for footage because I'm filming my show and wheels is like yelling at me. You got to leave, you know, I'm getting paid a lot of money and I'm going wheels. How am I going to get my shot? You know, if I don't show up at the potty and I'm just filming us with him throwing me out of the party and she's waitressing. Not really. I was just rounding up black girls to surround him cause he was taking, I didn't need your help. Trust just fucking hit me girls, why you diminish?

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       You see women are always silent. Get came. It's making this because? Because she picks up the hands, we're not allowed to hit back. Be Clear if that's taking advantage because she keeps putting her hands on me. I hate Eleanor. Please relax. We got to talk about, you know what? I know he, I know he's like a 10th degree, but I happened to know karate kick your Eleanor's wrestled. If I have to use karate to see me wrestle, I did. I want to see a restaurant. We're fictionally but I got pissed off at that. No, because it could ruin like that, you know, thoughts area. Yeah. You know what I mean? He could break and I'm like anything to be on fucking TV. What's wrong with guilt? Oh wait a minute, a minute. And, and Eleanor's defense, me and I rather, and a bunch of people from the comedy store went down and we had a great fucking time.

Speaker 3:          01:15:09       We bought waitresses. Comics had a big group to support Eleanor and she was easy rider. She played this motorcycle girl, boxer sorta type wrestler chick who would a crush pool balls in her hands. But she just wants to do traumatic fucking rolls and tumble salt and the ring, I think, I think it's better for Eleanor. I mean, I've known Eleanor forever. I think it's better for her to not take yourself seriously. So doing something like that, but that's a, your charm, your charm is that you're so ridiculously silly and you're so over the top. Eleanor and I used to do this thing. I don't think we ever talked about it on the podcast. Where did we talk about it? Ask Her for change.

Speaker 3:          01:15:49       When I go on stage, people are like, Hey, can I record it? Listen, I'm not going to figure myself. It was like, are still, it was the stupidest running gag. And I would say, this is what, this is what it was, where you went to listen. I'll explain. I'll explain it. You're not, it's wrong. Her Apron was on and this is what we do. It would be, would go, uh, hey, um, I want, I want to get changed for a dollar for the meter, but do you have change for a dollar? You Go, hold on a second, let me get it. And she would dig in her apron and going this whole routine pretending to masturbate herself to climax it. She didn't want anybody to come in near and people try to rescue where it was fucking hilarious. Hilarious about it. Cause it lets muck, we did it for years, but I'm waiting at home for this tells me, you know, my shift is over at 1130 but now it's two in the morning and she comes walking in telling me that uh, you know, we never kept her late. She was doing that turn up but this is the kind of shit you would do. I'm going and she's helping comics with debt, personal fucking problems. Then I'm like, I don't give a fuck if the guy falls off a cliff. She is waiting here. I got a hard on, you know, as a, as a brother,

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       comedian. I appreciate that. But as someone he loves hilarious Shit. And as someone who also supportive of the fact that that's one of the reasons why she's a professional comedian now cause we all knew she was so fucking funny. I know was when she was just a waitress. Yeah, of course you did. Yeah. We all knew. We all knew no one, no one doubted it. We knew you as a waitress and you would be like the funniest person hanging around with backstage and it was, it was, it was ridiculous that you were an onstage and you would like, I would, I would always go to Eleanor. What if anybody knew one on stage? Is that going to be funding? She'd go hat and like walk away and I knew that.

Speaker 4:          01:17:44       Yeah, watch this watch. I know dude. Do Bruce Mann off? No, don't make one joke. Just do it.

Speaker 6:          01:17:51       When Jews are ugly, we win prizes. Do Dom dom, I can't do that. I can't think of one of my favorite John Joke right now as the, that he adopted an Asian girl to help him with his iPhone. No, but no, but she knows she's going back as soon as I get these apps down. Talk to fucking,

Speaker 4:          01:18:14       but, but she knows every comic problem because doing my own material I'm writing. That's fine. As long as you have that auditing in your own head, you know, everybody is going to, especially in the beginning of [inaudible] Andrew, I'm like, aren't you, you, you run the risk of maybe covering, so this is the best way to hold Smith. This is back when the Oj with thing was happening, right. And I did this whole thing about Marcia Clark dead. Uh, you know, once you realize this was a big TV shot for her, she's still, all of a sudden she'd come into the courtroom with the pumps and, and the scope with the slit up the side, walking down the fucking aisle. Like I want everybody to stare in this fucking ass and get in here for a while and build a TV Korea. So Holtzman did something kind of similar to the j.

Speaker 4:          01:19:06       So I come over at Tim and I know he's not a finger, you know what I mean? And I go, you know, I, I like do that joke. And he goes, well, you know, dice, we overlap. And I just started fucking laughing. He goes, hey, when a guy says that to you, it's like, just do it. It's too fun. You know, like when you approach somebody about a joke that's similar, right? They'll beat the get all defensive. It becomes an argument. Someone's like, well, you know, we overlap. Well, you know, and I'm like, what the fuck did I just started laughing. He's so funny. He is hilarious. But I agree with that kind of in a certain way. Like Brennan Walsh and I overlap on a, uh, a fleshlight

Speaker 1:          01:19:41       joke and I know, I know he didn't read. No, he didn't. He wouldn't have seen my bit and then done a similar bet. He's not that dude, but he had a similar conclusion and I was like, well, that's the obvious thought. You know, like you, you, you thought, I mean, if you're intelligent, you thinking about it, there's a bunch of different ways to approach it. That's one of them. You thought of it. I thought of it. His bits different than my bit, even though it's based on the same premise, I felt like that's overlapping. It's no big deal. We overlap a little bit, but I care.

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       Right. And it's, what is your particular take on things? I want to hear his take on it and someone else has taken, the only problem is when you hear them in a row, the problem is when you hear him like that night in a row, look, if he's middling and you're headlining and then he does the bit and then you really can't do the bit because it's kind of a, it's so similar. You'd have to bring it up. Like you'd go, Hey, I want to cover the subject that's already been covered. Covered in beaten to death. Right, exactly. That's what I would do it in a way, like at the store where like, I know what the other guy brought up, but let me tell you something and then go it. Yeah. At the store. But like when you're on the road doing your show, you wouldn't want that though. You would never want a guy. Oh, but she does like this thing about, I don't want to say it, you know, with the, uh, with the, uh, whispered in the maturity with the glitter.

Speaker 6:          01:20:54       Oh, the old man, the old man do it. When the old man's like, you know, I fool around with older man. I like older men, but when they come nothing comes out. It's like air. It's like right. You know, and then um, but he does something similar or something like that. And I say it's like air and then you're like, well shit, where did that go? Then like two days later I'm like, is that fucking glitter on my face? And I'm like, oh, it's old man river. His balls on my face and that's it. It's something stupid like that. Joe's just staring,

Speaker 3:          01:21:25       you know when you get old and you choke off, it's like a three day process and then by like the third day when it finally, whatever the fuck is in there comes out at like just falls off the Tipi. A cop on the balls, you know what you know about that was Holtzman Holtzman a little bit about a, yeah, it's like, it's, it's old paint that's been the basement too long. He goes, it's not the same call that it used to be. That's real. He got a bit about, uh, I don't want to do is doing a Viagara, but, well, I don't want to say it also because I don't want him to, you know, to not be able to do that big now, by the way, do you know where Holtzman lists? I know where's he live?

Speaker 6:          01:22:02       Yeah. Isn't it like Vietnam or something? Not Marina del Rey. No, I heard he, he moved to Vietnam right now. Yeah. Holtzman when he just did someone's podcast. We're like, oh yeah, I think he was on [inaudible] sometimes those go to Thailand. Thailand. That's what it is. He was Chinaman hairless boy there. He said, oh, he always Joe. I mean, he's just a kid. He's a joke. He's a great guy. I love that. Back up the joke. Just say it. It's okay. That's what I mean. Everybody, you know. Um, so you both have a joke about old people coming. Terrible. Not like that. Yeah. Well it's been done. Yeah. Yeah. It makes sense to do it. And it's funny. Yeah. And it only happened because there was like an old male and I was picking on one night and I just went into it and every once in a while he'd just bring it up.

Speaker 3:          01:22:48       How many great songs are written about the same subjects, you know, how many great sub the songs, you know, cover, uh, you know, really was real similar ground. Be Still fucking love them cause they're great, you know, and, and in comedy there's certain things sacs especially is the, which is always going to be hilarious. It just is. And as, as it is, let's extract as much of it out as we can. You think we'd be overlapping a lot if we did shows? I don't think so. No, we different, we have a different point of view though. No, I agree. I saw and just watched Joe a couple of months ago at the Ice House and I think it would be great. I don't think that last night, I mean seeing your show was so fun, but you're so much more preposterous to me. I just, I tried to be a little more realistic because you actually have facts in that I can try to remember. I don't want to be a an agent of disinformation. Yes. You fucking act was so funny and describing how the caves were created.

Speaker 3:          01:23:41       I would not, I would not, but I just want to say that we were slapping the table. We were fucking hell. And me and Norton and we were looking over it, the laughing, it was such a special moment, like as comics, you know, as professionals who've been comics for 20 plus years, the both of us, we were laughing together. Like, you know, it was like there's a brotherhood and that's the best compliment. I don't get along with most comics. I don't think you do what you, the, you know what I mean? I get along with a lot of comics, you know, I give you credit. The ones that I don't get along with, it gets got ugly. No, no, I know that. But I'm saying I just don't because I don't feel camaraderie. So when I'm around the few that I do love, you know, and you'll one of them now obviously, and you know Norton for years and Florentine. I think in your defense, I think in your defense you got so fucking big so quick that it's real hard for you to relate to other people. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          01:24:38       comedy. You know when, when somebody comes with me and then my comics mean not about the comedy, I'm in comics, I'm saying your, you became so fucking huge so quick. There's like this automatic resentment that's going to come with it with a lot of people. You went from being a comic who you know was in with others. You know, there's steady stream of professional comics to becoming the biggest comic in the history of standup comedy insider a few years and it just went boom, and all of a sudden you're doing evidence. But 27 years, it was 10 years. I'm sure it was a long time and I'm sure it was hard, but it also the, the, the, the height hit so high that it was impossible for people to not get jealous. I've watched a lot of people get creepy. I was able to talk to you.

Speaker 3:          01:25:27       I'm not a jealous person. Okay. That's what I mean. And Oh listen, I am honored to be around people like you and honored to be around people like Don. My rare I am. I don't care how long I've been doing comedy or how I'm confident that I know how to do it, but I am always like, uh, honored to be friends with Doug. Stan hope. I love that I can call up Stan, who I believe is one of the greatest comedians of all time. I can call them up and we'll shoot the shit on the phone and we'd love it. And Stan Hope said to me the other day, he goes, you know what? I could quit comedy, but I can never quit comics. He goes, I could never quit. He goes, I fucking hang out with, I've tried to hang out with too many regular people. I can't fucking do it.

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       Well, that is, that is the fun part because we're all twisted in all different ways. Joey Diaz is different than you. Even if I text you late at night, I know you getting the texts cause you're up. Yeah. Yeah. You take at four in the morning. Let me tell you something. Cool wheels like one 30 in the morning and he goes and I got to get some sleep cause I got to get up. I'm like, you're a comic. He's also a chef de time pool has. But I'm saying Jake time it is. I agree. You know what I mean? I love, I love the night. That's what I am. I am exactly the same way. That's when I do all my work. I don't, I don't get anything done during the day. My kids are up. They want to play. There's, you know, fucking something's going on. There's noise.

Speaker 3:          01:26:44       I can't concentrate in my office during the day. I play with my kids, I get my workouts in, I do my bullshit. But then when everyone's asleep, I do it after Jujitsu. So I like to write, I don't even come home till 11 and then from 11 on, that's when I start to write saying if a call it three you pick it up. Oh yeah. That's when I called Opie and Anthony [inaudible]. Anthony, I only call when I'm awake. I'm awake all night, which I need to do more often. I, I fucking love those guys and hanging out with Anthony and when we were in Vegas, he just really reinforced how great he is. I always know he's a great guy, but I'd love the fact that we could all pal around in a social setting. Oh, he's a brilliant, brilliant oppression. It's a lot of people don't realize is there's a lot of really good impression.

Speaker 3:          01:27:26       He's another guy always tell, why aren't you doing stand up? Well, he sort of is. When he does the, have you seen his fucking awesome show his show. Let me do this. Let me just give him credit. This is the reason why we're doing this podcast today. It's because the Anthony Kumina mia from the opiate Anthony Show, because Anthony Kumi has started doing his own show called live from the compound and live from the compound, which he does on Ustream. He does it in his house. He has a fucking studio set up. He spent like a quarter million dollars with fucking green screens and he could be like in front of the Colosseum in Rome. He couldn't be in space. It could be any professional desk. And you know, he used to do with these chicks he was dating. He would be running around with a machine gun. It's singing songs, playing air guitar with holding a fucking [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          01:28:12       He's crazy. He's a beautiful person. Can love him. He's a gambling addict. He's crazy. He's nuts. I love Anthony. He loves to drink. He's a up to me. He's a classic American character and I don't get to kick. I don't have to hang out with them enough. So then all of a sudden we were in Vegas together and steaks we went to Wa craftsteak and had the most read the fucking one thing about Vegas. They know how to make them. Oh, bass cliff stakes. Craftsteak is an MGM. Oh, it's got damn good. Oh the best though. The best is nine nine steak house in the palm. You can't fuck with that place. You get the grass fed rib eye do not pass. Go. You want the grass fed rib by medium rare, it will knock your Dick into the dirt. It's the most spectacular cut of meat available in the, probably in the entire western part of the United States.

Speaker 3:          01:29:04       That nine steakhouse, nine steak house in Vegas and the point there, k a lot, so we went to crab steak. Yeah, I've been there too. Okay, that's great. We went to crab steak. We had a great meal. We had some wine. Anthony was like, he knows wine, so he picked out a good wine. It was me and my, my buddy Steve, who I've known since I was like 15 it was all of us as big group who came to see you. It was such a thrill. It was so fun to just see a show. Why didn't I get to go, Joe, you what? Puff. Oh Man. Oh

Speaker 3:          01:29:36       Hey. We had such a great time. We walked in right when Max was playing. We walked in and how great Max was having a guitar solo or excuse me, a drum solo. You know you, you know what? You got to talk to them about that for a minute because drum solo was fucking spectacular. Serious hand eye coordination, son, you went off that was like real shit. You didn't like have like a halfass drum solo. You were fucking fly in a man. The kid was flying. Unbelievable. It's what he needs to hear now because you know you can do that shit. That's them. We get to here at the Improv. Did we get to hear it?

Speaker 8:          01:30:14       Wow down. Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:31:40       You need to see that someone, someone please edit that and put that little part of this video on youtube. You have to see that with him watching it in the corner. He's walking around in the house going, I think, you know, cause don't forget it, showtime. You know what I mean? And this is the band's first shot ever. Yeah. You know, doing the song you saw could outlaw and he's gone. I don't know if the Solos they yet, and I'm trying to explain every night we'd sit outside the house and I go, Max, there is nothing you have to learn for this solo because you have such chops. Like I, you know, I started out as a drummer, but my ability, it doesn't come close to what he can do that. So yeah, I get jealous of his feet. All the combinations.

Speaker 3:          01:32:25       No, because because he's, he uses both his feet like his hand, he drive a stick shift. It's automatic. Automatic. I feel it. God knows how to work the pedals like that would want to fucking stick shifts. No, no. He's just amazing. And like when I would tell people about him, you know, I'm the farthest, so they think, well how good can they really be? And then you see that which, which we got to see it. You got to see, it's like babysit. Yeah. You got to listen. You're listening to it folks. You, if you're hearing just the audio version of this podcast, it's like a, it's an iPhone camera. So the, the sound quality is not the best. You have to see it. If you see it, it's fucking propositive. When he would, when he would show me like drum Solos Chicago, like I said at the Arcadia, right.

Speaker 3:          01:33:10       Arcadia theater in Chicago. Well, I'm going to be 22 and uh, with the, so I actually started off only soloing when I first started playing the drums. I didn't play with a band for like the first five, six years of drumming he's playing since he's 10. And how old are you now going to be 22 you're going to be 22 she'd been playing the drums for 12 years. Dude, your fucking hands are ridiculously fast. You should get involved in wing Chung. You should start coming through and mother fuckers that fast speed. He could probably be a hell of a bargain. Talk. Believe it translates number one. He can box. I'm embarrassed to say he, he, he, no, by accident he sorta knocked me out twice because when I would, you know, teach them to box, you know, I would say, you know, we've got an that Hollywood gym that had his love, that place.

Speaker 3:          01:33:59       I would say, all right, no head shots at all. So I would just protect my body and let them fight me, both kid. So now and then Max would slip and he'd nailed me right on the chin once it happened in my backyard and I went right down. Because you know when you hit in the chin, you see the stars and you've got down. I'm not expecting to get punched in the face by my friend unless you yeah, by my son. And then he does it again at the gym and I'm on the floor feeling like an asshole because here I am, I'm the father and my 14 year old just knocked me out. Well, you know, the reality is there's a lot of chicks that can knock you out if they don't know. If you don't know the punch in you, if you don't know they're going to punch you.

Speaker 3:          01:34:37       There's a great video of a chick headbutting a guy on conscious, some asshole at a bar says something stupid toy. She grabs his shirt, goes bang, knocked some completely unconscious, and that does work. That doesn't work. Let me tell you, he hit me with his fist. I'm saying a little girl can headbutt a jet giant dude. What I'm saying is if you don't know it's coming, if you get hit in the jaw, you can get, that's even by a little girl's head. Well that's what I tried to break the body down first and then they go for the chin. It's not a bad because people, when they see a professional fight they go, why aren't they just swinging it up? They don't realize it's a skill. It's a dance. It's, you'd be amazed at how hard it is to hit someone. Did you ever do an actual box and kickbox I did a lot of boxing in the gym but I have three kickboxing fights.

Speaker 3:          01:35:19       But it, you'd be amazed at how difficult it is to actually hit someone who knows how to box. It's, it's a dance. It's a rhythm. You got to figure out how to fucking, how to fake them, how to get them to move out, when to run and cause if you run in like if you see Ryan Bader versus Leo Machida, the Oda Cheetahs is bad ass karate guy and he'd knocked Ryan Bader out cause Bader charge them. They just caught them charging and flatten them, knocked them out with one punch, but you, that's the risk you take. If you want to be aggressive, it's so hard to hit someone who actually knows how to fight. It's riddance. You will feel if you were like, there's a lot of people that always bothers me. Peterson Center fight. He's a great guy to level. Want to know more about boxing? They should get in touch with me. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          01:36:01       we don't dice clay on Twitter. Is that my Twitter things? Real dice clay. If you want to know about drumming, met Max does comedy and if you want to go out with Eleanor Max, did you get upset when you dropped your dad? I was a, I was nervous. You know, I came over like, you know, are you okay? I didn't mean to do it. Oh yeah, he show you didn't mean it, but it was thinking about maybe that it was major. We have a great relationship, you know, you know well that means probably got a good punch. Look, if you hit the drum set hard, I bet you can generate some serious fucking speed. If somebody teaches mechanics, oh, you can't hit your kids. That's ridiculous. You know, I'm just handing you over to rogue and for all your fights, thinking about taking some crop McGaugh so chroma guys good.

Speaker 3:          01:36:50       Yeah, it's interesting, you know, but uh, there's uh, but he knows miss a lot of benefits to taking one martial art over a common atory system of martial arts. Like a lot of people think the common atory systems like [inaudible] or something like that is good if you don't, we do it every now and then. You just want to learn some self defense. But I think there's a lot of time spent doing shit like street techniques and stuff like that. That's really not really coming up. No, I don't think you do. You really don't want to know. You really want to know. We really want to be good at what works on trained killers, not people in the street with a fucking set of keys. Because in a real life situation, there's going to be a lot of craziness going on. You gotta be able to execute from memory and from training and how much training are you really have taken?

Speaker 3:          01:37:31       Someone's going away. I mean, are you really good at, I mean, maybe it's a good thing to know if you're in the special forces or something and you got to learn, you know, dealing with people with hand guns all the time. But the reality of self defense is most of the times when things happen, they happen one because one person's not confident, so the other person gets cocky. And two, because you're not aware of your environment and you don't have enough confidence in any one particular discipline, whether it's stand up or the ground fighting or anything like that. A lot of people want to fight and they don't know how fight. And it scares

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       the shit out of me. I've been a martial artist my whole life. The last thing I want to do is get in a fight with somebody because I know there's some people that can do some crazy shit to your body. Yeah, okay. I know them. I know people who could eat. You would be crazy to fight them. Yeah, but people start fights with them because there's a lot of fucking morons out there, but I want to, for me, it's very important that I'm the one who is capable of deciding where everything goes. I don't like being in a position where I have to trust my health to some crazy asshole, you know? I don't like that. I don't like the to know that some guy could just own me anytime. He wants to just jump all over me and I don't know what to do and I can't even defend myself. I can't live like that. That would drive me crazy. I know too many crazy people, you know? I grew up with too many complete fucking psychopaths to ever think that it's safe to not know how to defend yourself.

Speaker 6:          01:38:43       Yeah, I agree with that. Yeah. It's like if you, I know how to defend myself. Oh, I know you said mock wrestling matches in the backseat. Nearly beat up people at shows that's ever get some, some situations like what is this one girl we went to, we went out to this club and normally it's a Sunday night. You remember this? It was a Sunday night and it's usually dead. Andrew's like, oh, I always go here. It's usually like a hundred people. It's not that bad. We get there. There was some kind of dead mouse DJ thing going on. Okay. There was like 1500 people. Yeah. Ran Pack. And I go, here's where we can't go in here. And he goes, no, we'll be fine. We'll be fine. Girls were throwing themselves at him.

Speaker 3:          01:39:25       Nice. That must be nice. Yeah, it feels good. But you know how fast did I take that girl off? Yeah. Yeah. But how does she does she does security when we go out? Yeah. He gets crazy. He goes crazy. Yeah. No, it feels good. But you know what? It's, you know, it's, it's nothing I'm looking for, you know what I mean? No, I'm serious. Even when I'm single. You know what I mean? It's nothing that's ever thrilled me unless I'm out hunting, I believe, but that's strolling into a club. Fill with 1500 people with those sunglasses on and a sleeveless shirt and, and the throwing themselves out. You'll come on, sorry. You're in a goddamn movie, you're going to Goddamn man. I appreciate it cause sometimes it does hit me in that way. What do you get to live that life? But I really appreciate your famous guy.

Speaker 3:          01:40:12       You've got to clubs, you go out. I mostly do shows after shows. I it's, it's hard to go places, you know, it's, it's, it's very rare that he does it. But you know what, I like to dance with my wife sometimes, you know, and you know, I'm very focused on her when I go out because they see all the, I'm watching the guys watching her. But when you do allow you to have a problem with like people constantly wanting to get your attention to take photos. Like they never give me just, they normally put me in one of those VIP booths. She stands there with her arms out, like touching the boots. Like she's just hanging out and she won't let anybody put big, this was funny when we went out a Halloween, then we went to

Speaker 4:          01:40:54       the same club. I think a true, but that was later and they had, I'm dancing with my wife on the dance floor and you've got these three giants, these three guys surrounding us so we can dance. So people didn't bother me, you know, and you just have to ignore it and you get into the person you with. We went to this crazy place first. There was one that was like 10,000 people at that first place. Yeah, we saw a fight. This shit. We saw a lot of fights there. We went to, that's when I felt, oh you want to hear what's the finish fetish ball. That's right Max. If people thought he was dressed as Andrew dice clay and they were like funny where I had a hit somebody, you could tell it, I don't remember the name of the hotel or where we were. It was the south, something down near the hotel around the south coast. Oh No. But we were walking out and we're walking fast because people are recognizing them a thinking. He's just stressed. And when people yell my name, I'm not him, I just keep going. Right. So all of a sudden this guy, me and Valerie were in heels, so he was walking fast, like 30 feet behind me, a little bit ahead of us. So I hear this guy go dice, dice and I'm like, Oh shit.

Speaker 4:          01:42:09       And he comes over and I, I we wreck. No, like don't touch me. You know, he touched him like this and he knocked him the fuck out. It was his friend brand. It's a friend of mine, but I didn't see him coming and I just felt no, I didn't see him and his hands grabbed my shoulder so I just react and I hit him, you know, because that's where the gloves are off once you put your hands on me. Hard like that. But he's my friend, but they're yelling. No, if he was yelling Andrew, I wasn't just look Brandon, but he couldn't, I didn't know. It's my friend and I turned and he's going back and he's out on his feet, you know, cause I do know how to hit, you know, in that way. Right. Brandon's punch him in the head, but it was, but I hit him with a side punch.

Speaker 4:          01:42:53       I didn't hit her. I was turning to hit him again. And that's when I saw was and I felt so bad. And to this day he won't admit that he was out. It's just funny, you know, I'm like, Shit. I'm like, Yo, I, you know, how do you yell my name? You know, you don't yell my name. That's like, you don't say dice. You say Andrew, you know, cause it, it's like a drunk gut. This is what I'm picking up weight, Joe. This is what I'm picking up. I'm hearing a guy yell, dice, dice, and all of a sudden I feel this two hands grabbing revenue like that. So I just fucking bang the guy and he's gotten, now I'm turning around to really finish them because once, and I'm sure you know you would react the same as somebody's got to be careful. Just grabbing you can do that. You never know if I, if I feel someone grabbing me from behind, I feel like they're up to nefarious things. Well you grab me. I gotta do to make, you know, that's the one thing I don't have in place. What, what? Sorry.

Speaker 3:          01:43:52       Sorry. Okay. It's all right. Yeah, it's crazy that someone would, why wouldn't he just, we'll just touch us. He was, he was, hey buddy, you don't understand. He was drinking so he got excited when he saw the Commodore Hotel did 30 feet behind me. Fucking problem. The drunks. That is a problem with people that don't even realize that it might take you a lot of the shows, they don't even realize they're being ridiculous. It's a terrible drug for, for socializing. It's the best jug for socializing, but it requires character. But there's so many people don't have character and they go out and they drink and they're real shitbag personality comes flying out. Hey look, if you come over to me for a picture and you're not drunk and you're nice, I'll take, I'll take a dozen of them. What do you do though? If you're on your way to somewhere and you just said is a river of people and you can't get thrown. Well if it, if it's nice people, I'll take the shots. But if they're assholes, they put their hands on me. I don't have a fuse, I just don't have a fuse and I won't deal with it.

Speaker 6:          01:44:45       He did something cool. Uh, last Sunday at our show in Vegas, he, uh, some guy, he was coming up the elevator and he was kind of late and the guy was like, hey man, I saw you at Madison Square. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:44:54       This guy went to both shows at the garden when I was still alive. And he was, and I was in a rush.

Speaker 6:          01:44:59       Say it. Wow was after his Doring his shell, like at the end of it he goes, who's the guy in the elevator? And the guy was like, that was me any talking about on stage and took it.

Speaker 3:          01:45:07       I took him on the stage. He was so excited that like a Chinaman to take the pictures. Cause I know they make the cameras, you know what I mean? Oh No, no, they do, they know what they're doing with it, you know, and they were right in front of me and I actually dedicated like my, my Asian obit to them, you know, cause they were dead center. That's beautiful. I don't know what they knew what they were getting, but they were cool about it, you know. And I, I gave him some suggestions for, for new phones and um, but I brought the guy up from the crowd because I was in a rush. I was late for the show, so I'm going, who's the guy that was at the God and stand up, you know, that's very cool. Come on up. Let's take a couple pictures.

Speaker 3:          01:45:49       And of course I had fun with them, but we do our show. I felt bad that I had a blow him off when I was coming up the stairs. You know, we do our shows and then we hang on after the show and take pictures with everybody. But if I'm on a rush to get somewhere that's that's, that's when it becomes a problem like in Vegas, like after the UFC is it becomes a real problem because there'll be a thousand people waiting in line. I'm like, folks, I can, I got gotta go, I'm a meeting my friend and then they got the ones and they get pissed off and be like, yeah, I wrote something about me on Facebook. See where we're at today. Concern yourself because no, I mean a guy and I don't like, I don't like to blow somebody off if they're legitimately happy to see me.

Speaker 3:          01:46:23       No, but you know what a thousand people you see, it's really fucking hard when somebody goes dice where you'd take a picture and all of a sudden the friend standing, I go, well how long does it take to take? Oh, oh, it was on the filming by accident. That's what I got pictures over. You know what I mean? Get the fuck Outta here. You know what I mean? You look at their fans, I don't give a fuck who they are if you want to get it right. Take a picture. No, they do it on purpose. We do the filming. Yeah. Cause you know and then,

Speaker 5:          01:46:50       oh they have more time. We know. You know how many t no, to get their little piece of fucking footage. I can't take it with the phones no more.

Speaker 6:          01:46:56       The guy puts it on the low online all the time, right?

Speaker 5:          01:46:59       Yeah. It's like, you know what? Take the picture. It's a nice man. I get it, but don't start with being Scorsese and doing a fucking feature film with me. The guy got,

Speaker 6:          01:47:08       he was like, you don't want you, you don't want to be up on youtube. I'm like, not by, you got no luck in this whole human being. Me and Valerie. And he was like, and he would put it up. This is dice his wife. Oh Geez. Well creepy. You know what it like when you were in the public eye. I try

Speaker 5:          01:47:23       to be as cool as I can with people. But then you get the ASL when you're doing, like I, I really refused to do most meet and greets because there's always going to be the guy that wants to put me in a headlock. Yeah. And he's always going to regret it. And I don't care who it is. Why did the dude's like to do that? Because you know, like, look, you can add are a guy like me. You got an attitude about yourself. You've got a tough image about yourself. So they want to challenge you in front of their check. If they get to meet you instead of being cool and taking the picture, they want to out macho you. And that's where, and I don't care who it is, I don't care if he's fucking Zillow. You're going to pay the price for that.

Speaker 5:          01:48:00       And right in front of you checked. I don't care if I am Babish you, I don't care how big you are. I have no fucking fear of it. How many times you've been in fist fights because of that? Uh, I, I've, I've had enough problems. I've been sued enough and you know, but now that those things are pass me, I could move on to the next group of fights. It is hot. It is hard to, to just see. I used to run around. That's why I would laugh when I would see you like flipping out on people cause some going, thank God there's somebody else in the business that has no fucking patience for these assholes and this is a guy that'll follow people out and go home with them and argue with them. Loved that about, because I didn't know you the way I came to know you.

Speaker 5:          01:48:42       I'm coming in the comedy store one night and I hear that from the mic and the stage just guide. Just you were bearing someone, you weren't doing a bit, you will on somebody that you just didn't like. It was, it was Joe Rogan mean. Oh. And I just loved it seeing somebody get fucking buried, you know, cause you weren't trying to be clever. You weren't trying to be funny at that part. You wanted to dismantle this person piece by fucking piece. And I was just so happy and enjoyed it. Like I was hearing the funniest stuff ever. And then when you were done, you got back into the act and you kept screaming about whatever you with, you know your bits and about, you know, you know fucking this chick and you know, and and I enjoyed that too. But to walk into a place and just see somebody so fucking angry and I never met you. I never saw you on stage. And this was my first experience with you that I had to sit down and watch and just laugh. Oh thank going. This guy is just enjoying destroying this guy with his and,

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       and I knew the guy deserved it. Well there were so many ass cause he was fuck you too. That was his big comeback. They had fucked me too. You want to tell me that outside? You mother fucker. You want to be a big shot. You went into the whole fucking thing and I was like, oh what a breath of fresh air. There was no one that would monitor the room, the condo. But we're responsible and it's one of the reasons why we all became so strong, you know, because you have no protection in me and Brent Ernst and Sam Aaa, we did this gig. It's always my dad.

Speaker 3:          01:50:21       We did this Gig and a Africa earns, gets off stage, you have to crush. And he looks at me, goes comedy store motherfucker. And I was like, yeah dude. You know, it's like that was a gym for us where, and there was so many clients, that place is a magnet for Douche bag guys, Tom and yell out and try to disrupt the act. And that's what dean of DRM on thought it was okay to heckle, you know, you know what I love with aren't the uh, W W who is he? Joey, his brother. No, no dog. Tony, Tony, Tony, Tony.

Speaker 5:          01:50:59       I want sweat. I made Bret go on one night. I go, you don't understand. It's not when you actually start the rollers skating part. It's, you have to explain to the audience who Tony really is. You got to get into his life more. Just, Gosh, you're on stage. You can't be afraid to expand on Tony's life before you actually show them what he does at the roller skating rink. Right. You've got to talk about his history, his family, you know, his likes, his dislikes, what makes him happy. So kind of bumps. Rhett goes on one night and gets into Tony's whole life that the crowd is like, cause this is my type of humor that people are looking like, who the fuck is this guy? He's talking and then he goes into the bid of Tony Roller Skating. But it was 20 minutes before we got to the actual rovers before the music kicks in before anything.

Speaker 3:          01:51:52       It's a great payoff though. I mean we all know every Tony, you know and Brent Arts is such a good guy. We were working together at the Improv and he goes, Hey, do you want me to not do that? Bit like, I was like, why would I didn't want you to not do the best bet? He goes, because I don't know, it's a real strong bed. I mean maybe you don't want to follow that. And I go, oh please, I want you to be as funny as he can be. I enjoy that. That's what it's about. But that's a, it's a weird thing where someone for whatever reason think people, people want to equate filth. People want to acquaint other people's success with somehow or another that takes away from you. And I think that's crazy. It's a weird disease that people have where you want to be.

Speaker 3:          01:52:31       The only person funny on the show and you know, and I know that there's a lot of comics that brings up guys on the road with them and they stack the deck. They put terrible comedians up, which is really not just rude to their audience members. It's rude, but it's also like, so like the prodigious, I know guys who bring up guys and there was a national headliners do big places and they bring up guys who shouldn't be allowed to ever do comedy. I mean you watch his poor audience get assaulted with nonsense, with nonsense in the, the fucking, the, the rhythm of a comic.

Speaker 5:          01:53:02       Well see what I like to do, like when Norman was with me, a lot of times I would also, Steve Simone just working for me, you know, like road stuff. So I remember when we were doing the, um, uh, Venetian, okay. Some almost in booked, there's a comic, you know, I had Norton tope and for me not and strong, so, you know, we'd just backstage and we're gonna start the show and that's when I look at Simone and I go, you're on deck. He goes, when he talks, I got to go out and do your thing now because I wouldn't want them thinking about the act that they have. I just want them instantly to walk out and do that. I did it to Max to when he was younger. Yeah. And you know, cause you know, you got the guy coming on before you that's going to kill. So I like to take a newer guy, you know, to, to sort of train him in comedy and a guy that really has his shit together that I'm back there going, okay, you got to amp up. He's killing. You know, like when Eleanor goes up, I know if the crowd is okay, I know if they suck, I know if they're great, but the response she's getting because she's top notch. Right. You know what I mean? So when she goes out there, I know her stuff kills. So if they're just,

Speaker 3:          01:54:06       ha ha. I'm like, all right, another shit crowd. You know what I mean? So you've got to really be able to, to know your audience before you get out there. And the only way to do it is to have an, an unbelievably strong opener. Because if you have somebody week, if you have somebody weak, you can't judge the crowd by them because they're new. Right. You know what I mean? Yeah. Having a strong open is very important. It, yeah, exactly. The whole show, the people that don't do that are so silly. It's so dumb. It's a, it's a weakness. It doesn't make you look better. So she better be strong in Chicago. I'll tell Ya, through Brian onstage, we, through Brian Red Band on stage in the biggest crowd he'd ever seen and it later was Redmond, right? Bam.

Speaker 3:          01:54:52       Redmans and normal name. No Red Ban. Red Band. No, no. I get it now, but I, I've been calling them red man and he didn't correct him. Whenever you want it to be we through. No, no. I don't want it to be with he loves you. I want it to be what you need his name. Tell right now. We're going to make it red with some money. Find Red on Joey Jay, my new buddy. Double J. Double j Rogan and what? Jay Rogan, my new shit. Double J GCG Oh shit. On the road. Double J. Picture what? What, what you think I need to get some sort of a diamond chain, some sort of platinum and then two J's together. Double J. Strong nicknames and just take pictures like this. I've been thinking about it on a constant bit cause every time I call you I'm gone. He's going to have a nickname now.

Speaker 3:          01:55:34       He's got to have one. I got to find out the middle name. Everybody has nicknames so Brian would tumble is a cool name. It's a good but only by your friends, by your friends. You don't let go. Just pull your double Jane. If it becomes that big, you'll have no chickens too late. I think you just started a revolution. No, double j is a great name. Macom juicy for short. Thanks Sweetie. You know what I mean? So it's a cool name for you. I like it. The dice man coming to Saint Charles, Illinois dice clay show time special at the Arcadia theater on Saturday, August 25th. If you're in Chicago, you need to go and check this shit out. If you're not in Chicago, need to get on a fucking plane and go and check this shit out. And if you go to oh shows o s h o w s.com or you can call the theater. The number for the theater is (630) 962-7000. I'll say it again. (630) 962-7000. That's not hard to remember. Bitch, relax. And uh, the people who are listening. So, uh, this is your first special and 17 fucking years. Do you have a new name for it? The special, is it, have you named it yet? Yeah, I have.

Speaker 3:          01:56:43       Is going to be surprised. No, it's exciting. You don't know the name of the special. You're with me. I know, but it's called dice and destructible in destructive. Change it back. No, don't talk about it. Don't talk about them a name. There's no reason.

Speaker 5:          01:56:57       Because that's the name. What if you had like a Twitter contest to say like, you know what the name would be? Well you know we could do it. All right. So on the real dice clay, send me what you think. Even though I'm going to use what I already know and what are the, I don't know what they come up with. Well let me hear it. Let me hear what they've got. This unbelievable, you know, list. It's pretty fucking good. Indestructable cause I feel I've been through a lot. I feel my fans have been through a lot, you know, so, so I really, and this show is such a rock and roll vibe, you know, I really want to create what I would call, you know, the most exciting, standup special I've ever done. That's what I want to give people. How was it for you to go through all that

Speaker 3:          01:57:43       censorship stuff when MTV banned you? Because you were talking about Feminine Hygiene Products? I mean it was so, oh,

Speaker 5:          01:57:51       you know what it was when my career took off, like for the first 10 years when I was, when I was just doing the clubs around the country and honing my act and I would get write ups from local papers. They would write me up like in newspapers, like the hoodlum of Uma, things like that. Like it was all, it was all positive stuff. And then they'd write about the act. The the day after my Hbo Special Ed, the dice man cometh the La, the New York Times put the headline, the demise of Western civilization. See, I never know, but they ripped off. They ripped the whole show apart and I wasn't prepared for it because as I was coming up as a comic, I wasn't thinking I want to be a controversial comic. Yeah. I wasn't even thinking, I just did the act I wanted to do. So it was like almost like getting a, you know, a sucker punch.

Speaker 5:          01:58:39       I didn't see it common. So when all that media backlash happened, I was like, don't they get, I'm just a comic, I'm not running for office here. I'm a common, well there was something that you felt like you were being hateful. It was like, no, it's just towards foreigners. And you know, there was, there was moments where people are just really overreacting. And I was like, how come that's okay in rap music or it's okay. And that all came after it. See all that heavy rap, all the shows like South Park, all the controversial show came after me. So now that I survived all that, when I went through it was that I stopped live crew. What's at the same time? Yeah, it was around the same, because I remember you be connected to that and all arguments about it. So you know how many rap songs I'm in.

Speaker 5:          01:59:25       Yeah. I mean, even the song by that one, EMS permission for that or do I let them sample me because they called my office and said Dev writing a song about me did defending me, you know, so we allowed them to sample, you know, and that song they wanted me to present them with, they won for best song of the year with MTV and they wanted me to be the presenter and still MTV when let me on it. They still have a, did they let it go now? Yeah, they unbanned me last year when I did on Turo stupid. I understand what happened because when I went on MTV and did what I did, you know, it was at a time when nobody did that and there was no beeping. You know, even my manager at the time, Sandy Gallin called me up and said, I thought that was just on my television.

Speaker 5:          02:00:21       Like he couldn't believe the language, you know, and the banding for life was one of the greatest things that ever happened to me. You know, I went from, you know, from doing one show at a 20,000 seat arena to three shows that weekend. You know, and I was like, I don't give a fuck. I'm not a singer. Not Today, not today. You don't need them anymore. They're not as important. You doing the tonight show is not nearly as impactful as you do in a podcast. That's sounding, I'll never have to worry about if you did the APP show, it would have more because fucking Shane Dilia head, another comic that won't put on any comics that'll shine that chandelier big fuck. You know what, you know I, you know, I never did let them in either, but I don't have anything against him. I think he's great at a show.

Speaker 5:          02:01:10       But Leno was always the type. Like I talk about the comics that on like he was never a type to want to help his fellow comics. So that's why when he brings a comic on, they don't become superstars because number one, a lot of them don't even have the chops to be on a show like that yet. So they'll do okay. Well he does to help Norton and nortons an exception, not as an exception, you know, and he does a lot of on the street stuff. And northern became a star before we ever went online. All right. But Leno doesn't look to hey sit down like Johnny would do what you're saying. So he doesn't create stars. He doesn't, he's not looking to, he only gives that this fucking guy only cares about him. Trust me on that. If you really stop and think about that.

Speaker 5:          02:01:51       If you are a comic and you do have a show where you occasionally I've comics on what do you want like to promote all your friends? No, he doesn't give a fuck. You do it. Let me tell you something. No one knew me for years when, uh, when I was struggling and he was already a big comic. He was already cold hosting costs in. And when my career took off, he would bad mouth me to newspapers. And I got hold of this fucking bold ahead and the Improv. And I said, trust me, when I tell you this next time I won't be talking to you. You won't even see me coming if you ever open your fucking mouth. I love that expression. And he goes to me when I said it goes with his stupid voice. You know what I had pitched, I can't even do this asshole.

Speaker 5:          02:02:30       Yeah, he goes, he goes, we weren't really expecting to become the stars that we, and I got, let me tell you something. Maybe you weren't expecting to become a big time guy, but I knew exactly where the fuck I was going. You know? And it's guys like that that I don't like because they really don't look to help. Even the guys they bring on, well he just filling those five minutes like he's supposed to. He's always been friendly to me when I'm done to show. So I can't say anything bad about the guy but the hump and I, it's okay that you're like, just like, I don't know. When was the last time you did an Leno shot? I did it like a year ago. Maybe a, yeah. When, when fear factors back on, I did it with Ron Paul, but a guy like you who's had series, you know, if the series, fear fact they've been on the road, want to go on?

Speaker 5:          02:03:14       Well maybe that's the way your friends, yeah, I'm not asking you to go on it. Yeah, I know my son just sky anything. The last time I saw him I was doing this, uh, I was hosting this late night show with Judd Nelson for one day and all of a sudden somebody comes over and he goes, uh, Leno wants to say hello. And this was at, they had a fight with him years earlier. So I go over to the set, you know, and he's standing on the stage, no one's there, and I'm just bullshit. When am I go? So when are we doing the show? And he goes, we need to set it up. And I go, well, let's set it up. It's only been 20 years, you know, and uh, he goes, no, we're going to do it. And of course it never happened. I'm like, what?

Speaker 5:          02:03:49       This is so want me to see him on his set, you know, like I get it, you're hosting a fucking talk show. That to me is old fucking hat. You know what I mean? And that's just how I feel about. And when you don't help your fellow comics and you're in a position like, like Carson was years ago, when he'd bring a comic on, he would fucking, he was so confident about who he was, right? He was just so confident that when he bring on a Rodney or, uh, or any new comic, you know, he wanted you to shoot the guy. If the guy shines, come on over, sit down, and he'd let them shine even more. It wasn't like, oh, I'm giving them too much time away from it. You run the show every night for 90 fucking minutes. Give a guy five minutes to make it, you know what I mean? And that's where Leno in him, a two different men, because you know, let them and does it. He

Speaker 3:          02:04:38       brings on the guys, um, uh, uh, Kimmel does it. They all do it. You know, I think there's a few guys that know, first of all, they get how few slots there are and how much competition there is and no one's more aware of that than Jay. Jay is interested in buying this next old Volkswagen and making it look like a hot rock. Those old code, I won't bad mouth them because you a friend of hers, so I'm going to let it go. He's always been nice to me on the shots. Exactly. So I should have never, I didn't grow up with them. I mean I didn't call Amy. I'll see him again. I'll tell him how you feel. Fucking he shook off real fucking jerk off. He doesn't have anything out there that you could buy. He's a comic, but it's hard to buy a Jay Leno CD. It's not like it comes out with new material. Well he does his show on the tonight show. Does that monologue and he doesn't shows outside, but he recycles the same act for the most part. Apparently he doesn't want to do a special because why don't we do I thank you. Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:05:35       You know like true. He doesn't, you know what I'm saying is he doesn't put out material, which is, which is odd. And I, his, his reasoning for it is that it would cost him money because he couldn't do that act anymore and you have to write a whole new act. I thought that was really odd. But he's known like when he was young, I like about Seinfeld because with, with all his fame and everything, he still gets out there and he does the stand up. Yeah. And as far as the cleaner guys, I would have to say he's just, well he's a master at that kind of just the best. But that stuff never makes me laugh as much as you're kind of stuff I don't want.

Speaker 3:          02:06:17       I see observational stuff and it's interesting. It's funny, but it's not ridiculous. But I go from what's behind close doors, these, you know, like Seinfeld. It's ridiculous. Some of it. Yeah. And I love, fantasy is beautiful. It's fun, it's silly. It's, your show is so silly. It's so fun. Like we had such a great fucking time. There's so much shit that you just say it all. And it's just so well with Norton when you were laughing at that particular bid. I know the bit, that's the stuff Norton and goes crazy for you because he knows that was absolutely no thought. There were no facts. But if flows grade, it's funny fucking you know that to me and I love Jerry Seinfeld thing. He's a great comedian. I think it was great as an actor on that show. But if I had a choice, she had seen him or you, I'd always see you.

Speaker 3:          02:07:09       I appreciate that kind of Hume Dam. Why? Because I know the kind of guy you want and I know that's why you would come see me cause you know I'm going to deliver what you need for your laughs. Yeah. I appreciate it as a, you know like at that forum, sorry I to look real pioneer. Uh, I'm sorry I didn't throw somebody out for you. Throw somebody out like within the first two minutes what happened right to the right. Your, your right, your lower right. There was a, a drunk asshole and you're like, oh this is not gonna work. I can tell you right now. This is not going to, was it a ketamine moment? Guy Was, the guy was hammer and he can remember he, when he got up and walked out, he couldn't even, he didn't know what the fuck was even happening. He was so drunk.

Speaker 3:          02:07:56       That's why I want him out. You know what I mean? Don't, don't try to help me up there. You couldn't have worked with that guy. I know certain guys that are just so hammered. There's nowhere. I calmed him down with the band coming out that he would be cool and they think it's a joke when I say I'm going to throw. Yeah, I'll give him a chance, you know? I'll always give him a go sit in the corner. What about tonight? I started going up the back of 30 seconds. Yeah. What about when it come to the back of the theater? When the guy got me mad, I walked out to go and look

Speaker 5:          02:08:25       the bike. I went afterwards. That was the guy in the back of the room. Would you do, there was a guy in the back of the room. Got On my nerves and get security out of this, get this Guy Outta here and nobody's coming. So I go, look, I'll throw you out personally, I don't care. I don't know what you look like. I don't know. I'm coming to get you. And I just went towards the back and, but at the time I was nearly there. They had security, Paul and the guy. Yeah. Oh my God. Oh, oh, you want to hit a burst? Oh, this is great. A couple weeks ago and met governors in Long Island and like, you know, now and then I get the real ass hole and there's a guy with dark glasses like me and he's fucking drunk and be an asshole. So I said, open your fucking mouth again and I'll throw you the fuck outta here.

Speaker 5:          02:09:11       Let's see what happens. You know? And the guy's just yelling. He don't even know what he's yelling. So, you know, they got tough guys working at governors, so they come to throw the guy out after the show. Don Jamison goes, you missed the greatest thing I ever saw at one of these shows. I go, what happened? He goes, you know the guy you threw out, he was blind. I go, what? He goes, not only was he blind, he was fighting for the guys here going fucking dice. I'll kick his fucking ass all day and talk to me like that. And these guys couldn't hold them down. They said he had like retarded strength, you know, and he's swinging his fucking stick at them. He's swinging the stick. I go, well, you know, it's not like he had a dog with him that I could know he's blind. All I know is was a drunk asshole and he got what was coming to them. You know what I mean? But you know, I would've liked to see that at least to get it on film. That's a great youtube piece that I did filming anything. Why didn't the guy take out his phone and fund them? Fighting him so he could put it on youtube. He didn't even see them coming to throw them out.

Speaker 3:          02:10:17       We're eventually all going to have those Google goggles on and you won't need a youtube or an eye on iPhone. It's going to, but we're going to film everything you see through your eyes. They're already, we're already working on it. Yeah. There's just no privacy. Google, there's Google goggles is legit, man. They, they put it on, it's got a little small lands in the corner. It's like you're a fucking terminator. It's like you have this readout. You can, you could get navigation photo. It's going to buy it. You could take photos. You're going to make video. You gonna be able to broadcast in shit out. What happened at fun? Well, what happened to progress and technological innovation. It's going to keep going and not going to stop it. If you want a car, you got to deal with the consequences that people want and time travel.

Speaker 3:          02:10:59       Okay. Because it's all comes from the same place. It all comes from people figuring out amazing shit. People figure it out. Amazing Shit and they never stopped. They will never fucking stop ever. And Google goggles is going to lead to Google contact lenses, which is going to lead to Google neural implants, which is going to lead to who knows what kind of fun to my retirement. I'm fucking luck getting those. Get some tests before you die. What the fuck you like about it? You know what I mean? You know she's a nice girl. Which all don't stuff your ass though. She's only shows your ass. Don't think that's what I'm saying. The dimensions you don't under. She's not built for big tits. She, she's, she's got plenty. You're right and a half feet wide. You're, you're eight inches. Eight and a half inches wide. If you measure with broad woman her depth and it just strikes me, man.

Speaker 3:          02:11:53       I'm telling you. Look at it. Have you seen with Kim Kardashian has done to her ass? I don't pay any. Apparently there's new video of it and some, some guy on youtube and said it looked like she was wearing a diaper filled with pudding. She's got another ass job. She's got her ass larger. No, no doubt. I don't know why she quit. She probably had a half a decent, well she only had one shot at, I mean, I don't mind the reality show. I mean fucking movie she made, she was on the money. Wouldn't it be great to watch her fuck one of those giant super athletes that she fucks the movies. Even that movie she did like nobody really talks about it enough. You know what I mean? Because she was a natural work. Great work. Right? She's a natural attention whore. No, but what I'm saying is why quit cinema now that you've got your TV show?

Speaker 3:          02:12:42       Well she thinks that that got her to the dance, but there's more money legitimately in commercials like for Skechers when you go to the airport and you want to go to put your fucking wallet in the band, you'll check this morning. I want to look at it. You got to, this is really, it's really strange. It's really strange. Watch. Look at her ass. But I mean it doesn't even look real like watch, watch when they, they're focused on it. Like what? Check it. Check it. Check it. Here we go. What's that? What the fuck that, what the fuck is that? She's wearing a diaper filled. We're putting back a little bit Brian Motion. She is listened. Shit. Don't, don't get me wrong. I'm not hating. Did this part is the boring part. You want to get past this? You want to go to the others? Yeah. Not this part.

Speaker 3:          02:13:30       From here on this is, this is where it gets crazy slow motion. Look what's going on there. What's that? That's not even real. That is not real man. She's doing something crazy because it doesn't match her ledge. She looks like the Penguin I in that Batman movie, dude, it's not real because her upper body's not changing. Her arms aren't changing. She's stuffing her ass like a Turkey. It's just craziness. It's absolute complete madness because the way she had a beautiful body to begin with, you know what it is. They get so affected that they can't do enough. Like when they blow up that lips like Betty boop. You know what I mean? They do that whole, you know what the fuck? That's sad. None of it works. The the lips don't work. Look, you want it for a young girl. Somebody that doesn't need this shit, but tits work.

Speaker 3:          02:14:13       It does work too, but she doesn't have the frame. It shouldn't do it. She'd get the frame. I probably would have already done it. I was a girl. I'd probably have giant tits. I'd probably a 38 double D's I fucked that. Had the biggest house in Bel Air. If I was a check, I wouldn't even think of work. We'll put little crutches in front of me and I'll walk like that. Wheeler's put some wheels. She always talks about it, but that's the 300 does snap them on their breasts, breasts or someone acceptable? I wouldn't ever, man would prefer natural breasts. Breasts are somewhat acceptable, but there's nothing that we're, the ass is wrong. It's wrong. Am doing something crazy, especially when a woman can have really nice legs just by working out. That's what we learned. I don't know about you, but you know what I mean. Check out this ass Katy Perry the other day and one of those water parks her. She lost her. Let me see here. Let me get to it. Right. Well, should you have image right here? She has big boobies.

Speaker 9:          02:15:21       How? Come on?

Speaker 3:          02:15:24       That's photo shops. No, it's not. There's, there's a lot of them. There's a lot. Yeah. There's a lot of photos. There's people just, I wouldn't fold her right out of the pool and look at,

Speaker 9:          02:15:34       nope,

Speaker 3:          02:15:35       you know what? This is where we think the same way make it. But first of all, I don't, I don't buy that. That just happened and she's out swimming with a bunch of fuckers. This is all it's about. It's a publicity stunt. That's right. They did it on purpose. They're trying to get more people to go see her movie. The box office returns probably weren't what they expected. So Pete, let's find out more about Katie out and now that we've seen her ass, here's their movie. Oh God, I'm not buying it. I love all of you know, I don't buy it, but I enjoy it. I do too. She's got a killer and master gas masks like that. I would want the world to said dip kid dick in and move on. Show everybody. Right. You stream new shoe stream. They'll pause you just showed was that to get fucking Russell Crowe, cause this is the new guy dipping his dick in and Oh, you know what I mean? All these filthy slobs that dead. His wife gave me a spray Tan. She has a film that day. Are you enjoying it? And she took a picture of me and put it on Facebook. I wasn't does all the hair and make up shit.

Speaker 3:          02:16:45       She's unbelievable. But she's just practices. They got the spray machine that it looks hilarious. She paints you orange. No, but what she did, she put a tent in the backyard the other day and she put a 10 shut. Shut up. Shut up. I'm trying to promote Valerie.

Speaker 4:          02:17:01       Oh come on please. Do you believe what? I'm going to go extra. I'm no girl. I'm nice enough to put her on your show. Yeah, no girl. And she just has zero respect for men. You know, I came home on Saturday for, you know, with Max and uh, so she had like a barbecue with the spray tanning party, but I wasn't allowed to film a look cause they like got to get addressed and uh, ms panties comes out, you know, just in her panties and I'm like, I can't film this, you know, I can't, you know, I need the footage here. Right. Cause you know, that's like the one thing, I don't know, it's got going on. You know the back, we've got a big ass, this is a guy that on Twitter that says that Kim Kardashians actually got an x ray of her ass to show and prove that it's real. He did that. His name is right. Well you know what? Then she's just eating too much ranch dressing. I'll say it again, Ryan. I mostly, Nah, I'm just know what it does is my wife, how come there's, how's there ever picture with the picture come from? It's on I your wife, you have a fun dumper. Yeah. You see what I mean? And so there's another one.

Speaker 3:          02:18:14       Look at it. Oh my God, Valerie. I thought there was only one. Is there any more full of shit? You told us about it. You knew he was going to search for it. Girls are so God damn predictable. You're seeing my nice body and the photographic form online. I told you it was online and now you're looking at it. That's crazy up there. I don't care. I do the picture for us. You do care. So just say with the fucking Facebook and you wanted beauty is pain. Pain. Hello?

Speaker 4:          02:18:46       Oh, okay. You wanted every once in a PGW about them. Isn't that a code? Shows cost her. Fuck. This shows a total cluster. Fuck you like the olive garden.

Speaker 3:          02:18:59       No girls, no gross. Why no girl dice not allowed too much animosity. Too much history between the jars. Too much crossover where you don't realize it's a podcast. You both talk at the same time. It's too crazy. I'm trying to pull out. He's got to like see how you just overlapping. Oh, you will. You just overlapping. Guess who's fired? Jesus was fired. Now you're fired. That dice man to Saint Charles, Illinois. Andrew dice clay, showtime special, the arcade. A theater on set. You don't steal my employees, man. Saturday, August 25th the arcade, a theater go to oh shows. That's o s h o w s.com all or call the theater at (630) 962-7000 you want to be there. You want to be there for history. He says this is his last special. I say bull shit because it was anything like what I saw in Vegas. People gonna fucking demand you produce more.

Speaker 3:          02:19:56       It's not that I'm that retirement plan on touring a lot. Good. It's weird if that's what I really wanted to listen. That's what I want to say, man. It was a fucking artist in Vegas. I was just going to say it's, I, I, I love that there's guys like you out there. It's, it's so important to me as a, as a person who loves standup comedy and as, even if I never did stand up again in my whole life. I'm a fucking fan of it. I love it and you're going to see a lot. Thank you. It's really fun and don't think, I didn't love that you guys were there. I know when your, when your fellow comics come to see you, you know it's like exciting. So you know that what that show was for you when the guys know that performance was about you and the guy couldn't care less if everybody else left the room.

Speaker 3:          02:20:38       It fires me up creatively when I go see a show. Like the last time I saw show up before yours was Norton's and it just gets me so fired up to them to perform and to right. You know? And I think whether we really, comics really feed off other comics and we get inspired by other comics. So the really be able to sit down and have to watch a real show was really a lot of time, a lot of fun. Man. I just want to say thank you and thanks to Eleanor for interrupting whatever Dyson. Everybody knows we were kidding. Just kidding. Come on, we, everybody knows we were kidding.

Speaker 3:          02:21:10       And Eleanor really is. I mean, I don't know how much better you got, but when I saw you in Irvine, which was more than two years ago, I'm almost, well February, it'll be six years. I was really blown away. I mean, you were really professional already. Yeah, but you know what it was is like you saw so much shit comedy. You saw so many. Yeah. You saw so many old dying road hacks that will do the same act for decade after decade. Do Nixon jokes and shit and you be like, it's 2000 it's 2000 and people were doing jokes about Ford. Nobody knows who Ford is. Mrs. Back when Eleanor was working there and you know you were, it's, it's awesome that you're doing comedy because it was beautiful to watch you and stay there at night. I was like, finally, you know, and nailed it after Andrew's house and all this bullshit.

Speaker 3:          02:21:56       She always wanted to do comedy and she's great at it. You gotta do it yourself every night before she goes on. We, we, we pound each other, you know, and I opened the cart and I never miss a show no matter what's going on. And it's just so great to, to have like the feeling that I know my open is going out and kill in. Right. And it's just somebody that happens to be family to me, you know what I mean? And then of course with Max and now we've got la rocks and my boys had just fucking slamming it. I've been trying to tell all my comedian friends that hate the road. I'm like, you got to go out with other friends. You got to go out with your goal. The only way to do it, you're wasting your time. If you go out and you work with some local headliner who wants to blow you off the stage.

Speaker 3:          02:22:38       Yeah. And they, and they step on your material on purpose. I mean it happens to a lot of my friends, they'll do gigs and the guy will see their act the first night and the second night they bring up the same subjects on purpose. Who tried to kill their best bits? Yeah. Cause they want to have a better set than you. He knows he's from Brooklyn, very spoiled being with Andrew very well. Of course he lets me do my own thing and the crowd. I always tell him I never give up. I never give her time. I just say, when you peek, just get off this. I'm going to say right now you guys both together need a podcast. You know fucking easy. It would be, this is all you need. This is all you need is an iPhone. You on a plane, so listen, listen, you were on a plane, you are in a restaurant.

Speaker 3:          02:23:22       You where you're, you're in your hotel room wherever you are, you having an argument, turn on your iPhone, turning a fucking iPhone and record the argument and they just put dice versus Eleanor and put on iTunes and the, anytime you guys get in an argument, you record dice versus Neller and have it a fucking long running gag. The real arguments, you can't fake your arguments, but then that would be, that would be hilarious. It's going to get yelled at for just talking at the same time, not letting somebody, well Brian Callen, crystally and a will Sasso have this 10 minute podcasts. It's a great idea. It's only 10 minutes. So with you guys, you'd never know what kind of an argument you're into it. It might be a half an hour. It might be the podcast Mike. Oh, but it's fun for, I'm annoyed me more. I'm thinking no dice versus right maximum at the pool or the boss.

Speaker 3:          02:24:15       Yeah, that's right. I'm the bowl. Come. My son knows when to talk and when not to ice versus Eleanor. You just go and go and go and then it's the thread of Deborah.

So thank you all. We appreciate the fuck out of you and we'll see you soon. Bye.
