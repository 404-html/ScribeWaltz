And he goes, ah. He goes in this commercial, he goes and we make it with the exact ingredients that they say in the Bible and Blah, blah blah. Well then if you look up Zeke eel four 12 in the Bible, it says, and you should eat it as barley cakes and bake it using fuel of human waste, human way. So, so in any way, you want to bet [inaudible] for 12

Speaker 2:          00:35          okay, Becky with Dung that cometh out of man in their sight.

Have you ever tried my purple barley cake? You fucking imagine how dumb people are. That really hurts my brain. Do you know what Zeke? Zeke, you'll might've been a tripper cause the Zico was also where the first depictions of Ufos came from. Here, let me pull that up. How do you not read that and just start laughing? You told me to cook shit cakes. The Bible says Cook Shit cakes. That's just one more dumb thing in the Bible. God down. I was so tired of people pretending. That book's awesome. I'm so tired. You stop that shit stupid. Okay, here. Here's a, here's a quote. And I looked and behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud and a fire enfolding itself in brightness was about it and out of the midst thereof as the color of amber out of the midst of the fire. Okay. How's audio file? Hmm?

Speaker 1:          01:53          Somebody putting two points together that don't go together

Speaker 2:          01:57          well, wait a minute, hold on. Listen to this. Also. Out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures and this was their appearance. They had the likeness of a man woe. After in, everyone had four faces in. Every one had four wings and their feet were straight and the sole of their feet was like the soul of a calf's foot and they sparkled like the color of burnished brass. What a trippy book. People like, oh my God, it's so real. I hear God's words when you're saying each things God's speaking to me through your words, please read on. And they had the hands of man under their wings on their four sides and they had, and they four had their faces and their ways. Somebody might have just made all this up and me like an asshole as reading these fake Bible quotes shitting all over the Bible and the aliens.

Speaker 2:          02:48          But guess what? I don't care. I'm not, I'm not reading any further. It's, it seems like if this is, if this really is the gills, it says it is. God dammit. They could saw nuttiness. They walked up with their four faces and they said, why are you guys cooking things in Shit? And the living creatures ran in, returned as the appearance of a flash of lightening. Now as I behold the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures with his four faces. These guys were tripping hard eating shit cake. So yeah, losing their mind. But you are afraid of aliens though, right?
