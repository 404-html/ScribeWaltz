Speaker 2:          00:00:52       we're going to break it down. It's all gonna make sense today. Brian counts here. My brother, my brother, happy to be here and my friends. Thank you to whoever gave me this this weekend at the icehouse. Some dude gave me hunter s Thompson is the rum diary a nice paper back. Just one of the things I got it is shared drugs.

Speaker 4:          00:01:14       Psychedelics, have you done your share yet? No, not yet as mushrooms. I took a four hour shower on mushrooms once. Nice. And then I was hiking in big whiskey mountain on mushrooms with my buddy. We decided to take a back route, which you never do. I was climbing up a landslide. That's smart. And I was like, to my buddy, I go, dude. He goes, what? I go, you got to move with the mountain. You're not moving with the mountain. He's like, okay, he's a real mountain mine. So he's climbing. I go, still not more in the mountain. Okay, I'm gonna stay here and talk to this rock. And I had to have a conversation with the Rock and then as he tells it, we're on top of whisky mountain, which is a very big mountain. Okay. Luckily it was in the summer as well. I was with, I was dating Patrick back in the day and they were waiting downstairs and he turns back around and I'm not wearing any clothes.

Speaker 4:          00:01:56       And I mean, no clue. And I'm, I'm top of a mountain that you, that takes a really long time to climb up and I'm naked. What'd you do with the clothes? Oh, we never found my clothes. No, but I did stop and eat a lot of blueberries and by the time we also took a shit, um, squatting. And then as I was doing that naked, my buddy moved some branches pretending it was a bear jumped up and started to run and uh, that caused a problem. And then I came back down the mountain, all scratched up, no clothes and I can't stop and eat blueberries. My buddy who's got you stop eating blueberries. I had a blue mouth. Uh, Shit. You walked, you walked barefoot. That's right. My phone. I'll cut up. My skills was going to take, I don't know, a day and a, I literally, literally, literally probably four hours or something, like a five hours were up at any point during the war.

Speaker 4:          00:02:47       When I finally got down, I had a blue mouth from eating blueberries and, and I was all cut up and patty was like, what you're doing? I was like, I need to did my ass in the lake. I've shit ass cause I didn't have, I couldn't walk wipe it. So, um, yeah, one another. One of my shit stories. Thank you. So, so she was like, wow, that's attractive. You're a, you're my man. Well I'll take the skinny guy with the Blue Mountain has shit in his assets. It was coming down off mushrooms. So that was my experience with [inaudible]. How much did you take? Did I heat? My buddy gave me just a handful, handful, it goes eat them. I was like, okay, I want to have an experience. You got to get them on an empty stomach. I hadn't eaten. Of course. That's really good. And we're climbing man.

Speaker 4:          00:03:29       And I just started literally just hallucinating. I, you're better off that you didn't eat anything. If you had eaten something, you'd probably throw it really bad. I took a shower one time, I wouldn't get out of the shower. Patty was banging on the door and I was like, I'll be there. I'm trying to figure something out. And then, nope. It's hard to explain. But I believe I kept seeing my profile and the first thing I was like, cause I kept saying, Oh fuck, I wish I was barrel chested. I'm not barrel chest, my grandfather's barrel chested. I know I have a sunken chest. This is horse shit. I was like, that's a terrible profile. So then I resolved, resolved while I was in the shower to just spend the entire summer on a bench press. I was going to hire a coach, just a bench, which that never happened.

Speaker 4:          00:04:09       And then I came out of the shower and then I had this experience of somebody standing like watching me and judging me. And I felt like it was the devil telling me that I was a phony. So I was like, oh, I'm a phony. I'm a skinny phony. Why you think it was the devil? I don't fucking know. I just felt, I saw this just felt like that's what it was like. It was just the truth. And so me and I was so raw. I came out fucking God. Maybe, maybe. Or was it just felt like the devil because he didn't want to, didn't want to admit the truth. Exactly. That's what the badge that is, bro. I can always tell the people, you can just see, it's so interesting to watch how people, like I was thinking about this the other day, how people basically as adults, like I would call it to adulthood and what they call maturity is the slow acceptance of what you will never be.

Speaker 4:          00:04:57       That's kind of what it is. So what happens is you so much things, you see little girls dressed like princesses, right? And and that's their ideal. They grow up with these ideas. We still, we stick these ideals and children. Like you're going to marry a prince and he's going to be pimped prince charming and that shit gets whittled away. You start settling for simulation and simulation. It basically your life becomes, I'll take what I can get until finally you're dating some guy with on his ears and a pot belly. Well at least he pays a fucking bills, which is when I like to get them. By the way, I like to get them when they're just going through a divorce, had their heartbroken to 300 times. They're 40. They work out way too much. That anger and frustration is combined into this fucking creates like a freaky that I can really work with. Hotel 39 year old. Crazy wall.

Speaker 4:          00:05:44       Yes. Yes. Look at my ass like work out all the time. That's fantastic. I like, I'm old, not even old old. That's young for me. So, um, you're coming down the hill, you're totally naked. You're high as a kite on mushrooms. Do whatever. Any point. Realize like you starting to sober up at any point in time. Like what's, what's happening as you're sobering up, what was happening as I was sobering up and because I'm such a freak because I had read a lot about how when you can be on a mountain in the summer, winter storm can brew up, right? They can pick up, you can get caught in hailstorms, freeze to death actually sometimes, you know? And so, uh, I was like, I was like, I got to get the phone and I'd read about k two, and I don't know if he ever read about climbing k two.

Speaker 4:          00:06:31       It's one thing to climb Mount Everest. It's quite another thing that can't climb. K Two I believe there's only one side of k two one can climb. And for a while I believe in, you can check this on fact check one in four people, uh, wouldn't make it. Uh, uh, on k two people died all the time because people would make it. Can you do fact check? Cause I believe that was the case for quite awhile. She's cranky. And so what happened was it was the holy grail of mountains still is cause uh, cause um, what happens is storms whip up really fucking fast. Like really fast and a and you die. Yeah. So, so what happened was I, um, I started thinking of storm might whip up and I suck in the cold. Whoa. What does it say on fact check?

Speaker 2:          00:07:16       Um, it's just talking about there was a, there's been a bunch of disasters.

Speaker 4:          00:07:20       Oh, a lot of people have died on Kaytoo. You don't climb k, two very few people. Client. When you meet a mountain climber and they said, I got to the top of k two that dude is on the all star team. Wow. That's a very rare dude. And you have to go through Pakistan, I think on the Pakistan side. Yeah. No bodies and you, you pass bodies all the time.

Speaker 2:          00:07:40       You know, it's hilarious. The United States just got word from Afghanistan that if we go to war with Pakistan, Afghanistan is on Pax dead side. What a surprise. Out of all the fucking to all the bullshit propaganda, pretending that we're helping those people were all, come on, we're on your side. We're pride. We're extracting minerals, blah, blah, blah. Taking heroin. But we're here for you. We're bribing fucking entire tribes to have loyalty to like Kabul. They're getting information on these guys. You know the number one method for these warlords?

Speaker 4:          00:08:12       No Viagra. Oh, that's right. I read about that. That's right. Hey, I know you, I know you have all these loyalties you want a hard on for a long time.

Speaker 2:          00:08:21       Oh, of course. Yeah. Well these guys, he's warlords. They start hitting 50 and 60 and then you're fucking hurt and goats all day. You're tired, man. You can't take to those 20 wives that you've accumulated. You got cocky when you were young. When you're young, you're young. My blood is hot. You could have 10 fucking wives, but then when you're a 60 year old man, you've got to fuck 10 of these bitches. They started talking shit to him, it's actually four in Islam, you have to treat all of them exactly the same. So if they had four though and one of them was getting all the deck, that's I the other ones, start complaining. It's the craziest thing because I've never met two women. Two women, like four women get along. My friend cat watch. When a girl girls were really good. Here's the good news.

Speaker 2:          00:08:59       I'm marrying you. Bad News. We're all gonna share the same roof. Fucking luck. How are they doing it in the Mormon communities? All these crazy Mormon cults, they don't. It's always been very small subsets, and if you look at who those cult leaders are, they're basically class Jeffrey's tops. Again, closet perverts, sociopath, pedophiles, scumbags. That Guy Warren Jeffs was a pedophile. Totally right. And that it is a sort of part of the kinks, right? They always find out that these guys are marrying, these girls were like 14 and shit. They keep finding that younger, younger, really nice guys. Yeah. It's just weird, man. A weird offshoot. You know that it's just, it's just so strange. It's some people vibrate on a frequency that low their bullshit detectors that week that they get sucked into that kind of a community perspective and context. I mean, when you get somebody who's young and they've never been told anything different, you know, we're just, you look at children with people, you're, you're, you are what you get.

Speaker 2:          00:09:52       What put what's put inside you. You need, you need. That's why I always tell young people fucking read, but read the right things and what you don't know it's going to hurt you. You've got to read. You just gotta you gotta. Did you, have you seen the Zike guys to moving forward? No, I haven't either. I haven't watched the whole thing, but I watched a chunk of it. People just constantly trying to get me to see this thing. It's one of those things where people email me once a day, dude, have you seen Zike guys moving forward? And I'm like, Oh, I saw the first Zeit geist and although I thought it was very moving, I also thought there was like, there's this some stuff on nine 11 that I was like, this is, you're just you, you, you know. There was stuff about the twin towers, like they couldn't have possibly fallen like that.

Speaker 2:          00:10:32       And I'm like, listen man, this is not real science. This is, you don't know what the fuck you're talking about. This is the end to say this to state that for sure that happened I think is crazy. Well, you know, here's the only way to find out, build the same fucking thing. I have another fucking plane fly into it. Let's see if it falls down again. If it does, Ooh, you just fucked up. If you actually want a really good a debunking of that. Um, popular mechanics got together a whole bunch of mechanical engineering science called debunking the nine one one myths and they talk about, for example, how care, um, jet fuel burns at a certain temperature and what, and I believe it's 1600 degrees iron melts at 900 degrees, especially that kind of iron. So it made sense that the iron would start to melt and the building would crumble.

Speaker 2:          00:11:13       But they had a whole bunch of different, they actually took each and it's a really interesting bullying that's annoying when you read the arguments against it because some of the, the information that people pull out is just flat out wrong. Like they're talking about how there's cuts to the beams and you want to say, look folks, they cut the beams when they needed to break everything down because they were clearing out the area. There's a lot of photographs in that man. You, there's no evidence that they cut the beams to bring the fucking building down lanes. A lot of, a lot easier to believe that a group of, of, of young men who are fanatics said, you know what? Let's let's fly planes into a building that seems more than some huge and massive government

Speaker 5:          00:11:54       conspiracy. Think how many people would have to keep their mouth shut again, something like that going not just that, but that, that's the only way of building like that can fall. I really don't think that they have, uh, a lot of data on what the fuck happens. The skyscrapers and they get hit by giant. She didn't say, I didn't know you got your degree in mechanical engineering, my friend. That's exactly, every time I hear somebody, people are full of medical advice as well. I love this. If you read a lot of stuff, for example, what, what people will tell you there was a, there's a good ted lecture by this, a epidemiologist who's a scientist and put actually does science, does the science on, for example, when they said that up glass of red wine a day can help you prevent breast cancer. The problem with that statement that you read in the New York Times and everywhere else is that the actual experiment was they had cancer cells in a petri dish.

Speaker 5:          00:12:41       They dropped red grape extract onto the cancer cells. Those cancer cells died. You'd, that doesn't mean, yeah, you don't is what it is a right, right, right. But you don't, that doesn't mean you infer then that a glass of wine, it's going to kill, you know, it's going to prevent kinds of breast cancer by the way, and cancer itself as an umbrella term for essentially the irregular division of cells, all different kinds of cancer. We don't know why some kick on some happen when you're a child. Others when you're an adult, there are different theories about it. Some are environmental summer genetic. So you know, and by the way, when people say you got to build your immune system, then if you drink this, it'll prevent cancer. In fact, uh, I was reading that some, some cancers don't actually grow as a result of a stronger immune system because they are, they are aligned with your immune system.

Speaker 5:          00:13:37       When your immune system is strong for whatever reason and cell start dividing in a healthy way, the unhealthy cells do as well. So, so, so there are, depending on the cancer, which is why they use chemotherapy of poisons your whole body and that's his off the cancer cells right before it kills off you. That's right. That's right. And you remember some, some cancer intuitive to the holistic approach. There was like super healthy Greens and stuff like that. You want to be healthy. I take all that stuff. I do that. But yeah, I mean we don't forget what western science has given us. Look, up until the 1970s, late seventies, I believe a testicular cancer killed many young men. When you had testicular cancer, you were done. Okay. But because they came up with a chemotherapy that ha that uses, um, yeah, right. That's probably, that's what they used to do.

Speaker 5:          00:14:24       But you, you had things called, but there were, there was, um, um, there's a platinum compound in the chemotherapy. It is, it has made, um, testicular cancer, highly curable. Most, almost always when you get to stick a look, cancer young men live now budget they take, they take chemo, they're sick for a little bit and then it just goes away and it's curative. So you know, you gotta be careful, you're right with people, have a lot of information and if you actually start scratching the surface and asking them questions, it's like, dude, you don't, where are you getting your information? Do you know the genealogy of your idea? Did you study?

Speaker 2:          00:14:57       Do you, do you know what? Too many people are just too quick to just grab a hold of a yes or a no or this side or that side. And you've got to look at the whole thing. You know the, the only thing that puzzles me about September 11th is that the sat that uh, tower seven building, and there's a lot of debate on that. That's the one that the architects and engineers from nine 11 truth have a problem with. They don't know why that building collapse like that and it looks like a controlled demolition. That's really interesting. I've seen a bunch of them. It's, it's very interesting because I'd never seen a building fall into its base like that. Like give out in uniform and come down a straight line. But it doesn't mean that it can't happen. Right. It's gotta be real careful about that.

Speaker 2:          00:15:32       Yeah, it looks like a controlled demolition and you know, you've hear that this Larry Silverstein guy had all this money invested in it and when the, you know, if the buildings went down, he made billions of dollars and you hear all this craziness online. But the, the real reality is, again, we don't know how a building like that performs until something like that happens. You got to light it on fire. You got to make big holes in it. Yeah. And the other thing is nobody ever realizes that these are people, right? So if you look at, like if you, if you read like Bob Woodward's though,

Speaker 5:          00:16:01       are you looking at how like governments, the CIA, this defense intelligence and the national security agency, the White House, if you, if there's a crisis, it's really interesting to see and if you look at these memoirs now that are coming up about, about the Bush era, it's really interesting to see how they do arrive at, at, at conclusions and decisions to take action. It's fucking heated in those rooms. And like human beings, everybody's got a different point of view. Everybody has their own group of people they control and, and it comes down ultimately to date. Everybody presents their case to the present, biting their lip, having testy arguments, not talking to each other, threatening to resign like Condoleezza Rice did with, with the Donald Rumsfeld cause she just didn't get along with him. She thought he was condescending, et cetera. And the president and finally has to be like, guys, guys, can you, hey, let's not stop fighting. Stop it. I'm the one who makes the decision, ultimately present your idea to me.

Speaker 2:          00:16:54       Way Scarier is the idea that we actually let a guy like Bush really be president to me is way scarier than the idea that there's some massive conspiracy amongst globalist to control all the resources. But my fact that a guy really could be president and they really don't have it locked down. Totally. It's true. Like I know it's not pushing to have a lot of wisdom. He didn't have to, he was there. He's a puppet. They obviously had Dick Cheney and Dick Cheney was a guy who was the fucking CEO of Halliburton, uh, a company that made untold billions of dollars reconstruct and countries after we blow them the fuck up. It's not a coincidence at this guy would be really fascinated with going to war. I mean, he owed own stock. The president, President Bush was a fucking character on a sitcom for us. Listen, calm guy that spoke for us, Condoleezza Rice had a huge

Speaker 5:          00:17:43       falling out with Dick Cheney and a huge, huge arguments about the fact that the guy believed in a extraordinary, I think it's called extraordinary rendition, where we would kidnap people, kidnap people, and take them to undisclosed locations, usually a country they didn't object to torture and a and put them in these detention cells, the CIA prisons. And she was like, you can't just disappear people you can't do that. Can't you can't take somebody off the streets of Italy and bring them to the Turkey.

Speaker 2:          00:18:12       There's certain people that have an unquestionable character to certain people. You hear him talk and you say, that's a man of character. That's amount of intelligence. That's amount of experience. Yeah. Colin Powell is one of those people. I hear that guy talk and I go, that guy's legit. That's the real also against the Iraq war. Yes he was. And he was like, oh, did anytime in uniform. Yes. And he was also, you know, disenchanted with the entire administration and it didn't really work out for him. And you know, everybody was real excited when he joined the Bush administration. But you know, there's a guide that really is a real American hero. He's the, these, the real fucking deal. And he's with all these jackasses and war criminals and fucking thieves and he has to sit there and watch them pillage, just pillage the world. Those motherfuckers well till too seriously. But I think that it's worth being serious about that. You know, it is, but it isn't because it's not helping anything. No, but, but no, like I have a joke about occupy Wall Street and I totally support the movement, but the joke is that those hippies are just going to start living there. Now what's going to happen is you're going to go there, everyone's just going to be shitting all over the street and you just have to just drive through that all the way to work. Hey Man,

Speaker 5:          00:19:22       will you doing is wrong man. Well, nothing ever changes ever. And that's the thing I was talking to Neil and Neil Brennan was telling kind of like, give me a hard time for not, not. Um, I disagree with them. On a lot of things. But um, he was, he, but I respect meal because he works very hard at earning and opinion developing an opinion. We are, we're on a bit, I think we're on different sides of the equation but, but Neil, Neil, Neil was saying you should be down there protesting. And my problem with the protest movement, the occupy Wall Street movement is that I don't, I don't know that that's the only group to play there. There are a lot of groups to plan the government, Wall Street, irregular consumers that were buying houses and knowing they couldn't afford them. Nobody ever talks about that.

Speaker 5:          00:20:03       And, and, and so there and so when you occupy Wall Street, what you're really talking about Wall Street of course, just a euphemism or just a kind of a name for I very amorphous group of people. Because what you're talking about when you talk about Wall Street is the investment community. That's what you're talking about now. Do you want to protest the investment community? If so, let me ask some questions. What aspect of the investment community, cause I would remind everybody they pay a lot in taxes. They also produce a lot of wealth. You wouldn't have startup companies without venture capital for example. You want to start taxing, uh, uh, you know, um, the capital gains tax, see what happens to your venture catalyst. He's, we'll see what happens to capital that is invested in businesses. So I don't know the answers. These are complicated issues.

Speaker 5:          00:20:45       And you start following that thread and start saying, well, let's occupy Wall Street. Okay, okay. There are some unscrupulous assholes and Wall Street. There's no doubt. There's no doubt. But, but what are we going to do about it? I would, I believe personally that you had an incentive structure in place and incentive structure and a system with holes in it where smart people got together and said, hey, you know what? I got to tell you this. There are some very big legal loopholes here and we can make a lot of money. You know, why? Because three other houses down the way or making a shitload of money. So what are we doing guys? Cause we're not gonna be able to compete. Here's another thing, we may be out of a fucking job if we don't do this. So there were, so when you're in that and you start to realize it, it's really an interesting development where you go, Gee, what would I, what would I do in that situation as well?

Speaker 5:          00:21:34       It was so, it was so fucking murky and it seems to me what you want to fix is the incentive structure. Do you want to fix, you want to go back to two nuts and bolts, nuts and bolts. What are you producing? What is the bottom line? How do you produce wealth? What does produce wealth in the past? And, and um, she may have been making money off just making money and moving money around, passing risk along. Remember, remember even much bigger than the actual size of the actual economy as he, there's a bus of the derivatives, right? Yes. And, and, and there's a very good book that I'm about to read. And I had two very big bankers who are in this, who were in this and had lived through it and saw every bit, every detail. And they said, the book to read is the big short by Michael Lewis.

Speaker 5:          00:22:16       He wrote Liar's poker. It's would like to read this book called the big short, really for anybody. It'll explain the genesis and, and this guy is, and is not, it doesn't have a grind to acts here. He's, uh, he's, he is a journalist who is a outstanding FirstClass writer. I read liar's poker. He's a great writer. I believe it's Michael Lewis is his name. I might be wrong with the first name, but the point is that he wrote the big short, and that is renowned, that is, that is widely respected as the book and sort of the Bible on how the shit happened and what happened. And essentially who's to blame. But you start going into that blame game. It's really interesting. It's really fucking interesting because there are a lot of people and they're not just republicans and not just libertarians. A lot of people can make a very strong case for things like the equal lending, housing lending act, that the kinds of laws that came out of government, because it was very popular in the Republican and democratic side to say, Hey, I'm going to pass legislation that makes it easy for everyone.

Speaker 5:          00:23:13       Own a house. That's the American way. That's the American dream. Uh, they did a study that they that listen to this really interesting. The first, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston did a study. They found that even if you're qualified for a loan, if you're a minority, if you're black or Latino, and even if you're just as qualified as a white person, you're four times as likely to be turned down, turned down for that loan. Okay? So if you're black or you're Latino, back in, I think this was in 1996 or whatever, I don't remember the date. If you're black and Latino, you have the

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       same credit as a white person. You're still four times as likely to be turned down for a loan. Countrywide mortgage is all in the family. Maybe you need it and then everybody could, but countrywide Morgan said, fuck this. Let's open a bunch of small offices with minority people working in there. Let's start giving loans to these people if they had the same credit rating, let's do that. It's really interesting when you start really listening to the shit and you're like, wow, man, this is, this got this got fucking crazy on top of the fact that Europe, the rich countries, we're buying our, our mortgage back securities, they were buying the housing debt and so we could pass it on. It's just so weird that people thought that it was normal that you would buy a house and then it would be worth twice as much in two years.

Speaker 2:          00:24:27       That's what happened. Like what happened to my house, dude, I, everybody was telling me this dude, I bought it for 500 I sold it for a mill and I'm like, what? Yeah, you, you, you just made a half a million dollars just like that. How the fuck did you do that? How's that happen? How's that real? My father, who was a banker, said, my father looked at me and he goes, uh, not going to last because I was to kind of buy it. I was going to buy a piece of property getting a real estate. He goes, you know anything about real estate? And I go, no. He goes, you're not how to make people laugh, right? I go, yeah. He goes, stick to making people laugh because you're going in real estate, you will lose all your money, all this route and well, not only that, right, don't be cocky and think you can jump into a game like that and not give it 100% of your attention.

Speaker 2:          00:25:00       Like people saying they're going to moonlight in MMA. I'm going to have a couple of fights on the side. Good luck with the rest of your life. Thinking out of that shitty brain of yours, cause someone's going wrap a fucking Shin around your skull and you're not gonna remember things too good after that. And then the hardest, I'm sorry, but that is the hardest way to earn a living. So I walked up there, I watch these guys fight and you know, and I was watching, I was watching baseball the other day. I'm watching the world series and you know, baseball, they're athletes, they can hit a ball. You know, you've got to swing the bat perfectly. You've got to throw, you've got to feel the ball and it's, you know, there's a lot of skill involved in baseball but, but when it comes to fighting and you're out there with gloves that are just tiny and you and somebody else is trying to knock your fucking head off and you have to know how to kick punch and Russell so much more difficult, so much more as on lawn, physically, your, your physical health, your playing a game, how much your courage or your mind, you gotta stay loose but aggressive and you're going to be exposed in front of all these people.

Speaker 2:          00:25:53       You're gonna people are gonna see you break, what would you not, you probably are not allowed to even say this cause you, you call the fights. But if, if you had to put, I don't know if it's a fair question, I was you about the stone and Anderson Silva fight or are they gonna fight first of all, do we know? Who knows? I don't know. I'm a, Dana likes the fight. It's a promotable fight for sure. It's a very exciting fight. Anderson kind of hesitant to fight him. I don't believe so. I believe his manager has said some things, but you know, a lot of that is just a, it's a, it's a game. You know, you got to realize that promotion, uh, you know, managing fighters and stuff, there's a lot of publicity involved and there's a lot of, just keeping it in the press is a good thing. Saying the child doesn't deserve it as a good thing. Building up any sort of animosity is a good thing. And then sales people. So yes, she does deserve it. Anderson's where he's going to kick his ass. Then you got, you got a thread going, man. So you can't, he can't be a rube. You've got to look at these things and go listen

Speaker 6:          00:26:44       and sores is a smart dude. And Anderson Silva is a goddamn genius and chill son and is the greatest marketing mind that combat sports has ever known by a long shot. No one's funny than him. No one wanted me to hear that in him. He's a beast. I watched him and I get depressed it, I'm not helping what he said to Brian Stann. He said, he is an American hero and he's going to get a good old fashioned red, white and blue ass kicking. It was so great. I saw, I'm talking about the nuclear brothers. He's on another level. It's talking about the Nogueira brothers. It's like they thought that's possible that they thought it was a rocky [inaudible] interview with a man. He's, he's saying give them a carrot. I brought it up to him. He goes, that happened. He goes, one of them pull this belt off like he's going to take it home.

Speaker 6:          00:27:23       Come on little fella and you know I'm white dude. On top of that. Then motherfucker could fight his ass off. If he was just a shit talker, I would still love him, so I'd be lost. Everything like Sean McCorkle has lost a couple of times in the UFC and you know, or at least once in the o Sing Sha. Sorry Sean for I said one, but he's a great shit talker. He's a hilarious shit talker. I'm like, I like to see the guy back just to hear him talk some more shit. You know, Shell's son and talk shit. Anybody funnier than I am and I'm a comedian. I'm like, Hey, this guy's got, he's figured out how to finish guys instead of just staying on top of guys and punched him in the face. You know, you can win a fight like that, but you know what else you can do.

Speaker 6:          00:28:00       You can lose a fight like that cause the guy survives and catches you in a submission when you're on top of a guy. If you're a wrestler, the kind of caliber of [inaudible] and you're not going to get up, man. The only way you're going to get up as he's going to make it subtle mistake it probably late in the fight. You know, maybe he's trying to finish you off and he gets cocky and you, you get an under hook and you get back up to your feet. But for the most part a guy that can keep you down and if he's got good submissions, fuck, why would he have good submissions? What? Look at the elite level grappling he has. All you have to do is just teach them a few different positions and he'll be elite in those positions as well. And his triangle that he hit Brian Stann with was a crusher dude because Brian Stan was defending the right way.

Speaker 6:          00:28:38       The way to defend is called like answering the phone, you put your hand over your ear and it relieves some of the pressure. But chill, squeeze is so fucking tight that it didn't matter. He did everything perfect. He's he just positional a will, Willa strong gorilla, strong end, mentally tough as fuck. He's tough as fuck and has crack in the past and it's tougher because of it. How about that has quit in the past, had, has done things in the past that he's not happy with and those things motivate him in a fight and much like George Saint Pierre, I think losing and cracking under pressure makes them more dangerous. I really do. When a guy's been humiliated a couple of times and then he comes back and is a fucking Badass. There's a different level of intensity that those guys have. A guy's been humiliated like a George Saint Pierre. There's a, there's an intensity that he brings to the table where this is not going to fucking happen again. That's also on the menu on the menu is I'm going to kick your ass. I'm on. On the menu is I'm going to force you to fight my, my fight, but also on the [inaudible] menu is that Matt Serra fight is not going to fucking happen again.

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       Salesman caught by Anderson and a triangle. Paula filio caught him in an arm bar, but he's a, he's a better fighter than back then. I don't know what's going on. I don't know if its consistency, intensity. I know a lot of his strength resides in his hair and they think sand delicious here dude, he's a, he's a fucking most marketable guy ever. He's a man. He's just, he should have his own right where you can talk radio show when you're a man and you're watching the guy, you're like, Aye. He's definitely the silver back and I'm a backbone. I'll throw fruit from the tree and he's entertaining as hell. Man, he said was saying, Larry, this is great. I'm a big fan of that guy so that's going to be a big fight. The rematch, those, but Anderson right now is recovering from a shoulder injury and that's tricky man.

Speaker 2:          00:30:22       I mean they can take a long time. I came to the last it depending on the severity of Anderson's injury. Cain Velasquez has been out for a long time. I mean he had to get surgery and that's a good solid nine months. It's a very complicated joint. The shoulder. I mean, look at all the different moves that the shoulder can do and think about how loose the tissue has to be inside of there. And if something goes wrong, if there's tears and soft tissue damage or worse ligament rips and things that need, and you got to go back in there and stitch everything up and put it together and you know, possibly even, you know. Yeah. And possibly even have more than one surgery. Yeah. I mean there's, there's people that have shoulder injuries and it's nine, 10 months. Wow. Yeah, it's a long time. So Kane still hasn't come back yet.

Speaker 2:          00:31:03       So he's his junior dos Santos fight is his first fight back on Fox because he's been out for Jesus. It's been to, it's got to be like a year. He beat Brock Lesner over a year ago, I believe. I'm not, I'm not exactly sure when the, uh, the fight took place. He, and my opinion is just, he's the perfect size heavyweight where he's not a giant guy, so he doesn't require all this amazing oxygen, but he's still small. So can move is always that debate about what, what's the perfect size? Because when you got, when you're to 60 you don't have the kind of explosive speed with your punches. He usually got a lot of weight in those arms to when you fill up with blood man, you lose the snap into the punches. He's got great, snapped his punches because he's not muscle balance. Right? He's got a real athlete's body.

Speaker 2:          00:31:50       I mean his, his body is exactly built that way because of years of combat sports. So it's built the exact way it needs to be to perform at the level that he wants to pour it. And with him, the big thing with that guy, his volume, he has the most ridiculous pace of any heavyweight and they never seen a guy with cardio. His ability. Yeah, his cardios was insane. It doesn't make any sense. He's 240 pounds and Africa gives out works Lightweights at the gym at Aka Aka American Kickboxing Academy in San Jose. One of the best gyms in the country, filled with killers, you know, filled with John Fitch and Josh Koscheck and Mike Switch. And all these fucking animals up there and this guy is outlasting them in in conditioning drills. That's unheard of. You're talking about like a Josh Thompson like well those kinds, that's like an elite, elite MMA athlete. You know, like as good a shape as you can get an as

Speaker 6:          00:32:40       athletic as you can get in and to have this fucking freak heavyweight beating them in, in, in exercise drills. It's really kind of crazy. Or at least getting close to them. Heavyweights are traditionally way easier to tire out and he just puts a pace on these guys so you could see them and just can't believe it's real. They can't believe it's real. Like a perfect example. The Brock Lesnar fight was a good example. That was a good example, but there's been a couple of other fights in earlier in his career where you just see him hit guys with this pace. I'm a big Ben Rothwell. That's a perfect fight. He hit Ben Rothwell with this pace that was just ridiculous. It was just ferocious. Everything he did was perfect. Every takedown was perfect. Every side positioning was perfect. Every Hammerfest was perfect because he wasn't touch was perfect. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:33:24       It just keeps going six feet, six foot one and Sammy, something like that. It's not a giant guy. Like I said, he's only two 40. Unbelievable. He's not a, he's not a, might be a little, it might be six foot one at the most. I should, I should actually look that up. You can say, uh, he's Mexican, you know his brown pride tattooed on his chest. Somebody. That's how you know he's a bad motherfucker. I write ca and you in a yacht, you know Google and it says Cain Velasquez. That's how you know you're a bad mother fucker. Okay. Not even Canada or California are castration or castration or cat cats

Speaker 4:          00:33:57       or cats. That's what would come up. Mine says catch. I mean you guys, I should just say it now. I'm a cat free. Six foot one six foot one two 44 perfect. Size heavyweight. Not, not too big. Not too small. And if a guy like Brock Lesnar can't out muscle you, I'm so depressed. I'm five 11 one 70 but you always say this but you never do anything about it. I lift weights, dude. Do you do heavyweights? Like did you, do you read Tim Ferriss's book? Did you see all this to shut the shit that he had about gaining weight? Yeah, but I really want to get bigger. You wouldn't be as funny. I know that's a problem. I don't want to spend that much time trying to like work on my body. It's too embarrassing. You would be just as funny. That's ridiculous. But I don't, I don't want to spend somehow, I don't want to spend a lot of time, a lot of time trying to get big and just swamp 10 pounds more muscular, tired, quick, just embarrassing that I don't get tired quick.

Speaker 4:          00:34:46       The real problem with the big muscles is that you have to feed those bitches. You don't realize what a big difference it makes. That's why like, you know, you look at the real elite UFC athletes like Bj Penn and Nick Diaz, they don't look like a darkness. I was talking to him at that premiere of warrior. I was looking at Bj Penn, I was like, well, you're about as threatening and a buttoned down shirt as the ups guy. You got those ears closed up. I know what that means, but I'm looking at him and go on, I'm sorry I'm taller than you. And frankly my shoulders are broader. I, that's all I was thinking the whole time you're sizing them up. People must do that to Bj on a daily basis. Nobody dummies. He wants to have to talk to. I just keep looking at him like, I mean how were you one of the baddest man on the planet yet? He is, oh, he's an animal and then I met Alistair Overeem who was white. The opposite elsewhere. Overeem is like someone

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       gave someone a super person pill. I was going to say, if you were a character in a comic book and you know you found a pill was an doctor, laboratories are spinning nail impersonator. That's what he, yeah. Okay. Adam Corolla would say about women who are really hot, female, female impersonators. He's a male male. I was like looking at his back, I was grabbing his arm. I was basically doing everything but making out with a guy. I was like, ah, here's the thing about Alastar know when since he's been that big, no one's had to push him in an MMA fight. You know his, his fights that he's had while he's been that big or really kickboxing, he's done very well. But I think there's something to that size in kickbox and that's particularly intimidating with the skill of an ouster over him. He's very good at covering up.

Speaker 2:          00:36:25       He has so much muscle and I think that muscles also sorta like a padding. It's like armor. My friend Walter say that when we were doing taekwondo, he would say that muscles don't help you learn that teach out of fight. But where they do do no doubt about it is offered protection. He goes, they protect you against injuries and he goes in, it's padding and you've got to think of your, if your body body's heavily muscled, it's patty. There's a certain point in time where it's a point of diminishing returns. But the question remains as to whether Allister's hit that point of diminishing returns because he's so big and in kickboxing, he's a fucking beast and he was a bad motherfucker when he fought Alster or when he fought on Brett Rogers. But truth be told, Brett Rogers is not at his level. He's not nearly technical enough, standing up to stand with Allister and you're not going to, he's not world class wrestler, so he's not going to take them on the ground.

Speaker 2:          00:37:08       He's basically a brawler who was in there with one of the best precision strikers in the world. So that wasn't exhausting. Allister, Allister Allister's that wrestling is not that good, but he's got real good Jujitsu. Wrestling is not good. He's not, he doesn't have the best takedown defense, but it's good, you know. But the bottom line, it says he's got a nasty guillotine choke. He choked out. Vito Belfort with it. If he tore tapped, yeah, it caught [inaudible]. I mean that's how good. He's a lot taller though. Yeah. Well back then he wasn't back then. They were both fighting around the same way. Interesting. Yeah, he might have a eat some good foods and you know, got a lot of weight put on his body and my friend people put 35 40 pounds. Well he does work hard man. His workouts are unbelievable. There's, there's videos of him online, crazy dead lifts and all this strength and shit.

Speaker 2:          00:37:52       But they're the true test of that. Whether or not you could perform with all that muscle on really is when you get stuck under the bottom of a guy like Brock Lesnar. That's the true test. You know, because that big mother fucker will take you down and he'll be on top of you and you might be, fuck son. I think Bronx biggest challenge is knowing how to a box with a guy like Cain Valasquez cause that takes forever to learn. Well because king can wrestle. See Cain is a nightmare because cane can wrestle. He started as an excellent wrestler. So his technique is a wrestler too. He's very technical. Like even though he's like, he does like a lot of shit. Like he chains take downs, does it in a way that very few heavyweights do. It's like the way he moves. He's like the way a lighter weight guy would wrestle and so brings this really technical wrestling to it too.

Speaker 2:          00:38:37       So when Brock starts heaving and hoeing just a little, Kane's got under hook, she's back up to his feet and boom and cans all of a sudden kickbox with them, lighten them up. His, his, you know, he's got the worst case scenario for a guy like Brock. He's got nasty standup, knocked out Nogueira ridiculous flurry the way that no one's able to do. You know, he's good man. His standup as good and he can take a shot. He took two solid punches from Czech Congo that dropped him. Same kind of punches that knocked Pat Barry unconscious and he took it right on. The Chet dropped and then he completes a takedown. That's what's so sick and amazing about it. Cut like Frankie Edgar for example, who is me right now, the most impressive human being. The fact that that guy can take shots to the face. There's a correlation between both of them.

Speaker 2:          00:39:21       Neither one cut. Wait. I was going to say I was gonna. I was gonna ask you about that because when it seems to me, if a fight's going to go three rounds, it's one thing to cut weight. When the fight's going to go five rounds, cutting weight is, is going to be a liability. You know, usually if the guy, the other guy has not cut weight, your, your muscles and all those cells are hydrated and you're not gonna, you're not gonna get as tired. So it's an interesting kind of, well, you know, strategy, they re uh, they rehydrate with Ivs and it helps, it's definitely better than the way they used to do it guys. The way they used to do it, you started eating slowly and then they would start slowly sipping water. Yeah, I know. Try to get up in the middle of the night and drink water and they would drink water and pedialyte.

Speaker 2:          00:39:57       But now, now that the smart way to do it is with an ivy, but there's been some studies apparently that were done on soldiers. Um, and I need to get ahold of this. My friend Dustin told me about it and they were talking about how long it takes to rehydrate your cerebral spinal fluid and all that stuff. And that is where it's scary because that shit takes weeks when you get hit and you're dehydrated. Very bad for your brain, very bad for your man. You cannot take a shot nearly as well. [inaudible] you're more likely to die. What is gray Maynard? Uh, walk around. That to me tells me he's a big guy. Like one 90 or something. I don't, well I think he can probably get up to one 90 of his eating whenever the fuck he wants and power lifting and shit. But he's most certainly too big for one 55 I think.

Speaker 2:          00:40:35       I mean, look, he's a beast, man. Don't get me wrong. If he catches you with, with a big shot, he'll put you away. But I think he's so thick that, you know, for him it might be better if you're like lifted last and just got just a little bit more cardio into a system. And I know he's got good cardio, don't, don't get me wrong, but he doesn't have the same cardio that a guy like Edgar does. And I think one of the reasons for it is a guy like Edgar has less body mass period. He has less, less, much small oxygen that has to push through the muscles. And I think again, there's a point of diminishing returns. Edgar is obviously not as strong as as gray. Maynard gray Maynard is way stronger than him. The way scarier a punch or two, he can hurt you with like one of those early punches that he hit and it with. Holy Shit Dude, his upper cut is nasty to Greg can punch, but I think that's a mechanical thing, man. I think he would be able to punch like a motherfucker no matter what. I think he's just become a much better boxer over the course of the time we've seen him in the UFC. I don't think him a

Speaker 4:          00:41:33       little bit of mass would would hurt that. I really don't. I think he would. He would be, you know, I think he would benefit from just having a little less mass on his body. But this is just me talking shit. If he knocked out Frankie Edgar in the first round, I'd be saying, oh, he improved and he came back and he's, he's, you know, he's the best of the, the division now. And think about the thing about you UFC now as these guys become better punchers those little gloves becomes such a liability for any kind of error. You make any fucking mistake. And you go out, look at Eve Edwards, he was a great fighter. He was fighting really well. But one shot to the jaw with those, you're done the way eves went down. Like a guy who has been knocked out before though there's an, I'm not saying that it wouldn't have happened a long time.

Speaker 4:          00:42:18       Yeah. I'm not saying that it wouldn't have happened anyway because it was an excellent shot. You know, it could have put them out anyway. But man, it was disturbing how we went out because I really like Eve Edwards. He's a smart dude and he's a cool guy. And he said very skilled guy too. And you know, it's been around for a long time. You know it, you spin around. I watched him fight in the hook and shoot days back when he fought Aaron Riley and we were in, we were in Pittsburgh together and we were doing warrior and he was a, he was, it wasn't me and Nate Marquardt when we were in my apartment and he was there, we were all a little drunk. And I start yapping off and I, and I'm like, and I'm like, you know, and I'm like, well I don't know why you guys don't just fucking go for a double.

Speaker 4:          00:42:55       I tag them that I'm just saying stupid shit that he was trying to get his goat. I'm like, cause I know you're a boxer. I know. But then I was talking to us, so my, you want no part of my feet and my friend, I'm doing all this shit. He's like, he's trying to say, he's like really? And they, all of a sudden he grabs me and now he's practicing moves on me as I'm trying to fucking stay alive and on, on the rug as he's letting me choke them out. He's like, choke me and God, I'm not gonna fucking choke you gods. And he goes, could try, just try, come on try. Next thing I know, I'm like, I'm getting like twist it around. It's so fun in a role with guys like that. Just what they can do to you. It's just fucking ridiculous.

Speaker 4:          00:43:27       So you just started training again though. How long? How many times? Just once. Just once. How many years off to Jeff years? We had a weird situation. How does Brian scared the shit out of me when, when he told me this, this whole story is, it's very disturbing. Um, you had a real, real medical problem. You, I had, I had a concussion and um, I, my hands for like three months felt like I was holding a hot snowball and it would come back all the time. And I found out that, that, that is one of the case. That's one of the effects of a severe concussion because I had a 40 minute fight with this guy named Pasqual, this French guy, and boom, boom. And Sini was watching and I, and I, it was at street sports and I didn't want to lose, I was like, I'm not tapping in front of boom, boom, but how'd you get a concussion?

Speaker 4:          00:44:13       I think I didn't even, you know, when you're wrestling that hard, you don't even realize you get, you know, you hit your head on the mat, you've fallen, you're doing all kinds of crazy going crazy. I just hit my head on the mountain a drilled recently. I was like, whoa. That was a hard one. Yeah. Head head injuries are no joke. But you know, I just, uh, uh, and I'm back though. I miss it. So when you, uh, you didn't know what the injury was, you couldn't pinpoint that with brain tumor man? Nobody. I know, but I mean, when, what had happened when we were rolling, there's not one moment that I don't remember any of it. And I've been so, you don't even know. I've been knocked out. I've been kicked in the head up and punt I know wouldn't be being knocked out as you know.

Speaker 4:          00:44:48       I know, but um, for this it was just, I got, I, I guess, I think what happened was at one point I, I went, I think I was standing and I came back and hit my head on the mat and we just kept, you know, who knows, who knows. You don't think about what you're fighting. Are we doing this? Why are we as a grown man while you're having this? Because I still haven't let go of the fact that I'm a pool is a lack of some mole man. Bill. Like I want to be, I want to, I wish I had some small, that's all I want. Just a little, give me a little fucking Simone. I just want the hair and the dark skin. No hair on my skin. Good. Look, I can wear turquoise and be a bad ass. Yeah. I can't wear jewelry.

Speaker 4:          00:45:30       I looked like a fucking, I look like a something that I tell in who wears turquoise or jade. Johnny Depp, he gets away with all that shit were awesome. This something about when guys were like large silver bracelets with big jade ovals inside of them. You're like, okay dude, what do you do? You believe in channeling? Oh, is what I ask them like right away, what's going on with you man? He's spent some time with Sedona. Exactly. Do you know any healers? Exactly why? My ex wife's a healer. I was in, I went here, I went to John Varvatos, you know that, that we're where it costs $1 million for a pair of shoes. What does that, it's a really cool clothing company that actually loved their clothes, actually look good in their clothes. You know, it makes them for guys who were built exactly like me, but it's like really nice cashmere sweater, shit you wear all the time.

Speaker 4:          00:46:10       That, that it's like, because guys have two criteria when they dress right. They don't want to look like a pussy and they want to be comfortable. That's it. That's it for me. I don't, I'm not dressing, I'm not wearing, you know, but, um, so I get in there and that dude, that dude, this guy is like just very phase, just like, hi, how are you? I'm like, good. He's like, um, well let's start. I go, I'm doing a one hour special for showtime and I'm bullshitting. I'm like, you know, I am by the way, but I go, I'm doing a special, and I go, um, and I want to, I need somebody, I need to wear something on stage. I don't know what I'm gonna wear. We have some great stuff and he brings me over at, and before I know it, I'm wearing like, I got a vest on, I gotta, I got a fucking awesome fedora.

Speaker 4:          00:46:47       I got this, he puts this, this unbelievable, this like chain around my, I look, I looked in the mirror and I was like, I'm sorry, but right now not to be a dick. I'm the coolest looking motherfucker on the planet. This is, this is, I look them up. I was so impressed with how good I look. And I went, I've never worn jewelry. And he goes, oh, I mean if you don't wear jewelry then all you're wearing his cloth. That's our rule here. I'm like, well you have to wear jewelry. Well it just looks, I was surprised but then right. But then I looked at him in the mirror and I was looking at myself when I went like this and I said right in front of my goal. Then again, I do punch people for looking like, you know, you see guys who are like, they walk in like, you know intelligentsia coffee where they charge you $6 for a cup of coffee and their hair's just must, just the right way.

Speaker 4:          00:47:32       They got a bracelet on this. Awesome. Don't hate the player Bro. I hate the game cause that shit works. It does. We pull up in a late model Maserati, you know you have a fine [inaudible] that shit. Reading, reading, perhaps the Wall Street Journal. I want to keep up on. The market's going to get my coffee. Why me? Yeah, very successful financially when a man typically not so much since the family died in the fire, I just can't find the right one. If family died in the fire, you don't introduce any tragedy until at least the first couple of two or three dates. Got a biggest problem when I'm not running, not running orphanages. I guess my biggest problem is what? The sweat to spend all my money on. You got to come off like a hippie pussy. They don't, you don't want that. Don't talk to the orphanage.

Speaker 4:          00:48:11       She can. She can find that out. You're making grand plans. You can't keep banging her for long. You're at a one night pled. If you want to keep a girl in the game, you can't just make up orphanages. I do. I like, I like the Oscars like the Wall Street Journal. That's good. Yeah. You've got to pretend like you're a serious person. I'm a man. She's lost. She's got a pair on fucking rent, man. It's hard. It's hard out there. You know she's not in, she doesn't feel like a woman, but yet she is who she is to just, I just manage my investments. I wear one of those book bags that you could keep your dog in the back. Have you seen those things with the little book bags? They met carrier dogs, animals in the back. Wouldn't you want it in the front? So you dog nose bleed.

Speaker 4:          00:48:51       A little dogs are great chick magnets, puppies. But what's crazy about these book bags, it's like if you look at the reviews like on Amazon or whatever, there's so many psychos that are like, I could fit all three cats. I love going to target with my cats and my cat. The reviews are hilarious. Checking it on our podcast where somebody was talking about walking their cat on a leash. Who was the, maybe there's a guy that walks his cat on a leash by my house. Someone, God, I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry. Someone on, I believe, I thought it was on our podcast was talking about walking in cat and all that. I might've said they had a history teacher in college who uh, who told me that his buddies dog, his buddies lab had like a litter of puppies. Like get the fuck can we do with these puppies.

Speaker 4:          00:49:31       There's like eight weeks they're weaned and stuffs like nobody wanted puppies. He's like, fuck, and they're like board and go on to the beach. And I was like, I got to the, so let me just feed the dogs. And his buddy goes, hold on, I've got an idea. It's like, what do you mean? He goes, let's paint the puppies to the peach and the guys like, what do you mean being the fucking pub is? He goes, don't worry about it. Next thing you know, they got a box of puppies and they have a sign that says rent a puppy and they're renting puppies. You can go take, just take the puppy for an hour, leave a credit card, play with the puppy. Of course everybody wanted to fucking puppet. They're like, how much do I have the book? But my buddies, my history professor was like the girls, the girls that ended up that everybody ended up hooking up with were just unbelievable. You just surrounded by girls, bring a bunch of puppies to a fuck to the fucking beach. Forget your gym. You're working out for three months trying to get your chest. All right, bullshit. You don't have to work out. Just show up with a bunch of puppies. Girls will flock to you. There you go, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you. Rent a puppy. Brian Collins, a genius when it comes to picking up chicks, you don't really want to up in the first place.

Speaker 6:          00:50:29       That's the problem. Everybody is so starving to get laid. Men are so starving. The reason why there's so many bitches pussies in the men department and this world today is because of the commodity of pussy is so goddamn powerful and it's totally the, the percentage of the market devoted to pussy is like, it's shit. It's got to be like 40 or 50% of the market is based on pussy acquiring it. Right? And pressing it

Speaker 4:          00:50:54       the, when I, when I think of the conversations I've had, the sincere conversations I've had with girls just to get laid where my brow is not. And I'm like, really? That's amazing. Say more stuff that we do when, so tell me about this dream you had again.

Speaker 6:          00:51:07       Ooh, wow. And women to get angry at us for this insincerity. But this is what you have to understand. Okay, we're junkies and you're the dealer. It's really that simple. The Universe is set up fucked up because we have the same bodies that we had back when infant mortality rates were through the fucking roof. So you had the want to fuck all the time so that you can have a reasonable amount of people so that the human race could survive. You know, it was really cool common like back in the day for people to have 10 kids, 11 kids, 12 kids, they just kids, we're fucking dying, man. Kids didn't last. Then people got crazy diseases and it would wipe out entire villages and if animals were eating people on a regular basis, you know, so we have that same body and we want to fuck all the time.

Speaker 6:          00:51:50       Our body has not reacted to the, especially if you're athletic, it's one thing if you're unhealthy and if you, if you're confined to a cubicle and you know your body become sedentary, you, you'll lose a certain amount of that drive as you get your 30s or forties but if you're athletic, if you're athletic person and you have your personal, just the wheel hard engineered to like the hunt of it, the same way, you can't roll a ball of yarn in front of a kitten if a girl walks by, it doesn't even matter if you want to fuck her. If a girl walks by in high heels and a bikini with a big ass and big floppy real tits and she's hot and she looks at you, you go, oh, you just have to find a reason why you had to get out of the room.

Speaker 4:          00:52:31       Meanwhile, we are in queer becoming increasingly automated and computerized. And so what happened?

Speaker 6:          00:52:38       Worse than that, worse than that, we are because they're changing. Because the fact that pussy so powerful men are doing a lot of shit that women want them to,

Speaker 4:          00:52:47       right? It's not normal. But I would say that's also because testosterone, muscle aggression, those things are becoming um, uh, tools. We no longer need to survive. Think about what it was like just to get by and feed your family. You had to work the fucking land should split, would bale hay catch around food, all that shit. That took a lot of weight. And now what happens is you go to the supermarket and you swipe your credit card. Okay, so, so it, and I'm watching, I was watching two shows in particular. I watched Whitney and I watched American horror story. Okay. I like American horror story stories by the way. It's scary, but it has it. He has an affair. Oh, crystal is my buddy. But he has it. He has a, um, a bad is fair on a Whitney. I haven't, I don't, I mean, I don't mind that it's a sitcoms, actually not, it's actually never lie to me.

Speaker 4:          00:53:32       Like this actually has terrible, we go way back probably over a decade. This thing's going to be gone. I like the last topic, honestly. Like the laugh track. It's my favorite part. She's very pretty girl. I personally really like Whitney as personally I, you know, I'm biased, but someone about those billboards and made me feel like I was in a Coen brothers movie. I was like, I think this is it. I think this is the last piece of evidence that life is a work of fiction. It's like, what the fuck is happening? Just do not work for me anymore. I can not do that. But if you locked into a good one, if another Seinfeld, I mean modern family's funny. Yeah, I heard that's very typical. Sick on to backtrack studio audience supposed to be pretty good at. I was doing really well. So that's what Chelsea's Chelsea handler.

Speaker 4:          00:54:17       This Whitney's as well. She quit. Oh, that's right. Yeah. Oh yeah. It works her ass off. Man. That's crazy that she's got to show. I'm happy for it, man. I love her. I've known her forever and I knew her back when she was doing open mics, you know, and she, she worked her ass off man. And you know what about, we know what I love about Whitney Whitney. He's always been fucking really positive and really supportive. That's awesome. She's the girl. Well, I'd be on stage. She'd be out there laughing her ass off. Well, you don't get that everybody. How great. I was successful. You don't get that successful without being positive. It's impossible. Positive person who worked her ass off and guess what? I read the pilot of Whitney and and I was laughing and I was like, she wrote it, she wrote it. Now you stopped blowing and stuff saying it for a Sitcom and it might not be, you know, I'll just say it, I'm saying, but I'm proud of her.

Speaker 4:          00:55:04       I said, thanks. I think said it comes to the point I was making this, this is that w like Chris's character, it looks at a girl and for the whole episode she's giving him a hard time and he feels guilty and he can't admit that. He was just looking at for a girl and I was, I was saying it like that. I was like, look, the truth of the matter is we're fucking genetically programmed to be that way until they have an honest conversation about about what that struggle is for a guy, then we're always going to die because there's a struggle for a girl to, it's a respect issue and that's why I don't think that people looking at other people while you're in a relationship was cool while you're with someone, it's, it's the, you know what you're doing. You know, when, when, when a girl, like I've seen girls do it to dude's and it's very disturbing.

Speaker 4:          00:55:43       It's happened. Especially, it happens around a lot around fighters. Like, I'm not talking about that. I'm just talking about when, when it does happen, instead of pretending it didn't, or instead of saying that I don't feel that way, there is, there is a dialogue to be had, which is, which is, yeah. You know what, that's, that's the way when you get shit out in the open. Yeah. Yeah. It takes the edge off. It does, but it's a disrespect issue in the first place. You shouldn't be doing it. You shouldn't be staring at some chicks ass when you're in front of your wife. You know what the fuck it is. Just you know it's, it's easy to not do, you know it's easy to take it in for a second goat chase. I surprised and then don't say it don't, but don't fucking stair blatantly at some chick because you're just doing it to create conflict. You're doing it to make that girl feel bad and we've all seen guys do that. Sure.

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       We've all seen guys do that. Or it might even actually say something, you know that makes everybody, I'm so lucky I get the elbow to me like, Hey Brian, look at that girl's ass like it's backwards for me. What else we want to see before. But again, no, his girl does. She does lesbian motion, like seating box. That's fantastic. Don't have kids where they are but that's fantastic. Well you never know. You never know is riding on a grill. Give up on her pussy. They don't though. They just take a break and then when the 40 they kick you out of the house and move in with their horse trainer.

Speaker 2:          00:57:01       Yeah. That's what's going to happen, Bro. They'll tell you a couple of years off, you'll have kids with them and then when they're like 20 the kids or be like 20 if you do it with your eyes wide open, it might be a risk, but fuck it. Take it anyway and she's like, got a pass and she's all fucked up, but you liked her dater. We'll see. You might lose your house, but fuck it. You'll get another house. I don't know if he necessarily should be having children right now, but I see your point. There's no guarantee they'll guarantee, well, not only that, people do evolve. They do change. He, you can't judge everyone based on their earliest fuck up. We'd all be losing disaster. Compassion. Yeah. There's some sort of a time in between your fuck ups and who you are today that we have to accept.

Speaker 2:          00:57:42       I don't know what that number is. What a time machine. I'd go back and just meet me when I was 23 and slap my face with an open hand. Why would you do that? But it's perfect. What'd you've gotten through is absolutely perfect. You've gotten through it all with humility. It everyone's afraid of making those big colossal mistakes because they somehow know that define you. I say they don't. I say you're not your past. I say your accumulation accumulation of your experiences and what you've observed and learned in groove from your experiences and because of that you know, or how you've grown from your experiences. Because of that, you're better because of all your fuck ups. You should embrace them. If you, as long as you learn from your fuck ups, you're better because of them. I am unquestionably, I would not change a single thing about anything I've ever done ever.

Speaker 2:          00:58:24       I mean, I definitely feel bad for, I've ever hurt anyone's feelings at any point in time in my life. That's the number one thing. If anything I ever regret, it's like maybe I shouldn't have been so mean to that dude. Or maybe I shouldn't have yelled at this check or maybe I shouldn't. Maybe I should have like ate it before. I was just taking a look at where they're coming from. Perspective. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Or you know, instead of just said, shut the fuck up. I don't want to hear you. You know, those type of things but isn't, that isn't on what I chose to do. My regret is I didn't work hard enough and some things, you know, really. Yeah. A little bit. Well, like, I know what I don't know. I don't know. I don't think there should be because you've had a very enjoyable life and yet you have to realize is, you know, you, there's a certain amount of whimsy to your personality and to, uh, to what makes you a fun guy. And part of what makes you a fun guy is that you're never really truly satisfied with your current position in life. You know? But that's an interesting point. But like you like that, and I've never had anybody use the word whimsy. That's a ran of whimsy. I had a barrel chest. Oh, like think of yourself

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       on top of a fucking all day long boat with a broad sword. Whatever special is coming out in June. My one hour special on the cover of the DVD as me hold my eye. They made my muscles really big. I'm holding the Mike over man. And two girls are clutching. He's looking up at me and I'm on a mountain top. You fucking eyes. That's what I want to be. And there's a horse rearing off in the distance and a hawk in the air. I'm like, that's, that's what I want to be. Yes, it's true. I've always wanted to be, uh, you know, I've always wanted to be everybody. Everything. I'm not, but you know, in that sense, I kind of like who I am at the same time, that is who I am. But it is who you, why it's not true though. It's not, it's not a real need.

Speaker 4:          00:59:59       It's a whimsical fantastic is again, it is. If it is, it's, it's like he's like, he's being silly about it all. If you really truly wanted it, you would do it. It's like never take that motion that you have as a father. I see the devotion that you have for, for your work. When you're actually concentrating on something, when you actually want to do something, you're very focused on doing it. So it's kind of a fake. It is. It's almost an admiration for extreme examples of certain individuals and how inspiring. Like you meet a guy like Alister overing. You don't necessarily want to get that big, but God, Dan was inspiring. Oh, grab his fund. Giant Anaconda arm goes Gulf coast stuff. David off coast you, you're grabbing the guy's fucking arms. You don't even know the guy. You're grabbing his shoulders. I was Scott, who's out, who's grabbing, I'm putting [inaudible] and I was like, wow.

Speaker 4:          01:00:43       I was asking him about Brock Brock. I had to touch his body. I was like, well, look at this guy who made these people don't, you know, that's a, it's an interesting fight thing else. There's one of the best fighters in the world, but I think Brock is big as fuck in a serious restaurant, had a lot of respect for Brock. He says, you know, he says he's not ready for the fight, but I have a lot of respect for Brock. He's a great fighter, and I was like, whoa. He said that without cameras. It was just the fact that you can just go up to a guy like that and grab them, shows you where you're coming from because if you are weird in any way, you wouldn't be able to get that off. Now you can get that off because you're trying to make it happen every 10 minutes.

Speaker 4:          01:01:12       I get, same thing with mayhem. I'm always like trying to under hook them and he's like, you're crazy to think that you would ever want to do anything different because whatever you've done has made you, you, I, you know, I, I'm sorry for anybody that ever hurt their feelings, but I'm so happy everything turned out the way it, I guess you're right, man. I never thought of that, but I really liked that. As I was thinking, as you were talking, I went, I spent a lot of time wishing I was somebody else. That's why I'm an actor. That's my, I'm a comic, and by the way, that is who I am, isn't it? We don't want a guy who wishes he was, who spends a lot of time wishing it was somebody else. That's my identity. Every guy wants an undefeated record. Okay, but I'm telling you, that shit ain't good for you.

Speaker 4:          01:01:46       You have to understand what it's like to lose. Of course, you have to understand failure. You have to, you have to be able to look back in your past at a moment where you fuck something up and feel uncomfortable about it, and that should provide you with a certain amount of humility and they're just trying to understand it. I think a man is, is the product of what, partially a large but largely a product product of, of how of the actions he chose to take as a response to failure. You know? Yeah, for sure. I don't know how you learn anything other than the hard way. I don't, you don't, you don't

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       really look, we're, we're, we're a strange animal that's dealing with infinite variables. And the only way to truly find a focused way through this path is to have accumulated a massive amount of experiences and forged positive information and game plans from these experiences and be able to move forward. You cannot know it all right away from the get go. That's right. You know, just you, all you can do is control how you, how you respond to failure, what you choose to do differently, uh, readjusting your approach. And by the way, although the one thing for me is I've learned just to enjoy, enjoy that and allow the frustration, uh, what, how would you be able to make fun of yourself when you fuck up? How many, so you guys can do that. So huge. There was a guy, do you remember? It's so big and you're great at it.

Speaker 2:          01:03:07       There. There was a guy recently, I say recently, it was in, within the last couple of years. It was back when, uh, legends was at the, the old bomb squad on Santa Monica Boulevard where the two Jimmys to, yeah. Anyway, this guy picked up a hooker. I came back from Iraq, picked up a hooker. Turns out the hooker was a dude. The guy had sucked this deck for, I don't think I was a guy, shot him. Oh No. Dump the body in an alleyway and an alleyway like a movie. So the cops apparently see this guy dumped the body, the high speed, chase and sues. They chased them all the way up to the desert, gets out of the car with his gun suicide by cop. They shoot him dash wow. And all I'm thinking of is this motherfucker, if he could just make fun of himself, would have the best story ever. So true. The idea of the stubble and this guy did it really quiet. Suddenly. You don't know that story? No. Interesting. Well, if I may, if you play, can't believe, I've never told you this story. I can't believe you haven't eaten it. And you might have, I met, I'm a club USA

Speaker 5:          01:04:04       in New York City. How many years ago? Oh, I dunno. 20. Whoa. I don't know. I'm, I'm, I'm 63 now. You know, I've just had a lot of work done, but, um, uh, yeah, I'm, I'm a Ahmed USA. I'm a young man and, uh, I'm dancing and, uh, with my buddy and I meet this, I have a weakness for Latina girls, right? A little fatigue, curvy. I see this beautiful Latino girl. She's got this black pony tail. She's got, she's got that debt, caramel skin, this cute little ass. They're just getting hard. And I know, and this title, stop touching. She's dancing, she's dancing, she's dancing. She's, he said, stop, don't touch again. Sorry. She's dancing and she's dancing and she locks eyes with me with the eyes of a fighter. I mean, just looking at me and I'm like, all right, well that's my wife. That's my wife right there. I start dancing with her and we would dance one moment. She smells like fucking apricots. I don't remember what smells like, we're for the story. She smells like fucking apricots. And I'm just, um, does this, uh, we started making out and I mean Bob slapping on the dance floor and you know, sometimes

Speaker 4:          01:05:18       when you're that attracted, everything else melts away. You just see that one person. I'm a little drunk and I'm kissing her and romantic. I mean deep. Oh God. So there are these booths, there were these peak booths at Club USA where you could go in and there was a glass thing where other people can watch you. So I take this girl into the Pete booths and I didn't give a fuck as a glass so other people can watch and they want to come into the booth. They can watch. But nobody took care of freaky 20. No, 23. I didn't do what the fuck. I was like, I'll take my, I'm fucking fucking right here. Condom shot off. So I'm literally like, I'm going to fuck this girl right here in this club and you know, so you cuff me, go fuck yourself. I was just in love.

Speaker 4:          01:05:59       I'm going to get hurt. This is my girlfriend as well as my girlfriend forever. So I'm kissing and I'm making out. And I'm feeling a bodies, guys, little dance. I'm like, these are smaller. It doesn't matter. That waste so hard enough. The ask was on another level. I, yeah, she had a beautiful ass and I reached down and I go for, well I grab a grab a branch, I grab a fucking branch branch that had been talked under and she, he goes up and pulls my hand away and I immediately realize that was a cop. I've been, I've been deep kissing, deep kissing for two hours, so I'm definitely a little gay. I mean deep kissing and I just grabbed the cock. You ever thought or do you not know about the cock and tight? How did I not know, dude? Because she was, she was taking hormones obviously.

Speaker 4:          01:06:53       Secondly, she was already like, had that skin, Latino or Filipino, whatever she was where she just didn't have hair on her body. She was petite. He, I keep saying she's such a girl and you know, but here's this here, ready, here's the, here's why I'm a good guy. Here's why I'm a really fucking nice guy. Nope. I, I looked in her eyes. She was so hurt his eyes. He was so like, he was just like, please, you know, let this big and I'm such a fucking shit. Oh, I felt so bad that I go, I go back in to kiss her, I kiss her him for another like two seconds, three seconds. When I go on the lips, of course food. You fuckers now listen. Oh, I'm not ready. Ready, ready? I go, I go like this. I go, oh. I go, oh fuck. I have an old sir.

Speaker 4:          01:07:42       I have an ulcer in. My stomach is killing me. And she goes, you do? I go, yes. She goes, do you have to go to the bathroom? I go, no, no, no. I just have to. I have a very bad old sir. Sometimes it just keeps, so I want to protect her feelings. I felt bad him. His shit is and, and that's how I got out and I left and I never, I did not come back to that quote. I can't believe you went back in and you gotta be, I didn't want to be rude. No, wait a minute. Wait, a, I would have been the person, some person pretended to be a girl and tricked you into kissing him. Never even told you something that for a lot of guys would make them violence. I would've gave back for a lot of guys. I know, I know.

Speaker 4:          01:08:20       I would've been mad if, if, if this person [inaudible] guys, it's an experience. It's an experience. Well okay for you. But for a lot of guys it's an experience that they don't want to have and someone tricked them into doing it and they could get violent and I don't, I don't justify it. But I'm saying a lot of guys that would be the reaction. The fact that you felt bad. It's very strange. He went back. And then what are a poem? Did you ever the tongue after that? Uh, I don't believe a kissed with tongue, but if I tell the story again I'll definitely use that. I know. Isn't it funny how Lego a memory from that far back. It's almost bullshit anyway cause it's so like fragmented and odd. It's like I can recite the facts of a lot of details of my life, but do it truly recall them. And if I didn't have a language, they wouldn't even exist in my memory. But I'm tempted to tell you another story. I can do it. Yes, yes, please do this. That was pulled. Did I tell you that Jimmy Burke story? Which one? No, a million Jimmy Burke stories. The one where where we were both together with two girls on my bed. Yes, yes, yes. All right, that's good. Okay, so I had my best friend's thumb in my ass. All right. Uh, but that's a whole different story, Joe. What you put your thumb? No.

Speaker 4:          01:09:34       Did I tell him? I'll say my thumb. Let's be clear about it because we refer to each other as best friends. And I tell my thumb was never anywhere near the punchline away, but there's a very, very good excuse for it. Oh, well, should I tell him the podcast? It's a little late because you already gave away. The punchline is if you can tell the story somehow or another make it entertaining. Even though the punchline was already, I used to have ice date, I two girlfriends for a long time that I had sex with 10 years after the fact. They were just my two girls. Loved them, loved them. I had texted those girls, I, you know that we dated in college and then I dated them. We want to add right after college and and for the next 10 years, maybe longer. They were always a booty call and I was kind of, relationships are so strange, so weird.

Speaker 4:          01:10:19       Even through their boyfriends to girlfriends and we would always get crazy. Paul, how many, how many girls like that have a guy like that somewhere in their life where they just have some arrangements and they can always up places dirty. How can you tell? What do you cause they're there. They talk about him a lot because he's still in their life because he's still really important to them because they had a long time. I can always tell him, whoa, you're saying you could sniff it if a girl's doing it to you? You can tell. I mean, I know. And it doesn't give you like a nice green light though. You're like, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. You should be friends. You're automatically goes to, can assume that she's doing that. Just horr rampage was that with this one girl, right. Sorry about the training, but I was that with this one girl and she, um, hold on

Speaker 5:          01:11:14       one second is it's getting hot in here. I'm going to continue the story. I'm sorry for, I'll go slower Joe. So, so she um, she basically was, uh, uh, she, she, she was the girl. Both of them were, you know, my girls for a long time. They are down at a restaurant in New York City called [inaudible], which is a great restaurant by the way. And I get a call from one of them, which is essentially like, Hey Brian, it's such and such and such and such, and we're hanging out and we really wish you were here. And we were talking about you and we were talking, telling dirty stories, whatever they were saying and I, I couldn't call back fast and I was like, where are you? Like where are the Il Buco I'm like, I'll be there. I'll be there now. I mean I was literally like 20 minutes away and I got down there and five minutes I was, I was at his hand at the capitol.

Speaker 5:          01:12:02       I drive faster drive factor. I get there. Long story short, because I'm a team player, I call my best friend Jimmy Burke. I saw Jimmy, that's it. I called Jimmy Burke. I say, get down here. That by the way is always the code for fuck and there's something about to go down and it always involves pussy. Get down here. He goes, be right there guy. He's there in two seconds we'll drink and wine. I'm fucking getting them all applied up talking about it. I could see the two of them, the two girls are, are, are all over each other and I'm like, Oh, you want to use me as a bridge to have an experience with each other. How interesting. My two old girlfriends who subsequently asked me to have children with them, by the way, just to use my sperm, which was very flattering, but I had to say no.

Speaker 5:          01:12:44       But anyway, so, okay, so I'm like that Jimmy Burke goes, hey guys, let's go back to my, I call him the maestro. He goes, let's go back to my place. Let's go back to my place. I'll pull the fire, got some weed, I'll make some fucking chocolate chip cookies. How's that sound? We'd fireplace chocolates or cookies. They're like, uh, yeah. Okay, sounds good. We get to the place, he goes to the kitchen to get like to start whipping up chocolate chip cookies. He's bringing out some weed. He goes to, cause we bring brings out we'd, it brings out a joint. By that time, I'm already naked on the bed with the, with the girls. I'm already naked and he's like, what the fuck is this is?

Speaker 4:          01:13:23       And I'm like, oh my God, you no longer working my balls. I'm like, oh my look at you. I'm like, look at him. I go to, I go to Jamaica. I'd rather be nowhere else in the world right now, brother. This is the place to be. This is the greatest experience of my life. Literally like I'm living a porn right now and I love them. They're both my girls. So Jimmy's like, well, let me take my clothes off. He takes it. He looks like a red, bumpy pickled. By the way, he's fucking hairless. Got a piece on him and I'm like, that's just not attractive to me, but whatever. So he's trying to get this girl's pants down. He's getting it. He's trying to, and he's got a tongue literally that goes literally. He could catch fucking flies. He's like one of those frogs. Like people don't know what a entertaining dude, this guy he's got.

Speaker 4:          01:14:05       No, he's one of these guys. Like there's certain people that it you, you, they go from cradle to the grave. They never become famous. And it's a national disaster. It's a tragedy we call national tragic, calm, the national treasure. He's the greatest. He's hilarious. He's incredible. He's a Joey Diaz type character is one of those dudes. It's just fucking hilarious. Like you're so happy. You know him cause you're always laugh when you're around him because he, because he rides around because it's Christmas time. He goes, come outside. I go, well he's driving down fucking 57th street with a cowboy hat on of down fest in the middle of winter with no fucking pants on. And I hear him go, that goes with bowls of holiday. Oh and this woman goes and screams because he's driving, standing up on the pedals and it's God is going on 57th street in the middle of the, I used to, I was like, you're the craziest motherfucker.

Speaker 4:          01:14:54       He was three blocks away from his house. There was a restaurant that we stopped. I stopped going to, I'm going to stop going to this restaurant because the last time I went was with you and Jimmy and the fucking waiter kept interrupting Jimmy Stories with some newer bullshit plate that they're bringing over with some fucking description of where the olives came from and how the cheese is cured. And Jimmy's telling some crazy fucking post nine 11 horror story. You know about like hearing the bodies hit the ground and this motherfucker comes over with a plate of cheese. This cheese is a book too from South America and it's, it's a type of cheat to see what that Yak milking. Get the fuck out of here, man. Put the stuff down and let's be done with this. There's nobody who tells better stories neck. So entertaining. It was just bums me out.

Speaker 4:          01:15:43       Well, the, that a guy like that sort of, well, you know what though? He always says that he goes to life is my tapestry. He just has such a blast. He does always makes it a good time no matter where that fucking guys, he's, he's, he's taken this girl's pants down. He's trying to get as taste frog tongue in there. She's cheese trying to go down the other girl. So she's more than the other girl as I'll Megan. Oh yeah, go on. I'm like, Oh, is that my cock glare? As you know, I'm just a fucking, I'm sorry to be graphic, but the point is, it was just a fucking craziness. Okay. So, so he, he's trying to get a sense and she stops. She goes, wait, hold on. I don't like this. You guys need to, you guys need to get, do something together.

Speaker 4:          01:16:19       I, I don't, I don't like to say I look at Jim and we'd go, oh, we don't do that. I don't do that. See, I don't fuck around with guys because it's not that I'm homophobic, just not attracted to guys. And I definitely have a hard on right now. And so it was my buddy and there's no fucking way that's bad enough. We're about two feet away from each other. I'm not doing anything with my buddy. And this is the girl that Jimmy was trying to eat out, right? Like in Jimmy, right? No, she wanted to really, she was more into the girl she was into, you know, so, so, um, so she says, so she says to Jimmy, she goes, and Jimmy could give a fuck. He, he, he doesn't give a shit. He's down to go. And if he has to fuck me in the ass to get to this, he's going to, he's like this. I can see the look in his eyes and he's fucking like, let's go. Let's go. What the fuck do you need me to do? I want you guys to make out that we had done a play. We wrote a sketch where we, where we make guys, Joe. And I go, no, no, no. I don't make out with guys. It's disgusting. Can't do. I can't do it. I had to do it. There was,

Speaker 7:          01:17:15       you said you wrote a plate that you guys, I wrote this player. We can make out. I can't, I can't make out with doers. But I did write this play where I make out with every letter. And it's unfortunate that it had to be that way. They had to make out with a guy. But I mean that's just, that's what I wrote that I wrote. It's called kissing a boy. But the point is this, um, skills, one of my dick hard. Why am I crying?

Speaker 4:          01:17:41       Okay, let's call. Why am I crying your wife? Anyway, so, so, uh, so before I can even do it, Jimmy goes, I'll fucking kiss him. Good Kick Egos. Get over here. You fucking pussy. I don't know Jada.

Speaker 7:          01:17:52       Oh Man. He goes, he pulls me away. You happy?

Speaker 4:          01:17:55       She goes, yeah, oh it goes down. And I'm like that. So now I'm back to my girl, I'm back to my girl and where we're locked in and we're making out and all of a sudden I feel the other girls, I feel the other girl's ass hand around my ass cause he feel good, Brian. I'm like, I feel fucking good. All of a sudden I feel like I'm not a, I'm not an ass play guy to be honest with you, but I feel like my finger go on and my mom, my mom was so let you will, if I can general chip you, but, and I'm looking at, I'm going to sue a pickle up there, you know what I mean? So, yeah. So I'm like, I'm like, uh, okay that, oh well the book, she goes, I feel good. I go, Oh, I guess, oh, you're a girl.

Speaker 4:          01:18:35       I wouldn't go, well, you know it went in Rome. I'm like, AH, fuck off. And I'm just so on. And then, and then I find, then I feel what feels like a greyhound bus in my ass. You understand a greyhound bus in my ass to which I go, oh, like that. Exactly what I went, oh like that. And I turn around like this. I'm stuck. I all, I can do this on my back. I turned, I go, oh, I like that. And my buddy's got his thumb and my ass, and he goes like this. He goes, you fucking pussy.

Speaker 7:          01:19:06       Oh, you know what had me style. Let me explain. Let me explain. Let me explain. Let me explain why and how she said

Speaker 4:          01:19:16       the ham. I'm not going to do any more. I will fuck you, but you have to stick your finger in his ass. Do you don't have the balls. And Jimmy goes, what? I don't know. Fuck the fuck you shut the fuck.

Speaker 7:          01:19:27       Yay. She give a shit. It's like, hey guys, I mean a little something here. I understand wanting to get laid, but the stick your finger in my fucking house. I go, I go, here's the problem. I got to tell them otherwise we're gay. I tell all your friends and tell everyone in the world, I sold a half a million people on the podcast. Hey, you know what? There it is. I told, I was told my friends in New York,

Speaker 4:          01:19:47       we told the story, they went like this, my buddy like German fat and they, they, they, they, they had their hands in their pocket. They are listening. They just went, fuck this.

Speaker 7:          01:19:58       You wouldn't have talked to me shaking their head in a bad mood. Can I fly Jimmy out here? Yeah. Has Him on the podcast? Yes. Okay. The next time

Speaker 2:          01:20:08       you do the podcast, let's, let's schedule it in like three or four weeks from now, somewhere before thanksgiving. You come out to do the podcast. We'll fly Jimmy out from New York. If he can do it. Great idea. I'll put them up in a hotel. The whole deal. You stay out here for a few days. Okay, beautiful. Perfect. I remember the first time I met Calvin, I was sucking his Dick and uh, wait a minute. But you were wearing a blonde, right? Don't you think it, this shows me the gay enough wage. You want to, what made you want to take it deeper? It was these brain alpha brain shit works son. Hey, I'm, have you heard about Trey Parker and Matt Stone being investigated by Scientology for the last five years? Have you heard of those? For what? No, I haven't heard anything about it. Yeah. Well you know, they made fun of the whole Tony I believe is crap.

Speaker 2:          01:20:50       Yeah. Has a really big article about it. You know, and in some way, and this is, this is going to sound weird because I'm a huge south park fan and I, I'm on their side 100% but there's a thing about having a gang, like the Scientologists behind you. The must be pretty fucking bad ass. I mean, you think about it. Look, I don't, I don't buy into any ideology. I don't believe anything that you can't show me. I will entertain almost any offer except religions made by science fiction authors. There's a certain, and a certain point in time I step away and I go, wait, wait, wait, what? But it has a, as a group and as a clan, let's call them a clan of people. Yeah. I respect that. They fucking stick together like that. People love being in solidarity with other groups of people, whether it's occupied Wall Street, whether it's, you know, I mean, I respect people don't respect is when people use, um, what, when people use lawsuits, abuse, use litigious behavior to try it,

Speaker 5:          01:21:51       intimidate and, and, and

Speaker 2:          01:21:53       scare people from taking a look at them and that, that's what I am. I don't know. I don't know if that's what they're doing inside and talk to, well, you know, look, Matt stone and Trey Parker or they're too big. You know what? I know Scientology can shut down some, some shitty writers or some, some unknown people or some people that haven't been established by the media, but those guys have a voice. You can't silence, then you're just not going to make it way worse. You start picking on those guys, make it way worse. I know buddy. Fuck you up like they do like what are they doing to treasure? Like what's this like? Are they just pointing magnets towards their house? They're like, you know, I actually know a lot Scientologists

Speaker 5:          01:22:33       cause I took class at the Beverly Hills Play House and uh, for a while there, there were a lot of them in it and some of the teachers and one of the teachers that I've said something really cool, he goes, somebody asks me if I was assigned to us and he had been for 23 years and he had a good answer. He said, have I taken classes there and gotten immense benefit from some of them. Yes. Have I taken classes there and got nothing out of them? Yes. He goes, if that makes me a scientologist, whatever has ra Elouan Hubbards dianetics and different philosophies helped me a great deal of my life in some ways. Yeah. And it was kind of a good answer. He goes, it's a, that helps me a lot.

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       But when he did in creating his own religion is used a lot of excellent principals from a bunch of different ideology takes responsibility for yourself as a lot of it is good. All the positive thinking and you know, and there's something to be said for his way of thinking about reprogramming your psyche and reprogramming your reward system, attitude and belief and you know, and, and just just moving forward in a positive direction. Very strong, very important aspects of life. I think so 100% I think that w, you know, one of the things is just looking at yourself and saying, okay, whatever happens, you can always make an excuse. Whatever happens, I'm responsible for every condition on him. It's a better way to go through your life even if you're not. So what? It doesn't matter. Just move on to the carrots, move off to get my shit.

Speaker 2:          01:23:50       What, what the excuse is. You can have the best cause Houston world. The problem is the world goes, I know. That's terrible. Next, next. Well, some people just need an ideology and that ideology works, you know? And I, I like I had a next door neighbor who was a scientologist. It was a nice fucking guy. They were really nice family. I always enjoy talking to them. I know a lot of them, I've met a lot of them and, and uh, I've never had a problem with them. But I absolutely agree with you when it comes to them lawsuits and people critiquing them or criticizing them and them going after people, you know, I gotta let that shit go, man. That's probably, you know, they're bullies. They're the powerful few people in power who, who, who are doing these kinds of things. It doesn't necessarily mean that everybody, you know, it's not, it's not an indictment by the, you know, by a few.

Speaker 2:          01:24:35       Right, right. Well, you know, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know the real numbers, but it is a fascinating thing to me that, that it is possible to do something like that. But it also is very Coen brothers ask, you know, it's also very much like another piece of evidence appointment to the idea that the entire world that we live in is a work of fiction. It's not real. It's a part of my imagination because otherwise, why would this really exist? Why would actress be so vapid? I mean, if you ever met actors when you, you're on the senior working with them and you'd go into and go, this isn't even real. There's no you guys, you went too far. This is not believable. What Daniel Day Lewis, there's a great interview where he said, Dan Daly was said the funniest thing because I think he's an incredible actor, right?

Speaker 2:          01:25:15       So I started like kind of like researching them and stuff. I just, he's amazing. We've talked about on the podcast, so a thousand times he said, you know, you guys want to know about my process. He said, you know, I stuck flowers at my jacket, did cartwheels. It wouldn't really matter. The bottom line is this. I sit around all day wearing somebody else's clothing, having somebody else's thoughts, saying somebody else's words and trying to believe all of it basically because I am at heart, a boring Middleclass Englishman, I think he said because I'm ashamed of being basically a boring middle classes. It was a great answer because he just, he, he looked at the absurdity Christian Bale. They were like, why do you lose weight so much since then? He goes, because I'm a man and I put makeup on and I make believe for a living and I got to make it.

Speaker 2:          01:25:56       I gotta make it feel like real work, you know? I got it so I can close to dying when he did the machine. That's ridiculous. I've never seen a transformation like that. You know, a lot of people like were, I remember back in the day when people were first starting to do that, Robert Deniro was one of the first guys to put on weight for a movie for raging bull and I was like, wow, he really got fat for that movie. Like that's crazy. And I read about his diet. It was just eating like a regular Italian, just fucking meatballs and Pasta all day. And um, you know, and everybody was like, wow, that's amazing. But with Christian Bale did was a thousand times harder. He literally almost starved himself to death. Credible. That guy is fucking incredible. Yeah. It's like, you remember that that below out when he was on were they kept playing in our radio stations where he was yelling at some guy on the set.

Speaker 2:          01:26:38       It's cause it kind of sets a fucking idiot. He's right. If you're operating on that level of frequency where you need to really believe that you're in this scene and some asshole keeps walking around, tweaking things in, in, in your, in your line of sight. But that's not supposed to be there. It's maddening. And everybody knows that one pastory motherfucker that you can work with the whole fucking anywhere his face for the rest of his life. But it's hilarious that they released that. They're, they're released that and look, yeah, he was going crazy. But one of the things what he was saying, it's you, you're not fucking professional. He goes, you're a nice guy. You're a nice guy, but you're not fucking professional man. He's right. You know, you, you, you reach a certain level of intensity, emotional intensity. When you do a role like that.

Speaker 2:          01:27:21       Again, I'm just totally talking out of my ass. I was just as a zookeeper, I was at a child or your various, my big, my big park. But there's a certain intensity that you reach when you're, you're putting yourself into a part like that and you see some guy walking around in the background, tweaking the fucking lights right in front of your eyes. Like, come on dude. Really? I could the fuck are you doing Bob? Put the lights down. Get the fuck Outta here. Yeah. If you're trying to be great, what he's trying to do is that somebody is fucking buzzing around. You can understand it, but we allow them to do like a Batman movie. You're allowed to do those piece of shit when it was needed to make that money. Son, I'm going to come back and do something else crazy. He's fucking amazing.

Speaker 2:          01:28:00       So this is only a few of those guys. You know, there's a few of those Russell Crowe's out there that really become a different guy. You're like Russell Crowe and the insider, so one of my favorite movies because movie scary fucking movie man. When you find out how much of it is based on reality, how terrifying it is, how much power that tobacco companies have, and that's sort of like what's going on. My thoughts about this whole occupy Wall Street thing, when you look at banks and hedge fund companies and all these is this corruption and the financial situation that we have right now. You look at it and you're like, man, these people have been getting away with so much for so long. It's like telling them that everything has to be fair now. They're like, fuck you. Like I made him get into this. To be fair, I got into this because I met my friend Tim at school and he was two years ahead of me and he brought me out in a limo with coke and hookers and they said, listen bro, we're trading stocks were shortened things. We're making millions. We got this fucking town wired and you're like, mmm, I want in. And then you'll all get together in the 80s, Gordon Gekko style and start fucking raping the financial system. That's why the day in the first place, they're there to make

Speaker 6:          01:29:02       as fuck tons of money through every possible loophole. Did you read about one of the CEO's wives, um, who uh, got some of the government bailout money to start a new business like $250 million in loans from some fucking guy. He's got like billions of dollars. It's amazing. His wife, he had his wife do a twosome snazzy loophole that they engineered into the system. You start to feel invincible on it. So amazing. Well, look, when the old, the president, the United States, when you know how much they own shit, when the president of the United States says, ladies and gentlemen, poor suffering people of our country, I am going to take billions of dollars of your tax money and I'm going to give it to these cunts that ruined these banks. And I'm real sorry about this. But they get bonuses and their bonuses are going to be roughly half of what you're going to make in your entire life.

Speaker 6:          01:29:52       It's going to be a half a million dollars is what? We're going to put a cap on it. That's the cap he was trying to put on it. It was like when to put a half a million dollar cap that's there's no buddy. Your bank is done. You can't give a bonus if there's no money. You don't have a bank anymore. The reason why you have a big is cause you took our fucking taxes and you throw it back into your system and now everything's spinning and you want to shit out. Bonuses. What kind of contract do you have where you have a bonus when the bank breaks, right. It literally breaks. I will say it, but how old? I mean what, what message are they telling us? When the president tells all the poor people of this country with the middleclass is falling apart. Poverty is an all time level high. Exactly four 47% of all of Detroit. You're literate. I mean literally the infrastructure, everything's falling apart and he's like, I'm going to limit it to a half a million dollars. Like, but first of all, first of all, you can't, you can't, you can't eliminate it.

Speaker 5:          01:30:42       Thing on. The other thing is that, the other thing is that, um, I think at the end of the day, the, the, the um,

Speaker 6:          01:30:48       I went to occupy Los Angeles last night. What do you mean you can't limit anything?

Speaker 5:          01:30:51       Well, well, w w well, the, when you, when you, what, what banks will say is when you give that money, when you give that tarp money to a bank and they're going to use it for various things there, they're using it to operate their business, to keep their business afloat. And the PR, the biggest problem was that these banks came to that to someone like Obama. Well, actually not to Obama and Bush,

Speaker 4:          01:31:12       he's the fucking president. He goes to them and says, listen, no bonuses. You fuck you still wait. He's not allowed to get away with it. In other words, [inaudible] who is the fucking president? Know what I'm saying? Was running shit. That's tells you the banks. Yeah. The Bay from the banks were too big to fail and that's the biggest problem. When you have a bag that's a philosophy esophageal it maybe, but when you have a bank, when you have, when you have a situation where most economists are saying that the president look, the central nervous system of this economy is going to collapse if you don't, I'm not saying this is good. I understand the arguments for the bail. His problem is that these fucking, these banks weren't dealing with their own money there. We did. They were taking risks with your money. That is a huge problem and it is a huge problem, but that's not my point. My point is that you have these giant bail them out

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       and they were still giving them bonuses. Exactly. Doling out bonuses, how blatant it is. The way they justified it was this. They said, if we don't give bonuses and those guys will go to other corporations and we'll go under suck my cock. I will say that the banks have paid back all that money though, which is pretty impressive. That is pretty crazy. It just shows you how quickly they've been stealing left and right. Good deal. Good government made a lot of interest on that. So every bank has paid back. The money has been paid back and they made a lot of interests. So why is the economy fixed? The economy is not fixed. I think primarily because it was fake. No, I think that I think that the U S is having to compete with China and India and a lot of other countries and we are truly becoming a global economy and I don't think in a lot of ways to u s has gotten ready for that, but we're not making anything other than Corvettes.

Speaker 2:          01:32:45       What else do we make this about? As we made Corvettes and catalogs still our economy actually still is run on ideas. Although I have a Mustang, I have to say it's pretty fucking bad ass. Do you us the US exports ideas. The U s is an ideal kind of economy and that's good thing to be. We remember it most. Most innovation by leaving shot comes out of the United States in the Mustang is an idea. I have a gt 500 it's paper. It's a stupid car. It's got a manual transmission with a cue ball for a shifter. It's got a 540 horsepower engine. Oh my tires slide all over the place. Whenever you hit the gas tile tire slide in second year all the time. It's a ridiculous car, but it's fun as fuck and it's it truly American car, like you hear it, the engine, the ridiculousness of excessive nature, all of it and the end, the fun of it.

Speaker 2:          01:33:31       It's got a lot of low end torque. You know, you hit that low end torque on a big fucking eight with a supercharger and hear the whine. The U s exports, a lot of of ideas there. I'd and fun. They're culture is fun. Rock and roll is not the only reason why our culture is fucked up or rather our financial systems fucked up. It's fucked up because of corruption and greed and what you said earlier, which I always say as well, it should be real clear. One piece of gold eagles, one donkey. That's my standard way of when you start getting into derivatives and shorting and gambling. I mean what does that is the Vegas, you're, you're, you're going Vegas, gambling. But then there's also but there is room, there is room to levers, there is room for borrowing, borrowing and credit. Yes but why is there room for things like derivatives and shorting and why are they allow

Speaker 5:          01:34:18       relatives and stuff? What back when it was working a lot of those derivatives and things like that allowed people well allow people, allow people to minimize risk so that banks would lend money cause they could minimize risk was distributed and and as long as that was self contained, they drew it know, put a lot of, put a lot of our wealth back into the system. I think what happened ultimately was a lot of economists and historians are starting to talk about this was also a function of the rise the east. It was also a function of the fact that other countries were buying and investing in the US housing market. Think about it. If you have big, big central banks who are saying, we want to buy your housing debt, what happens? That means I can bundle bundle

Speaker 4:          01:34:58       mortgages and sell them at a profit. Guess what? It makes it a lot cheaper now. Now when people get a mortgage, it's worth something. Of course I'm going to lend you a mortgage for no money. I can make money on the mortgage, I can serve with Germany, and a lot of it was that a lot of it was people in this country, a lot of whom you and I know who said, I'm going to start treating my house like it's a commodity. Not, not like it's a place to live, but rather a plate, a way to make money, and that was pretty fucking rampant. So a lot of this was human overreaction to a new set of rules to a new world

Speaker 7:          01:35:29       and just fucking human nature, human nature. When they find holes in the system, the Brian's, you were saying that you went to occupy Wall Street. What was that? Yeah, it was. It was exactly what I thought I was going to be. What was crazy is that I, I have these combat boots, like these, those a safari combat boots. I bought it at a surplus store. So I did they think you are a government decided to wear them because of that reason? Really the, I don't know, just for fun government issue boots. So I would think that you're a bad guy. Yeah. Just to see what would happen. And uh, so I parked and amazingly I got a parking spot right across the street from it. Yeah. None of them have cars. Yeah, no, no. It was like this cop car pulled out right when I got there.

Speaker 7:          01:36:06       And so like all these people were kind of, you know, like boards sitting on the line staring at me so I could come up in her is like people getting their tits painted and I'm like, this is awesome. Good. Yeah, that's good. And then immediately I pull out my phone and this guy comes up right up to me and goes, hey man, can I have a cigarette? Like right in my face? Like, like, uh, he looked like Charles Manson and I was like, Oh shit. This is a yeah, sure. Got, get out of my face, you know, and then I keep on walking. I'm looking at my phone now, I'm kind of freaking out a little because I'm by myself and it's, it is a little, I mean, I don't know if you've ever been downtown Los Angeles, it's kind of scary down. Yeah. We've come a lot of fear factor episodes down there.

Speaker 7:          01:36:39       Yeah. So there was kind of like this element around that area that's like, hey, there's a new apartment complex opening up for the homeless people type thing. You know, it was, cause it was like a village. They had, first day they had libraries, they had a, you know, they had donate, there's donations coming in that feed like this whole entire like block, uh, you know, of the State Capitol building or whatever. Right. And, uh, then this other guy kind of staring at me and he comes up to me and goes, hey man, can you check the score for me? And I'm like a square for wet. And he goes, Pittsburgh. And I'm like, uh, I have no idea what he's talking about. Like, I'm like, ah, so he's asking you check it on your phone. Yeah. You're asking people to Google shit for it. Can I get a cigarette's not good enough.

Speaker 7:          01:37:21       Now can Google me the score. I have a cell phone and the whole time he's like staring my phone down. So I think maybe some high government issued boots and it was like trying to figure out, cause I had like a shaved head, like a military haircut. Oh. And wearing the coat from taxi driver or whatever. You know, obviously we had Kevin Pereira from attack of the show on here the other day and we were talking about agent provocateurs, government people who were sent in to break up calm protests and turn them into violent protests. They can bring him in fucking arrest her. But it's common tactic. It's smart. Really. They get tired. All these fucking hippies in their banjos. So this guy's kind of frequently to look out for them. Uh, I've been impressed with how, um, when I hear the occupy Wall Street people, a lot of them are people who are actually educated w who just can't find a job.

Speaker 7:          01:38:02       Yeah. And I'm trying to find the answer in the case as much as I thought it wouldn't be. This was mostly, by the way, we're not in Wall Street. No, it doesn't really have a financial, I mean it's just a small financial district, but it smelled like, I don't even know where he would occupy downtown law by Los Angeles. He's got clothing companies and the government buildings. So this guy is like kind of freaking me out. Like it's like checking me up and down and stuff like that. And I'm like, all right, this is kind of sad. You get for trolling. I fuck. I know, I know. But then my friend who's running like the, the live stream and all the media coverage of the whole place, he called me over and so kind of rescue me. And so I go through was like my friend, see, hang, he's a c hung on a Twitter.

Speaker 7:          01:38:47       Uh, so, uh, there was a rap battle going on up on stage because there's entertainment throughout the day. There's speakers, there's like local musicians and comics, you know, like Jeffrey Ross, Jeff, yeah. And so, uh, it was fine. I sat there and watched this rap concert for why were they, people are handing off the mic and this homeless guy was like looking guy with like balancing like pop cans on his head while rapping. I was like, wow, you don't see this everyday. You know. So it was like the entertainment value, it's pretty sweet. Smelled like boo though like crazy. And then they took me through the media event where they do all the live interviews and all the media stuff and it's all like generators and solar collectors. And then there's tons of computers and then there's this girl is just out of nowhere comes up to my friends see and was like, Hey, I want to donate these laptops and gave him like three laptops.

Speaker 7:          01:39:35       And I was like, wow, this is really bad ass. I need to start occupying Burbank outside of best buy or something, you know, and get some shit. Uh Oh Brian, silly. But then they took me through the whole thing and there was like drums, drum circles. There was like it, it seemed pretty cool. And I guess that I've never seen a good drum circle. Never been there. Well I fucked this. Is this PLO drums and if anything it seems like the more I walked around I, I did see like the people trying to sit down and come up with, with solutions and ideas. So you did see the good part of what's, but the majority of it was just like, it looked like a bunch of deadheads. I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I think that's just going to be the case no matter what with any sort of a movement.

Speaker 7:          01:40:15       But this was a very exciting time, man. There's never been a time where this many people have got together and had a peaceful demonstration. It was pooping in a shit. Shitting in the street is not exactly a peaceful, he's a little bit of violence involved in that. But you know the, they're shitting all over the fucking street. You go anywhere near Wall Street. Yeah, the shitting. Oh God. It smells like human shit everywhere. I felt like such an ass, cause I had a tin can and there was this, there's three different colors of trash cans. Like the green trash. It's black and the blue. Oh, I'm sitting here going, which one is it? Green is green as grass blue. What's blue? That's waiting. It's like water bottles. And this is a can is a black. I just throw it. So I'm like trying to figure it coated. They didn't have

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       like, it didn't save her. It was a green trashcan of blue. Oh, that's ridiculous. I think it's supposed to be. You're supposed to know the colors. Human Shit still bothering. Yeah, they shit everywhere man. Well they have to, you know, there's a lot of people sleeping there, but people have their kids there and everything. Port-A-Potties this is, yeah. Then sometimes they can't. Okay. But this again, we're talking about the Los Angeles. Los Angeles one is a different animal than the write up one New York one man, the videos in New York one is there really a shocking, and here's what's really crazy. The Wall Street, uh, has a, not only have they donated four point $6 million to the police, but they also started hiring the police. It's something that most people don't know. You can hire a police officer for roughly $37 an hour. So all of these Wall Street firms are hiring tons of cops off duty cops to do, uh, you know, paid work there.

Speaker 2:          01:41:40       And they work as a police officer with a real badge and a real gun and the real ability ability to arrest. But they're working for the bank. So the, they, it's a, it's a loophole where these are police officers, but they are doing the bidding of the bank. They are doing that. They're working for the bank. They're not like the bank says, Hey, uh, police officers, can you organize your own police presence around this area? And, you know, put as many police officers you see fit and I guess you guys work for the state and you know, maybe we'll, uh, we'll, we'll throw in a picnic for ya and we'll help generate some money to pay for all this extra revenue that's going to cost. They're paying, but they're paying the cops so they tell the cops where to go. I didn't know it. It's, it's fucking crazy. I was legal. It's, yes, you should think it shouldn't be, but it was a I, I think a Koch Mayor Koch came up with that. I think it was in the 90s that they had that. Yeah, I think the biggest, you know, and people have always had it.

Speaker 5:          01:42:36       I think the biggest threat facing all of us is as far as this whole situation talking about this, I think the real enemy is that we are slowly or maybe very quickly losing our representative government. And what I mean by that is that this, this government and James Madison warned warned about this. He said, the one thing you have to be careful of in a democracy like this is special interests because, because the constitution says you are allowed to petition your government, that's a constitutional right. It should be a constitutional right. The problem is that our country now is being run by small bands of very energetic, well-financed fanatics. And, and when you are a representative in the House of Representatives, if you are a congressman, if you are even a senator, but especially in Congress, you don't do a goddamn thing unless you check what that lobby and checking unless you check with the people that finance your campaign and the people that have real power in Washington, our fundraisers and lobbying groups. Now, James Madison said, what's going to happen is these lobbyists, lobbyists will offset each other with their different, and it'll be competing interests and stuff hasn't happened. In fact, what seems to be happening is that some of these groups have so much fucking money. And if you look at Potomac where they're all live, or just Washington area, that is, that is the highest per capita income in the country. Why do they produce.
