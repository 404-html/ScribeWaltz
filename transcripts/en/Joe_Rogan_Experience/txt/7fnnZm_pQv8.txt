Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Oh Shit, we're live beatboxing. Brian Cowen shows another hidden skill and this last weekend we just learned he speaks fluent gay rapist. French said play when I'm in the hardest things I ever laughed at. Is You doing your French rapist character? Yeah, I'm talking to Steven about. Explained to him how to. I'm assuming you were saying tightened up his ass because you are going to come inside of it something. You're doing it all. Did it all in perfectly. Enunciated French. That's right. I think he shocked him. I think he did. He was crying. He was laughing so hard. He was actually the does the camera guy who the camera guys who are pros. These guys are Goddamn pros. They. They keep it together. The guy gave in and was laughing out loud while holding the camera, like he couldn't help it. We were all crying and also he knew this was never gonna.

Speaker 1:          00:00:53       Get on the fucking sportsmans channel. It's not going to get on channel, but I wish they would release it on the web. The ravine comer. Why don't we have the we there? The footage is there. I think there's some concern that the hunt and folk would abandon us all because French rapists folk don't like these Goddamn comedians coming in and gang up are fine. American pastime, hunting folk, some of the hunting folk look, most hunting people are like most people, most people are cool as fuck. I maintain this. I really do believe this. I believe that most people are great. It is a very small percentage of people. It took me a long ass time to figure this out. Just the sheer numbers. It's just that when something goes wrong, it's so disturbing for us that we get upset and we lump all other folks into the same category that that person came from almost to protect ourselves and we know it's a prejudice and like having a prejudice towards people who live in the south or having a prejudice towards anything.

Speaker 1:          00:01:59       It's all the same. Any kind of prejudice like it's not going to spend another 10 team. Their fans is not a nicer prejudice because they just have a southern accent and they lived down there and you just think it's cute to think they're retarded. No, that's Goddamn prejudice. Those are people, right? If you thought they were tardy because they were black, you'd be as a piece of shit. Right? Right. But you can think that they're retarded just because they talk like this. Like some of them that talk like this are actually super intelligent people as they choose to keep their accent. I've spoken to professors that are like a strong Houston, Texas accent and guy was genius as fuck. Exactly smarter than me. We are. We are tribal. People are just trial and it's really easy to do that. Those guys over there, I don't like people from West Virginia or whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:02:43       I don't like them. God Damn. Comedians are smoking weed and they're talking hunting and that's not what hunting is about. What hunting is about is how I do it. I get up in the morning and I faced the east and it was that Muslims. Now that's Muslim. See now you're a trader and now you just expose yourself. No, no, no, no. I meant I praise Jesus to the east, west, north, and south. You said ease major. I'm not an. I swear to God. I am not a pale face. Terrorists was that expression. There's an expression, oh, clean skin, clean face, clean, clean skin, and terrorists. I don't know. I haven't heard of that. Expression is for like the Timothy Mcveigh, the ones that you don't see coming because they look like, like fashion American boys. Yep. What is the term so you can find with that term?

Speaker 1:          00:03:27       As chairman? Alicia is a good thing. It's called clean skin terrorist. That's what they. They think of as like some homegrown nutty dude. I was listening to this fucking radiolab podcast about these dudes. These white supremacists do that. We're planning this mass murder and they were infiltrated by the FBI. Jesus. It was fascinating, man. God Damn that National Public Radio podcasts, radio labs. One of the best things ever. Not just like on podcasts, but as far as like as move. If it was a movie, it would be one of the best things that it was a TV show. It'd be one of the best things I you. You turned me on to. Things were haunting Dan Carlin's hardcore history. I'm obsessed. By the way. Do you want to talk about a guy doing the world of service? If you want to learn history and you're talking to a history major, I read all the books, blah, blah, blah.

Speaker 1:          00:04:12       I take courses from the teaching company. If you want to learn history, go to Dan Carlin's. Hardcore history. I have never. I've listened to great professors. I've never heard anybody kind of break down the history as a story where you just can't wait for the next podcast and then radio lab, which I've always listened to npr and sometimes they have those on there, but radiolab is pretty amazing. It's off the charts. Amazing. It's so good. So it is cleaned skinned. A clean skin terrorist is a potential attacker with a spotless record whose documents don't arouse suspicion. Wow. Well you gotta think like every terrorist, every dude who blows a fuse, there has to be like there's a moment where you could get to a certain age, you can be like pretty nutty and get to a certain age without a criminal record and then you all the time.

Speaker 1:          00:05:00       You're like building up for the one big nutty event. Those are the scary guys that inside live inside and then they're just waiting for action. Yeah, they. They're terrified and they just. They're fantasizing that going over in her head, going over their head and then they finally explode. Now how did those guys get made? Is that nature and nurture? Isn't that? Isn't that the ultimate question? Because if we could stop all people that would wantonly want to create war for profit. If we could stop all people that would act in the name of global aggression for financial gain. If we can stop all that, we would all do it and then we'd have a way crazier world if we had a world where everybody was basically really nice. Yeah. I mean, although, although you're, you're suggesting in the way you framed that as you're. You're assuming that people that are aggressive or create aggression or the are the aggressors are doing it only for. A lot of people think this only for certain

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       negative things like a money conquest territory that the problem is that aggression, a lot of times can be fostered in groups of people if they think that another country is actually going to hurt them in the future. It can be very much useful in a self defense capacity or at least justified that way and always has been. Absolutely. And so I don't think you'll ever get. I don't think you'll ever get rid of aggression and you probably shouldn't. I think it's part of the order of the universe I bought. What I think you have to do is this. The biggest threat is, you know, one thing that's always kind of confounding about life is that it takes so long to build something. It takes so long to build a complete human being. It takes so long to build something like the Sistine Chapel and it's so easy to destroy one motivated fanatic with a, you know, a large enough bomb on his back.

Speaker 2:          00:06:50       He could blow up, you know, St Peter's Cathedral or could kill. I don't know how many people. And that's what's so hard is that the things that take so long to build are so easy to destroy and it, as technology grows it, it's going to become more and more a factor in more and more of a reality where one person or a small group can get their hands on devastating technology to destroy, you know, something impossibly huge. So that's the bigger question. I think aggression is always going to be around. And when you say, you know, I wonder how those people are made, I don't know that it's going to be done by that one. Crazy because one crazy can't get his hands on massive amounts of weaponry. He's usually one guy and he carries a gun and he does enough damage. Well, how about these kids in the Boston bombings?

Speaker 2:          00:07:35       I mean, they were fairly clean skinned. They were and they didn't. Do they, they killed, I think six people. I can remember what the thing is, but that's always tragic. What I'm saying is that the, the bigger threat is less aggression and more sort of warped ideology then moves and motivates a large group of people into aggression. Right. That that's what I worry about and that's where I think, you know, when you say aggression, you don't mean aggression, like hostile takeover of countries type of aggression. You mean just like male behavior? Like what do you mean when you say aggression? Aggression in this context is a military sense. Something that causes massive destruction, irreparable harm to infrastructure and two populations and for example, what's going on in Iraq with them, like with Isis, right? When you hear the news, if you just listen to the news, Isis is this terrible group of fanatics.

Speaker 2:          00:08:30       Yes they are and they kill lots of people. It's a much deeper problem. You know, they're talking about what do you do about isis? Well, do you bomb the shit out of him? Problem is they're, they're ingrained in the Sunni towns and population and they have a lot of support by the Sunni's. Why? Why do these fanatical guys have support from the Sunni population? Has nothing to do with whether those Sunni people who are good people, like you just said, most people are really good people. They are. They are giving support to a fanatical group of people because they are their best hedge and their best bet against what's called Shia aggression in their eyes. So the Shia, the Shia who dominate the south of Iraq, who sit on most of the oil down there. If the Sunni's don't cut out a little place for themselves using this crazy group called Isis, they could be left in there in the future, in real fucking trouble.

Speaker 2:          00:09:20       And so again, now we're talking about they're using aggression as a form in their eyes as a form of self defense. If you are a Sunni Iraq, you'd have a very different idea and context of what's, what Isis is as as opposed to uni who get our information. And again, there's nothing to admire about those guys. They are ruthless killers, but it's just interesting that you and I look at that as aggression on a ones. You know, one side is a lot of those people using ice as his health defense. Aggression is justified. Yeah, they're terrible. But we need them against the Shia. So it's hard for someone who lives in California in 2015 to wrap their head around what's going on in other parts of the world right now, unless you. I mean even what I've seen of it, I haven't seen enough. My, my, my seeing of it as all two dimensional.

Speaker 2:          00:10:09       No, I couldn't imagine I couldn't fucking mansion. It's one of the biggest problems we were going to have with people that have seen it and don't have to imagine it anymore. Trying to forget it. Trying to be normal again. When you ask a fucking hell of a lot of people and, and how do you help them through that and what kind of counseling? Mental health counseling. I hope it's comprehensive. It's a really good question because they always say after a war and after the revolution and after whatever happens in a country settles, everybody always forgets about the victims. There's never really any kind of infrastructure to help people in Sierra Leone that got their arms hacked off. That's the other kids killed in front of them and stuff like that. Is it possible that because of the ability that we have right now translate languages so quickly, you know, it just really unprecedented something that people don't think about that much, but there's all sorts of software now just on a regular phone that can look at images and translate them into English on your screen.

Speaker 2:          00:11:07       The you could have asked questions and have those questions immediately translated into Spanish. There's all these programs they have now like it's way easier to understand under other languages than it ever has been before. To decipher actual texts in real time that really never existed before and that kind of technology is going to slowly but surely break down a lot of barriers and a lot of ideas that we have about each other. Well, let's. So language and I think more so the fact that we can not only see suffering and realtime with cameras and the Internet, but we can also. We are also starting to see the cultures, whether they're Indian or South Korea are really similar to Americans, you know, with, with, with K pop. I mean Korea has got all their k pop and stuff. More importantly, when you see their artistic expressions, they're making movie slumdog millionaire.

Speaker 2:          00:11:59       You see an Indian kid who has the same dreams and aspirations as anybody does. I think that goes a longer way in bringing people into sort of a collective notion and it already has people like Steven pinker would argue that that it's becoming easier to identify with other people's suffering because we identify with a lot of aspects of how they live their lives to begin with. It's no longer like who are those strange people with dark skin nowadays. You know, people are dressing the same no matter where you go, you know, and I kind of recognized on the plane from a woman from Bombay, from Mumbai because she watches how I met your mother and telling me all her friends love how I met your mother and she was flipping out that the guy from how I met your mother was sitting next to her and she had a heavy accent.

Speaker 2:          00:12:49       She was talking like I couldn't. I can't believe I'm watching all my friends. I could. I take a big step. She was so excited and she had this heavy Indian accent and I thought that is, that never would have happened. No, you never would have happened. And so we are sharing artistic experience was sharing experience in high relief usually in movies and TV. And that's in a lot of ways that's going to go a lot farther than being able to download a language because I think that's always going to take more time. Well, if we all just spoke the same language, it will be really fucking boring. That's true. But it would be really cool if we understood what the fuck everybody was saying all the time. You know, I think it would smooth out a lot of shit between people. I really got to think that like if we could have like real time conversations with like Kim Jong, uhm, you know, if you could have a real time conversation with that dude and sit down and go, what is your life like?

Speaker 2:          00:13:46       Like explained to me like what was, what was childhood like for you? What's the environment around you all the time. He's a real, he's a real life king and he's like, he's a monarch. One of the few remaining is not that he lives like a king and it was raised like a prince and Dennis Rodman's, his homeboy that problems, a great, great spokesman for him, wasn't he? Dennis Rodman comes down things with that dude and plays basketball and shit and then leaves like what kind of fucking bizarro reality TV world are we living in, or Dennis Rodman just hops on private jets and hangs out with the king of North Korea. Be the greatest reality show I ever made. I mean him and Kim Jong Un, me and me and me and the Canada. It's like rocky Marciano hanging you and Mussolini. What do they talk about? What do they talk about?

Speaker 2:          00:14:34       Look at them. They're together. Having a good old time. Do you think he's freaked out at all about the middle amount of metal that's in Rodman's face? I know. Freaks them out. God, look at that. That is such a strange thing. Yeah. Look at him. He's a king. I mean, didn't he have his own uncle eaten wild dogs or something? Why? Yeah. Oh, that's right. Yeah. He assassinated him. That says, I was thinking about a Rodman. Rodman did that had his uncle killed. His uncle apparently was trying to organize a coup, so he killed, I believe he killed everyone in the family. Everyone in the family except the wife, and he gave the wife like a raise really promoted her to a better position. Real true. Killed her husband. Yeah. Interesting. You know, something along those lines. I'm going to be making that up. It's real game of thrones shit.

Speaker 2:          00:15:28       Yeah, it is. I mean, he really did kill his uncle and then his uncle's sons, so his uncle's sons couldn't take revenge on him. Yeah. The Russians were good at that. She used to do that and Stalin, you get rid of. Everybody needs to do that. So I'm saying, who was it? It was talking about that. I was at helmet shoulder. One of the ex German premiers went to meet. He said, I want it. Whereas the, I want to say hi to the ambassador, these different D German ambassador who I've known for 10 years, and they said he was. He was, unfortunately, he was, he was executed for, um, for treason and he was like, he'd known him for a long time and it was really kind of taken aback and I was like, oh, that's, that really makes me upset. And he goes, well, can I see the family?

Speaker 2:          00:16:10       I got to know the family, I'd like to give them my condolences to the family is no longer around either. And uh, he told that story. I think it was on that. Oh, Charlie rose or something where. Oh, they killed his whole family. That's real. I mean. And, and again, like you were saying, we have no idea what it's like. We're so lucky. We're so lucky we can walk away from things we don't like because most of the world has to live with something they don't like. Concluding a government that tells them what to do and tells them where to live until some where they're going. I don't know if this is propaganda or not. I don't know if it's bullshit or not, but I'm just telling you what I read, that they were putting people in jail if they didn't cry hard enough. When Kim Jong Il died, they.

Speaker 2:          00:16:54       Some of them were getting six months of hard labor from what? I'm not crying hard because they were not grieving hard enough. So you see these pictures that I'm beating their chest and crying party members crying for know nobody wanted to be. The first person has stopped crying, so they're crying for hours. Oh my God. This is madness. That's like group madness. Whether that's what North Korea is. Group madness. Yeah. It's like you're watching what happens when you allow these really ancient, horrific methods of dictatorship and they do even worse. Hey, if you really fucked up, they'll put you in the coal mines and you never leave. You never come out of the coal mine so you don't get any sunlight, so your skin starts to fall off, but you don't leave. You're not getting up. You're, you're living in the coal mine. Oh my God.

Speaker 2:          00:17:45       It's so bad for not crying. Thousands of North Koreans face labor can't response in Labor yet. Oh my God. Upset enough about the death of Kim Jong Il. That is insane. It's amazing. Like I guess that's the only way to run a cultural. Like if you're going to run it that way as a dictator, you have to have everybody absolutely terrified all the time. So no one takes a chance. Wow. How can you maintain that? Uh, fuck. Are they maintaining that? If your family might get put in jail or kill you, you'll do it. I know, but I mean, it's amazing. I mean, it has to be at like a boiling point. Could you imagine? Look at that. These poor people, even the kids, they move you and they move. They move. You like your designated. Where do you live in North Korea? The neighborhood you live in, if your family was against or for the original founder of North Korea, Kim Jong, UN's father, if he was, if they were in opposition to him, you live in a very shitty neighborhood. If they were allowed to have your three generations later, you live in a good neighborhood. Oh my gosh. Yeah, that's crazy. Good stuff. They're nice guy. He apparently was mad during the famine and the nineties that people were eating. The dogs were eating Korean dogs. He's like, there are national, you know, the, the agenda has like one of our national treasures and these people are eating the dogs. He was all irritated. It's a good guy.

Speaker 2:          00:19:14       Yeah. That's the worst country in the world and it's always read into that that way. It's just so crazy to think that someone's able to pull that off in this day and age. Well, he's got nuclear weapons. Thank you. Pakistan. It's just, uh, I just have a hard time believing that that can be maintained. But yet here it is. It the fact that it's still here in 2015. It's pretty nuts. This is like really late in the terms of civilization to have a full on dictator like that where we look, look at those pills. People crying again. Could you imagine any sort of a scene like that in America? If a guy died who was the king? Can look at that, look at all that. So these poor people are just faking crying. Everybody's terrified to not. They all have handkerchiefs to stop crying too soon. God. Oh my God.

Speaker 2:          00:20:09       It is. It's it's madness. It's probably what a lot of history was about when you had a king and he was absolute ruler and if he was a sociopath. Luckily if you. If you're lucky, you got a good king. Somebody who wasn't crazy, God damn dude. That is the nuttiest shit of all nutty shit. The fact that there's a still a country of millions of people that live like that. Yeah, I know God damn. That's terrifying. And whenever people talk about privilege, white privilege, black privilege, whatever kind of privilege you might have, heterosexual privilege. Here's the biggest privilege not having to live like those folks. Exactly. That's number

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       one. Above all else that isn't that, isn't that the reason? One of the big reasons to at least read the newspaper or a little history or know what's going on in the world. Have some perspective anyway. You can get it. Yeah. You know? Yeah. That mean that the term white privilege, like people don't like that term. People get mad, which usually means there's some validity to it, but everybody's. Everybody says like white privilege and you see a white dude role in his eyes. You might have a little racist. Anybody? I might have a weird conversation with you and have to go, wait, what? No. Is Not a Muslim. No, no, no, no. I had a conversation with a friend like that. He's in the middle of the conversation goes, I'm on Obama's biggest Muslim in the country. I go, no, he's not. What are you talking about?

Speaker 1:          00:21:32       Why you saying Shit like that? Man? There's no evidence that he's a Muslim at all. No, none. Zero. By the way, his dad was a Kenyan and Muslim, but he didn't know his dad very well. He grew up in Hawaii, right, but the two is not living like some secret life where he's ready to blow up America from the inside that says these dumb ass thing, callus on the middle of his head where he prays every day, which is to really get. You're supposed to that if you're very pious in Islam, you get a. You get a dark darker. The skin in that area where you touch your head to the floor is darker than the rest of your skin. That's when you know somebody really, really religious. So it's like the cauliflower ear of the Islam world. Wow. It's a badge of courage, right? What happens if you're a pussy and want like a little little pillow, a little soft pillow or they get mad at John.

Speaker 1:          00:22:14       Don't the orthodox Jews were something like that when they pray. Um, I don't know. I do not know what their practices. Well, but they want to get showing these guys with dark spots on their forehead. Oh my God. Well, I just pulled up all these photos of these guys, these super dark spots in there for. That's when you know that you got to just, just know that he's very religious. He'll be that old dude with the glasses down there. He's got like a hole in his head. Well that is. Yes. A scroll down a little bit. Some of bin Laden's righthand man, that guy, he's got his head. It was our hearing. That's the Egyptian Dr who is a Osama bin Laden's right hand man. And he's still at large and you make that photo larger. Is that possible? Fill at large by Jesus Christ. Access forbidden. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:23:02       He's a doctor to Jesus Christ. Look at his forehead, dude. That that. Man. I never heard of this before. This is insane. Brian, can you teach me something new? Every time we talk. Smart Bitch. Come on. Look at that forehead, man. That's crazy. That dude has worn a hole in his head that's like, it looks. I mean it's hard to tell because it's fairly low resolution, but whatever. That is not a good guy by the way. He's, he's. He, he and assignment were good buddies. He's still alive. He's still out there. They don't know where he is. Whoa. Egyptian doctor. That's what we're using. Very religious and very violent. We live in a movie. We really do. We really live in a movie. We live in a

Speaker 2:          00:23:45       movie and it's a weird one. You mean? You mean just the fact that we're Americans are in general. The whole world is theater and it really is. I mean, obviously it's real, but what I'm saying is the way it's playing out, it's so goofy. It seems like a work of fiction. The North Korea thing seems like a work of fiction. The Uber pious gentleman dressed like a genie who's worn a hole in his head from praying. That guy is a character in a fucking movie. Oh, and by the way, they can't find them phase out there and make is out there. He's a doctor. He's evil. He's probably got millions of dollars and they can't find. Yeah. When his Batman coming in were his Batman is. It's true. Right? It's also weird, like people have plans and they pull them off, like they just get together and go, listen, you guys were gonna hijack planes and fly them into buildings.

Speaker 2:          00:24:38       You know, people do Bengazi. Yeah. Anyway, I mean there's a bunch of different things, bitch, bit different events that have happened all over the world where people kept their mouth shut, plotted them and executed them. Dan Carlin and says this beautifully, he talks about, we always talk about they live in the age of terrorism. He said, well, the lineage Tara, Tara was actually since 1914, and he tells me a fascinating story. If you don't know the origins of World War One, it's very important because the world war one and World War Two, our connected World War Two is the continuation of World War One and about 80 or 90 million people lost their lives because of those two wars. And Oh, and it destroyed all of old Europe. Oh. And it changed the entire map of the world. Oh. And all of us live in its wake in a much deeper and more turbulent way. Then you can imagine, uh, uh, that in fact, let me keep going.

Speaker 2:          00:25:26       If you want to know about the Middle East, really, you got to study World War II. If you don't, you know, historian will take you seriously. And Dan Carlin says something fascinating. I don't know if you know the story said it did. World War One and the world you live in was changed by one man and his name was carvello princess. And he was a Serbian terrorist. And he found out that the archduke ferdinand of the ostrow, Hungarian Empire doesn't matter, was coming to town and they had control of Serbia and Serbia was looking for their independence. So they said, we're going to kill this guy. And he was in an open car with his wife and he was in a parade and one of the Serbian terrorists came running out with a grenade or a bomb through it at the car and it went it. It had a faulty thing and it blew up under the other car.

Speaker 2:          00:26:10       And six out of six people were very badly injured. I think one person was killed. But guess what? Our stoop, Ferdinand, he survives. He goes, he makes a full account. They apologize to him. And it remember, this was in Serbia, it was in Syria. I Sara Aviel, which was a sort of a colony, if you will, of the Servo Hungarian, of the Austrian Hungarian Empire. Here was the next in line for the, the in charge of the Austrian Hungarian Empire. Now check this out. This crazy. That's another story. I've sat and listened to the podcast. Maybe go ahead and keep saying it if you want. So it's just awesome. Because so, so now they say, well, we missed our assassination attempt. This Guy Carvello Prinsep who was part of this whole group, goes in for a sandwich and as the arts duke for advanced and let's get you out of here.

Speaker 2:          00:26:55       Says, no, I want to go to the hospital and I want to check on all the survivors of this bombing. They said, okay. So they go down a road and the guy misses his turn and he misses his turn and now he decides to back up and as he's backing up the car stalls and they got to kind of figure it out. And as the car stalls, because he missed a turn, a guy named Carvello Prinsep, part of this Serbian thing comes walking out with a sandwich and he goes, oh fuck. There's the archduke Ferdinand. He just right in front of me. And he shoots him and he shoots his wife. And that was because the driver missed a turn and was backing up. And carvello by coincidence, just sees the archduke and shoots him and that pin as Dan Collins has that created the hand grenade that was World War One and World War Two was because a driver missed a turn and because one terrorist, 1:20 year old guy had a gun in his hand and said, that guy's a bad guy and shot him.

Speaker 2:          00:27:48       And our world has changed forever because of that strange missed turn. That's part of what's fascinating about history. That's an amazing podcast. Which one is the. It's called the name, it's called. Yes. It's called countdown to Armageddon. Yes. And it is awesome and I'm glad we got a chance to blueprint for getting blueprint farmer. Good. I'm so glad I had a chance to drive in a car with you. We had a long trip and we could listen to Dan Carlin's, the Mongoltauge. You opened a whole can of worms for me. I've been telling you how crazy that was. Like forever. I'm like, you just got to listen to this podcast. When people say that to me though, it's hard to take them seriously while I just got to listen to another podcast, but if you listened to wrath of the cons, you will be a changed human being, 100 percent.

Speaker 2:          00:28:31       You will understand what it was like to live in that time as best as anybody could ever describe it in a way that is so ultimately paralyzingly, terrifying, 900 years old or whatever the fuck it is. You mean because you're in your. You're huddled in your church with your family and they're at the direct, the gates in there. They're bashing your gates down. You know they're going to come in and kill everybody. That was like, what? Eight hundred years ago, 700 years ago, Jesus fucking Christ. We're going to get your head cut off. You're going to die by by stabbing or cutting. It's going to suck, and they were launching bodies. They would light bodies on fire and launched them with catapults and that human fat burns better. Apparently when you really light it on fire, it can catch things on fire better. They were so fucking ruthless.

Speaker 2:          00:29:19       While I was thinking about how they live, like you know, you and I, we'd go hunting, so we live outside and for four days or three days sometimes and it's miserable and we wake up and we're freezing and we're wet and we're like, this pillows can wait to get back to civilization, but we do it because we love it. It brings us a close to objective reality where like I feel a little tougher, a little more manly, you know, the Mongols I was thinking about how they, I was kind of trying to picture it there on a horse by the time they're three. They live in the. Yeah. To stop and think about that. Yeah. Let's just start there. Three, throw the kid on a horse and I have a four year old. She's not running any fucking horse. Looks no fuck. Especially wild horse in the tar tars.

Speaker 2:          00:29:56       Fairly broken and these still have like 20 of them per Pi Whistle. They'd be like, no idea their horses show up. I, no, I never had heard that. I didn't know how the. That was one of the most terrifying things is like how well organized they were. Well, because that's how they would hunt, so they would hunt on horseback. They were such trick riders. Have you been on a horse since you were three? You can do anything on a horse, right? You can shoot an Arrow on her horse. You're just much faster, but he was. What was the were the clinical reality came in? I thought to myself, their lives were so violent to begin with. First of all, they lived. The staple was mayor milk and blood from their horse, which they would mix. They had mixed the milk and the blood and they would drink it and I wonder what that does to chemically what that tastes good.

Speaker 2:          00:30:38       Probably knocking Christ. How many parasites did they have in their body? By the time they were like 10 years, God knows or none, and they would chase because they would ferment the milk and they would. They would. The way they would hunt animals, if they would do the same with humans, they would. They would sort of push them all into one area. Then create an opening for them to run through and then they'd been waiting with a party there. They were so just daily existence was so physical and violent and they had ultimate disdain for people that live behind walls. They lived in felt tense and that was like their whole thing. It's like the actual description of what they were calling Genghis Khan, something about ruler of all who dwell in the tents. It's nothing crazy that they would show up in town and they would say, look, I guess you guys weren't aware that you owe gingiss con money.

Speaker 2:          00:31:28       Yeah. So or jingles. They like to say genius. It was gang is when John Wayne did it. I grew up with gangs. I swear to got to go hang with Dan Carlin. I was like, dude, this holiday Gangas Ching is gone. His real name is [inaudible], but Dan Carlin, what he does so good is make it utterly fascinating. He's such an expert narrator storyteller. He's an expert. I mean like a real master at it. So when he's telling you these stories, it's not just. It's not just really cool information, which most absolutely is, but it's the ways written it all and put it together and worded it. It's just fucking. He lives in Portland. Don't give him his fucking address with the Mongols. Come here. Right. Shit, man. I'm just going to be important that a little bit. I want to try to him man, getting. We're Dan, if you're listening to this, come to my show in Portland. He's a great guy. You'll love tweeting with them. Super Cool Guy. Real fun. I've had him on the podcast a few times. Yeah, I'd love to meet. He's doing a goddamn national service with that 100 percent of world's service, I should say. I shouldn't say interpersonal. It's on the Internet. Could not agree more. It's so much more entertaining than any other history thing I've ever witnessed and watched.

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       Listened to. I mean I've spent enough time over the past 20 years at least listening to different kinds of like the turning points in European history and you know from the teaching company, really good professors and nothing compares to that guy. Nothing. Well, there's so many good podcasts right now. It's just like there's a, you know, I was talking with someone yesterday about how many good tv shows there are today as opposed to like when we were kids, like we were kids. Like what was a really good show on TV? I Mash, I guess mash was a really good. What was it like a really good drama was running. Oh, Hill street blues. Hill street blues was great, but that's the only one I can think of off the hill street blues is later. That was like, wasn't that. It was 85. What does it really?

Speaker 1:          00:33:23       Actually it was 80, 81. Why do I have that all fucked up in my head? Oh, I think I haven't fucked up with NYP ed blue. That's what it is. Yeah. That's what it is. What else? What's that? A good drama. I can't think of a good drama right now. Compare that to what's available today. Compare that to game of thrones. Walking dead mad men breaking bad. Better. Call Saul. Yeah. House of cards. Homeland. Jesus Christ. It's not. I can't even keep up. Salt of wizard shows they're so goddamn good and you got to be good because they have those hbo shows. Now, those hbo shows took everything to a totally different level. When they put out the soprano's, the whole game changed. All of a sudden you're like, Jesus, this is better than a movie. This is a movie that's forever because they made a character.

Speaker 1:          00:34:12       It used to be. The rule was that character has to be somebody you like, who you want to bring in your living room every week. That was the rule and when you went to pitch a show and your character wasn't quote unquote likable, people were like, Nah, it's not going to work. Along comes Tony Soprano, huge adulterer, murderer, kill his friend, his friend and tells his son to do his homework. In the same breath, talk about a dichotomy and and of course as human beings, we're like, well, that's real life. That's how I feel sometimes. He was the courageous mob character in the history of mob characters over the top, down the hill, through the valley, up the mountain, through the ocean. Everyone else can suck his dick. All of them, they all can suck his dead. We were talking about the greatest of all time.

Speaker 1:          00:35:01       I think me and shop and a couple other people were talking about the best overall character on TV ever. Yeah, I think it's got to be Tony Soprano. I vet or Walter White. The felons or why? It's a good bet. Yeah, I was. I was torn between the two and I think I ultimately went with Walter, but I might say now because of peer pressure. Tony Soprano. Yeah. You know, there's, there's been some goddamn good ones. There's like, but that his character had. We had so much time to get to know him. Yeah. You know, and that's just so different was that it was, wasn't like television style, like show making.

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       It was movie making, but it was a new thing because it was really complex and you could do it over a long time. You could have a season and you're going, you know, you're telling a story over months and months and you're getting people addicted. It's a completely different experience. And you realized like at a certain level, like they, that show changed everything. That changed everything. It was just so next level. It was. I never gave a fuck about mob shows. Yeah, it was one before that. In a way. It wasn't even a mach show in a way. It was a guy running two families, a crime family and his own family. That was. That was the idea. So you were looking at a human being and what I think they did an amazing job was as evil as he was, they were putting them in impossible situations.

Speaker 3:          00:36:25       You couldn't run that fucking crime family without being a complete motherfucker. Yet he had to run his own family, make marriage work. That's it. I didn't know a lot of people identified with the impossible life is that way. Yeah. It's an extreme example, but you know, it's, it is really. It's like we could almost, if you were born that guy and that guy's family and that guy's life and that guy's neighborhood with that guys experiences, you would be in the exact same situation as he is right now at chain of events. From the time you were shot out of your mother's, Vijay, Jj has led you to where you're at. It's just like looking at those North Korean people. Man, should they pull themselves up by their bootstraps? Like what should they do to anyone to say, hey, hey, you know what? Hey, where everybody's got to hug.

Speaker 3:          00:37:09       My friend Mike, he was born in Africa, but he said I want to be American. So he got in the car. He drove to the airport, you know, you know those guys. If they wanted to, they could do it. Like, do you know what the fuck you said? You anecdotal asshole. He told one shitty story about some supposed friend that probably doesn't even exist. It was born in the step. I remember the argument with them. It's like if you make. If you make the sanction strong enough, his people will get so miserable that Delta overthrow the go. You try overthrown that guy when he kills your whole family. Yeah. They're the ruthlessness that these people operate under. Like if you live in American, you haven't experienced war and you start talking about stuff like that. Like start talking crazy, but do you remember there was a time during the debates that John Mccain, I think, I think anytime you've got Sarah Pailin as your fucking running mate, you're hamstrung, right?

Speaker 3:          00:38:00       I mean you're basically over because no one, no one rational is going to say yes to that. Like you've got someone have really clearly marginal marginable intelligence. Yeah. It's a very marginal right. If you look at the way she communicates, she's. She's obviously not very bright. She's certainly very myopic in her experience and her perspective. She's got that down home, folksy thing going on, but it's. It seems, which is very poorly thought out. Like there are people that are down home and folks when you talk to them their way of communicating, you can. You can, you can still get through that to that like, well, this

Speaker 1:          00:38:35       is an intelligent nuanced person with a lot of depth to what they're saying. This is just the way they they talk to maybe from Wisconsin. Maybe it's like Doug Durant, our friend Doug. Yeah. From Wisconsin. Very, very smart guy and brilliant. Yeah. Brilliant guy. If you underestimate him because he's a farmer in Wisconsin, we'd be in for a surprise. Yeah, exactly. Like the idea that some someone has to fit into any particular style of communication just to Napa and we were talking about what was the wine, it was canvas, which is a high end wine, like $200 a bottle and she was saying that the guy who makes the wine, I mean when you buy a winery and a restaurant, please be ready to spend if it's special, select 325 bucks and you'd think this is a genius winemaker, and she was like, he's a farmer at parties, piece of farmer.

Speaker 1:          00:39:25       He grows good grapes and then kind of does the thing that he was told, but at the end of the day, Wagner is a farmer and and you had underestimated him. You saw him in his overalls and you'd be like, well that guy's one of the best winemakers in the world. Will those folks that we were talking to up in Napa, the Rainelle is friends. Friends. Yeah. They were all farmers are grape farmers. The noises people. They were. How about that was so cool. The food was delicious. As soon as I saw that guy and I saw that he was cooking, tried tips. I'm like, this motherfucker. I guarantee you could cook the shit out of a tri tip. However you said old California dudes, old rancher, California. Do they know how to cook those tri tips? Because it tried. Tip is a very peculiar type of meat.

Speaker 1:          00:40:04       It's very lean. You can't overcook it. You got to cook it the right amount. It's not a lot of fat on it, but if you know how to nail it and for whatever reason, California ranchers, dude, special ed, they had like a special grill for it. I think it's called Santa Maria Grill and it cranks and as you're cranking, you're like raise or lower it above, above the heat and you want to make it you. It's like you have to. This is back. They learned how to do this shit before they have thermometers was just how the fork would go into it. They could figure out like how done it was just by how the fork felt, how it slid into it. So I saw that dude and I saw he was cooking tips. I'm like, Oh, where we were eating here dude, because we were thinking about going to a restaurant.

Speaker 1:          00:40:40       I was like, restaurants in the world. We actually forego or went down because it was so god damn boy, that guy was cool as fuck. And we started talking to him. Damn it. Do you remember his name? And now I want to say Mike, I know his son is a model for rick or Mike. His son who was a nice guy was there is a model, I forgot to give him shit for it. But if someone's a model for a romance novel Vampire Romance on a lot of vampire was ah, you know, you've made it when you're a model for vampire romance novels. And I forgot his name too, but he was cool. Very friendly guy, but he's just some guy. I interrupted you with my, my tangential story about that because you reminded me of it and you were, you were making a larger point. What was I saying?

Speaker 1:          00:41:19       Fuck me. Whatever it was, it couldn't be that unfortunately. Exactly. Keep it rolling. Keep it rolling here. I don't even remember at all. Hey Man. We went. We went Turkey hunting. You guys look at this quote from the Denver police, the Denver police. They put out a tweet. I'm. No, that's not what it was, Jamie. There was one. It was more hilarious. Scroll down a little bit. It was the four slash 20 tweet. Does it like there is. No. They had like a, like Roland, Roland, Roland put it. It's on my twitter. Dude. Just go to my twitter and you'll find it, but it's. It's actually kind of hilarious. I retweeted it. I think it's a good patient. I their there. Fuck, look at that in Denver said, I said even the police or high end for 20. Look at this. This is the police.

Speaker 1:          00:42:04       We see you Roland, but we ain't hate and ha ha. Seriously though. Hashtag Denver. Please remember to Hashtag consume responsibly this for 20 weekend. Good fats and the police department, like the police department in Denver, they have little music things there. What are those? Emojis? A little music kimojis for them. Good for them. I love it was not the nicest police department of all time. They might be. See, ladies and gentlemen, this is what happens when you let a state gets stoned. This is what happens. This is exactly what I've been telling you forever and it's an action right now. This is the police are nicer first cylinder and nobody was getting cavities. Now it's we'd. Where'd it go? Colorado is Colorado. Is Florida in the water. Good Dude. Is that, is that real? Well, that's what I think in the fifties, what they found with certain communities in Colorado that we're not getting cavities thing.

Speaker 1:          00:42:54       It's in Colorado and they couldn't figure out why. Why aren't the kids getting cavities? And they found there's a high level of Florida and the water naturally. Yeah. Yeah. That does happen, right? Like if you have a. there's some waters that have higher levels of fluoride, like natural fluoride. Yeah. And apparently there's. That's one of the things it's supposed to be not good. When you drink distilled water, they say don't know because you want all those minerals and all that other jazz. It's in water. Very much so. I think, and I believe you used distilled water on a plant, a lot of times the plant dies. That's what I was told from a farmer, but some people think that fluoride ultimately is not good for your body. Is there any science that goes with that? Because people love to quote. They always say this one thing, hey man, calcifies your pineal gland, and I'm like, have you done any lab biopsies?

Speaker 1:          00:43:39       If we have a pretty good big control group, like, like the entire population of the United States over the past 50 years, I don't see a lot of people with calcified pineal gland, pineal gland. I don't know if that's even a real thing for Sarah. I don't know. Is it possible guy isn't the pineal gland? Yeah, that's what they're saying is that it always feels a little stiff. I can't see out of it. I'll tell you that much. And then there's this other one that they say that maybe snopes this Jamie. They said you do that fluoride in the water was pioneered by the Nazis for mind control, Dude. Well get you knew that man. So with think about that. Think about that man. I drink green water wilting in that because you haven't thought about it. Big Dude. You don't even know fucking I'm online. It was the last time you read about, besides twilight decides to Info wars manual of life infowars.com book.

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       Besides twilight. If you're a guy and you're reading twilight number clauses, I come out of the closet. You can be like what you like. It's all right. Like what you'd like man, I was at the Chateau Marmont and that guy sat and sat at the table with me and my buddy Frank Grillo or at the guy the main vampire that throw the fucking guy from twilight. Robert Pattinson. Yes. And he sat at my table and I stared at him. I didn't say hi. He was very nice and he got up and it's like nice to meet everybody and I was like, see you later. That's my story about him. That's an amazing story. Thank you buddy. Dude, you should. You should write that down. I met him. Um, there's a guy named John Stewart that I used to work with a on fear factor. The greatest hilarious dude, just a guy who had been in show business forever and he was a straight total pro.

Speaker 1:          00:45:26       All Right Ladies and gentlemen, it can't get any better than. This is just one of those guys. He would move the contestants through. Everybody was smiling when they talked to them. Just one of those motherfuckers. He's Kristen Stewart's dad. Oh Wow. Makes Sense. Of course she was raised by a wild man. He's a cool motherfucker. He's the coolest long hair, scraggly hair. His daughter's school dude, man has been around forever. Just a super sweet guy. I grew up around sets acting. Yeah, probably, but back then like she did a couple movies and I was like, dude, why are you letting your daughter do that? Isn't it freak you out? And she's like, can I get famous at a young age? And she wasn't worried about it and then obviously she became this giant fucking movie store. So I'm like, dude, lucky he didn't listen to me.

Speaker 1:          00:46:11       Yeah, get her out of Alistair. I was telling you to pull your daughter selling insurance right now, the gigantic fucking movie star. So don't listen to me ever, or how about that if I give you advice, but who knows, man, truth about fluoride doesn't include the Nazi myth. Okay. So the Nazis a minute. If history shows, I actually didn't Nazi Germany and one of the first things they did was add fluoride to the water and the ghettos were the Jews stayed. Matt Leffler of Cleveland told the county commissioner Tuesday before. Well, what does it say here? Well, if he's saying, okay, what is this is not saying whether it's real or not real or who knows. It's just a story on it. We should figure out like what is the actual truth? Where's the story come from? Here it goes. What is the story? Cause no teeth to this claim.

Speaker 1:          00:46:56       Yeah. I can almost guarantee you that it is indeed in the urban myth said, and the whole injury. Who handles the media relations with the US Holocaust memorial museum. Well, okay. Hmm. Okay. It seems like it's not real done right. Or could be. Wasn't about Nazis, Florida in water. It was communist, but okay. So it seems like more than likely it was an urban myth. Well, now what about, this is the thing, Jamie Google this fluoride calcifies the pineal gland, because I just want to get to the bottom of this. Get to the bottom of this. Studies have been done on the pineal gland. What happens if, what's floor? I do it in there. When are they going to clone hair? That's what I want to know. Ladies and gentlemen, you can get hairier fluoride, deposition age, human pineal gland. Ooh. So is it saying to pot?

Speaker 1:          00:47:52       The purpose was discover. That purpose was to discover whether fluoride accumulates in the aged human pineal gland. The aims were to determine a f concentrations of the pineal gland, wet, whatever that means. Corresponding muscle, wet and bone ash be counseling. Calcium, concentration of the pineal, pineal, muscle and bone were dissected from 11 aged cadavers. Okay. What does it say to or too much reading? I'll take A. I'll take a calcium pineal gland then hold her teeth. My teeth suck. Here it goes right here. Fluoride does not accumulate in the brain who. Wait a minute. Okay, so it's not, so you would really do that though. You would take of calcium and your pineal gland. It means saying it's not real, but what if it was real? Yeah. You knew t. that's right. Well, I don't want holes in my teeth. Go with dentists. Dentists, pineal gland.

Speaker 1:          00:48:49       I do makes Melatonin Shit. They believe now that it makes dimethyltryptamine that really heavy duty psychedelic. They uh, it makes a bunch of different things. Shit, take Melatonin pills and have good teeth. You know what it looks like. The weird thing about the pineal gland, have you ever seen the look, look up a Egyptian image, pineal gland. The actual like side, um, view of the pineal gland. I didn't even know it was actually a real. I always thought it was like the third item is, yeah, it's a real. That's what's really fucked up. Look what it looks like. It looks like that thing a lot, that Egyptian solo a lot. And if you look at the actual structure of the pineal gland and that I, what does that, I suppose to represent? Probably someone super smart is watching you bitch too. It looks like to me, I mean it's super, super similar in appearance with the pineal gland looks like and what that thing looks like.

Speaker 1:          00:49:46       If it's dissected and cut. I'm sure that the Egyptians did their sheriff cutting brains up and being. You look at that thing nest. That's where the pineal gland is way in the side of the brain. I thought it was right to write in your forehead. No, it's like, it's like look where your eyeballs are, right? Yeah. And then it's like literally like right here and back like right where your brainstem right in there. Apparently they think that this uncertain, like lower animals like snakes I think or reptiles. That thing actually has a retina and a lens. I don't see where it says pineal gland on this thing. I think that's a backup there, Jamie. That's what the gland is and that's where it is. Let's see. You know, see where. Where does it show it? Does it have a buddy? That's the thalamus buddy was acquitted of that

Speaker 1:          00:50:41       pineal gland part one right there. See pineal gland on the right and there they are. Okay. That's what they're saying here. Neither of us know what the fucking pineal gland looks like. There is a pineal gland is looks like I said at the base. How freaky is that? I don't know. It's all this. There's just the. The knowledge that your brain is making all these weird chemicals all the time and keeping them in balance is super important and you can do it with exercise and you can do it with like having positive thinking and getting outside and the sun and it's also what is the brain? That's what sort of what really is it really is it, you know, what kind of some sort of blows my mind. Some sort of a. As it's functioning as it's all lit up, right? It's some sort of a portal to everything in the universe and that's really what the brain is and eventually that, that thing will get to a point where it's capable of communicating with anybody within any reasonable distance instantaneously.

Speaker 1:          00:51:50       So as this brain continues to get stronger, accumulate more information, accumulate more technological breakthroughs that allow it to do more things and manipulate matter more. As long as it stays alive, as long as the human organism stays alive, you've thought of it as a giant super thing. Yeah. It's something that if you're looking at the in terms of the creation of the earth, the earth is billions of years old. It took a long fucking time to go from the first version of the earth. All the rocks and the lava and the water and shit to what we have today. It takes a long ass time. Well, I think the human organism takes a long ass time to become what it really is and what it really is, is the universe figured out how to build something that can make a universe. While I was going to say that the human brand is going to get to a point where it's able to replicate itself and then improve on itself and you'll be able to download other people's brains and you'll be able to send your download to other people's brands and you'll have an experience of what it's like to be that person and there's some people that resist this because they say, look, we already right now don't know nearly enough about the biological functions of human body.

Speaker 1:          00:53:03       We already right now don't know. I absolutely understand that and I agree that they're right. I, I, you know, I'm not disputing that at all. What I am saying though is it might not even matter. They might be able to come up with technology that completely circumvents all the biological bullshit that we have to deal with as far as like processing proteins and vital nutrients and all that horseshit. We could possibly

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       bypass that one day by meshing with machines. I think it's going to happen. I really do. I know you had to. Aubrey de Grey on your podcast. I had in my mind, I'm having them on again, I had him on my show, but I'm having them on the podcast real soon. Yeah, because I was talking to him. He was talking about there are seven different, I guess a cell. There are seven different ways of self degenerates and they're working on figuring out ways to stop that degeneration. It's a mechanical issue at this point that they're. They're isolating how cell breaks down, why it does and they're going to try to figure out a way to stop it, but you know, I said nanotechnology and stuff. Wow. There's a chance that all your work could be circled circumnavigated by just that, that inexorable rise toward, you know, just kind of pushing us way beyond our biology with machines. And he was like, yeah, maybe. You know, I just,

Speaker 3:          00:54:12       I think if you look at it in terms of the long haul, well let's just assume that people are able to stay alive and not below each other up or not get hit by a meteor for the long haul. Let's give us a 100 years to have any idea how goddamn crazy technology is going to be in a hundred years. So anybody looks at it's pooling is we don't have the capabilities. Don't you think that that's what they said back when they lived in caves? How would we got to block that hole? We can't do it. We don't know how they had to figure out how to make a fucking door. Okay, so when you had to figure out how to make a door to a cave, somebody had to figure out fire. Somebody had to figure out stone tools and then we learned from them. It all keep steam rolling and apparently the brain is evolving as well.

Speaker 3:          00:54:58       The brain is evolving in the way that it interfaces with computers. The way we process information, it's all directly with our way of the allocation of resources mentally is very different now than it was before. You could just ask Google a question is this is some weird. Shit's going to happen to the brain itself. If we start adding things to it, if we start putting in little transmitters or little things, little little way, ways to wireless interface with each other, you know, you and I've talked about this, that experiment that they did where they sent a word, they sent a couple of words from one person to the other person through the Internet and they received the word. They were blindfolded. They, they, they put take all these steps to make sure that the way they're receiving it was only brain to brain. Like, dude, we're, we're getting like, these are the baby steps of some really crazy shit. If we could just stay alive. If you can stay alive for like a hundred years, the world will be unrecognizable.

Speaker 2:          00:55:57       Well, they say that's the case in 40 or 50. Ray Kurzweil says in 40 or 50 years it's going to be. He might be right. Yeah. Because it's moving so exponentially and the minute machine start replicating themselves are building better machines. Yeah. Comes with a very dark side, but also comes from a very promising sign. Just reject it. Biologist reject it. That makes a lot of them do. But a lot of them do because they think that they don't. We don't know enough about the human mind to even come close to saying that we could replicate it or download consciousness into a computer and that seems to be the truth. And what I think is it's, it's going to be the case of technology reaching a level of capability that we can't even fathom. We can't fathom it. It's. It's too far away from our little pea brains right now.

Speaker 2:          00:56:48       So there could be kind of an interface that we can't even imagine. I think that they have to, if you can imagine it, I think that human, the human imagination exists because that is a window into what is actually possible. In other words, you know, I think that if you can imagine it, it's going to be a matter of time before it actually becomes something you can measure and see with your eye, your ear, or an instrument. I think it's going to be something that you can actually touch. I think anything that like where you're talking about downloading the human brain, communicating the way we communicate with radio waves, the way we text texting each other with our brains. I don't think that's magic. I don't think it's far fetched. I think if you look at the way science seems to be developing, it's a matter of when, not if it's so weird.

Speaker 2:          00:57:34       If you think about what a human being is, if you think about like I've been watching nature documentaries lately, man had gone through this one of these weird stages while I just started watching documentaries on, you know, various animals and the just the cruelty of the environment that they live in, the cannibalism and the attacking each other and life eats life. Oh, it's fucking chaos, man. We watched this documentary on baboons. These baboons fucking each other up and you're like, Jesus Christ, trying to protect their babies in the baboons should the show should have been called dead baby babble because they showed us like 10 fucking dead baby baboons. This scientist on Ted, the Ted talk was talking about how humans are not the only animals that just kill each other because you know, because you know the animals kill out of dominance or our food and stuff, and he said, let me tell you something.

Speaker 2:          00:58:27       This baboons showed up. He studies baboons babbling shows up in this whole group and he's kind of an asshole. He's just loud. He's just not being respectful to the other males. He just running around because I kind of tried to fuck the the women without going through the necessary baboons steps you got to and he's just loud and being a pain in the ass. Well, the next morning he said, he said, he goes, I knew this bat boom was going to get it. I just didn't know how. Next morning he shows the picture. All they find is the baboon's face, the baboon's face basically torn asunder through whatever, every direction and just his perfect face going like that. Just a silent scream was left on the ground. Whoa. That's what they do. Cut His face off his face off with what? Their teeth? Yeah, they just bit his head off. They've been as head away from his face. Basically. You've got some big deals. They do. They have ferocious looking teeth, man. They're. They're like a dog fucked a monkey. Yeah, that's exactly. It's really what it's

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       like. It doesn't look like any other animal. It's such a weird dog monkey combination. Shake pet. They, if they, if the baboons was in a movie, like if they didn't exist, but they were in like Lord of the rings, it would be a terrifying animal. Like an animal that lived in the forest that was thinking about like stealing your babies. You know, they eat human babies, man. Well my soul champs too, by the way. We throw a birthday party for my, my, one of my kids and they brought a baboons. Oh No. And I was like, Oh yeah, we'll just make it a pattern. She tends. She was, she was a very submissive. She would fall to the ground and let you pick bugs from her back. That's how they show submissive submission, but nervous. She was nervous. She had big teeth and she was large.

Speaker 1:          01:00:06       That's all. Let's, let's keep about 10, 10 yards back. Fuck that. Yeah. Well that's not fair. That animals shouldn't be there. Software, the animal you're putting the animal without even understanding its language. You putting it in this incredible stressful situation where it's around kids look at the fucking teeth on that. That's a male. Oh my God. The monsters. Just monsters. Look at the teeth. It's like a werewolf. It is that what it insanely crazy looking animal. Like if that was in a movie and they always chasing after Bilbo Baggins, you would totally buy it. You'd be like, oh my God, that's a werewolf. How is that not a werewolf? I mean, look at the fucking teat on that thing. Those are stills are giant teeth, man. Those fangs are so disproportionately large. Yeah. Do the females have teeth like that? Probably. Probably. Damn. Look at that thing.

Speaker 1:          01:01:04       Jesus Christ color. Oh my God. Dude. Below that picture up. Look at the fucking face on that thing. Yeah. But look at the, uh, female genitalia and the other picture. And that's what I'm looking at. Look at that. That's just retarded. But with a face to like, this is real, like, okay, if human beings didn't exist, if we just didn't exist at all on earth, this fucking thing would be out there just like it is now if we never would never existed. Yeah. If we just. We never figured out houses. We never, we just. We died off a long fucking time ago. That thing would be out there just like that. That thing would be out there a million years from now. Just like that. Look at that fucking monster. I mean we made it to 2015 with cell phones and jet airplanes and microwave ovens and tvs and laptops and that fucking primate that came up with us.

Speaker 1:          01:02:05       This fucker didn't make it out of the neighborhood. That's what they always say is the fundamental difference between human beings and animals. Even though we're an animal, we're the only animal with potential, with the only animal that continues to evolve. We evolve within our own lives. Yeah. We, we can see in the future, you're really observant of yourself and correcting of yourself. You'll continually evolve. Yeah. You're going to be smarter and 10 generations and that baboons, they're all going to be the same way they will have. That's interesting that you said that because I want to keep hate, keep saying radiolab, but there was another podcast they did about instincts and how you could change the entire behavior of a tribe of baboons. If they got rid of this one alpha male. That was like fucking everybody up. Really? Yeah. They got rid of twitter.

Speaker 1:          01:02:51       Yeah. They got rid of one alpha male that was fucking everybody up and then something happened. I forget what the actual event was that caused them to be submissive to each other and grooming each other and then they just kind of kept up with it and then they came back years later expecting to see the same sort of violent behavior that they've witnessed before, but no, they had this. They had developed this like peaceful baboons tribe, which is. There is no. There was no threat. What was it? A way? Lesser Threat. They're still fucking baboons, but apparently the way they dealt with each other was way more relaxed like and they. That was really confusing to these biologists who observed it. It was very unexpected, I should say. Shouldn't say confusing. I mean it was a welcomed discovery. I'm sure he realizing like, wow, how much of behavior, okay.

Speaker 1:          01:03:37       Like we're talking about North Korea and we're talking about America in 2015. Look at the difference between the way that cultures are allowed to communicate and express themselves. Just by this podcast. You could see the difference between someone who lives in a crazy, crazy dictatorship that they're living in is happening in the same timeline. Yeah, it's happening right now. Well, it goes back to also when you first started this podcast about talking about most people that are great and there's a couple of assholes. It takes only a couple of assholes in charge to change the character of an entire society to and make people behave in a very crazy way. Those baboons changed when you took away the alpha. I wonder if North Koreans would be crying for three hours straight if they didn't have a fucking alpha male running their tribe. Who is that much of a fucking monster? Obviously not.

Speaker 1:          01:04:23       I wish I could remember the exact specifics of what caused them to chill out. Didn't remember too much information in my head. I'm having a real problem with that lately. I got to regulate the amount of information that's going in my head and then go over it with a fine tooth comb. I think I feel like I'm taking in all day way too much data. I feel that way too. Like I forgot. I can't really remember names and specifics. I have to start talking in general terms because I'm afraid I'll make a mistake. I'm talking really about individual stories and individual subjects of news especially because I feel like if you got online every day and start scouring the news and looking for interesting things and seeing the latest video to see the silver back gorilla that slammed into the cage at the zoo. No. Oh, ready? Tight.

Speaker 1:          01:05:10       Tighten up your belt. My favorite day. There's a little kid that starts doing some chest thumps. No. Yes she does. And the silverback ain't hearing it. Watch this. This is fucking crazy dude. So you see the little kid. You could see her in the corner. She's pounding are her hands on her chest and this why we never fixed that. The shitty video quality thing. Those little things we bought didn't fix it. Okay. Coco the gorilla with Robin Williams. We still have that really super shaky video for some reason. Yeah. Coco the gorilla. I can't believe he let that thing touch them. They're a lot less dangerous than a. They say gorillas have their own personality, so some can be really mean. It's not going to be really sweet. She was super sweet, but if she wanted to just pull your dick off stuff at through your eyeball.

Speaker 1:          01:05:56       She could anytime she wanted to. It might be a guy, isn't it? Is it? I think it's a girl. How thick. Oh Wow. So he just pulls him down to look at that. Oh my God. Can you go full screen on that or is that when screws up. Oh, good God. Well that's like an alien dude. You know? Look at that. Wow kisses his hand. Oh Shit. This is an amazing time. This is a bizarre video. I guess I wouldn't be so nervous that things really peaceful. Look at him. Wow. It took his glasses and put his glasses on. Whoa. See that's when it gets really weird. Nigo what? What do you mean? What are we dealing with here? This is like a life form that speaks a some sort of a sign language with human beings so it understands what you're saying. It just can't vocalize the noises that we wanted to in order to communicate, but man, that is a crazy animal right there.

Speaker 1:          01:06:58       If that thing didn't exist, fuck big foot. I'll just say it right now. Fuck. Big Foot and his dirty crusty ass. Big flips. Not nearly as cool as a Goddamn St. tickle me. You're going to take all the girl isn't a Nazi signs. Tickle guys want to see stronger. That thing is to me. Oh, what are you talking about? You can't even fathom it at a different level. It's not even the same. It's just not fair. It's like how much stronger you then a flower. Well, how about just Brennan? Who grabbed me around the waist the other day and he was like yesterday. I was trying to get out. First of all, I try to shoot a single leg on him. Look at that. No, keep it. Give it to look at this. This is so crazy. It's just looking at that body. Get them laughing. It's so.

Speaker 1:          01:07:39       It's nuts that each other with great pet. You're hilarious. Stupid gorilla in your house until he decides that he wants to eat your food. Right now they actually are a strict vegetarians. Which people find a shocking. Yeah, there and people are like, hey man, this is totally evidence that you can eat in all plant diet and you can be immensely massive muscular or it's evidenced that gorillas are different than people. They always say, well, both are so strong and their total vegetarians. Go eat grass and then run a mile. See how you feel. Yeah. Good luck with that. You have four stomachs. Whatever the fuck it is. Yeah. We're different men. That's a gorilla to different than a person doesn't. It needs only Broccoli. Coco checks his ID. That is hilarious. Science tickles. I went to the Santa Barbara Zoo like maybe six months ago or so, and they have gorillas there and uh, you just get right up next to him in the glass and you look in and you see them walking around and they're, you know, they're essentially just a few yards from you just right there walking around.

Speaker 1:          01:08:50       It's kind of fucked up in San Diego. Santa Barbara. Yeah. It's kind of fucked up because you really shouldn't be able to just look at a gorilla because if you just look at them in real life, they run at you, they'd make them. You ever seen that bluff charge they make that is pull a video of that terrorism. Makes Silver. Black silverback. Makes Bluff charge. Do we figure out why this is so crammed the shape? D glass after? Yeah. Here he goes. Look at this boom day. Do you have any idea how fucking strong he must be a south. And that was just because she was on her chest and then nuts, man gets charged by Ma. What does that say? Gorilla those second one down? Is that the one that. I think one of the largest silver back 500 pounds. Try that one. Bluff, charge 500 pounds silver, but we'll get the belly to belly.

Speaker 1:          01:09:45       That's parasites, Bro. Is that what that is? I don't know, but that's a crazy belly. I'm disgusted and ashamed. Do you think that gorilla cares about his gut? I don't freak them out. Is that a girl you think or a guy? Um, I think it's a guy that looked very girl, like for some reason, like maybe she was pregnant. Oh, maybe she was. Yeah. I feel like that's probably the silver back. That's probably why the silver box going to bum rush the show. That is the silver. You imagine these assholes are actually, I say assholes with all due affection and admiration, but these dudes are in the middle of the fucking jungle. Just walking around with cameras in front of wild gorillas. Not to mention there a bunch of really bad people in the Rwandan juggles. I think Joseph Kony hangs out there sometimes. Yeah. And his Hutu militia is what?

Speaker 1:          01:10:33       A freaking animal. A gorilla is super intelligent thing. It's enormous. Possibly strong. Just strong eats vegetation and is so strong, it could just rip you apart with the hands and that's how it gets by. It gets by, not by killing everything around it gets by, by being able to kill so many things that everybody just goes fuck that. That's why they nest on the ground. It's unbelievable gorillas. They could, if a gorilla wanted to pull himself up a tree, it would be pretty fucking easy. But they don't nest in trees and proud of it. I'm sure that's a great. That's a pregnant girl. Is pregnant part of it. Um, because she looks like a female looks. She's because I'm a biologist. I don't know if you know, she just looks less horrifically strong than the male is. She's more like soft and fuzzy. I didn't.

Speaker 1:          01:11:24       They find out originally they used tools. They definitely like will dig with sticks to dig, to get roots and shit. No, they're all, they all vegetation. That's what they, they're all about vegetation. I'm sure that they have probably figured out some sort of tool to do something and we just make sense man. I mean, it's not like they're building the wheel, constructing houses. I think it's still food to a bear. Look at the size of grizzly bears, size of that thing. I don't know about all that. Five hundred pounds. How much do they weigh? A lot more. A lot more, but it's a different kind of weight, is it? Yeah. I mean, no grizzly bears are ridiculous. Strong animal, but a fucking big five slash 600 pound gorilla. He might fuck a grizzly bear up. He might smack a grizzly bear and his head, grizzly bear might be stupid to tangle with this thing.

Speaker 1:          01:12:23       Hard to hurt. He looks like his head was well. The grizzly bears are impossible to her. He ever seen them fight each other. It's insane. So what's the bear going to do it? Unless he knows the Jujitsu, he's kind of. I mean the girls got to get behind them and choke them with the grill. Going to do the grills. Going to just smack them in the head. Just pound them, bite and throw them. Maybe freak the fucking bear out into thinking that this thing is way scarier though a bear. Yeah, but as far as if they went to the death, depends on how big the barriers and how big the gorillas. Oh, guess what? Those are so fucking smart though. I would think that they would figure out a way. What would you fuck a. either where they are, because they're wild too. I mean the reason why they have those giant canines, that's the fight they fight other gorillas.

Speaker 1:          01:13:09       Yeah. It's just a matter of does he have like, like a grizzly bear. You know what's interesting about the way grizzly bears kill? So we were. It was really kind of creepy. It seems that animals that kill a variety of things or animals that eat a variety of things, I should say a real omnivores which bears are real. I'm no worse. They don't necessarily kill things before they start eating them. Right. They just hold them down. I know there've been a lot of like in grizzly man, I think the guys start getting his legs eaten first. Yeah, and for like seven minutes the video goes on lens caps on what you just hearing the sound of him screaming. Oh, and her screaming and this is going on for seven fucking eating him alive in Christ and that's how they kill you. They eat you alive.

Speaker 1:          01:13:52       Fuck. That's not at all they want to do is hold you because there is so much bigger. There is so much bigger than you. So the thing has pawned my chest and he's just wilson down on my quads. Mostly your gut or your asshole, they'll. They'll go asshole first. Yeah. Apparently that's how coyotes kill the kill asshole. First. A deer like they've found deer that were locked up together. I mean it's like sometimes when deer for. I know you know this, they will. They're the men are fighting and the men their horns because they slam heads together. Sometimes they wedged their horns together in a way that they literally can't get out and there's a video of these. You find this video of these two bucks that are connected together and one of them dead because it was eaten alive by these coyotes in the coyotes ate it, asshole first.

Speaker 1:          01:14:44       So the whole back legs and the haunches and the assholes all torn out like they ate all of that and, and this other deer is still connected to him. Well then he must have been like, eat a little more please. No, it's, it's, it's like that. But the, the, it's a video and they're, the actual carcass is still attached to the other one. Like it's not like that. It looks awful. It doesn't look like a full deer. It looks like the bottom half is halfway. No, that's not it. No. I guess you start to see if you could find it. Um, I forget the exact way it was phrased in the title. Something about a hunter's rescue. Buck. One Dead, one alive. I don't know. It might be it. That's weird. It might be it so weird. It's hard to tell God that video looks like Shit.

Speaker 1:          01:15:42       It was wobbly. Okay. It's just pictures. That's why I was like, that's ridiculous video ever. Uh, that's not it. The actual one was these two. Doesn't matter. You can find it folks if you've got more time than us, but they, um, they lock horns, they get stuck in the coyotes. Just eat them, asshole first. That's how they do it. I don't want, I don't want it to turn me over and eat my, but how about you going to stare and your buddy's eyes while you're connected together by the head while he's getting his asshole eaten? You got to wear a fucking stuck because coyotes never. They mean they catch Fonz. They never catch a full grown buck like that. A full grown buck, a big 150 pound animal with giant Horn licious. Coyotes are like, that's too much work. Yeah, for the most part, I bet you a diet already.

Speaker 1:          01:16:26       And then came in here because the other one was kicking them away. They were like, let's eat this. End of wonder doesn't move. But they're connected together by the head. I don't know. Who knows? Interesting point being. This is my whole point at the beginning of all this nonsense. I think that the need for separateness, like the need to defend yourself, the need to attack the need for aggression was all instilled and whatever animal to human being ultimately became all instilled to allow it to stay alive through the darkest times, the most primal times. Because without that aggression, guess what? Fuck face. You're not going to make it to 2015. If you remove aggression from human history were bare food. We're coyote food. We're mountain lion. Food were, fill in the blank. If you remove the need to figure out a way to stop the world around you from swallowing you up, you need to have a certain amount of personal sovereignty and a certain amount of aggression.

Speaker 1:          01:17:28       You have to fight off anything that is predatory. Anything that has to threaten the survival of your very species until you figure out how to get it together. So go from the beginning when people made the first houses to figuring out how to make it gates to keep other people out, to figuring out how to, how to keep themselves safe from predatory animals and all those steps were like super necessary to get to today, but at a certain point in time, when do we outgrow that expression that were so dominant over all the other animals? We don't have to worry about that anymore and the only problem we have with each other, it seems to be like allocation of resources. I was about to say that's the big one. You Watch how fast people devolve. As soon as there's a. there's a limited source of water and you're going in their car or whatever, may not have enough water for the day.

Speaker 1:          01:18:18       That's when things get really interesting. It's all a question of this. What I mean, most of most tribes that fought there was always that situation. It was a fight over resources or water rights or whatever it might. You know that they're pioneering a new, a desalination plant in San Diego. They're going to spend some untold buckets, a load of cash. Yeah, and they're going to make this desalination plant. If that's true. What you want to do is buy real estate on Catalina island because it's going to be a road that leads out to the [inaudible]. We're going to dry out the ocean. People are creeps desalinization. Once they figured out desalinization, we're just going to be sucking the ocean off every day. We're just going to be pulling billions of gallons. People are like, if we don't stop drinking out of the ocean, it will be dry by 20, 75 by 20, 75.

Speaker 1:          01:19:10       All the water will be in like golf courses and bottled water facilities. There'll be no water in the whole ocean. Just big dry hole. Well, they did that. Went to the LLC. The LLC was the the ecological disaster. That was the llc and then it dried up in Russia and they dried up because people pulled the water out of it. It just. It would be a logical disaster for a lot of reasons and apparently the algae grew so much and there's too much hydrogen in the water and then it is a thousand things and they were siphoning the water off with dams and rivers and it became a disaster. Dried up articles, see eco disaster and saying, hey, go arrow, arrow, Arrow, Arrow, look out there and you can just see boats that are just on dry land. Huge Ocean liners. Now these things like how quick does do these things happen?

Speaker 1:          01:20:04       Like when, when, uh, see dries up, do they get a 10 year window? Do like, well, I think the LLC took about 40 years to dry out, but look at the boats out there that you still see that was all, see all of it. And, and because of mismanagement and, and, and using the water irresponsibly for agriculture. And so damming up parts of it, running off parts of it, they literally got rid of the C and that's, that's the eco disaster. So this was all because of human engineering? Yes. Oh my God. So that was a natural sea and human engineering lead it to dry up. That's. That's insane. Yeah. It's also very common, that kind of shortsighted thinking. But it is also fascinating because you're looking at the underlying mechanisms of the very thing we were talking about that this human animal is like figuring out all kinds of shit all the time and it has the power to reshape land now.

Speaker 1:          01:21:02       Make areas uninhabitable with an error, you know, or bring them to life with an error. Right. The salt and sea, the salt and sea for like a long time, like a couple of decades was this amazing spot where people would go on vacation. They called it like California's Riviera. There was a seed that they created by opening up the Colorado River. It was an accident. The whole thing was an accident. Well, you know, so now it's an eco disaster to it is. Oh yeah, now it's horrifically salty and filled with runoff from all the agriculture all across the state and all that shit that's trickling down from up north and all the water systems. It's going into there a lot of you getting runoff from farms and getting all sorts of fish. That's, that's where it is, man. They have millions of fish die off the salt and sea.

Speaker 1:          01:21:57       That's millions. The Salton Sea has so many dead bones on its beaches that its beaches are actually dried fish bones. Wow is beaches. There's entire beaches that are completely covered with white dead fish bones and you're walking in it and you don't realize until you look down on that gray. That is all that is. Fish bones to see that that person's walking, taking footsteps in fish bones that are so plentiful that they looked like sand and this is still efficient. It. Saddam Hussein was empower in Iraq. There was an area, um, I think in the south of Iraq. It was in their lives. People called. They called the Marsh Arabs who had been there for Millennia. And when he did, he found out that a lot of Iranian, you know, a lot of the Iranian forces were using it as sort of a hotbed of insurgency and also using it for our strategic stuff for the Iran, Iraq war.

Speaker 1:          01:23:00       He in one of the greatest ecological disasters ever committed by one man drained the entire marsh and go, if you go to pictures, good pictures of the Marsh Arabs in Iraq in the seventies and you'll see what it looked like. They, they'd been living there for thousands of years. Thousands. It goes all the way back to Alexander the Great and he drained it in the course of less than a year and burned. It gets back to what we were talking about when we were, um, in the car. We're talking about hardcore history in the Mongols at that, the way they used to live. Some people just take things that's a painting though. Some people just take things to a completely different level when it comes to like aggression and psychotic behavior and it becomes a total game changer. It just like no one knows what to do, takes hundreds of years to recover from what this person does.

Speaker 1:          01:23:51       Say that the Middle East never really recovered from what the Mongols did in 2012, 2012 slash six or 12 slash 20 or something, whatever it was, somewhere in the 1200 they were saying about Iraq. That was one of the big ones at Baghdad at one point in time was like one of the cultural centers of the world filled with intellectuals, but after the Mongols came to description was that the river ran red with blood and black with ink, so all of these scholars who at the time like people have this idea of Islam, especially when it comes to history like the history of the world as being just like barbaric or very violent group that's willing to kill you because they draw their. Their cartoon character guy was obviously. There are people like that out there that are because of that that believe in that. But if you go back to the history of the religion, like at one point in time they were at the front of the line when it came to science and philosophy.

Speaker 1:          01:24:46       They were at the front of the line and a lot of people argue that what the Mongols did literally changed the age of the enlightenment for them, right, because what it does, but it allowed what they did, the Chinese and the end, the Middle East, the allowed the Europeans who are nowhere close to as technologically advanced as philosophically or even as, as, um, culturally advanced as say the Middle East. It allowed them to gain ground on both China and the Middle East because of what the Mongols did to them because they destroyed in the course of, you know, over the years just destroyed that. The centers of their civilization, their infrastructure, their, their canals for, uh, agriculture, all of their. Essentially their culture killed their best and their brightest. Yeah, it's really amazing how many people were killed. When you look at the, the, the number that Dan Carlin site to somewhere around $50 million. They believe God the died within his lifetime as a result of the decisions that he made and the orders that he had carried out somewhere on 50 million people. He believed, you know, one of the things he ends up, he ends the thing with saying, I'm say we will, his, his for the force of his nature, the strength of his nature. He truly believed he was this divine spirit who had a mission

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       to remake the world in his, in his mind's eye, like he was the center of the universe and everything belonged to him and his legacy. So what a, what a, what a crazy way to think to begin with. And the fact that it worked and he did it all on horseback. Yeah. Did it all on horseback and he had an amazing ability, which one of the. One of the things I found most unique about this, a narration by Dan Carlin was when he was talking about how the guy would win, he would find people that were really talented, that were the enemy. He would recruit them like a guy shot him off of his fucking horse, shot his horse from under him, and then he made him one of his generals and he named him the Arrow call this Guy Chubby, chubby. The Arrow. Like the idea that you would take a guy who tried to fucking kill you and shot your horse out from under you and then say, dude, you're a pretty fucking good shot.

Speaker 3:          01:26:55       You give him some knuckles and you want to fucking kill everybody in the world together. Like our item in these guys know I had an orgy together or something. Did some opium and had a good old time. Yeah. He felt that he could spot talent. Well, he would take people that were. You would capture people and he would find out. Does anybody do anything? Any you motherfuckers have any skills because if you don't have any skills I'm going to kill you. But if you've got some skills, let me know what you do. Right. You know, and people would say I'm a surgeon or hey I don't whether even surgeons back then probably I could have been a. and how with that you would have been like, I'm a black belt in Jujitsu. What's that? Come roll with me. I'll show you some shit. C'Mon. Survive.

Speaker 3:          01:27:32       Oh, I would have to. That's what I would have to do. Blood. Come on when you bitches with Russell, just get them to see a team. Real quick bar. I bet they knew some shit actually need to think about it like in wrestling, but do you think it went back as far as $1,200? It had to have. It had to have been the. I don't know if much of they talked about it because they were so busy killing each other with arrows and swords and shit and spears and catapults. I don't think the wrestling was paramount. You're talking about a group of people though that that fought with their hands up close, eyeball to eyeball. Did it and I'm all the guys that we're talking about who are coming into your village or your town had had plenty of experience with that in that space.

Speaker 3:          01:28:15       When you're fighting for your life, when you're really killing somebody, I'd imagine it it. It's a very different muscle. If you're using very different muscles, you're using a very different mindset. So I would imagine they had a lot of Marshall Sense. They probably were pretty, pretty good with hand to hand combat. Yeah, they probably knew like. I mean, you think about like the, the early days of martial arts, there was most certainly a lot of faulty technique and faulty ideas that they had not taken the most, the most effortless path or the most technical path. They hadn't figured it out yet. Like there's, there's certainly some evidence that indicates that because by the time we got like the highest versions of martial arts in like the fifties and the sixties and seventies, if you really compare some of the top guys to like what's, what's possible today. It seems like it's evolved like many, many, many, many, many, many, many times.

Speaker 3:          01:29:08       You know, like. So I think Hector Lombard me down on any fucking Mongols, every one that ever walked there punching through your fucking stupid Mongols. But those Ruslan providing the cough type dudes does like the same type of dude. It's like that guy's an animal. Do you see those pictures of him and the post fight where he pissed black? No. Yes, he put it on his instagram. He's doing his urine sample and he pissed black. God. Yeah, him and Lucas. But I haven't even seen the fight yet. I got it saved on my dvr on the road. They went to war apparently is fucking unbelievable fight apparently. I haven't seen it. Is this, was this use Hbo Boxing? Oh, I'm sorry. Black urine shows. Real brutality of boxing. Like look at his instagram. He's this total is instagram. Look at that. Look at that picture, man.

Speaker 3:          01:29:59       That's it. That's on a diet coke. That's his piss. What? Yup. That's what his urine came out like. Oh No. After 12 arounds of. Whoa. God Damn it. That's crazy. Yeah. He's, he took. How about that fight with Bradley? It was the craziest one I've ever seen him. Amazing fight and I think that uh, that the genetics that come from that area from Siberia and from the step and Mongols and the genetics of survivors of hundreds of years, thousands of years of oppression and war and he's like almost a distillation of like the strongest, strongest survive just to be born and lived to maturity. People don't like that because it seems to like to indicate some sort of cruelty of nature, but I think to really not be objective about it is real cruelty because then you're. If you're not, if you're not expressing it for what it really is, you're not.

Speaker 3:          01:30:55       You're not seeing it for what it really is and expressing it in an honest way. If you're expressing it through an ideology, you doing everybody a massive disservice because it's pretty obvious that aggression was necessary and beneficial to get us to here. I think everybody recognizing that would help the idea of like, okay, so if we really did need to do certain military actions in order to stop certain psychos from, from growing and marching forward and taking over giant chunks of land just like they have throughout the Mongol days and this person and Filipinos and the grain, there's always been someone that does that. Right? So you need some sort of defense to hold that off or we agreed and then anybody who doesn't agree, then you've got a real Koombaya problem because he got to go, listen, dude, have you ever seen really crazy people?

Speaker 3:          01:31:46       Have you ever been around someone who's willing to kill you for money, for fame, for women, for women, and for your water? Water rights. There's. There's people out there that aren't playing by the rules. You're playing. Where did you grow up? Pasadena. That's a great place. Pasadena is a great plant. The Tar tar steps. It's not Istanbul. You fuck. It's not in the middle of. It's on the middle of Baghdad in a place that doesn't even have a roof anymore because the soldiers blew it off with their robot flying thing. No changes you. Yeah, of course it does. Of course it does. So anybody that doesn't think you need some sort of military force until that is all eradicated. So that becomes the real question. You've got to figure out how do you eradicate all the shitty pockets of life on earth. And I don't mean like eradicate the peep.

Speaker 3:          01:32:33       I mean eradicate the problems that make those people shitty and that seems to be by the way, because you, you have to eradicate the problems and the way a country, the institutions that that give rise to evil people. If you have a society that's structured, if you have institutions that are structured so that the only way to get ahead is if you're a bad. If you're. If you're an amoral motherfucker that then you're going to have people like gang gangs con at all. Rise to the top. You can't. It's the way society is structured, you know, they always talk about we have to cure poverty or whatever. The United States is powerful because of its strength of institution. It's powerful because we have courts that mean something because we have property rights where you own a house and you actually are secure as an American that somebody's not going to come in and take your house.

Speaker 3:          01:33:20       Very few countries share that luxury today in 2015 and courts that are objective that just because you have a lot of money, and I know this is there exceptions to this, but just because you have a lot of money, you're getting off for sure. No, we have courts where if you have a lot of money and you kill somebody and you get caught, you have big problems. If you're a cop and you're caught on video shooting, somebody you have big problem with. Cops don't have a lot of money, but rich people have been able to really finagle systems, good lawyers. That is a problem and it certainly is a problem, but not to the extent that it is in so many other countries. The corruption is not as blatant as it is in so many other countries. I think there's no denying that. I think the real question becomes, um, of, of one of the customary actions that we've taken.

Speaker 3:          01:34:02       Because W, what I mean by that is if you look at people from where we are right now at the 21st century, 2015, and you consider what people were like just maybe a 100 years ago, 200 years ago, like there's never really been a time where people have had this method of communicating with each other. So when we used to, we didn't, not only do we not know what was going on in Japan, we had no connection to it. You would read some stuff on paper. There's a guy from Japan and what's a fuck us up? This is crazy and you would have no connection to those people and you just knew there's a people over there just just like Lord of the rings, just like, you know, fill in the blank. Any war movie from the, you know, the mon goals to whatever the Romans, the, this idea that you would have this group of people that was waiting to come over and fuck you up. That

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       doesn't really work anymore. It does. Because there's satellites everywhere. We see everything. We send information, everybody. But this has all happened inside of our lifetime, so there's been a change that's taken place that I don't think we're really fully aware of yet. There's this weird connection thing that we have to literally, everybody on the world will also remember that when you had an enemy, even as far as even in World War II with the first thing you did was you got your soldiers to believe that, that that enemy they were. They were subhuman, they weren't human, they were subhuman and you see it over and over again. Again, that's becoming harder and harder to do. Dan Carlin not to bring it back to him, was also talking about how when you fought them enemy in world war one and you, you encountered your first line of Germans or whatever.

Speaker 2:          01:35:45       You didn't know how far back that line went. You didn't know if there are a million of them or if there were 100,000 or 2000. So you just fought sort of not knowing to not only the effect you're having on their, on their forward momentum, but also on their general population to begin with. Like you were fighting and when they stopped fighting it, then you find out, Holy Shit, there were a million of them. We just fought these guys, so just think about that. Now we know where their regiments are. We know how far back they go. We know exactly how many people there are. We can plan accordingly and not only that we can talk to each other. That's what was missing was missing was the only people that are talking to each other with generals. The generals and presidents were like the only people talking to each other.

Speaker 2:          01:36:32       Listen Bitch, we're gonna fuck you up. Nope, we're going to fuck you up for God, Bitch. God's on our side. And wars would start because of these alliances and they would just, they would just be like, well, we're going to fight and break this alliance and then you'd find out about it as a, as a citizen, you'd be like, but I'm farming my land. No, no. How the fuck that Japanese got together with the Germans and the Italians. How the fuck did that happen? Which war? World War II. Like would it be. I mean, I know how it happened, but how the fuck if you look at the personalities of the different groups of people and the languages they speak three completely different fucking languages, three complete, completely different types of people and all their dictated had a lot of trade and a lot of connection. I mean, but, but one of the things that the Germans, I mean, Hitler wanted to create an access, sort of an access to a sort of a new world order and he had a great deal of respect for the Japanese.

Speaker 2:          01:37:21       He considered the Japanese, the Ariens of the east, and he had enormous respect for the British really areas of the. He loved their yellow fever, Szeto, which was the idea that way of the warrior. Japan had been in a low grade war for a civil war for really a thousand years. I mean, it was just constant battles between Laura feudal shoguns like these, these, these fiefdoms shogun would run fiefdoms. He'd hire mercenaries and they would just fight for land. And that went on for a really 310 years, about a thousand. That's why the swordsman and their ability, they're there, they were legendary archers and they were just legendary and ferocious. I mean, when the Portuguese were trading with them, they came back and the first thing they said to their European rulers is they said, hey, couple things you don't want them doing, learning how to sail long distances and learning about a little something we call gunpowder. Don't give them gunpowder. They are straight up the most ferocious group of motherfuckers on the planet. If they're late for something, they immediately request to kill themselves because they've dishonored their, their, their fanatical to authority. And you know, that, that, that Plu, this tiny island took up, took over a great deal of the world. Um, they, they, there, they were insanely warlike and impossibly disciplined

Speaker 3:          01:38:44       and their version of martial arts. So this day is being taught. I mean, once you understand all the, like Leo Machida who lost this weekend, but still, you know, a great all time fighter and he's an amazing martial artist and his styles showed, oh, con based. It's based on that style is another two dozen Japanese mentioned. So really Jujitsu is as well, I mean Brazilian Jujitsu was modified by the gracies, modified by Helio and, and Carlos Carlos, they modified it in turned Jujitsu into what it would ultimately become. They spent much more time on the ground fighting then the judoka cause. But a lot of the judo cause even like a lot of their techniques came from, there was an infusion of techniques where there's some sort of a blurry crossroads between catch wrestling and judo and some catch wrestlers. I'm also taught in Japan, like Karl gotch and Billy Robinson, those guys taught a lot of people in Japan, like Sakharova was a student of catch wrestling.

Speaker 3:          01:39:42       And so he imparted that like sort of, uh, a lot of catch wrestling, submission holds that style of attacking. He incorporated that in a lot of MMA fights and started a lot of people, not just in Japan but all over the world fighting that style. So I think there's like, there's many different versions of what Japan has brought out to the rest of the world. There's many different versions. But as far as like martial arts, it's one of the biggest contributors. Like ever, they just figured out I quito, they figured out judo that figured out Jujitsu and figured out submissions in a way that you really can't find parallel at the time. I definitely think that the Jujitsu is better now than ever before and I think I credit that to the Brazilians. I credit that to the gracies in Brazil to this day still has a huge number of super high level Jujitsu guys worldwide.

Speaker 3:          01:40:34       It's evening out way more than it ever has before, but I mean just the overall output and the origins of it in the fact that it's still called Brazilian Jujitsu. Everybody calls a Bjj for a reason. Yep. You know, they, they, they deserve all the credit. And then there's still guys like Jocko ray with jock already did this weekend and Chris Kamozi that armbar setup that transition, like it's such a hero magician, artistic, artistic. It was one of the most spectacular forms of, of like a submission of applying a submission in a scramble that I've ever seen. Me Too. I was just, I didn't even know that he's doing. And what, um, how do you defend against that? You can't defend against that. He's an artist. I was going to put it on my twitter feed. I'll re a retweet it earlier today, but I think grappling world on twitter, I think that's the ones who put it up.

Speaker 3:          01:41:19       It's uh, they, they put up a little 15 second gif. I guess it is. Whatever it is on instagram and you get to watch it. It's, it's insane. He's so good. He's so God damn good. It makes you wonder though, like with the Japanese going back to them how good they were at as swordsmen, like what they could've done. The Samurai. So that's again, I think what we were talking about, what the Mongols like, they spent so much time on weapons because that's how you fought most of the time. Like how much time are they really spending on learning how to kick people in the face? Yeah. It's probably like a lot of what we think about the way people used to kick and punch and it's based on movie depictions of it and in movies like enter the dragon or in these kind of crazy movies there.

Speaker 3:          01:42:03       They're trying to do the most impressive stuff so they're throwing. We'll kicks and jumping, roundhouse kicks and jumping side kicks butt in real combat. Like Bruce Lee wrote very extensively about real combat situations. Like he was always like completely fascinated by the concept of utilizing minimum effort, incorporating all the best techniques from all different martial arts and only doing what's effective in discarding what's useless. And He, you know, the Tao of Jeet Kune Doe he wrote like extensively, but all sorts of different martial arts even like lifted whole packages like paragraphs from other martial arts books and put them in there and people will say like, oh, he's plagiarizing. Well, no, no, no. This is what he was doing was collecting all the information. Now whether he attributed it to this book or it should have or I don't know. Yeah, I agree intellectually probably it's not the most honest thing to do.

Speaker 3:          01:42:53       To not credit, maybe he did credit, but my point is what his art was, was absorbing everything. He didn't invent any new techniques, but what he did was he took the best stuff out of everywhere and he incorporated a system based on his knowledge at the time who took in judo from Jean lift arm bars and I don't like the way you're talking about him in the past tense. He suggested there's dead person's dead brother. I guess you haven't read the secret history of a lot of these. Yeah, but my point was that like that guy, what he had done is really kind of, um, not just unprecedented, but he was like the first big blip of this new concept, this new concept of just do what you want, what was possible and do what's useful. Everybody else before was in a tribe. I was in the shadow con karate tribe.

Speaker 3:          01:43:46       You're in the, you know, Gung Fu tribe. This guy's in the judo tribe and there was very little exchanging of information. You know, I, I only started exchanging information when I got started getting involved in kickboxing because I didn't have good boxing technique, so I started working at a boxing gym and then I started hanging out with a dude who's doing some Moitai as well, and then I started learning about like leg kicks and all these different things and I remember thinking, God damn, I was so wrong. Like the camp of taekwondo was good for a bunch of things, but it wasn't good for any of these things these guys were doing to me. I'm like, dammit, there's some holes in this motherfucker and that's the only way you would find out. The only way you would find out is by exploring these other martial arts.

Speaker 3:          01:44:23       But until Bruce Lee came along, that was taboo. You were a trader. If you went to a different gym to train, you are a fucking trader. I know. I remember having been a wrestler and then I went to Iowa, Dan Gables camp for, I think it was two weeks. It was a nightmare and three weeks and you know, and I got to wrestle with some of that. Those Ncaa like Jim's Alaska, those, those, those hawkeyes as like as a 17 year old and having wrestled I, I kind of, I knew I had a real appreciation for what are really good [inaudible] college wrestler was about, you know, and not because not because I ever. I rolled around with those guys but not because I was just hit, they were teaching us, but I knew, I knew what tough high school wrestlers were like and then to think about don wrestlers and then I started taking taekwondo when I went to Washington dc and I say someone of my friends, I'd be like, just know that if you're in a bar and you see a dude with closed up here and he looks like he wrestled in college, that's the guy to be afraid of it.

Speaker 3:          01:45:20       I'm a beer. Buy Him a beer man. Buy Him a beer because even if you punch him, punch them. Right. I may have gone. I love knowing. I was like, I don't know if my kicks are going to work. He has to do with it. In a way, it's kind of what we're talking about. We were talking about the Mongols were the mongols lived this life of constant strain and effort and they were so strong and the strong survive anyway, like as far as like how many people lived in tents? Man, these motherfuckers were constantly at war. I'm sure their genes that with what they had was warrior genetics and those people when they encountered regular soft people that lived inside these cities like they were, they were like predators to them. I mean they, they, they had disdain for these people, like they were sheep, like they were cattle because they were so fucking strong.

Speaker 3:          01:46:09       I mean, when you're dealing with a guy who's goddamn amateur wrestler, a serious competitive amateur wrestler, you're dealing with acute has probably been wrestling since he was a bay. It's all reaction for him. Everything's reaction. Not only that his body has developed by throwing bodies around dented and much like you can't understand what it's like to lock up with that gorilla you. You can understand how much stronger a division one wrestler is the new. You really don't know. No. Like you really probably have no. Unless you ever wrestled with one of those dudes and it has them grab, grab them, grab a hold your wrists and pin you down and, and get out of submissions like it's nothing. Or you feel their posture power there like several times stronger than times. That's right. If you get a guy who's like, look, here's a perfect example, Habib Neuroma gamete off.

Speaker 3:          01:46:56       Okay. That motherfucker's a world samba champion. It's a different kind of wrestling, but the point is he uses all wrestling. If you watch him fight, he's a relentless grappler and when he gets a hold of dudes, they were shocked at how fucking strong I rewatched that does Tanya's fight and the way he was, the science is a monster monster and he was just. He was like a, like an octopus, just like a fucking, just wouldn't get off his back. He's a motherfucker to it. Any motherfuckers, everybody like that. He motherfuckers, everybody liked. I'm so excited about this fight with cowboy because I really want to see what cowboy does to stop him and I really want to see how he does with cowboy fighting. Cowboy on top because cowboys guard is fucking nasty. No, I don't. I don't think we've ever seen anybody threatened Habib with any sort of submission attempts before and I wonder what would happen in Dos Anjos didn't get a chance man, but dos Anjos has never been like a guard player.

Speaker 3:          01:47:49       You know, he's not a big time guard player is more of a top smash you guys. Yeah, he's really good man. He's so God damn good. Like what he did to pettis was like, yeah, that mother strong too. He's strong. Aggressive. But with Donald and cubby. But I wonder if. First of all, I think Donald has better hands and feet. Well, he definitely does. Yeah. He definitely is a better striker, but Habib is just so much stronger when it comes to grappling. But Donald, unlike the other guys is dangerous off his back. Donald has a nasty triangle. Sounds throws down. Yes he is. He's a long. He's got an awesome check. Need. The body throws that check knee with the left side. He fucks guys up and he, he mirrors it a lot of times or hides it behind punches. Like Donald, you'll see, we'll throw punches where he's not even intended to hit you.

Speaker 3:          01:48:36       He just getting you look at these and if you think of moving in and then boom, that need comes to the body. He fucks guys up with that. He's putting on a show for you. Manage dancing like a cobra. Know he hides, kicks behind punches like he did that when he fought. Um, Jim Miller, he showed him the right hand and boom, the net kick was right behind it. You know, you're looking at that right hand and his fucking neck kit comes along, Bang, and your legs go out. He's a cubby and this is going to be crazy. He's a motherfucker. Motherfuckers Donald's a motherfucker and Habib's a motherfucker that isn't a mate that could be easily a world championship fight. That's easily world championship caliber fighter. They asked him about conor mcgregor and caboose is a very good fighter, but if he wants to come to one of the 55, his welcome.

Speaker 3:          01:49:24       I make him welcome, swell job keeping that guy off you. If you're supposed to be fighting 10 pounds lighter, look, especially if you don't. If you're not arrested first. Yeah, well you listen man, I'm not. I don't. I wouldn't say that connor can't fight at 1:55. What I would say that if he's competing successfully at the top, at 1:55, 45, like he is right now, the transition time, unless he's some Mexicans supplements, there's gonna be a long transition time to put on the, the right amount of weight to compete at that level. World of difference, right? Yeah. Because he's pretty elite at 1:45 in his movement, in his endurance, like he's not having any problems and he hasn't. Granted he hasn't been in a real war and that's what everybody really wants to see. Everybody really wants to see him against a wrestler because everybody we've seen is tried to stand up with him and he's got nasty hands man, nasty power, nasty accuracy, super, super aggressive with his striking disdainful almost with his stance and his movement towards you.

Speaker 3:          01:50:20       It's shocking his confidence. I think that fucks with a lot of people's heads, man. A lot of people when he comes at you and he's been talking shit about you for months already made you feel like an asshole, you can't give you the courage, you know, everybody's thinking like, and then by the time you get in there like you've suffered a mental beating already, whether you know it or not, like you're, you're at a deficit. I said, I asked him where his confidence comes from. So why, how did you like, uh, you know, he said, Tj, he's how it has two belts. He was a European national champion in boxing, has got another belt for something else. But I said, where does this come from? This is my work ethic. I said, I know, but a lot of guys were crying because they tanked. They work hard, but they don't.

Speaker 3:          01:50:58       I my eye, if it does not involve the fight game, it does not involve me. And that was it. He goes, other guys have extracurricular activities. I don't. I count my money and I fight. And those are the two things I like to do. He's a game changer, game changer. He's like shale times to best thing that ever happened to Jose. Aldo is career profile. It'll, unless it goes down the way connor thinks it's going to go down, then it's probably the worst thing to have some guy come along and humiliate and then fuck you up and you leave with a check. You were one of the best pound for pound fighters in the world, but if connor could do to him what he did, the Dustin Poirier, that would be the most shocking thing we've ever seen inside the. It'll be crazy. Do you compare a dozen poirier as a fighter to Jose?

Speaker 3:          01:51:38       Aldo is not. No, and that's no disrespect to dustin because I think Dustin was doing himself a disservice by cutting down at 1:45. I thought you look fucking sensational. His last fight, he looked amazing at 55. He looked, look comfortable. They look thick, was moving while he still fast as shit. I think Dustin's a big boy and I think those guys had cut down to 45 like that or fuck, it's your body's getting tortured and you can kind of bounce back from it. And when you're younger, it's easier than when you get older, when you've been in the game a long time and your body has been taken kicks and punches and you know you're dehydrating and every few months and then rehydrating it, like after a while that's shit is going to pay. You're going to pay a price, it's going to pay its toll. And um, you, I think that a guy who is a really good fighter that cuts less weight and has a less great advantage but has a full healthy body and all of the endurance that comes with that and all the peace of mind knowing that you slept well and ate well and your body feels really rested and you probably are better off somewhere on the comfortable side of that than in the comfortable side of too dehydrated because those are the people that wind up looking almost like there's points where they're almost like helpless because their body has dehydrated so much.

Speaker 3:          01:52:54       And the grueling newness of the fight. There's some guys you never see do it. Some guys pull it off like Benson Henderson. He pulls it off, man. He pulls it off like you never see that guy tired, you never see that guy worn out and he loses a lot of weight. But then when you saw him fight against brandon batch, what you saw is one guy who was enormous batch who's a huge for one seven. He cuts a lot of weight so big and Benson wasn't cotton, hardly any weight at all, if any, to fight at one 70 because usually fights it time especially and great and part of it you have to consider is that Benson is a guy with way more experience, way more ways to win and a way better ground game. I mean Benson has a legitimate blackbelt ground game and his, his, his manager and trainer, John Crouch, he's legit as they come.

Speaker 3:          01:53:40       Like Benson is super good on the ground. He's very good on the ground despite the fact that pet is condom in that arm bar. That was just so God damn quick and perfect. Yeah. But when you look at his real ground game, like when he fucked that, she realized like, you know what man? It'd be like, it might be better if he fought bigger guys and he was healthy. It might be better because he's so technical, like it's not a big, it's like the guys who rely on slugging it out and smashing and hulk smashing dudes. Those guys have to be really big for their way class. But the guys who fight like Benson or like Frankie, super technical, super endurance constantly on you, you know, always cutting angles, always making you work, always pushing. You. Always putting pressure on you. I think Benson Henderson is, is, you know, can keep me with anybody in 70.

Speaker 3:          01:54:22       Certainly Robbie lawler and, and uh, any of those guys and Johnny Hendricks, he's kind of very similar. He's just as tall, might be a little shorter. But for the most part I think that there's nobody in the 70 pound weight class that I think gives him a beating, including Carlos. Well, you know, he mean he could be a champion at one seven and everybody says that's ridiculous because it's so. But look, man, that fucking weight classes, nuts, right? Anybody in any given night in that weight class could be a champion. Same with 55. Rory Macdonald can be a champion. Robbie lawler is the champion. I mean, either one of those guys could be champion, you know, I mean condit could still. He champion Woodley could be championed, hugged her lumbar, could be champion. I forgot. I keep forgetting about it. Guys like hector, he's out for a year.

Speaker 3:          01:55:06       Yeah. Steroids for the juice is my friend had the juices study said that anybody who does steroids should be banned for life. And he says my. Someone gave him a drink. My friend rubbed oil on his body. I think it was looking a. This is some translation issues between Spanish and English or the pharmacy man. Fucking nose gave him something. We talk about the 85 pound weight class. Seventy pounds. I forget about him and I forgot about guys like Yoel Romero and. Well he's 70 now. He went down to 17 hectors at one 70. Um, but you'll all Romero, he's another one. That was a bummer that he didn't get to Rey this weekend. What happened to him is he got hurt, he hurt his knee, dammit. Fuck. That was an insane fight. And then became an insane demonstration. See if you could find that. That Jeff of Jacques Rey Armbar and Chris Kamozi I think.

Speaker 3:          01:55:59       I think if I had to put money on the Yoel Romero shocker, a fight I go with, with A. Because I, I still think your morale or if he's fighting five rounds, if it's four and five, he starts to gas because he's just, there's so much muscle to feet. So the top one is the guard pass, which was equally ridiculously impressive. And the bottom one is the actual arm bar. Jamie. Yeah, that's the guard pass. We just look all the weight he put on them with a one shoulder. Whereas whole bodies up priest turn off ad block. Fuck you man. Bitches running scripts on your ships, find it on another, go to another website. Um, but anyway, point being this, uh, this, this era that we're living in right now was like greatest ever for martial arts I think. I don't think there's ever been a time ever in my life where I've seen this level of execution on a scale like this.

Speaker 3:          01:56:54       It just didn't exist before. It didn't exist. When you combine the skill level of the kickboxers, like the glory kickboxers skill level of the guys that are coming out of Thailand, you know, it's just all right. Everybody sharing their own techniques, we will call. Well, you can watch them online now too. That helps a lot. And there's. I just think that overall Jujitsu, Muay Thai, kickboxing and mma, I don't think there's ever been a time that has been even close to be represented the way martial arts to represent it today. But that's just part of it. The real impressive thing was the, uh, the transition to that. They were going a scramble. That's just the end of it. They were in a scramble and jock array, a dove on his arm and threw a leg over and then hooked him under his leg to keep them from rolling out of it and then scoot his hips to the left and I was watching.

Speaker 3:          01:57:49       I was like, that is art. That's ballet. He's a master. I think something else was happening right away, right? Yeah. I knew it was going for the arm. As soon as I saw him, I think I probably yelled at how he's diving for an arm, but I could tell that he, he does that all the time. Some guys don't like to do that because it's a tricky transition between like sometimes from the back. Some guys will say, you know what? This guy is defending the choke to good. I'm going to set up the arm bar. Like, um, who smart Paul Horez did that to Ivan salivary. He went from the back to an arm bar. There's a video of him doing that same exact transition to a gym to. I'm Jason Miller. I think that, uh, he's got a lot of techniques like that where he can transition from the back to something else.

Speaker 3:          01:58:33       Jaggery does like, he's got like levels of transitions that other people just don't know. Like I was watching combos and OSC Kamozi trying to figure out what Rey was doing while he was doing it and it was just, it was so high level. Dude. It was so high level, like if you're a guy who does Jujitsu and you watch how, how this transitioned flows. This is not it. You got to go through. It's before that. Yeah. But it's before that. It's not, it's they missed the whole thing. So this is just an arm bar. This is an bar and it's impressive, but that's not what's impressive. What was impressive was the full transition go to that grappling world, uh, instagram grappling world on instagram. That's where I said it was a, you could see the whole thing, but the way he does it, it's like you have to have this insane knowledge of where to put your legs in the transition where he's going to likely wind up where his legs going to kick and there's so much data that he's calculating and it's all based on technique.

Speaker 3:          01:59:31       Just like very minimal effort, like none of that that he did with strength. And that's like the most pure expression of martial arts. I mean certainly strong as fuck strengths certainly aided him and pulling off the moon. Don't get me wrong, but what I'm saying is that move was pulled off because of his perfect technique. I mean, you have to be physically strong person to do anything to a Jujitsu person, but there was no resistance there. If you look, there was defense, but the way he moved into that position, he was never resisted because he was so far ahead of Kamozi. Technically like in the dive commodities, like, Oh shit. He's diving going, oh fuck. He was already set. He was adamant. He was way ahead of. Yeah, he's way ahead of when you roll with really good guys, they. They are ahead of you.

Speaker 3:          02:00:13       They've been there before. They've seen what you're going to do. They can predict what you're going to do and sometimes if they're really good, they can get you to think you're going to do something you do that. They already know you're going to do that, and then they capitalize. That's what makes shocker a truly special. No, there's two. There's two running right now for the number one contender after this, Chris Weidman, Vito Belfort fight. There's shock array and who won on the quote and then Luke rockhold. Yeah, and I think Luke rockhold made a giant statement by beating Machida and smashing them with a choke hold. Beat. Shocker, right? Yes. Yes, he did. He did your take on that, but there's a very good fight. Look, I think rockhold against anybody is a very good fight. Rockhold is a mother fucker, dude. There's no denying it now after what?

Speaker 3:          02:00:53       He did a good looking guy either. The only reason why anybody gets laid is because rockhold didn't get their first got there. First do. It'd be no pussy for anybody else. That's the bottom line is hansel bastard, but more importantly what it does inside the octagon is super unusual. Man. He's a long guy is like Javier Mendez explained it to me in the cage after the fight and I was congratulating him and Bob Cook. Javier said he's long and he's strong and usually don't get those two together. Oh, because he's a long dude, but he's also yoked as fuck. He's not like a long, skinny Roger Gracie type grappler. He's long and he's yoked and he trains on a daily basis with Kane motherfucking full last name. Oh, that's right. It's in Daniel motherfucking. Call me every everyday. These guys going to war with the biggest killer the heavyweight division has ever known outside of Baltimore.

Speaker 3:          02:01:44       This is just two guys that you would never consider to be the greatest heavyweight cyber. There's one who's in the UFC. He came to Alaska as in one from pride, fader politics. Both of them are. Don't have. If I saw them on the beach, I would be like, that guy used to work out perfect. Say perfect way of describing fader. Yeah. He used to work out well in the day. The earlier days of his career, he was a little thicker. Like there's been this picture of him standing in front of the Kettlebell is. Yeah. What a great picture to jerk off to. I've dropped the number of loads, straightened loads, but still I'm like, are you rushing? Rushing, bear size of your tendons are bigger, right? Your trash. Oh Gosh. Dog Legs Stud all time greats insertion cabs. I mean, uh, it's, it's hard to say. He doesn't shave his chest, he does, he does he fuck.

Speaker 3:          02:02:35       It's hard to say like who would have won in a fight in his prime versus cane in his prime because they came in in two totally different errors and if you want to look at accomplishments, boy, it's really hard to discount cro, cop beat and or fate or being cro, cop fate or beaten pretty much everybody they put in front of them and in pride, I mean he really beat some of the best in the world and the heavyweight division in pride back then was probably outside of Tim Silvia and Frank Mir, who in their prime could give anybody a hard time. That was probably the strongest heavyweight division the world has ever known because everybody, first of all, I was allowed to do all sorts of Mexicans. She can do whatever the fuck you wanted and you were dealing with guys who were fighting for a lot of fucking money.

Speaker 3:          02:03:21       I mean there was a. You got. Think about it. You Got Alexander Million Inco, you've got cro, cop, you got cro cop in his prime when he was head kick and ventilate asleep, you know. Oh my cookie mooglie. You've got Minataro who was fighting off his back and triangling Mark Cole, but off his back, like call in in his prime crazy. Coleman was strong as fuck. It was nothing to triangle. Just a head and shoulders. Minataro when he was off his back was special dude. He, he was. He represented a thing that no one had ever seen before. A real legit Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt. Who's a fucking bonafide heavyweight who strangles guys off his back because he was the mentor. He. You, you got lost in the maze of his Jujitsu or what was it? That's a good question. I don't know. I'm going to guess that's what it is because you don't want to get lost in minute.

Speaker 3:          02:04:12       Charles Mayes, maybe it's just like he's half bull. So fucking strong. Yes, it's tough. She was tough. Shit. Just started another lap. Just another level of toughness. So you think about minotauro. Okay. Fate or beat him in his prime and fader beat cro cop in his prime. They never. Josh Barnett and him never fought. When he was in Josh. Josh was in his prime. Kevin Randleman. Remember that he beat Kevin Randleman flex. No, Kevin, right. Got an arm bar just moments later. So it's not good enough. I'll break this. Okay. Top. That was the craziest transition dude. He was a motherfucker. He was a motherfucker. Fader was a motherfucker, but if I like it, it's timing with those shots. Fantastic. And his ability to knock guys out and he's saying uh, and Andre Arlovski knocked him out in the air, but that was by the way a fight where our last, he was picking them apart and that was a fight where a lot of people looked at what?

Speaker 3:          02:05:09       This guy's got some holes and it was also a fight where he was criticized by his old trainers. Trainer was saying, you know, he's up to his old tricks. He won with a trick like, but they didn't prepare for this properly. His trainer was vocal about that. That training with Freddie Roach, I think. I think you're right. Yeah, well Arloski got crazy and went with that flying knee and if he didn't go with the flying knee, who knows what would happen if you continue to pick them apart like that. It could have been crazy. It could have been crazy to watch fate or get kick boxed, you know, but Arlovski, at least on paper was a, you know, very formidable kickbox and threatened. He had like one punch knockout power lasers straight right hand me through a right hand that when he knocked out Paul blend like early in the first round, he threw a right hand.

Speaker 3:          02:05:51       It was like a bolt. So to really comes off his shoulder hits you in your genuine. You know what the fuck happened? He's so fast. When Arlovski was in his prime dude, people were terrified of him. Remember the first time he came in there, they get this 240 pound guy moved like a small man. Would that pony tail? Well, when fader or gone to him, he had lost a few and he'd been out of the UFC in fighting for affliction, you know, but I'm still still was pretty formidable five rounds. Who knows, that's the problem. It's like you'd have to have a time machine. You'd have to coordinate like you know when, what version of cane before the first fight with junior dos Santos before the second fight with junior dos Santos, you know, I mean junior dos Santos knocked him out in the first fight and then they went to fucking war for two fights in a row.

Speaker 3:          02:06:40       And those fights, you got to think like, man, you fade or obviously lost a step somewhere along the way and you have to attribute it if you don't attribute it to his focus. I don't know what his focus wasn't training his coaches saying something like that. It could be that he was kind of getting tired of fighting or it could be the god wars he went through. I mean, nobody rides for free when it comes to those crazy fucking 10 minute rounds of sparring sessions that he would go through, you know, meet me. We were talking to Tony Jeffries about this and he was calculating and he was. He had 106 fights, 26 of which were pro I think. And he said if you look at all the rounds I fought to prepare for those 106 fights and this is when I became an amateur is not when I was a kid. He calculated it. He takes about. He took over 55,000 shots that God to him, $5,000 and so crazy and call for a lot of boxers because you've got to take into account the, the, the five

Speaker 1:          02:07:35       jabs. Just the five jobs you'd take around. Even if they're light when you're sparring. It's so crazy, so crazy when you know, when you just think about all the different micro injuries and different times that Brian's rattling against the skull. Different little things that have the connective tissue that's separating or twisting or popping or I know, but don't you need some of that in life? Like I was going to ask you, you know trauma? No, I. well somebody didn't call his pockets. This French general I think are a British general said we have to have war because if a man doesn't have war will will, will dissolve into materialism. I thought all right, whatever that sounds like a general but. But there is something to be said about a conflict free world as we were talking about and I was wondering like, and I was just trying to like draw a through line to the people.

Speaker 1:          02:08:23       I really connect with my really good friends, the friends that I have and it's not that there will be on their list, but you are, but it's not that they're all fighters and unnecessarily, but they definitely have and continue to sort of live in a world that is not, of course like the Mongols, but they keep themselves a little uncomfortable. They are always in touch with kind of coming up with their own, with a sense of reality. Well, that's what I told you that before. You're the only dude that I'd ever asked to go to Montana to sleep when it's 90 degrees outside in a little cloth house was horrible that nobody, none of nobody other. None of the other comics we know are really good at are going to hack that. I don't think Duncan and I love him. And, and, and Tony Hinchcliffe are gonna Kinda like hiking up those mountains in that cold.

Speaker 1:          02:09:09       Tony might get down with it. I'm telling you, Tony Micah done with it. That little fucker is. He's, he's a little weasel. Really shouldn't say weasel. It should say uh, I meant to say he's a golden pony. I meant badger and he's a determined little. He's like, weasels are tough little fucking animals by the way. That's a weird thing. Like weasel became somehow or another toughest shame. An asshole like weasels killed cobras, don't they? Well, I think family, they're, they're tough little fuckers. You say weasley like all the dudes Weasley, right? I mean, he's, he's, he's not to be fucked with. Tony will rise up. He will figure it out with a pack on his back and that cult. You know what man? Physically, not exactly designed for it. He's not designed for it, but he's a tough little fucker. Look at that. This photo of a baby weezer flying.

Speaker 1:          02:09:57       That's at Photoshop. Oh, come on. Someone caught this. A baby weasel. How did he get on his bird? I don't believe it. Well, why don't you believe it? It can happen. Really? Yeah. The world's crazy. Why is that so weird? Hats. Amazed. Some baby weasel figured out how to jump on this fucking birds back. Tell me right now. I think it's completely photoshop. Listen, we know weasels exist. We know birds can fly. Why would it be so hard to imagine perhaps the weasel jump on his back and they went home with venture. All the fucking variables in the luck in the world when it comes to wildlife that couldn't take place. Watch this. I don't think that bird would be able to have the, uh, to be able to. Hang on. Let's look at this little, but also that weasel doesn't have any strength. That's a baby at parts. Not letting that reason a him. Jamie, please snopes this and get back to us with the final results. It's actually real. Wow. Come on. Jimmy says, it's actually real. Still crying. I'm still calling bullshit. Don't call bullshit. Wow. There's another picture of it. Weasel catches a ride on a woodpecker was that guy. That guy's a liar. That's fucked up.

Speaker 1:          02:11:02       That's the guy who caught it on camera. Wow. Better not be lying dude. Phase lines. Those hacks. Sores. Dudes are gonna. Find you. They'll find you can't lie to them. Yeah. They have elite skills with the photoshop layers. Remember that like these photoshop guys were going over the fucking image that Obama's birth certificate. It's clearly been Dr. and photoshop. Photoshop the. Do you know anything about that Jamie? The layers of the photoshop argument when it comes to Obama's. Obama's birth certificate was doctored in Photoshop. I'll show you doctor, if you watch, if you. If you take it apart, the image is several files. Some of them fucking Kenya. Several from several. Five. How about this? How about he's from Hawaii, which is not America anyway. How about that? You know, buys from a fucking. He's from a country we stole from a tropical island. Really Nice Group of people.

Speaker 1:          02:11:59       Yeah, they were sweet. We say it's an island. It's just a small country. That's what it is. I agree. Hawaiians are Hawaiians. They're not Americans. They are American and since they will take the meal and protect them with the constitution in the military of the United States of America, never forget the nr there in our protectorate. Look at Brock, but what I'm saying is Hawaii. Oh Shit. There's two different pictures and they photo shopped him in there maybe. Hm. Huh? Where's the hand? Where's that left hand? He's got an upper ass in that second picture. Just this is not real. Oh, these are hilarious. These are hilarious. Chunk of your edge missing. Oh Jesus Christ. It's not even a high resolution photo. You fucking Weirdos till they understand the difference between looking at something with a white background and looking at something with a black background. Go up to that ear.

Speaker 1:          02:12:52       I'll just prove this right now. You fucking dummy. They see the difference. See where the transition is. The transition is right where the white meats, the black, you know why it happened because the camera picks it up again to bring it back. This is becoming the Dan Carlin podcasts, but he said something really cool about how people like conspiracy theories because it's really hard to believe that the random just happens where that one man like Lee Harvey Oswald can change the course of history with a bullet and that's a lot harder to believe than you know, a group of people who were very organized ended up doing what they did and it's human. We all want. We want to a logical explanation, not a random one, not the fact that we're fragile enough that one man can fuck everything up with

Speaker 3:          02:13:32       with a good bullet or a good bomb. It's just, it's that time where that was possible. I wonder if that's possible today and it's certainly to a lesser extent, like there's certainly there's a weirder connection that people share today than they've ever done before and I wonder how much we realize about how that's shaping society's shaping. Just human civilization as a human, you know, we were talking about before as a gigantic super organism, super organism that relied on aggression to get to a certain point of innovation and then once it got to that certain point of innovation, what, when does it no longer need aggression and when does it need like a realization of what it actually is instead of aggression. When does it need a real realization like, listen, listen, the only way that's going gonna work out for everybody as we got to act for everybody.

Speaker 3:          02:14:21       That's the only way. If the human race just treats everybody that way, like you have to find where the weak spots are. Prop them up, figure out why they're fucked up, engineered correctly. You know, as far as social engineering, education, counseling are you saying that we should do unto others as you'd have them do unto us as rabbi hello and a guy named Jesus Christ said, and once you get to a point where you have something called the Internet and people can exchange these ideas and exchange these, these points of view and these expressions like, this is how I feel about you, is how you feel about me. When you communication like this, you can communicate like this in real time in a way that's never happened before. So they're not like these weird people in Germany that you don't know that. Or they have this guy standing on top of a podium and he's screaming shit out and you're like, what's going on over there?

Speaker 3:          02:15:09       Why are they all marching? Why they all goose step in like that? What are they doing with the Jews? Like, what the fuck is going on over there? And you're reading things about it in the paper and you're trying to take these little printed words and piece them into a narrative that makes sense in your head. You're reading the New York Times every morning to find out what's the news, what the with Europe, what's going on over there without boys and you want to look into the paper trying to find out how the score is the war and you're listening to the radio at night, the fucking radio. You're listening to the radio to Kranich's blaming. You would go to the movies and they would show a clip, a highlight war, real clip of the news while you're waiting for your movie to start. I know what the fuck.

Speaker 3:          02:15:49       I'm very controlled to the. Your information was controlled. War was actually was actually kind of presented in a very sanitized way as well and in many ways still is like the idea that when you get hit with heavy artillery, you come apart. There are not holes in your body. We don't show a lot of that stuff. Probably shouldn't lonely, shouldn't. We? Wouldn't. Wouldn't be. It'd be good for people to know what the fuck they're signing. I know. I know that the. I know that the logic was always that you censored media during war time and didn't let them show the really horrific stuff because it was bad for morale among troops and at home.

Speaker 2:          02:16:30       Now, does that make sense to you? I don't know enough about what it's like to motivate young men to go to battle. I don't know enough about what it's like to be a general or a person in power when I'm in a war time situation. I don't know what it's like to be. To have the very existence of my country under threat the way we were in world war two, when that, when those kinds of policies were made, so I don't know, man. I think I'd have think I'd have a very different point of view if I was. That's all and I think we'd all have very different points of view and would do very, very different things and behave maybe a lot like the leaders we criticized if we were under the kinds of responsibilities and pressures that the leaders we talk about we're under.

Speaker 2:          02:17:15       I think that if I were the emir, the caliphate of Baghdad, and I knew that the Mongols were doing what they were doing to people and they were on the way to see me, I'd be pretty ruthless with any kind of dissent, any kind of a Mongol sympathy, and I would be pretty ruthless with anybody who wasn't pitching in for the very survival of my my town because the consequences are so high have not taken seriously, not being aggressively prepared. Yes. The question becomes like how if ever is it possible that because of the fact that we can communicate with each other all across the world instantaneously, how is it possible that we move past the idea of armed conflicts entirely? Like isn't it possible? It is possible and it's already kind of happening? How is it? How can you say that when we're going to war?

Speaker 2:          02:18:05       I mean we're. We're in the middle of like pulling out of Iraq and Afghanistan while maintaining thousands of troops. Yes, we have bases all over the world. Yes, there's this isis shit that's going on. There's this overall, if you look at the number of violent deaths from 2000 until 2015, according to Steven pinker in his very well researched book called the angels of our better nature essentially said it proves and and makes the case that fewer people have died violently in that span of time. Even with the Congo, even with the Middle East, even with all the things that go on in comparison to any other time of epoch, any other time in history, and it seems that a lot of countries like China, for example, China, yes, rattles sort of Taiwan and things, but China gains a great deal more from being an economic powerhouse. Military Power House just isn't, and I maintain this case with Iran.

Speaker 2:          02:18:59       Iran wants to Gemini, Iran wants control over parts of the Middle East. Iran has a lot of influence with the Shia, the Shia, Sunni schism in the Middle East, et cetera. I think Iran gains a lot more and we could create incentives for Iran and we are trying to at least parts of the government or some people disagree with this. I feel like if you created a situation where Iran saw that there was much more to be gained from joining the Economic Community and playing ball in accordance with its laws is an in getting weapons of mass destructions. They're all scared that those chicks are going to find out they don't have to wear burkas in America. Votes cover your come over on boats and then seek out black dick like a magnet, like a magnet to steal filings. Perhaps they're tired of being suppressed. They want a torque on some dude in a club, maybe no crazy, funky religious outfit on and they can escape.

Speaker 2:          02:19:52       You know why? Because no one knows to fuck. They look like they could just blend right in. Good luck with your passport photo when it's looking through a fucking lit of a garbage can. Like Oscar the grouch and that's who you're fucking passport. It looks like you see your eyeballs. I mean, did they have to take this shit out for their passport? Right? Don't they? Are they allowed to? It's like stealing their soul or something. Right? Well, the minute that a lot of Saudi women go to places like London and quake, guess what comes off immediately? Their headrest, the whole thing, and I was shopping and they dress in sexy outfits and they're just like, yeah, cause see impression man. It's just amazing that you've got countries that in 2015 still make women dressed like they're in star wars. This is not a reason for it.

Speaker 2:          02:20:34       Another reason for it. There was another very logical reason for it. Logical. Well, I'm just saying if you're, if you're, if you're really, if you're, if you're just saying, if you're a religious man and if you are trying to create a productive society, the logic went. If you have women walking around looking all sexy and naked, which was a lot of the Middle East, well if you have that, what happens is we're thinking about fucking not producing year. So you've got to cover your chicks up. Jasmine, if she wanted to get any work done. That's not true though. I kurzweil miracle producers like a model for that. How about that? Hot fruits over. It's so true. Freedom. Freedom. Is that what she looked like? Prince, Princess Leia. Is that a real body? Yeah. Damn. Should've banging body as she did. That was real to those pre, pre sucking.

Speaker 2:          02:21:28       Tuck. God bless her. You know, she didn't have no light pole, couldn't look more board. Um, she was beautiful at the time. Very exotic. Leo steelbrick made older brother remember that shit. I love it. She kissed her brother in Ellipsis tick. Is that true? It had to. He didn't know that it was his sister. That's rude. Your sister comes and gives you a real kiss with a body like that since he got some unit. She's even bother telling you that she's. Did she know at the time that she knows she was? No, no one knew how to do a love scene when you were an actor back in the day. I wasn't an actor. I was never really an actor. I did acting work. I had to. I had to do some serious love scenes. Awkward and weird. I bet man, because I was awkward and weird as it is being in a car with you for six hours trying to Turkey hunt. How about that? Huh? We made time, dude. We did have a good time. We always have. I will always haunt because it's just like white going has nothing to do with killing the animals. For me it's I get to hang with you get to be idiots and laugh.

Speaker 3:          02:22:26       It was like I was saying like, there's not a whole lot of dudes I'd asked to sleep in a tent, you know? Come on man. We're going to go. We're going to go to someplace like I'm calling my tv star famous comedian friend going, come on, we're going to go. We're going to sleep under the stars and Montana, Napa Valley. We're going to go shoot deer and then we're going to eat them over a campfire. You in Turkey hunting was interesting. I can't give it away, but I will say that I killed between zero and 10 birds. That's a good number. You know, the Turkey hunting is very exciting. It's fun, but it. The only issue that I have, and I don't really have an issue with it, but the only thing that I would save, it came to like preference of time that I would spend hunting.

Speaker 3:          02:23:05       I would spend less time, Turkey hunting and more time doing other things because the fact that you can't get anything more than a Turkey. Yeah. You stayed there all day. You shoot this Turkey, you've got one Turkey and that's great. I mean there'll be delicious. I'm sure I haven't cooked it yet. I've got it in the open. I told everybody I killed a Turkey or did you know this is where now I had a picture of it. He put it on his instagram so I'm fine. Um, but it, it's just a Turkey. We tasted some of it. We ate some Turkey and tasted like Turkey. It was good, but the breast tasted identical Turkey. Apparently the legs are like a little tougher and the one that I got was apparently a good one to eat because it was fairly young and those are like more 10 called Jake wasn't a top a jake and um, they just don't.

Speaker 3:          02:23:49       Here's the deal, you know, there's not that much food there, you know, it's like it'll feed a family and then maybe you might have sandwiches the next day. If you shoot a deer, like if you go out and you shoot a deer and you spend those those nights sleeping in the tent in Montana and you're successful, you're kind of come back with 50 or 60 pounds of meat credible. I mean you've got backstraps and loins and Burger and you're making sausage out of it and you got just butchering it. Just portraying it as a bitch. We did it for her, we butchered it and we joked around. We had a great time or that Moose. See if I shoot one of those that moves, I'm going to be eating. That moves forever. One of the greatest pictures I've ever seen that picture and the fade or picture with kettlebells are the two pictures I use in my fantasy violence.

Speaker 3:          02:24:34       Well, this is. Listen this, that, that picture is like what it means to eat animals. That is a moose leg. I don't know how much that way, but it was heavy as 100 pounds. Well over 100 pounds. Well over a hundred pounds. What was the 900 pound Moose? Which isn't even that big. Look at that. My phoner Ben. He shot one that was about 1400 pounds. Was much bigger than mine. It's huge antlers. It was ridiculous, but that moves is going to feed me for a year to come over here. Come on. Okay. Do you have good cuts? Yeah. Well, I'll let me show you how to cook it because it's not easy. It's a different thing. It's different than dear. This gladiator animal that you're eating, like first of all, when you eat the meat, I'm going to have you over come over to the house and you and I will sit down and have a meal together, Cook you a real moose steak.

Speaker 3:          02:25:26       You're going to eat it and I'll bring the one. You're going to be like, Holy Shit, because it makes you. It's almost like a stimulant. There's so much energy in that meat. Listen, I've done that with deer meat. I ate deer meat every day for 10 days. I am telling you, and I'm not hokey. You get, you get it. You get a rush. Like I had an. I had an extra kick in my, in my body. It only makes sense if you look at their body. Their flesh is so healthy, like their tissue is so rich and red and dark. Yeah. Like you're dealing with an extremely healthy animal that is surviving against really hardcore predators. I mean, it's running away from mountain lions and wolves. Like this is existence for a moose. It's wolf packs. If you make it from the time you're a calf to the time you're a full grown moves.

Speaker 3:          02:26:14       Good luck. We never started that picture that I had. We came across one that had been torn apart by wolves. No. Yeah, well we were up there hunting. We came across a moose calf. Wow. When we're, we're, we're actually moose hunting and uh, this thing had been torn apart Europe and wolf country. Oh yeah. Not only was I opened wolf country, I was up in a place where they don't even have a limit on how many wolves you can kill because they're just so many. They want you to kill wolves all day dam. They want you to set up bait. You can do whatever you want. There's such a motherfucker, there's just such a motherfucker and there's, they don't have a handle on them at all. The guy that I lived up there, uh, the state of displays, brother that lives up there, he's neighbor lost a cow to a wolf.

Speaker 3:          02:26:56       Well, when we were, when we were in Napa vow, we were in Napa Valley, the farmers I was talking to, they used to keep emos emos like, which are miniature ostriches and lambs and said the mountain lions wreak havoc. The mountain lion would come in and pull those emails over the fence, the seven foot fence, and they just find feathers on the top of the fence that goes our emo and lambs to just eat the shit out of land where the place where you and I were standing up in. That's where it was. Yeah. The place where you and I were staying, they they've lost all their sheep to mountain lions, mountain lions, this farm that we were at, I mean they had all these cows and shit and they think about you have to survive the winter and a mountain lion and wolves or you'll start hating mountain lions and wolves content.

Speaker 3:          02:27:40       There's a totally different idea that you and I have about them. Like you know, you look at a wolf, you look at it, it's like a dog. They don't. That's not a dog to them. That's a danger of starvation thing, that starvation. It's a dangerous fucking thing. I'm trying to find when you're in the frontier and we'll take care of all your livestock. You and your kids couldn't eat. Yeah, man. Well, it's. It hasn't been. Okay. I found the pictures. It hasn't been that long ago that human beings really had to worry about wolves. That's why those big bad wolf and all those different, you know, those, those legends go on in Europe. That's what we're found. That was probably. We had gotten there probably the night after or they still have like lots of meat on it. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:28:22       And what you didn't expect. What I didn't expect was the hair everywhere. Oh, that's stuff that you see on the ground. And that picture jamie could pull it up. It's on my instance care. Find A, a, um, a, a body of a moose calf. It's from four or five months ago. The, um, the, the legs still has, you know, there's still, they would come back, they're probably going to come back and finish off the rest or they were just full and they were going to go somewhere else and get something else, but they always know where it is. They'll come back. Where was that? That was NBC. Like northern British Columbia. Yeah. Do when you meet people at the airport? Just A, just a random guy at the airport saw that I had a cammo jacket on and asked me if I was hunting to talk to me about how much he likes to kill wolves.

Speaker 1:          02:29:05       These city people, they just don't understand. You know, the, they lived down there in Vancouver and they're making all the laws for up here and you know, we're, we're the ones who have to hear them howl and you know, and wonder how many of them there are out there and they kill your livestock and they kill your dogs and the different perspective. They're wolves. Like the movies, like Little Red Riding Hood. Look out little girl. Don't go off in the woods alone because there's wolves out there too. They're so smart. They know. What's our next Honda we're going to on to know we could pay current. You know what I was thinking? I was thinking we should go go caribou hunting. Oh cool. We'll call Alaska us too cold to going in. You're going in August. I'll go then. Yeah, they migrate in August. Right. What about before that?

Speaker 1:          02:29:54       I don't know. We'll figure someone to kill a pig up. Oh, you're crazy. You're violent. What happened to you? I want to eat a pig. Oh, I need some pig and eat them. I love. I still have some from the pig I shot. You do? Yeah. I'll cook some. At the House I made a ham, like maybe you still have all my hunting gear or your house. Some of you. I made a ham. That's us were Turkey hunting. Look if you look at me, but I made this ham that I a slow, a slow cooked on the smoker for like six, seven hours. I brightened it for like four or five days. Chase Brian it like he'll take ice, put it in a cooler. You take this bronx mostly like salt and sugar and some spices and you dunk this ham in there and then surround everything with ice and put it in like a Yeti cooler and then look at that.

Speaker 1:          02:30:39       Wow. You're getting to be quite the meat cooker. I'm getting good at cooking meat like I've. I'm no chef. I don't have skills. I don't know what I'm doing, but I do know how to smoke me. I knew how to grill steaks. I cooked a written out last night. Yeah, he's like a real chef. Like he could be like a real chef. I tell people he made me beaver. I said some of the best meals I've ever had. Get out of here. Those are some. Those are some ribs that I cooked. I was. You're so funny that you post. I always. I finally went in instagram. Obviously posting meat. That's where cooked last night. Cowboy cut of goodbye. That was when his son that's artwork to me. Is that boosie? No, that's Ribeye steak. Could, that's a regular steak. I got a cowboy cut a big thick.

Speaker 1:          02:31:22       It was probably like maybe three inches thick. At least one to two and a half. Maybe it was a fat thick one where I had to use a thermometer to cook it. So, uh, I cook it on the outside. You see are the outside on these things called Grill grates. I gotta I gotTa show you the smoker I got. It's a yoder. It's, uh, it, it, it uses direct heat as well as indirect heat. You ever seen those things? Those pellet smokers know? Well, this one you can sear it on one side. Then you move it over to the other side and then you just leave the temperature of what you want it. For me it was like 400 degrees, so I dropped it down to 400 degrees and I have a thermometer in it. It's tells me when the temperature, the internal temperature hits like 1:25 and then I watch it carefully.

Speaker 1:          02:32:01       Took it to be about 1:30 in there, pop that bitch out and let it sit for roasting it. You're starting off grilling it. You're starting enough grilling. It's direct fire like fire literally below these greats. Yeah, and you see are the shit out of it. I don't mean the shit out of it. You don't want to burn it, but you want to sear it for. Depending upon the thickness of the meat and the temperature that you're searing it. I don't do it for more than like two and a half minutes aside and I just really just like cooked the outside, you know, you're, you're burning off any possible bacteria that's on the outside. You get a nice crust and a good, like a delicious, like top area of it where it's like real crispy and you got like kosher salt and black pepper and a little bit of garlic powder.

Speaker 1:          02:32:42       I mix on there and I let it sit for like an hour before I put it on the grill. It's an art form to. It magnifies. It is because like I, I put post pictures of it because I like when other people do too, like, like looking at people's instagrams and shit that they're making. My, my father in law can cook the greatest stakes. He put Hughes's hickory chips and he smokes it that way on the. Well he's just a master with a grill. I try to replicate replicated. I just can't do it. There's two different styles of cooking steaks. Like some people like the Argentine style, which is like a slow grill. Slow and low. They'll cook like a steak slowly. I like my meat to be a little raw though. Like rare. No, but I mean they don't. I mean they can certainly still cook it rare.

Speaker 1:          02:33:22       They just cook it at a low temperature. They don't like, like American style grilling a steak, you know, you see that stake hit the thing and you flip it or you move it a little and then you flip it and then you push it off to the side and you always put the lid on it and you let it rest. Like you got to let it sit like you grill the top of it. But unless it's a really thin steak that's not going to really get the center where you want it. It'll be really rare in the center. So what you do is you put it like if you have a, um, like either one of those Weber's or I have a Kamado, you put a top layer lever to it so that the heat is not really underneath and anymore cooking it from the bottom. It's cooking all around it and then you put it on the top, close the lid and it'll drop down like maybe 350 degrees or somewhere around there. And then you cook it slowly for the next, like depending upon the thickness of the steak, I don't usually like to go more than five minutes and then I pull it off of there. So what I've done is I've seen her the shit out of the outside with like really odd flames and a hot grill

Speaker 2:          02:34:18       grate and it's. Everything is just like really cooking. The outside of it would then slow cooking it after that. So you get that. They do it all kinds of stuff. On the outside. I had, I had a big stake in Utah where they, they put it in a plastic bag and they boil it. Oh yeah, yeah. That's a new thing that God damn. It was good. That's the thing that snake river farms is really popular right now. They're, they're, they have new ones that they sell that you put like you put a pot of water, you know, and then you stick this heater element in it and it cooks it for you. You just sit it on the, on the, on the counter, but it's not the sitter on your stove, but it's not the stove that took cooking it. It's this device that you have in the water so it'll keep the water steady.

Speaker 2:          02:35:01       Hundred and 35 degrees, which is like medium, medium rare. So you would just do that and it would cook it perfectly. Like you couldn't fuck it up. It couldn't overcook and then you take it and they cook the outside of it with like a torch. Right. I could take a butane torch and they crispy sear or the outside of it and it's supposed to be amazing. Yeah, I've had it. It's incredible. I don't like that shit though. I had a wagon was sent to me from snake river farms, which apparently like I went to Mastro's and God goes, well, snake river farms is the best dude. I don't know what they do there. I don't know what they do at those cows. I, I'm, I'm just telling you is the best steak. I. It's better than Venice spending anything you might like. Different things that I like because I've, I've tried that Wagyu.

Speaker 2:          02:35:42       I've given a bunch of tries. I've had coby fatty tissue, fatty I liked about this is what I like about like that, that I'm what the fuck tri tip that we had. I like lean to. I'm more of a lean guy. I don't like a lot of fat and this was. This was an exception. Maybe they're just the preparation. The chef just nailed it now because they sent me my own stakes and I just cooked it and fucking butter and I was just still like the best steak I've ever had. Well, I'll give it another shot. I've had it before. I didn't like it. I felt like I was eating. I'll call them the guy. I think I know the guy. I'll have him send you some steaks. I felt like I was eating a bedridden patient. If you took a cow stuff, froot loops, duck fat face and getting drunk every night and then killed it.

Speaker 2:          02:36:22       I'm curious what you think of this snake rivers. Well, I'll try and have it to a size. Apparently there are these day are like, there's, there's other places that do Wagyu and then the snake river farms. Like everybody, everybody who's in the, they all say, well that's, that's the Cadillac. That's the Mercedes Ferrari of snakes. Again, another Japanese invention, those slick bastards. Robin with peer, don't they? And they do all kinds of weird shit with the cow. They don't let it move. Nice. The whole culture, when you think about one small island, just thinking about what they did to revolutionize the car industry, they made cars reliable with insane, with insane, um, cooperation. And I'll give you an example with fully contemplated a plant. This is back in the day. This was 20 years ago in twitter company. They could start from, from when they started with the one piece that was, they were going to put the car together on the assembly line.

Speaker 2:          02:37:11       It took five minutes to assemble an entire Toyota dollars. You take 10 guys, just make sure the bolts are tightened down. What the fuck man, don't rush my car. No bolts on five minutes. That seems like a little quick. Maybe. Slow down. I think so, but they have it down to a science. They always say that Japan was so heavily influenced by one factor, a lot of people in a very small area and it required a great deal of cooperation, but even more importantly because of typhoons, their, their, their architecture was made from rice because you didn't want a wind to blow stone on you and die. So the reason that the origami, like, you know, they have like sliding glass doors and I mean paper, a lot of their, their houses were made if the inside was made of paper. Well the problem with that is when you have walls that separate you, that are made of paper, you can hear what goes on in the room next to you and if you have a couple that's fucking or whatever, or crying or arguing, now you're privy to their business. And what that did was they said, how are we going to run a society like this? This is weird. I mean, I, I, I know he's listening to me and then I'm listening to him and what a lot of social scientists talk about is this idea that the Japanese got super good at actively not hearing things they're not supposed to and it was like this sort of social contract where, first of all, you never mentioned that you heard anything. Second of all, you didn't even gossip because you didn't hear it.

Speaker 4:          02:38:43       Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi.

Speaker 2:          02:38:50       Not Listening. I'm not listening. I am jacking off. I'm not listening. What a bizarre culture that they exhibited so many unique traits and characteristics and at so many unique strengths. You know, I mean if you, if you think about their contributions just to martial arts alone for one island like that, it's unprecedented. I mean, the other island, I mean Brazil is obviously an enormous country and there they had a massive influence on as well. Holland is a small country. They had a massive influence on kickboxing and Muay Thai and on the economy of the world. I mean a lot of, a lot of, a lot of that day they're an economic powerhouse responsible for setting up shop in Africa and and I believe in a place called New York and that's right. If the kit there, I was just there. I was confused. Denmark. Holly Hallmark. The Netherlands is the same as volunteer. Yeah. All of that area. You can fuck up. You're a Dane. You're from Denmark. What does that mean now you. Okay. Are You Dutch? English, history from the Netherlands. You're Dutch. You're here from how I. it's always confusing, but they also figured out we'd and hookers a long time ago. They're great. They figured out a lot of shit. They're like, let's just like how about you just get tested and do whatever you want to do and the only issue with the Japanese is their challenge has always been innovation.

Speaker 1:          02:40:14       Like they're really good at mimicry and making things better, but as far as. And the reason for that is because of the way their society is structured so that if you are someone who comes up with a better way to do something, then your boss, your boss would lose face. And so that's why a lot of things stayed rather stagnant. Even though they were good. It was very hard for them to sort of keep up with the in. So not as much innovation comes out of Japan. They don't really have a silicon valley the way we do. Uh, and that's, uh, that's an interesting way of describing it. If you have a boss and you go out to drink the boss strings, a higher higher caliber whiskey than you do really, cutty Sark and you'll drink something shithead, give up the good booze son. This man, come on Bro, you make more money.

Speaker 1:          02:40:59       He's up. Come on, we work together. Let's be friends here. And also very chauvinistic. But they did some amazing improvements on existing things. Like that's what their unique characteristic, their unique traits, especially when it comes to automobiles, automobile electronics, phonics, like the NSX forced Ferrari and Porsche to change the way they were making cars. Like they came out with this fucking Nsx, I want to say like 91 or 92 was the first NSX and it was basically like a super evolved sports car for the time it like had these ridiculous things that they'd built into it like baffles in the fuel lines to make sure that the weight always stayed completely central. Like they wanted to have like a pure 50 slash 50 weight balance. So it's a mid engine car so the engine is behind the passenger seat. All these unique innovations to the suspension geometry and the way it handled was just like, like it was on rails man.

Speaker 1:          02:42:00       And it was not even a high horsepower car. It was like 275. I think initially maybe two to 90 towards the end of its production line. It wasn't like that speed. It was just bulletproof. Who's all aluminum? No one had ever done that before. No one had ever made an all aluminum sports car. I remember getting in that car with you when you first got it. So amazing and you were just like you were telling me about it. The engineering is unprecedented and they lost money on every one they sold. They didn't make money on that car. Why? That makes a flagship car just to show you, look, not only are we going to make something that's better than any of your shit. It's not going to break down ever. It looks awesome and we're going to lose money selling it. Fuck you. Shut. You shut your mouth. Damn, and they kind of do that with the Nissan does that now with this thing called the GTR.

Speaker 1:          02:42:52       They have this car, that GTR. It's actually more expensive now than it used to be for awhile. It's like they were barely breaking even on it, but I think now they realize that has such a demand that it's. You can kind of charge more money and they've continued to innovate it. They continue to. It's like a Samurai sword. They built the Samurai sword and I want to say the NSX came out like 2007 or something like that. I might be off, but that time they've just made a better version every year. Every year, every year. Every year. That's what it looks like now. Two thousand and 15 cost. That's a hundred and something thousand, but it is a fucking spaceship. Really. I rented one of those when I was in Austin at budget know Hertz. Hertz rent a car will let you run a fucking NSX. Hilarious. So I rented an Nsx and me and the Hinchcliffe machine, we're fucking tooling around. That thing is the fastest fucking thing I've ever done look like. That's what I like about it. It's such a, you know, it's kind of an understated sports car that's not a GTR. What is that? That's got different tale laws. Unless it's got. No, I think it's just unique tail lights. Is that a real one?

Speaker 1:          02:43:58       Maybe the real tail lights or go back to the previous image that you had. That's the real tail lights. They're really cool looking. It's a spaceship man. The way it handles, it's all like the thing that people don't like about it. The people that don't like it, most people love it, but the thing that people are a little perturbed about it. Look at that. That's the answer. That's the Nissan. I kept thinking we were looking at an Acura. I know there's a new ACURA NSX is coming out as well, but it probably won't be, but go back to that image, that rear end image that you just show him. Look at that fucking thing. I mean that might as well be in star wars. Look at the fucking the way it's built and all of that is aerodynamics. Like all that shit you see around the back end, all that shit around the pipes.

Speaker 1:          02:44:36       That's all designed for downforce. Extreme amounts of downtown Florence is super important to me. Well, that's why it has that. Tailoring it in the back of it. That's all about keeping the ass end down because this thing has such fucking insane power that sometimes they can catch a flight. Like there's one of the nerves have that Goddamn, uh, the wing, yes, yes. But still, because of that, sometimes they get back end heavy, which means the front end comes off the ground and they go flying through the air. Yeah, it happened recently at the nurburgring. So Nurburgring look up this gtr crash at nurburgring. It's a crazy thing to watch because you realize this is not just a crash. This is a guy that has no control of his car because the cars wheels aren't touching the ground. It's flying. It's crash. Not Grad. Okay, let go to videos.

Speaker 1:          02:45:27       That's it right there. Bam. Watch this shit. Oh, you motherfucker. Watch this shit. This hurts my, like, my anticipation hurts my adrenal glands. Oh whoa. Whoa, Whoa, whoa. Yep. Look washed out again. He's going around the corner. That's what it kills. So many died man. So he died in this. Yes, they did not hit. Was hit by the car. Look at this shit. He's coming over the hill and it just catches flight. Like he's, he's scraping along the back bumper. Like just skipping through the air. Fucking crazy. The front end came so far off the ground that the car literally was bumper to the ground. Like look at that, the bumpers on the ground to the wind upside down. How fast is he? The wheel actually caught it from going upside down. It goes back forward again and it flips. Oh, he's going ridiculously fast, but that's not what the problem was.

Speaker 1:          02:46:17       The problem was he lost control. I mean it's not about going fast. It's about when do you go fast and when do you slow down and you got to know, look, I'm a circuit. Like the Nurburgring, the Nuremberg ring is the most famous of all circuits when it comes to testing a car's lap time. Like if you can get a really fast lap times the nurburgring, it's worth millions of dollars because that car will be the new king of the Nuremberg ring. The GCR was like, I think one of the best production cars in terms of lap times the fastest for the longest time was a corvette Zr one this fucking insane 650 horsepower corvette. But now the new corvette, z o six is even faster than that. And every year everyone's trying to get a faster lap time on that track. But here's the problem with that track, that track sort of mimics the real world and a sense that it's not like a flat line.

Speaker 1:          02:47:06       It's not like a flat circle, like a nascar thing, but there's ups and downs and twists and turns. When you. You're changing levels, you're going down. It's what you get from a real. It's a real test, the real test of the car's ability in the real world. So that is particularly disturbing because that guy's coming off that hill like that with the kind of power that a real gtr that you could buy in a store has and he's going flying through the air. So you have to stop and think, look how beautiful that is. God, is that where the crash took place? That's the nerve again. Oh my God, look how beautiful it is around it. It's amazing. I've never seen when people stand too close to car races like that with no protection. Other guys who are golf watching golf, when the guy tees off and what are they?

Speaker 1:          02:47:48       Right in the line of fire. You as a good point this, especially though, right? Look how beautiful that is, man. You're flying around next to this unbelievable countryside, so gorgeous parts of Germany and parts of Switzerland and parts of France that are just like that, that blow your mind. Then you go into these little towns and they'd been there for a thousand years. The issue with this racetrack though apparently is that a lot of inclement weather, like you'll watch a bunch of labs, they'll do what's raining out and shit like in the UK, you know, like top gear. One of the hilarious things about top gear, um, is that so often they're testing cars and it's raining. Like Chris Harris I've had on the podcast before is like one of my favorite automotive journalists. So many times he's driving a car and it's raining out really. And these tests. Yeah, she's in the UK. It rains all the fucking time. Think and maybe this is maybe not so, but it's raised card racecar driving more popular in Europe than it is in the United States. That I would say so, yeah. Formula One, they're just like dumb racing nascar. He's got swag man. And swapping bank is why does he have a southern accent is most of the people that will listen to. What if I did it like a contradicting yourself? What if I would accidentally be sophisticated? It looks like the swabbing paint that moment

Speaker 2:          02:49:08       they're going left. I'm Lin love with this. Chevron is gaining ground on him. I tell you, man, it's unbelievable the way he continues to turn left baffles the mind of razor. He's doing a reparable damage to his reputation and to his chassis. How can he do it with such accuracy? The art form outrageous. Now they're fighting. They're. There's a weird culture. The English man, they they. They're also the regal illness and their their way. They have like set up all these different sorts of patterns that they follow. All the rest and behavior of control. Do you play snooker? A madden play snooker of a hooligan will be playing eight ball at the ball, but a gentleman prefers Nuka. Knowing your place, knowing your place, discipline. The British were always very disciplined about protocol. What's to be done, what's not to be done made good soldiers or home until they've figured out Americans figured out.

Speaker 2:          02:50:06       Just shoot it. That white stripe that they're keeping the middle of their chest. That was a long time ago. Domino's was a shit. It ain't gonna work, but it's all the same thing. Yeah. People from their folly, they need to learn what they were wearing wigs and they had wool coats on in the. In the heat. It sucked. Was that about like what was the wig thing and protocol. Powdered wigs. Like why did they have powdered wigs? There was always a form of even the French up until World War One war, you know, lots of like very like feathers and very brightly colored clothing. Peacocks, yeah. As a. As a soldier, you are. You, first of all, you had a uniform and our uniform is going to be much more grandiose. We have more money than you people do. We're. We're a higher birth so our soldiers are decorated with the honor that that is, that is bestowed on the greatest army.

Speaker 2:          02:50:48       There is where a sparkling jewel. All of that. Our sabers are are polished, shiny, shiny, and bright colors. Think about how birds. It's the same thing until Vietnam. Those motherfuckers started heightened and holes in the ground shooting at us and the Brits always just wear khaki. The breads would just fucking down home. Khaki motherfuckers. They were just like, yeah, you guys were all your stuff. We're going to look. Had to wear Khakis. I wonder who figured out hunting like Cammo for hunting. Like who's the first person to invent? He goes back to millennials I think, think so. Fuck leaves and shit. Right? As they were covering themselves and leaves waiting in the cold for dinner. Fuck yeah, they made it. You didn't. You didn't get to this point. Trust me, trust me. You with your fucking ironic glasses on that don't even have a real lens.

Speaker 2:          02:51:38       Like people were like clear glass. Fashion has always been another thing that we. Fashion has always been there fast, but people's appearance. I mean, you know, if you look at indigenous cultures that have had very little contact, they're still putting bones there. Knows I'm wearing feathers and peacocking men and women, but the eyeglass one is one of the weirdest ones. Well, because it's a friend of mine's mother. He couldn't get a job. It wasn't a friend of mine. It's a friend of mine told me this story about this kid. He's Puerto Rican and he couldn't get a job and his mother said he'd been on. He was a great student. He's a great guy. Just couldn't get a job. I was trying to work on Wall Street. His mother went out and bought him a pair of glasses, just clear glasses and he got us. I got every job we went in for.

Speaker 2:          02:52:18       He had glasses on. They went, this guy must read and he got every fucking job. His mother was genius. He said, I'm going to put some glasses on your watch this. It's also the only a candy cap that is sexually arousing 100 percent. Like men, like a secretary looking chick with glasses on. Women like with classes really do though. Yeah. Tell me about it. When you do put glass on style, I have to use my reading glasses sometimes. We resist all the time and my wife went, that's really sexy, just looks old. She likes gray in my beard. Guys, they're dying. Loves old guy. She loves the old men. She loves him. Wrinkly. Dude. Rankles. We're almost out of time. I understand that you're going to be in Sacramento doing your standup comedy this weekend. Brian tells them about it and they're actually expect that the punch line.

Speaker 2:          02:53:00       I'm glad you asked Joe. I'm going to be at the Sacramento punchline tearing it up this Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and I am under the impression I've been talking to Tj dillashaw and your favorite. There's a chance they might come out and see me because they're friends of mine and I couldn't be more excited about that. Yes. Thursday, Friday, Saturday. Joe, and I want to say one more thing I, you know, I've got a podcast called the fighter and the kid heard that it gets one point $5, million downloads a month. That's, that's the rumor and it just to end in the rumors. True. Wow. More importantly, I'm going to be having A. There's a. There was a documentary called Lady Valor and I'm going to be having the navy seal who became a woman, uh, Kristen Beck on our podcast and I am very excited. That is. We're going to keep the camera on him.

Speaker 2:          02:53:43       Jamie. This is a surprise. That's right. Gentlemen, we're going to record it soon. She's just taking the shirt off and you've got, you've got a body looked like a naked silverback is a surprise dude. Oh, sorry buddy. Oh, I love it. Oh, okay. Here we got the surprise coming. You guys. Christmas comes early. Those gentlemen are biggest promoter. Looking at not just the shirt but a cultural phenomenon. This shirt, this master, Ken's 1984 taekwondo national champions shirt from the fighter and the kid, they sold 800 of them in about six minutes, right? They flew off the shelves. Just keep them in stock. They bought new ones. They were gone by the end of the day. They're twice restocked shirt. This motherfucker right here. A cultural phenomenon that is the fighter and the kid. Now, what does that feel? We're running out of time, but that's kind of trippy like to know that you guys like yours or like pet show is taken off.

Speaker 2:          02:54:32       It really is. It really is a good fucking podcast. I appreciate it. And a lot of it has to do with your support and we just try to keep it inspiring and funny and uh, and I, you know, it's, it's one of those things, I think it's chemistry, I'm just doing it and showing up and it's just a, you never expect it to be. You don't, you're not managing success. I just show up and do it. But I think Brendan and I have a great chemistry. It's very unusual. Hilarious. You guys were together too. Yeah, it's, it's a very, very funny chemistry. We crack each other up and try to stay as authentic as we can. That's, that's rare and both really good dudes

Speaker 1:          02:55:04       that comes through in the show. Like I know a lot of people that like on the underground, especially like that guy won me over fucker. Like they listen to a fighter and the kid can't used to them. I'm telling you, like I was telling, I've been telling Dana white this forever. I'm like, the guy, he's a great guy. Like I gotta get to take himself seriously. He's very aware of his faults and he's always working on that to rose. He's so silly. Hilarious Shit. Did you see the instagram? I posted of him wearing that hat. I was like, I can't be friends with him. He kept going all hands on deck, all hands on deck. Everybody like, we don't know that people were playing volleyball with these. He's got his hands on his knees, this giant UFC fighter all hands on deck. That's always fun for everybody else who falls outside trying to figure out what's happening on making.

Speaker 1:          02:55:52       His motto was cauliflower ear. He's so silly. Yeah. He's a funny dude, a fighter and the kid. It's available on itunes. It's hilarious. Podcast. It really is fun and you guys get some great guests and lady valor. That's going to be very interesting. I want to talk to her. I want to have her on. That's a. that's an insane story and I'll ask better questions to you. So what I'll do is I'll just watch you guys fuck it up first. I'll come in. I've been trying to think what to ask her. I'm so excited. Oh yeah. We went Turkey hunting. This podcast is supposed to be about that. We missed it. We also did a podcast last week. Folks, if you want to get it, it's available on itunes. It's just in the car with an iphone. Just Brian and I drive and having fun for like two hours or something.
