Speaker 1:          00:00:07       And we're live. All right, Paul, first of all, welcome. Thank you for coming here. And you are probably one of the most requested people from the Internet that I've ever had. So feel good about that. And I'm honored. And he the first guy ever to wear a mushroom hat. Okay. That's really a hat made out of mushrooms. It's made from this on the do mushroom. Um, it's called families from materials. It grows on birch trees throughout the world. But this is an example of why I think shamanistic Lee plants mushrooms become significant. There's a plurality of benefits. So this mushrooms a fire starter mushroom. It allowed for the portability of fire. There's no doubt that we came from Africa. We migrated north, we discovered something new called winter. Oops. This allowed for the portability of fire. You can hollow this mushroom output embers of a fire inside and carry fire for days.

Speaker 1:          00:00:54       If your clan could not rekindle fire in Europe in the wintertime, you would die. So when you. This has actually made by some ladies in Transylvania. Can I feel that? Yeah. And it's a hard wood. Conk. Oh Wow. But when you soak it in lye water, ashes and water it, the laminate's into this fabric. Oh, let me feel that. It's very soft. It's also called German felt. Wow. It's extremely flammable. So it revolutionized warfare because Don Nepal, iconic napoleonic times, this is the punk that ignited gunpowder. So even the Chinese invented the Chinese invented gunpowder, the Europeans and then had the rifle. So this allowed flint spark guns to ignite the gunpowder. This feels amazing. It is as big a piece. Can you get that? That's a great question. Depending on the size of the conch on beech trees, they're much bigger than birch. These trees just naturally get larger.

Speaker 1:          00:01:50       So the larger, the more fabric you can tear. But this mushroom is made of mycelium and basically what that fabric is a cellular fabric called mycelium. And this is, I have, actually, I have one that caught on fire because someone was smoking a joint near me. And uh, the and the embers of the joint got on my hat to just immediately go up. No, it burns really slowly. So it's a fuse. It's fantastic for delayed explosions as because you can light this thing and beekeepers for hundreds of years used this for smoking the hives of bees because it's um, it's just, we could, we could light it now. I mean the whole thing would, one flick of the bic and this thing will smoke entirely in about 10 minutes and turn nothing. Nothing into white ash. Wow. Your fire alarms may go off though. Yeah, probably. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:02:38       Also with this thing, this larger piece, they would hollow this out, put an ember in there. Would they have. They'll have to blow on the ember as they hiked. Well, you could blow it on a little bit and you cap it and then you can put it in your pocket. The famous iceman that was found on the border of view in Austria, he had this tethered to his right side, which is a position of significance. You know, things that you need, like your knife, you know, and things you want to make sure you have if you're right handed you this on the right side. So there's this one example. We have a thread of knowledge of use of mushrooms that goes over millennia and most of those threads have been frayed or broken in the chain of knowledge, but this is one of the threads that was not broken and it's significant.

Speaker 1:          00:03:17       I think it's we are much more dependent upon mushrooms when we were forest people than we are now seemingly in the cities, but it's coming full circle very quickly. Well, mushrooms are weird in that some of them are incredibly edible and nutritious and other ones will kill you and sometimes they look really similar to each other. Well, this is the mystery of mushrooms and I think it speaks to also Michael Phobia, the fear of mushrooms. R Gordon Wasson first coined that term, but when you think about it in your visual landscape with animals, you see them for months, years in plants, so you have a familiarity factor, but mushrooms that come up and disappeared for five days. Some of them can feed you, some can kill you, some can heal you, some can send to you on a spiritual journey. So to have something so powerful and yet so ephemeral, it's natural for humans to avoid that which they don't understand out of fear because they don't know the difference.

Speaker 1:          00:04:16       But you know, 23 primates consume mushrooms, humans being one of them, and so that speaks to a long ancestral use of mushrooms going back in our primate evolutionary tree for a very, very long time. What, how many species of mushrooms are there? You know that you asked, you asked me that question five years ago, I would've said one point $5 million and now we're up to about $5. Million is being is being estimated. Plant fungi outnumber plants five to 10 to one, and I just speak at Ted and I've gone to these ted conferences, but it's shocking with the smartest brains in the world. Not until just recently did they realize what us mycologists have known for a long time. Thirty percent of the soil mass when you're walking on soil, the 30 percent of the biological carbon is fungal. And the biggest, biggest whoa, whoa, whoa.

Speaker 1:          00:05:11       Say that again. Thirty percent. Thirty percent of soil is fungal mass living and dead of healthy soil, so and this is the biggest repository of carbon in the world in the ground is related to these fungal networks. So there is about eight point three to about 10 million species on the planet about right now, about half of those are fungal species. They outnumber plants up to eight to 1:10 to one by by some estimates, a really nice, interesting metric in one meter of a tree root for every meter of a tree root. There's a kilometer of Mycelium, I think of that three feet versus 2100 feet so that the extensiveness of the mycelial network in our landscapes is vast and it's. It's a, as I call it, Earth's natural internet as it is. These are membranes that are literally sensitive. I think they're sentient. They respond to every footprint that we take on this planet.

Speaker 1:          00:06:15       And as you walk across landscapes, you're breaking wood and that makes new nutrition available. So the competition of fungi to find that new new nutritionist, fierce. And so first to the menu winds. So this is something that we are now understanding how essential they are for preserving biodiversity and for the health of the ecosystems as well as our own personal health. So when you say you think they're sentient, to what degree? I mean and you're not talking about just like silicide and your Mascara. We're kind of intellectually provincial in that we are using language and we've ended terms in order to describe concepts that we're trying to. We're struggling with. So the. Let me describe it this way, that we separated from fungi $650 million years ago. Maybe you did. Dude. I know some people that are probably still will. Basically we, we, we are descendants of fungi.

Speaker 1:          00:07:13       We share a more common ancestry with fungi than we do with any of their kingdom and fungi are closer to animals and the plants. Animals came from fungi. You and I are actually fungal bodies. I'm speaking to basically another fungal body right now. So Joe Rogan, I mean whether you know it or not, you are basically a fungal mass from a cellular point of view under the microscope. A human cells, animal cells. And Fungal cells are very, very similar. We exhale carbon dioxide, inhale oxygen, as do fungus. The fungus does. We separated from fungi. Basically, we chose the route to encapsulate our nutrients in a cellular Osaka stomach, digesting our nutrients within the fungal systems, digest their nutrients externally. They exhale oxygen, inhale carbon dioxide and their network like design allows them to respond to catastrophic. And what I mean by that is that the mycelial networks, they're so dense in the soil and they have literally hundreds of billions of tips.

Speaker 1:          00:08:19       And as these tips are growing out, they tend to be polynucleotide at the tips and it allows them to upregulate new enzymes, acid sequences, et cetera. So if there's a new ecological challenge, new food source, a new toxin or something, these fungal networks are so a great plasticity in being able to code for new sequences from their DNA. So all you need is one of those hundreds of billions of tips to find a new enzyme to break down a toxin or a new food source. And what happens then is that information then is incorporated genetically into the mycelial network and the mycelium then surges because as new food logically and so when it surges named creates a new what's called a sector of Mycelium, we now know there's evidence that the mycelial network then that benefits from that tip exploration and discovery. So these are like massively resilient, adaptive organisms that have a network based design, not dissimilar from that of our neural networks, not dissimilar from the computer internet and more and more that I explore this, the more I'm convinced that we will find network based organisms throughout the cosmos, probably fungal systems and fungal systems ultimately give rise, in our case animals and it's more likely we'll find fungal animal relationships all throughout the universe.

Speaker 1:          00:09:44       Do you think

Speaker 2:          00:09:45       that there's some unknown way that animals are connected in some sort of a similar way as well, that if, if animals came from fungus and fungus has this incredible way of communicating with each other, do you think that there's something like that with the animal kingdom that we haven't discovered?

Speaker 1:          00:10:02       Well, that stimulates my thought into talking about the microbiome, the mycelial landscapes, networks, they don't live by themselves. They select a microbiome of bacteria and other organisms that rest upon the mantle. These fungal networks are the foundation of the food web. Well, similarly, we have a microbiome and it's really interesting that the many of the bacterial diseases that infect fungi also affect us. Our best antibiotics against bacteria come from fungi. Penicillin being the obvious example, but we have found out during sex next gen sequencing, and this has never been published before, that the mycelial mats growing in the very same wood chips in our case that we'd been fermented. We had a thousand fold difference in the relative abundance of Genera of bacteria from the very same wood chips. Two different mushroom species planted on these wood chips and the microbiomes that were created and selected for by the mycelium were vastly different.

Speaker 1:          00:11:09       This really strongly supports the concept is the hypothesis with quickly becoming a theory. I'll explain the difference in a minute, but this really supports the concept that I've long believed that a spouse, that these mycelial networks are there, not just happenstance, they are just creating the habitats and the flora and then ultimately the fauna that are resident within the ecosystem to guarantee the plurality and the biodiversity of the ecosystem by creating the plants that create, that grow up, that feed the animals, the insects to create the debris fields and then feed the mycelium for the benefit of the progeny of the mushrooms out form thereafter. So these are deterministic organisms that are setting the stage for ecological evolution. And you think that they're doing this in a conscious manner. Well, see again, we're victims of our consciousness trying to define what is conscious and what a smart and one of the best arguments I've had, my brother builds a super genius, is far smarter than myself and he was editing one of my books, mycelium running how mushrooms can help save the world. And and he goes, Paul, you cannot say that mycelium is intelligent and that you can't say nature is intelligent. I go, wait, Bill, I respect you, but you didn't realize that how poc of the statement that you're giving me, you're telling me nature is not intelligent and yet you are born of nature. Using the mind to conceive the concept that challenge the idea that nature is not intelligent when you are part of nature. I rest my case. Yeah, that's, that's indefensible. So yeah, so we're. We create language and words to describe concepts.

Speaker 2:          00:12:37       So you feel like your brother was sort of hampered by these predetermined categories that we like to put things into it. You have a word, use that word. The word is very clearly defined in our.

Speaker 1:          00:12:47       Thank you. Thank you. Yes. Language is code and we don't have. We haven't elaborated the code yet to elucidate the concepts that we're trying to articulate. That does not mean that just because you can't prove it's true doesn't mean it hasn't happened. So as our vocabulary increases, you know, as our lexicon of language increases of more robust than I think we can better, better describe, test and prove that these concepts are true, but we are biologically provincial. When we think about how limited we are, we're truly neanderthals with nuclear weapons. I mean this is when you look at the how, how important natural ecosystems are, try to replicate them. They're very, very difficult to replicate due to their complexity, so I think the more that we study nature, most all of us scientists subscribe to the adage that the more we studied the subject, the more we realized we didn't know and the Hubris of us thinking that these things cannot occur, did not occur, will not occur, really speaks to our provincial attitude towards nature.

Speaker 2:          00:13:51       The idea that these fungus fungi are creating their environment and almost they're the architects of this environment. They're establishing the landscape for all these different creatures and lifeforms to live is unbelievably fascinating. The idea that and also that they're connected, right? They're connected in some sort of almost like a neural network and there's, what is that thing in the Pacific northwest, the one fungus group that's essentially the largest living organism on the face of the earth.

Speaker 1:          00:14:23       Yeah. The largest organism in the world so far discovered is a mycelial mat. Twenty 200 acres in size and that's equivalent to about 665 football fields. That's one animal is one man, one mycelial mat. It's a honey mushroom that kills trees. It's an edible mushroom, but think of this. Let me think. So for those listeners out there, if any soil biologist know this well, if you go out and get some nice rich soil, a of it and you analyze, it typically is a million 5 million microbes per gram in that soil. Now the mycelium is growing out. We have five or six skin layers that protect us from infection. The mycelium only has one cell wall on the other side of that cell wall are hundreds of millions of microbes per gram that are trying to consume it. Many of which the mycelium is able to upregulate and constant biomolecular communication with this ecosystem be able to prevent predators from consuming it, thus allowing it to achieve the largest mass of any organism in the world.

Speaker 1:          00:15:25       This is amazing to me because it means that it is constantly in communication with the ecosystem being challenged, accepting alliances, so guilds of microbiomes are being created selected by the mycelium and these guilds and communities then cooperate in order to prevent pathogens, parasites, even competing guilds from coming into that landscape. So the dominance of these fungi are to ensure the ecosystems give lives to their progeny. The rule of natural selection of life is reproduction, so everything steers towards reproduction. So from evolutionary biology point of view, what will that organism do to help survive so he can reproduce and reproduction through creating guilds of communities of the microbiome using the mycelial network as the structural foundation of the food web seems to be the name of the game here. So this honey mushroom, is that what it's called? And that lives in the Pacific northwest. It.

Speaker 1:          00:16:22       How is it killing these trees is a root parasite, so it comes in and kills the trees and I spent a lot of time in the old growth forest and a lot of hiking. I've always been one wondering about meadows and the sub Alpine regions. There's all these subalpine forests and then you come out and it is giant meadows. I suspect that the honey mushroom is a meadow maker. It climaxes these trees. It kills them. They then die and then they grow out prophetically, but then it clears the canopy for the grasses landscape, sap prophetic music. It's growing on dead material, so first is a parasite mushrooms, the mushrooms, the persons. The parasite kills the tree. That's a sacrifice or sap probe as another word for it. It's a decomposer. It breaks down that material, but as it decomposes the wood, 30 percent of wood becomes water, so the mycelium generates water, so water lenses are being created that now you have more sunlight.

Speaker 1:          00:17:21       Grasses then flourish, and so I suspected that these mushrooms are actually meadow makers allowing then the elk and the deer and marmots and whatnot to exist in those grassland environments as a way of rebuilding the nitrogen sources in the soil. So I think these are over great huge time scales. We have to get away from the concept of our lifespan or even 100, 200 years. We need to think in millennial terms over many, many millennia. This is unbelievably fascinating. The idea that they're sort of the architects of their ecosystem. They are the architects of our existence. This is something that there's a really fantastic research that's come out in the past two years. I'm. I'm a science ambassador, flared AAA's, the American Association of Science, so I am a little bit out there, but I'm really happy that I have so much scientific support these days because a lot of the things I've been talking about for 20 years now, well rooted and been proven.

Speaker 1:          00:18:21       One of the things that that has been so fascinating to me, and I'm still wrapping my mind around this, but you know, the universe was created about 13 point 8 billion years ago from the Big Bang. The earth coalesced out of star at us about four point 5 billion. The earliest records of life we have is about three point 8 billion years ago. Single cell, single celled organisms, but just recently in lava beds in South Africa, they found mycelium infused to the lava. Two point 4 billion years ago now, we split from fungi, 650 million years ago, and then in Brazil this past year, they found a fully intact, apparently a fossilized mushroom published in nature, which is a very reputable scientific journal, and that one is one point 4 billion years old. So the oldest, multicellular organism in the fossil record today is this fungus in lava in South Africa. Two point 4 billion years ago, a fully formed mushroom who had this form grew, was growing.

Speaker 1:          00:19:29       One point 4 billion years ago, we were. We separated from fungi. Six hundred 50 million years ago. Mushrooms had their form longer than we've had our form by more than a billion years here. Jamie just pulled it up on the screen here so we can take a look at it. One from Brazil. So this is the pause. This though, the image that you're familiar with, the one that has just been published in the past, they have a great name that's a tongue twister to pronounce this Gondwana. Garris ids magnificence. Why did they do that? They do that to make people like me feel stupid. They don't have to graduate students want to publish papers and said they get invent names, so it looks better if you have a long Latin sounding name, so, but think of that. Mushrooms had their form before we had ours. These are elders, these are ancient organisms.

Speaker 1:          00:20:19       These are the really the the overlord under lords of our ecosystem and I suspect and as these neural networks, they have more neural connections in the mycelial mass over a thousand acres and we have in our brain, they are actually accumulating knowledge, genetic intelligence, but I think that as time goes on, I hope that we have to interface with them because I think there is a. There are many benefits of us communicating with mycelium that can give us rapid responses to kind of Straw. That's how they've evolved and we're now the biggest walking catastrophe that I know walking across the planet and we need to engage these fungal allies for the benefits that we need to put it into play in order to prevent the loss of biodiversity.

Speaker 2:          00:21:04       It seems like a communication gap would be very hard to bridge that communication gap. I mean, if we really did find a way to communicate in some form with mushrooms, like the concept of language, like you were talking about, just the idea of nature and intelligence and these words that we have, that we have these sort of concrete definitions in our head that don't really apply to some things that are very, very confusing to us. Like the idea of fungal intelligence, the idea that you could somehow or another understand the language that these things we want. We don't even understand dolphin language.

Speaker 1:          00:21:42       Well, one classic example, example, the Japanese are so clever at this. They, there was a slime mold called Pfizer polycephalum and they had a. and this slime mold is very, very good at navigating through mazes and challenges. I mean, first to food wins is conservation of energy as rewarded. So you don't want to set this up. They like it. They did several experiments. Fun. Most fun. One is they, they designed a nutrient basically nutrient like maze replicating, um, Tokyo and the Japanese subway system. And so they started with Tokyo and they put oats, which is a nutritional source. They inoculated what is on this basic and aggre map with all the major cities, the nodes around Tokyo, and they then make each of those nodes had a piece of oat on them was a source of nutrition. The main oat was where Tokyo was. They inoculated it and then they let the slime mold then grow, and first it grew out randomly exploratory Lee, just like you would do if you're a hunter or something or hunting on the landscape, looking for things, and then after about 28 hours, it reorganized itself in the most efficient way possible and reorganized the Japanese subway system in a more efficient manner than it's designed today.

Speaker 1:          00:23:14       Thus they said, not me, not Paul stamets. This is a demonstration of cellular intelligence. So this is the tip of the proverbial mycelial iceberg. You know, this is, it has broad implications and I just want people to suspend their disbelief and this goes into it actually, the evolution of human consciousness and Terence Mckenna was a good friend of mine. I love Terence. I especially love the last five years of his life because he made fun of himself so much. Terence people took terence way too seriously in many levels, but as his brother Dennis, which I think has been on your show a couple times. Yeah, this is a great ally, great scientists, but you know, Dennis said even if 10 percent of what terence said was true is frigging amazing and terence and Dennis both came up with a stain stoned ape theory. Now it's not a theory, it's a hypothesis.

Speaker 1:          00:24:08       A hypothesis is speculative, but cannot necessarily be as not yet proven. A theory is a hypothesis that has been tested and proven with facts, so I disagree with them and saying it's not a theory, it's a hypothesis, but the hypothesis of the stone, a part of the stoned ape, which I think you've alluded to before, is that with climate change and as the savannas increased and our primate ancestors came out of the forest canopies, there are tracking across the Savanna and if you're a hunter, what do you look? You look for footsteps. I mean, look for Scott and the most significant fleshy mushroom going out of poop in Africa, hippopotamus, elephant, deer, antelope, et cetera. His last big events, this is a very large mushroom. You're hungry, you're with your clan, you consume it, and then 20 minutes later you are catapulted in this extraordinary experience.

Speaker 1:          00:25:06       Psilocybin substitutes, as serotonin becomes a better neurotransmitter, activates neurogenesis, it causes new neurons to form new pathways of knowledge. So that's the stoned ape hypothesis, and it speaks to a mystery that the human brain, basically the brain cavity doubled in size in about 2 million years. Some people say as less as to less than 200,000, Homo sapiens run 200,000 years. Homo sapiens arrived at 200,000 to 300,000 years ago. It's a big gap. It's a big gamble, but science is like that. So you want to be scientifically accurate. Here, I need to show the extreme margins of what's been estimated, so we accept 2 million years that the innocent shown in the fossil record. This is true, the oldest homo sapiens fossils are 300,000 years old now, but we have a subtle suddenly doubling of the human brain. And with that, our language centers increased our ability to prognosticate, to plan, and there's no explanation for this currently.

Speaker 1:          00:26:12       And even though we may not be able to prove it, I ask people to suspend their disbelief for a second. Now, think of this. Our primate ancestors are going across the Savanna, the injustice mushrooms as a clan, massive input for anyone's eaten. These mushrooms, huge amounts of data's coming in, fractal patterns. Geometrical landscapes occur. You have empathy, you have greater courage. You're fighting a saber, save a saber, tooth tiger, you know, one day you have a fear of it. We know now from neurogenesis and the extinction of the fear response that has been clinically proven. PSILOCYBIN allows you to re set and have different neurological pathways to respond to fear, overcoming the fear, conditioned response, potentially ptsd. And there's a lot of research on this currently so, but this one happened one time with one hominid group. Wouldn't happen two times, 10 times it happened, millions and millions and millions and millions of times over millions and millions of years.

Speaker 1:          00:27:17       This leads to what I think is called, should be called epigenetic neurogenesis. We know that there was a regeneration of neurons. We know that psilocybin substitutes as Serotonin, it opens the floodgates of the senses. You have a lot more data coming in and we know that he has extinction of the fear response, so if you're the leader of your clan, you've had this traumatic event, either war or cataclysm from earthquakes, whatever the case may be, or encounter a saber, tooth tiger, whatever. If you're the leader of that clan and you can overcome your fear response, you have courage and you have empathy. Those are leadership skills. I think we'd be able to take note of it. People like to fall leaders who are courageous and yet kind who they can trust, they'll have their best interests in mind. So I think this propelled, I think as a lot is a very good explanation.

Speaker 1:          00:28:10       It's an unprovable hypothesis, but now we're at a junction for the net and we're ready for the next quantum leap in human consciousness. I think psilocybin should be looked upon as a nootropic vitamin and there's a huge amount of interest in this. Johns Hopkins University, as you probably well know, New York University, Ucla, elsewhere in Europe, there's major clinical studies that have been conducted in the past two years showing exactly what I'm saying about overcoming fear response, neurogenesis, overcoming ptsd. This is now medically quite seriously considered and something that I think that we should explore under controlled settings. I'm not into partying with psilocybin mushrooms, so good. I can understand that fear is going to be here in an hour and a half and he's the creator of shroom fest. He's going to be very upset with your idea that you shouldn't party with it. Well, I think there's greater benefit and humanity.

Speaker 1:          00:29:12       I think these are serious tools. California has it. I'm sure you probably aware. Wow. There it's up for legalization. Yeah. I was really quite surprised by that. Yeah. All my work and to put some caveats here, I was. All my work is covered by a drug enforcement administration license. I've published now four new species in the genus philosophy, including the most potent psilocybin mushroom in the world called philosophy as residents, and to be clear, folks, nature provides. I don't, so I had my dea license, I mean everyone I suspected was a dea agent who came to me and wanted to get some psilocybin but probably got set up a bunch of times, numerous times at all. It was, it, was it a point. It was pretty funny. You know, I had this one person that offered me just huge amounts of money and I played with them and I said, no, it's not enough.

Speaker 1:          00:30:01       And he offered me more and more money presented with 200, $300,000 and he and he was writing all these coded letters. Really obviously a dea agent trying to set me up and finally got really frustrated because I was playing with a guy. I said, you know, I'm tired of being set up like this. I'm just gonna play with a Sucker, you know? And so it finally came to a point and you've got really, really frustrated. You don't get mad at me. He goes, well, how much money I go, there's not enough money on this planet for me to ever give you a soulless Ivan mushroom. So give it up. So. But if you say that's not enough money, could that be taken as a negotiation? Well, not enough money on the planet. I suppose. Some aliens, not enough money on the planet for not enough money.

Speaker 1:          00:30:45       It was not enough money. Right before that goes, is telling you that like if you had like a really loosely interpreting judge you I suppose. But I never committed a criminal act. So isn't it sort of like a conspiracy to. I'm not a lawyer. I wouldn't have. I mean you have to keep things in context. I wouldn't play. Maybe you're more courageous person when it comes to that stuff than me. Well at some point I just got frankly pissed off and I'm playing with waste of your time. I'm going to play with you and I'm going to reverse the tables. So. But in any event, this is serious research and it's something that unfortunately, because it can be marginalized by the party atmosphere and used as a party drug. There's a really amazing study that just came out about five days ago. It's a big data study.

Speaker 1:          00:31:35       Four hundred and 40,000 people. Prisoners were surveyed over 10 years and the Department of Human and health services data bank, and they found an amazing correlation if you had in this patient and this prisoners, one experience with psilocybin in your life, one experience it reduced in that population compared to the people who did not take psilocybin mushrooms, an 18 percent reduction in burglary and larceny and up to a 27 percent reduction in other crimes including violent crimes, so that phenomenal. I actually got my numbers reversed, is 27 percent reduction in burglary. Eighteen percent reduction in violent crime. Now, think of the damage not only to the victims and the victims' families, the court system, the lawyers, the collateral damage, people being upset because they were being criminalized in prison for something you know, for merely possessing psilocybin mushrooms or something like that. But think of the return on investment of four to six hour experience creates a lifetime benefit to society. Reducing criminal activity by 18 to 27 percent. This is phenomenal. This is that this is something that can help the health of our, of our human psyche, our of our, of our social system, of reducing trauma throughout our entire society. It's time for us to wake up and look at this at a much more seasoned and intellectual fashion than we have a rational

Speaker 2:          00:33:15       not weighed down by the ideas of mushrooms being a silly thing

Speaker 1:          00:33:19       and so I mean I have a few pet peeves and I understand why people want to use, but the word shroom just drives me crazy. Shroom, fast strand this room fastest with all due respect. I understand, but let's not be children about this. Let's be adults. You know, you're a serious person. I get it. I, I'm also in a non serious person on many levels, but I know when it comes to something that is so powerful that is so important, let's not jeopardize its use medically and the benefit society in the future by appealing to the lowest common denominator. Let's be adults in the room on this.

Speaker 2:          00:33:56       I agree with you to a certain extent, but I also think that it's got to be incredibly frustrating for a guy like you that has the kind of information that you have bouncing around your head in relationship to the rest of the world. Views it. See to a person like myself who I don't know nearly as much as you know, but I know quite a bit more than the average person when it comes to psilocybin and mushrooms or Amanita [inaudible] or Terence Mckenna's ideas. Shroom fest doesn't bother me, but for a serious researcher like yourself, it's got to be like, oh, you're a part of the problem. Right? Well, it's naked. It's silly. Is that Timothy leary problem, right? Right.

Speaker 1:          00:34:31       It held back the bonafide research in this subject for years. There's a movement right now in that, please. It is. There's a movement right now to move psilocybin from schedule one to schedule two, schedule one illegal drug that has no medical benefits. Schedule two means it's a drug that has medical benefits, so there's a serious movement going on right now within the FDA to have it be recategorized because in the words of FDA researchers, I know one arm's length removed is that they've never seen anything with such a strong safety profile. They give so much benefit at so little cost for such a long time. This is a drug in a category of its own. This is really important. Let's not jeopardize it. It is really important, but you're never going to stop kids from calling a truce. Well, you know, and I want to give a pass here.

Speaker 1:          00:35:24       I want to get a pass and the coming of age, you know, when I was 16 to the age 20 to 24, it's the coming of age ceremony. Now I'm going to tell you something that's very deeply personal and very significant in my life. I had a congenital stuttering habit. I could not speak. I could not look at Joe Rogan in the eye right now without, you know, I had like the king's speech. You've seen the movie exactly like that, but worse. In my case, I went through six years of speech therapy. I was interviewed for special education. I grew up in a small town called Columbiana, Ohio and I could not speak now the type of stuttering habit that I have and had. I don't stutter to animals. I had pet snapping turtles and I haven't talked to him all the time and I don't stutter when I sing, but I could not elocute without stuttering constantly and please people out there don't finish a stutterers sentence.

Speaker 1:          00:36:25       The type of stutterer category that I have been in is that we would try to trick our brain with a prepositional or adverbial phrase halfway through the sentence that we're stuck on because we're thinking three or four sentences ahead and the only way you can do is trick the brain. So I had to come up with a new neurological pathway to trick my brain so I could get out of my stuttering rhythm. That was just repetition I couldn't get out of. And then in one day before I ever had psilocybin mushrooms, I bought some, a bag of them and I thought I got, I had no information, I just bought the bag for about 25 bucks and I went out for a walk in the woods in Ohio and there was a beautiful oak tree that I used to climb the top of the very top of the tallest hill in Ohio.

Speaker 1:          00:37:13       We don't have mountains, we have hills and it isn't a summertime. And so I thought set and setting is important. I knew that. So I went for a walk and I ate the bag, the whole bag when I was walking. How many announcers you think? Well, it was about. I know it was about a half an ounce to an ounce. So. So we're, we're talking. This is, this is, this is the elevator ride beyond the 10th floor. So eight to 16 grams is probably on the order, about 20 grand, you know. So. And, but I didn't know. No, I had no one to. So. But I knew that I went to this. I want to. My destination was this tree. So I walked and walked and I came at the tree and I was eating the mushrooms and then I started feeling the effects and so it was great because I was climbing the tree and I was getting higher in the tree and higher in my brain.

Speaker 1:          00:38:01       Well that seems like a terrible thing to do. And I climbed to the top of the tree and this beautiful landscape. But it was, was the summertime, these boiling black clouds in the horizon. I go, oh, that's cool. You know? And so this big summer storm was coming. The, the clouds were dark and boiling and, and they're coming close and I could hear the thunder and you know, and then I'm going to higher and higher and the winds pick up and the tree started moving and I started getting vertigo because I was like, oh my God, I'm getting so freaking high on these mushrooms. And so I grabbed the tree and held on the tree and it became my axis Mundi into the earth. And then the lightning started coming closer and then lightning strikes started. I'm really close and the lightning would hit and I saw fractals for the first time the atmosphere became liquid.

Speaker 1:          00:38:48       I saw this liquid waves of these multidimensional geometrical patterns everywhere and the sparks of lightning would just create these amazing crescendos of secondary, tertiary fractals all around me and I was like, oh my. It was amazing. I said, this is what I read about. So the storm came and lightning strikes are all around me and I was washed with rain ends up there and I felt I felt in touch with Gaia, the universe. My heart opened up. I felt one with all. I was like, oh my gosh, this is such a powerful spiritual experience. I had no idea. No matter what anyone has read, as you probably know it cannot describe the experience, and then it dawned on me, wait a second, stamets, you're in the tallest tree on the tallest hill for miles in the middle of a lightning storm. This is not the best place to be, and so I realized I could be killed up here.

Speaker 1:          00:39:39       Suddenly I had a reality rush, like you could turn into a god. Imagine like Comic Book, Twenty Grams of mushrooms, hugging a tree, the lightning comes and hits you and maybe you were the savior. Maybe you need to get back to that tree. Maybe you're the chosen one. So I thought it was an incredibly spiritual and wonderful experience, but I also had the fear, and this comes, comes with the hero's journey, you know, you always have the dark side. He always have not just the light side, but it's counterbalanced the dark side. Then I realized, oh my gosh, I'm gonna. I could die up here and said, well, I don't die stamets, which were your issues? This, this gets something out of this experience. And I said, this stuttering habits ridiculous and I'm not stupid. So I said to myself, stop stuttering now. Stop Stuttering now. I said that dozens hundreds of times over and over and over, and fortunately the storms went past and held onto the tree and soaking wet.

Speaker 1:          00:40:47       I came out of the tree and walked back to where I was living in the next day I got up, I didn't see anybody and I was walking on on on this path and sidewalk and there's a lady that I really liked a lot, but she was always attracted to the super self assured jocks and things like that. She was actually very kind and sweet, but I didn't want to stare at her in the eyes because I would stutter and it's humiliating for us, so the more humiliating us stutterers feel, the more we stutter and so it's a really slippery slope and so I would avoid eye contact and so for the first time she walked towards him, he says, Good Morning Paul, how are you? She was always so nice to me and I was terrified because embarrass myself, and I looked at her straight in the eyes and I said, I'm doing fine.

Speaker 1:          00:41:36       How are you? And I stopped stuttering in one day and this speaks to now. What has been medically proven is that we can reset the neurology of the human brain through neurogenesis. I believe that experience allowed me to map new neurological pathways that allows me to elocute in a way that I could not elocute before. Now, just to be truthful here, if I drink a lot of alcohol, I'm in a loud bar because us stutterers, you're a martial artist. I've been a martial artist all my life and we have peripheral consciousness and so if someone comes through a door, you know, into the bar and I'm looking at you. I know that they've come through, so this hyper alertness that US martial artists have of knowing things in the circumference around us in the peripheral environment is distracting. So if I drink a lot and there's a loud, a loud noise and a lot of people coming in and out of doors, I'm hypersensitive to intruders and then that's when I'll start stuttering.

Speaker 1:          00:42:36       If the person's talking to me asking me how do you grow mushrooms? It's like filling a well with a teaspoon because I'm worried about the guy who just came through the door over there who looks like he may not be a safe person to be in this environment right now. So that there's a time that I'll, you only give 10 percent of my brain to communicating to the person in front of me. My 90 percent of my brain is hyper aware in the circumstantial environment around me, time for another trip to the tree to cure that last 10 percent.

Speaker 1:          00:43:04       But that's my personal story. That's amazing and it's not going to work. But it worked for you. That's what's important for me. And I was at crater lake lodge and a waiter came up to me and he goes, he's about 17, 18 years of age, a bus boy actually. And my wife and I, my wife looked at me and I looked, looked at her and I said, should I? Yeah, go ahead. So I told her, I told this bus boy at the same story. Now this guy was totally straight, looked like it was a super conservative from a super conservative family. And we told him this whole story and his eyes were wide open because when you meet other stutterers and you talk to them, they're really desperate for a solution. So I never knew what happened to this young bus boy. But I think I changed his life forever.

Speaker 1:          00:43:47       I hope you did. So I had a good friend growing up and his brother was severely stricken with it to the point where he would have to wince, close his eyes and looked down and he would talk to you and he just couldn't get over it. It was. But he won't stutter to animals. It won't stutter when he sings. So what do you think it is? Like what is. What is happening? Do you think that? Well, there's several things. It could be trauma when you're a child combined with neuropathy. I was told by one psychiatrist who is a specialist in this at a conference that there is a theory that in the seventh or eighth month in the womb, you, your neurons failed to make all the connections that it to. So that makes sense to me because why would reroute with preposition preposition or adverbial phrases to try to jump around the little habitual loop that I'm in.

Speaker 1:          00:44:40       But I think this speaks to increasing intelligence and we all will suffer from some form of dementia and neuropathy occurs. There is a really wonderful, safe and legal mushroom to use that at least in neurogenesis and that's called lion's mane. And Lion's mane is a cascading white icicle edible choice mushroom. They sell in the stores, the stores, grocery stores all over. Yeah, lion's Mane. They're called, um, various brand names. One I love is called pom Pom Blanc. It looks like pom poms from cheerleaders and lion's mane contains a unique group of compounds called rna scenes and herbicide nuns. And these regenerate Myelin on the axons of nerves. And so this is a mushroom [inaudible] discovered this in 1994, a Japanese researcher and he postulated it as a potential preventative or treatment for Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy, etc. But do take it. I take it every day, every day, every day. Take it in raw form or I take it in capsules.

Speaker 1:          00:45:49       So you Buy it? Yeah, we have a, we have an extensive product line. How do you get to that host defense.com, host defense.com. Why host defense? And that's part of your innate immunity response, supporting your immunity. But our main business is@fungi.com. And I mentioned that many myself, I'm kind of proud of that. It cost me 25 bucks. Nineteen 94. Wow. You were ahead of the ball so well yourself, but lIon's mane is a safe mushroom to consume. There are several clinical studies out on treating mild cognitive dysfunction, but there's two mouse studies that I think are quite illustrative and this is translational medicine. This translates from mice experiments to humans. We already know is that it has aspects of neurogenesis. When you go into all zimmer, a state of alzheimer's, which is a bit complex, but one of the characteristics is the formation of amyloid plaques.

Speaker 1:          00:46:49       De myelination of the neurons. Myelin transmits the neural signals, demyelination occurs. Your outer sheath on the neurons is interrupted by amyloid plaques that then prevent neurotransmission. So the experiments with the mice, which I think are so interesting was one experiment was the the maze experiment where the mice were put into an arena and they went out of the corridor and they went one way in the corridor or they'd find food the other way. There's no food. Well, very quickly the mice learned, you know, you go out the corridor, go to the left, you find food, they injected it. Then with a toxic polypeptide that induces amyloid plaque formation. That is a neurotoxin. very quickly after two weeks or so, the mice developed neuropathy. They got confused. They couldn't remember which way to go at randomized. Upon giving these mice again, mushrooms for a few weeks, they nearly read, normalized upon sacrificing the mice.

Speaker 1:          00:47:51       And the first part of the experiment, they saw the amyloid plaques and the de myelination. The second part of the experiment, of course, another subset of mice, they found that the myelin regrew and the amyloId plaque had resolved. this is postmortems by say 100 miles. You're basically cutting their brains cutting off a representative sample is sacrifice them. You determine, yeah, that's representative of the population. Now, the remaining population as alive, they fed them the mushrooms and they found that they regained neurological function. The other experiment, which I find is even more fun is, um, and this was done in Japan. They put like 100 mice in an arena and they put a toy in the middle of the cage. All the mice got excited, they came up and sniffed it and smelled it, and they got really excited and they sat there with counters to measure the number of points of contact, how many points of contact the mice have exploring a new toy, so they got a really good baseline, hundreds of data points, and then did the same thing.

Speaker 1:          00:48:53       Then they introduced thiS peptide, this neurotoxin, and the mice. Then after awhile were uninterested, didn't have imagination, no curiosity. They put a new toy. They were disinterested. They did the same thing. Now even their full blown dementia like symptoms gave them lion's mane mushrooms, and after a few weeks where they put it in a new toy, they came back to near normal levels. Upon sacrificing the mice, they found that the amyloid plaque had resolved and myelin had regenerated and neurogenesis had occurred. This is a smart mushroom. Now. The tragedy that we face, I believe as a society is we have people like yourself, people like me, we're all going to suffer through neuropathy. We have a lifetime of a body intellect of knowledge that we're going to start losing. So what is the loss to society of our elders? Forgetting not remembering. So I think this is something that's reallY extraordinarily exciting.

Speaker 1:          00:49:47       It's not patentable, it's the drug companies have no interest in this, but this is probably the number one thing that people can do in my mind to present, to preserve cognitive function, but to expand it now, I personally would love to see it legal, to stack them both together, stacking psilocybin with lion's mane, and I think that stacking thing and then combining it with vitamin d three. Now by suggest vitamin d three niacin because those of you who've had a niacin flush, you know, 200 milligrams of niacin or more, you get red, you get itchy and neuropathy typically is presented at the fingertips at the end of your toes and your fingers and your peripheral nervous system. as you have neuropathy, the nerve endings begin to die backwards, so my idea here is because there are different receptors being activated by psilocybin than with the [inaudible] from lion's mane.

Speaker 1:          00:50:44       If you stack lion's mane with psilocybin mushrooms with niacin. The advantages of this is hypothetical, but this is something I think is well worth testing is that niacin can help drive the neurogenic benefits of psilocybin and aaron means to the end of the peripheral nervous system. So we actually have a planning right now, clinical study in Oregon with lion's mane mushrooms. The physicians who've looked at the research which is robust, are convinced that it adds worthy and they have their own funding. So we're going to have 30 study is what we hope to do, 30 patients and we hope to begin that study in the next year. It was phenomenal to see how that would affect people with cte. People like football players, boxers, people with, uh, across, across the board. The benefits. And this is something that when you're depressed, you're not creative and your immune system is depressed as well. You're psychologically emotionally depressed and you're not as creative when you are happy, you are creative and your immune system is better.

Speaker 1:          00:51:50       So this could be fundamental to disease mitigation across the board. So tHis is some of the. This is, there are so many different examples like this where mushrooms need to be advanced to the front stage of consideration by serious scientists and give up your michael phobia or even your silo phobia, the irrational fear of psilocybin mushrooms and look upon these with new eyes and drop your prejudices and just look at as a serious scientific analysis. Wow. how is this received? Like in the general scientific community? Is there skepticism? I love my skeptics because unless they're prejudice against you, some people are. You can never convince them, but if scientists, when they see the data sets and they see there's a dozen or more publications with scientists without commercial interests who've done this independently, then it's being taken very seriously. So though the whole medical community right now, you know, I speak at a number of medical conferences at ted med, the american academy of dermatology, of the keynote speakers.

Speaker 1:          00:53:00       Many medical conferences. And, and it's great because I can take people who are totally skeptical and most of them walk out of that room convinced, and why shouldn't we think that fungi are sources of medicines. I mean, penicillin may have tipped World war ii in our favor. So the job, the japanese and germans did not have panelists penicillin, even though Alexander Fleming discovered it in 1928 in 1941, a lab tech researcher went to a market in chicago, found a moldy cantaloupe, and alexander fleming's strain of penicillin was too weak. It couldn't be commercialized. This lady researcher who found this moldy cantaloupe found a penicillium strain that was 200 times more potent. And as a result of that, in war, the most of the casualties died from infections. And so the british and the english, the english and the americans had penicillin. The germans and japanese did not. And so it is. There's a great npr analysis on this, on the history of penicillin, and it is one of the major factors in helping tilt the balance in the favor of the allied powers against the axis powers so concerned with the researchers in england. They impregnated their clothes with spores of this mold strain. So if our laboratories were bombed or they were captured, if one of them escaped, they could regenerate the culture from their clothing.

Speaker 2:          00:54:37       Whoa.

Speaker 1:          00:54:40       Wow. And this speaks to the panspermia. We're all carrying microbiomes of fungi. The fact that you and I are here together means that I have now inoculated you with my microbiome of selected fungi. So joe, you are now a vector.

Speaker 2:          00:54:56       Whoa, awesome. Congratulations. Now does the frustrating aspects of. What is the word that you use? Fungi phobiA. So we used by co phobia, michael phobia. The frustrating aspects are first of all, prohibition, right? Sweeping psychedelic act of 1970 that made psilocybin mushrooms illegal. Right? And then on top of it, the commercial pharmaceutical industry, which doesn't want to have anything to do with anything that it can't patent and has so many doctors and so many researchers in its pocket. So you have two issues there, right? You have one issue that people, which is obviously why you don't like the word shroom. People think of mushrooms as a party drug of like being silly, freaking out, doing something stupid, regrettable actions. And then afterwards going, wow, we got so crazy. I was thinking of it as a frivolous sort of thing that you would engage in. Whereas what you're trying to do is show the absolute hard science. Do you feel that this absolute hard science is. I mean, you must feel that it's unfairly inhibited and hindered.

Speaker 1:          00:56:14       The sun has been, but there's never been a title change. Uh, and um, pharma ecology of the use psilocybin and um, and its utility as a therapeutic agent is there's a title change. I think now there's over 700 patients have gone through johns hopkins clinical trials for things like end of life, add depression, ptsd. There's studies out on treating alcoholics. And drug addicts, so and this is important to communicate to people. In John Hopkins study in particular, dr roland griffiths, a great, great scientist. He's been running and championing these studies, came up with a very interesting series of analyses and some of the take home points were only 70 percent of the people described the psilocybin experience therapeutically under controlled settings at John Hopkins with a very high dose of psilocybin as being beneficial. Only 70 percent, 70 percent. Thirty percent of them saying, I didn't like that, but in a retrospective study, 14 months to two years later, the 70 percent of the people who said it was a beneficial experience, still described it as one of the most significant beneficial experiences of their lifetime and interviewing their friends, their spouses.

Speaker 1:          00:57:36       They saw a permanent residual effect from the benefits of the experience. There were nicer people. They're nicer to get along. They're less prone to anger. They had many of values that we would cherish as an improved community of individuals. The 30 percent of the people who had a negative experience, the negativity of the experience did not extend Beyond the experience themselves, so they didn't have collateral damage where we had collateral benefit, so the positive people saw that as a positive experience and the memory of the experience. This is so cool. The memory of the experience kept them optimistic, hopeful, and they felt benefits from just remembering the experience that people had a negative experience. They just wouldn't do that again. So these mushrooms are obviously not for everyone, but for the people who do benefit, they benefit substantially. Don't you feel

Speaker 2:          00:58:31       a lot of the people that have those negative experiences, at least from my understanding, a lot of it are people that have some serious issues that they're not dealing with and ego problems and the mushrooms expose that and they tried to wrestle the mushroom. I mean when.

Speaker 1:          00:58:47       Absolutely. I think the very well put. I think that's a big issue. Some people are afraid of their inner self. They know we're all. He can't paint the canvas, black and white. We're a big spectrum of complex personality traits and what happens to somebody when they're two years old, five years old, what trauma they experience, you know, it's very complex to be able to make the savings, but I think as a, as a group, there are some people who are on the edge and they may not control their innermost emotions and they're afraid of that in normal state of consciousness. So they're Afraid they might lose their control.

Speaker 2:          00:59:26       Right? Yeah. I mean I've, I've had personally some terrIfying psychedelic experiences, but the way I've gotten through them is just to give in, just to give in and for a person like myself was kind of a control freak, especially when I was younger. It's a hard thing to do to use because you're like, no, no, no, I'm going to be fine. No, no, no, no. Fuck this. You know, I'm going to know that I don't like where this is going. I'm going to stop this right now. I'm going to put a halt to this. I bring myself back to sobriety like it's impossible. It's not going to happen. So you have to figure out how to just let go and how to just really let go and trust the mushroom or the dmt or whatever it is that you're on to take you on this ride and you'll be okay when it's over. And if you can't do that, that's the bad trIp. And I've seen a lot of people have bad trips.

Speaker 1:          01:00:09       We'll say close friends. We. We are the casualty of the fact that we don't have an infrastructure tradition in our societies like first peoples and native americans too. They have set up a structure. They have a tradition shamanically your mind, traditions, rituals, elders. They have done this for a long time. I have set and setting down. They know how to treat these powerful medicines in the right context and we lack that. You did, you know that mushrooms were specifically banned from beer in the bavarian beer act of 15, 16, whoa. And mushrooms and hen bane and other plants were used in meads psychoactive beers and celebrated by people practicing pagan religions in europe, in the forest. And the struggle between, I believe christianity, monotheism versus polytheism and nature based religions. There was a collision course and then under pressure of the church, they banned the addition of these plants that could be your gateway to god because the church wanted to be in between you and god. They wanted to get the tIthings. They wanted to be your portal and control, access to the divine, and so these mushrooms are looked upon as being specifically a threat to monotheism and christianity. So the the very end beer act banned mushrooms.

Speaker 2:          01:01:33       That's incredible. Terence had some pretty interesting ideas about that. Terence mckenna did one of the things that he said that he believed that as the climate changed and some mushrooms became less and less available, they started preserving them in honey because you can preserve things in honey and that in preserving things in honey, you also run into the possibility of fermented honey and then fermented honey becoming mead. You go into more of an alcohol culture than a psychedelic culture, which is really like on the opposite end of the spectrum. Alcohol culture is loosened inhibitions, wild behavior, less thought of the consequences of your actions, less introspective, thinking much more chaos, right, and that he believes that this has probably resulted in some sort of a shift he believed rather before he passed, that was resulted in some sort of a shift from these more communal mushroom worshiping cultures to what you saw like in the inquisition and some of the more chaotic times in history.

Speaker 1:          01:02:36       I would respectfully disagree with the secoNd part of that analysis, not what you're saying, but what terence would have been saying. Mushroom being preserved in honey as a way of preventing them from rotting. Do with mead. Well you did. I think it did have something to do with me, but the amount of alcohol being produced versus the dose that you would get. It seemed to me this all simon dose Will be so much more powerful than the small amount of alcohol you'd be trying.

Speaker 2:          01:03:01       Am I misrepresenting what he was saYing?

Speaker 1:          01:03:03       No, I don't think so. I think you're. You're, you have. You just disagree with his initial idea and that's, that's okay. You know, terence isn't terence is, it was a very smart guy and I still appreciate and love him wandering thoughts and they were amazing, but his time timewave zero was totally bs, so that was crazy. That was crazy. He had the end of time occurring on his birthday. I go, don't you think that's a little egocentric?

Speaker 2:          01:03:24       No. Well, he also had some strange sort of a computer program and I've tried to follow it many, many times. Some of the lectures that he gave on that computer program that represented timewave zero, the idea was for people interested, he just thought there was going to come a point of ultimate novelty and somehow or another conveniently he had that point coinciding with both his birthday and the end of the mayan calendar. Right? Yeah. Yeah. His birthday was december 20, first 2012 as well.

Speaker 1:          01:03:52       I think so. Yeah. But the other thing to celebrate totally egotistical, I, I loved him, but he basically got the math to conform to the convenience of his birthday. So it's like

Speaker 2:          01:04:06       whatever. We're all guilty of being human. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean even the great ones. Yeah. I mean, and he was a great, he was one of my favorite people in terms of like listening to his recordings. Do you ever listen to psychedelic salon? Oh yeah. Amazing.

Speaker 1:          01:04:18       One of the best articulators of the english language I've ever.

Speaker 2:          01:04:21       Yes. So yeah, I agree. And as is his brother. Yeah. Every time is how, which what brings me back to the stoned ape theory. One of the things that his brother talked about, and maybe you could elaborate on this, was the impact that psilocybin has on the creation of language and he thinks that the very pathways that you were discussing that psilocybin sort of empowers that, that may very well have been how human beings started elaborating on language.

Speaker 1:          01:04:47       Oh, I think he's correct on that because a glossary leo, um, and we know the neurogenesis occurs in the hippocampus. Gloss eylea is the ability to speak and elocute languages and new words as languaging. Your ability to language is increased under the experience of psilocybin. Speaking to neurogenesis and exactly what we've been talking about, is that basically your hippocampus is your center for learning and memory and is why the mice got better because neurogenesis was occurring in the hippocampus and so they regained their memory and they were able to learn. And so yes, I think this neurogenesis not only occurs in the hippocampus, but I think it can also occur in the peripheral nervous system of an extraordinarily powerful story that I would like to tell about neurogenesis and um, it was from a good friend of mine named bill webb. He lived in big sur California.

Speaker 1:          01:05:46       He was a friend of ansell adams and Henry Miller who wroTe copic tropic of capricorn, whatever it was in the sixties. This is a big part of the movement in the sixties and seventies and antal items is the very famous photographer. And bill webb was a mentor to me. I met him in 20 years of age. I was writing. I wrote my first book, philosophy, mushroom, philosophy, mushrooms, and our allies. You wrote your first book at 20 axiom? I was 18. You bad motherfucker. Yeah. It was the weirdest. I mean, I haven't told anyone this in 30 years, but I went up to a place called Montana books in seattle and I had my manuscript and I walked into the bookstore because I was told Montana books was a kind of an avant garde book publisher in the early 19 seventies. And so I was told to go up there and I made an appointment and then I go in, I'm meeting with a publisher and he goes, listen, this is an interesting little field guide you wrote, but this is not our market.

Speaker 1:          01:06:45       You know, you really need a book representative. You need an agent. And he said, the best agent I know by far is bill webb, you know, but I haven't seen bill webb in two years, but you know, you really need to see bill webb. And when he said those words, the door opened, a little bell rang. And in walked bill webb, he was like, the publisher goes, this is freaking crazy, you know? So building a webinar, I became tightly bonded. He was a father figure to me. He was in his seventies when I met him. So bill and I went down to big sur and we tripped together, was a great mentoring father, son relationship and bill and I became very tight and then bill was about 82 years of age and he calls me up and he says, paul, I have to tell you something that's so important and I want you to listen so you understand paul.

Speaker 1:          01:07:39       I go, yeah, bill, hi, how are you doing? He goes, well, not doing too well. I'm losing my sight. I'm losing my hearing and getting a getting old sucks. He said, but I want to tell you something that's really important. You know, great. bill hasn't tell me to know. Paul, I want you to absolutely swear to me. You will tell this to other people. I go, got it, bill. I said, okay, bill, you've laid. I made the promise. What is it? He goes, okay, I've had this fricking hearing aid and I hate it. I can't hear the birds or the waves breaking on the beach. And that's a big part of the big sur experience live above the cliffs of big sur. And I said, well, what w w, w how this relate? And he goes, well, I did a five gram dose of cubensis.

Speaker 1:          01:08:22       That's the hero's journey for people who are listening. Five grams is, is is it, you know, you're on the floor, and was on his deck and it was house in and he noticed that he dIdn't. his hearing aid, he could hear the birds in the waves and things like that. And he's laying there just. He's like 80, 80, mid eighties at that point. And he's just like having this incredibly blissful experience. He's coming there to reconcile his own mortality. The fact that he's going to die, he's thinking about his life and he's kind of dreaming in that dreamscape. And he hears, click, click, click, click, click, click, click. He looks around and he goes, what's that noise? He shakes his ear. Maybe something is click, click, click, click, click, click, click. He looks around and he decided, he's driving me crazy. I go, where's the sound coming from? And he finally looked over and it was ants walking on the deck by near his head. He could hear their footsteps.

Speaker 1:          01:09:24       Neurogenesis. Jesus christ, and this is an easily measurable metric, silicide and experienced while he was fully on the experience, he said he did not use a hearing aid for three or four days. Now I've mentioned this today, just do mushrooms again and keep the hearing. Well, that's basically he ran out of cubensis and so hearing he was asking me for cubensis and that's. I'm sorry I can't get provided. So I've mentioned this now to several of the clinical researchers who have dea licensed or doing clinical research. This is an easily measurable metric you can do as people were fully, you know, in these sessions they could be giving them auditory stimulation to see if the auditory nerve is undergoing regena neurogenesis and so this is something that I think that can be incorporated in the clinical studies to see if this is true. But bill was emphatic and when bill webb spoke, he had enormous gravitas.

Speaker 1:          01:10:18       This guy was a serious intellectual. So I think this is a end of one study, one individual, but I think this is something that medical researchers did you pay attention to. What do you think could possibly regenerate anything that quickly though, like how could it happen so quickly that during the excited for our trip, because they're like nodes of crossing and there's an interconnectedness that occurs and there's a great graphic which I didn't send you an advance showing this is your brain without psilocybin. This is your brain will whistles simon, and there's a massive amount of neural connections that are occurring. so I think, um, you know, the, just like water chooses the path of least resistance. I think that neurologically, if, if there is a neurological pathway that can help you as a species, as an individual survive, should there be a saber tooth tiger on the horizon, then I think that the economy of energy in nature would reward the neurological pathways that are most likely to lead to your survival.

Speaker 1:          01:11:26       So I think that neurogenesis across the brain occurred just like me with my stuttering and there was another neurological pathway. BuT in bill's case, when he lost his access to those mushrooms, the neuropathy became more resident and prominent. And so what we're looking at these images mean we just put jamie's the best. We're just, we're looking at these images. And could you explain to us what these are? This is your brain on magic mushrooms. Exactly. Opposite of nancy reagan's mantra here. Yeah, this is. You can push this up to your faces. The, the placebos on the left. This is your normal representation of interconnectedness between the nodes of your brain. So I try to explain this to people. most of the people are just listening rather than viewing. Okay. So the, the one on the left, it basically shows the connections between neuronal nodes that maybe on the order of 40 or 50 different nodes of crossing.

Speaker 1:          01:12:30       The one on the right with psilocybin is literally in the hundreds and the nodes of crossing not only are more of them, but the thickness of the lines speaks to how robust those nodes are crossing are for carrying neurological signals. So this is pretty amazing. Now, this also influences, I think is important for our us military, you know, for, for coders, for people who are trying to solve very complex data sets. The ability of you to have increased cognition and increased intelligence, and this is why microdosing is the rage in silicon valley. Enormous number of coders are microdosing right now and for those who are listening, this loose use philosophy cubensis as the standard species because that's the one that's mostly grown and at a half a gram to a quarter gram you have lift off. Five grams is the full blown hero's journey. A lot of people will take between two and four grams as a moderately spiritual experience.

Speaker 1:          01:13:40       Four grams being higher and so microdosing is is taking a dose so low that if at most you might feel it a little bit giddy the first time you take it the first day, but you build up a tolerance immediately. The second day, second day you feel nothing. So that's on the order of a 10th of a gram of cubensis Where people are taking this and then they're taking it repeatedly over time and coders in silicon valley from the biggest computer companies that we all know. This is a not only a fashion but a tool that they are seeing an increased ability for coming up with codes and as a competitive advantage in the capitalistic system.

Speaker 2:          01:14:31       I have a good friend who's a world champion kickboxer and one of the best in the world. He microdose is daily and he's been doing it over the last leg, I want to say probably year or so, and he. He has achieved phenomenal improvements in his performance. Because of that. He says that when he's sparring, it's almost like he's psychic, like he knows what people are going to do before they do it. He said his mood is better. He feels better. He just feels more balanced and he'll take days off and when he takes days off and even though he's completely sober while he's microdosing because he's really only microdosing. There's something about taking days off Where everything just feels like kind of shitty, just doesn't feel good. And then he's like, oh, I didn't. I didn't take my microdose. And so he takes it again and goes right back to that place, but he feels like he's in the matrix.

Speaker 1:          01:15:17       Well, actually it's probably good that he interrupts it because it washes those receptors clean of this all, simon and the time. Do you think you should interrupt for two days out of out of seven, so five days on, two days off. Now I'm not making official recommendations. I'm just saying from from my my small amount of knowledge on the subject, I. I think that makes sense and that's consistent with traditional chinese medicine. It's also consistent for those of us who drink coffee like myself. You drink coffee for five days, you take two days off. That next day is the strongest cup of coffee you've had in a long time.

Speaker 2:          01:15:55       Me and my friends who are just coming to the next podcast after this, we just got done doing sober october. So no alcohol, no marijuana, no nothing. We drank coffee but that's it. And when I stopped smoking marijuana, the first thing that happened is my dreams became rocket charged. Like very biZarre, like crazy, lucid, strange, weird dreams. Not lucid in the sense that controlled them, but lucid in the sense that I realized I was dreaming and I was just like having incredibly vivid, vibrant dreams and I would wake up from them and be certain that what I had done was real. Like I had one dream that I fell Asleep on the couch and why I did fall asleep on the couch. But while I was asleep I was like, oh, I'm struggling to get this blanket over me while I'm on the couch and I'm pulling it, but it's stuck under the cushions and I'm struggling and I kinda halfway got it over me and I went to sleep again. Well, when I woke up in the morning, there was no blanket. There's no blanket anywhere near me. Didn't exist. I had a lucid dream about covering myself with a blanket while I was sleeping on this couch. Very strange and very primal dreams too. Like being chased by wolves and running into bears in and really bizarre, very, very vibrant colors. And, and apparently from what I've read, marijuana does something to suppress rem sleep and that in taking time off of it, your, your rem sleep just gets jacked through the roof.

Speaker 1:          01:17:27       You know, I've heard this many, many times, I've never seen in a clinical study on it, but it's that type of thing. You hear so many times that you have pretty good confidence that this is true.

Speaker 2:          01:17:36       well, we all experienced it. All my friends who did it experienced at ari in particular probably smokes as much as I do, maybe more. I'm he experienced it deeply.

Speaker 1:          01:17:44       I'm glad that you mentioned lucid dreams because this is a nice segue to I think the greatest discovery I've made up my life and I want us all came through a lucid dream. So let me, let me set the stage here. And a colony collapse disorder is a threat to worldwide food, biosecurity, and killing bees. Bees around the world are being decimated. Say the name of the disorder again, colony collapse disorder disorder. Now bees are dying off in enormous quantities. Oklahoma lost 85 percent of his beehives last year or this 2016, 2017. The annual loss of bees report and Maryland lost 75 percent. Nebraska I think lost 60 percent. I met a beekeeper in Washington state who lost 75 percent of his 35,000 hives. Now apex mila for is the honeybee and this factory farm now and the almond harvest in California is the biggest market for beekeepers who send their bees to the almond orchards.

Speaker 1:          01:18:47       One bee component, a thousand flowers and a day, so every flower that bee visits is an almond, so it's one of the most bee dependent crops in the world. Thirty five percent of your food is directly dependent upon bee pollination. The other 65 percent, much of that is indirectly dependent, but hay, alfalfa and clover for cows. All of our dairy is dependent upon bee pollination. All of our berries, all of our nuts, coffee is even cannabis and other non dependent plants benefit from what's called buzz pollination because the bees then can spread the pollen better through the error. It is now a thought by many of the entomologist I've been dealing with, that we could have full colony collapse across the world within 10 years. The cost, it will be astronomical to our society. Prices where food will raise poverty will increase. You could make the argument that increased poverty leads to terrorism because people are poorer, they're desperate, and so colony collapse now is much worse than most people realize because all the wild bees have now been infected.

Speaker 1:          01:20:03       So 80 percent of pollination services come from wild bees and 20 percent from managed honeybees. Eva's [inaudible] is from a honey bee from europe, brought over in the 17 hundreds in 1984. The varroa mite was introduced in the United States and the varroa mite has is like a is a parasite on the backs of bees and injects viruses and particularly the deformed wing virus, the lake sinai virus, and the black queen cell virus. The Deformed wing virus is the really the most important one. Bees used to go and they only live 30 days, but now they used to go pollinating for nine days, so they leave the hive and they pollinate for about nine days. I'd bring back pollen and uh, that's their service to the hive and they die off. Now the average time for pollination is only four days. The order to fight the mites, they've been using a toxic insecticide called emma.

Speaker 1:          01:20:56       EMma tries. Fights is licensed for fighting ticks on cattle using cattle strength doses of ama tries off label. Beekeepers have been drenching their hives with amtrust twice per year. Now the mites have built up tolerance and now they're up to nine times a year. They're soaking the hives in order to kill the mites because mites are injecting these viruses. This is all hands on deck. This is the proverbial shit's gonna hit the fan on. This is an extremely important and interestingly, it's the number one bridge issue between liberals and conservatives. So when you're at thanksgiving dinner or christmas or hanukkah, if you want to avoid talking about trump and politics and hillary or benghazi or whatever that subject, you know, dispute is. Talk about bees. Everyone's on board on protecting the bees. So I had a waking dream first 1984. I had two beehives. I planted a mushroom in my garden called the garden giant and one time this summer I came out to water my mushrooms and it was covered with bees and the bees moved the wood chips aside and I could see these white mycelium and they were sipping on the little droplets of oozing from the mycelium.

Speaker 1:          01:22:07       I got real excited and I kept a journal and for fortY days from dawn to dusk, there was a continuous convoy of bees to my mushroom bed. Does that edible edible mushrooms? Um, and I made note of it. I published it. and then harris smith magazine, 1988. I put it in one of my books in 1994. And then I forgot about it. So I got involved with us biosil biodefense program directly after nine slash 11. You can google my name, stamets and smallpox. There's a vetted press release from the us government. We, we the, the, did 2,200 plus analyses of our mushroom extracts and we found extracts that were highly active against flu viruses against including bird flu against herpes and against pox viruses, including smallpox. So I have a patent that issued on, this is a great secondary story because I had black hawk helicopters coming over my laboratory, all this other stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:23:04       So it's a true conspiracy story. So I had published this research on the antiviral properties of mushrooms, the mycelium, and then I heard about the bees, you know, I'd raised bees and then a friend of mine, louie schwartzberg, we're doing a movie called fantastic fungi making for 10 years. And louie came to me and said, paul, I have eight patents on fungi that can control termites, ants, mosquitoes, you can google right now. Stamets can take down monsanto. There's probably a thousand websites because my patents are disruptive patents, so I can very much control termites. Ants from consuming your house for about twenty cents. And I met with all the big companies but, but anyhow, so louie knew about my research on that. I've spoken on this before and he said, paul, the mites are killing the bees, can't you do something to help the mites? And so now that's two stories.

Speaker 1:          01:24:02       We have this bio shield biodefense story and my antiviral stuff. We have me growing the mushrooms in the garden and a hike in the old growth forest a lot and I'm hiking the old growth for us. And the way I orienteer it'S one of the few skill sets I have. I like just getting off trail and I'm the south fork of the hoh river and I'm deep in the old growth forest. I come around a corner and I see a bear strike. The bear came up, bam, scratched this tree, huge paw strike in the tree. And I told my wife, I said, you know, the Washington state, the school system is dependent upon funding from selling timber to the lumber, lumber companies. So the school system dependent upon timber harvest, off of public lands. So in humans, great wisdom. They decided that the bears were jeopardizing the educational funds in Washington state, so they hired hunters to kill all the bears.

Speaker 1:          01:25:01       So my neighbor killed 400 bears. That's why we have a salmon run right now on [inaudible] inlet, and then chemistry point Washington, there's no bears around because they saw the bears, the threat to the economic stability, this whole system and why the bears when they scratch the trees, it become an entry room for a poly pore mushrooms. So I told my wife, if this is true, let's come back in two years and see if this [inaudible] mushroom is growing there. These are woodcock similar to the one my hat is made from. So we came back two years later and sure enough this wood conk was growing out of the tree. The tree had died, so they kind of got it right. So when bears scratch trees, resin comes out and bees are attracted to the propolis, to make propolis from the residence to pastor hives from cracks, to prevent invaders coming into a beehive.

Speaker 1:          01:25:46       These orals seemingly disparate stories. And this is why this waking dream put it all together. So I have my garden giant in bed with the bees are coming to the [inaudible] biodefense program where I found these extracts are highly active against viruses, bear scratched trees, introduce poly pore mushrooms, and then with my friend louie schwartzberg is saying, you know, how can you help the bees so and now I highly recommend this to everybody. Listening is these lucid dream state at that state when you're fully asleep and you just go into the ether of wakefulness, stay there, reside there. We have random access memory before you get your neurological pathways all set up by habit of what you're going to do. Just exist in that space. And then I had synopsis activate a new neurological pathway. I had an epiphany. I think I know how to save the bees.

Speaker 1:          01:26:43       Fast forward now I have multiple patents issuing all over the world. We've done research for Washington state university. We've gathered two point $5, million dollars. You can go to wsu, www dot b's dot w s u.edu. So the wasn't the university.edu for education. And you'll see the resource that we have. There we are. Now I have found that the extracts of amadou, the one my hat is made from doubles the lifespans of bees and reduces the deformed wing virus by more than a thousand fold in 10 days. I hit joe, the [inaudible] home run. I'm not an entomologist. I have two beehives. I'm not a big beekeeper, but I put these thoughts together that if these mushroom extracts, reduced viruses that harm humans, pigs and birds, what would they do with bees? Now? We all grew up with winnie the pooh, so my us patent issued this past year and now it's issued in Australia, United States issuing in europe, eurasia and Canada.

Speaker 1:          01:27:53       I plan to open source it for the rest of the world, but I was waiting on pins and needles because certainly it would be something called prior art. Patents are issued for and based on several criteria. One, no prior art, no one's ever mentioned it. Secondly, contrary to conventional wisdom, so if you invented the bicycle, the wheel, then you came up with a tricycle. That's not patentable. That's pretty obvious because it's logical. So you want something as. No, no evidence in the literature, public or private or scientific or popular. You want it to contrary to conventional, conventional wisdom, which means that you want experts to teach away from your invention. So every time someone out there and tells me that, that tells, I hear that paul stamets is full of crap. Nothing he says is true. I have one great response. I say, thank you.

Speaker 1:          01:28:44       You're helping my patentability because the more experts that teach away from my invention, the more unconventional my invention is. Hence the more patentable it is. The third criteria is usefulness. Benjamin franklin could not have invented the iphone. There's no usefulness and no self cell towers. So there's three criteria for 17 years. It becomes open source. So the idea is to incentivize inventors. That's why you have the iphone, the droid, all your computers. You know, I had one person call me up in a cell phone and said, how dare you patent this? I go, how dare you speak to me on a cell phone that was enabled by a patent so you could tell me that I shouldn't be patenting things. I'm just like, the contradictions are pretty obvious, so the patents and now have issued and there was no prior art, even though we all grew up with winnie the pooh, we knew that bears went into rotted trees to find honey and beehives.

Speaker 1:          01:29:34       No one apparently until me made the connection that bees are attracted to the mycelium in rotted logs because of immunological benefit. Now, let's go back in time because this is a very big picture concept here. Twelve thousand years ago, we invented agriculture. What did we do? We started to deforest. When we started cutting down the trees, we began to dismantle the immunological mycelial nets of nature. Mycelium needs wood to decompose. You take away the wood. There's mycelium doesn't have a habitat because the mycelium is producing these antiviral compounds, rotting the wood, the bees were attracted, and because of deforestation, now we're stressing the bees. So there's not only the lack of habitat deforestation, there's now neonicotinoids behr and syngenta syngenta that produces neonics as or known a toxic insecticide, um, sponsored research in europe because they didn't believe that new indicative noise harm the bees. There'll be research, the researchers then finally published when they got the results that was contrary to the interests of syngenta and bear that in fact neonicotinoids harm.

Speaker 1:          01:30:41       The second and third generation is now neonicotinoids are now banned in europe. They are not banned in the United States, so you have drift of these new indicative to whites on there, Jason Fields, so you have loss of wood deforestation, you have neonicotinoids, you have gli phosphates, whether they're associated with gmos because they interfere with the microbiome of the bees and their gut flora, so they can't detoxify. It's called the cytochrome p 4:50 pathway that we all have it breaking down toxins. So there's a confluence of multiple stressors, but the nail in the coffin by far is the deformed wing virus and we have found now the extracts of this one drop per thousand drops. One milliliter in a leader can reduce the viruses in bees by more than a thousand fold and double the lifespan. So it's a frigging homerun because it protects food biosecurity around the world at a time that food ecosystems are collapsing.

Speaker 1:          01:31:31       But think of the bigger picture here. For millions of years, we were forest people. We began deforestation. When we got into agriculture, we began to dismantle the immunological networks of nature, the mycelium, this resident, the fact that these same mushrooms that reduce viruses in bees, pigs, birds, people speaks to me of a bigger concept that the mycelium is part of the immunity of the and as we lose the debris fields that the mycelium is dependent upon, we began to dismantle the immunological health of our environment and zoonotic diseases, diseases coming from factory farms, whether they're from pigs or chicken farms. And we have one extraordinary experiment and this speaks to the black hawk helicopter story is that I was working with biosil biodefense program directly after nine slash 11. They contacted me because I wrote an article that was a one page analysis of all the research on the antiviral properties of mushrooms in scientific literature.

Speaker 1:          01:32:38       I wrote this article published in a peer reviewed journal. Bioterrorism became the front and center of concern of the us defense department. A group of radiologists saw my article and they got funded by dick cheney and George Bush and I have, you know, I want to say thank you ironically to those two because they funded the bio shield is called project biodefense and they funded it with several billion dollars and they contacted me because I knew I had this large library of about 700 strains of mushrooms in our culture library. We have a company of 78 great employees and we had this large library, so they said, we want to test your library based on this article that you've written, showing there are antiviral properties in some mushrooms. You have a lot of them. Let's test your library to see if we have antiviral properties. So great. So I started making extracts of mushrooms, the fruit bodies, the mycelium, the little filamentous fuzzy stuff that gives rise to mushrooms and I sent off a hundred extracts at a time all coded with alphanumeric codes.

Speaker 1:          01:33:42       So they didn't. The government didn't know how sending them. So I get the first reports come back and I'm flipping through them. No activity, no activity against pox viruses, because by far the concern was smallpox the biggest. We have no immunological defense against it. Um, after 1974 they stopped immunizing. Do you have a smallpox vaccinaTion on your arm is probably one of the last ones that were getting it. So I'm going through a night, come to sample 78 and it said high activity. Whoa. You know, sample 81 high activity. Whoa. I got really excited. I looked at my notebook, what the codes were, and it was from this mushroom called [inaudible] that grows exclusively in the old growth forests of the pacific northwest. This is the longest living mushroom in north America. It's a perennial poly poor. It looks like a giant beehive by coincidence up on a tree so you can get a picture of jana.

Speaker 1:          01:34:37       And so a garrick on a g, a r I, k o, n and a. So I got real excited and I Was given a contact person because he had one point of contact with us, the defense department, a physician, and I called him up saying, these researchers, these research results are wonderful. He goes, what research results? I go, federal express just delivered me this whole dossier and the first hundred samples, wow, look at that. And, and he goes, you're not supposed to get those. I am. I said, well, I'll photocopy and send them to you. So he didn't think that was too funny, but that's the us government sometimes is not very well organized. The left hand doesn't talk to the right hand. So we got these research results. It's crazy. That looks like a stick up a dude's. But this one is particularly unusual because it was attached to an upper branch. It fell through the air, hit the other branch and teeter tottered and then it regrew it's mycelium and it connected back into the mother. Mycelium inside the tree. And then it grew two legs. So this is like, this was first described by the ice core. It says 65 is ed as [inaudible] ad longum vitam the elixir of long life. So this has been used in greek pharmacopoeia for, for, for thousands of years. So please get back to your store. Sorry for the interruption.

Speaker 1:          01:35:57       It's one aisle. I'm up in Canada. And one of my managers calls me up, says paul, there's a helicopter who are the laboratories? I go, no big deal. And helicopters come and go because no, it's really close. And I said, how close? He goes, listen to go, whoa, that's really close. I go, what are the numbers in the back of the helicopter? And he goes, there are no numbers as a black hawk helicopter. And I went, oh my gosh now just because it was very new in the program with. Because when you have an antidote to a weapon than it can be weaponized by terrorists. So they didn't know who. Not everybody in the government knew who I was. Even though I was working with project biodefense, I was still sort of an unknown entity and I filed a patent application on this. And so I told my manager, okay, shut down the business.

Speaker 1:          01:36:50       Give everybody cultures of this mushroom, which was [inaudible]. I don't want to know who has them shut down the business. Everyone spread. So we decentralized ourselves at target. But hold on, let me stop you right there. So you're in Canada, Canada, and the United States. In Washington state and the helicopters are flying over your lab, what happens then? Well, they were trying. They were spooking us do it on purpose. They were doing the purpose. They were hovering to let you know they're there. I don't know what they were doing. I mean there are treetop level right over the frigging laboratory. So I had everyone go in their car. They asked everyone to go in their car, shut down the business immediately and decentralize us as a target. So later on when I came back, I called the people in the defense department saying, what the hell's going on here?

Speaker 1:          01:37:33       And they go, oh geez, you know, sometimes the left hand doesn't talk to her. Right? Or sorry. So eventually. So how did they find out that you just from your patent filing with the patent? I filed the patent and it disappeared. Most patent applications when you file them show up in the us patent homepage, within a year or two I filed this patent and four or five years later it still had not been published. So I get a hold of my patent attorney who gets ahold of the patent office and the us department of defense considered it to be an act national security, so they quarantined my patent, took it out of the patent office, and they so it could not be seen by potential terrorists because then it could have an antidote to smallpox. So I had to do an inner government, a governmental agency, trace to recall the patent from dod, that meetings they let out to be released because it was a natural product.

Speaker 1:          01:38:29       And so the patent then was put back into the patent application queue and it was approved in 2013. I filed it in 2004. So we have now done work at the university of Mississippi school of pharmacy. We've isolated two novel anti smallpox molecules. We also have done work at the tuberculosis research institute with Dr. Scott France plow and university of Illinois chicago. We've identified a new anti-tuberculosis molecule, a garicoitz and [inaudible] time in greek culture was used for treating consumption later thought to be known as tuberculosis. We have found that extracts of this mushroom are dually active against bacteria and viruses. Most people who die from viral pneumonia actually die from bacterial pneumonia. They get a viral infection. Their immune system over amps and response. You get flood, lungs get flooded with liquid bacteria setup and bacterial pneumonia usually kills people who actually get a flu virus.

Speaker 1:          01:39:27       They die from bacterial pneumonia, so to find a natural product that's dually active against viruses and bacteria is medically significant. So there's a good argument for natural products because you have a consortium of protective agents that are living in this soup of this extract that can help help protect you. So this has now led onto our discovering molecules active against hpv. The human papilloma virus. Seventy percent or more of women have hpv controversial vaccine. Apparently it's very dangerous. Well, I'm not anti vaccination, but I'm not either, but I'm curious why they don't recommend the vaccine after the age of 24. I can't wrap my mind around. I think they're just trying to prevent infection from sexually active kids while you're sexually active after the age of 24. So why? When they're sexually active before then, but if you were didn't have the infection before 24 and you're still active at the age of 24, why wouldn't they recommend the vaccination after the age of 24?

Speaker 1:          01:40:27       Maybe there's a good medical recommended post 24 hours that we were just 24 also post 24. They don't recommend it because they think maybe you already have it. I don't know the answer to that. That's bizarre. I've never been able to get someone to explain to me why is it the case? Mushrooms can suppress the expression of this is that we were saying the ingredients within the mushrooms. We have found five molecules authenticated by nih virology as being potently active against hpv. Which mushrooms, uh, all the poly pores that I have been talking about, a ratio air-con, amadu are likely, we don't, I can't say de facto, all of them to have varying amounts of these constituents. So these mushroom extracts are huge consortium of antiviral and antibacterial compounds. Now, as I mentioned, this maybe 5 million species of fungi is about 150,000 species of mushrooms we've identified around 14,000, so think of from a just from experientials evidence over thousands of years of human experimentation.

Speaker 1:          01:41:34       It'd be like you went into a library and there's 14,000 books in your library, 14,000 species, and our ancestors started selecting each of these species and testing them. We've narrowed the field down to about 200 species of which 50 species are superstars that have no adverse effects to human ingestion that had been used for a very long period of time and within that set of 50 species we're finding these mushrooms which have tremendous potential health benefit. So this is why I'm so excited in the field of mycology is we have translational science. We have applied mycology, and I think based on what we've discovered, we can make the argument that we should save the old growth forest as a matter of national defense. Our fungal genomes are essential for our future and present survival. The more we eliminate these landscapes of biodiversity, the more really losing potential agents that can fight disease, and so this is something that I think we can build a bridge between conservatives and liberals because osama bin ladin and have access to an old growth forest. We did and we do, and I think this is really just indicative of many other things that we can discover if we pay attention to the vast genomic resources we have in the biodiversity of the ecosystems that are, that are still intact.

Speaker 2:          01:43:05       Now. Do you recommend for personal consumpTion any particular mushrooms, any particular supplements?

Speaker 1:          01:43:11       I in terms of recommend recommendations for gourmet mushrooms, I can make those. In terms of recommendations for medicinal mushrooms, I cannot make recommendations. I'm legally tied by the fda. I cannot make a recommendation.

Speaker 2:          01:43:26       Can you recommend a website that perhaps would recommend?

Speaker 1:          01:43:31       Well, I do recommend eating gourmet mushrooms for, for just for a sheet talky, lion's mane, my talky and reishi and chaga,

Speaker 2:          01:43:41       and these all have medical benefits as well. These all,

Speaker 1:          01:43:44       I don't know the difference between a gourmet and a medicinal medicinal mushrooms. Mushrooms, mushrooms are medicinal. Mushrooms are medicinal. Mushrooms are very, very medicinal. The big, the big stars right now by far are reishi, chaga, and lion's mane. What about portabella? They taste too good. They can't be that good for you. Poor bellows, have a problem. I knew all mush. All mushrooms should be cooked and portobellos in particular should be cooked at high temperatures. Why? There is a unfortunate google compound called at garret. Uh, garret teens are hydrazine's that are heat unstable. So the good news is you should cook them. And if you cook them well, then those mushrooms are not a problem. If you don't cook them well, then these hydrazine's are potentially problematic. Now, nature's a numbers game. So there are beneficial compounds that in some balance may outweigh the negative effects of the hydrazine's, the garrett teens in these mushrooms. But that jury is still out. So what are the negative benefits or the negative affects of this? This is an explosive area of conversation and puts my life in danger. So I reserve the right not to answer a question. Whoa. I didn't expect that. It puts your life in danger. Talking about portabella mushrooms.

Speaker 1:          01:45:22       He's looking at me silently. I will respectfully move on. Thank you. So anybody who's interested, just google that and get back to me next. I'm going to have a guy who was the same height as paul and he's going to have a mask on and we're going to have some sort of electric box that distorts his voice. No, but the good news there is lots of mushrooms that have tremendous benefit and compounds inside of portabella mushrooms that are very beneficial and in fact there is a positive study with some breast cancer patients. Breast cancer study showing that that button mushrooms can confer benefits. So there that you know, we. We were funded by nih with a two point $2,000,000 for a breast cancer clinical study on Turkey tail mushrooms and Turkey tail mushrooms are fantastic as adjuncts to conventional therapy. The clinical study that was conducted funded by nih and the university of Minnesota medical school and medical college showed a dose response curve specifically in supporting the immune system by taking Turkey tail mushrooms and the more you talk, the more benefit there was.

Speaker 1:          01:46:37       I have a ted med talk that's very popular in front of 800 physicians where my mother, who is challenged with advanced stage four breast cancer, who is now 90, almost 93 years of age. She had advanced stage four breast cancer when she was 84 years of age, given less than a few months to live, and she had metastasized tumors all over her body. Her breast was erupting with a very, very bad carcinoma and she is alive well and fully recovered today. She did. She had chemotherapy using herceptin and little short time taxol. She had a very bad reaction to taxol, but there's a scientific articles now been published saying that showing that Turkey tail mushroom constituents help conventional therapies like chemotherapy, the herceptin and making herceptin work better. So there's a nice blending of integrative medicine with using natural products with conventional medicine. I will never be say that you should not consult a physician.

Speaker 1:          01:47:42       I will never say that you should not use conventional medicine. You should is the state of the art of science is right there, but the state of the arts and sciences that we can upregulate immunity with these mushrooms and that's your front line of defense and then the other conventional therapies that are being practiced now combine very, very nicely according to many physicians and reports showing that the combination of Turkey tail mushrooms in combination with conventional therapy can have a significant difference in improving your immunological defense. No, I absolutely agree with you that conventional treatments are state of the art and this is state of the art science. When you're talking about dealing with cancer, you should deal with oncologists that are at the cutting edge, but they're not state of the art when it comes to the preventing of these things and that that's a giant issue that a lot of people have when it comes to nutrition, lifestyle, mitigating stress, all the various factors that contribute to a bunch of different health ailments.

Speaker 1:          01:48:45       Do you think that mushrooms could also play a factor in that as well? Absolutely. Absolutely. There's a great epidemiological study that came out of Japan and dr. Valois was a epidemiologist that worked for the national cancer center in tokyo and they noticed and surveying people in Japan in the 19 sixties, early 19 seventies, there was a dearth, a drop in the overall cancer rate and this one population in nagano prefecture in Japan, so he was sent there by the national cancer center of tokyo, by the government to say what are these people doing? And this one cluster of villages where they have statistically significant less cancer rates. We're talking about 30 percent less than the national average. And after exhaustive study he found that they were eating enoki mushrooms. A lot of them, because the enoki mushrooms are really thin ones, like really tall stems.

Speaker 1:          01:49:39       You can buy them in the store. Well, the font, there was a big farming centers for enoki mushrooms there and then the blemished ones as us. Roberta, there's no. We don't sell to the public, the ones that have little spots on them or are deformed, but they are given to the workers and so their workers and then their families eat a higher per capita consumption of enoki mushrooms than the other residents of Japan. So they found that specifically the consumption of enoki mushrooms resulted in a reduction of cancer across the board of all cancers. Statistically significant, I think over 220,000 people in this epidemiological survey. I've written about 10 articles for the huffington post and you can google stamets, huffington post and enoki mushrooms and see all the citations on enoki mushrooms on lion's mane on [inaudible]. All these mushrooms I'm talking about, they're all peer reviewed past physicians. They're all very short articles, but they summarize a lot of the research that I'm talking about.

Speaker 2:          01:50:37       That's amazing. Um, what, what do you know about the quarter eps mushroom?

Speaker 1:          01:50:42       I know a fair amount about cortisol.

Speaker 2:          01:50:44       Yeah. I'm fascinated for two reasons. One, because of a supplement that I take that my company makes called true tech sport, sorry for the name. My apologies in advance, buT it's based on athletic performance, but the shroom tech is based on the quarter steps and be 12 and a bunch of different adaptogens. And the idea being that when you take that it benefits athletic performance, benefits, endurance and oxygen utilization. And apparently they discoVered this from what? It's a weird one because they grow it on, on a caterpillar, d, do you know about all that?

Speaker 1:          01:51:21       Yeah. Cordyceps is now has been split into several different gentlemen. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:51:26       bring up. The other one is the one that explodes on ants.

Speaker 1:          01:51:29       Yeah, there's a. There's a quarter steps. Sinensis now known as [inaudible] sinensis. cordyceps has about 500 species in it. It's been a very complicated taxonomy because when researchers would go in the himalayas and they find these caterpillars for the quarter system mushrooms coming out of it, very good scientists, and they did this. What I would do, they would take it in a laboratory. They would break it open and take a piece of tissue from the inside. They. It's called cloning. So you just capture their genetic material. You grow out the culture. Very confusing because there's five different fungi. They're called anna morphs. Cordyceps is a dimorphic fungus. what that means as two forms, it's got a mold state and it's got a mushroom state. The mushroom state comes up like a little club, looked like your finger would go, orange, orange, little finger coming up out of the ground so you can find that jamie and the.

Speaker 1:          01:52:25       Yeah, so is this a expired caterpillar? I can't actually see the species there, but it looked like they're beetles, so there's a number of core set of species. So when there was a lot of scientific dispute on what the true anamorphic, now it's two sides of the same coin. You see the quarter and then you clone it and you get this mold growing and then people will grow up the mold. Well now we know there are several species of molds that are growing inside the caterpillar, so the true cost us a quarter step sinensis is now identified as her tele condensed sinensis. That's the true one facility on my cs and monetarism and all these other ones are not considered to be the true organism. They're chasing the other quarters steps mold inside of the mushroom. Whoa. Well, I can't keep up with you. This isn't going to be one that I'm going to go over many, many, many, many poly culture, poly call polyculture with several different entimopathogenic fungi.

Speaker 1:          01:53:32       These are fungi that kill insects, so I mean this is very, very disruptive because all of the fda and the labeling and how do you label this or what do you do and who's right and who's wrong and how do you get the labeling to conform with the current taxonomy based on dna research. The good news is based on the best of my knowledge, the several of these companies that are selling these quarter steps, they anam wharfs even though they may not be the true cordyceps sinensis. Those also confer benefits so you can argue in a sense about different species. The problem with this is there's no less than a thousand peer reviewed articles on quarter acep, sinensis and no one or hardly anyone. No one knows what species they were actually growing because if we don't know which, which of these animal wars there were actually growing was this recent information is all very recent.

Speaker 1:          01:54:23       All in the past four or five years, and especially in the past two years, so it's taxonomy is in flux because the dna pcr amplification in the region of dna that they've chosen to amplify there are idiosyncratic to the species. Now that story has changed. Whole genome sequencing is really the only way to go about this where they sequence the entire genome and so there was a lot of elasticity or plasticity in the expression of dna. Now going back, what we've been talking about, this whole interview, epa, genesis, epa, genesis, is the an environmental stimulus has a selective influence on the genomic expression of the individual species yourself and so you up regulate or turn on genes that are otherwise quote unquote asleep. And so what we're seeing now is that epigenetic influences can cause different dna expressions and so what was considered to be conformity of a species in dna types before like 99 percent.

Speaker 1:          01:55:31       And that was thought that, oh, we're the same species. Now we know that's highly inaccurate. So what was accurate a few years ago is considered to be highly inaccurate today. The science is changing very, very rapidly and the regulatory environment cannot catch up, so it doesn't really matter except for the following, and this is I do make a recommendation here, make sure your mushrooms or whatever products you're consuming are certified organic and please don't buy them from China. Anyone who's been to China, I've been to China several times. The amount of massive air pollution there is horrific and the chain of custody as we call it, where are these people are getting their mushrooms because they had mixed oftentimes distributors, mixed suppliers and as a form of quote unquote russian roulette. We've done analyses on chinese sourced mushrooms and they've had up to 2100 parts per million of lead where two or three capsules is toxic.

Speaker 1:          01:56:23       So why would you take a medicinal mushroom that's contaminated with heavy metals and pesticides? You're trying to improve your immune system at the same time. You're sabotaging your immune system, so getting mushrooms from clean environments is critically important. Unfortunately, because the usda organic program they can borrow from the organic programs of China is still say they're certified organic, so you really need to buy us grown certified organic mushrooms that have a clear chain of custody and hopefully one that is from a reputable supplier or scientist and not somebody who's just trying to make money. There's a lot of opportunistic companies right now who are just trying to exploit and ride the bandwagon of the popularity of medicinal mushrooms without really having done their homework or without fully informing the public that their mushrooms are actually coming from China when they are not. What is the strain of cordyceps mushroom that erupts, that infects ants, kills them, sprouts out of them, and then explodes and infects the ants near them and other ants will drag that ant knowing that it's infected deep, deep away into the forest, away from the column just quarter.

Speaker 1:          01:57:30       Lord dei up on the screen there, pulled up. We of course step laurie dei, you lateralis is another one of these zombie movies he'd been saying have been based on cordyceps and next. I was actUally, I was a character in hannibal lecter. You were? Yeah, in the series. I think it's number five and and l I think elvin stamets. Was this anesthesiologist gave your last name? Yeah, use my last name and they just call you paul. Well they do on star trek. I'm a character instructor. They actually call me paul stamets on star trek, but hannibal lecter that series. I let people write me, said, oh my gosh, you're this evil doctor who overdoses his patients with drugs and then puts them in the backyard and then inoculates with mushrooms just like cordyceps mushrooms growing in the backyard. And some of the star trek people called me up in august of 2016.

Speaker 1:          01:58:28       I'm talking to them. They cbs set it up. They have to talk to you. They saw my ted talk and, and they said, paul, we're the writers of the star trek discovery series. We're kind of stuck, you know, we want to talk to you. We saw your ted talk really interested. And I go, wait a second, are you the one who put me in hannibal lecter? It goes, yeah. And I go, well, let's get it right this time, you know. so I said, okay. I said, foolishly, or maybe to my benefit, foolishly, I said, turn on your tape recorder, give me the general idea, let me run with it. And they said, okay, go for it. There's six of them I guess in the conference call. foolishly, I said, I'm a star trek fan, which is not foolish, but I want no money for these ideas.

Speaker 1:          01:59:08       I give you all my intellectual property. I want science fiction to predict science. Fact, the great thing about star trek is the flip phone and the ipad came out and start truck and then it became reality. I said, so you have a unique opportunity here of forming our future. Let's collaborate to create a future that's better for our future generations, by inspiring students and young people to get excited about the science so they can help populate the universities to create the inventions that can help save this planet. That's in jeopardy. And so I ran with the star trek theme and we just saw the last episode last night and astrobiologist paul stamets is using the mycelium spore drive. It is become, I couldn't believe it. We're watching this thing and star trek, the main theme of star trek is based on mycelium and the concepts that I gave them.

Speaker 1:          02:00:01       They've elaborated this six ways to sunday, so they've really taken it misses as some sort of a propulsion system. It's a system. Because in my ted talk, and I've been talking about this a long time about networks, we have the mycelial network, we have the computer internet, we have the neurological network in our brains. And the ordination of dark matter conforms to string theory. So these are three archetypes, the same archetype, the same dimensional structures stacked on top of each other and nature builds upon its prior successes. So networks reward themselves by surviving. And it was from catastrophic. So I said I'm still bound by confidentiality. And there's an incredibly strict confidentiality agreement. I can only state which has been publicly displayed, but the mycelium spore allows through the internet of nature, you might say, to be able to go into hyperspace immediately by tapping into the mycelial archetype.

Speaker 1:          02:01:01       And so astro mycologist stamets now is plugging himself into the mycelial network of the universe and they can jump rather than using their standard hyper drives, which you see them streaming across for hours from one part of the university, the other, they can show up immediately and then then disappear. Is this something that you think could actually be real? One day? I am. Okay. You're gonna. We're pushing the envelope, pushing the envelope on this one, but if you look at the multiverse and I've had a. I've had a one or two in particular multiverse experiences where time and reality has changed in a way that I cannot explain it. So what do you mean it's so incredibly profound that I still cannot wrap my mind around it. And um, these are psilocybin experiences psilocybin experienced. So I think the psilocybin experience might be a one will portal.

Speaker 1:          02:01:59       And now I'm going to sound like terence mckenna vendoring in the to the multiverse. The idea that time can be bent, that there are multiple universes occurring simultaneously in different realities. And I've had one experience in particular that is just unfathomable to me. I don't know how to explain it is okay. I'll give it a shot. You've already blown my mind this 50 times today. This is a very deeply personal experience to me, but I was um, I was going to the evergreen state college. I had the drug enforcement administration license. My brother john went to yale university. He got a graduate scholarship in neurophysiology at the university of Washington. He came out to Washington state and seattle. I was living in olympia, Washington. I had a cabin up in the mountains near darrington, Washington of the summertime for three years. I set chokers. I was a logger.

Speaker 1:          02:03:02       I really believe in the school of hard knocks and the blending of academia with blue collar, hard work. I love chopping wood. I love running a chainsaw. I love hard labor. I think it gives my mind some respite to be able to think. So I'm in this highly academic environment. My brother john, he died unfortunately two years ago, soon. See he got me involved in mushrooms, so I'm going to segue and set the stage here, but I needed another two minutes to set the stage here. So I'm growing up in a small town in Ohio called columbiana. My brother john goes to is going to yale. He comes back one day and it gives me a book that he usually for his class, but he's on break and he said, I am really fascinated and john went to Mexico. Colombia, came back with great stories of eating psilocybin mushrooms and he's my older brother.

Speaker 1:          02:03:49       I just idolized him and his book called older states of consciousness. And so I said, john, can I borrow your book? He said, sure. And he said, but paul and you get back from my break is over and going back to college and this is part of our textbook. So I borrowed his book, altered states of consciousness. I'm just fascinated reading it about all these different ways of expanding your consciousness. I'm 14 years of age and so my best friend Ryan Snyder says, paul, can I borrow your book? We're hanging together all the time, and I go, yeah, but my idea back, so he borrows my book and he doesn't return it a day. SeverAl days, pass a week, pass, two weeks pass. My brother's coming back on break. I said I needed that book ball back. Paul and I go to ryan. I go, ryan, I need my book.

Speaker 1:          02:04:32       I need my book, and ryan kept on avoiding the answering the subject and to finally give me my book, and ryan goes, I can't give it to you, paul. I said, why is my dad burned it? I see your dad burned my brother's book. I go, wtf? I didn't use this phrase back then. I said, oh my god, and I have a shout out to ryan snyder's father because of that event. It stimulated my interest in altered states of consciousness even more so that john goes to yale and it goes to the university of Washington. I have this dea permit. I'm at the evergreen state college. John calls me up and he says, paul, I think I found some psilocybin mushrooms. John said, you're really smart. You've been collecting sloppy cubensis in Colombia and Mexico, but this is much more complicated up here. I said, let me ask you a few questions.

Speaker 1:          02:05:24       I said, okay, john, can you take a spore print? He goes, yes, I go, spores purple, brown, and he goes, yes, they are purple brown. I go, good. John separable, gelatinous pellicle, and he goes, what's that? And I go, well, break the cap. These are growing on wood chips. Break the cap and separate the cap very slowly. Do you see a little skin that's translucent? And he breaks it and goes, yeah, I see that skin. The john the growing in wood chips, and he goes, yes. I go, are they turning bluish? He goes, yes, they're staining really bright blue go, wow. I said, john, how many did you find? He goes, you would not believe it is a huge amount. I said, wait. I said, paul, they're in a very sensitive place. You better come up here right away. So I jumped in my car and I drove up from olympia to seattle about 60, 70 miles.

Speaker 1:          02:06:15       I get to his house and john's there and I go, well, where are we going to say, well we need some grocery bags and let's get on our bikes and let's go down there. I go, why all the secrecy and the promise is, well you'll see. And it was the end of boat street and right at the university of Washington, right off of university avenue. There's boat street and we get there and right across the street as a police substation. So we're there and it was an eruption of this mushroom that had to be 10,000, 30,000 mushrooms, I don't know, is about 50 feet by 30 feet with all been cultured wood chips. There was an eruption that picked up trash and debris that picked up six inches, was solid mushrooms there. Mushrooms everywhere. To this day, never seen so many mushrooms in one concentrated area. So we waited until the police cars went away and were kind of idling there. And then the police cars will go away and from the substation. And we'd start picking mushrooms, picking mushrooms, and we fill up a grocery bag or two and then the other students are walking by, what are you doing? Oh, nothing. You know? And then we eventually got plenty for everybody.

Speaker 1:          02:07:20       So it was like pretty good. Everyone's all hanging out as a little group like at the bus stop, right? We're not really waiting for the bus. Right. We're waiting for the police cars to go away. And then we picked all these mushrooms and so we got about eight or 10 grocery bags full of these mushrooms help as it turned out to be a new species of called philosophy students. See I'm named after him. No species, new species, as in hadn't been discovered with had never been described in the scientific literature and before. So you picked a mushroom that no one knew existed but hadn't been. Hadn't been described scientifically. We had known about it for about three years, but this is a largest eruption. And from that collection became part of the type collection that anchored the species taxonomically. So I think some of the specimens still exist in her barrier around the world because it's the reference standard.

Speaker 1:          02:08:08       So we go back to the house and it's like we gotta dry them, so we lay out newspapers and the whole, the whole newspapers were just covered with mushrooms. And, and so that night we just above four guys from yale, all neurophysiology, all scientists on scientist track them, eat them. And so, I mean, this is not very potent there. One 10th the potency of cubensis. So we made smoothies and uh, oh my gosh, talk about the gag reflex. So we had to make these foods, we have 50 of them in order to have a dose equivalent equivalent to westlaw speak. Vince's would be. So I knew that. So we made these incredibly distasteful Milkshakes and we chugged them, we drank them. And then amazing experience. I bonded with my brother, it was beautiful. And then you're peaking at the experience. You look around and there's like tens of thousands is modular.

Speaker 1:          02:09:07       Like, oh my gosh, all for science. Um, and so I go To bed and I'm laying in bed in full blown experience. And can barely sleep because all the colors are keeping me awake and my mind is racing and then I have a lucid dream and I'm dreaming and I wake up and I go downstairs, I go, I had this crazy dream. What's your dream? And I said, I saw thousands of cattle dead baking in the sun. I said, I think there's going to be a nuclear war, but what could kill all these cattle, you know, at the time, the reagan administration and all that, the tension was really high between the soviet union and United States. And they said, and they were joking with me saying, oh, well, okay, you know, when it's gonna to happen, I go, I know I was in olympia and I needed to rush up to darrington to stay in my cabin because my books are up there. My manuscript was up there. I need to save, save my research. So they laughed and they laughed. They said, well, when's the world going to end? Paul? And I go, well, there's not this weekend. That was like in two days, it's next weekend. So they wrote on the calendar, December 1st, I put it in my book, I think it's 1975, the end of the world that wrote, paul predicts the end of the world. So we forgot about it. Massive rains the next week, huge amounts of snowfall.

Speaker 1:          02:10:38       And then on wednesday, thursday, temperature inversion, and it flipped to 75 to 85 degrees. All the snow started to melt. All the rivers were flooding and my little cabin was right next to this river that would swell from date and have a morning tonight. It go up six feet just from the snow melt. And because we're very close to this volcano and the glaciers as, oh my gosh, I'm gonna lose my manuscript. All my research. I need to get up there, I need to go up there. And so I'm watching the news on news and the roads are being closed. So I had to go through rockport, Washington, the back way in order to get back to my cabin. I get to my cabin and the bank had eroded about 10 feet. I was only about 10, 12 feet away from the, from the river.

Speaker 1:          02:11:16       Now my cabin was on the verge of falling into it, but I thought my manuscript, I got all my books and I rescued all the material, had medical and get out of there because the roads that have been closed and so I had to wait, wait two days, two days and the roads then opened up and I drove out out of the valley and to snohomish valley and I went around the bend and there the son that was a brilliant sunny day, a warm day and there floating in the fields were hundreds and hundreds of dead cattle. How do you explain that? I entered, I think into the multiverse.

Speaker 3:          02:11:55       Oh,

Speaker 2:          02:11:57       now as a scientist, you realize when you say something like that, you open yourself up to ridicule. Do you feel hesitant to communicate these ideas?

Speaker 1:          02:12:05       to a degree, yes, but you know, I'm 62 years of age and you know, at one point I just don't care. I just don't care. You know, this is true. This happened to me and I can push the envelope on these ideas because the credibility of My research as well established. I can save the bees. Do you care whether I have taken silicide mushrooms? If I can save your farm, your family, your country or the world? Billions of dollars and protect biosecurity. I care more. I care more. That's right. So I'm telling you things. I'm not making these up. I just. But just because you can't explain it does not mean it's not true and I think that we need to accept the fact that the reality is not limited to the perception that we have traditionally used. That's a beautiful way to describe it.

Speaker 2:          02:12:52       Let's end with that. That's perfect. Thank you brother paul. Thank you so much. I'm so glad you came here and thank you to all the people that recommended you and turned me onto your work. And can we do this again? I'd love to please. All right. And if people want to research more of your stuff, fungi.com. And what was the other website and host defense.com. Host defense.com. And there's a ton of other information, ted talk

Speaker 1:          02:13:18       and I like youtube.com/paul stamets site and louie schwartzberg a shout out. We have a fantastic fungi.com. Check it out. Louis, now are coming out with a movie that describes much of this stuff. Thank you so much.

Speaker 4:          02:13:32       All right. Thank you brother. Woo. That was awesome.
