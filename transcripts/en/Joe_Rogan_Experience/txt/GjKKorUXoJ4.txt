This is fucking crazy shit, I believe. Yeah, it's fucking crazy, man. Somebody sent me this yesterday while I was eating dinner and I almost had a fucking heart attack of friends and goes out. What I found looking through yearbooks and that's what I was noticing. I was smoking dope then I was no innocent. Then I was smoking dope. I was finger bang and people, you could still be innocent and finger back. Me and my mom at the house. Yeah. Yeah. I was okay. I was okay.

Speaker 1:          03:25          I wasn't crazy. Then I smoked my first refer when I was 15. I banked it from my dad and uh, I had no idea how strong it was and we rolled a joint and me and my friend Josh and this girl that I was dating, we smoke this shit and we smoked way too much for 15 year olds, whatever we were. And we wound up waking up in various parts of the house, like blank, like blink. It's never happened to me before, but like blank. All of a sudden I'd be on the couch, blink. All of a sudden I'd be in front of the frigerator like blink all the time in between the blanks missing. Wow. Just arriving places like waking up in a bedroom with short term memory, not just no short term memory. It's like my tape gets cut like the, the, the events between those two did not exist.

Speaker 1:          04:17          I get so high, I had zero memory so I would, what I would think it was, it was, I got so high that I would say, you know what, I need to just get into the kitchen and maybe get something to eat and maybe it'll calm this down so my brain's spools up that it's got to figure out to remember to get to the kitchen to eat. Cause I'm that high. And then in between, during the walking, I forget everything. So then boom, all of a sudden I wake up and I'm in front of the fridge or I go, what the fuck? And she was doing it to my girlfriend at the time and my friend was doing it. My friend Josh was doing it too. We were all fucking, it was, it scared me off of weed for a long time. Scared me off of weed for a long time.

Speaker 1:          04:54          I didn't smoke weed again for several years after that. The first time the hydro brother don't get that design. It's the second or third time and then you like you're outside. You really start to understand it. You ended up at a bowling alley by the chocolate milk. That's why I went and ate. We had French fries and chocolate milk. Have you ever had that happen where you felt like you woke up and replaces the third? I remember the first two or three years I just smoked, you know like don't get, what are you doing on Friday night? Nothing. My Mom's leaving. Perfect. I'm going to call Joe. Welcome over some weed on it all, bro. My brother found that last time he was going to rat me out. Oh, I fucking with smoking me guard and we'll go in and listen to pink Floyd the wall. I mean that's not even though the wall wasn't even out yet.

Speaker 1:          05:35          We listen to the Beatles, sergeant pepper, but that's it. Like we get together and rolled a joint. In those days. I used to have a glass. You went to East West, his head shop and there was a tube and the head was like a flute with this open, but it had a hole and you're putting a joint in it and you put your finger at the end. Joe Light it and you'd like to join and I stuck it in and I'd hold it back. Then it was like that's, that was your carburetor when you smoked one of those you got, sorry. That's it. And then we'd sit around and we'd all have money, you know, like what do you want to do? How much you got Donald? A quarter. What do you got? Three daughters. I got full. Let's go to the mix. And you walk to the pizza place member.
