Speaker 1:          00:00:03       Four three, two, one dude.

Speaker 2:          00:00:13       First of all, what possessed you to want to swim around the entire UK? How many thousands of miles is that? Yeah. Uh, 2000 miles altogether. 2000 miles of swimming. Yeah. Yeah. It seemed like a good idea at the time. And then half way round I realized how big Great Britain was. You, you've done some long swims before,

Speaker 1:          00:00:35       but

Speaker 2:          00:00:36       not like nothing even remotely. Like what's the longest swim you did before this? I did. Um, oh, this is a bit of a strange story. I did. Um, I tried to swim between Saint Lucia Martinique to Caribbean islands. Um, it's only 40 kilometers from point to point. And, and for charity, I was trying to swim from point to point with 100 pound tree attached to my trunks. Um, so I was pulling the hunch of foundry, a six foot waves crashing down and, and I actually didn't make it from point to point. I was like five kilometers from the end. And when I didn't make it, I decided to swing back the other way. So I ended up swimming over a hundred kilometers with a hundred pound tree. It took me 32 hours, but still didn't make it. So, so what, what, what went wrong where you didn't make it? Tides currents, you know, and, and I, you just get swept away.

Speaker 2:          00:01:23       Yeah. Yeah. And especially attached to a tree, right? How big secrets his tree. Uh, so a hundred pounds, but I mean, it floats, but it was more of the drag. So if there's any influence from tidal currents and it's pulling you in one direction, I mean, I was basically gonna Miss Martinique know I was heading to Cuba, you know, somewhere like that. And then on the way back down, and they turned to me again and they said like, you're going to miss St Lucia, you're going to end up in how to net whatevers further south than Saint Lucia. Um, and I think I realized this as physically fit as you are. Um, the ocean just, just doesn't care, doesn't care. And so after that, this was last year, this was November last year. Um, kind of felt I had unfinished business with the ocean. Um, came back, came back to England, a rung up from friends of mine at the Royal Marines.

Speaker 2:          00:02:11       I said, guys, look, this is going to sound so, so strange. I said, but I just, I need to get out of my system. I just need to see how far I can swim in 48 hours. So I swan 40 hours. Um, I can't remember. It wasn't there and it was 160 kilometers, something, something like that. And I finished and I had basically trench foot. So where your, your, your feet and your hands are. So kind of, I've got so much water in. This one was going moldy, you know? Yeah. So I had 21, I'm sort of sitting there, nursing, nursing my feet. And uh, one of the, one of the offices, uh, a good friend of mine and they came over and they just said, uh, you know, real English royal. And they said, you boy. And I said, yes. And they said, oh, what do you, what are you training for? And I said, uh, oh. And I'm training for a potentially attempting the world's longest current neutral swim. And then just paused and he sits his cup of tea

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       and he looked me up and down. He just goes at, just sounds a bit lame. I was like, okay, what would you want me to do? And he pauses and he says, you just need to man up. We need to man up and swim around Great Britain. And I was like, Whoa, I can't, I can't. I couldn't say no once the agency, why don't you swim with me bitch, motherfucker, that's a crazy thing for someone to be asking you to do. Now I know, right? So I said, fine. Once the idea stuck with me, I mean, you know, we've got this real history and heritage of, of British eccentric explorers. And for me growing up, there's a story of Captain Web. So the first guy to swim across the English Channel, and for those who don't know English Channel, uh, you know, the tides, they believe what?

Speaker 3:          00:03:44       We're too strong. The water was too cold. They said you just can't make it across. The English Channel isn't possible. But captain web refused to listen and a 1875 August across the English Channel, and this is the part I love on a diet of beef broth and brandy in a woolen wetsuit. He swam, I think it was 23 hours breaststroke with his head out of the water because, and I quote front crawl was ungentlemanly like and there was that element that I just thought that's so amazing. Front crawl, what does the front crossbar, so it's a basically that's front the regular one. Yeah. But way back in 1875 it was like, no, that's sorrows and gentlemanly the movement itself themselves. Yeah. It was still being developed as a technique. Whereas you know, if you are a gentleman and you were a swimmer, you swim breaststroke, you know, exactly.

Speaker 3:          00:04:30       Head out of the water the whole time, the whole way. 23 hours. And again, like th the, the, the support boat was saying, you know, get out, you're not, you're not going to make, you're not going to make it. And he just refused and 23 hours. So you know, that's part of a night swim as well. Had out the water just all the way. Why Brandy? Is he getting fucked up or just a little bit of brand? Do you know? I don't know, maybe it might have been a bit of Dutch courage, but I think there was certainly back then sports nutrition isn't what it is today. Right. So I think there was an element, he was even like lubing himself up in goose fat, you know, this is waiting back and make himself slicker, slicker. And I think there was an element of warm for that was the, certainly the belief.

Speaker 3:          00:05:06       Right. So the Tour de France guys, didn't they drink wine? That was like a big thing back in the day. Way Back. Yeah. I mean it wasn't too long ago. It wouldn't be me and Jamie would just, just, just talking now about football back in England and it wasn't till, you know too long ago, I don't know, maybe a hundred years ago. They used to just keep brandy in the dressing room in case you needed to warm yourself up real and out. Oh yeah. Wow. So they play soccer drunk there. Yeah, kind of just slope with a little bit. Like I said, just turn it over. Wow. Wow. I think, you know, people don't understand that it's taken, you know, people like Captain Web, maybe me to a smaller extent to just raise the bar, push the boundaries and, and you know, you've seen that, I think our generation have seen that with the UFC with mixed martial arts that has evolved so fast. I'm always remember

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       forrest griffin used the kind of a likened himself to the basketball players just shooting three pointers with the ball between the legs, you know? And that always resonated with me because I was like, yeah, the evolution that we've seen and what sort of Bruce Lee had the foresight to predict is amazing. And I think in a, in a much, much, much smaller way. Again, to go back to sort of British athletes and adventurers. Roger bannister first nights running a four minute mile people said couldn't be done. And he was a medical student at the time leading physicians that he can't do it. Your lungs will explode, your legs will fall off. All sorts. But no, he said, you know, Oxford laced up his trainers and ran a four minute mile similar right now to what I think we're seeing with Kip Shogi, you know, and, and the two hour marathon.

Speaker 2:          00:06:43       And so that's why, and again, in a much, much smaller way, when I had that conversation about swimming around Great Britain, everybody said it can't be done. Yes, it's 2000 miles. But there's giant whirlpools in Scotland called the Chorea Vecan pentland firth renowned around the world. If you get that wrong, you'll disappear in backwards at 10 knots. You, there's no way you're swimming against that. And 10 us, that's a dolphin speed. She was 10 knots in miles per hour. A basically 10 miles per hour, 10 miles per hour backwards as you're trying to go forwards basically. Yeah. Penn versus the top of Scotland, the currents that go across there. So it's running at a good clip, but yo, yeah. Yeah. I mean we got it good. We managed to basically predict it so well that I, I think that was probably my top speed, which I did 8.7 knots is 8.7 miles per hour.

Speaker 2:          00:07:32       I was basically cruising along the top, which is wow, we just like a dolphin. So you were having the waves behind you, pushing you almost and see now that's what's interesting because I had the tides and currents with me, not necessarily the way I said it wrong and when you get bit, but actually you made a good point in terms of when you get windover tide. So if you've got 10 knots going this way, but he even got a little bit of wind and waves going this way, it can get choppy again and again. Sort of looking at west Scotland, windover tide, you can get 40 knots coming straight down the barrel, but you're trying to swim with the tide. Yeah, the wind is coming at you, but the tide is going the opposite. And as you can imagine that, oh my God. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:08:16       So how do you predict this, this, this tide that you have to get right? Yeah, I mean it's, it's in completely in theory. And this is what I realized when I sat down and we started sort of plotting the great, what is this called again? What is the, the issue that will push you back? Oh, just the title. Yes. What is it called? That area. Oh, so you got to get right. Oh, so penn unferth pending for the panel and for Pendleton for, yeah. Yeah. And that's that, like I said, renowned around the world. But equally, if you imagine the shape of Great Britain, there's all sorts of kind of compression where the water would just come rushing through. And as well as the panel and firth, you can get, you know, six knots around whales. There's an island called Scoma. And if you get that right, you are disappearing, you know, and you're winning, you get it wrong again, you're going backwards.

Speaker 2:          00:09:06       And for my, for me to do a continuous stage swim, if I'm going backwards, I've got to start where I was going backwards. So for me, getting every single tied right. And that's why so far the team were amazing. There was a, uh, the Captain Matt was just incredible that every night the homework, are we okay here? No. Did we crash? All right folks, if you're listening or watching, we had a little technical difficulty, so this is not streaming live will be uploaded later. We were just going over how you predicted you had to, you and your team had to predict how the tide was coming because if it went wrong you'd get pushed backwards and like 10 miles an hour. Yeah. Basically. And the, and this is the thing, I think with the great British swim, we were kind of taking swimming as most people understand it and we were, we were removing it and putting it in an arena that was so different.

Speaker 2:          00:09:57       So I think that's why it was, it did so well kind of online as well as the community around it because obviously swimmers were interested, but you know, surfers started to get involved because they understood the waves. Um, sailors, fisherman, you know, all sorts of people started to say, you know, sometimes in Great Britain it's not safe to take a boat around the top of Scotland. In it, for instance, nevermind a swimmer. Um, so that's, that's why it was amazing that, that on the entire series it became, uh, a melting pot and exchange of ideas because nobody knew how to get a human body around the coast of Great Britain. It wasn't just about swimming and, and that was what was really cool. How, how do they know, like when the tides are going one way or the other, how do they predict that? Yeah, I mean, tied to so predictable.

Speaker 2:          00:10:44       So in theory, they change every six hours. So in theory, when we sat down and we looked, and we know that if you do six hours on six hours off for 157 days, you'll make it around the coast of Great Britain. You know? And, and, and that was the theory. So you do this by phasic sleep and you swim for 12 hours a day. But that's all theory. There's times when, as I mentioned, a giant whirlpools or, or the tides might not necessarily, if you imagine sort of, that's Great Britain there, the tides don't necessarily go always like this or they're not that predictable. Sometimes if there's kind of like this, like that's kind of whales there, the tides will do this. So you're, you're doing all these different things that people are not going to see instead of listening to it on audio. So just try to just describe it.

Speaker 2:          00:11:28       Right. It's a basically rather than the tides just going up and down and working with you, sometimes they cross cross. Yeah. So you'll just kind of getting slapped across the face. My tides essentially. And it's not just helping you, you're going to basically zigzag all the way up the coast of Great Britain. So it was predictable as tides are. We found those so much stuff that when we're out there we were like, oh, it wasn't meant to do that. Or a giant whirlpool wasn't meant to be there, but it is an, and that was what was pretty, yeah, pretty sketchy. It sometimes, you know that when we were out there, if a whirlpool just decides to appear, you've got you, there's not really enough time to say, oh, hang on, that wasn't on the map. Can we look at that? Can we speak to the Met Office and talk about, you know, weather reports?

Speaker 2:          00:12:10       No, you just, you, I've had to swim through it or, or try and get out there as quick as you could. So when you encounter something like that and you get stuck, do you pull out of the water and try back again later at the same location? You do. But quite often if it was there, it's still gonna be there. Oh, it's just, it is what it is. Yeah. So sometimes there's this notion and, and perhaps the best example of this, I mentioned it for, it's called the Chorea Vecan. So, uh, sort of west coast of Scotland and it's a giant whirlpool. And, and Matt, the captain turned to me and said, look, Ross, you know, I need you to swim and I need you to swim hard. You know, you need to swim six hours. You just need to be clear this whirlpool. Um, so as we were swimming past it, I set my watch and some hard for six hours, but about three hours in, um, I got stung by jellyfish and I've been stung by jellyfish a lot before he sees, you know, it's painful, but it was, it was bearable.

Speaker 2:          00:13:00       Um, but this one particular jellyfish, it just, it was searing into my skin. It just, it wouldn't stop throbbing. And so I carried on swimming, three hours passed and it was just unbearable. So I popped my head up and I looked at Matt, the captain from the boat. I said, man, I'm so sorry I've been stung and, and you know, I'm going to have to stop. Um, I've been stung by a jellyfish, pitched the pain's just not going away. And as, as I said that to him, he looked down at me and he said, yeah, I know, cause the tentacles still wrapped around your face. So I'd basically been swimming for three hours with a jellyfish on your case, wearing a jellyfish. It wrapped into my goggles. So I took my gold, unpeel this fat, tend to call, threw it away. Um, and then like I said, I, I'll show you in a minute.

Speaker 2:          00:13:43       I'll ever, there was a picture where my, my face sorta change shape and the goggles wouldn't fit on my face anymore because my eye sockets were so swelled. And, but I knew that again, for all of this happening, the cory of Eq and the giant Walpole was still to my left. So Matt was like, you still need to swim. You still need to swim. So I ended up paying the goggles over my face and to try and get them to seal, I just punched them into my face. So you just had these perfect ring and then I managed, you're a sore. Swollen. Yeah. So you're a push them through the swelling basically. Yeah. John. So you swim. Um, I made another hour. We got clear the cory of Atkins. We managed to clear this giant whirlpool. I collapse onto the boat and um, and this is the thing, it was at that point that I collapsed exhausted face.

Speaker 2:          00:14:26       Now a different shape to when I started that particular swim. And, um, and the team looked at me and they saw how bad I was, how be it an upper was, but they also knew that the sea just doesn't care. And in six hours the tide was going to change and I'm not going to have to do that all over again. And it was that kind of brutal lesson from nature that, that from a sports science background, I'm interested in, you know, Rehab, rest, recovery, nutrition strategies, all of this. But with sending around Great Britain, it very quickly became apparent that the seed just doesn't care. It just doesn't care that you need to rehab your shoulders. It doesn't care that the ligaments and tendons in your shoulders are hurting. You might get impingement from swimming too much in none of this. And, um, that's why it went from swimming as I understood it and how a lot of people understand it to something completely like surviving basically in the water.

Speaker 2:          00:15:20       So you're swimming schedule, it'd be six hours on and then you would try to rest. When would you eat? Uh, during the swims or, or between Erin? The swims. Yeah. Yes. I quite often just, you know, throwing bananas at me and just multi bananas basically. Yeah. Yeah. Just so deep or not. And you'd eat and while you're in the water. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. Cause, cause again, going back to what we're talking about with the pen and firth, you could get out and you could get on the boat, but sometimes in a really good tide, if you are just in the water, you could be making four knots. You don't have to swim. But if you'd get in the freezing cold water Scotland and you are quite happy to getting hit in the face by a 10th, cause you can still make four knots. And so that's why so often it became about something different than swimming.

Speaker 2:          00:16:06       It was just, it was just mental fortitude. It was physical fortitude. It was, um, basically, I always remember actually, yeah, First Day of autumn, um, I got up, it was two o'clock, so it was a night, 2:00 AM two o'clock in the morning and I left my wetsuit out to dry. And I had to scrape. It's just a thin layer of ice off the wet suit before I could put it. But if I didn't, if I didn't get in and I didn't screw it that, that, that way I see it, then that would have been, you know, 15 miles potentially that we would have missed out on. And if you miss those 15 miles, that the window of opportunity to swim around Great Britain because of the British summer being notoriously unpredictable and quite short. Um, we wouldn't have made it round because even towards the end there was two storms, a storm elements storm Cali Allien Callum, who kind of stopped us for those two days where we couldn't swim because you just couldn't swim in a storm.

Speaker 2:          00:16:59       It wasn't safe. So when you were swimming, this was all during the summer? Yeah, yeah. Uh, freely the autumn. And then we finished November the fourth, which was going into the winter as well. And you started what month? Uh, June. The first. So for, since June you've been swimming basically? God Damn, man. That's so crazy. Yeah, it's interesting too. You're not built like a guy, I'd expect to be doing this. Right. You're building a tank like does not normal like your big jacked guy. You look more like an MMA fighter or a powerlifter even. Right. You don't look like an endurance athlete. Yeah. Which is, and we were just, we were speaking about it cause I, I love the episode with unct Fletcher. I love that guy. I love that. And, and, and you know, as a big fan of, you know, Kathy, you are, look at this fucking picture dude.

Speaker 2:          00:17:47       Get the fuck out of. If someone said that guys get a swim around grape Linda, I was going to swim for half an hour and he's going to have a fucking heart attack there. There was a lot. Yeah, I know I'd probably be inclined to agree with you. But what I find interesting is when you start looking at a strength and stamina for so often, people believe the two couldn't coexist. And Robert Hickson and his, his sort of research ran concurrent training that, um, basically saying if you train for strength and stamina, you dilute the potency of the stimulate. So what what I mean by that is if, you know, we went into the gym just now and uh, you know, meet me, you and Jamie walked into the gym and we were like, okay, okay, let's, let's go and see what we're doing on in the squat rack.

Speaker 2:          00:18:28       You know, that's strength, your body's ability to generate force. And we trained that and then all of a sudden it's like, okay, no, no, no, no. Now let's go over to the rowing machine or let's go for a swim. Let's go and swim 10 k. Then all of a sudden our bodies are going to go, well, hang on. Which one do you want us to adapt to? Looking at molecular biology, which one do you want us to adapt to? Strength and stamina. And again, you dilute the potency, that stimuli. However, there's the theory that if you separate them within the laws, I'm going off on a little bit of a tangent here, but please. Thank you. Good looking at, um, Verkishanski. So one of the greatest strength and conditioning coaches to ever exist. He talks about this idea of adaptive energy, saying that in any given day you have a certain amount of adaptive energy and if you are able to fit both a training session, that that, like I said, causes your body to adapt to both strength and stamina.

Speaker 2:          00:19:16       You separate them under those conditions, they can coexist. So you separated them by how much time? As much as needed for optimal recovery. So, so yeah, if, if we did, and this is the, this is what I find fascinating about mma because you're essentially saying to an MMA athlete, I need you to be strong fast, quick, I need you to be muscular and Jord, but I also need you to apply a metric speed, strength and their body's going, you want us to be all of those things. Right. You know, and that's why quite often it's the athlete with a higher work capacity who can adapt to those looking at like, you know, the Diaz brothers who just do triathlons for fun, you know, they have this insane work capacity. So that's kind of your, your body's ability to perform and positively tolerate training of a given intensity or duration.

Speaker 2:          00:20:01       So if you have the Diaz brothers and you say, okay, we're going to now do weight training in the morning, but by the afternoon I also need you to swim a 10 k their bodies could tolerate that. Whereas if you have another athlete who perhaps doesn't have that work, pasty, their body's not going to positively tolerate it. Right? A person who's used to working out maybe only an hour a day. Yeah, absolutely. So, so that's essentially how I would, would, uh, approach anything like this. But what I found really interesting when you were talking with, with ct Fletcher was when you look at strength and stamina, it's, it's so specific. So you know, said principle specific adaptation to impose demands. You know, you get good at whatever you continually practice. And when you look at endurance in weightbearing sports absolutely know, you can argue that that running for instance is, is just, you know, power to weight ratio.

Speaker 2:          00:20:51       It's a series of successive jumps and when you start looking at that, there's research that will show adding, and we did this with the Royal Marines back in England. When you just add one keeler of extra weight in a backpack, it's effect on pulmonary ventilation, lactic threshold, time to fatigue, all of those things. Just one, one kilogram. That's it. And so that's why when you see tour de France and people like Chris Froome, Bradley wiggins unit from team sky, they are just looking at the body saying okay your vo two is what it is. Your power to, your power to weight ratio. That's what we need to improve. We need to treat you like a formula one car. We need to take away anything, you know. So when you look at Chris' room in an unbelievable athlete and they said, well you don't need biceps, you don't need triceps.

Speaker 2:          00:21:30       So there we'll remove those controlled muscular atrophy. And how do they approach that intelligently? I, I suppose looking at anything from, you know, a calorie deficits are not to pick anything up ever. Kind of. Yeah. And it's just exactly, that's crazy. There is, there you go. No triceps. They don't, they went away. Exactly. But I mean that is, that is the perfect example of, you know, said principle specific adaptation to impose demands that all he does is he lives on a bike. So as a result, his body is, is a byproduct of what he continually practices. Got Bike muscles. Yeah. Yeah. And so, so looking at that and sorry, going back to strength and stamina, when you look at running, you could argue that you know, being jacked and, and being heavier. Yes, absolutely. Your power to weight ratio is going to impact you. So for instance, I like to run but I don't stand a chance against some of my friends who are, you know, fell runners and they way, you know, 30 kilos less than me, however ritual.

Speaker 2:          00:22:30       Exactly. Yeah. And lean longer. Yeah. You look at him, unbelievable specimen of a man. You Go, yes, you were built for endurance, but as soon as you go in the water, things might start to change a little bit because now it's non weight bearing. So the power to weight ratio is a little bit different. So then you could not, and this is all theory for the moment, but looking at the body shape to swim around great brim cause no one's ever done it before. So you can say, okay well what does that body type look like? And when writing down a checklist, you say, we need someone who can swim in, you know, 40 knots of wind, wind over time that we're talking about. So you're not going to break. I'm on top of that as well. You can start to look at, um, all of a sudden we need someone who's never going to take a day off.

Speaker 2:          00:23:12       So I wasn't sick for out of those 157 days. So then you start looking at adaptive energy and, and work capacity there would just spoke about, and then all of a sudden you can start getting real into the detail of looking at, okay, someone with a higher muscle mass, if they're able to effectively swim and the biomechanics are, are on point. So that's not, you know, this muscle mass isn't interfering with their biomechanics. Could it be argued that that's stored muscle glycogen can almost turn them into a human whale. You know that. Yeah, you're right. You put me into the pool with Michael Phelps and he, me, you know, he to look at him swim, it's unbelief. He looks like a dolphin. It's beautiful. But when it comes to something like seminar in Great Britain, it's just, it's just an eating competition, you know, with a little bit of swimming involved and you just need to make sure you don't break.

Speaker 2:          00:24:01       And that goes back to the tides as well. Your body working with ties. If you can just keep getting in the water for 157 days, 12 hours a day and not break, you'll make it wound Great Britain by. So you think the muscle mass aids you in that way? I would argue, yes. Yeah. I mean, and this is purely anecdotal and I'd love to actually do more research into this, but, but certainly with a lot of athletes that I train with that it's almost like a bell curve. So if you can imagine, you know, for those listening like a bell curve like that, how would you describe that? Just to sort of like a horseshoe? Yeah. Yeah. So you can argue that here around endurance. So if you've got somebody who's you know, to use rich rituals, example, an amazing swimmer, the over 10 K he's going to be amazing because there's efficiency in everything.

Speaker 2:          00:24:45       But then pass this point. So when we start looking at the mileage that we were covering, so it sort of English Channel Swim is 20 miles plus a day. At this point, this leaner swimmer's going to start running out of muscle glycogen is biomechanics might break down because he doesn't have the strength to hold that position continually. All of those things, the waves start crashing and he's starting to swimming to 40 knots of wind. What's going to happen? Are you going to be, would you favor the, the lean a quicker, more streamlined swimmer or would you argue that the guy who have more muscle mass here is going to continue to swim? Not necessarily at the same pace, but would continue not to break? I think it depends on who the man with the muscle mass is. Because a lot of guys with muscle mass, they got that muscle mass are doing very low reps, high weight.

Speaker 2:          00:25:30       I mean what, what kind of exercise do you do that gives you a bill like that? See and that's a good point. I mean I loved what you did with them with Dorian Yates and um, I think when you start looking at the, the three mechanisms to build muscular hypertrophy, you start looking at metabolic stress. So metabolic stress being exactly what you just said. Lots and lots of reps during yes being a great example of that. That is more muscular hypertrophy, bodybuilding centric work and that's metabolic stress. Lots and lots of reps. But then you can also look at mechanical tension to that's more your power lifters, you know, really, really high weight, lower volume, just real strength. Your body's ability to generate force. That is what I do. Um, and yes, it's shown to induce muscular hypertrophy is to increase muscle mass, but arguably more functional than when you'd be looking at a, you know, bodybuilding, Mr Olympia, something like that.

Speaker 2:          00:26:22       And then you have a muscle damage, which has more eccentric contraction, some more arguably sort of crossfit a bodybuilder to achieve their physique. Besides using steroids, they have to use lots of repetitions. Yeah. Yeah. That's it. So, so when you say what do I do? I specifically use, it's more mechanical tension. So more power cleans, deadlifts, things along those lines. He's exactly, yeah, yeah, yeah. Cause you're not billing a bodybuilder, but you're, you're built like someone was very strong. Yeah. And I think that's it where you start. And that's not to say, you know, when you look at, you know, to use you as an example. So if we had you in the sports lab, we would say, okay, what is your strength deficits? So your strength deficit is, is I say we had you on the leg press and we said, Joe, we want to, we want to look at how much force your legs can generate with you.

Speaker 2:          00:27:11       Just using basically your training strength training strength is defined as the strength that you would use. Just leg pressing, not getting you all like to cite of preworkouts smelling salts, none of that. We would just say Joe gun leg press and you'd just leg press and that's what you can generate there. But then in the sports I back it left for university, we would start using, uh, basically a lecture basically using electrical impulses to, to make the muscles contract beyond what you could generate yourself. So that is what your body could generate without you trying to send those impulses. Buddies, you the actual, the actual potential muscle, the strength of the muscles themselves. How do you determine that? Like I said, basically, um, a lecture, cheating their muscles and stimulating it in voluntarily and through that they measure it. How so? Oh, so then that measures your, uh, your maximum output with you not trying to use it yourself.

Speaker 2:          00:28:06       It's involuntary. So that is something that you wouldn't have control over. What do they, how do they do that? Like essentially electricity cheap. What kind of, what does it like electrodes and slap on your legs and they force you to extend your legs. Yeah. You would have seen it. Yeah, exactly. That you lift a weight with that. Yeah. You can do, yeah. So that's what they do. Yeah. I've never heard of such a thing. So you would be sitting in a leg press or engineering quad extensions and, and make your legs extend. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. So they would monitor your strengths. So the difference between that, so all of a sudden they'll say, okay, this over here, go training strength is what you could do, Joe, when I was just saying, okay, lift that right. And it's what you were going, okay, I'll lift it.

Speaker 2:          00:28:48       And then over here, when it's involuntary, that is what you could actually do. That's the potential of the muscles. What's usually the higher number? Oh, absolutely. Well, so it's always involuntary, really? Always. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. How much what? And that's the strength deficits. So do you see what I mean? So, okay, so over here, this is what you could generate when you're just going, okay, one, two, three and I'm lifting it myself. Ah, okay. That done. And over here is what we do when it's involuntary now and if there's a big deficit, okay. So if there's a huge deficit between the two, that means you're a pussy. It means your worth. No, it means if there's a large deficit between the two, it means that you have muscle mass but you're not fully using it. So you might see a large deficit between the two.

Speaker 2:          00:29:36       If you had, um, a bodybuilder for instance, cause they've got a lot of muscle mass but they're not using, does that make sense? So why aren't they using it? Because it's, it's strength is functional. So they've got all this muscle mass, but they're not recruiting it. They've not actually trained strength because strength is neuro muscular. So when a bodybuilder does like high repetitions, and what was the type of load that you were calling that? How they were, that was causing hypertrophy range. So that's metabolic stress, metabolic stress. So just a sheer number of sets. Yeah. Just constant repetitions over and over and over again with not that high await. Yes. Yeah. And that's meant about, but then mechanical tension is when, um, it's more powerlifting us. So there's your difference between the two. So the reason being is met. So when you start looking at mechanical tension that might produce an athlete who has a smaller strength deficit, right?

Speaker 2:          00:30:29       So when again, using you as an example, if there was a smaller strength deficit between what you could voluntarily leg press in a leg extension after extension, and then involuntary, there's a smaller deficit, it would like it, I would have likened it to, okay, Joe, you have this much muscle mass, but you're using a lot of your potential. You're using it already. It's almost like you've got a formula one car with a huge engine, but you're using it to its full extent. You know? And, and this is why I'm going off on a slight tangent here, but this is why when you start looking at bodybuilding centric work, so this idea of increasing muscular hypertrophy, it can be a good thing when you understand that strength deficit. So you might have an athlete who you go, okay, you have a small strength deficits, very small.

Speaker 2:          00:31:16       So for the muscle mass that you have, you're using it to its absolute full potential. It's like you have a very small car but you are just pushing down the accelerator so hard and it can't go anymore. It's just red line. Exactly. So the option that we have is to increase the size of the car. The option we have is increased the size, your muscle mass. In some sense it does. Yeah, it does. Um, what kind of training were you doing to increase your capacity for work while maintaining the mass? Yeah, and this, this guy's that is a bit of a strange story. So this goes back to something I always call. Um, you know, horsepower programming, which I think is, it's so often lost now. I think training is very specific when you're going to the gym or you're training for strength, speed, stamina.

Speaker 2:          00:31:59       Whereas horsepower programming I almost borrowed from Soviet Union principles, you start looking at a general physical preparedness as it was, as it was known. And this is this just idea of you take an athlete's only a younger athlete and you're trying to increase their work capacity by nonspecific movements. So you'll get at, you're an athlete, you're handed you a magic, okay, you're young, a kid just growing up and your parents hand you to me, I'm your coach. And I say, okay, I don't know if Joe's going to be big strong. I don't know if he's gonna be able to run far or fast. I don't know. So what we're going to do is just create, increase your sort of neuromuscular efficiency and work capacity. And so by doing

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       that, it's kind of jumps, throws nonspecific, these natural movement patterns, and we get you to do lots and lots of this. What that's doing is work capacity, your body's ability to positively tolerate training and given an intensity or duration. And I think from the great British swim, when a lot of people will say, how was it that you are able to tolerate those 12 hours a day? The jellyfish things and everything. It it for me, one of the biggest things was going back to, and this is gonna sound so odd, but I um, I ran a marathon pulling a car, uh, three, three years ago I think now. Um, and so that is almost the perfect embodiment of horsepower programming in that, that shear stress on the body. But it's not a specific skill. When you say you run a marathon behind a car, pulling a car, pulling a car, pulling out in front of a car.

Speaker 3:          00:33:28       Yeah. Not behind a car. No. Yeah. So it was um, you pull the car and ran a marathon. What the fuck do they said? Yeah, I seem so normal. That's what's so confusing to me. Like if I met you, there's something about a lot of these endurance people. Well how, I guess not Courtney Courtney door. Walter, she's so carefree and silly, but your very loose and relaxed. I always considered like those people are dark. There's some darkness to those extreme endurance athletes. Yeah. There's darkness that they're running from some darkness. You know what I mean? Now I do,

Speaker 2:          00:34:07       I've had this conversation with a few people cause they said something similar and I think it's, um, I mean, you know, to slightly go off on another tangent here cause I think we've covered the physical aspect and, and work capacity, the which, which I've addressed. But I think, and this is one thing I genuine just wanting to almost quiz you on and get your thoughts on this is uh, certainly the Frat, the great British swim, it subjected my body to a fatigue like I've never experienced before. It was just yes, sleep deprivation, just ligaments, tendons in my shoulders. Just wondering what's going on. And um, for me, your most developer, a split personality in that, there's times when I would quite often say you need to swim with a smile because you know, it's 157 days if you're stressed or it's like a marathon where you grit your teeth and you try and get through it.

Speaker 2:          00:34:56       Um, I think we're very aware that, you know, the body is this complex biochemical organism and if you're stressed cortisol levels, spike inflammation, your immune system, everything's affected. So for me, I was treating it not like a marathon. I had to treat it, swim with a smile, you know, think this is, this is life now. Right? Let's see. Um, but then equally there were times when, you know, I wouldn't swim with a smile. It was just, you know, Korea vet can be being a great example. You know, I sent him, he wasn't all that happy then. And, and for me, it's those times when I say, you've got to just get feral. You know, you've really just got to a good friend of mine, you know, back in, back in England, um, ses trained, and he said to me, Ross, your, you're really nice guy and everything, but there's gonna be times when you just need to, you know, no smiles and just get feral.

Speaker 2:          00:35:45       Which, which I thinking about it an end, cause I had 12 hours to think at bay. I was mulling this over in my head. Um, for me, it goes back to Tim noakes central governor theory. Um, looking at how fatigue is, it is an emotionally driven state that we use to pull that physiological handbrake. So, uh, you know, for those listening sorta 60 miles into a marathon, you might be saying, no way, I can't keep putting one foot in front of that. There's no way. And then all of a sudden 25 miles in your family and friends are clapping you and you get that second wind and you start sprinting. Um, and for me, looking at that, this sort of central governor theory, I found that in complete exhaustion, like when when you absolutely have nothing left, you almost go into this feral state, you know, so like, uh, like an like an injured dog, you know, where a lot of people will say, Oh, you know, remember why you started to think of your family and friends.

Speaker 2:          00:36:38       And I was like, no, no, no. I was at a level of fatigue where I wasn't thinking about, you know, family and friends. It, I was thinking almost, you know, maslow's hierarchy of needs, where it starts with just food, shelter, oxygen. I was at that sort of level where there was clcs. I mean, my next kind of healed now, but you know, there was times when chafing on my neck, my, my tongue was falling apart. It's fine now by the way, Jay Thomas fire part my tongue from the salt, salt water. Yeah. Yeah. And, and falling apart on the house or it is what it's called, salt tongue. And after 12 hours in the water every single day, um, your, your tongue would essentially start to disintegrate. So Jesus, yeah. No. So I was, I woke up and there was parts of my tongue on my pillow. And this is, is there any concern of this is permanent or it was prominent at the time?

Speaker 2:          00:37:32       Were you concerned? Absolutely. And I think that that's bad, but that's what goes back to that, that hierarchy of needs where you're not thinking about family and friends or what motivates you and what you know, you know, you're thinking, I want to keep my tongue. You know, you're like, man, because no one has really, has people have gone on long swims before? But has anybody done six months? I don't think so. There there, there's Ben La, compton, the moment who's going across the Pacific, but he is using a snorkel. So he kind of cleverly thought about that. Whereas for me I thought, no, this has to be done without properly. Where you thinking about the guy who was just doing the restaurant and saying, well if he did it, fuck get done. Well and this is it. Yeah, it was wow. So yes and no that and it was at that point that I think, um, you what you are feral, you're just thinking I five one, one arm in front of the other. Keep going. Keep moving. Exactly. That you are soldier pieces of your tongue. This is a video that you made or pieces of your tongue.

Speaker 4:          00:38:36       We're falling apart. Wow. The fact of salt buildup on the tongue, and this is on Ross's instagram was, which is Ross. E. D. G. L. E. Y. I put it up on my instagram too. I re retweeted or reposted one of your, uh, things to let people know about this.

Speaker 3:          00:38:55       Oh, that is so nasty, dude. You can see the taste buds on it. That's how so was it fucking with your taste buds? Oh yeah, yeah. The way you tasted things. Oh yeah. And that started to have an impact on you need the food as well. Cause I mean like Granola, I was eating so much granola, but when that happened it's like rubbing sandpaper on an icon. Yeah, right. He's the grit and the the oats. Exactly. So, and that was how we had to just adapt on the day. So it's during that, that video is great actually. I mean that was in the cabin and I remember just thinking like now I'm not thinking, you know, family and friends to, to talk about those. As you just said, those, those darker moments. I think now it's very easy for me to be very grateful. I'm warm sitting in the studio view. There's, there's no jellyfish, but there's times that where, you know, it was dark with my neck as well. I mean my neck was bad, but we didn't actually catch that. The moment was probably the worst on that where I went to bed with this open wound from the wetsuit, chafing basically. And, um, as I woke up, the bedsheet had fused to my neck. Oh. So I just had to rip it off, put it on the pus. Jesus Christ.

Speaker 4:          00:40:07       Right. And then you had to get in that salt water, which was the felt great. Right? Yeah. Fuck man. What was it like when you finished? What did it feel like when the last stroke, what did you got out of the water and you're like, Holy Shit, I just swam for six months.

Speaker 3:          00:40:24       It was, yeah, it was, it was so strange because when we left in June, we came back obviously to the same point and we left in the British summer and everyone was on the beach and, and then our came back round. People are putting up Christmas decorations and I was like, I had been gone for so long at sea. It was just so crazy. How many days was it a total? 157. Oh my God, that is so insane. It just is so much change in, Oh, here. Yeah, here we go. That was the finished. So this is swimming, but then this is your the or who are these people? These fucking hangers on following you around. Pretend they did it too.

Speaker 3:          00:41:04       So I felt that it was such a team effort. Those people are waiting for you. My legs was so shaky, Joe, at this point I'm thinking, don't fall over. Don't fall over. Wow. Because it has, I mean this is the thing I think I stumbled in. Aluminum does such madness, man. Yeah. It's such a madness and you crossed the red bull finish line. I've got a trident. That was pretty cool. Wow. That's at home at the moment. Oh, they hooked you up? Yeah. What's that made out of? It was really sturdy. I don't know. I think it was like a bronx style thing, but blue, all these fucking phony do it with them. I said, I was like, I feel that the way that it captured everyone's my age just only felt right to do that. Do you swim? Yes. You do.

Speaker 5:          00:41:51       Christina. Pool come and get involved. I didn't even know about it. You know how I found out about you? Because I was, I, I was reading on the Internet and I found out about it and I sent it to all my friends after sober October to show what pussies we were. I was like, guys think what we did was hard and we did ain't shit. I sent it to Tom and burden our, and we were all just like fluff because whenever you hear about someone doing something crazy, there's always someone who does something far crazier to one up the crazy person. And then it keeps going and going and going. Like there's a race that courtney doe, Walter, who's been a guest on the show before, she won the Moab to 40 which is a 238 mile race through the mobile APP mountains. And it's just an insane race.

Speaker 5:          00:42:36       Not only did she win it, she wanted it by more than 10 hours ahead of the second place guy when she's just a fucking straight savage. So she recently entered a race and she came in second place and this race, they would run for four miles in an hour and then they would stop when the hour was over. They would stop and then when the next hour started, they would run another four miles, like four point something miles. And they do it for six days. That's crazy. They did is still like the last man standing. And then at the very end, one person one like, it's like, who's going to drop out last? So they just kept doing it. So the guy who created this race, see if you can find anything on this guy because he's apparently very sadistic. And his idea was that people run these 100 mile races or a 50 mile race and if you just finish, you feel like a winner. And he's like, well bullshit. He goes, there can't be a winner if, if somebody comes in first place and then your your second place, you're not the winner. It's like there's one winner.

Speaker 3:          00:43:38       Oh yeah, yeah. He's apparently chain smokes too. He's amazing. So this is the Berkeley marathons, you know about this. Did you see last same guy he ran, he created that race. And this is another race he created. He's amazing. So did you see, I think it was last year, Jamie, is it right then? It's the Berkeley Marathon. What does the Berkeley Barkley, Matt Barkley, Berkley or Barkley, the Barkley, the one that nobody could figure out how to Mark Lee at the Barkley guy with the weird one. And I think it was if you searched his jamie's well, I think it was last year or the year before, I believe it's the 24 hours or 40 hours, but the guy missed out on finishing it by, I think it was a minute rant and then at the end and you see him on the floor, he's absolutely devastated and he didn't, he may take a wrong turn somewhere along the line cause it's really difficult to follow that path. Yeah, admirably. He just got and he shook his hand

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       and just said, I just want to thank you. You know, for that he said sometimes, you know the Barkley Barkley Marathon wins, but you know that that takes something different. Well, definitely takes something different to see a final, if I'm correct in how they do it. I retweeted the courtney daughter water one. I retweeted it from Courtney where it says it's like getting punched in the face very softly over and over and over again. Yeah, that's exactly, yeah. I compare it to being punched and put it up. Put the article up version of the article. I don't know if it's the exact one. Yeah, yeah, that's exactly it. So if you scroll down, you'll see the, the the specifications. Yeah. Yeah. And this is what I find amazing because then it becomes about something completely different. I mean we were just talking now about Kyc Shogi and the two hour marathon, but it's like if you pick, put Kip chokey into this, you know who's going to win?

Speaker 4:          00:45:27       It says they had an hour to complete the 4.1667 mile loop and then they finished within 15 minutes to spare the bell clangs again, it's 7:40 AM they run it again and then at 8:48 AM they run it again. At nine 40 they were running again. So every hour you run this 4.1667 mile loop. And then the bell just keeps clanging for forever. Why do you, why do you think there's more people doing these events now? Well, I think it's the same thing as everything else. The same thing as if you buy a car today, you wanted to accelerate from zero to 60 in two and a half seconds. Yeah. A few years ago that was unheard of. If you buy a computer today, you want it to be 3.8 gigahertz and five terabyte hard drive. And that's, it's the same every year. We want improvements. And I think when you hear someone's going to run a 100 mile race, you go there, yeah, that's cute.

Speaker 4:          00:46:31       Uh, but I'm gonna run 200 miles. And they're like, that's not even possible. The same as the four minute mile, right. Someone runs a 200 miles. You're like, Holy Shit, I can't believe a guy rants for three days. You were in 200 miles. And then someone like courtney comes along, goes, I'm going to do it in two days. And then she runs, she runs it in two days. And then someone, they're talking about now doing a 500 mile ultra marathon. Yeah. But, and what I find amazing, who, what's the athlete look like? Who completes that? Do you know what I mean? He's, and he's very thin. She's very light and very thin and you know, she's not the type of person that would win a regular marathon. This was what it was interesting. My friend Cam Haynes, who also runs these, he ran the, uh, he's quite, he's pretty Jack.

Speaker 4:          00:47:12       Yeah, he works, he lifts a lot, but he cuts a lot of body weight when he does those. Okay. But the way he does it is he's a hard man. He's what I was talking about, like the speed have darkness. Yay. He's got some darkness. He just like, he'll burn 3000 calories, eat 2000. And so he'll force his body to eat itself. Right. And so he drops down to the hundred and 60 something pound range. And then that's what he likes to weigh. When he normally walks around like one 85, it's pretty built. But then he drops way down. He'll lose like 20 pounds of muscle cars. He's always lean. He's not losing body fat. He's just forcing his body to literally eat itself just through mental toughness. But he's still quite big. Even when he's tending up on the start line and he's lost that.

Speaker 4:          00:47:55       He's still big for a year for an endurance athlete. Amazing. But maybe that's one of the reasons why he doesn't win these things. He comes in like third fourth you mean? And also, you know, he hasn't been doing it as long as them and he's 51 years old now, but he's an animal man and this is just that, that kind of mental fortitude that it takes to do one of those things where to do what you did. It's a very unusual kind of drive and people are very excited by that drive and they're very intrigued by it and it's very attractive. It's very attractive to attempt to do. It's very attractive to pay attention to and watch cause everyone knows how difficult he said. It's undeniably difficult. Like if someone says, you talked to someone who doesn't know how to run it all does, they don't do anything.

Speaker 4:          00:48:38       They just sit on the couch. You Go, hey man, get up, get up. We're going to run three miles. Like fuck. At the end of that three miles, they will collapse the lay down their back. Their heart would be pounding the chest to be heaving so they know that's hard. Everybody knows that's hard. Everybody at one point in their life has run until they were exhausted, whether it's 500 yards or five miles or whatever it was every from when you were a kid. There's always been a moment where we tested ourselves, so we're familiar with that feeling of not being able to go on. So when they see a guy like you who went through that feeling for six fucking months, or was it five months total? Five months, five months, man. Five months is an insane amount of time. It is now upon the June, July, August, September, October, November.

Speaker 4:          00:49:28       You're into the sixth fucking month when you stop. That's insane. But, but what you just said, they're like, do you think, and this is again cause I had 12 hours to think every day. Do you think is unusual or do you think that we now think is unusual because society has got real comfortable, you know, and I maintained that stuff that I was doing with salt 10 and everything ancestors. Do you not think they would have just thought, yeah that's, that's just Monday. You know, just, I don't think anybody ever thought that was just Monday. No, I don't think they would have forced themselves to do that because there's no biological or evolutionary need to do that. It's not like you could swim for 12 hours a day and get across the channel and get to a place where there's better fruit. They know that are, I don't think our ancestors ever did that.

Speaker 4:          00:50:13       I think. I definitely think they did. What does that type of a hunting, there's, there's actually a term for it. Sharon's hunting. Well they run an animal down, I don't think it's called endurance hunting. I think it's, there's another term for it, but they will literally, like if you take an antelope, they don't have sweat glands, so they can run far faster than us, but it comes a point in time when they overheat. So if you just stay on them persistence hunting, that's okay. I named it right when you pulled it up. Damn. Um, persistence hunting is in, you see it in these, a lot of these African men who go on to be phenomenal endurance runners. I mean, they win marathons left and right, and his particular parts of Africa that produce incredible runners and they think a lot. There was a really, there's an cut and run is a fantastic episode of radio lab that details these men from this one certain part in Africa.

Speaker 4:          00:51:09       I forget where it is, but see if you pull that up. But this, uh, this episode detailed the horrific circumcision rituals that these men had to endure where they cut their Dick and, uh, they, they stick a stick through it and then they make them crawl through thorns naked, right? Yeah. So I sold it. There's a guy a back in, uh, I think it's at Bruce Paris. He's an adventurer. He has done everything you can think of every tribal initiation. And that's the one that he refused to do it for him. Keeping Dick tact dealt those crazy guys. Cut Your Dick. The sand or the oldest inhabitants of southern Africa where they have lived for almost 20,000 years. The term San is commonly used to refer to a diverse group. Diverse group of hunter gatherers living in South Africa. Share historical linguistic connections. Many now except the term Bushman or sand.

Speaker 4:          00:51:59       Is that, that's bushmen hunting. Is that from the radio lab thing? That's what they call themselves. You see article here, which I would imagine, yeah. Is it the same? But is that the same with the uh, the horrible circumcision ritual? I'll double check. Yeah, the hall, it's fucking horrible. But they were arguing in the, the, when they were discussing it and one of the guys who was on and who had actually been through it and now I believe he lives, he lives, maybe he lives in America, but he was saying he would never have his children go through that. But he, but it made him who he is. And the idea was that not only are these guys physically gifted, but they also have unbelievable, unbelievable pain tolerance and mental endurance and just mental toughness. And that this is one of the reasons why they become so successful is that the ability to push a pace for two plus miles or whatever it is, their marathon time is not just dependent upon their physical ability, but also dependent upon their ability to endure pain and to force themselves past, you know, anyone could kind of trot along at a really leisurely pace and it's not painful, but if you're going to hard, no, you're really going hard.

Speaker 4:          00:53:09       This is the radio lab. This Kenya. Yeah, it's the, yeah. Cut. Pogie I think is, ah, here we go. So, um, before you, uh, I mean, well I've, I've kind of described it, but they describe it even more detail

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       in the podcast. It's, that almost crosses over to, I mean, again, I'm not advocating what you just genitalia mutilation, I'm not advocating that. But there's that idea of adversity training that like if you're ever in the gym, he's like, what you training? And it's just like strength, what you're training speed. And this is why, you know, I'm a huge fan of Wim Hoff because so often what he's doing when he's submerged in ice cold, it's like, well I'm training my cup. Hilary's, yeah. What do you mean you're training your cup? Hillary's and it's, these were atrophying, these age old inbuilt mechanisms. So again, I'm not advocating, you know, what general, but do you remember king tolerance, teaching tolerance? Do you think that I that's maybe missing, I mean, again, looking at mma like maybe that you, you see, you know, whether it's uh, you know, moo tie and they're like kicking trees and stuff. Yeah. Granted that's, you know, making denser bones and stuff. But do you think there's that element as well? And when you look at, um, what was it? Um, I forgot what it was now, but you just start looking at just putting people in high stress situations just to see how they're going to cope. Like John Fit. He was like notorious for letting people almost try and submit him and then they tie themselves out. He was just completely calm. And then

Speaker 5:          00:54:44       that really depends on who's choking you. Cause Josh Kirkman choked him completely unconscious. Okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah. You know, Berchmans got a hell of a guillotine and John Fitch shot in on them and Berkman caught them and the good team to sleep and the first round, right. I think it, there's, there's guys that can just put you to sleep. Right. Okay. If you think that you can get away with that shit with like a Marcello Garcia, you're going to wake up going, what happened? Okay. Yeah. Okay. Most guys won't be able to choke you.

Speaker 2:          00:55:15       So to that point, you know, and again, I'm catching up on 157 days. If you have c in his life, it was actually out at sea with the Mcgregor and could beep. But on that note, do you think he tapped premature? Do you think there's not asleep? Mcgregor went to sleep.

Speaker 5:          00:55:28       Oh, that in that fight, I thought you meant John Fishing net crank, right? No, he did not tap premature. Um, he did not defend it though. K, here's the deal. He was done. He was beaten down. Khabib fucked him up. Could be smashed him. But there was a lot of people that don't train and this was very frustrating to me. Like there are as many people that don't train that think that that was something that you shouldn't tap to there. They're out of their fucking mind. Okay. That is what's called a fulcrum Cho. That's okay. It's, it's not necessarily a choke, but it is. It chokes you, but it really feels like you're fucking head's going to pop off. What he's doing is he's wrapping around the face and you don't have to even go under the jaw. You can get it on the chin, especially if you're as strong as could bead.

Speaker 5:          00:56:14       Then you clamp your hands together and you're pressing your forearm against his back. So you've got this and you've got the forum against his back and you're doing this. Just leave his fucking head. It's just like it's, and Khabib is so strong. His Greg, he's been grappling since he was a baby. All of his muscles are designed to squeeze and crush smash and he gets a hold of your neck in that position and he's got that forearm pressed against your back. See if you can find an image of the actual submission. You could really clearly see what he's doing. And then there was a video where dean lister and my friend Hans Molan camp described it as pulling that up and it's been taken off instagram for that video to Hahn's Molin Camp Dean lister video. Well maybe someone to re posted it and that link is gone, but yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:57:05       Huh. Um, did you tech Dean listers? That's so weird. Wonder why anybody would take that down. Anyway, there's guys who could fuck your face up without even going under the neck. A good example. Here's another good example. Just pull this up. You got it. Okay. The one from right after the fight, but he's still describing it. Oh, okay. Oh, this is perfect. This is perfect. So Dean lister, who's a world champion, Brazilian jujitsu black belt, as legit as it gets, and this is my friend Hahn's Moline camp. He's also Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt and see, see, this is exactly what could be. Did see how it's forearm is pressed against the back and the arm is under the chin. See, the differences with Dean is doing, he can't even help himself. He's immediately putting his arms, his hands on the arm that's choking him. That's what you're supposed to do.

Speaker 5:          00:57:55       Now, if you look at what connor did, Conard just waited until he couldn't take it anymore and tapped. Right? Right. When you see conor, both of his arms are down, he's getting his neck crank and he doesn't do this. That's what you're supposed to do. He's supposed to do two on one and then you dropped out. Like, look at this, see what he's doing there. He's tapping. But see where his left arm, his left arm should not this you. You can't, you can't do that. See, that is a perfect example of the fulcrum choke. See how he's doing that? Pressing his forearm against the back, squeezing the head. It's, it's a neck crank. It's a choke. There's a lot of shit going on there. It doesn't have to be under the chin. It could just be on your face and you're going to get fucked up.

Speaker 5:          00:58:37       So all those folks out there that were saying that it wasn't a choke need to go have someone apply that to them. They need to start training Jujitsu and stop fucking talking about MMA submissions cause they don't die that you're going to tap bitch. Don't say you're not going to tap. You get a fucking tap. Right. Not everybody's going to tap from that because other people, unlike connor, are going to be better at defending that. They're going to get like you get a hold of a worldclass Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt who's also an MMA fighter like um, like vinny magallanes. He's going to grab a hold of that. He's going to defend properly. He's going to adjust. He's going to try to get out of that. He might have to tap if someone gets him in it. I mean he people tap, but he's, he's not going to just have one arm posted. That's just not the right way to handle it. But I think that's because connor had eaten

Speaker 2:          00:59:26       bombs when I was about to I, so that's all technical. So you, so there's that almost as a, as a, I don't know, like a continuum. There's technical, which you've just, you didn't bring it. And then, and again I should point out, you know, again, I'm a complete layman when it comes to a mixed martial arts, but I find it fascinating the, this adversity training aspects. So you were just saying he was eating bombs before that would have, would it have helped you know that if he wasn't, do you know what I mean? Where, where does it cross over from being,

Speaker 5:          00:59:52       it would help if he wasn't as tired. So like if that choke was applied during the first few seconds or minutes of the first round, I think he probably would have had a good chance to survive. Okay. Okay. What's going on, put on dean lister as equal. Chokan is not, it's not being done well, but this is a diff, this is not an exact, you'll choke. This is, this is a, what this is is, I mean it's kind of an Ezekiel, but see where his hand is. You got to really get underneath. See his left hand. That left hand's got to go, not just there. It's got to go under the chin. That's not good enough for a guy like dean. You got, I'll get now it's pretty fucking tight. Now it's tight and he's got to get further and further. And the further that left arm gets into jeans, neck, the more more.

Speaker 5:          01:00:39       There's going to be a possibility of him choking. But Dean has been fucking choked his whole life, which is, but I do have to say that Josh Barnett bade him tap and Josh Barnett is like one of the few guys that's made dean lister tap. And I think the first time he tapped in a decade and Josh Barnett got him in a scarf hold. Um, and that was in Metamorris. And Josh Barnett who is a, he's a catch wrestling specialist. Yeah, go to the very end of it here. Josh Barnett gets a hold of deans. He gets it. C in this position right here. He's inside control, which is just impressive enough that Josh was able to do this with a guy like dean lister, but then he gets him in. What's a, I don't know, he probably has a different name for it, but it's a, we used to call it judo side control.

Speaker 5:          01:01:29       It's quite a bit further down on this. You've got to keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going all the way to the end. So he gets a hold of his, he's got a head and arm choke. Here it is. Here it is. So he's got his head and his arm trapped together and Josh, who's an enormously powerful person is really neck cranking him as much as anything. And then dean was forced to tap, but this is at the end of a long match and you know, it could have been exhaustion, might've played a part in it. It most certainly was josh. His skill and his ability to apply that technique. But the point is, is a guy like dean lister, you, you're not going to tap that guy easy.

Speaker 2:          01:02:10       But this is an, again, again with sort of holding my hands up saying I'm so sort of naive, a huge fan of Evan May, but not necessarily any of the technical aspects. But what I love

Speaker 5:          01:02:20       is when you look at someone like you know, Nick Diaz, all Michael Bisping, you know, people don't understand his conditioning and he will just wear people down. Massive mental toughness to would bisping has is just insane mental toughness. You know, bisping basically has one eye. If you look at his eyes, his one of his, I actually, and I hope he can get surgery on it now because he has retired, he has oil like embedded in his eye to protect his retina because it's been torn so many times been torn. He had surgery on it, he had a repair torn again. His right eye is fucked up man. And one of the reasons why he retired as he started to see some irregularities in his vision in his left eye. So as good I was fucking up too. But I mean, Michael Bisping is a fucking animal. I mean he is, he is about as tough as it gets.

Speaker 5:          01:03:11       And he's not like a spectacularly physically talented guy like a Jon Jones or Yoel Romero who was just this unbelievable specimen. Michael's a, you know, a really good athlete unquestionably. But it just taught just fucking tufts. So to answer your question, there's, there's this in, you could speak to this because what you're talking about, the ability to overcome adversity like some people when you were talking about that fatigue is an emotionally driven thing that there's this feeling that you get and you can give in to that feeling where you're like, oh my God, I'm fuck, I fucking can't do this anymore. And some people are more susceptible to that than others and they give into it quickly. I mean, for a person, here's, here's where you can experience this. Like what is, whether or not your mindset can affect your, your endurance, get on a treadmill or a stationary bike or whatever you want to do for cardio.

Speaker 5:          01:04:09       And then listened to a really kick ass song and put on headphones and that song comes on and you just can't fucking, Eh, you could just go, there's something about that. And even if you're tired, even if you're tired and you've put on a good song, like fuck that, we're going to keep going like that. Nothing has happened. You haven't taken in any kind of a supplement or any kind of a stimulant that you haven't gotten an injection in your body or you're not sucking on some kind of new gas. Your body's exactly the same. But through the motivation that you're getting from this music, the emotional stimulation, you're just like, fuck that. We're going to keep going. Yeah. And you can keep going. And not only can you keep going, you can go faster, you could push harder. You can find these reserves. So the idea is that these reserves are always there. You have to be able to achieve this state of mind that you achieve when you hear a really good song. You know, and that's true that I think people don't understand. You are the outcomist of your own body that you know in terms of neurotransmitter's chemical signals in the brain, you can impact though sometimes. Yeah, you need extended liveness his music, because you spoke about sometimes you know caffeine, but

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       when you start to control them, yeah, it can be so powerful. Some people do it naturally, I suppose, and they've just got it in built. But when you start to trend, and I think it's only now that we're, we're going down that route and looking at that as a, you know, until previously it was one of those intangibles that you, you, you kind of under appreciate it in any sport and now we're going, oh, okay. Yeah. You know, that person over there is, you know, that mental fortitude or what you're talking about there is maybe their ability to alter their own chemistry, biochemical reactions, the body and yeah, there's something real that happens, right? Yeah. Yeah. When you hear a song and you get excited, like whatever that hair, whatever that that burst is. It seems like a real, like if that was a pill and you took it, you be like, oh this works.

Speaker 3:          01:06:02       Absolutely. And the thing is is it's been around years when you look at like um, you know Marcus Aurelius Meditations will stomach philosophy and they're talking about you know, dialogue being both external, internal. So the, the conversations that go on inside your own head to just as important as the conversations that we have with other people. So we've understood this for years, but it's only just now that we're trying to kind of apply a little bit of science to it, looking at the psychology in this mind body connection, but the fact is yes, some of the greatest ancient stoics they were trying to figure out as well. And when you can start to tap into that, where that can become and, and it might be a particular song, you know, might be a bit, is something, you know, if you get into, you're going to a gym or that you've got a friend that can bring the out of you.

Speaker 3:          01:06:45       Again, you knew my training back home. So you know, Andrew Bolton, who was the, the first guy to dead lift a thousand pounds. I mean, cheeses. Yeah, yeah. I mean thousand pounds. Yeah, I mean the, the clip when you see it and he pulls a thousand pounds per se. It's since been being by Eddie Hall who did a half the time. So he did lift off. Fuck. Editing isn't a half a ton of thousand pounds that a little bit less. So I think thousand pounds. What's that for? I thought a ton was 2000 pounds, isn't it? So yet, uh, Eddie, what's a thousand pounds in kilos? Oh, you're trying to kill us. Sorry. The two. So yeah, there was two metrics there. So Andy Bolton, which was a little bit 0.2 kilos per pound. No 2.2 pounds per kilo. Yeah. And then, yeah, and when you see him, I mean this is what I love when you start looking at Jesus Christ as this is Eddie, that's his, that's his half a teller fucker. His knees staying together. Right there you look at is, if you look at how big his body is and how normal sizes, knees are, look at the bones in his knees. They look so normal. Yeah. I mean that dies fucking people I know. It's unbelievable.

Speaker 3:          01:07:53       Unbelievable. Oh my God. So when those guys retire, how fucked up or their bodies, how would, do you know Eddie's law? What's brilliant about the bees tattooed his inside of his arm. So he's going to argue with them. Yeah, you're a fucking beast. And he's nose was bleeding. Oh, that's right. Right. His nose started spraying blood while he was without him or another guy though I think you on another video, Arnold, I forgotten his name. He was

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       Russian and just shit. But I mean Eddie against the strength, especially with the dead lift such as simple movement and, and you know the dead lift is just strength is your body's ability to generate force in. So it's neuro Musculus like what your, your brain is telling your body. So that goes back to that strength deficit that we were talking about. Your basically santee or your body recruit every single muscle fiber possible and working conjunctions with ligaments and tendons and then let's get half a ton off the floor. Exactly right. But when you look, and certainly with, with Andy Barnes, a thousand pound lift, he had his friend in his face and he's, they're going to come, I go and he's hitting him in the face when we were talking earlier about against strength deficits is, is that sort of deficit between what you can voluntarily contract an involuntary contract that was him obviously voluntarily can drag there.

Speaker 2:          01:09:09       No one was alleged human that pretty particular one. But they're there and you do anything that you can before you actually step out onto that platform. And now, I mean, he would have just been completely written off after that, that sort of Adrenal dump afterwards. He'd, you know, emotionally, but, and so you have to, you have to think about that. Have I forgotten who said it now? It might have been prevail, but they said, you know, a safe fatigue for competition. And I know you've spoken about that before, so, um, I can't remember. He was speaking to levels are fascinating guy with his concepts. Amazing. Yeah. So, so ahead of the curve, and I know you were talking to, I can't remember who it was now, talking about farmers strength and that ability to stop short every single day. So never necessarily going to complete failure, but it was for us, for us a hobby, I think it was.

Speaker 2:          01:09:55       Yeah. Um, talking about continually kind of avoiding that exhaustion phase and solely existing in the adaptation phase. So, you know, I mean, this goes back to sell you sort of 1936, a Hungarian physician who found, you know, you give a, you know, it took some lab rats, give them a lethal dose of poison. They kill over and die. But he found by giving them a little bit of poison and a little bit more, a little bit more that they built up this intolerance to it. And that was the general adaptation syndrome. But it was from that that we discovered stress and stimuli is the key to any adaptation. And it wasn't until the strength and conditioning community cottoned on to that. And we started to think, okay, how can we apply stress and stimulate to the body to bring about a desired result. And I think certainly now, I think that's kind of overlooked in sport, but certainly the Wida fitness industry that, you know, it's, it's, it's easy now in very sort of marketing driven to say get fit in, you know, five easy steps or you know, whereas the reality is, you know, it's get fit in eight months after a lot of stress and stimuli, but then get fit in five easy steps is really just for, it's just a gimmick to get people who don't actually work out to get involved.

Speaker 2:          01:11:04       It is. And, but, but, and that's why I love what you broadcast. And even with the sober October and stuff. I mean, I'm a huge fan of burt, but people, and I know he's, he's so funny and loves Berg, but

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       he's a beast as well. I mean, when it to rock up and just do a marathon and again, that's a power to weight ratio. What he did was amazing and I've say he's really fat. I'm not saying, I would never say Oh was okay, wink wink. Gotcha. I get it. He's a burly guy. He's a well built a nice way. He's a well built mail. Somebody took a picture of my face, I'm burns body and I was fucking threw up or what if I were there? I'm like, no. Yeah, he likes

Speaker 5:          01:11:48       drink and he's still, he's, he is a beast because he, despite the fact that he doesn't look like rich roll, he's still can keep going.

Speaker 3:          01:11:57       Um, people, I don't know. He was, he was very entertaining. We did the marathon and stuff, but I was actually watching that as the sport's scientist in me was like, that's amazing. And no one's talking about that. His, his power to weight ratio and he's still running that raffin something that and and yeah, so first as funny and as entertaining it, it was to watch, I honestly was like Bert, that's amazing.

Speaker 5:          01:12:15       What's more amazing is Ari honestly, cause Ari really didn't work out. Ari came in second place and he came in second place by only a thousand points, which is a one day I got a thousand points in a day. So he was really only a thousand points behind me but it's a crazy day. That's like a seven hours of work in a day or so. At least six and a half hours of work in a day and a lot of it at 80% of your max heart rate. But he still, he wasn't doing anything before this thing started and he was the first one to figure out that you get the same amount of points for 80% of your Max heart rate as you do for 90 I thought you'd get more for 90 so I was just trying to kill myself every day and then I was only being able to come out with like 230 points and and similar along those lines, because I was, I would max out, it was doing like 90% of my max heart rate for like 30 35 minutes. I was like exhausted. And then Ari figured out that 80 points pays just as much. Right. And so he started watching movies while he was on an elliptical machine and that that just turned the whole thing into this sort of steady, not fast marathon, which was really fascinating because I never exercised like that before and it changed my endurance radically over a month. What's interesting is that changed my endurance in things that are explosive, like kickboxing.

Speaker 3:          01:13:35       Okay. What's it say having that aerobic base a lot? How did he

Speaker 5:          01:13:43       set in? So I would do, I would do, after a while we were doing so much exercise and I had to do different things or I would get bored. So I would do a circuit of the elliptical machine and then I would follow the elliptical machine with, um, a war. Or I would do, I would run on Sundays, I'd either run elliptical machine, kickbox, and on other days I would do the echo bike, which is an airdyne machine that rogue makes. And then I would do the rowing machine and then I would do the versaclimber

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       and then I added in that air runner treadmill, which is, what is it called? Air Assault, I think. Air Assault. Treadmill. Yeah. Which is a treadmill that you power yourself, you, you, your feet pushing on it and pulling it is what makes it go fast. It's not like a treadmill that you keep up with. It's actually more difficult than actual running. Great. Right, right. 13% more difficult and actual running on the street. So I d I was going crazy. I couldn't do the same things over and over again. So I kept mixing them up and when I would mix them up by the end of the month, my kickboxing was, I had way more endurance. Like I could do 10 hard rounds going three minutes each round and then I would recover in between rounds. The one minute in between rounds I'd recover quick cause I'm wearing a heart rate monitor and watching my heart rate dip.

Speaker 3:          01:15:02       It was dipping really quickly. And then I had all this energy and madness like everything was changing. Like my, my capacity for work changed, everything adapted. I got a little dehydrated one time and I had pissed. It looked like ice tea, which is not good. So I started panicking and wondering about things like rob dough, my locis kidney failure, but I didn't have anything wrong with that. It was just a little bit of penetration. But what's interesting to go about, what we were talking about that you've just perfectly described, that idea of, of given a clear cellular signal to the body. So polarized training. If you know the 80 20 that you do, 80% of your, you know, your work, your training in that aerobic realm where you can keep doing that, it's, you're not going to overtrain there, you're going to avoid that exhaustion things he says, Salvia indestructable rats, you know, you're not going to keel over and die from a lethal dose of stress and stimuli.

Speaker 3:          01:15:53       But then over here, you know you would that 20% it was powerful. It was kickboxing. So there you're working technique but you're fresh. So you're drilling motor patterns that completely fresh and not fatigued because you're doing this 80% on an elliptical trainer while watching a movie. So you teach, you're keeping the two completely separate. Yes. But considering the body in its entirety that when it comes together, you've created a more powerful version of yourself. And I think it was interesting what you just said there about recovery between bouts as well. So when you start looking at a strong man training, you know, the, some of the strongest guys and that one of the strongest guys in the world all understood the benefits of, of cardio spiritually training. You look at you again, geoff capes. Um, two time world's strongest man was running fell racism marathons at 25. So fillery's fellow races. It's, yeah, it's quite specific to England. So it's kind of trail running, but we call them fellow running because you're going to going through bogs and marshes and felled trees. Not, not necessarily fell cheese, but just kind of the terrain is a little bit different from Troy said he was doing that. When you look at our Bill Kasman again, well the strongest man a power lifter, but understood the benefits of, of cardiorespiratory trying to improve his recovery between sets. Brian Shaw as well. One of the, uh, you know, the sort of,

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       uh, you know, the newest as sort of strong man and a former basketball player, you know, so he had that cardio respiratory endurance that base the aerobic base, and then he built this incredible strength on top of that aerobic foundation goes back again to whether, you know, they knew it or not, they were almost creating an athlete. Like they were creating athletes back in, uh, the sort of Soviet Union era when they were taking athletes going, right, you're giving me a kid and I don't know if he's strong, quick, good at running, running fast or running fight, I don't know. So we're going to build this aerobic neuromuscular base and when they show any sort of genetic potential to be strong, quick, whatever, we're going to hone in on that. And that's only when we're going to get specific. And you're almost doing that now, you know, and certainly Brian Schorr did it again.

Speaker 2:          01:17:58       You look, you look through all of the best athletes in the world. They've all followed this blueprint, but it's only now that we're kind of dissecting that and saying, okay, I'm making it a bit more purposeful. Who's this gentlemen? Here we go, there's Brian Shore. He said, yeah, bass run with his legs were all swollen, but I mean even now I tell you what Jamie, if it's possible, actually, I mean Brian Shore, he accidentally, you must have seen this clip set, the indoor rowing record. I think it was for a hook in this size of this mother fucker. Oh my God. And he rocks. Converse. All stars. Look at that. Cool. He set the visit visit clip on Youtube. That memo man's wearing chucks. He sets, there's a clip on youtube where he sets the, the rowing record, the indoor rowing record and it was just because he, yeah, there we go. He didn't know he was setting in. So these basically down there, he's rowing and it sounds like someone started an engine like this. He go and we're here at this, said this, they've just looked at how he rose to the mountain.

Speaker 6:          01:18:59       These look the whole thing. They have to hold it down in the end cause he's coming out of the floor. Jesus Christ. These guys are standing on it. It sounds like, like just an that's a jet engine, right? We're all that power from it.

Speaker 2:          01:19:13       Exactly. Well no and he's bad. I mean that technique as well. I mean I hope Brian doesn't mind me saying it's not necessarily, you know, Olympic rowing technique, but he doesn't need it cause he's just got silly power technique. So the hundred well there's a catch phase and it's more, you're almost treating it more like a dead lift where you're using your larger leg muscles where, which is

Speaker 6:          01:19:36       look at him go, there you go. Oh my God. Fuck it. Savage.

Speaker 2:          01:19:44       Oh crazy. To Watch. Unbelievable amount of force he can generate. He looks like a very tall man too. He's huge. How big is this guy? Six eight, six, nine. So that helps too. Right? Cause the long stroke. Absolute. It's just pure power. But anyway, so they found that they, during this session, I believe what happened is they said, well you know a rower shouldn't make that sort of noisy. He goes six ways that he's basically two put together for what? 401 600 8,425 that's two big guys strapped together in one body. He's almost 200 pounds above the UFC heavyweight limit. Deon saying that is UFC heavyweight, limit it to 65 he's almost 200 pounds too heavy to fight heavyweight division of the UFC motherfucker basketball, basketball background. And, and he's still, look, he didn't know that he was going to set the world record for rowing.

Speaker 2:          01:20:39       So the rowing record, they go, here's one was 12.8 I believe it was 1308 broke the wrong record. But because he had that neuro neuromuscular background that they said, Hey Brian, you're big and powerful, just this is a rowing machine. He went, oh, okay. And it's like, oh, there you go. Congratulations. There's a world record. So it's that base that I think so often I've heard you speak about, and certainly Eddie as well talking about, um, breakdancers making great. Yes. And again, whether you knew or not, they had that neuromuscular foundation. They understood proprioception, where the ligaments, tendons, everything should work. Whereas if you had someone with a similar work capacity or someone at the same age, everything was the same, but they didn't have that neuromuscular efficiency, you'd say, okay, and again, this is me. So naively, again, I certainly don't claim to know anything about Bjj, but you go, okay, this is an arm bar.

Speaker 2:          01:21:26       This is, I think they kind of go, okay, let me try and figure this out. And you can see them. It's like a Rubik's cube. They're trying to piece it together. But you get someone again, like Brian and you go, okay, this is Bj Jay, or something quite complex that requires you and he, I'm not saying he wouldn't even fight. It's too, it's too heavy. Then I have to open up the super heavy division, but he was doing a similar movement to dead lifts, which is very common. It is. And when he's used to that movement, it is. Yeah, it is. But I suppose where you saw him, you know that wasn't actually, there was no extension of the back. He was bent over. Just repeat. There's another one again, even to use Brian is an example where he does, uh, I believe, I can't remember the name of the ward now, but he went up, um, and four as well.

Speaker 2:          01:22:09       Another strong man did a, uh, I think it was a, I might clean and jerk. There was a ward that was predominantly clean and jerk and there's this amazing crossfitter technique was beautiful, disappearing under the bar, back over his head. It was amazing to watch and I think it was thor or Brian Shaw went in and just instead of a clean and jerk and Joe, honestly, he just basically upright rows, the whole thing and complete. And they were like, well that's not clean and jerk, but you just set a record again. So there's that element. And to use an example as well with, with the, Oh, here we go. Here we go. Oh my God, it's insane. Wait, hopefully it is a crop. That is insane. Okay. There's another strongly, but there is, there's another one of those where you see the crossfit or with this amazing, beautiful technique. He's so far from his justice crazy that he's doing it like that. And what is that 225 pounds as though I don't actually know what everything from the fucking

Speaker 3:          01:23:06       shit that is so crazy that he could do that. Look at how he's doing so many reps. Right, right. That is insane. But he doesn't have a pause. No, but back he said that's meant to be a clean joke. I know. So that's what I mean about that neuro muscular efficiency that he's gone, okay, here's a new sport. Come and get involved. And he's going, okay, I see the rules of your sport, but I'm going to do it my way and it doesn't count. Well, yeah, I suppose, I mean if that word is just put the weight above your head, um, like duck, I did it normal that time right there. That's it. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:23:37       Yeah. But there's, there's, um, if you put in, you know, thor, uh, versus crossfit there, then it will probably come up and you get to see an amazing crisp technique. And then equally, um, thor is basically doing what, what Brian was doing just there. I'll you go. So this is their keep putting on weight until one of them. I believe that competition as you keep it or not. Yeah, they're your crossfit versus a mountain. It's an amazing technique. Disappears under the bar, you know, incredible. And then I think, you know, thor would eventually come in and give it a go and basically just I'm upright rows, here we go. So you saw that, you know, disappears under the bus, speed of movement. Amazing. And then all come, come and have a go at this and a, this is what he, he produces.

Speaker 3:          01:24:23       So there's that neuromuscular efficiency. There was just mad strength. It is. It is.

Speaker 5:          01:24:29       I mean, you could do that too if you just had an empty bar. You know what I mean? Like that kind of person. The kind of person that can do that. When you think about him dead lifting a thousand pounds or any of these guys who can deadlift in insane numbers, just the whole machine can generate so much force.

Speaker 2:          01:24:46       Yeah. Yeah. And that, and that's it though. It's, it is. They're able to do that again because of that foundation. They body can generate that force and then you say, here's a new movement and you can see them look like for that example of a case. So that's a clean and jerk. Okay. I can't figure that out. I think I've found a way,

Speaker 5:          01:25:06       lends credence to the concept that dead lifts is like the mother of all exercises because it really does work. All your muscle groups and if you can get really strong at dead lifts, I mean it really does enhance almost any single athletic endeavor you participate in.

Speaker 2:          01:25:20       Yeah. Yeah. And I think again, that's sort of been lost a little bit along the way that they're getting the joints, ligaments, muscles, everything to work cohesively. And when you do that for your training, you can pretty much apply to anything. So I think that's why, I mean I again, I used to swim ages ages ago, way back in the day, but I was never going to make sort of an elite standard. I'm five, nine on a good day, maybe I'm built like a hobbit. So

Speaker 3:          01:25:44       everyone else is just great grace for, yeah, so

Speaker 2:          01:25:49       I ended up, again almost accidentally going into strength training. I played water polo in the end, um, to a fairly good level. So I was doing that. But again I just got beaten up. I was 16 playing in the senior's league and you just big guys with beards just beating me up.

Speaker 5:          01:26:06       It's interesting what you were talking about earlier in terms of mental fortitude and your ability to adapt and your ability to overcome. I wonder if we're ever going to figure out a way to measure that. Like to measure in d mental endurance or measure mental capacity or mental stimulation. You know, you can measure your vo two Max and you know what the body's capable of. But I wonder if there's a way, like when someone does hear a great song and it kicks in, whether it's through Fsri or any other type of detection device where they can figure out a way, oh this part of your brain is firing, let's concentrate on building up the, the activation of that part of that brain of the brain. Like, like muscle when like, think of that endurance or think of that motivation as like maybe even a mantra that you can call upon. Cause he call upon it all the time and he can recreate that state.

Speaker 2:          01:27:03       Yeah, I mean, I think on, on that point, certainly over in Britain at the moment. So, um, uh, basically, uh, a women for the first time can actually apply and be in the special forces. So at the moment is really, really interesting because I'm speaking to you certainly the Royal Marines, they were saying, we've got hundreds of years that if you hand is 500 young fit men, we can say they need to be this weight, this tall. And if you give as them, we've got years and years of experience of putting them through this training system of mental and physical fortitude, everything down in lympstone, it's the, the, the training center of the Royal Marines. And we go on this insurance costs, we go on a 30 mile young with a backpack, everything. And by the end of 32 weeks, that's what it takes to be a royal marine to get your green baret after 32 weeks, we can take you from being completely, not sedan tree, but unfit to being a royal marine.

Speaker 2:          01:27:53       And that's one thing they pride themselves on. But now what they're saying is obviously, you know, females can apply to the special forces. And what they find so interesting is, and I certainly do as well, is what, what does that look like for a female role marine? You know, what does that look like for the themes? And again, to go back, I mean, I wrote an article ages ago, um, run like a girl and I was saying, I want to run like a girl. You know, some of them, some of my best training partners are female and they, their perception to fatigue is unbelievable. That's purely anecdotal. But also as well, when you look at the top tier of ultra marathon runners and swimming as well, Diana Niaid first to go from Florida to Cuba to Florida, you know, incredible. Like she was getting stung by Portuguese manowar's and stuff. Just unbelievable. So it's purely debts, but now the saying, you know, w why is it that that certainly my athletes have a, a greater tolerance to pain. And I think to your point, if we can start to quantify that, because there are biological differences. If you take men, high testosterone can have an impact on high hemoglobin, generate muscle force, all of these things. But, but I think if we could quantify why it is

Speaker 5:          01:29:01       that certain female athletes are dominating the top 10% of ultra marathons and an open water swimming, what is it that they're doing that would be amazing? I think the ability to endure pain, and this is not my thought, honestly, I should just say this has been theorized before, has to do with their ability to endure the pain of childbirth, child labor and childbirth. I mean just the fact that they're forcing a baby out of their vagina. Yeah. I mean that is insane. I mean, we aren't too. Have you ever seen the machine? They do. They've taken these electrodes, they put it on men and recreate the pain of childbirth Ed and watch these men funding to fall apart. Like fucking turn it off. Yeah, it's, it's, I mean obviously I haven't given birth, but it's supposed to be unbelievably painful and women are biologically suited to this.

Speaker 5:          01:29:56       This is like, so I think their ability to endure that pain is just, it's probably just, there's an evolutionary advantage to having this more higher capacity. But I also think one of the things that I learned from teaching martial arts is that women, they learned technique better many times then men do because one, they listen and two, they don't try to muscle things. So women have less of a problem with learning something from a person. And this is also true about archery. My friend John Dudley, who is an archery coach, says his favorite students are always women because they listen better. Um, they don't have as much of an ego. They don't have to pretend they already know something. They don't want to just try it without it. They follow it to a t better. Like generally, obviously we're speaking in generalities, but um, they also don't have the uh, extra muscle that a man has.

Speaker 5:          01:30:52       So men, when they're strong, we'll try to just force things, muscle things where women will try to follow what's being described to them, what's the proper technique and they do it properly all the time. And then they develop this pattern of proper technique. I noticed this with taekwondo and I think my friend John said he, oh, he noticed this with archery. I think this, this, this benefits them in sports because like if you learn Jujitsu, you really the best people to learn from our smaller men or women because they, the smaller people, they don't have the physical strength to pull it off on a big guy. So what they have to rely on is correct technique. But if you learn Jujitsu from a big guy, man, big Guy Jujitsu's weird because they could just grab your wrist and you can't get go. You can't let go and they can get away with things like, okay, you go risk control and throw the legs up.

Speaker 5:          01:31:45       Risk Control. Okay risk control on who try risk control on that big mother fucker that was rowing the world record. You ain't getting shit man. You're going to go flying through the air that was controlling it or work. Right. You're going to have to go against his strength. You're going to have to figure out a way to move around it. You don't have to go, you're not going to go through it. Right. That big guy, if he was teaching Jujitsu who I just grabbed her neck and on your squeeze he's, he's got the kind of horsepower that a man like you know a normal man can't imagine. Yeah. Do you think that's changing again to bring it back to the UFC I suppose. Cause now, I mean with what call me, he's doing and, and you know John Jones coming back then the lightweights, we're all moving up to heavyweight.

Speaker 5:          01:32:24       Do you think, you know, gone are the days of the huge dude who was just a physical phenom and now the smaller technical dues is that there's a thought with the 265 pound weight class and the consensus thought seems to be that somewhere around 240 pounds is the magic number. That's what they think. They think that 240 pounds is the amount of weight that you have where you're strong enough that you can knock out any man, right? But you have more endurance than a man that may be ways to 65 or heavier and cuts down to two 65 okay. Now this is not been substantiated. The problem is there hasn't been a really super powerful world championship athlete that weighed 265 pounds. There's been brock Lesnar, but brock Lesnar's enhanced, right? You're dealing with a guy who tested positive for steroids. He probably has had things and then this is a new world.

Speaker 5:          01:33:26       He's also 40 years old now, so it's impossible to tell what he would have been like at 30 if he was clean. And then you have guys like Francis and Ghana who was 265 pounds, massive knockout artists, natural 265 pounds but doesn't have the wrestling base got exposed and his fight with Steve Bay Meo church and you can't knock you out. He's kind of doomed and he tired out after the first round. Okay, so it's hard to say cause there's never been a 265 pound version of Cain Velasquez. Okay. Cain Velasquez, my humble opinion, when I look at all of the different heavyweights that I've personally seen, fight cane stands out as the best. The reason why Keynes stands out as the best is because he has super human endurance. Yeah. And his ability to put a pace on guys. You would see these guys just wilt under the pressure of, and I think with cane, this is where it gets really interesting.

Speaker 5:          01:34:19       What did him in is probably what also brought him to the top is his mental toughness because his body started breaking down. He started having all these back injuries. He needed back surgery, multiple back surgeries, shoulder surgery, knee surgery, everything was getting fucked up. And I think it was getting fucked up cause he was working through pain and because he has the ability to tolerate pain that most people don't have and he's just a fucking animal. But that's also probably what led to him having this insane endurance is the same kind of mental toughness. I'm sure there's some genetic advantages as well because they would talk about how he would take months off and come back still fuck everybody up because he's just that good. But then also can be attributed to the cardio base that he had from competing for many, many, many, many years at a high level and being known for that insane endurance and perception to fatigue.

Speaker 5:          01:35:12       Going back, if you could quantify that, you'd put cane up there with one of those people. He has that in abundance. Yes. Yes. Anyone else in the heavyweights then would you say your core? Me a for sure has tremendous, uh, fatigue, uh, ability to tolerate fatigue and for tremendous endurance. And he breaks people, you know, they call him the king of the grind. And, but on top of that, they, what they both have is tremendous wrestling technique. The tree, the wrestling technique as well as the endurance. Everything plays a factor. Jon Jones fits into that camp as well. Jon Jones has tremendous wrestling technique as well. Striking technique, massive physical skills, but also mental toughness. His mental toughness is an unchallengeable. You like you, you absolutely have to give it up to him. He's had his arm fucked up by Vito Belfort, completely hyper extended, refuse to tap and then went up tapping vietor with uh, with uh, uh, Americana.

Speaker 5:          01:36:04       I believe it was the next round and a toe against Chael Sonnen. Oh, I was told was fucked up and even notice it until I was interviewing him and I was interviewing him. He looked down, I like, Oh shit. Look at my toe. And he started going to shock. Was it as bad as it was turned upside down? It was completely turned upside down. I mean, imagine that. I mean if he wound up going into the next round, if he didn't stop Chael Sonnen and his toe was that fucked up and he wound up losing to chill son because his toe was bad. That's insane. Um, he also went through that fight with Alexander Gustafson where he wasn't really training very hard for that fight and Gustafson one the first couple rounds and then Jon Jones won the last two to take it away. And, and I watched that back obviously with all the promotion at the moment, and I think it was winkle, John Jackson, when he starts shouting heart hearts, you know, shout out to, and that was the, that was the design.

Speaker 5:          01:36:54       I mean that's again an, but that was the deciding factor that you come out and you produce that. Yeah. Also in Jon Jones, his favor, I believe he has to fucking super athlete brothers and they used to apparently beat the shit out of each other all the time and his brother's a bigger than him. Right. I think that is a factor because I think that there's mental toughness that comes from being around that kind of combat in the household all the time. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's a bunch of different factors, but it's, it's Ho you, I don't know. I think you can teach that. I don't believe that mental toughness is something that you either have or you don't have. I don't believe that. I think you can teach it, but you got to want it and you gotta be willing to learn. You got to be able to bring yourself to a state of mind where you're unbreakable. I think it's possible. I really do. And some people just have that that is a b. And I think they've developed it over long period of time. And once they finally got to, whether it's wrestling or Jujitsu or mma, they

Speaker 4:          01:37:56       already had it. And then they accentuated it and, and, and added onto it and then it got stronger and then they become known for it. Like that guy is just an animal. He's just mentally strong. But I think that mental strength comes from many life experiences. And probably probably the guidance of their parents or some other role model in their life that also showed them incredible endurance and incredible discipline. And this, this mental fortitude. I think you can teach it though. I think, you know, I said I don't, I don't believe that it's something that's just either have or you don't have, I think you either have it or you don't have it, but you can get it. That's what I think. I, you know, I'm a huge fan of Dan Hardee. We've been chatting since the, the swim and I always go back to that on Bob with the George Saint Pierre Ev.

Speaker 4:          01:38:43       Everybody would its hat. Oh yeah. And, and, and I couldn't get my hat and I can't wait to catch up with Dan about that and sort of exchange notes on this idea of mental fortitude because how he survived that. I mean, it was, it was, yeah, I was cringing watching. Well, Dan's a savage. I mean, he's, and he's an intelligent savage and you know, he's, um, he's not like a thug or a brutish guy. He's a very well read, intelligent, thoughtful guy. Um, but he's also a guy that knows how to dig deep, you know. And you know when he fought George Saint Pierre, that was his big shot. You know what I mean? His big shot was against a guy who was at the time was in his prime and it was the greatest welterweight arguably of all time. I mean the argument is a, it's between him, Matt Hughes and I believe now tyron Woodley isn't that camp as well.

Speaker 4:          01:39:38       It's like the greatest welterweight ever. But you, what you get out of Dan Hardy is a guy who's thought things through. I mean it really comes through in his commentary. This is a very, very intelligent guy. Would you say he's the same sort of cut from the same cloth as call me a them because I know Brendan's spoke about this recently saying he's the most intelligent fighter on the UFC roster at the moment. Carmia. Yeah. But in his approach and his approach and how he will break people button again, you know, when you watch he in a UFC embedded in and stuff like you can't help but love calling me such a nice guy. But, and this goes back to what I suppose you said about the swim, you know, when it was like, oh you're, you're, you're very smart and stuff. But I see that in call me, he's the nicest guy, but I would never get in the octagon with him.

Speaker 4:          01:40:19       He don't know fooling anyone. No, he's a sweetheart until you're locked in a cage. Fuck you up. The difference between him and Dan Hardee though is that he's a world class wrestler, right? I mean, he was a two time Olympic team member and just one of the best wrestlers to ever compete in MMA. And you really see that in a lot of his fights, like the Derrick Lewis fight. Derrick had no chance, no chance, you know, and Derek just knocked out Alexander Volkov, who in a lot of people's eyes, including mine, was one of the dark horses in the heavyweight division. But Derek just did not belong in there with Cormier who was the light heavyweight champion. And he carries a lot of fat on him. Yeah, he's mean. And I think if, if he wanted to, if Daniel cormier really dedicated himself, he could drop down to 185 pounds.

Speaker 4:          01:41:05       I really believed that. But he's just, you know, easy. Why would, he's a fucking heavyweight champion. That's the difference between him and D. There's many differences between him and Dan. The success ratio is very different. You know, courtney has been extremely successful. The only guy who lost, who is John Jones, you know, so, but, but I find that with rest, and this is on a complete tangent here, but when you talk about that mind body connection, like so often they're seen as separate. You're over an intellect or you're just a physical phenom. Like it's rare that you see the two. But when again, ancient Greek philosophy, you look at Plato, like Plato was an accomplished, celebrated wrestler. I think he said something along the lines of, you know, you should wrestle to find the answers to that. Philosophers seek. It was, it was something like that.

Speaker 4:          01:41:47       It was such an advocate of it. And, and I think, and again this is coming from a, you know, sort of my limited background because obviously in in Britain we don't have, have wrestling like over, over here and stuff, but there's something about wrestling it seems, or I suppose my question to you is like that it just teaches that like mental fortitude yeah. Physically, yeah. Neuromuscular efficiency and stuff, but it seems to just produce this breed of humans that, you know, it did you think is it's, there's something about being face down in a matter. Somebody just trying to contort your limbs, you know, so that took to go back to stress and stimulate, you know, it's also building up that progressive overload and your own head. Yes. That and what you just said there about experiences that that quite often now when I go swimming, I'm like, it's not the courier Vecan I'm not wearing the jellyfish tentacle on my face.

Speaker 4:          01:42:41       You know, it's not that bad. And I think what did do you, that's where my question is. Do you think it's the same with wrestling that you like? I've been in a worse position than this, I think for sure. I think there's the, the strength that they have, the intellectual strength and when I say intellectual strength there is actually solving puzzles and whether people understand it or not, you look at wrestling, you think, oh, it's brute force and strength and endurance, but they're solving puzzles, right? There's setting traps. They're trying to set up techniques and they're doing this under heavy workload, right? They're exhausted, their heart's pounding and they're resisting 100% with another person is resisting 100% when you see guys tie up and throwing each other around and they're fucking digging their toes into the mat and wrenching as a tremendous amount of force that they have to keep up for minutes and minutes at a time. And I think a lot of that has to do with your ability to maintain intensity. And a lot of that has to do with your ability to tolerate being exhausted and tolerate fatigue and to force yourself into an in a highly aggressive and efficient mindset and to be able to maintain proper technique under

Speaker 3:          01:43:52       fatigue. That's a good point. Technique and intelligence. I believe again with the Royal Marines, we can be a Wa when training with them. I find that it's crazy how you, you will have the cognitive functioning of a five year old, you know, you are compliant, right? You're in a 30 mile yacht with 50 kg on your backpack and somebody asks you some really complex question and your dislikes, you know, I don't know. And, and I think it's certainly going back to the swim, uh, there's times where I said to the team, I was like, please, like when, when I'm six hours into a swim through the night, I need just really clear instructions, just like raw swim this way. Ron's Rosslyn that direction. And again, purely anecdotal for the moment, but you know, I love cowboys serone and there's times when he's just in his corner and he's just having a full on comedy.

Speaker 3:          01:44:37       So relaxed, you know? And it's just like that you, you could see somebody probably fatigued and they're panicking and he's just sitting on the stool. Like he's got great deference to that. That helps. That certainly helps his ability to recover and rounds. And you see his fight this weekend, I've got to catch up on it was sensational. The best he's ever looked. But he was on the bottom when Perry can, when, yeah. I mean, Perry took him down, but he said to me, he goes, he goes, he started taking me down. I was like, Shit, I'm going to let him. He said, I'll let them take me down. And then he reversed them immediately and got him in an arm bar and, and broke his arm. He snapped his forum and half he sent me the x rays. No, I don't think anybody's seen this. I don't, sorry Donald, I'm sending us from not supposed to send us.

Speaker 5:          01:45:21       Oh Shit. Um, yeah, we'd been going back and forth and you know, for him, I think it was a matter of rekindling his excitement. Here it is. Yeah. It was a pretty emotional person. Oh, that hurts. Right. Can you see that? You want me to send it to you or I'll send it to you, Jamie? Um, also I think with Donald when it comes, we were talking about stimulation and motivation. He has a son now is a little baby son. And he brought his son into the octagon with him and celebrating with his son. He just seemed different to me. He seemed different in his poise, completely in control. The guys fighting Mike Perry is fucking dangerous. It's fucking dangerous. He hits really hard. He's very aggressive. And a donald just handled them. And, and Perry took him down I think because he didn't like what was going on standup wise. He just snapped that shit.

Speaker 3:          01:46:13       But that, but you mentioned there as well. We saw Bernie talking about his son and it was such an emotional post that he posted on instagram. And I loved it. And, and, and going back to what you said about finding something that, that alters your biochemistry, you know, and now that he's fighting for something and you know, he's, he's got his kid. Do you, did you think that's, that's what we were talking about music before. We were talking about getting his mindset. It may be use caffeine, like whatever it is, but something you think is now different in serone because again, it's love. Yeah. Yeah. The love of his children, his children, he has something that he, what

Speaker 5:          01:46:49       he said was, um, I never knew what I was fighting for. I said, now I have something to fight for. I think he was fighting for excitement before for thrills cause he's a, he's a thrill seek, you said wild motherfucker. He likes jet skiing and jump and snowmobiles off the side of mountains and he's an animal week before a fight. But yeah, he doesn't give a fuck. He doesn't, but this is a different thing. What he's doing in, in this fight in particular, I think this is a different thing because he's fighting for his son. I mean he's got this family now and it means the world to him and he looks over at this guy like this guy is trying to take food from his family and he just wasn't efficient assassin. It was just, it was beautiful to watch. It was like, I think the best performance of his career.

Speaker 5:          01:47:35       And you know, maybe Mike Perry is not as good as Darren till or is Hofeld Asan Joe's or some of the other people that he's fought in the past, but it's fucking dangerous and he's a legit welterweight were Donald's not donald can fight it 155 pounds. It's one of the things Donald said after the fight, he said, Khabib, he goes, I'm back. I'm coming for you. So he wants to drop down to one 55 and fight could be, do you think he might know something? It's different. Do you think you didn't think he could make a taller one? Well, it was a man. Khabib is the motherfuckers. All motherfuckers, you know, I mean, who's going to beat that dude? But that dude molly was aspirin maybe, but aspirin is a different weight Class C aspirins 70 and could bebes 55 if Khabib and ask an agreed to a catch line is fine.

Speaker 5:          01:48:16       That is absolutely a possibility. And absolutely a possibility that ask him could best him. Because if someone's going to beat Khabib, it's going to be someone who is a superior wrestler and ask her, and it is a mother fucker of a wrestler. But is he better than can be? We really don't know and we will not know until he, they, they fight. But I do have to say that Khabib in the training camp at Aka, this is coming straight from [inaudible] and a bunch of other people that are trained with him say that he trains with Olympic caliber wrestlers and fucks them up. That's how good could be Biz Khabib is. He is. He's so God damned good on the ground when he gets a hold of guys, they look perplexed and I always bring up the Edson Barboza fight cause a moment in the Barboza fight in the first round where he'd that thousand yard stare where Khabib had taken him down. He was mauling him and he looked over the distance like how the fuck am I going to get through three rounds of this shit?

Speaker 2:          01:49:09       Yeah. And that's the thing with Barboza. I mean Terry added that kick. He just want, yeah. So to see that it was just, I mean it felt like if I was to do mixed martial arts, did you just, I know you spoke about it before, you said if somebody doesn't know you know what they're doing like, like me, it's like drowning and, and that's exactly how I would feel. I think it was just humbling and it's something that you

Speaker 5:          01:49:37       learn. See the thing of what you've done in my eyes, what you've done is so difficult. I think you could do anything. I really do. I think what you did by forcing yourself to do that shit for six hours a day, take a break six hours again to do 12 hours of swimming everyday for five fucking months. That kind of mental fortitude, if someone just taught you, I mean you obviously you're very physically strong and fit. If someone just taught you technique and taught you how to grapple and taught you kickboxing, you would be a motherfucker at it because your mind is so strong like that, that you know, there's a different mindset to have that same kind of mind strength with the adversity of another human being. Trying to kill you. See, that's the thing. How well do people deal with other people's, like there's something about a person breathing down your neck that's trying to choke you. That's very disconcerting. But if you can get past that and I think you could, you would be a motherfucker at anything you did.

Speaker 2:          01:50:36       And that's actually the thing. I mean, even at the moment now I'm used to, uh, just training for 12 hours a day. So right now I'm still sort of in Bi phasic sleep. So I've only been on land really a week, so that's crazy. Yeah. So were you sleeping in a boat this whole time? Is Six hours. What is it like to have the ground not move the hog, the standing boom? Honestly, when I go on I was, I mean I was doing media interviews and everything was swaying like they said, but even even that night, my first night, the, the bed, it sounds so weird, but the bed was just a bit too stable. It's a bit too comfy. Wow. I woke up in the middle of the night, I was with my girlfriend and I'm looking for my goggles, you know, thinking of the time is about to change that to jump back in.

Speaker 2:          01:51:20       Wow. She's like go back to bed. And like, honestly I say it now like sort of joking, but there was a real element of, you know, just that you'd been conditioned and all I really cared about. Soon as I woke up, I want to end just to know what the tides were doing. You know, what's, where's it running? How, when does it start? When does it, how have we got good title, bad side does it spring tides or neat tie. So spring ty's been stronger, neat type spaces and that was my currency. That's all I cared about. And it was really strange that you to try now and integrate back into society. You know, even just walking through La, the cars, everything moves very fast now. You know, when you kind of come back and it's um, it's a bit of a shock. It's a real, real shit.

Speaker 5:          01:52:02       You're in an alternate universe or something like to go through five months of one reality and then to come out on the other end.

Speaker 2:          01:52:09       Yeah, it does. So what I almost, but then even it's an intrinsically or something, my body's used to work in hard for 12 hours a day and just getting battered by waves with the moment, you know, I'm sort of sitting here and I've been doing media, we can spend amazing, but there's an element of me just kind of go in, I need to use this work capacity. And so I am sort of training at the moment. The first session I did, I was in there for like six hours and hours and they were like the gym shut. He knows. And I was just like, oh, okay. Crazy.

Speaker 5:          01:52:40       There is the element. So one of the things that we all talked about after sober October was none of us had ever done anything like this before, but we're worried now that we're going to go back to our sedentary ways and then we're to lose all this work that we put in. Right. Because at the end of the month, Ari, who had never worked out before, ran 15 miles road, five kilometers, and then got on the bike for a while. I forget what he did on the bike, but I think he did at least a mile on the bike. And this was a four plus hour workout. But he had never done anything before. I mean, he had, did you Jitsu? I, uh, bought him some Jujitsu lessons. I bought him a year at 10th Planet Jiu Jitsu, like 10 years ago, but he went for a while and then he hurt his knee and stopped going. But he was 10 years of nothing and he's fucking 40 something years old and he forced himself through mental fortitude. So he's shit.

Speaker 2:          01:53:32       I mean, we're, so like the human body I find is so lazy. Like we love homeostasis. I habitual level what we're used to doing, you know, that status quo. And then so when you do shift that, and it's all relative because you know, it can be, you know, swimming for 12 hours a day and stuff. But it's relative. And I think when you do shift that, um, it is hard and I think you have to be so conscious of that. So even now are like for instance, my legs at the moment, um, you know, shrunk, but not just my legs. I mean I essentially skip leg day, you know, for 157 days, your arms must be jacked is kind of it. So we went into the gym the other day and because of the ligaments, tendons, but not only just generating force like a bench press, but if you imagine like 40 knots of wind, you know, windover tie that we were talking, my shoulders are used to being contorted in ways that they shouldn't be shoulders a resisting the winners.

Speaker 2:          01:54:30       It's coming towards me. So your exactly your shoulders. Yeah. And the amount of times I would take a stroke and then, uh, when, I mean there's times when the waves hit me so hard, I thought I've just hit a boat, you know, I hit something and that would be pointless. It was that resistance as well. So, um, on the bench press it was just kind of like took one 60, you know, I'm not saying it's necessarily just as a sort of sports science experiment. I kind of unlifted and then just took one 60 kilos just for a ride and it just kind of felt, okay, what's the one 60 kilos, what does 160 kilos in? Sorry Jamie.

Speaker 2:          01:55:05       But then equally my legs, you know, in the Scott Hunt barely lifted my own body weight, 53 53 58 reps says he, it's that, that sort of strength and muscle you had lifted weights in five months and yet your upper body. But, but, but, but lower body. No, you know, and it's not even that though. Like, you know, my legs, it's the, it's the, it's my feet as well. So right now genuinely, and a lot of people afterwards were like, what are you going to do next? You know, what's the next adventure? And I said, I've got to learn to walk again. And everyone laughed and I was like, no, no, no. Like the, the arches in my foot of collapsed, those ligaments. And so

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       it's, I mean, I think a lot of collapse just from not standing. Yeah. I mean, yeah, you got to think 12 hours in the water every day. But even when I was on the boat, I was probably eating or sleeping. Whoa. I didn't even think about that. So your load capacity, like your ability to like hold your body weight up as diminished. I almost entered into this small group of people like astronauts where you've been in a non weight bearing environment for so long. So I joke and when we watched that video back and I'll say, Oh jazz, you know, try not to fall over. They're genuinely, I was thinking, please don't just fall over with all the counter and laughing. You know the thing that intrigues me is you're a young guy, you're, you're not, a lot of these endurance guys are old angry people.

Speaker 3:          01:56:31       They get older and they develop this ability to just fucking fuck the world and, and, and push through things. How old are you? 33 yeah. That's very young to do what you did, isn't it? Yeah. And I think you're right, actually. I know that that would be a really good point to make that, that I always think when people say I'm too old now to train and stuff, I'm like absolutely no when yes, granted, when you're younger and plasticity and your ligaments, yeah. Higher Testosterone, muscle mass ability to uh, you know, increase my semesters. I've absolutely, but when you're older, and to your point there, Joe, when you look at these, you know, backing the fell running, which was talking about you get these guys who just look like they live in the mountains, you know, whether they faces, you know, their carbs are just like this just thick carves and they have that cappelary density that like mitochondrial efficiency, movement efficiency.

Speaker 3:          01:57:24       So they're cardio risk spiritually. Durrance has just been built up from years and years and, and these sorts of people as well there. They almost, they loved the mountains and, and running so much that they don't care that they're overtraining or like they need a rest. That mother Fucker, there we go. Honestly, she's crying when I'm throwing an rm getting lapped, you know, by John Nailer that that's fell running. Yeah, I run into a gay bath house. Other wasn't a short shorts, no shorts. So you get bed fell running shows you have to wear those shorts. They're not compulsory. Seems like it is. And you've got numbers next to your deck. That's where too. I would have brought you in Paris. Come on Bro. Those are, those are shorts or the girls were in a porno movie there. It makes sense, Jim and uniform. Oh, okay. I mean if he, if he's possibly Jamie, there's the um, uh, it's called the Bob Graham. So there's a famous fowl race going back to sort of the bog march. There's a famous fell raced back in England called the Bob Graham. And uh, you know, legend has it. There was a guy, Bob Graham, and he sort of said, you know, I, I, I can do 44

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       peaks in the Lake district and under 24 hours and there were an internet, that's not possible. It's not possible. I said, yeah. So it was like a bet in a pub. And they were like, yeah. And sure enough, that's what he did. And so there's this race now called the Bob Graham, and it's amazing and that it's, it's steeped in history and heritage is that there's a hall in Kazic, which is a small town. It's called Moot Hall. And if you were standing there, Joe, and you're in your running gear with those shorts, but you were running though with your running gear and you had your hand on Moot Hall and you were looking at your watch like that, runners would walk past you and just be like, oh, he's, he's about to do is Bob Graham. You know, they'd come over and there's that real solidarity, that good luck, good luck.

Speaker 2:          01:59:21       And then you have to do it in 24 hours. Um, and uh, billy bland, who was the one who, who set the record, which is only just been beaten by Kilian jewel net who uh, uh, recently ran up everest as well, but I think he, I'm fucking Saturday. Yeah. So many savages. Our base. So this, and what I love about this is, um, oh, there you go. Is that, yeah. Kilian yeah, there you go. Killing and your net. So the guy behind in the blue, um, set the record and then it says there I needed to suffer. So Kilian join net after breaking the record that it stood for 36 years, 36 years, I needed to suffer. But, but these guys and it, and it goes back to, you know, too often it's sports science, sports, nutrition. Let's look at, look at your gait analysis, running biomechanics, what footwear are using minimally shoes on and everybody.

Speaker 2:          02:00:08       Whereas with this with fell running, it took 36 years for somebody to get close to that record. Just like, wow, what were they doing so far back? Granted you need to know the terrain. Like you could on this descent, on this picture for instance, you could be running down their struggling down the rocks and you might not know that just, you know, 50 meters to your right, there's a perfect sheep trail and that's kind of the concept of, of, of fell running. So it's just a matter of getting up and above and over it no matter what path you take. Yeah, yeah. But certainly efficient if you know of something. And so that guy in the front there is pacing him basically because it's very easy to get lost on the duracell know a specific path that you have to take. They have to get over it.

Speaker 2:          02:00:47       There's certain points that you have to get through. But then in terms of the terrain and the [inaudible] no, not really. So it's just point to point to point to point. But how do they mark those points to they have a cones and we'll, I mean this, yeah, we'll be long established that to do the Bob Graham you need to do that point, that point and then you come back to moot hall, you know, within hopefully 24 hours and if you do it then you have your have your bob grounds. These guys look like a guy that would do that. Whereas you don't, right. This is my point about you and endurance, like how your physique, you don't see a guy with your physique doing this kind of stuff. You think that you could do this kind of stuff running. I mean, you know, I always say I'm not self deprecating. And how much do you think at the moment about a hundred kilos, which is a lot considering our 20. Yeah. So that's about 220 pounds. Yeah. So I, yeah, the Bob Graham is something

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       complete different than that goes back to what we were talking about about power to weight ratio in a weight bearing sports. It was something like running, cause you're so heavy. Yeah. You have a lot of power. Do you think it would be possible if you put, if you added more power to, obviously not now because you're getting off for five months on a boat, but if you built your legs and your feet back up, do you think you could do this? Yeah. And do you think this is possibly, I'm sorry, but no way near, I mean killing Jeanette. What? He's amazing. I mean with Kilian he um, I believe don't come out that he's, he's almost sort of semi nomadic. He grew up in the hills, semi nomadic. Most of for him, he would run a marathon to go and get his, you know, carton of milk in the morning.

Speaker 3:          02:02:21       Oh Geez. You know, so when you are lining up on a start line, I mean if you're racing at Kenyon, you look over and you've got a guy like that. Fuck yeah, you just, you just get a lot. I'm out, I'm out. You can't beat that guy. But he's, but he has built for that. That's my like so you, but you don't think that guy built for swimming. Like if that guy had to do what you did swimming wise, he would be at a disadvantage over a certain difference going back to the belt, right. Somebody like that. And in my experience when I've raced or swum with, you know guys who are doing in a 10 kilometer, they, they will be quicker than me over 10 kilometers. But then it gets to a point when we're like 30 kilometers in where their biomechanics just because of muscle endurance that starts to break down maybe as well.

Speaker 3:          02:03:05       And this is so often overlooked actually, but you've got to train your digestive system. So again, this is mainly anecdotal, but you know in strength based sports, you know a lot of guys won't think anything about putting away 15,000 calories a day, which is what I was doing. So I'm doing that while you were swimming? Yeah. 15,000 yeah. 15,000 calories. A lot of it. You were sitting down once you got inside the boat. Yeah. What were you eating? Just the, it was so intuitive. So it was, it was kind of strange because the diet was calorie dense so you have to make up for your category and climates that day. Also looking at nutrient dense cause you got to care for your immune system but equally palatability. So when my tongue was falling upon, you know I needed to look at that. And even seasickness you're not really spoke about it as well, which is kind of like you need something that hits those four points and that's 15,000 calories a day.

Speaker 3:          02:03:54       So for me that was quite often just like porridge oats in a mixed with honey mixed with almond butter. And then even looking at, oh here we go. Yeah. So this is a serious, what's that? Oh, there might be on there somewhere. Yeah. What is that in that bowl? Beans mostly. Yeah. And this is why I'm, it just got to the point where it was like what can you just like what he's going to say? I was just eating out of the pan. Just trying to shove it in your face. Yeah. So like what, what, what would you eat? Like what were the fool? This is probably quite a good one. Yeah, that play. So yeah, there you go. Like in terms of, so essentially as a nutritional sort of in theory, the framework you get, what was that? Mass. Oh, so that was to stop the jellyfish. Oh Jesus. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:04:38       No, but it doesn't matter. Like even the mass, cause the giant jellyfish have Scott and then there'll be a pitch on there somewhere. They're kind of like six feet long. So when you're swimming at night and you can't see them, the tentacles will, they'll just kind of, they'll get you. And so I got like, they go in your mouth and your ears. I've got one in my ear. I've got like what will lead by a jellyfish, she just kind of like got me there. So it's like that, that, yeah, there's a, the China find and adapt the same way with a mass, but nutritionally, um, as well, but also looking at as a framework, you having your protein, which is pretty stable, you know, 1.7 grams per kg of body weight per day, you know, that kind of stays the same. So then for the rest of the 15,000 calories, you basically need to make it up with your two energy yielding macronutrients.

Speaker 2:          02:05:21       So carbs and fats. And so for me it was very carb dependent because when you are swimming for a giant whirlpool, you can't say, can I have some fats, which the body has to go a certain process, it's going to take longer. No, you just need fast acting carbohydrates. But then equally, um, looking at, uh, MCTs, so a medium chain triglycerides as well, which are a fat, so they have the calorie density of a fat, but they're treated more like a carbohydrate rather than long chain triglycerides. So, um, there was a certain amount of science. There are a lot of people would say, you know, our 15,000 calories that mean pizza and everything. It was like, well, you know, yes to an extent, but then place too much emphasis on that and you're not caring for your immune system as well. So to get 15,000 calories, I think, yeah, I always point out that it's using things like mcts, which you'll find in coconut oil, and certainly, again, not to get too much on the science, but capric and caprylic acid, which are converted to ATP, Adenosine triphosphate.

Speaker 2:          02:06:17       It's a molecular energy. The muscles, when you understand how to use mcts like that, it can be quite easy to make up 15,000 calories, but you try and make up 15,000 calories of vegetables and fruit, right? Yeah, exactly. Especially you like have like protein and then fruit and it requires a different digestive enzyme and then you're going to tell me to go and swim for a giant whirlpool and roll on my stomach for 12 hours a day. It's just like with seasickness, it's not going to happen. Yeah. You just, you, you must need a lot of regret, really dense foods. Yeah. And, and that's the thing that it goes back to, again, this, this bell curve that I've spoke about, but, um, you know, quite often a lot of endurance athletes that are trained with who were amazing, they're unbelievable. They're sub three hour marathon is, they're incredible.

Speaker 2:          02:07:01       You know, they're, they're the guys that will go and run the Bob Graham, but quite often they say, but Ross can just eat. And it's just like, yeah, that's often overlooked. You know, that my body, I, you know, I didn't have a sick day for out the whole swim. That's what it was. The attribute, and I popped, I started at 92 kilos. Um, you know, when you, when you look at the pictures from the start to the finish, I just look like, just like Harrier. Yeah. But just also just bulk because you are asking your body to just swim around Great Britain. So it's not just the, that you are, you don't want to be in a calorie deficit. Can you imagine how much microtrauma the body's going to go through? So you're essentially just trying to nurse the body saying, look and know this is horrible. I know it's cold.

Speaker 2:          02:07:47       I know I'm asking you to swim for 12 hours a day. I know there's going to be jellyfish toxins. I mean, not some that off stung like in a 20 times in one night in a single tied, you know, so it got to the point where I talked about my face or changing shape. Equally, the toxins in your body, your heart would start beating faster and you know, so there was just this idea that just eat just to, to, to look after the body. So when it comes to nutrition and were you taking any supplements or you taking vitamins? Yeah, lots. And, and that goes to, like I said, that calorie density, but also to make sure that you're making some new system. Yeah. Yeah. Taking everything from super green shakes, you need to multivitamins to, to protein shakes, just to make sure that you were supplementing that calorie density.

Speaker 2:          02:08:35       I think it's so often overlooked. The higher turnover of like phytochemicals, enzymes, micronutrients. What about fish oil? Anything along those lines? Mega threes. Yeah. And that's what, just anything that you were thinking, well this is even to to glutamine to a higher turnover of amino acids. So after, uh, for instance, after training as well, you can have all the protein in the world, but if it has a, a low biological value, so I can't, I'm going to try and keep the culture. But if you look at, you know, immediately after a workout, you know, your body's basically saying, look, we need protein to repair and regrowth protein synthesis and your muscles are saying please. But if you don't have a high concentration of Leucine, specifically sub branch chain amino acids, leucine within that is what will trigger to your motor receptors to basically repair and regrow.

Speaker 2:          02:09:21       So quite often you can have all the protein in the world, but if it's of a low biological value of it's not very good quality protein, your body is not going to assimilate it. So it's not about the protein that you eat, it's about the protein you assimilate. Right. So you would take branch chain amino acids postworkout yeah, yeah. And specific. I said Leucine, just to make sure that I was kickstarted that whole recovery process because soon as you got out of the water, after six hours, there's always the temptation just I want to pass out, I want to just go to bed, I want, you know, and it's just like, no, you've got six hours to think. Because when your backend now what about your protein? What you're getting it mostly from a lot of whey protein just because of efficiency and also as well, you've got to think in terms of the boat and stocking food that like perishable, you know, food. So you know, as as much as I love my barbecue ribs and everything like that, that wasn't going to happen on this small galley that we had on the boat. Right. So you get any fresh food, eggs, anything along those lines? Yeah. When we could stop in a harbor, you know, the team would go out. I'd never touched land, but they could go and quit your provision from land and bring it back. But ultimately, yeah, it was, it was trying to find a way that was, was sustainable as possible, but within the

Speaker 3:          02:10:34       parameters that we had, you know, and that, that was what was tricky. What about your joints? I would imagine repetitive stress of swimming would wreck havoc on your shoulders. Yeah. And that's why, again, this goes back to, I suppose this goes back and I was trying to rich roll about this actually where um, one she developed that sort of horsepower program, that work capacity that was talking about before from when I ran the marathon pulling a car. It was um, Eh, this is such a strange story, but I then that again, to raise money for that, for the teenage cancer trust, I am, I climbed a rope, but I think it was a 10 meter rope. But I repeated the climate until I climbed the height of Everest. So it was a 8,000, 848 meters. And it was that that actually taught me that movement efficiency play such an important role in terms of endurance because you, you could be, you could have the best muscular endurance, the world, cartier, spiritual insurance.

Speaker 3:          02:11:30       But if you can imagine with a rope climb, if you're solely relying on your muscles, your arms, like your bicep tendon is just, you know, and then you can be the fittest guy in the world. But within that kinetic chain, something's going to give like the weakest part. Um, so you're right from that I had the, the work capacity from the marathon, then from the rope climb, I certainly understood movement efficiency. And so sort of transferring those skills over to, to swimming. I knew that you couldn't swim like a conventional swimmer. Everything that had taught you, especially in waves and everything. So I ended up developing quite a weird technique. They look really slow and comes from, I also, I almost looked to sleep, but you know, it was really rolling and that's why I asked you about swimming and even looking at, uh, uh, Bert again to use him as that.

Speaker 3:          02:12:15       But I know he does his triathlon, but for everything that is taught about swimming, it's probably for someone who looks like you know Michael Phelps or you know, an amazing specimen at swimming. So you're saying births fat. It was always saying I am silly. I'm saying that. But for the record, Jamie, for the record, I've heard it as a repeated diapers. I for the record on record, I think he's a specimen of a male. I was like well listen, we are photographic evidence. That photo of him with his belly hanging out, it's the most ridiculous is after he ran a marathon, is this pre or post as sober October cause he's really lost a lot now though. He lost 18 pounds during sober October. He's the only one that lost weight. I gained weight but there was that video cause he was dancing in his bathroom recently, wasn't it?

Speaker 3:          02:13:10       Where they look at this photo denim pants, that's not even the worst one. I love. Why is Bert Kreischer Chrysler so fat. That is, that is a fine specimen of that. That's the one that's one basie, because he wore those for the way in is he got me sober October. He has got a bunch of those. He's got more than one spot. That's what he wears. I love him. I love him more. The fact that he ran a marathon with that body that's like, yeah, running Lamont's in a pinto fit neat doesn't get enough credit. I think that's, it doesn't get enough credit Karma and everything that you have that's not real. It's not that big that's in photoshop or something. It would be the same. It'd be the same with you that if we were looking at your swimming technique, there'd be certain everything that you'd probably learn probably wouldn't be applicable to you because of how broad you are, how things that you could actually use.

Speaker 3:          02:14:06       So I was basically really engaging the lats, the traps, the larger muscles of the back. Going back to, uh, the, the video with Brian Shore when he was just ripping, yeah. Was just, or ripping out the floor and, and I knew that I couldn't necessarily do that. Looking at Delta high catch high elbows, we're going to do high elbows for 150 70 days for Tava right new. So everything that I'd learned and certainly you know, great friends of mine who are in Liam tank got 50 meter world record on a back stroke in a carry on paying double world champion 10 k. These are amazing athletes. I'm not one of them. So you developed more efficient, slower, a style that you could continue for five months and you just end up, it's like moving meditation. It just became like, you know, the limiting factor was just like I was just getting bored.

Speaker 3:          02:14:56       I wasn't actually breathing thinking of this is the thing, I mean you had to, at any given time, any tied, you had to think of something that was going to be more powerful than the thought of stopping or fatigue or clcs like getting deeper into your skin. And so sometimes it was real easy because you were swimming with dolphins, minky whales. I swam with a basking shark. Did they come over to you going, what the fuck is this dude doing? Yeah. Like one it was, yeah, there's a, it was a video of the ages ago with the, uh, the main keywell and d I was filming 12 hours across the Bristol channel, so that's kind of England to Wales. And, uh, this was, this was without doubt for all the hardship that I spoke about it. I just want to say there were some amazing moments this one particular moment swimming across the, uh, the Bristol Channel and all of a sudden minky well, kind of about as big as this table breaches right next to me.

Speaker 3:          02:15:44       I was like, Whoa, like Tom's rise. I, I turned to Matt, the captain, I was like, man, am I safe? Like what's going on? Like should I get out of the war? And he said, no, no, no, no, you're absolutely fine. And I was like, okay, cause it's a minky whales, the find the friendly. I was like, okay, fair enough. So I keep swimming and then for the next five miles, the minky whales circling me, it was breaching over the top. It was coming under me and swimming like that. I turned to him and I said, Matt, what's going on? And he said, I've never seen this. He's been sailing like 40 years. He says, I've never seen this. He said, but what I think is happening is I think it's a female, and I tried to fuck you. Well, I, I said, it's not mating season is it? He was like, no, no, no, no. It's fine. It's fine. He goes, what are these hats? Even you for later? It was one for four months in the swatter. I'm gonna fuck

Speaker 2:          02:16:30       her mating seasons probably right around the corner. She's like, if he sticks around, I know. I always like, you knew what? That was a concern of mine that was a kitchen. But no. Matt said, no, no, no. I think it's a few more. I think that she thinks that you're an injured seal five miles. She basically guided me all the way to the shallow water and as I got there, it was literally the depth of the water. Matt said, Yep. Yet much shallower water. And we turned, we were breached one more time and then, and then swim off as if to say, you know, you're safe now. Wow. Amazing. That's incredible. Amazing. Yeah. So for all of the hardship and everything that I described, there were moments and sunsets and, and swimming with seals and, and it was amazing. And also that's the basking shark.

Speaker 2:          02:17:21       Is that what you encountered? Yes. So that was in the actual one you encountered? I don't know if I can't, I mean also in behind, you could swim in that. I was, I was concerned about that one, but they didn't know. So that's a basking shark. So they're friendly. But the Mac, can you imagine seeing that? Like assuming free Scotland, not mountains, either side of you. And so, so to your point about asking what you think about, it's very easy to swim when, when you know this dolphins and everything, but there's times when you are lost in this moving meditation. But then you see something like that and you very quickly got to get your wits about you. Cause, cause they were killer whales as well, up, uh, you know, coming from sort of Iceland around the top of Scotland. So that was, that was a concern.

Speaker 2:          02:18:02       Were they interested in you? Thankfully we didn't see any, but they wouldn't attack you or anything. Well, so this is it. So we were speaking with marine biologists at the time saying, look like what's, what's the situation here? And they said, well, you know what's really interesting there? So intelligent. You know, killer whales are so intelligent and they've never been known. This was what they said to me. They've never been known in the wild to attack a human. And I said, okay, fantastic. And they said, however, if they're going to attack a human is probably going to be you because no one's ever spent that amount of time in the water as well, you know? So I was like, right. They said, all you need to do, all right, company. So they just said, look, all you need to do is make sure that you don't look like a seal.

Speaker 2:          02:18:46       Cause they might mistake you for a seal, but they might bite you. But then they will go, oh Whoa, did that, that intelligent. They'd be like, oh, that doesn't taste like a seal. So they might, you know. So I was just trying my best not to look like a seal. I think when they have attack people in the wild or toys or in captivity, it's always been trainers. Yeah. So it's been an anger, frustration. Yeah. You know, and that was my experience with the Minkwon, everything it was, people said like, how'd you swim at night? Because certainly around a west of Scotland there was, it was a debt for 200 meters. So you just, you can't, you don't know what's under you.

Speaker 2:          02:19:21       So, um, there was that element but, but I think having swum with the minky well around the Bristol Channel, I was very aware that in the hierarchy of the sea, I was very low down the pecking order and, and, and if it's comforting in any strange way, I was like, look, if I was going to be eaten, I'll be eaten in the day just as much as I'll be eaten at night. You know, it's just, it's just one of those things darkness. Yeah. Yeah. Just like you can't, you can't see the hand in front of your face. It's like the Maury first for instance, we will a 40 Mars away from land and this kind of cutting across this huge bay across the top of Scotland. And um, it was clouded over so there was not a, you can even see anything cause there was no moonlight or no stars and it was a you in that complete sensory deprivation.

Speaker 2:          02:20:07       You can hear everything and it's just, if you hear a noise, a reporter, you're like, I really hope that's not a killer whale. But then you've then got six hours to contemplate whether it, so it's this, and again, like I said, Marcus Aurelius, meditations, stoic philosophy that the conversations you have in your own head are just as powerful with other people. And I certainly found that all the way around that you just, um, there was times when you were just like, what am I doing out here? I'm like, seriously? And that comes from, I think, you know, this, this idea of you have to be doing it for the right reasons. And, and I've I again to, to bring it back to mma, I suppose it's really fascinated me. You know, some fighters in a ladelle coming out of retirement, we all tease and certainly, you know, you know, Mcgregor is made so much money, you know, what would get him back out of retirement to come and fight mayweather and, and you know, again, I've been out at sea so I didn't quite understand what was going on there with the, his kind of going over to as a Japan fighting.

Speaker 2:          02:21:03       And it's like, what does he need? He's got so much money. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:21:05       What would warrant a, whether they were the spends money, spends money like crazy. He was gonna fight tension, tension. How do you pronounce his last name correctly? Not Sue Cowell. No. So I've been at a seat, so I didn't really see what was going on here. Yeah. Let me see if you find that on my instagram. He's out of his fucking mind. Would that have been a bad idea? Horrible. He would get head kicked into a coma. But you, but you kind of ask like what? What, what are the reasons? And I think, okay, I think he spends a shit ton of money. You think they're trying to get it back on track? I said floyd had been duped into agreeing to the contest. Look, they will do him. By the way, they are very different if those, if this happens, believe you me, he's going to get kicked in the head. They're going to, they might say, no, no Kiki, no Kiki, listen man, you get in the ring with tension. He's going to try to roundhouse kick you into another fucking dimension. So it was, it was a special bounce. So there's gonna be no kicking. I don't know if they agreed to the rules. Wow. Okay. But tension not Sukarno was, I think he's 20, I think he's 20 years old. He's a really fantastic talent. Wow. Yeah. I mean, he really is,

Speaker 2:          02:22:22       but it, but it fascinates me. So I'm catching up on all this. Like I said, so I've, I've missed

Speaker 4:          02:22:26       all of this for 157. They'd look sad. I even missed the mcgregor and [inaudible] and stuff. Go do a striking breakdowns on instagram. Lawrence tension has a, he's done a bunch of breakdowns as is Brendan Dorm has done a bunch of breakdowns to on tension, but, uh, he's, Lawrence Kenshin has this really fascinating video of him fighting this world Moitai champion. And uh, he wheel kicks him in the head, was more like a jump, spinning back kick to the chin. But the way he did it, it was like a really weird angle and you could see them setting it up. He's really creative and he just found like a weird opening a for this guy and just kick this guy into oblivion. Right. He's, he's nasty. And he's really sneaky, like the kind of techniques that he lands. It's very clever with his reads and his understanding of distance and in what's possible. Right. Do you see it striking breakdowns on, on instagram?

Speaker 1:          02:23:22       Might not be the name of it. Huh?

Speaker 4:          02:23:25       But yeah, it's with this, you know, how much money does he need? He can call on spend that much. That's a good question. I think he can, but, and this is what I love. Again, I'm only just catching up on this, like set out you, I should point out I have been at sea for 157 days, but with everything that happened was treating breakdowns. No, on that. I just got to it. Striking breakdowns.

Speaker 1:          02:23:50       Good. What? I typed it, man. Start coming out. Nope.

Speaker 4:          02:23:56       Maybe there's something wrong with instagram.

Speaker 1:          02:24:02       Hmm. I Dunno.

Speaker 4:          02:24:04       I got it right here. Here. I'll send you the link. Okay, so we could see a,

Speaker 1:          02:24:10       yeah, here we go. I'll send you this. They're toppy link. Sorry folks.

Speaker 4:          02:24:20       But this is a, I don't know how much they were offering him, you know, so I don't know how much I'm okay. I just sent it to you. I don't know. I mean it has to be millions of dollars. That's the only way he'd be willing to do it. But if they offer, and he also, tension is quite a bit smaller. I think he weighs one 30 and floyd walks around, I mean he's fought at one 54 one 50 ish and mcgregor was at 55 mm is this, this kid is fucking nasty man. But he does a lot of wild shit. Like there's a, there's a video here or the see him fight this Moy Thai guy and he hits them with this crazy. That's when he was a little kid. Like see how he does shit like that. Like sneaky shit under the sip, sip and it, he was young.

Speaker 4:          02:25:10       He was this, we got this crank. Oh this is the one with the World Moy Thai champion. Boom. Puts that due to sleep but the way set it up. That's a weird angle for that kick. Very tight. Yeah, very tight clothes. And it wasn't around. It was straight. So it was basically like a jump, spinning back kick to the chin, which is hard to generate force. Oh No, no, no, no, no. This power. Yeah. No, as long as he can get extension on his legs, it's just he had to jump and talk and spin. But the fact that he chose that angle, it's like he realized that the guy was going to see things that were coming around. So instead of coming around, he had it come up and, and through the middle, which is, which made it much sneakier but that's it.

Speaker 2:          02:25:58       What we're describing now is it never intangible, right. Creativity. Yeah, exactly. I mean, I, I'm what I find it so interesting when, you know Mcgregor Diaz and I was just say I'm a huge fan of Ido, poor towel. So when they use their own, but I was just like, look, and I think it was, um, I think mcgregor was on, I want to say Kimmel, but I don't think it was, he was on a chat show and he was talking about that spinning cap aware, a crescent kick. And he actually did it. He performed it. And I was like, look, if he lands that, you know, the same way with Aldo, it's be like that is the movement is it, you know, you can forget cardiorespiratory endurance, strength, everything that we talked about that the metric saying, you know, heavy where you gotta be two, four, five, you know, whatever. No, it's just movement. He would have reinvented and again more and I could be wrong. I think we do yet he did try it, didn't it? And it missed I think,

Speaker 4:          02:26:50       I believe he did look through it through it. I think he threw it. The thing, you know, that technique is a legit technique. Obviously we'll kicks most certainly work, but it's not a high percentage technique doesn't, there's only been a few. We'll kick knockouts in in the UFC. The first one was Edson Barboza over Terry. Adam. That was number one. There's been a few since then. Uh, Vitor Belfort shocked Luke rockhold with the wheel kick. It's, it's happened before. Right? Um, but it's just not a high percentage kick and it's usually a kick that's, you know, it's

Speaker 2:          02:27:23       nowhere. You don't expect it. Right. But that's a bit, but can you tell when someone has it and doesn't cause it's an intangible. So if you said if it there started the Barboza and atom fight, you said, you know, knock out by timing or creativity you'd st like why would you mean? You know, but if you could foresee that the same way that you could quantify that sort of mental fortitude. I think you start opening the door in sports performance into something that's just this whole other realm that you don't talk about weight as a metric. Strength, cardiorespiratory endurance. You can start talking you. Is that hard to see again? Take well yeah, with creativity, especially in regards to striking technique. Yeah, that's,

Speaker 4:          02:28:04       that's a crazy intangible because you're essentially deciding when to move and what to do, right? Like you can throw a jab, you throw a front kick, you could throw a roundhouse kick, you could throw a wheel kick and you throw a turning side kick. You could throw an ax kick if you're crazy, you know, and this is a lot of different things you can do. So do you decide to do and why do you say to do it? Is it because you have a style like some people style is like conor likes to hop in and out and he throws like a little front leg sidekick. He throws like that for movement. He likes to keep his arms wide. It makes his tennis sideways stance. Some guys like to hold up like this and the Moitai Shell and they move forward lifting the front leg up and they move forward and, and challenge with leg kicks and striking technique.

Speaker 4:          02:28:44       Some guys just like to wrestle. They, they'll, they'll pour at you and they look to shoot like Ben Aspirin, you know, he's not looking to stand up and strike with anybody. He's looking at taking the ground beat the fuck out of you. That's what he does. So it's all, and what do you decide to do and why do you decide to do it and when do you decide to do it? When do you engage? You know you're throwing some faints, you know, you don't want to be the guy who makes it obvious that you moving forward. Cause then like connor clipped Aldo, you get rocked. You know it's a, it's a crazy, crazy sport is, but you, if you enter into that realm and even start applying more sweats again, we talked about that sort of strength deficit as well. That if you get someone um, you know, trying to like, like John Jones who, you know, move up to heavyweight, is it going to be, will it benefit him winning with strength training for instance, I can't remember.

Speaker 4:          02:29:30       He's dead lift, but it's pretty impressive. It's an impressive, I think it was 600 pounds. Big Dead Lift. Yeah. So when you look at that strength deficit, Jon Jones, very lean, was using neuro muscular. He was recruiting voluntarily, all of those muscle fibers. It was unbelievable. But if it means that to it, it would it be, would any more muscle mass be functional? And I think when you start the question looking at when should he do that? That's another good question because you're beating your body up to do that. Yeah. And is that conducive with a high aerobic capacity training, like multiple rounds of sparring and bag work and pad work, and you're all the lower back muscles that are getting stressed. And does that lead to potential injuries? Is the potentially damaging his discs, his knees, like there's a lot of a lot of things to be considered.

Speaker 4:          02:30:17       And when should you do that? A lot of people that you think you should do that when you're nowhere near camp. Yeah. Yeah. Like you win a fight and then you decide to, to build up in between camps. Yeah. And I think that's so awful. Even a Darren till, you know, who is a huge, huge, huge currently, but he's moving to middleweight and now, yes. Yeah. He's missed weight and his title shot against Tyron Woodley and then he got rocked put away. So if you're moving up, how do you do it? Do you do it intelligently? Do you? Yeah. But then there are guys who were just like, they say training is the real realization of one's genetic potential. And when you get someone like, you know, rumble Johnson, it's just, you know, now you never met. He fought well tomorrow he made, wait, I'm sorry. He made weight against Tyron Woodley, didn't he? Yes. He made waves with it. He didn't make weight against Donald terrone. Right. That's what it was. He came in very heavy and sounds around him. He's a big motherfuckers. What he is, you know what I mean? He's so big for welterweight. I think you'll be way better off at 185 pounds. But I think many of them will.

Speaker 3:          02:31:20       I think there's a point of diminishing returns where they are significantly depleting themselves to make that weight. And then when they don't have to do that, they have more energy. And we've seen that time and time again. Exactly. But when you did rumble Johnson, he fought at welter weight. Right? He's so big like gone and then all of a sudden mood a mood and then, you know, it was, it no guerra. I mean nowhere. Yeah. Oh my God. When he just bounced the fight. Heavyweight, he did fight heavyweight successfully in, in um, the Pfl he not, he broke Andrea Orlowski his jaw. He fucked Andrea Lawsky up as a heavyweight. Right. And that's what always fascinates me is that, and I suppose when I see this, that God given kind of power yeah. For all of the training it seems, and it was someone like, yeah. Johnson and he, cause he said, am I right thinking he said he's going to come back for heavyweight if DC and Jones go up.

Speaker 3:          02:32:12       He's thought about it. Um, you know, I think he's, uh, he's in the weed game right now. It's making some money selling weed, which is legal now. So He's, he's doing that. What? Wow. Right. Because the size of him now. But he fought hardy, right? Yes. He fought hardy and um, he took him down, which was interesting. He didn't want to stand with them. Wow. Back in the day it was a different thing. I mean, they kind of made an agreement to stand with each other and then he was like, bitch. And he took him down and he won by decision, but that was a different rumble. Johnson, I think the rumble Johnson at one 70, he had no fucking energy. He was on death's door. He was just always exhausted. He would lose fights. He just, he got choked out by Josh Koscheck. He was just too tired.

Speaker 3:          02:32:55       And I think, wait king as well, obviously, you know, there's been certain changes now, but even now, and I love Max Holloway, but, uh, uh, I think it was ufc embedded where they flew his favorite cupcake's over from Hawaii and he was like, yeah, I love cupcakes. I've made weight. And then he was just, you know, nailing cupcakes. Smart. No, and I think there's just that element now that, that I think as much as MMA has, has evolved, and, and again, this is someone who doesn't understand the technical aspects, but as someone who loves, uh, kind of sports history, you know, and I've watched it and I'm just like, that is amazing. But it's still got so far to get. Again, we were talking earlier about, you know, football or soccer isn't in here back in England and the warming up of the brandy, you know, in the, in the changing rooms, I think even now it's crazy when you have someone so gifted like that, but they are rehydrating and re carb loading on cupcakes. It's, it's like, yeah, there are better, there's way better ways you've caught weight. Your body is basically in fight or flight, you know, you've subjected it to a form of micro trauma, you know, bodies kind of sitting there going, Whoa, is going on and um, then you're going to get Hago he loves a cupcake. She made weight. Yeah. Yeah. So I find that really interesting that you see some of the guys who, you know, was it [inaudible] tobacco? Isn't it, who

Speaker 2:          02:34:18       just like, it was so big. It was, he got into, it was like he said that he'd weigh in and then it would be like he sent his older brother in like they were unrecognizable. Um, and, and, and I think it's really interesting that, that physiological puppetry, if you know how to do it intelligently, it can be so powerful, but you do it for the wrong reasons,

Speaker 4:          02:34:37       but even if you know how to do it intelligently, there's still a demand that it places on your organs. That's, it's there's consequences, right? And over time your body resists it. And this was the thought behind Max Holloway's last weight cutting fail, is that when he was trying to cut down on short notice to fight Khabib Namaka Madoff, he was cutting down only to one 55 and he couldn't make it. And they pulled him out of that. And then he started suffering some significant problems when he was getting ready for Brian Ortega. And they think that when he was ready for getting ready for a Tayga, what was going on was his body was reacting to the fact that he was trying to cut weight again. And it was like, fuck you, we just got through this man. Right. You know, and he was like really messed up because of it.

Speaker 4:          02:35:22       Right. And he had to go through a battery of tests before they approved him to fight again. So his body had to like fully fully recover months off and then get back to training and now he's okay again. But, but I think it's changing. I mean now, I mean Frankie Edgar was almost the fest. He would wake, you have to fight like five pounds. He wouldn't even cut weight. He wouldn't cut any weight. Yeah, that was his way. Well there, this is what they say, Frankie, although was the 155 pound champion and now competes at 145 pounds. Really? He should be fighting at one 35 and then one 35 is where he could be at his best. That's what everybody says. Wow. Especially people that know like weight cutting and they look at what he walks around and like, look, 20 pounds from 55 ain't shit. You know those guys do it all the time. Especially you get a guy like a George Lockhart who really knows how to do it and put that weight back on you, you know, and how to do it correctly. Scientifically,

Speaker 2:          02:36:16       it's a big W we're seeing that now across all sports. I think this evolution that we're understanding, I skin Carlin aisles, he's one of my favorite. So he was a, a good American sprinter. He was, I believe, you know, top 50 you know, he was, he was amazing, but it wasn't quite making it, you know, he's not a Usain bolt, he's not adjusting Gatlin. So they just said, Hey Colin, here's a, here's a rugby ball. And again, it'll be on youtube some ways like, you know, why do you regard as the fastest route comply? They just handed him, you know, and now there's one of my favorite clips because he, it was one of his first games or something and I think it was an Australian commentator and he just ran like rings around everybody. Scott as score to try. And then the commentator was like, was, oh my God, it goes, I cannot believe this. Can you believe? Here we go, look, here we go. Here's the ball.

Speaker 7:          02:37:04       Oh my God, look at him. Go Goodbye. That is insane. This is rugby sevens. Oh my God, they're all quitting. But like, look, the guy chasing gave

Speaker 3:          02:37:16       that guy, there's more, this is absurd. I love corners. And, and he ran past him like the guy was ahead of them. This new law, I'm not even going to sites that you because I don't, he, it's like he doesn't even respect their speed. Look how much faster he is in those guys. That's hilarious. Was that all in many ways, right? Isn't it like that other guy who broke the world record by rowing and he'd been doing something else and gotten so much power and energy in his body that he could translate that to, to rowing. And we're seeing that now, but, and that was what was amazing there with we call him. I was, like I said, he scored her, he's got to try. And then the commentator, there was two commentators talking and said, I can't believe he's only been playing in a number of months, and that they were like, yeah, no, that's amazing.

Speaker 3:          02:37:59       And then the other commentary you said, no, no, no, I can believe it. He's just tried to give the referee the ball and he didn't know what to do. He'd scored a try and he was walking around and he gave it to him. No, no, no. You know, kick it. You know, it was amazing. They didn't bother teaching them. They're like, just listen man. Just run. But what do I do when I get to the, I just get to the end and then we'll talk and I'll tell you what to do. It'll take about three minutes. They do. They do. And you just run baby. You're seeing it. And I think it's incredible. You spoke about this not too long ago, but I think you might've mentioned Lebron James saying if someone like that, I was taught mma. Oh my God, everybody would be dead. What would happen? And I think we're seeing that now that you know, sports now there's more money, you know, in mma and it's evolved to what it is now. It's amazing that if you get, you know, some unbelievable phenom as a kid, you go go into mma. Yeah. But it's not as

Speaker 5:          02:38:51       peeler is basketball and it doesn't pay as much money as Lebron James makes. Lebron James, what does he make? $100 million a year, something crazy just from basketball. It's like 35 or so, 35 million just from basketball. And then sponsorships, like unless you're conor Mcgregor, floyd mayweather, you're not gonna make that much money from fighting. They can make that much money from fighting, but they're so rare. And then connor could only make that much money from fighting if he box floyd. Like even though the fight with Kobi was the number one mma paper view of all time, the number two paper view in the history of paper views just behind a floyd mayweather versus Manny Pacquiao. Right. It got more paper view bys then floyd mayweather versus conor Mcgregor, I believe. I believe that's true. Wow. Look that up. I think it was 2.2 million for floyd mayweather versus conor Mcgregor and then 2.4 million for floyd mayweather versus Khabib neurohacker grumet off. I think it was number two of all time. Why? Just behind the floyd mayweather or manny Pacquiao fight, which is just incredible. So they must've made a shit ton of money from that. But how many times can connor do that? Don't, you know, I mean look, the Irish support him, but people thought he had a chance of winning that fight and then once he gets smashed like that, I don't think they're

Speaker 2:          02:40:13       going to think he has a chance of winning again unless he does something significant. Right, right. Yeah. He has to beat somebody like he has to fight like Kevin Lee and fuck him up. You know, if you fought Kevin Lee or Tony Ferguson and fucked him up and then you know, said look, I had two years off, I wasn't ready for could be, but I'm ready now. Fuck the mayweathers and he said something like that. People, he's got to have some success though.

Speaker 8:          02:40:38       Floyd Connor was 6.7 million. Floyd manny was 4.4 million and then it would have been right around the next one, which has been Oscar and floyd, which is 2.4 so he has to say 2.5 2.4 so I've been right around number. So it was number three then number three overall, number one, mma,

Speaker 2:          02:40:54       number one mma. But number three overall it could be tied. So what would the one of the boxing numbers again,

Speaker 8:          02:40:59       what was it, 6.7 for the floyd conner, 4.4 for floyd. Manny.

Speaker 2:          02:41:04       Wow. That is so crazy. 6.7 for floyd connor wide. My numbers off big time. But the amount of money that that will it, it's so interesting that you know, with that phone around this kind of extrinsic motivation, money, media fame versus intrinsic motivation. And, and in a, in a strange way with the swim, you know, when we got around John Groups at the top, it was a, everyone was like, yeah, yeah, you just set the land's end to John O'groats record, well done. And those cameras. And it was amazing. And then I was just swimming across the Murray firth getting hit by jellyfish in, you know, six degree water. It was just horrible. And, and, and I think, I think right now as well, and Khabib fascinates me that, you know, and I don't know the logistics again, you know, I've been at sea so I'm still trying to catch up, but he was offered so much money for the rematch, but I believe he turned it down.

Speaker 2:          02:41:55       It could be no, there was talk of a rematch, but the UFC did not offer him. Right. Financial. Some of those rumors, they hadn't even talked, they were trying to figure out what to do next. And in fact the UFC said that most likely next was Tony Ferguson. Okay. Okay. So that's, that's the current, the last time they talked about someone fighting for the title again, but it was a while ago now again, it might be UFC embedded when I, and I think it was when, could be years ago now, met George Saint Pierre and could be, you know, said, oh I'd lovely to meet you and then just, and then it could be with smiling and he said, Oh, you know, my dad has always said that he'd love to see me fight George St Pierre. And for me that was really interesting because it could be some motivation seems to be intrinsic and putting his skills against the best people in the world.

Speaker 2:          02:42:43       You could offer more than money in the world, but he just wants to do something. When he talks about his dad, his family, and it's a different beast. And that's what I find really interesting. That, but, but, but I'm not saying different as in better, worse, good or bad, because ultimately mayweather's never lost. But when you see someone like mayweather, you think easy, just an extrinsically motivated. When he's saying it, if it doesn't make money, it doesn't make sense. You kind of look at him going, well, you're extrinsically motivated, arguably. And I don't know, I've

Speaker 4:          02:43:12       never met the guy and stuff. But you, you're, you're extrinsic motivator but you'd never lost. So which one's more powerful? I don't think he's completely extrinsically motivated. I think that's a lot of it is an act. Do you think he's too good, too good? There's, I mean, there, there has to be some, some deep emotional connection to his work. There's gotta be some connection to his legacy. What he's been able to do the way he's been able to retire undefeated as a professional boxer, which is almost unheard of. Right. Cause I want to believe that. And I hope that's true because, because you're almost taught like intrinsic motivation did it for the love, you know, in sort of unit the sweet science. I want to believe that may wave is there and he's studying it. If it may be, he doesn't want you to see that side.

Speaker 4:          02:43:55       He's too good. Right. He's too good. He's kind of have a love of boxing. There's no way he's too good the way he, he's artistically taking guys apart. Like you go to the Canelo Alvarez fight. The way he was like it was slipping away from Canelo was big shots and then popping them with the jabs like pitch. Yeah. Not Today. Not Today man. Good enough for this. And it was intelligent in his approach to that fight too cause he made canelo drain himself to get down to 150 pounds. Right, right. That was a different thing cause he forced Canelo to cut a lot of weight to get down to his weight class. But it'd been, floyd really realistically is 147 pound fighter. I mean he's only fighting in these higher weight classes cause the money's there. It's a fucking wizard man. He's a wizard. But that's what I mean about like that that will start, you know, he's playing with everybody's head.

Speaker 4:          02:44:45       You talk about like psychological warfare, you know, the art of war and everything like that. And he's doing it on a mass scale like we've probably never experienced before. Well, what was fascinating was connor was doing it to him and was screaming in his face with a hard on, by the way, at the way in. So I don't know how he generated a harder one, but uh, you know, he must have played with his deck before he got out there. It took some Viagra or something. I really think that might've been part of the psychological motivations that just screaming in his face, I'm gonna fucking kill you a little puke you piece of shit. And flow is just like this, just dead face staring at them. Right. Didn't scream back dead face stayed comms like tomorrow I am going to fuck you up and there ain't no god damn thing in the world.

Speaker 4:          02:45:27       It's going to change there. Right, right. Well Connor was like the first guy that floyd ever fought that could fuck him up in a real fight though. Right. That was the, there was a different element of danger there because there was an agreed upon rule set where connor wasn't going to kick, wasn't going to take them down. What's going to strangle them. So because of that, floyd knew he could win, but he also knew without a doubt, if they were just going to fight, fight. If there was no gloves, if they just put the gloves aside and just had a street fight, connor would fucking kill him. I mean there's not a question on my mind is not that not, there's not a doubt to be had. Connor would kick him from a distance. He would probe him with

Speaker 5:          02:46:10       front kicks, kick his legs, floyd would start to limp. Connor would step in, tie him up, elbow him, take him down, smash his face into a bloody pulp, do whatever you want it to him, strangle him, rip his knees apart with leg locks. You can do whatever he want it to them. If they were going to just fight, fight, you know. And he said that to him and he's like, if this was a fight at fucking kill you, he just looked right at him. And he's saying that to him. Floyd had to just eat it, but it didn't matter because it wasn't a fight. It was a boxing match and he didn't have a chance.

Speaker 2:          02:46:40       But do you think that worked with Aldo for instance? Because, and again, this is me kind of just talking more on the, the mental warfare side and not really understanding the technical aspect. But that world tour was fascinating to watch and the whole way round. And, and again, um, this is me not understanding all that much about him and maybe being fascinated with a mental aspect that, uh, and again, George Saint Pierre, when he fought Nick Diaz and, and they were saying, you know, we're going to, he's going to talk to you and he's going to talk to you. He's going to walk you down. Don't be effected. And George St Pierre, was that across? Yeah, I won't be. And then he was talking so much that I even said it just invoked again, actually going back to what we were talking about, you know, our bodies, as much as we like to think about it as black and white, the complex biochemical organisms. So when I, and I'm not saying that, you know, the Diaz brothers necessarily think like that, but they, but I'm going to talk to you and I'm going to mess with your mechanic. Do you know the, the chemical reactions within your body neurotransmitters and making you fought

Speaker 5:          02:47:37       the mind? Fuck you. They're doing it for sure. They're dumb. They're not stupid. When Nick's doing that too, he's like, what bitch? Which going to a bitch? He's fucking with your head, man. I remember the first time he did that to Robbie lawler. Robbie was like 2021 years old and nick was young too, and they're both standing to the, they moved into the cage and they closed it and nick has just started saying, stockton motherfucker, Stoughton bribee Laura was like, what? And he's like standing in front of them. That's against Carlos condit. He drops the best one was against Anderson Silva. He fell to the ground and pretended he was sleeping. He put his hands together like he's taking a nap and laid down and I couldn't stop laughing. I was like, this mother fucker is so crazy. He just like right there, drop down instead of relaxing, go to the back, go back. That one's better. Yeah. So when you see him lay down and leaned on his head like, I'm just going to take a nap here. Like what are you doing bitch? Anderson Silva did forrest Griffin and has done all his career, but he's doing this to a guy who's the 187 85 pound rather best ever. Right. And he's not even 185 pounder. He's really a one 55 pounder. I mean, Nick Diaz, when he was a champion in strike force or lead xc lead XC, right. He was a 155 pound champion.

Speaker 2:          02:48:55       Well, what's amazing here is everything that we talked about in terms of intangibles, mind, body connection. Nick is imposing his mind, body connection on Anderson in that he's going to, I'm going to mess with y'all fucking with head for sure. What

Speaker 4:          02:49:08       will, was he the champ? Why am I not remembering it? Was it elite Xc or strike force that Nick Diaz was the champion of? It might've been strike force.

Speaker 1:          02:49:17       Okay.

Speaker 4:          02:49:18       Why can't I remember? Sorry. Yeah, why? Well, why did I think a leader Xc, see, no, he, I'll use the fought elite xc. Did he? Oh, okay. Now I remember because,

Speaker 1:          02:49:30       okay.

Speaker 4:          02:49:31       That was because mayhem Miller and uh,

Speaker 4:          02:49:37       jake shields had a brawl in elite xc and Nick Diaz was a part of the brawl. They're all piled on each other and that was chaos. But Stripe, that was him pull daily, that knock out. But also just kind of like fell and, and uh, so it's, it's so strange that this intangible, this thing that I'm now fascinated. We've liked men, Kj noons elite XC. So he did fight him in a next, see? That's right. So he finally Dixie and then became strikeforce champion. That's why I'm confused. Wow. Yeah. Um, that whatever mayweather did differently to Aldo might have been granted different sports granted, but there was something that mcgregor was like, it's not working the way that when he pinched, you know, de has neck and shoulder, I turn around and you know, again, without understanding the technical element there was, for me, it was so fascinating watching the two.

Speaker 4:          02:50:29       And like you said, mayweather stood there completely stoic Aldo was not comfortable with it and he lost his composure and he attacked, he attacked connor in a way that exposed him. He, he got exposed to a counter shot. He was, he wasn't patient. He was very emotional and he just wanted to fuck that dude up and he just got clipped. Right, right. You know, and look, connor played in perfectly played them like a fiddle. Yeah. Yeah. Hey Man, I've got to wrap this up. It's already five buck. We just went three hours. Believe it or not. No, don't be sorry. It was awesome. I really appreciate it. And uh, what you did is beyond impressive man. I mean, it's fascinating stuff and I feel like we could do a hundred of these kinds of conversations. Don't so sorry. I'll often even in Los Angeles. Uh, no, this is my first time. Oh, we'll come back and visit again, man. Next time you gonna to swim to the moon,

Speaker 3:          02:51:22       let me know. This is here. I honestly like next time we'll get, we'll get burton again for the record. He's an amazing physical specimen of a fat guy. Right. We'll go swimming or like, okay, we'll do something. We'll, let's, let's definitely do another podcast. That's be amazing. Thank you. So really, really, really appreciate it. Thank you. Alright. Oh, tell people who your social media, how did it get to you? Oh bless. Yeah. Um, so yeah, instagram, just a raw sedgley spell please. Yeah, I know it gets difficult. R o. S. S. E. D. G. L. E. Y.

Speaker 1:          02:52:00       folks. That's it for today. Bye.

Speaker 4:          02:52:14       Okay.
