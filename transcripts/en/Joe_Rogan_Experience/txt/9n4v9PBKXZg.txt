Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Natasha luxury rogue drinking healthy green juice. Oh, I drink. That's tough. That's tough. Is Yummy. It's good for you. Look at you all healthy and shit. I mean, doing yoga, drinking juice. I mean, I also smoked pot and drank and those are good things at all. Yeah. It's like who said that? Oliver Wilde, all things in moderation, including moderation. Oscar Wilde. Was it? Yes, I was at right. That's Oliver Wilde. Did I say 1130 my brand is useless till about 3:00 PM I made you come earlier. Say overwhelmed. Yeah. Well I've been up. I've been up. I got up early today. You got kids? Yeah, kids. But I went to Yoga class. Oh, you went today? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Eight o'clock class. They have like 5:00 AM classes. I'm like, who's taking a five amp crim class? I know. I kind of want to go. Just fucking Weirdos that I'm like, who is getting up at 5:00 AM for an 90 minute class and where I live, they pump up the heat too much.

Speaker 1:          00:01:06       They had this like, they have this sort of vibe of like they want to torture you. You know, it's an ordeal. You're getting through an ordeal. It's way more difficult than anybody thinks it is. Like you drive by these little fucking boxes, these rooms, and nobody knows the kind of punishment that's going on in those places. Everybody thinks it's like a bunch of housewives, like stretching and holding onto their toes. Chowder is raping his students and they're all getting $12 an hour to like teach us nothing to teach us. And he's been, I think accused of rape 17 times. Well, let's Google it. It's more than one. Certainly that's an issue, right? Whenever, I mean, if one person says, hey, Jamie, the sexual encounter we had was unpleasant for me. I think you may be a rapist. I'm calling the fucking cops. That's, you know, there's some wiggle room there.

Speaker 1:          00:02:05       But when it's more the hotline numbers, those are big numbers, big numbers. It's so hard to get 30 people to agree to law unless they're working for the CIA or something. How many people has he a new cases filed February 13th bringing the total number of civil lawsuits, civil lawsuits. What does that mean? What about criminal? Uh, okay. It says claims he raped her during the 2010 teacher training or five other allegations span over two years, including another rape charge from, it's always depressing when it's the people who are like the spiritual leaders. Super Common. I know anytime you try to repress things, but I mean I don't even, I mean he's allowed to have sex, right. Allowed to like use their dicks as weapons. What about Pat Benatar? What does she is as a weapon? A weapon that I'd see. I think it's different. One woman when live on music, I'm sorry.

Speaker 1:          00:03:07       I really do. Because men have the upper body strength and they had this thing specifically have upper body strength. Look at you and then you had this thing that gets hard and then it inserts right into the woman as an act of violence. It's very rude and seemed convenient and golfing, golfing and penetrating are two completely different things, right? Because the woman and Golfs, but she can't, she's not the aggressor. She's receptive. If someone grabs your finger and starts sucking it, come on, man, what are you doing on my finger? It's not that big a deal, but if someone grabs their finger and stuffs it in your mouth, you're like, whoa, that's kind of fucked up. It's different. Although there is female rape, I watched a documentary on it. Oh yeah, there is

Speaker 2:          00:03:51       women. You know what they do though? They the rape other women and they get on their face so a woman will sit on the other woman's face so she can't breathe and like get off.

Speaker 1:          00:04:02       Hmm. And I think that's what I saw it on Netflix. Well female rape. I think we would have to look at each of those on an individual basis. I mean I wouldn't want some woman to force her pussy on my face. That's what I'm saying. That as one aggressive lesbian. The problem is, I think there's probably some women that like a little of that, probably some like, look, there's all sorts of sexual appetites and I know there's guys I know guys don't like to be smacked around and tied up. I have a friend who likes doing that fucking weird shit.

Speaker 2:          00:04:36       Oh yeah. I used to work for a dominatrix. I wasn't like working for her as a Dominatrix, but she, I worked in her clothing store and she was also a Dominatrix, this German woman and she would go piss on people. She would just like, it was so funny and she had this crazy accent and she'd answer, you know, one line she was ordering, you know, fabric and then the other line she's like, what are you into? Do you want me to jog around the block? You want my feet smelly? She always like, and then she had a guy who had like his thing, she would tell me about it all. She had a guy who all he wanted to do, she had to wear white underwear and he just wanted to use a flashlight and look up her skirt for like an hour. She would get paid so much. At one time I went over to her house to get paid and she had a man blind folded on the floor crawling and he was just smelling her boots while she was writing me a check. I mean it was, it never ended. It was so funny.

Speaker 1:          00:05:26       But that's all voluntary. So that's where it gets weird. It's like they're paying, they're paying and they want to do it. It's like that's their thing. It's like I just did a girl who liked to get choked. That was her thing. She so I didn't, I don't like doing that. I don't want well cause you're still strong. It's one thing when you ask them emo guide a chunk or some like scared dude. But when you asked him guy who like clearly could strangle you, maybe it only with 10% of your strength. I use good technique. I know what I'm doing. But

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       I didn't, I don't, I don't, I don't want to connect. I never wanted to connect those two things together. Like I'm not in the sex violence, but it's not. And um, I don't, I think you could get into anything. And when I was in high school, I've talked about this before, I had this girl that used to like rub my dick where their feet and I had a foot fetish for a little bit just for a little bit like not nothing crazy, but it lasted for a while cause I think like I connected feet with sexuality for a while because of this one girl. I think if you start choking people like that, that could happen. If you date someone who really likes that. And this girl used to say choked me like I can't, I'm not going to choke you. And I'm like, I'm not going to do this. I can't do it. I'm not going to do it. Do it a little. She's like, took me who I'm not going to do it.

Speaker 1:          00:06:43       You know, in the wrestling match choker, like, you know, just enough. Just enough. Just a little bit. I don't need to teach you, but I'm just saying

Speaker 3:          00:06:51       some girls like it too much. But my point being is that if you got into that and then you dated a girl who is not into it at all, he started choking her. She'd be like, I can't be comfortable with you now because I'm thinking you're going to fucking choke me, Ya know? Right. That's a good point. Do you know that guy that's getting accused of beating up women? He was a host of the CBC radio show. His name is John Ghomeshi. Yes, I read about it. Yeah, he's, what's amazing is this guy was like a feminist, allegedly. You know Mr Social Justice Warrior type guy talked really calmly like this. He was one of those guys who would talk about women's issues. Let's talk about women's issues and just beat the fuck out of girls in his spare time. Like allegedly, I should say allegedly, but there's multiple counts.

Speaker 1:          00:07:38       Yeah. You don't want to believe that Jimmy Hendrix hit some girl with a telephone. Listen, we were talking about that before the show. She was telling me that Jimi Hendrix had his wife and I see, first of all, never heard, never married. And the only time Mr. Hendricks was ever in trouble, listen, God damn Canada, and I told us fucking Canadians, if you want the good music, you got to let Jimmy bring the heroin end. Can't be arrested him at the border. Yeah. I mean he's just so cool and unique. There's never been anyone else like,

Speaker 3:          00:08:02       yeah. Since then either. There's been a few guys that have kind of taken that vibe a little bit, but

Speaker 1:          00:08:07       he was the motto. Any crab that's, I'm leaving

Speaker 3:          00:08:12       Oliver while I was going to say Gary Clark Jr, is that all right? I don't know who that is. Oh, how dare you. He's amazing. He's actually really good, but he doesn't have that. He's got his own vibe, but he's just a really good guitarist and he happens to be black

Speaker 1:          00:08:23       since, you know. Wait, so what was Jimmy's shelf life like? Was he around for five years?

Speaker 3:          00:08:27       It wasn't around very long. You died at 27 he was one of those 27 guys. Yeah. You know, there's a lot, a lot of weird shit that's been going on lately where people have come out and said that he was killed. His, his girlfriend at the time, who's with him when he died, she jumped off of a building and Soho and this guy who wrote this book who like a bodyguard or worked for Jimi Hendrix manager said that Jimmy Hendrix was killed by his manager and so was the girlfriend cause she knew too much and it sounds like bullshit, but he was actually kidnapped. Jimi Hendrix was kidnapped for a couple days and his manager is the one who got him free and they said that what happened was Jimmy was thinking about leaving his manager. So his manager had Jimmy kidnapped and then made it look like he was rescuing him. Do you believe that? Yeah. I mean

Speaker 2:          00:09:16       I don't have, I do killed. Who was like such an industry making you so much money.

Speaker 3:          00:09:21       If the guy was going to leave you and you had a life insurance policy against it, have you? I mean it is possible evil. Well that's what everybody said. That shook night. Did. I mean I don't think it's beyond the realm of possibility that people who are mean evil, crazy fucks. He'll make a lot of money off artists like Jimi Hendrix manager allegedly did, would be willing to do that. I mean there's always been, there's always been like organized crime ties to music and and to artists is just so much money involved and having a guy like Hendrix with you if, if he's going to leave you, we got Phil Spector. Remember that guy who shot that fucking woman? He was always in it like he was a guy that like produce the Beatles songs and that guy was apparently always into putting guns in people's mouths. Like that was his thing. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:10:05       Feels like a power thing that maybe he was like he just got too powerful as opposed to being evil.

Speaker 3:          00:10:11       I think it's pretty evil to shoot some of the mouth. Yeah, that's true. I know, I see your point. I could see it both ways. I could see it being a bullshit story that someone wrote long after Jimi Hendrix was dead. This guy decides Cashin I'll just make some ridiculous claims and I'll make some money. It's possible. You know, there's no one knows. No one knows other than the people involved. Do you think people are evil? I think some people are evil. What do you think?

Speaker 2:          00:10:38       I Dunno. I was just thinking like, yeah, I was thinking of like Tony Soprano. He's someone who he is, you've seen depicted like he would kill someone. Right. And like, but then he liked, they justify it all cause they love their family and they pay for their family. So I'm just thinking like they must have, they must defend their lives. I wonder how evil people defend their lives.

Speaker 3:          00:10:54       I don't think they have to. I mean, what about king

Speaker 2:          00:10:56       do themselves? Yeah, I know

Speaker 3:          00:10:59       he shot someone with an antiaircraft gun. The story is that someone was, um, he was making a speech. Some guy fell asleep during a speech. So you shot him with an antiaircraft gun. Really? That was the story. I mean, obviously no one knows. But he definitely killed his uncle. He killed his uncle and his uncle's sons. So, uh, that his son's couldn't avenge his uncle because they were planning on some sort of a cool,

Speaker 2:          00:11:25       so it's like a mobster vibe. Like they're just like, I'll kill people for my betterment.

Speaker 3:          00:11:30       Hmm. Well, I mean it's a dictator vibe. It's some game of Thrones shit. I mean, that is exactly what's going on over there. Minus the dragons and the white walkers.

Speaker 2:          00:11:40       I can't watch that show. I'm sorry. I'm the only one. There should be like a group for us. What's the matter? Uh, like Howard Kramer, he calls him, make them ups and that's Kinda how I feel. Like I'm not, I can't, I can't hold my, what do you mean by make moves? And it's just like fantasy, right? It's like, it doesn't appeal to me. What do you like? I like documentaries. I like things based in reality. I like character driven dramas. And I like funny comedies. I don't like dragons and people whose mission, your hands become machine guns. I just can't get into it. It, it speaks nothing to me of my life. I can appreciate that. Okay, but you, but you question whether or not people are evil. Oh, well tell, I mean, yeah, I guess I can't, I'd like to question that and things that I can un un, you know, things that I can get with. I'm sure that game of Thrones addresses these deeper issues. If I were to be able to get past all the names and the, you know, the fantasies and the, the nonsense nonsense.

Speaker 2:          00:12:45       Winter lasts 10 years. Don't know how many years. Maybe it's because I didn't have a childhood. I can't get into fantasy childhood. I mean I was just always like the, the mom, you know what I mean? So maybe I can't like, well I was the oldest, oldest sisters, so I like took care of my brothers and my parents, you know, it was like not a fun childhood. So maybe like I don't feel like my imagination or my ability to lose myself in fantasy has been like, it's been stunted or something where your parents not paying attention or they just needed your help. I mean they were just working. And so then I was like the, the mom siblings, like five years old, five years old. So you were the one who's kind of responsible for keeping them kind of, I guess. I mean, it wasn't a terrible childhood, but just wasn't fun. I was just like looking at the clock, like let's wrap this up. Constant babysitter. Yeah. Like cooking and cleaning and like getting in trouble. Like, you know, well like not being, yeah, like being grounded. I was grounded a lot, climbing out the window, trying to get some action. And again, I'd be juicing, you know, and need to get fucked. Climb out a window.

Speaker 2:          00:14:03       Fuck some dude climbed back in. I mean, I think everyone had a bad childhood though. Pretty much anyone funny. Yeah. Like I remember listening to some Deepak Chopra thing and he was like, imagine yourself as a child by the beach with your family. And it was just like one of the, one of the good times in your life. And I was like, oh, like to some people, like their childhood was this dreamland of like where they're safe and beautiful. And everything, you know? And I find that people like that, that have these ideas of like childhood, they're the rare ones. Yeah, it's a gift. I mean, I, I'll help if I have a child, I'm sure your children have this experience. I'm sure when your children grow up, they're going to be like, remember when they took us to this amazing forest or that, you know, I'm sure you take your kids to like beautiful places, right? Where they have experiences,

Speaker 3:          00:14:56       jog, worry about that. Well, they're coming, they're coming along great so far. But I worry that that might like, they're not encountering any adversity, like really well. I mean they are, I guess socially at school there's always like, you know, Debbie's a mean bitch and she doesn't say bitch, but you know, there's, there's that kind of shit.

Speaker 2:          00:15:14       No. When we have trauma with kids, two daughters. Yeah. My friend has two daughters and one is really good at the piano and one can't play it. And she's, and I was saying how good the one was. She goes, you need to say the other one's just as good. And I was like, but she's not as, I mean I didn't say this, but it was like, wait, well one of them has talent and one of them doesn't it.

Speaker 3:          00:15:31       We tell all the kids, they all have the same amount of talent.

Speaker 2:          00:15:36       Like I specifically remember an art teacher telling me maybe art isn't my thing and it made me try harder and be more of an artist. She'd get fired. No, I know. But it helped. It helped create like drive in me.

Speaker 3:          00:15:50       Well that's done a good way to do it. Why I'm successful. I've worked with you. But it is an unusual set of circumstances. You were independent, you were already, you had a lot of responsibility. You realized you had to kind of pull yourself up by your bootstraps. So when presented with criticism like that, you kind of responded like, Oh yeah, I'll fucking show you bitch. And then you went out and got good at art. Whereas some people just would get really discouraged. Whereas someone could come along and say, you could be good at art, but this is what you're going to have to do. If you really want to be good at it. And they could recognize that and then move forward in a positive way that might work on it would work on more people, would work on more people. But see it's like the things that work on. Some people don't work on other people. I had a shitty art teacher and a, I was really good artist when I was a kid and my art teacher in high school, it's just so negative.

Speaker 3:          00:16:42       They're jealous sometimes or a lot of them are jealous of youth and also natural. Yeah. My guy was not very talented. Like he, he would draw, he would draw things like in class, you know, like we would all work on stuff and he would work on stuff. And I remember looking at him, there's this kid in my class, I always wondered what happened to him cause he was the most talented. He was more talented than me as kidney. I think his name was John Devor and I always hope that he had gone to become a famous artist, but I'd never heard of him should probably look them up. But um, it was him that I always admired and it was this kid, Kevin, who's in this class was really good too. And then I felt like it was like the third most talented, but we were all, it wasn't bad, but I was pretty good. I drew, I was like in the comic book stuff, but we were all better than the teacher

Speaker 2:          00:17:31       and I'm not bullshitting. I'm, I'm being totally honest. Public school teacher for art. I mean, that's like, it seems like that'd be a pretty, I think either of us could go get that job right now.

Speaker 3:          00:17:41       Well, I stopped when I was 15 or 16. I think it was the last, uh, like my parents were really freaked out by it too because I didn't want to take art anymore. I was like, I don't want to do it anymore. I kept drawing on my own, but I completely stopped taking art classes. Like this guy, just a fucking idiot. It just, the classes were just, it was tedious and the energy was like, he was just a really, he was probably depressed, you know? I mean he had a pot belly. I remember he had this like gut, it was a depressing gut. Like, you know, it's probably a drinking gut, you know, they like portrayed like they don't belong on the person. It says gross. Yeah. Well he just said no energy and no life. And if you had life in you, he wanted to squash it.

Speaker 3:          00:18:23       He wanted to throw a wet blankets on whatever fire you had inside of you. This is who is really weird. Like I talked to the other two guys about it. I remember specifically like this guy and the Guy John who was the most talented guy. I was like, hmm. That was his attitude is like fuck this guy. Who Cares? He just, you know, kinda like raises, eyebrows, whatever. So do you worry that your children will encounter people like that at school? Yeah, I'm sure they will. I'm sure they will. You know, and I think that there's a, I think as you're growing older you run into like a database of people, you know, you run it, you have like a whole gamut of wide spectrum and along that way you kind of get to, you learn lessons from the negative ones too. You learn like how never to talk to other people because you, you talked to someone talks to you in a way that like affects you. I can remember it like negative things that people said to me when I was a little kid that stuck with me that I remember thinking I'll never talked to a little kid like this. I'll never say that kind of shit to a little kid.

Speaker 2:          00:19:19       Yeah. And even as an adult, I remember I was, I was in college and my friend, I wanted to be an actress so bad and my friends that me down this guy and he was like, I have to talk to you. And I was like, yeah, this happened to me a couple times with men. He was like, I just don't think you're going to be as successful as you want. And I think you need to think about that. A guy sent out to the guy you were dating. He, no, just a friend and then somewhat another guy dating's a bit. So I was like, I would never tell someone that I would never sit someone down and say, I'm afraid of your dreams aren't going to happen. Can you imagine saying that to someone?

Speaker 3:          00:19:51       No, I couldn't. But I can imagine why a guy would say that to you. And the reason why probably is like you're very independent and strong. Like you're very smart. And I think that's intimidating to a lot of guys. A lot of guys need a girl that needs them. And if a guy is around a girl and the girl seems like she could be fine without you, like, you know, like there's a little too much, too much power in this one. I must, I'm a SAP it. Oh, interesting. Yeah. I think I even think of that men do that. Other men too, men do that to other men, you know? Uh, you know, in the open mic days, I remember there was a lot of that, there was a lot of guys telling other guys they weren't gonna make it or tell him. And like David Taylor, oh, he's about, he was always battle with that, but it's just an, you know, it was Dave.

Speaker 3:          00:20:40       I think he's just, you know, he's shown work through his own stuff leg. A lot of folks are, you know, it's like working through your own stuff at the expense of other people is a sport that's, I can see if I could diminish this person, but men do it a lot to women. I think some women do it to men too. You know, some women will try to convince a guy to get a regular job because, uh, it was never going to, it's never going to make, you know, look, I'm not going to make it. Well, that's, you see, you're, you're independent. You raised your sister, your brothers, you know, you, you had to do your own thing. Childhood was a drag and you're like, get me the fuck away from all these people. I got this right. That's your attitude, you know, and you're like, I'm going to be a fucking comedian.

Speaker 3:          00:21:21       And now they're like, listen, Natasha, I think you need to come to grips with reality that that might not happen. Okay. I take it, I took an acting class once and it was really gross. I had to take it because a, I got a development deal. I had this crazy development deal with Disney and they were writing a Sitcom and I had zero acting experience. I was 25. Right. So, uh, it's like all of a sudden I have this whole fucking thing handed to me. It's just completely ridiculous. And they give me this acting coach and this lady's so naked, she's so negative and she's fat and she's tired. And, and one of the things she asked is if the show goes, she, she wants me to have them pitch her as my mom.

Speaker 3:          00:22:08       She's like, if this show, if this show goes, I want you to pitch them that I could play your mom. And I remember being like, what? Like she was terrible. Like we would, we would have read and when we'd read she'd be like, so fake, you know, like when you don't like, you learn as a comic that if you're, if you're saying something that someone doesn't connect with, the shit does, it doesn't work. You know? So like when you're doing, when you're reading something like you, you've got to try to make that thing as real as this conversation is. And she was not like that. She was like, Natasha, I'm telling you right now, this is not going to work. Like, you know, it was just like so corny and clunky. And for the Disney channel it was free. He was actually for Fox. It was for Fox, but it was, Disney had the development deal.

Speaker 3:          00:22:56       So, um, she one day she said to me, she like during the, uh, she goes, I'm worried that you're going to go out there and you're going to fail. That's what she said to me. And I go, why are you worried about that? Cause I'm not worried about that. I go, I'm not worried about that at all. Let's just do this. And like, I like turned around the class, you know, I go, look, I'm not worried about this at all, that much strength at 25 to say that I would've started balling. I came from a different world. I came from the world of fighting, you know, so I had been competing in martial arts tournaments my whole life. So like this lady telling me that I'm gonna fail at what? Acting what? I'm going to freak out when they say action, the fuck Outta here, bitch.

Speaker 3:          00:23:36       The whole thing was so ridiculous to me, but it was so obvious to me that she was trying to intimidate me and it was that she didn't like that it was too confident. She didn't like that I was cocky. It was bothering her. It's like, I'm worried you're going to go out there and you're gonna fail. I'm like, acting this shit that I'm already better at you. Better at than you. It's ridiculous and I'm not even good at it and you're fucking teaching it. I'm terrible at it and I'm better than you and you teach it so fuck off. But it was, it was a clear feeling that she was trying to diminish me. And I remember thinking, Oh this is scary. I was scared if I had kids that that was going to happen. The champ, what you, it's like you would maybe be scared because you didn't have a lot of time with your parents. We, they were encouraging you and helping you. I'm around my kids all the time. You are. Yeah. I spend like I spend full days, like every Tuesdays, daddy daughter day we do. Yeah. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:24:30       yeah. Dunkin said ones and I thought this was so smart. He said the best Karma you can have as being born into a good family. Yeah. And I thought that was like really interesting cause it's like that is just a lucky, lucky person because you're going to get all of the, you know, your kids are like my friend Ricky and I figured this out. It's like your kids are like a second generation success. Like you did it yourself and now your kids are benefiting. You know, they're at the level that like Lena Dunham's going to, you know, like her parents were successful and got themselves out of it. And you know, like you see these people who like you're the first generation of someone who, who climbed out of the mud or you're like the fourth generation, like your grandma was working for civil rights and then your parents were successful artists and then now you're an artist. It's like it does a generation thing where I think you'd benefit and you can get success earlier.

Speaker 3:          00:25:19       Yeah, maybe. But I think it's also difficult because they didn't earn it themselves. Like I have a friend and his parents were very successful and he worked for his family business for awhile, but he, it always bothered him even though he was doing well. He's like, I didn't earn any of this. Like this is kind of freaks me out. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:25:36       But look it, I mean, there's so many famous people who have kids who are losers and it does take something, I mean,

Speaker 3:          00:25:42       well I think with them it's neglect, but they just might not have the drive or the ambition or a little bit of that. But it's a lot of like, if it's, a lot of it happens with actors. Yeah. Because they're working and they go away from more to the, yes, yes, yes. I think, I think there's a lot of actors that are like really fucking self obsessed and n singers and it's celebrities where they're just, you know, if you're going to be fucking share or something like that, like, yeah, good luck taking vacations. Good luck having fun with your kids. Like you're, you're, you're the CEO of an empire that is, you know, whoever the fuck you are, you know, fill in the blank with whatever superstar. That dive requires everything you have.

Speaker 2:          00:26:25       No, I knew someone who knew like Barbara Streisand son and he wouldn't, you know, he had, he had hit, he'd have a play and she would wouldn't show up. And you know, it's like how, but I'm sure you can make it happen somehow. All

Speaker 3:          00:26:37       right. Yeah. I mean it's requires a lot of communication. You know, I have a stepdaughter, the 18. Really? Yeah. I've been with her for since she was little.

Speaker 2:          00:26:47       That's so funny. You have all daughters. It is funny because you're so like masculine, you know,

Speaker 3:          00:26:54       that happens a lot. A lot of fighters have um, uh, daughters. It's like really, really common. I liked that you consider yourself a fighter. My dog.

Speaker 2:          00:27:04       Do you feel like you're a comedian more than a fighter?

Speaker 3:          00:27:06       No. I'm a human being I think, but I do a lot of different stuff, but I'm just saying a lot of UFC fighters, a lot of them have daughters. Like it's like, like they joke around about it, let it, it's like a fighter's curse that a lot of them have daughters for some reason. Your blessing, they don't go into that bloody fields. Wretched. I think it's a balance thing. I think the universe gives you like this gift of, of a different type of human being neurons and also the different perspective. Raising daughters to me has been very, very educational because a, raising them and being around them all the time, you kind of, you understand first of all that you're dealing with a completely different kind of human being. Whereas, yeah, we were so when I was a kid, daughters or girls rather, we're always like, it was us and them.

Speaker 3:          00:27:55       It was like boys. And then there was girls and now I don't know what the fuck, what are they wearing? Makeup and shoes and weird shit. I fucking gets it. You know, you didn't get it. I mean, I had a sister but I didn't, I didn't understand them the way I understand them. Like having a wife and having daughters, like I kind of, I'm way a way more tuned in to that style of human being than I was when I was a young man. That style of humor. Well that's what it is. It's a different kind of human being. You know, you're a different kind of human being than me.

Speaker 2:          00:28:29       You know, I don't like make 'em ups. I don't like blood might come up unique

Speaker 3:          00:28:35       in your own feminine and an eight, but a woman is a different kind of human. It takes a long time to sort of figure out the ins and the outs of that. I think it's probably really difficult for you to understand what goes on in a man's mind. Just like it's really difficult for a man to understand what goes on in a woman's mind. And when you see it from the time they're infants, when the time when they were little babies, it gives you more insight than growing up with your sister. You know, growing up with my sister, I of I love my sister, she's awesome and I love her to death, but she's my sister, you know, she's not like a baby that I saw grow. And so like raising daughters has been insanely educational for me. You know, and you care about them so much.

Speaker 3:          00:29:18       It's a weird thing. You care about them that you don't care about them. Like you love them, you care about them like you love them more than you love your own life. It's real weird. Love your two hours, but if I did, yes. Yeah. My, my friend Eddie, he had rabbits and I'm different than it to Allah. Well, yes, I guess, but he had cats and he loves these animals. He loves the shit out of him. And his wife was pregnant and I said, listen dude, once your baby's born, you're going to want to kill those fucking cats transfer. We just shoot. He's like, no way, man. No Way. I'm telling you, I'm telling you, you're not going to give a fuck about those animals anymore. You're going to love your kid so much. You're going to laugh at the idea of how much you love these animals. I mean, you're not really gonna kill the animals, but is that true? Yes. Yeah. You're the, the dose shift is substantial. The level of love. Like you could leave your kid in the Kennel for a weekend, right? Yeah. I mean, your dog, you could leave your dog in a Kennel for a weekend, go somewhere. You can't leave. Your kid cannot. You can't leave your kid for an hour. You freak out. It's weird. It's a weird feeling,

Speaker 2:          00:30:24       consistent thing. They give back, you know, like they're cute, they lay with you, but they don't really talk. They don't grow. It's just kind of like they just do their thing for 12 years and then they die.

Speaker 3:          00:30:34       They don't have questions like, uh, my three year old, well she's a, she's five now, but when she turned three, she started crying and I go, what's manner? She goes, I'm still litter. And I go, did you think that when you turn three that you would be bigger? She goes, yeah, I go, no, it's a gradual cause she's the youngest is going to get tall talk. Like all of a sudden she'd be bigger. Oh, I mean it's like that kind of thinking like mind expanding too. Yeah. It's fascinating. It's unbelievably fascinating. It's, it's like, you know, I really like, it's not a chore. Like if I had a babysit someone's kid, it would be kind of a chore. But hanging out with my kids is not a chore at all. It's like I love it. It's really fun. Like it doesn't seem like something like a man would love to do is hang out with little girls.

Speaker 3:          00:31:22       But I love how, you know, we play all kinds of silly games and we played kitchen, they have like little fake kitchen shit and they make me fake food and pretend to eat it. And we joke around about stuff. It's very a very different way of living life. You discipline them. I don't discipline the like I don't beat them. Is that what you're asking me, Bill? I'm just wondering like how, yeah, like how do they get dive and when you have to explain to them when they're doing the wrong. Yeah. Well that's, I mean that's sort of educational. I mean, when they do something wrong, you have to explain that they can't do that. But you have to do it in one of the things that I always do is I always let them know that any, any fuck up that they've had, any mistake they make, I've already done it.

Speaker 3:          00:32:01       I've already fucked up. I fucked up way more than you. Like if there's a fuck no, I try not to. I swear every now and then, but most of the time now. One time, one time when my, uh, my daughter was three, two, I've been taking them skins. It's a really little, when she was three we were at the ski place and she forgot to pack her helmet and her suitcase and a, you know, we're, we're getting ready to leave. And uh, I go, oh, we didn't pack her helmet and she looks at her luggage. She goes, shit, everyone laughs. No, my wife turned and looked at me like, oh no, like don't say anything. Cause if you laughed and they think it's

Speaker 2:          00:32:39       right and then we'll keep doing it. That's it. Sarah Silverman said in her book that she, she would get so much positive energy when she would swear that does created a comedian. But see that created a comedian in a lot of ways. Yeah. I mean, so it's interesting what's going to happen. I mean I'm, I'm sure you're doing an amazing job with your kids, but from what I've seen with my friends, there's so much positive encouragement happening in this generation where it's like I was talking to my friends kids and I was talking about New York. She goes, can you not, can you not say anything negative about New York? I really want them to think of it as a vibrant city and like every bar, every single thing and like I was like swimming with her and she's like make sure she does the breast stroke the right way. I don't want her learning the wrong way and it's just, I mean this might be an extreme example, but at the same time I think like wow, like this is just, and then those kids are going to give birth to Cyborg or those people. What is your kit? What is your three year old or five year olds child going to be like, yeah, they're going to have implants in their brains.

Speaker 3:          00:33:35       Well I think that's going to happen already. Have you seen that implant that they came out with? They won't even know life though. Like how we know that they won't, I mean even kids that are teenagers today don't know life the way we know live because we grew up without the internet.

Speaker 2:          00:33:47       I mean I used to check my internet at the video store, my email at the video store when I moved to La. I like didn't want to get a cell phone. I'd go to the video store. How come you didn't want to, well it was like 12 years ago. Cause I've always been kind of anti technology. I've never wanted TVs around me. Oops. I'll make them up. I like, I mean I'm, you know, I, I like, uh, I like re I used to like reading more and

Speaker 3:          00:34:08       they have this new lens that they're going to insert into people's eyes. It'll give you three times the vision of 2020. It's insane. What does that seem at gym? You can't see far away. You're going to be able to see in like way clear, way further, way more detail than any human being can, right? Way. But what does that

Speaker 2:          00:34:24       do by the way? Cause everyone's like HD. It's so great. And it makes women look like shit or men. But like, what's it gonna do for our skin? Is that going to make us look less attractive?

Speaker 3:          00:34:34       That's what I wonder. Yes. We'll, we'll, we'll just tell him that. We'll, we'll only meet and then I'll look at my husband's pores. Are you scared of pores?

Speaker 2:          00:34:44       No, but I just mean like, you know what, they're, you know what there's going to be, I bet like little cartoon mascot or something that we could put on our faces so that you can't even age.

Speaker 3:          00:34:52       Right? Like instead of, uh, instead of like makeup, you'll just wear a mask. Maybe while there was another study recently that they've found a way to like reverse aging in certain cells. This is the, uh, optometrist claims to invent Lens three times better than 20, 20 vision. I wonder what it looks like in that though. Yeah. Who the fuck knows devices called a [inaudible] met ticks argument ex bionic Lens. He claimed it allows you to see three times better than 20, 20 vision without wearing contacts or glasses at all. So they think that like macular degeneration is a thing of the past. In about 10 seconds, a lens unravels over your eye and your site is immediately corrected. Well, I understand that if you've got bad eyesight, just putting that

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       in to like try to be a super, super hero.

Speaker 3:          00:35:42       This is what it's going to be implanted in your honor during an eight minute painless procedure similar to Cadillac cataract surgery. It's folded like a Taco and placed in the eye using a syringe filled with céline solution.

Speaker 2:          00:35:55       Wow. But here's the thing that's going to happen. There's going to be an anti technology movement and then there's going to be the people who want to do this and then was going to be the people who are like, like, already, I see it in New York. They're like advertising at these like cool hipster bars. Like no TV in here. You know, like it's like people want to go to these havens of like just socializing with people and, and, and eating farm to table and, and you know, like there's all these like farm movements and I think there's going to be this kind of, uh, hopefully like a new sixties that's like another hippie movement against all of this technology or a lot of that, I'm going to start it,

Speaker 3:          00:36:33       you'll be a part of it, but there's a lot of bars and restaurants are into like metal and wood and it makes it look like real rustic click all the like, like the tables like this table, you know, like brick walls, like people into like real things as opposed to like plastics and you know, and, and shiny like, like different colored lights like the inside of a virgin mobile plain, you know? Yeah. You know what I mean? It's like that,

Speaker 2:          00:36:59       but some people are super into that way. Like people just want it like they want, they cannot wait like someone like red band or like someone, you know, it's like he probably like, I feel like every technology he's like absorbing and trying and I mean there's like that extreme kind of person, but looking at him it's a mess. That's why I picked him. No, I'm just kidding. But he's funny and silly. Yeah, no, he's great. He's at the cutting edge of technology and there's a lot of people like that. They get inspired by it, whereas like, well I'm on like that and a lot of ways I love technology. Yeah. Most people around me are like that.

Speaker 3:          00:37:33       I just find human innovation fascinating. I think the idea of human innovation, I just think it's a, it's a, an unstoppable process I think. I think unless we get wiped out, unless something horrible happens to the human race, it's inevitable. We're just going to continue to innovate. And I, you know, I extrapolated, I take it like really far. I think about it all the time. Like what exactly is happening? I think we are giving birth to a new type of life.

Speaker 2:          00:37:58       We are. But here's the thing, I was just reading this really interesting article in the week and they were saying innovation has stopped in the sense of like they used to be like more money put towards cancer research and going to space and now everyone, the only innovations that are happening are with the phone. It's all about the phone. It's, but it, it is in a way like all we care about is our phones and, and how fast they're moving and what they can get us in the gps and what they're going to project into our brains and into our lives. And I feel like

Speaker 3:          00:38:25       it's an intimate attachment for sure. But it's absolutely not true that that's the only innovation. Have you seen oculus rift?

Speaker 2:          00:38:32       It still has to do. Yes, I've had, I've tried it. It's amazing. But it still has to do with like, it's like a video game basically. Right. But that has nothing to do with your phone. Well, it's, it's a part, it's, it's part of that realm.

Speaker 3:          00:38:45       Well that's the realm of artificial reality. Simulated reality is the future. But what about curing cancer? And there's lots of work being done on that. A lot of innovation being done on curing cancer, a lot of innovation on all sorts of diseases. I mean medical innovation has probably never been higher. I think throughout the, the, the, the full range of things that people are interested in, innovation is accelerating. I just don't agree with that at all. And people are always looking to get negative and poo poo and try to define where things are growing and not growing because it makes them look like they're smart for pointing it out. But I don't buy it. I think it's a human characteristic of a human trait that's inherent to the monkey mind that they want to figure things out and they build on all the things that have been figured out before them.

Speaker 3:          00:39:33       And it's inevitable. It just continues and goes and moves forward. I mean, um, I have this guy in Aubrey de Grey recently who uh, is, um, is life extension, um, guy from, he was originally and where was he? It's Columbia and now he's a, now he runs this separate or Oxford when one of his major university. But now he runs this, um, this organization that is dedicated to finding the best and brightest minds that are involved in life extension technologies and the way genes expressed themselves. I mean there's loser, all sorts of crazy work that's being done right now. And artificial intelligence is funding that different people. I mean they're, they're, they're actively trying to recruit people, um, to, to donate money. I mean, that's one of the reasons why I came on this podcast to promote his, uh, his cause and try to get people to donate money to this

Speaker 2:          00:40:27       warrant. These things. I and I, you might know more about this than I do warrant these, didn't these things used to be funded by institutions? Like wasn't apple funded by some college like college?

Speaker 3:          00:40:38       No, apple was a private institution. I mean, I'm sure they've probably gotten some money, probably gotten some money from some people, but no, it's a privately funded institution. But you know what, there's, there's a lot of money in the private sector. Like that's one of the criticisms about like the space program, like space program has kind of fallen off because the government doesn't want to fund it. So then Elon Musk comes wrong and this space x thing and there's all sorts of, there was something that just came out today about a Elon Musk and space x space x is, I don't know. Well they're trying to develop a privately funded space exploration. Whoa. Yeah. And the idea being is that you look at all the innovation that's gone in this country, whether it's the invention of airplanes, you know the,

Speaker 2:          00:41:23       that was another thing they mentioned. They said airplanes. He used to be able to go in three hours and then what happened to that? That was 25 years ago. Why haven't we, why haven't we built on that technology? What do you mean like supersonic, the Concorde did

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       not go to like in three hours you could be in New York or rich people died. People were dying from that. Oh yeah. That's one of the reasons it shutdown and really rich people fucking gut got toasted on the runway,

Speaker 2:          00:41:46       but they didn't continue. The innovation. I would love to get somewhere in two hours and not have to have it take to get to Rome. It's like 18 hours.

Speaker 3:          00:41:54       It's fucking dangerous. Really. You're going fast as shit and you're dealing with the same kind of metals. I mean, unless they innovate and come up with different metals and make things much more difficult. Elon Musk, space x is about to tap ship. Huge march a new spaceship. Does that go? That guy is such a fucking freak. Imagine being around him. Who is he? I don't even understand. He's like some alien him. So his is he, does he come from some Mars? Mostly Mars. Like someone like that. They must come from family money. Why do you say that? No, because he was broke just a few years back. Yeah, they were, I mean, he was trying to get funding for space x at the same time he was working on Tesla and he was trying to figure out whether or not he should abandoned one of the projects. How, but so he just did investments. I don't know. I don't know. I'd be talking out my ass, but uh, he, I don't, I don't believe he came from money. Did he come from how? He's not that old. I think he's like 40 or something.

Speaker 2:          00:42:51       And so he is so it didn't, isn't Richard Branson trying to do that?

Speaker 3:          00:42:56       Yeah. Virgin. Yeah. Yeah. I mean he's funding a lot of different things, but they're, one of their jets just blew up. They had one that they were a, this like prototype that they were using and a, it just crashed and people died. AndW would you go in one of those? I'm not going to be an early adopter. That's for fucking sure. No, I mean, I read and getting to a, you don't know who wouldn't? He'll be for the first to try on the virtual space helmet, know he'll, he'll be the first to get one of the implants, but I don't, I don't have any desire to leave this planet. I just think that's foolhardy. He made his money with paypal, paypal. Oh, that's right. Yeah. He created paypal part of that. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. So he's just an innovator. How old is he? 43. Yeah. Oh, oh 71 71. There you go. He's is just a fucking genius. He's iron man. He's basically Tony Stark but not quite as content. Yeah, I mean that's funny. That desire to go to Mars, they could socket. Those people are ready. That's going to happen up there would be terrible. I have a whole bit about it in my act. I don't want to start spewing out my jokes.

Speaker 2:          00:44:03       I do like your stuff about aliens and uh, you know, life on other planets. I feel like you always kind of can connect on these larger topics in a way that I don't think I've ever seen anyone do really. I mean, have you ever seen people captivate an audience talking like we're, you'll have silence for, uh, you know, while you're explaining and everyone's listening and then it'll end in laughs. Yeah, it's really cool. Well, thanks. I mean, I've never seen anyone do that. Well, it's just

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       things that I'm interested in. If you're, if, if, if it's not something, I think, especially with standup, you have to really care about what you're talking about. It's the number one thing. And when you start going through the motions, like what is sadder, if anything than an old comic that's been doing the same material for 15 years. You know those guys that you'll occasionally see at the store, you know they get that 1215 spot and you'll watch that same act that you've seen. Like maybe you saw on MTV half hour comedy hour 20 years ago or something. I mean I'm not joking. There's a lot of those guys, they just, and they don't care about the material anymore. There's no attachment to it anymore. This is like

Speaker 2:          00:45:09       the state does care about that $16 they're making it. The companies too

Speaker 3:          00:45:14       keep doing it because they don't want to admit they don't do it anymore. But that happens to a lot of guys. They just stop. They just stop being relevant. They stopped caring and that's the worst aspect. But the best aspect of comedy is when someone is talking about some shit that they really think about that really means something to them. And that's, that's when the audience connects with it. Cause I think stand up in some weird form in some weird way. It's kind of like a form of mass hypnosis I think in the operates on the v very similar level because you know this like I've seen you on stage when you're killing, right? And when you're killing, right? When you're locked in and everyone's laughing and you're hitting every pause, right, and you have air in your, you're locked in, everyone's respond. Those people are thinking the way you're thinking, like you're guiding them. Like, I've watched you on stage specifically do this. Like where are you when you're complimented. No, I'm telling you, I saw you the other night. You were at the store you were killing, but, but you know what I'm saying? Like

Speaker 2:          00:46:16       when you're in that moment, just thing idea that they're in now with you. Yeah. They agree with you. Are there in your mind,

Speaker 3:          00:46:22       well w okay. The other night when you were at the store and you were talking about the Armenian genocide and that fucking guy in the audience.

Speaker 2:          00:46:31       Oh right. Yeah. He was like, you'll racist. It was just an Uber joke.

Speaker 3:          00:46:35       Yeah. It was a joke about learning about the Armenian genocide because she got in an Uber driver within Armenia and he was fucking lecturing you. Exactly. Yes. It was funny, but it was the way he handled it, the way eat like you led the whole audience along, like everybody was with you. The reason why everybody's with you is because you were locked in to this subject who were locked into this idea.

Speaker 2:          00:46:57       And I knew it was true. Yeah. Yeah. But so yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:47:01       but you know what I'm saying, like this isn't, this isn't anything casual. This wasn't anything that you really didn't give a fuck about. Like in that moment I was with you who the whole audience was with you or like locked into your mind. Like I think that's what, when someone's killing on stage, they might, you might as well be getting them to quit smoking. You might as well be getting that audience to lose weight or just stop beating their dog or whatever the fuck you're trying to get hypnotized.

Speaker 2:          00:47:24       Well, how do you get into that? Hit hypnos like how do you, yeah, how do you, how do you, cause I didn't Chris rock say you have to be like part preacher

Speaker 3:          00:47:33       [inaudible] a little bit. Well his style is very much preacher. You know, Sam Kennison obviously was a preacher he wasn't running with, oh, you didn't know no license plate on his HBO special said x Rev on his corvette. That's, yeah. And that was his, you know, that was his thing. I wonder if there's tricks for sure.

Speaker 2:          00:47:55       Ooh, to lock in to get into that much. Well, one thing I think you can do is really try to feel it. Like I've, I've definitely felt how I can turn around a set where I'm like, this is going through the motions. They're not connecting and it's a long set on the road. So I'm like, I have 40 more minutes left. Ooh. You know, so then it's like, oh well maybe I can in the middle of this, try to start feeling what I'm saying for the first time. I think that can maybe help a little bit to really like almost like an acting exercise. Like, because sometimes you'll say the words and you're not even thinking about what they mean. You can't do that. It happened. I mean two shows on a Saturday, two shows on a Friday. It's like I don't even know what's coming out of my mouth half the time and I can't tell you how many times on my second show I'm like, I'm talking and while I'm talking I'm looking at people. I'm looking at people's faces to see if I've done this joke already in this set because I, I'm all over the place and I don't have an order sometimes. Right. So then how can you, I just can't, I can't keep track of it.

Speaker 3:          00:48:50       I always write set lists. I need to start doing that. Even if I don't use a set list, at least I write it out so that, you know, if you've like in the board or like this doesn't go up top, what I'll fuck around sometimes and I'll just decided to do my closing bit first. But then how do you know the club yet? So you gotta be careful. But I just, I think that at least my style of comedy is I like to just go with wherever my brain wants to go. And if my brain, like if I'll start talking about something and something comes up and then my closing bit is appropriate at that moment. Yeah. I just go with it. And then, well how are you going to close the show? I don't, I close on another bit. You know the idea is to get a bit that's so get any bit that's so strong you can close with it. And if not all your bits should be like that. Yeah. All your bits should be like to a point where they aren't always like you got to build them. Like there's a lot of like I abandoned my act in [inaudible] in November because that's when my new comedy central special came out. So I passed November. Yes. So all this stuff from November to now is all completely new. So pick one of those things to close on a, at a club, they're dead. They're dead to me. Oh man was pressure.

Speaker 2:          00:50:03       So one, one comedy special. Your crystal. He is on a second comedy special this year. It's too much. It's too much for me to like keep up with,

Speaker 3:          00:50:10       well he's the, he did his last one over a year ago

Speaker 2:          00:50:13       saying it's Ah, I'm, I'm filming mine in three weeks and some of the jokes are like, you know, two years old, but I'm like so sick of them now. I'm like, how am I going to avoid, I know. I'm like, how am I going to find in one week, nine days? How am I going to find this energy to make it feel fresh for my taping? It's so hard. No, I'm not going to smoke pot then. I'm definitely not going to know if I've done it before. That helps you. Is that, what are the tricks to get into that hypnosis?

Speaker 3:          00:50:43       Yeah. Yeah. It gets you in the groove. It makes me very sensitive, like almost paranoid.

Speaker 2:          00:50:49       So you're, you're of the mind of doing it before you go, you go to [inaudible]? Not after both. I like both. I like pot. I did too. It works great for my personality. Yeah. That's what my therapist said, cause I was like, I think I might smoke. You know, maybe I shouldn't smoke pot. And he was like, no, you're chill. It makes you more chill. It's totally fine. Like you have the right vibe for it.

Speaker 3:          00:51:11       Um, if you enjoy it though, I just think it's, it can be tricky. You can definitely fuck with you. And if you're one of those people that's like really impulsive or a really, uh, you have addictive tendencies and you like to do things a little bit too much. Yeah, it can be a, it can be a problem. Like I know people that do smoke pot all day every day, which I don't recommend. I take big long breaks, you know.

Speaker 2:          00:51:33       Can you say breaks? You mean breaks in the day?

Speaker 3:          00:51:35       No, I mean look, weeks I like to take like a week off, two weeks off, and then when I go back to it, I appreciate it more. I don't like doing anything all the time. Like I take, I'll take breaks off working out, I'll take breaks off of everything. I think it's important to take. I'll take bricks off, stand up. Like sometimes I'm like, I need a fucking week off. I'm just taking a week off. I'm not doing shit this week. I'm not calling in for spots, I'm not doing shit.

Speaker 2:          00:51:58       I like to learn about your phone that has the constant information coming through. We need you in this, that respond emails. It's just getting like more and more,

Speaker 3:          00:52:08       more. I'm notoriously difficult to get ahold of. Like my manager, they're always laughing about I'm the one client that will just, I'll abandon my phone. I like think like most people are constantly calling constantly like, what's going on with this? What's going on with that? I'm the total opposite. Like they can't even find me. Like I vanish. I shut my phone off and I just don't, I don't respond because I feel like if you have fuck you money and you don't say fuck you, you don't deserve fuck you money. What are you doing with that money? Freaking out all the time. Why don't you just say fuck you just chill. Just chill. Got to get that money. Yeah. You got to enjoy the whole process and part of enjoying the whole process is and enjoying the whole, the moment, like all the moments like I like doing like a, we were talking about yoga.

Speaker 3:          00:52:55       I'm like doing yoga. I like, I like to an archery. I like going and shooting arrows at targets. It's, it's exciting. It's fun. I like doing different shit. That's why I like doing Jujitsu. That's why I like doing, I like doing Moitai. I like doing weird shit. I like doing things and I think that you get locked into one thing for too long. I think it limits you in what limits your, your point of references limits your mind. Like there's certain people that like all they give a fuck about it. It's like say golf. That's all they care about. They're like, you'll see them like fake golf, swimming, swinging during the day. I don't think as an artist

Speaker 2:          00:53:30       especially, I hate golf. I think it's like a problem. I think it's the worst aesthetic. I think it ruins hotels. I think it's ruins hotels. It's just like whenever I go to a hotel that is like golf scent, like centered around golf, I don't want to be there. It's like old white Republicans walking around. They all at crusty and they're pastels and they just seem like they drank too much in a bad sense of humor. I just think it's an ugly aesthetic and it's terrible for the environment to keep those golf courses green.

Speaker 3:          00:53:57       It is in California, in Seattle. It's really not that big a deal. Right. In California. Yeah. It's, it's not cool. There's still conservative. I just hate it. There's a lot of conservative people that play golf. It's, it's a business thing. A lot of guys who uh, play golf, they do a lot of business meetings on the golf course. I think it gets them away from women because they get out there by themselves. All a bunch of guys, they drink beer and they talk shit and they walk balls around. Cause I think a lot of people are like massively suppressed by office environments and they just seek out any possible way that they can be themselves. Yeah. It's just, it's a valve. You know, for a lot of men?

Speaker 2:          00:54:35       No, I, I was thinking about like, because I'm so stressed out about my special, which I'm taping in a week and I'm like, all I care about is it being over. I just want it to be over. I just want to get over it. And then I'm like, as soon as the special is done, I'm gonna have something else I have to focus on. So if my whole life is like, God, I hope this is over soon. It's like that's no way to live.

Speaker 3:          00:54:52       Yeah. But the pressure is, is overwhelming. Like as a comic, especially because you're the writer, the producer, the creator and the performer. There's a lot of shit going on when you get on that stage nine days from now and do it, just the weight of your world is completely on your shoulders. It's very different than any other style of performing. It's different than music because you have a backup band. It's different than a sitcom because there's writers and directors, there's a lot of shit going on. You're, you're responsible for it. Totally. And that wears on people. And a lot of times, well it wears on people is the way you look at it and the way you approach it. And I've been on both sides. I've been where I felt great and I felt like really loose and comfortable and not worried about it at all. And then I've also been in a place where I was like really fucking stressed out about it. You know I've been, I've been in both places and I think a lot of it is my appreciation for the process. I think when I appreciate the process am I look at it the right way, which have kind of like cultivated over the last decade or so of my life that when I really, really appreciate it then it's all fun. And even though there's like pressure and stress, it's fun and I enjoy it. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:56:03       When you say process, what do you mean exactly? Like just the fact that you've been able to like think of these jokes and write them and perform them and people love them.

Speaker 3:          00:56:12       Well, the whole process of creating set, I mean creating a bit, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:56:16       it is cool how it works cause it's like you'll see this bit and it's like, wait, did this really happen to me? You're like, wait, this did happen. Like this, this girl is a bitch. And then I thought of this idea and then it turned into this and then I added this to it and then made it connect with this bit. It's like, yeah. So it is, it is collaborative and you know, you're collaborating with your life to like make these things.

Speaker 3:          00:56:37       I had a freaky fucking nightmare last night that I'm just now remembering. Uh, and in the nightmare I woke up in the morning, take a leak and as I woke up I woke up like with it, like I woke up at like five 30. And what does nightmare in my head, it was like, Oh, weird nightmare where I could not remember whether or not I had committed a crime and I was trying to remember whether or not it was a dream or it was an actual crime that I had committed and that was the nightmare. The nightmare was that I had like I had, I was really confused. Like, did I do something fucked up or is this bullshit or is this a dream? And then I woke up and I was like, wait a minute, this is a dream that I dreamed that I did. Something fucked up or I was confused.

Speaker 3:          00:57:18       It was really weird. So scary. Yeah, it was really weird. But I dunno how it relates, but the idea, I think one of the ways it relates is like when you're putting together a bit, it's almost like it's not even you doing it. It's almost like when I'm on stage and um, and I'm really in the groove and the these long, sometimes I'll line like a tag will come on up fucking nowhere and it's the perfect tag and then you go, did I just write that? Is that mine? Yeah. Yeah. Out of nowhere. And the only way that works is if you allow yourself to go into these fucking weird places while you're on stage. And he'd go down dark alleys and sometimes there's no fucking way out and it doesn't work. And you've got to, you got to talk your way out of that alley.

Speaker 3:          00:58:05       I'm gonna figure out how to put it back together again. That's what I'm talking like that's the process. The process is uncertainty. It's confusion, it's like, and then finally a finished thing and you can only hold on to that finish thing for, it's like a sand castle. Like you build it, it's beautiful. But the fucking waters common bitch, the harvest Carmen. And you've got to accept that. And people are like, I want to turn it into summit and keep it forever and I want to live in it. You can't live in it, you can't live in it,

Speaker 2:          00:58:32       but you shouldn't be afraid of like, what if I bring a whole bunch of people to see you and I loved one of your alien bits. And I'm like, yeah, wait, he does this part and then you're doing all new stuff. It's like, why can't you bring a few people? Like that idea that like nobody wants anything that has already been released or recorded. Everything must be new all the time. Well,

Speaker 3:          00:58:52       I don't think everything needs to be new all the time, but my stuff has a cycle, at least from me though. I do my best work when it has a cycle because I feel like if I'm working on a, if I'm doing a an old bit that's already done. Um, nothing wrong with that. There's nothing wrong with it. But I feel like at a certain point in time that's taking away from creating a new bid, it's taking away from making a new bit as good as those old bits and that energy that I'll put into that old bit. It's, you know, especially if I'm doing it all the time or even adding new tags to it. Like I could be adding new stuff to a new bid. I could make be making a new bit as good as one of my old bits. So that's just the only way. The way it's good for me is if I'm constantly updating. I give myself like a year and a half and then I'm done. I'm moving on like a year and a half and then I have to film it. How many specials have you done? Let me see. Um, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

Speaker 2:          01:00:01       You're prolific energy. Eight, seven or eight. I'm trying to figure out, I was watching this documentary on like folk music and it was, but someone was saying, don't laugh. Fuck. She's hilarious. I mean hundreds isn't that far from folk? Um, yes he is. I mean he's rock and roll, but like he came from that era of like hippies anyway. Hmm. Yeah, he definitely came from the hippie. Some like,

Speaker 3:          01:00:27       you know why? Cause he likes white buzzy. That's what was up with that. There's only one way. You got to find the hippies.

Speaker 2:          01:00:34       I mean, he has like, he has a whole album of like low key. No, he definitely will catch on the sand. It's not all like electronic or electric insanity. No, you're definitely right. But anyway, so I'm watching this documentary and it was some folk artists was saying like, your first albums, you know, easy, but your second album, that's how they can tell you're made up because your first album is like 10 years of struggle. This is what I've had to save for the last decade and now it's finally coming out. Whereas like, it's a hit your second album, here's a year, here's what I can come up with. You know, it's, it's not as, it's, it's like it's, it's just harder.

Speaker 3:          01:01:11       Yeah. My first CD I did was in 1999 and I started comedy and 88.

Speaker 2:          01:01:17       Right. So that's like a mall. Yeah. So much of you that you've been, you know,

Speaker 3:          01:01:23       my next one a year later. And that was kind of weird.

Speaker 2:          01:01:26       And it's also hard to stay funny a year later. Did, was it just as good? Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:01:30       Um, I don't know. I'm not sure. I think they all suck now, you know, and I go back and listen to my old stuff like eight. It really? Yeah. I can't listen to my old stuff until about 2006 like shiny, happy Jihad. That was my 2006 comedy central special or comedy central. A CD. I still like that.

Speaker 2:          01:01:48       Is that around the Rem Shiny Happy People time? Um,

Speaker 3:          01:01:52       no. Our, that was earlier than that shiny happy Jihad was right around. It was after September 11th. There was a couple of years later there's the suicide bomber talk and I had all this Islamic radical material about them blowing themselves up per pussy and another dimension. It was a political comedian. Not really, no, not really political at all, but I think it's a, it's a bad hustle like to to, to like, like I have friends that are Democrats. They'll talk about like, we, they'll say like, you know, we got to win this election because we w w what? What is this? What the fuck are you talking about? What does this we shit white man, you know, it doesn't make any sense to me. Like, I think the p the politics in this country are so corrupt. It's so stupid. It's so unfixable.

Speaker 2:          01:02:35       Oh, what about the uh, oh, you're going to claim you have to play that. We'll wait. We'll do it right now. I don't believe in pilot. I mean I don't believe in Republican Democrat. I made it seem silly. I would say that I, I would rather vote for a female criminal than a male criminal. So I would probably vote for Hillary. Really? Was that it? Just because I think that women, uh, I would like women have power. Why is that? Why? Because I'm a woman and I feel like, you know, we still can't get abortions. Like all these new abortion restrictions have just been introduced, are brand new that are in effect in November. And I just feel like this has already been taken care of and the men are bringing it back up and it's, it's just a way to bringing that back up to unfortunately really just thing.

Speaker 2:          01:03:17       Yeah, there's a lot of, I mean, you go to this pro choice child, I mean, I just don't even understand. Well now Spartan Munich. Okay, well, whatever, like the embryo is the second the sperm hits me, it's like I just don't understand how that is a life that we need to worry about. Well, no, I may mean I completely agree with you. It does not make any sense. And it's in my body. Yeah. So it's like if it was in a man's body it would be totally different. I think. Yeah. I have a joke about that. You, me,

Speaker 3:          01:03:46       uh, if babies came out of dude's Dicks, there'd be four people on the planet and abortion would be an APP on your phone.

Speaker 2:          01:03:52       Right, right. Probably would be right. I think that's political without being like, we don't really,

Speaker 3:          01:03:57       we republicans, you know, well, it's just the nature of what it is is people worried about babies. Right. And then like worried about life and worried about like the religious idea of procreating and

Speaker 2:          01:04:11       yeah. But as soon as it comes out of our bodies, they can like pay at minimum wage or take away it's health insurance or send it off to war. It's like they just care about it as an embryo. It's, it makes no sense. And the fact that that women have to wait 72 hours to have an abortion in Oklahoma now and zero hours to buy a gun. And the fact that like women have to go to a across the state lines,

Speaker 3:          01:04:31       well there's a federal thing for seven days for firearms. All right, can't just buy a gun. It was a federal Sunday. Seven days versus, all right, well that's actually longer, but still I think there's a, there's a real problem with anybody telling someone what they can and can't do it with their body. But there's also a real problem when abortions get later. Like when you're talking about like late term abortions, things get really weird when you're talking about like four or five, six months. Like I know a woman who got an abortion at six months. She had a chance to go to like some secret. It was in New York. She had a, there's very few doctors that were willing to do it. Her and her boyfriend were fighting over it. They were poor and she was pregnant. She wanted to keep the baby and I mean it was like more than five months.

Speaker 2:          01:05:14       So she wanted to keep it. He didn't. Yeah, but see the thing is giving birth to a child like that, in that circumstance, that is not the kind of child that you're raising right now. Right. Your kid is being infused with love and attention and positivity and it's like they're, they're already fighting before the kid is like born. It's like that is not going to be a positive environment and we're overpopulated.

Speaker 3:          01:05:38       No, you, you make some good points. And I think the good point, the counter to play devil's advocate would be the, or God's advocate would be that, you know, that kid could go to a happy family that was looking to adopt and have a wonderful life.

Speaker 2:          01:05:51       Maybe a wall or maybe it'll end up addicted to drugs. It's like it's not alive yet.

Speaker 3:          01:05:56       You're right. Well it's just not, but it can exist outside the womb and that's when things get weird. Late term abortions are really weird. But she got it. Yes, she did. And she didn't want to get it. No, she didn't. No, she didn't. They actually wound up having kids after that is really weird. And He loves his kids. He didn't have kids before then and then he loves his kids now. It's very strange. It's very dark. It's very, it's, but that is the gray area that is life. You know, life is weird. It's not as simple cut and dry. When people argue one side or the other, you know, and especially if they ignore the, the positives or the negatives that the other side's presenting. People love to have absolutes. They love to have, I'm right. You're wrong. They love to have, this is the right way. This is the wrong way. This is what God wants.

Speaker 2:          01:06:41       I mean, I guess that's what I'm saying that I'm right, but like I, I feel like I'm right in the sense that it's up to people to choose what they want to do with their bodies and themselves. And if they want to get on drugs or if they want to have an abortion, like don't make people raise children, which is probably one of the hardest things to do. I've never done it, but it must be so challenging and you have money. I have money. Like imagine doing it with no money. It just seems like to force someone to do that and make it almost impossible for them to get rid of there when a man has been the one who like did it to them anyway, it just seems crazy to me.

Speaker 3:          01:07:12       Well, they did it together. Hopefully.

Speaker 2:          01:07:15       No, I know. I know. But anyway, I would rather have a female in charge because I feel right now if you do not believe that women are equal to men, which a lot of a lot of these Middle Eastern countries don't believe that. It's like that is, you're part of the problem of keeping people back.

Speaker 3:          01:07:29       Well, there's certainly should be a quality when it comes to laws. Initiative certainly should be a quality when it comes to the way we treat each other. But we also should accept the fact that we're just fucking completely different, you know? And just leave people alone. Let them do whatever the fuck they want to do. And anybody that thinks that a woman who's pregnant for 40 hours or you find out, you know what I'm saying? You just find out you're pregnant, you've got pregnant two days ago, and that you shouldn't be able to stop that. Oh, what are you talking? Are we talking about like three cells take? What are we talking about? We're talking about a cluster that fits in that. The end of this stir mean,

Speaker 2:          01:08:05       I mean, well, there's a lot, I don't know. Everyone's specific beliefs. I just know that a lot of new restrictions in the New York Times last Sunday, they had a map full of all the new restrictions. And like now in five states you have to wait 72 hours and 10 more states. There's two followup visits that before you can get the abortion. So you have to start doing counseling. You know, you have to go drive two hours to do counseling appointments. It's like if you know, you don't want the baby, why do you have to go do counseling? It's just,

Speaker 3:          01:08:33       I think they're looking at it, and this is obviously it's gotta be, there's gotta be a religious perspective. Yeah, right. It has to be, but I think they're looking at it and not looking at it like a person. Like you didn't looking at it, a person that is lost and confused and they're going to give them guidance and that's all the way. A lot of like really fundamental religious people, especially Christians. And that's the way a lot of people feel like, like this person just needs to be taken in and we just take them into the Lord's arms and show them what they're doing is wrong. You have a baby inside your body, smells precious, gift kill you and you were just killing baby Kale.

Speaker 2:          01:09:10       What if you, what if you went around to everyone you saw and you were like, you gotta smoke pot. You got to do Jujitsu, you got to do everything. I do. Just do it. It'll make you feel better. Do it, do it. You don't stand outside sports locker or 14 million people a month, but you don't like passionately feel that everyone has to do what you know. It's like it doesn't, it's like do it for you. But this the, yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:09:36       Well I'm a big believer in let people do whatever the fuck they want to do as long as it doesn't hurt anybody else. And I think you are too. And I think that the real problem that people have with abortion as they think that there's another person involved, and it's not as simple as like, I should be able to smoke pot or I should be able to that think who's, who's standing up for that little baby inside of you?

Speaker 2:          01:09:55       That's why do these people care about people so much? It's like that's where it gets weird. That's compassion for a cluster of cells that can fit on a fucking coffee star,

Speaker 3:          01:10:04       but you don't give a fuck about war

Speaker 2:          01:10:06       war or, or, or the minimum wage or making sure that, that kids get great education. It's are these people just like donating all their time and money to help living people? It's, it's, it's so stupid

Speaker 3:          01:10:17       bid. How many of these people that are anti abortion, uh, are pro, let's go to Baltimore and clean up the city. Exactly. Let's help these people that are in like really low income environments that are filled with crime and let's give them a way out.

Speaker 2:          01:10:32       Yeah. It's like, oh, these people have such overactive empathy. They just, they just want to help everything. Even the clusters of cells that are living inside of poor strangers bodies. It's, it's, it's such a stupid way to direct their religious fervor. But

Speaker 3:          01:10:45       isn't it fascinating because isn't that part of what a person is? We're just a bundle of contradictions where it's so hard to be objective and logical about every single aspect of your life and that people will sometimes think that they're doing good and at the same time promote shit that's terrible and awful. You know, there's a lot of people that are like, I'm sure that we're like prolife an anti abortion that didn't give a fuck about that guy that got shot in Ferguson. They'd, right. You know, there's, there's a lot of people that think that you should execute prisoners, you know, for a variety of different things. They believe in the three strikes law. You know how easy it would be to commit three felonies if you lived in Compton. You know, if you're born in Englewood to a fat family filled with violence and you want to lock that person up for the rest of their life by the time you're 18 because they already have three felonies.

Speaker 2:          01:11:36       Yeah. They didn't get the opportunities. Oh, that is so fucked up. But I would love to see a pro life movement that just started like really trying to help re lives that are already like a functioning, why not that be the pro life movement? Yeah. The real pro life. Unborn babies in people who don't want them. Them's stomachs. Doms yeah. The real pro life

Speaker 3:          01:11:58       movement is like helping the lives that are, they're not turn into a murderers are not turn to a disaster. Yeah. I mean we're fucked up.

Speaker 2:          01:12:08       Are All these republicans that are running, do they all believe in abortion or they all believe that there's

Speaker 3:          01:12:13       Beano can't get through. You can't get through unless you're pro life. There's no,

Speaker 2:          01:12:17       Oh really?

Speaker 3:          01:12:18       You can't get through the maze. I've never even heard of of a successful up republican that gets to the end of the line. Really the backing and the religious right. I mean there might be one that people could prove me wrong, but that's pretty much it.

Speaker 2:          01:12:30       Like Arnold Schwarzenegger or something. But they'll probably like lip lip,

Speaker 3:          01:12:33       libertarian, libertarian. Yeah. There's a probably a few rare, like maybe a that Rand Paul Guy believes in pro choice. But yeah, it's, it's a religious thing for a lot. I mean it's, it, it happened with Reagan. I mean that's really, Reagan was the first Republican to court. Those like really radical religious people because they realize back then that there's a lot of power in that movement. The political power that you get from having the Christian right on your side. You know, there's so much does the organizing and the song so much power behind that. People that are just like, I don't give a fuck. Those people don't organize. Those people don't get together. The people that don't like leave people alone, let them do whatever the fuck they want to do. A lot of those folks don't have the, the drive to get off the couch and go out and organize and make sure that their views are expressed evenly across the board. But like Pete, when people get really religious and they think that God's involved and their choices, there's a lot of people that,

Speaker 2:          01:13:29       especially Christianity, there is this recruiting aspect to that religion that you don't see in Buddhism. You don't see in Judaism, you don't see really anywhere but Christianity or maybe you'd see it in some of the Middle Eastern religions. I don't know.

Speaker 3:          01:13:41       Oh, Islam doesn't recruit, but they, they promote the fact that there's, they're the perfect religion. They let people join, but Judaism's fucking hard to join.

Speaker 2:          01:13:49       I know you kind of like ask three times, you've got to like take like

Speaker 3:          01:13:53       my uncle did it. Yeah. Yeah. My uncle married a Jewish woman and he had to go through the whole deal. He had to go to Hebrew school and the whole animals like why are you doing man?

Speaker 2:          01:14:00       I liked Judaism. Why? Because it's more, well I was raised Catholic and Judaism is more open to like intellectual discourse and asking questions and having the questions thought about and talked about and where it's not as like absolute is like Adam and eve go sit in the hall. Like I was always just putting the hallway for asking questions and this is how it is. And it's like, how could that be how it is? And then you just get in trouble.

Speaker 3:          01:14:25       Yeah. But does it doesn't have to be a religion. I mean, isn't open discourse, isn't that just part of being a curious human being who's intelligent and I was, doesn't have to be attached to an ideology?

Speaker 2:          01:14:35       Well, I think that the ideologies can teach you things like tradition and, and uh, you know, there's beautiful things and probably all religions. And I think that the future will be not just like picking a religion and I'm the religion that my dad was and I'm the job that my dad was, my dad was a cobbler, Swami McCall blur. My parents were Catholic, so I'm a Catholic. It's such an outmoded, it's so outdated. I think as an adult you use sample, lots of religions and you, you learn about as many as you can and you form your own philosophies and pull from there there for us to pull from, you know, they're, they're all windows onto the same thing. So it's like why not learn? I mean I, I'm, I want to learn more about Judaism. I'm dating a Jew, I want to learn more about Buddhism. I meditate and do Buddhist chants. Like I love it all and I think it's like definitely a positive thing for your life.

Speaker 3:          01:15:22       I definitely think that looking into the ancient traditions and philosophies, there's the definitely something to be learned from it. What I have a problem with is attaching yourself to any rigid ideology. Yes. I grew up Catholic too. And for a very short period of time, my parents like didn't, they stopped me from doing it when I was in first grade. Oh really? While I was in first grade, I told them I would run away from home. I'm like, you send me back to the shit I'm going to, I'm not doing that. We're lapsed Catholic. Oh so bad. It was just rough. I W but before that my parents were getting divorced. So before first grade I was like, I was thinking that God was like the answer to all of this. Cause I was like really scared and confused and you know, there's like so much turmoil going on. I really thought that like that was the answer. Like religion was the answer and uh, cause I was just terrified. But then going to Catholic school cured me of that shit. Oh, there were so rude and mean

Speaker 2:          01:16:11       I had none and grabbed me. I was, you know, what are you doing? You think you're so cute. Take those socks off. Like anytime I try to like it, like be individual. Anytime I'd ask a question. They were assholes.

Speaker 3:          01:16:24       God doesn't like your socks. Yeah, that's a dark. Religion is a, it's a very depressing religion, you know?

Speaker 2:          01:16:33       Although I did go to the Vatican when I was in Rome last week and I did communion, no, not communion confession, because they, it was like through the rope. They're like, do you want to do confession? I was like, oh, well, yeah, I'm at the Vatican. What'd you talk about? Well, I just sat down and he asked me if I believed in Jesus. And I was like, oh no. First he goes, have you ever made abortion? Oh, that's the first thing he asked you. He goes, do you have any sense? And I was like, well, what did I say? I was like, Oh, oh, I, I told him, I was like, not really, you know, um, I don't really believe in this religion or something like that. And he's like, have you ever made abortion? And I was like, no. And he's like, and I, and I said, well, I do smoke pot and it helps me with my creativity.

Speaker 2:          01:17:14       And he was like, I go, is that bad? He's like against say, I don't know, like he was kind of seeing more Jewish actually. And then I told him I was, I was going to get married to a Jew and he's like, what can you do? And then he's, it was pretty cool. And then he was like, can you go to, can you go to mass once a year? He's like, I'm sure that, and then you go to temple once a year. He's like, he goes, what did he say? He was like, I think you can handle that.

Speaker 1:          01:17:38       Wow. Sounds pretty progressive. But I think they're trying to be more like that. You know, this is coming from the Vatican. Right. And I think that that was definitely an offset. An offshoot of that new pope. He's, he's dope. That new pope. I mean I'm not a fan of popes, but that guy is like the way he speaks about gay people, the way he abandoned the giant throne love. And I was Kinda like a regular chair that he sits down. He doesn't live in their apartment either. They have like a gold plated apartment or something. He got rid of the pope. Tmobile too. He's like a second to shoot me. They're going to fucking shoot me. Oh Wow. Yeah. Everything I read about him, I'm so inspired. Bulletproof pope mobile might shoot me, but don't shoot me now bitch. I got shit to do. I read that thing was so crazy.

Speaker 1:          01:18:26       This fucking aquarium, you're driving this paper. I have to look this up. I've never seen the pope Moby. Oh my God. Oh, this is what they told me when I was enrolled in. They're like, oh my God, that is a bulletproof Mercedes. Funny. The pope a driver on that thing, so he didn't get JFK aid. Well, they told me when I was in cope is doing a waving at 11 o'clock never heard of that before. I got to get a photo shoot and one of those things drive around my hometown and do a waving. I could see you in there for like Vanity Fair magazine driven around La. Oh my goodness. God, there's more than one. I guess they've, they've made a few of them over the years. Always be Mercedes only the best for pontiff. Okay, this is take America back from Rick Santorum released today. This is by the way, this is just the beginning of this wave of fucking stupid. It's thinly veiled racism in a lot of ways because it's taking it back, taking America back in. We'll take America back from these liberals and there's Obama, Barack Obama saying in a way they didn't say when Clinton was in office when they were trying to, they were trying to elect a Republican Post Clinton.

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       They didn't have this sort of take it back sort of mentality. This isn't, and this is weird, it will play this

Speaker 4:          01:20:29       unleash the fried like the prides of pit bull. This is him singing. Yes. I have to think so. Oh my God.

Speaker 2:          01:20:54       These lyrics that we're not hearing, it's like this is for the man work in the factory making drive train. This is for the farmer work in the wheat fields grow in the long grain. Seems like they're pandering. It's just like when you get those ads, like you start looking up a hotel and then like Google starts giving you those ads constantly. It's like they've just done a demographic search and they're like, these are the only hope for these people who are farmers and garbage drove a garbage truck. Drivers and like whoever that. Yeah, the laborers, they're like, this is no smart person will vote for us. So we must hander in the in the stupidest possible way.

Speaker 3:          01:21:28       This is for the preachers, the teachers. Here we go, the blue collar warriors, warriors, they're blue collar and they're warrior.

Speaker 2:          01:21:37       I says, not for the teachers. Anyone who's gone to college would not vote.

Speaker 3:          01:21:40       This is for believers whose dreams are on the line. Oh my God. Now is this Santorum actually singing Hampi. Okay. Boom. Gun toting, prolife homophobic, former United States senator will reportedly announced his run for presidency today after being edged out by Mitt Romney in 2012 Rick Santorum is throwing his hat in the ring. Once again, this time the campaign is on point. Judging by this official Santorum for president campaign song. Okay. Might not be his song.

Speaker 2:          01:22:10       Hello. Find out the idea that well, so the idea that there's like a Bush and Clinton running again too is so insane. It's mind boggling. I mean, I can't even believe it's a dynasty. Their, their, their royalty that we don't, we haven't figured, I mean it's Kinda good that there's other people trying, well, we tried with Obama had didn't work out so good did it. I don't even know if it did. Nobody is a good fucking president. There's no one has ever done it where everybody loved them. Not a single one ever because the ambition involved, it just excludes anyone. Cool. Especially today. Right?

Speaker 3:          01:22:42       With the intrusion, the amount of privacy, the investigation into your past and scrutiny. I mean, you can't be a human. You can't be a human. You can't have an ex girlfriend or an ex boyfriend. He can't have ever

Speaker 2:          01:22:55       puffed marijuana. I mean,

Speaker 3:          01:22:57       I think we'd be great with a gay president. I think we need a gay guy or a gay girl. How about a Lesbos? Lesbophobic good. Who would you go like Melissa Etheridge. She would take this fucking place in a good direction. You don't think Hillary would. A lot of people think Hillary is in neo-con. A lot of people think that Hillary, someone who is in bed with the military industrial complex, someone who profits from war, someone who is not like that. Well he certainly is. Uh, he certainly is a guy who is not what everybody was hoping for. Like everybody hopes he's going to close down Guantanamo Bay, pull everybody out of the wars, straighten up America's inner cities and same ad, the same brand of person, aren't they? Hillary and Obama. I think everyone that gets into that office has to be in bed with these monsters.

Speaker 3:          01:23:42       Corporations that need to make a massive amounts of money. And the way they make massive amounts of money is they bribe politicians. They pay massive amounts of money. Like when the Supreme Court pass laws that say that the, these corporations are allowed to donate money, like as if they were an individual entity. Like if you're a person like save Natasha Gera has $1 million in the bag and you're like, fuck it, I'm donating my million dollars to Hillary Clinton, you can do that. You can donate as much money as you want. What you used to be restrictions on corporations, especially corporations that would benefit from political influence. And you know of those, it's within the, I think it was during the Bush administration, I think it was. It was either Bush or Obama, but it's fairly recent that they did that. And as soon as you do that, you, you, you open the flood gates for corruption and influence lobbyists like law, that law, the idea of, I became educated about lobbyists because of the UFC, because of the UFC, had to hire a bunch of lobbyists in order to get mixed martial arts past and all these different states.

Speaker 3:          01:24:46       Because when we first started, it was only legal in a few states and lot of states, like right now it's legal in every state except New York. And the only reason why it's not legal in New York is because of corruption. And it's almost done. Nope. No. And the one of the politicians that kept it from being legal was just arrested for corruption. So it was hilarious when that guy went down for corruption. Everybody's like, Duh. Like it's the culinary union is a big part of it, but there's, there's a lot of union influence because long story short, the UFC is owned by this company that also owns station casinos. They own 20 plus casinos and they're non union casinos and they, the culinary union wants them to be union because if they were a union, they would make some somewhere in the neighborhood of $15 million a year.

Speaker 3:          01:25:31       Don't quote me on that. Uh, from the dues. So they're, they, they've had this act of smear campaign against the UFC and they spend a lot of money. They try to get the UFC to leverage them, to get the UFC, to turn those casinos and to union casinos. So there's a lot of fucking bullshit involved in politics. And that's the kind of things they're involved in passing laws. It's a lot of money, a lot of influence, a lot of people bribing people. So to get to be president, you'd have to play that fucking game. And there's not gonna be any white knights and that game, there's going to be white or nights, you know, like there's going to be darker nights and wider nights and it's this fine balance between public acceptance and public support and the support of the corporation. The corporate, you can't have, you can't have one without the other. You got Kinda like walk this fine line.

Speaker 2:          01:26:17       That's why we keep getting close. He makes no sense.

Speaker 3:          01:26:19       Friends. I don't think it makes a difference. I don't think it makes a difference. I mean she's, she's already been criticized for being unduly influenced by, I mean that whole thing with her email. She deleted all her fucking emails and she was getting emails from a private server instead of the, the way you're supposed to do it where it's in, they can easily investigate all of the, uh, the transactions that have gone back and forth or the communications that have gone back and forth. I try not to look at it too deeply because it's so frustrating. So I can only give you like a cursory understanding of how the whole system works. But at the end of the day it's, it's money. I mean it's all about money and these huge fucking corporations. The difference between having someone in then supports them and having someone in there that's against them as PR, especially when it comes to environmental regulations and how difficult they make it to do things like fracking and all that kind of shit. It's billions. You're talking about billions and billions of dollars, so I don't think anybody gets there unless they play that fucking game. Then that's why the commission for presidential debates is a privately funded institution. When you see those people debating on TV, like what does that, you have to leave

Speaker 1:          01:27:30       but just you don't have to like write it down on a piece of paper. I wish I didn't have to go but I have to. Let's do it again. Listen, you and I have been threatening to do a podcast forever and we finally did it. I got here because there sometimes for hours, no, and I was like, why have it til one does fine, wine is good. One is good. Natasha, you don't have to worry. Listen, let's do more often. Come back. I'm so depressed now. Why? Because you were thinking to, Hillary's going to be the the block Obama for women, that country Western fuck.

Speaker 2:          01:28:04       You know what I mean? How they're just like purposely just dumbing it down, dumbing it down for like,

Speaker 3:          01:28:10       well it's a hustle. It's like a guy who wants a rape you, but he shows up with flowers. He's trying to get you to think he's a good guy.

Speaker 2:          01:28:16       Who's the best person to be like, do you think? Like if you had to pick a Bush or a Clinton for comedy, it would be a Bush, right? Yes. US like we'll have like a glory day or glory period. Right? Comedian. Yeah. Like people. Yeah. Cause people would want to go out to the clubs and talk about it. You know?

Speaker 3:          01:28:34       I don't think we're, we're supposed to think that way. There's plenty of dumb shit going on in the world without having it be.

Speaker 2:          01:28:39       Oh, I'm not saying, I know. I know. I'm just, I'm just thinking. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:28:41       Here's my hope. I have a hope. My hope is that the Internet is so pervasive. It's so deeply embedded in everyone's life and the Internet is all about the exchange of information and information is being exchanged. New Information. Yes, and it's

Speaker 2:          01:28:59       way words Noo

Speaker 3:          01:29:01       new and not just that, but facts. Knowing the reality of climate change of, of a, of war, of profits. The reality that we have when it comes to like understanding what's going on in the world is, is, is unprecedented. It's instantaneous. You have questions about that. You can't be lied. Like you know, I remember Ronald Reagan on TV lying about the new studies are coming out that says that marijuana is one of the most dangerous trucks ever known that was going, he was a liar. He was lying to people and because they were paying the lot, if a politician tried to do that today, the Internet would fucking explode. Everyone would go nuts. It was like, we remember when Obama wanted to go into Syria and Obama was saying that we've got to go into Syria and literally the entire Internet went fucking crazy. The entire country was like, fuck this.

Speaker 3:          01:29:50       We're involved in two fucking wars and you want to go to Syria. What's the big deal about Syria? What exactly the fuck is happening in Syria? You think that what everybody's done that is going to, I think the Internet, what the Internet represents is the exchange of information. I don't think the voice of the Internet, I think it's human beings having the truth where they've never had it before and having the ability to express themselves in a way that they've never had before and all they would have to do to change all this shit really change it, is abandoned. This fucking antiquated bullshit corrupt system and have people vote online. How you could help people. You have people try make transactions. You could fucking do your banking online. I've got apple, Pam, I'd phone. I could buy shit online. Everyone's doing things online, but you can't vote online.

Speaker 3:          01:30:33       That's ridiculous. The reason being, if you make it really easy to vote, then really everybody has a say instead of having the way they have it now where it's this, you know, you have the electoral college and you don't really vote. You vote for a representative and that representative represents your state or your district. It's all cocked bullshit. It's nonsense. What they need to do is revamp the system and revamp the system in a way that reflects the actual will of the people and that will radically change the world because the will of the people is educated now in a way that it's never been before.

Speaker 2:          01:31:04       How do we make that happen? How do we raise money for a revamping the electoral college?

Speaker 3:          01:31:10       I think slowly but surely the system that's in place is more and more ridiculous every year
