Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Brothers, what bitches Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by the fleshlight, but you know that right? This ain't your first Rodeo. If you go to Joe Rogan.net and click on the link for the flashlight and entering the codename Brogan, you will get number one sex toy for men at 15 percent off. Wonders of wonders, way better than masturbating, but I gotta warn you and you feel like a fucking loser once it's over, especially when you're cleaning that bitch, but it's worth it. You will shoot big loads and they will make you think clear, right? Denny? Just like fucking Kundalini Yoga. Basically the same type of shit. Clean the mind open. The pipes release the hounds were also brought to you by [inaudible] Dot Com, o n n I t, makers of Alpha brain, a cognitive enhancing supplemented I am on right now. If you're like, Hey Joe Rogan while you talk so smooth Joe Rogan, why you got all those words at your Beck and call Yo Dawg?

Speaker 1:          00:01:06       I'm on Alpha brain and people like, hey man, what's the science behind alphabet? And go to [inaudible] dot com. All answers will be given o, n, n I, T, and we're constantly looking to improve that. Any criticisms that we've had the past, we absolutely appreciate it. We are actually about to start a double blind study with um, what's that mean? Like to, to blank. Like shut up. Shut your out Brian with this double line. Well, you got to fucking read online. Needed to read Google, Google, double blind spot on the street. Suddenly the disrespect site on the street as you take the fucking bill, you drink coconut water and you jerk off into the cup and you look in the Cup afterwards. That's fucking mind boggling right there. Okay. I, that's the fucking deal. Do you take the two pills? Whatever the fuck. CEO. We're also a.

Speaker 1:          00:01:49       We make a shrewd anyway, so people that have been asking for more tests, tests, so we're on that. It's going to work. We're spending a lot of money to make sure that this stuff is all legit. It is legit for me, I use it. It works without a doubt. No questions for me. I've tried it, I've gotten off of it. I've tried it again. I've fucked with myself as much as possible to see it placebo effect. It's not there, it's legit. I also love shroom Tech Sport, which is the [inaudible] mushroom supplement, a supplement that, uh, it aids your, your body's aids in your body's ability to process oxygen really makes a difference in any extreme exercise. If you're into Jujitsu, if you take like Kettlebell classes are into crossfit or anything like that, you will definitely find an advantage. You will definitely feel an effect of the shroom tech sport, but if you just like a regular person who doesn't exercise or you barely exercise, don't, don't waste your money back.

Speaker 1:          00:02:39       If you also go to [inaudible] dot com, we also have a shroom tech immune which everyone should check out. It's fascinating and the way it works, the way it's been explained to me, I'm obviously no scientist, but your body recognizes this mushroom different mushrooms than the shrimp tech support. Your body recognizes it as a possible disease or a cold, so your immune system fires up for a fight that never takes place and so just really generally boost your immune system. I, I am a big believer in a bunch of different things to keep your immune system strong. I'm a big believer in this room, tech immune, but I'm also a big believer in probiotics and everyone should look into that. I have no financial stake in this, but drink a Kombucha tea. You know, a lot of people have been, um, just just talking so highly about the benefits, the health benefits of this stuff, you know, for years and years.

Speaker 1:          00:03:27       And I never, I did it when I first came to la. I tried it, but I was like, the stuff tastes kind of nasty. It's a weird sort of an acquired taste. But then about a year or two years ago, I started drinking it on a regular basis because gts, Kombucha and they make synergy and all these different, uh, different flavors. They started selling them at whole foods. So it was like super easy to buy. And I started drinking them all the time. And one thing I noticed is I stopped getting sick. I think it has a big difference when you take in a live organisms like probiotics, whether it's Acidophilus, that's another great one to take and spend the money and get that shit that you have to keep in your refrigerator if you can afford it because that's what you really want. They're really healthy live cultures and essentially what it does is you know these live cultures act as a security force and they fight off all the country cultures, so any any country bacteria that you come across, you want to have these probiotics at your beck and call like a live army to fight off the cons of the disease world, so look at it that way and this is by the way, nothing that we sell, but get your ass on some acidophilus.

Speaker 1:          00:04:29       Get your ass on some Kombucha tea checkout. We also have a new mood which they five htp enhancement supplement and what that is is a five htp actually helps your brain, builds serotonin and interesting stuff. If you were on antidepressants, they recommend you not take it because it actually can give you too much serotonin along with your antidepressants together. Combined is not so good, so talk to your doctor and all that stuff, but by itself, if you're not on any medication, it's absolutely safe. Just don't go crazy and take the whole bottle in one sitting. You fucking freak. You're on cocaine today. No, no. I'm healthy. I'm healthy and working out. I've been working out for the first time in months, man, about this fucking pulled muscle. You are. You're on fire today. I did kettle bells. I did. I kicked the bag. I'm a fucking.

Speaker 1:          00:05:11       I'm back. Bitches. Oh Shit. Anyway, go to [inaudible] Dot com o n I n o n n I t o n n I t.com entering the codename Rogan and you will get 10 percent off. Most importantly when you order every order that you get is 100 percent money back guarantee, but only for the first 30 pills. And he say why? He used to be 100 percent guarantee all the time because the world is full of concrete. That's why. And because some douchebag thought it'd be cool to odor a fuck load of bottles, get all of his money back and then sell the bottles on Ebay. So because of the cost of the world, even as you make a big order and you decide somewhere along the line that you don't like it, you can't get your money back. So if you, if you do want your money back and it's a big order, you have to send in the unopened bottles. The first 30 pills though you can eat them, you can stuff them up your ass, you can throw them in the toilet, whatever the fuck you want

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       to do with them. And then tell us I don't like it and we give you all your money back. Why? Because I'm in a weird position. I'm in a position where people are like, what do you try to rip people off? Absolutely fucking not. But I do believe in this stuff. And there's only one way to sell something. You believe in it. You got to sell it and make it as easy as possible for everybody. And make your intentions as positive. And as clear as possible, and I don't think you can be any clear than offering someone 100 percent of their money back. If they don't like the product, you don't have to send it in. You don't have to do shit. Just if you the first 30 pills, just take them. And then if you don't like it, you get your money back. Also, if you think it's too expensive, I urge you, go to the website.

Speaker 2:          00:06:38       All the ingredients are clearly listed in the exact doses by all this stuff in bulk. And save money and do it at a discount. Make your own Alpha brain. Try it out. I don't care. Use other people's stuff. Have a good life. Eat nutrients, take vitamins, eat healthy food, eat fresh vegetables. Get Your Dick sucked. Every now and again, am I right Joe Diaz? Come on, am I right? Eddie? Bravo. Fucking old jokes. Add that in there too. You've got some old couple jumping jacks. A little swimming. Let's kick this. Kick this motherfucker. Here we go. Joe Rogan podcast, my life.

Speaker 2:          00:07:20       Thank God men like Nick Diaz exist this weekend. Nick Diaz and Carlos Condit. Thank God those guys exist. Thank God those guys exist and thank God those guys have built themselves up to the point where this is one of those matches were five fucking round, man. You can't wait. You're gonna. Be Palm sweaty. Rubbing your hands together before that bitch. I don't know who's going to be the referee for this. I don't know who it is, but before that one person looks at the Blue Corner and works in the red corner and then said, fight. That shit is going to be crazy. Carlos Congo, who's been trying for eight years for the fucking fight, fucking training. Every two months they change a folder. It's perfect. He said, 19. Fucking apologize. Batman. He's on one. It's really for him. I think it's perfect because he's. He's so prepared. It was a perfect time for him.

Speaker 2:          00:08:05       You know? 60 plus 1:30. The line is not that bad. It's minus one six. You would be crazy to pick a favorite in this fight. I think he'd be crazy. I think that this is one of those who the fuck knows what's going to happen. Fights this could be. Who knows? It's going to be amazing. That's Roy Nelson to tell about that. Oh, how about Hanan Barao and Scott Jorgen that Hanan Barao dude, he's the dark horse of the pound for pound division because he's not a champion yet, but he might be one of the top pound for pound guys. He's right up there with Aldo. He's a beast. Did you see his last fight with brand picket? He hit home boy with a knee to the face with no jump. Just fucking leapt up with this knee, you know, instead of that thing where they lift the front leg and then they come up with the right leg. They'll start with the left leg and then they use it as forced to kick up with the right leg. Some of these bad ass Brazilians like Anderson can do it too, where they just fly through the air with one knee and just lifted that knee up and crack caught. Caught Brad Pickett in the chin. I mean, he's a beast. Do M is Jujitsu. It's fucking sick. You know, as soon as Brad Pickett, like stumbled and he saw position, he'd jumped on that back. So quick man. It was a thing of beauty man.

Speaker 3:          00:09:18       I saw the UFC special on Nick Diaz. Carlos condit. Which one? Episode one Shit, I don't know. Episode two. I don't know if it's aired yet. Is it the one where they haven't been years like kindergarten teacher. She remembered neck. Remember Nick, and this is. I learned a lot about nick and I come up with a hypothesis. You know before, when was in the early days if you were a black belt in Jujitsu, shit, you had a shot at the title and then it became if you were an Olympic wrestler, damn you have a shot at the time. Now it's obvious now it's becoming more like all other sports, like if you didn't wrestle, do Jiu Jitsu and, and worked on striking since day one as a kid. [inaudible]. There's so many kids doing that. All three now. You don't want, you're not going to have a shot in the very near future.

Speaker 3:          00:10:08       And I think there's one. There's one more factor, and that's the Nick Diaz factor. There's obviously he doesn't like cameras. He's, he said it a million times. He doesn't like to talk in front of cameras. He's not, you know, um, you know, he's, he's, he's, he's not into it and maybe he shy in front of the camera or whatever. And his teacher was even saying that he wasn't the most vocal guy and, and, and he had trouble expressing himself and all that shit. And um, when he gets in that cage and that door slammed shut and the crowd is roaring, there's no more fucking talking. He just comes alive. He looks at his opponent is like nobody can fucking hear you. You can be the most articulate, funny, charismatic guy on the fucking planet. But you know what? I fucking run all day. Swim all day, do box. I got a crazy Chen. I'm gonna fucking kill this motherfucker. That's like a, that's an x factor right there. If you didn't like, you have to look for that. I think in the future in fighters, like do they have that switch where when they fucking get in that cage, it's just, it really is like life or death. His is a very good, a

Speaker 2:          00:11:19       different thing than anybody else's. First of all. His approach to it is so different than anybody else's in that he does like endurance training, like long distance marathon type training and basically forces these guys to try to keep up with them. I mean he basically puts them into an endurance contest and tries to get them to keep up with them. That's why he does a lot of juking and lot of getting in their face. All that stuff tenses you up, all that stuff. All those punches that he throws at 50, 60 percent, all those tighten you up. You know, one of the things that frank shamrock said was that when, when Nick Diaz was punching me, pitch you so often you can't breathe. You don't know when to breathe. You can't relax because you, you never get to relax because they're, they're just, they just keep coming, which is just different.

Speaker 2:          00:11:57       He just, he just fights in a different way. I think the way it does it is brilliant. It's so brilliant because no one else did it before him. No one else figured out that that way to fight no one else really would not just have great skills, but have ridiculous worldclass endurance like swim from Alcatraz endurance. That's the shit man. They said they went through a countdown. He sparked like some ridiculous amount of rounds that he ran five miles and then he swam for an hour and a half. That was just one day. He just does that all day. You still maybe maybe he has some kind of condition where he's obsessed with exercise. I don't know. I mean, I think he loves it for sure. I mean, when he was a kid, he said that he, you know, he, I think he said it was one of the countdown shows. His, uh, his, uh, think it was his uncle or someone was like a track coach. Yeah. He used to take him, his grandfather, Danny. Proper ghosts.

Speaker 4:          00:12:47       But that's the other thing too. The other thing too with him, you know what? He doesn't like fucking talking. You smoke a joint. What do you feel like? Do I go for a fucking run? See what happens to you. It feels great. It feels great. It feels open. Joint. I go to fucking swim fit for an hour where you feel like fucking Hercules' when you. That's my world. I love this fucking world. Smokes weed. What his insurance comes from from going, I don't want to hang out with these dumb fucks is I might stab somebody. I'll just smoke a joint rental, left the fucking highway. Where's law? And he runs the fucking two hours. When I lived in boulder, I used to smoke and run and the high when you finish fucking run is a complete different dimension. Yeah. Even when you smoke and lift man, everyday feel you feel all your muscle tissue.

Speaker 4:          00:13:26       Like when he pressing weights, he feel it. You feel your whole body moving and swipe in. At Roland they say, well, not just at Yoga and smoking the way you're supposed to do, and I used to eat it to take a little piece of banana bread or a little hash cookie. I take it in seven in the morning, go to 8:30 years old. You know, my head is at 8:30 and the bitches smoking. Yeah. And I would just go into it little by little and it's amazing. It's fucking amazing when you walk out of there, you don't know what agent you really don't. So that's what my thing is with him, that he just, you know what, he's not the type of guy that's going to go to a club or whatever. What would you do? Smoke, smoking. Joe. He's the last guy I'd

Speaker 2:          00:14:05       want to fight because think about it, like compare them to GSP and even John Jones and Anderson Silva that what he has, they don't have. Maybe they will develop it is he will stand right in front of you and exchange with you and he's down to go to war right in front of you. I mean, not very. I mean, GSP ain't gonna do that, Jon Jones probably won't even do that and if you decide to take him down, he'll fuck you up on the ground to his Jujitsu. It's amazing. What the fuck are you going to do that? What are you going to do with Nick Diaz? And he was killing you. Going to do with him Cyborg. You was killing sideboards standing up. So sidebar took them down and whip armbar within 30 seconds he had him in an arm bar. I mean, GSP might be able to take him down.

Speaker 2:          00:14:51       What is he going to do? He's not going to pass this guard. He's not gonna pass. Nick Diaz's guard. He doesn't get tired when you're on top of him either. You know a lot of dudes, man, you put them on their back and they just get exhausted. They get demoralized, they get exhausted unless we see his chin fall apart. Man, I don't, I can't see him lose. Well, you know that can happen to some fighters when they take beatings. No, that can't happen. We've seen it happen over and over. You know, and vandelay and so many guys, chuck eventually that they had iron chance and they would come even if they got randomly, never had an iron chin. Vandelay got dropped a lot. Soccer. Robert dropped him. A lot of people dropped them. Henderson had. I'm really badly her. He just was a lot worse. Now.

Speaker 2:          00:15:32       It's a lot worse, arguably, arguably, but you know, he was already just this dude who ran face for first. You know, he did. One of the things that made vandelay great was, Whoa, how reckless he was. You know, he didn't give a fuck. He would charge that. You literally like a wild dog. You know, he built like a pit bull just running at you. But that style, it gets you hurt. You know that style. I mean he's not, it's not a coincidence that he's the only guy of his era that had to have facial reconstruction so he could breathe, you know, his, his nose was flattened, smashed flat. And if you go and look at his face from when he first entered into pride and then his face in his first UFC fight with chuck, he's a completely different person. You didn't even recognize him.

Speaker 2:          00:16:11       He was a handsome guy when he first got into interpride, who's I have fucking some guy vendelay look at values. Hot. Pretty sexy. I danced with him. If he was cute. He was a sexy. It was a completely different looking person, you know? No Kara as well. No, Gary's face looks way different to. How about nate fucking Diaz? Holy Shit. And it's like a carbon capo. Nick Diaz. Nick Diaz is. We don't just have one that's fucking incredible. He was just like maybe a year behind Nick Diaz sort of in development. It seemed like maybe in Jujitsu was a little behind and in the striking striking power. And now he's like caught up to nick had some weight problems to where he didn't cut the weight. Right. And now he cuts it right. And now he has way more energy because when he went up to one 70, you know, he had some fights where he looked bad ass like the rory mark and fight holy shit.

Speaker 2:          00:17:01       And I thought, man, you know, this kid is draining themselves too much to get down to 55. But then he figured out how to do 55. Right? And he came in and the goal fight just fucking lit me up. But serone fight was even more impressive because he did it for three fucking rounds. So it shows that he's got endurance at 1:55 two. And he lit cowboy up. Man. I mean that. I thought that was going to be a crazy close fight. It's like sort of how I feel about this condit fight. I don't know what the hell's going to happen. I look at it, I'm like, man, both guys are tough as fuck. Both guys have mad skills. Both guys can survive. Some dudes can't be the nail. You know, some dudes can be the hammer, but when they the nail they fall apart.

Speaker 2:          00:17:39       Conduct doesn't fall apart. Man. And Connie got bombed on by Jake Ellenberger ellenberger had him in all sorts of trouble and ellenberger puts people away. That kid hits fucking hard. He's one of the hardest hitting guys at one 70. And he bombed condit and conduct, covered up, weathered the storm, and came back. That was the first fucking around man. He was in all sorts of trouble in the first round where a lot of lot of referees would have pulled that trigger router. A lot of referees would have stopped that fight if they didn't respect him and they didn't know him. If he was like a new guy into the UFC, how did that fight end? Again, he wanted a decision what? A close decision, but it was a great fucking fight. But what it proved to me is that conduit is no front runner. He's a dude that is in it to win it.

Speaker 2:          00:18:18       The Rory Macdonald fight. Another perfect example of that third round came back and stopped him, lost the first two rounds, came back in the third round, stopped them. And that kid is a fucking phenol man. That Rory Macdonald, man, he was a fucking elbow. He got it. He crushed them on the ground. He broke his face open on the ground. He, you know, contents on animal. He's a real fucking killer. That guys is straight killer. What he said in that countdown show was bad ass. He goes, I want the rest of the referee to rescue. I want the referee to come in and save your life. Save your fucking life, man. And that's the way to do things like that. That that's a killer man. I mean, if he wasn't doing this, he would be somewhere working for the military that I wrote. I always said that about him.

Speaker 2:          00:18:59       He's a killer. He's a fucking kill him. And that natural born killer. That's not just a nickname. You know, you can talk all that tough Guy Shit you want. What happens when you actually get in there and you're throwing down when that guy is actually in there and he's throwing down, he's a fucking stone cold killer. They both are. They're both stone cold killers. Neither guy is going to be scared of the other guy and both guys are going to be just going in there ready to just let it all hang out. This is going to be a crazy weekend.

Speaker 2:          00:19:27       I wish I wasn't working. I wish I fucking get Kenny Florian to fill in. I want to get hammered. Sit Cage summit. I'm going to take. It would be an honor to to call this fight. Don't get me wrong, but there's fights like that where I wish I could just go. Oh, got you. Gosh. Checking my peers. Yeah. Oh yeah, you kidding me, man. Both peers. Peers is dangerous for everybody. Here's why. He's one of those guys that eventually he's going to catch on. You know, eventually pierce is going to hit his stride and he is going to be Johnny Hendricks and dudes. You know, like Johnny Hendricks just took out finch. There's his wrestler dudes that are just. They're striking is slowly getting better, slowly getting better, but the power's always there. It's just a matter of figuring out how to put face to face and they're getting better at it.

Speaker 2:          00:20:09       And Johnny Hendricks, man, the way he put out John Fitch like that with one punch, I'll tell you what, Johnny Hendricks hits anybody with that punch. Anybody and your Foxville fucked. That guy hits really hard. There's some guys who watch them hit dudes in the cage and you know, you know, you say, well, hey, that's a strong guy. That's an athletic guy. Hendrix is one of those guys. He's got that extra. There's an extra. There's some dudes when they hit you, you hear it. When you hear them hit the bag, you know you're not ever knowing when you hit it. I hit the bag and they go, this motherfucker's got that extra pop to it. That's what Hendrix has gotten you here. The have that or you don't have that. I mean, you can certainly make your punching power better. You certainly build your muscles up a bit, put some weight on learning how to turn your body into things better.

Speaker 2:          00:20:51       But some dudes just know how to throw and that Hendrix cat knows how to throw and sodas. Pierce, he knows how to fuck. Especially that left hook. Oh, who he's got power and cost check to man. Caustic is dangerous as fuck man. That man, he was fight. That was, that was a brutal assassination man. You know, that was a, it was a brutal ending to that fight. Which you kind of knew what was gonna happen stylistically. You like, well here's two really good wrestlers, but one of them had stupid knockout power and the other one you know, has been knocked out a few times. It's not, it's not the best stylistic matchup for Hughes. You know, now he's going to fight again. Who's looking for another fight? Hughes man, he's an hoists gracie. They should make that happen, man. He'll kill hoists. That doesn't matter. It's good rematch.

Speaker 2:          00:21:31       Hoy's wants it really bad. No matter what happens. If I shouldn't be, I shouldn't say always because you never know. What the fuck is gonna happen and who's great. She's a legend, but based on that first fight, I would hate to see that again, unless there was something wrong with it is he's claiming he was sick or something. I don't know who he. His voice is an all time great. He's the original legend. He was the first Jujitsu Guy, the first guy to show the world. If it wasn't for him, I would have never known. None of us would have ever known if it wasn't for his accomplishments in the ultimate fighting championship. None of us would have ever known, but that was a long fucking time ago. You know, and errors. They pass for reason and at a certain point in time, your body just has not moved the same anymore.

Speaker 2:          00:22:07       You know, and the world passes you by and when that happens, you got to step aside, man, you got to step aside. You can't just be going out there and getting knocked out all the time and get hurt all the time because it's just, it's just reality. You know, reality. There's a certain point in time where all of us are going to be dust band and the only way this sport really works is that we stop people from competing when they hit that point because they don't believe it. The same thing that makes someone, a great fighter make someone say, no, you're all wrong. I'm going to prove the world. I'm going to go out and one more time I'm making a comeback that. But that's, that's how guys get fucked up. But they got to decide for themselves. A voice wants to fight. I want to.

Speaker 2:          00:22:41       I would love to see Hoist Matt Hughes. He wants it. If Matt huge wants, wants another fight. That's a great remark. What if you got them mad? What if he was good on his back? Just like before. That'd be bombing them in the head. Dean would come in and stop it at the perfect time. I don't know, man. I don't want to watch that fight again. I don't want to watch what happens. I love voice too much, man. I love that guy. I think he's like I said, he's a legend. He said he's not going to get killed. They'll tap. I don't want to. I want to see him fighting that in the end. Unless there was something really wrong with them and unless he's different now. I. You want it really bad. I think that's good enough. You know? Who else wants Hughes? Who Your boy?

Speaker 2:          00:23:19       Mike Hardy. Oh Shit. Damn hard, he's been calling them out and hard to do a good fight to him. Apparently. That'd be a good fight. Yeah. You don't think it'd be able to take Dan hardee down fairly easily. Oh, Dan's worked really hard on his rest. I'm assuming he's working like day and night on takedown defense and diffuse goes back to the way he was wrestling when he was at his peak. I mean, if that's possible, if his body can still do that, man, remember those days, like the saccharide days when you, you know, people forget how dominant that motherfucker was. You know, he was dominant man. He was like, one of the first dominant wrestler is actually that learned submissions too, so he wouldn't just beat you up. He started strangling guys taken back. He started getting armbars frank trigg. Fuck Ya. Beat him twice. Twice with a rear naked choke the second time after he got kicked in the balls.

Speaker 2:          00:24:07       Yep. Those were great memories. Picked him up and walk them across after. After Frank trigg was bombing on them. Frank Trigg, God is back and it looked bad, but frank trigg does not know how to finish that joke, his know how to defend or finish and that he was picked him up, walked into the middle of the fucking cage and threw him against the ground. It was awesome, man. It was awesome. That was like one of the best moments like mma moments come from behind, you know, from being stuck, got kicks you in the balls, hit you with a bunch of shots, takes your back and this is that in a rematch of a fight where you fucked him up in the first fight and he didn't want to fight him in the second fight anyway, and then he starts winning and then he was just mustered all up and turn it all around.

Speaker 2:          00:24:45       That was amazing. That was some amazing shit. Yeah. Some good high guard action in that fight as well. Seeing that a guy like he was. I mean I think he uses a great fighter, but I think a certain, a certain number of knockouts, the they have to step in and stop you from doing that. Whether it's your family, whether it's your friends, whether it's, you know, your boss, there's a certain amount of times, you know, I've talked to a, there's a, a guy that I know very well who is a brain is a traumatic brain injury specialist and what he deals with is rehabilitating people and um, and helping people like with all these mental imbalances that people have due to traumatic brain injuries. One of the things that happens is your body stops producing testosterone. You get really lethargic, you get depressed. Like that happens to a lot of guys that have a bunch of head injuries.

Speaker 2:          00:25:32       They get depressed. The apparently your brain can only take like a few concussions in your life who needs to retire right now, who, I would never tell any of them to retire. But there's a few dudes that I would, I would pull aside and I would say, you know, think about this a little bit. You know, who I don't want to say because I'm in my position, you know, being a commentator. But there's, there's a lot of, um, any, any dudes who have been knocked out a gang of times, but there's guys that violate that shit. Like Alistair Overeem, Alistair overeem been stopped a bunch of times. Dude, he's been knocked out a gang of times. How many times? A lot. I would bet he's been stopped at least eight times. Damn. Yeah. Yeah, he's been. Chuck knocked him out. Okay. Badr. Hari knocked him out in, in, in, in kickboxing.

Speaker 2:          00:26:17       Um, what does that big dude that used to fight king of the cage? Real angry guy. Hoffman. Bob Hoffman. Bob Hoffman knocked them out. How about Bobby Hoffman? K Odem. I'm Shogun Kod. I'm, I believe I'm a bunch of dudes. Stopped him at a bar. Oh, Keratan off. Knocked him out. A bunch of dudes stopped overeem. But overeem figured it out, man. And one of the things he figured out, he was just too fucking small. He was too small at two. Oh five. You know, when he moved up to heavyweight. But then again, Keratan a pink Keratan of Jack intimate heavyweight. He started, you know, I don't what, what changed in him? Man, what changed his ultimate dedication? What changed in his intensity? What would change, but no one's ever turned it around like overeem. No one's ever gone from being stopped like eight times and you know, back when he was fighting at two.

Speaker 2:          00:27:05       Oh five. As you know, in mma, he was thought of is, you know, a tough guy, a tough guy, but a guy who would gas out, he goes from that to be the first guy to win a world title in both MMA andK , one kickboxing. No one's ever done that before. No one, everyone that k one Grand Prix and one in mma title and looks like that. You know who the fuck looks like? Alistair overeem means the Goddamn Superhero in a comic book. He turned it around. So when you got a guy like that, you kind of can't say anything. You know, you look at Mirko Cro cop and you go, man, I love Cro cop. He's a legend. He's got one of the greatest highlight reels of all time. Those head kick knockouts, one after the other, but at a certain point in time, how many times can cro cop get knocked out before someone doesn't want to, you know, you feel bad for them, you know, you know what's amazing, the alertness of the whole concussion thing, like everybody's hip to it now.

Speaker 2:          00:27:55       Like I was watching 60 minutes Tuesday night and they interviewed Roger Goodell, the, the whatever, the NFL and a Monday he reviews tapes to see who gets concussions and they showed a guy hitting another guy, like a wide receiver getting hit by a defensive back and he pointed to the defensive back getting the concussion. It stayed in the fucking game. So they're finding them know if they. They stay in the fucking game with a concussion because you know, you don't want to go to fuck out. You're rocking your plane. You know what I'm saying? So you don't even feel it, but it's amazing how the guys are standing voluntarily. So who the fuck are you to tell a dangerous man? It's really dangerous in the football players. They're finding out now you know these guys, by the time they even get to college, a lot of them are fucked up.

Speaker 2:          00:28:41       That dude who remember that dude who died, henry something. Henry died in a back of a pickup truck filled football player really recently. Do you don't know what I'm talking about? Him and his girlfriend were arguing. He jumped in the back of a pickup truck and try to google that shit. Brian, if he can. Henry something. Henry football player, dead pickup truck. Anyway, the dude died. Don't dump about Olin. The dude died and he was only 28. I think they. They checked out his brain and the brain of like an old man, it was. His brain was all fucked up. His brand showed massive damage because he had been kod. Who knows how many times. By the time he got to the pros, you get killed in high school. You get out and junior high school. I talked to a dude who had a fucking 11 year old son and his 11 year old son got knocked out for a half an hour and they put them back in a month later, a month later that kids playing football game and I'm like, you're crazy. What are my students got knocked out? And Chris Henry. Chris Henry. Yeah. Yeah. That was his story. He doesn't say anything about his brain. A Cincinnati bengals football player. Chris Henry died after he fell. Hold on after he fell.

Speaker 5:          00:29:47       Oh Shit. It just went away. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:29:52       he fell off the back of a pickup. The back of the APP.

Speaker 5:          00:29:54       Pickup truck.

Speaker 2:          00:29:57       Fuck man. These guys, man, they don't realize a lot of people they had no idea. So they would just throw in these people back in, over and over and over again. And now they're starting to put it together. When you went over there, Joey,

Speaker 5:          00:30:08       what are you doing? Chicken soda.

Speaker 2:          00:30:11       Well, one of my guys got knocked out last weekend and the amateur show and he wasn't knocked out completely. It was controversial. Almost like the rest stop that it could have. It was on the fence, whether it was early or not. He got up right away and was complaining. He was never out, but he was like a little rock. I didn't complain about the stoppage. It looked. It looked legit. He got rock standing and then got taken down a couple of ground and pound against the cage. He never was out, popped up. By the time we got backstage, by the end he sat down. He didn't remember anything about the fight. Not One. I don't remember anything about the day. He wasn't even out though. That's the crazy thing. He wasn't even out and he doesn't remember. He didn't remember the name of the hotel we were in. Well, you remember when we saw Tim Sylvia, we were in the hotel bar.

Speaker 2:          00:30:53       We're waiting to get our car to the airport and it was the next day after he fought randy coture, he fought five rounds against randy and lost his title and he came up to us and he goes, dude. He goes, I don't even remember the fight. And he goes, uh, I, I remember the, the, the bell ringing. And then I remember sitting in the corner asking, uh, my corner, what rounded was, and now it's the last round. And he's like, what the last round, like you just fought five rounds on instinct. He had no idea what happened. He got hit with one righthand early in the fight and just had no idea what happened.

Speaker 5:          00:31:24       Wow.

Speaker 2:          00:31:25       Yeah, that's what you don't. We don't. You know what, that's why it drives me crazy when someone would call a fighter a pussy. Oh, this guy, you know, he never brings you the fights. Like a wet blanket. You go get your, you get your fucking brains rearrange Sun. You get someone shit and kicking you up the side of the head. You know, there's a lot of guys like criticized guides for being boring. You know, it doesn't bother me at all. I don't, I mean maybe I don't necessarily want to see them, but I respect what they're doing. I respect like, like Antonio Mckey, a lot of guys give him a lot of shit, you know, because he, you know, he kinda like wrestled to the ground. He never never gets into standup exchanges with guys too much and it doesn't take any damage, but that's the key.

Speaker 2:          00:32:04       He doesn't take any damage. Yeah. Might not be the most exciting thing in the world, but if you want to fight, that's really. That's a smart way to fight, man. Smartly. If you just closed a closed shop, clothes, everything, there'll be no punching that we know nothing. There'll be you on your back and be punching you a little bit here and again, but nothing crazy because I don't want to get submitted and then I'll win every fight. You know, it's, it's not the smartest way to do it because it's a, it's a sport and you're also marketing yourself. It's entertainment, but I understand that. I'll never call one of those guys are pushing. It's a smart way to fight, man. What'd you think of these fighters? Last weekend was tough match ups, you know, first of all, uh, the Damien Maia fight Weidman do cut a shitload of weight.

Speaker 2:          00:32:41       He took that fight on 11 days notice and you could tell when he was in there, he, he struggled. And even Ray Longo gave it away in the corner. Ray Longo said, you know, I saw what you went through yesterday. I saw what you did yesterday, you can do this. They said that his, his cut was horrific, but he, that kid is so fucking tough. He just did it. And he went out there and he grinded on Maya and he wanted a decision. But you could tell by the end of the first round he was dead. He was dead walking. And My, uh, luckily for him was dead to Maya Look, look like really? Like I heard he had a flu or something like earlier in the week. He did not look good either. So both guys, it was a, it was a real endurance issue, you know, like I was talking to Jeremy Piven at Germany and was like laughing about it, know, because I didn't interview them and he's like, would you have said to them?

Speaker 2:          00:33:26       So it's safe to say endurance was an issue in this fight because it really was like, it was kind of, you know, it wasn't the best fight to showcase mma, you know, but it was just a circumstantial situation is nothing you could do about it. You got one guy was a fucking stud wrestler with all this God potential that Chris Weidman could be the king of the world someday. He could be the John Jones of 185 pounds. He's a, he's a beast. He's a wicked wrestler. He puts guys to sleep. You put Tom Laurdis leap with that fucking darce choke. He's nasty man. He's strong as fuck. I saw him fight Galvao in Abi Dhabi. He avoided everything and he got golf vowel in a fucking. Doris didn't tap him, but the fact that he was able to sink it in and lock it up and had galvao fighting to, to, you know, to, to get his legs under him and to defend.

Speaker 2:          00:34:11       Pretty fucking impressive for a dude as a wrestler. I mean, I don't know what is Brazilian Jujitsu rank is, but he's one of those kids that, you know, he's really fucking strong willed, really smart, and he's just a winner. There's some dudes that are just winters, man. They could have a torn meniscus, they can have a fucking herniated disc. They take you down anyway. They take you down. Anyone they still strangle you while they're in pain. There's dudes that can just force force through shit like that. And that's Weidman's one of those, man, he's a fucking animal. And then Damien Maia, you don't want to think about my man. He's in limbo right now because my at one point in time was just taken everybody down and strangled them. He was all Jujitsu and that's when everybody loved him. He was nasty, but somewhere along the line he figured, you know what, these nate Marquardt, these guys, I can't take down.

Speaker 2:          00:34:52       They beat the fuck out of me standing. I got to get my stand up better. But in doing that, his Jujitsu is just not the same. It's not what it used to be. You know, he submitted to jail sonnet and he submitted at Herman. He submitted all these guys. He was strangling people, man. And it was nasty when, when he got you on the ground, you were Foxville pulled guard on those guys. He refuses to pull gardener Chael Sonnen. He hit it with a fucking lateral drop. You remember? I mean he was nasty but. But his stand up is not good. He's a mechanical, like he moves like the whitest guy on earth. You know what I mean? Like if you look at the way he moves around, he's got like this and he does the same thing over and over again. He paused with the right and then throws the left pause with the right and then throws the left.

Speaker 2:          00:35:32       It's way too predictable, you know, he needs to. That guy needs to. If he really wants to work on a stand up, he needs to go to Holland and just hang out with tyrone spong for a year. It just do what that guy does. Move the way that guy does, you know, go, go train will go con Saki, go train with, go to Mike's gym and workout with Melvin manhoef. See the way those guys move, you gotTa, move like that. Imitate them, move the way they're moving. Do those kinds of combinations. Maybe your body doesn't exactly move the way that body moves, but try to emulate it. The best strikers all have a particular style like specially kickboxers. They all have a particular style. You Watch men who fight, he moves and he throws, Fain Tito's feint, boom, and he throws kicks. He's got a very particular way of moving and that the way of moving is the way of an elite striker.

Speaker 2:          00:36:18       You know a dude like when you see it was that dude's name Shale Sanderson. You ever see that? Do a wrestle. That dude gets low and he moves on dudes. There's guys that you look at them, you look at the move around on the mat, you go, that's a fucking killer. You know, like Mark Schultz back in the day, you would look at Mark Schultz, move around like that is a killer. There's a certain way that guy moves you like that's an elite wrestler, no doubt about it. There's a way he hits those, hits those take downs. It's elite. You gotta imitate those guys. You gotta if you want to be a real striker, you got to figure out what those guys are doing it, figure out that style and then do it. Apply it to mma, but you've got to imitate the way they move. And right now Damien Maia does not move the way those elite strikers move, you know, he's so good at Jujitsu.

Speaker 2:          00:37:02       I know that he could be good at everything else, but it's kind of a leap, you know, at 32 years of age, it's, it's tricky, right? How many is about 32? I'm not sure how old he is, but I, I really think that, that, um, him eliminating the pulling guard strategy as really hindered his game. I mean, there's only three things you can do in a fight. You can fight standing where the dude, you can try to take the guy down or you can pull guard. That's all you can do. And Damien Maia always had that third option. Most MMA fighters, most of you seen fighters don't aren't good at that third option, their guard isn't dangerous enough to pull and attack. Look at Paul Harris, Paul Harris, that he who? Who is the guy beat. They put her in a leg lock. Oh Mckenzie. Oh yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:37:47       That guy. I'm that guy. Could have been an Olympic wrestler and a k, one champion. And Paul, it didn't matter to Paul Harvey. He took that out of the equation. He took us through a little shot and he pulled guard and went right after his legs. He bypassed the superior wrestling. He bypassed the superior striking. He had the third option. Most fighters don't have that third option. Damien Maia was one of the few that did have the third option. If he was having trouble on his feet and he couldn't take the guy down, which comes up all the time, having trouble on your feet. Can't take the dude down. If you don't have that third option, you're going to just stand up and either lose a decision or get knocked out. And, and that's, I would love to see Paul Harris and Damien Maia. And remember at the height of Damien Maia, he was pulling guard.

Speaker 2:          00:38:33       He was taking shots. If he didn't take them down, he would pull garth. He would sweep them, get on top and attack. He's not doing that no more. He decided, some, someone convinced them that just be a striker to stand up, try to take a guy down there. So many guys out there that he's not going to be able to take down. And there's so many guys that he's not going to be able to strike with Wa Weidman. Yeah. What are you going to do now? And you know what he's, you know, he was tired and sued for both guys. Weren't in the best shape for that fight. They both obviously had some sort of physical issue. Would it be didn't if Weidman was at his best. It's a terrible fight for him. It's terrible fight. He's not going to take the. But if he would have been the old damen meier where he would have taken a shot, you know, sprawled, he would've pulled guard.

Speaker 2:          00:39:14       His guard is dangerous enough in submissions and sweeps where he could have did something to Weidman, but he took that out of the equation and then he decided to kick box with them and now all those years of Jujitsu, he's so good at Jujitsu. It's not even in the game. It's a kickboxing match. Why would you do that? You know, if you can't take the guy down, the drag them down. Otherwise you have to kickbox and my is not a kickboxer so stupid. I look at Paul Harris, look at bars. What he did, he took a lazy shot. The guy sprawled and sprawled right into guard. Went right to a leg lock. The fight was over in. Those blocks are ridiculous, dude. His legs are ridiculous. His legs are ridiculous. That was watching him move around and I was like, this dude has like grapefruit stuffed into his cafs.

Speaker 2:          00:39:59       Cafs really looked like that. Nobody's built like Paul. People should watch that fight. Pahara his last fight and look at that as a serious way out of a fight that you're having trouble and if you're in a fight and you're beating them standing, fuck it. Stay standing. You've got this motherfucker. Don't take them down. If you can take them down. If it's pretty easy to take him down, take him down, get on top, but if you can't strike with them and you can't take them down, which comes up and so many fights, it's so common. You got to have your guard dangerous enough so that you can pull guard either with leg locks. You know, whatever liquid Baha'is look at early Maya. Yeah, he's got to figure it out, but too bad. His Jujitsu is awesome. It's awesome. The old days watched him is awesome.

Speaker 2:          00:40:44       He's definitely got to figure it out though. It's fucking crazy. Game, man. The fight game. It's a ridiculous game. Ridiculous way to make a living, man. We want to talk about the craziest, most dangerous way outside of war to make a living. That's it, right? Imagine getting pushed into face everyday training. Yeah. I can't fucking shit again for sure. Every fucking day, 10 fucking years. I remember when I first, uh, the thing that really got me thinking about what kind of damage a striking does to your head was when I started transitioning from taekwondo to kickboxing man because I was a novice. My striking was not very good. My hands were not good. I could punch hard, but I didn't really know how to box yet. And I would go in there with guys who didn't know how to box and even if they weren't punching you hard, they were hitting you a lot and you just go home and you're fucking what would lie in bed.

Speaker 2:          00:41:31       And my head would throb foam, foam, foam, foam is that terrible female. Like what am I doing in my brain? No, this can't be good. Lying in bed with headaches after a sparring session. That shit can't be good. And he'd go everywhere. The, the light would hurt. Like I wear sunglasses because he was. The light would like hurt when your head is pounding from getting punched in the head. Shit is so bad for you. That's why Jujitsu so beautiful. You get the, you get the thrill of the kill, yet there's no brain damage it except you know the guy who scares everybody the most. It's Paul Harris because everybody else just kind of taps you out. Paul Harvey's rips your legs apart. He rips through his legs apart. I mean he just gets a hold of your leg and like, sorry ain't walking right anymore. That's it.

Speaker 2:          00:42:12       You be legs. Fuck for like a year. Good luck. He might be the first guy to leg lock his way to the top because if he just keeps doing what he's doing, what is he doing? He's not really striking too much with a little bit. He's just going to shoe and you're gonna sprawl because the shot wasn't that good. He's not a wrestler. And then he's going to pull guard right into your legs. So what are you going to do against that? You can work on your takedown defense all fucking day to your head explodes. He's going to pull guard on you. He's taken all your wrestling and just throwing it out and fucking garbage all you're striking. You're wasting your motherfucking time. He's just going to take a shot and pull guard. He's a beast. It's an amazing talent and skill to work on and not.

Speaker 2:          00:42:54       I don't think that many fighters. Um, well, I know not that many fighters are working on it and Marsha, they should go explore what's. So how much did you love Chicago? Sweet. Do you have a great fucking time but still fucking spending. Goddamn, we had fun, right? The fucking stage, man. It was overwhelming. That was one of the best shows we've ever done, I think is the best show we ever did. When I walked on stage. I had a study for step for a second, like the weed and the fucking stage hit me all at one shot. I couldn't digest my brain. It was like I had a concussion for the first three minutes. It was very surreal. And then once I got my time and go and it was all over, but it was very surreal at first I could absorb it. I'm used to doing the feeder with a bottom of the top, not a bottom or top of the other top on top of that. Another top on top of that filled to the brim of the people fucking yelling. They know who the fuck you are. The energy level.

Speaker 1:          00:43:44       Esther's parents. Just everything about the show is nuts. The line after we heard little esther's parents wouldn't let her, didn't want her to take her to the UFC or didn't want to take her. They just didn't want to drive. She lives about 40 minutes outside of where the UFC. They didn't want to drive and go to the traffic and the traffic was nuts. Yeah, they were Nice, nice people. Nice to us. I don't know what they did to her to make her a little less gray. Lebeaux drive with Damien fucking great guy. Dan Dan is awesome. She was um, she, she fucking killed dude killed and she went on after Joey. Joey lit the place on fire and then little lester goes up and I mean, she had a fucking killer set dude. She's got some great jokes. She's, I, I really. I'm going to send this to her parents and I'm not bullshitting. I go. She's way funnier than I was at her age. She's way better than

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       I was at her age. She's, she's going to be a killer man. You know, she's right now. What is she? Twenty three or something like that? Hold the sheet. Yeah, 23, 23. I was blown away. The night was great. The fans are great. The people I talked to was great, but my night was made with little, uh, parents where they don't have parents come on. Great. Is that for your parents to come see you in the theater? They know. Not just your parents. See you. Anybody could see you when you were on hbo and you got your hour. I'm talking about the night that it hits you. It hits their parents. Finally, what their daughter was really doing. You know, you come home as a kid, you're like, Dad, I want to fucking jump off planes. What? You're going to come work in the factory with me.

Speaker 4:          00:45:11       That's it. What? Nobody in his family ever jumped on the fucking planes. Fuck you. You're going to die. And for two years, that's all you get is torture. And then finally something you know and every family has, I'm not going to come see you. You know, your father is not going to come see you. He doesn't approve of you boxing and all of a sudden one night you followed us. Come and you know what? She just wasn't with Jenny on a bunch of girls. She was with killers. She was with Marines from the comedy store bootcamp training. They went to Canada Pendleton. I followed Paul Moody. She was dead. So I seen her growth right there. When she got off stage, her little face. I had tears in my eyes. Doug. I was, I was so excited for her because you can't describe that, uh, parents with that pro.

Speaker 4:          00:45:54       Yeah, she was a, it was incredible. It's the best show. It was the best show we ever did for sure. The biggest show we ever did to now I've never sold out that many people. We sold out that whole place. It was like 3,300 seats or something. It was nuts. That's nice man. 300 is giant. Giant records of it. I've got videos of record, right? You saw another guy that had a desk squad tattoo. Yeah. Another guy on a desk. Squad Tattoo Joey Diaz shirts. I was just fucking overwhelming. I'm going to email you this. You could put this on the thing. It was very. It was very just, it's just to fucking. I had a hot beef and Italian sausage Combo Sandwich that I almost stayed there. Almost fucking moved their red band with hot and sour peppers and sweet peppers is the beef. I mean this shit was fucking delicious.

Speaker 4:          00:46:41       The restaurant went to the first night was delicious. The fucking Fogo. The second night when went to that state, it was just fucking done. My asshole life Sunday smelled like I had firecrackers and they're like, I have gunpowder in. My Shit was heavy duty meat. They put heavy duty gunpowder in the meat and Chicago. That cattle is the real fucking deal. They got Deca in it because my asshole, I had a light candles and the fucking hotel. It was hard. I walked, you know, Joey and I were uh, we were staying in a corner of the hotel and so we had our own. We had a door that would go into this area and then he had a door and I had a door, so we had like two doors. It was like our door that to get into our little area and then we each had individual door. I would open up my door in Chicago, by the way is fucking 30 degrees outside. He's got his windows open and you hear the wind whistling in like a haunted house.

Speaker 4:          00:47:32       I would open up the door and literally say, it wouldn't sound like, you know, like there was a hurricane going on in the next week. You know, was still sweating at night. You got to go to a doctor, so I was still sweating to listen to dog. I walked into the doctor's office yesterday for my preop. I walked in there a quarter to nine. I hadn't smoked reefer, didn't smoke reefer. The night before I had 10 hours of sleep, drink water. I was relaxing on my blood pressure was at a 45 in the morning. One 85 over 100. No, that's horrible. That's fucking murder. Then after they took the blood out, it went down to like 1:40 over 90 and that's okay, but it's still not acceptable. You know what I'm saying? My engine runs hot all the time. I take the medication, I take the. Well, you lost a Shitload of weight at one point in time. Don't matter. How much did you put back on? That's it. That's it. I'm 95. I was shocked yesterday. I was even shocked yesterday, but some of the weight I put back, I lifted. I fucked. Some of my legs are strong again. I mean I'm trying to fucking really do this. I wouldn't want to get in shape. You can be an in shape. Fat Dude. You know what I'm saying? Like it can't be opened your titties and shit like that.

Speaker 4:          00:48:43       I really fucking try at this. You know what I'm saying? I take my pills, I drink a lot of water, but if I'm eat, if I'm in Chicago, Joe Rogan, you're not going to go to weight watchers to suck my fucking salad. We always eat salad, mixed Greens for breakfast. I eat fucking oatmeal. I'm real careful about. Not eating too much, but we had like two hours, two hours because my blood pressure a little bit better shape. I got to figure something out for blood pressure. Straight vegetable diet. That's the best way to trim your body down.

Speaker 4:          00:49:47       Fifteen hundred pounds. Plus I probably gained 20 pounds. When you're that big, how do you know? Because you go to a regular scale. I always kept thinking. Got The fucking meat scale. They got to where they give you the Jihad attack where they shoot the speed and you get on the fucking bicycle and start running the ship. And that day was for fucking 15. Oh my God. So that's the biggest he ever. That was November of 2009 or something. And I said, no. He goes, come back in January and we will put you on a, on a diet that fucking, you know, the lap band, whatever. Oh. And I was, you know, I'm scared of needles. That's a couple of times you got to go see that motherfucker. Not just a scared and Nino thing when people break those things many times is Ralph. He had that operation.

Speaker 4:          00:50:58       Ralph. He had the other. Yeah, the other one. The bypass. He broke it though, right? He busted the needle. Snap the fuck. Well, he made us. He made them a smaller stomach and then he broke through it somehow or another. Some overstuffed themselves. I don't know. Why didn't you have him on your podcast? He was talking about how he almost died. He was very good man. Yeah. What did he say? It was just one of those fucking things. He was light. He was burnt down. Do you look at a guy like Dan? As long as this bitches alive. Catcher, canary bird, pull mine. You know what, man? I know how hard it was for him to travel. I know what it was like to get on a plane when you're 415 pounds and the seatbelt don't even fit in fucking firstclass. Okay. I know what it's like.

Speaker 4:          00:51:41       How to walk out, how your joints hurt. That's why I love these personal trainers that you know. I, I go to north Hollywood parking lot guy, 400 pounds walking around the park. It's not going to work. My friend, it's going to last three weeks is a tap out. The joint pain is unbearable. Put them in a fucking pool and make them eat vegetables and shit like that. You know, and I know what it's like to sleep. What it is a joint pain. That's the real issue. It's amazing. It's amazing. And every time you fucking fly, your ankles swell up and he's flying to eight times a fucking week. You know Ralph constantly on the road every week. He's on the road already. How bad is it? He's on the road already. So he's in Tempe for superbowl weekend. Eight fucking shows the whole fucking. So he stopped.

Speaker 4:          00:52:21       He stopped smoking weed. He stopped smoking weed. Is he eating it? Nothing. No. Wait. You can't do nothing. Oh, that's so sad. Why did he stop? Because because of what? He had blood clots in his lung or something like that. How would we. The hurt that it affected his lungs. We did all the smoking it to smoking it in the fucking flying and the fucking, you know, not breathing and it adds up after the whole thing. He would make all that traveling fun, you know, they do. They do all these tests on marijuana and they do tests on the guy like Eddie Bravo, who's a normal weight yourself. When you add 400 pounds, it's got to do something to your fucking lungs when your lungs are this big and you're trying to. What's going on Brian? Oh, that's what's going on. Fucking essentially found treasure affects you at every level.

Speaker 4:          00:53:07       Man. The reef is just something that they told him to stop smoking as a precautionary measure, but I think the smoking anything is probably not so fucking good. Nobody, you know, there's no evidence that it causes cancer. It's very different from tobacco smoke. We have smoke all putting in the same category, but it's not. It's not. But there's other options. It's got to do something to you that I've been smoking for 30 years. I've coughed. I've split fucking colors. Fucking smurfs. The whole thing. Something's gotta be going on with your life. You know, these people sit there so well. Harvard did the research and that's great. It's got to do something to you. So you got nothing is fucking free, you got to pay somewhere along the fucking line. So knock it the fuck off. Reading high time. Some scientists would a be with sandals on.

Speaker 4:          00:53:49       I don't give a fuck. I'm telling you that somewhere along the line smoker, for 30 years I've been smoking weed for fucking dirty is. And I'll tell you what, I know for a fact. I got that seat. The whole PD. I know for a fact that OCD, no POCD pocd shit with your lungs when you hear the little bells and whistles and your lungs. So you know when you right now you're ever going to be breathing on the have you ever still below me breathing on the microphone. You're fucking stupid. You ever do a thing on the microphone? You go join me here. You're breathing. You hear you breathing. Do you hear any breathing? That cop did something. So what I usually do is look at the fuck up. Don't look at that look acronym. What? Remember, I used to take the steroids that used to breathe in and it gives you a fucking know that the one doctor said as my asthma.

Speaker 4:          00:54:43       Yeah, so what I used to do is whenever I hear the bells and whistles, you just go run around three labs. Both claims are that really have been doing that for years. Whenever I hear a bell and whistle that museum walking enough cock suck and get on the blow the whistle. Did you get that thing that Brian's got you. That's great. That's great and shit, but you just got to get out and walk. Forget computers. Right? But the beautiful thing about that, it tells you what you're telling yourself. It tells you how much you're doing

Speaker 6:          00:55:09       and if you think you need it and you're. You don't have any money, just write on a piece of paper. You're lazy. Fucking put in your pocket. And that's what I've realized that, that, that what I do, look at it and I'm like, Oh shit, I'm lazy. I know this already. I could. I could have saved myself $100. And so you're not. You're not changing your habits. And I can see myself trying to beat my score before I can kind of see that, but unfortunately I just had this lifestyle that I'm so fucking busy that the only way that I can change that, it's just to make sure I work out every day where this is more like for people that I guess, uh, like have time, more time to try to jog more is totally doing a totally different approach to what we're doing. Brian is working out solely so that he can get more pussy.

Speaker 4:          00:55:52       That's fine. That's his issue. That's why 60 percent of people take fucking steroids. Had an athletic. I'm telling you, you go to a bar, there's 18 guys looking around. You think they'd gone from Ms Dot Olympia and you're like, where do you live in Glendale? So what's all these weights for? For what? To Do, what? To be a bartender for like a buck, a local club. Not to pick up pussy. That's a lot to steroids. Not really. No. You just looked like a fucking tree trunk, but you don't do steroids. Okay. You like the barbarian brothers? Eight 36 seconds for the last three years. Every fucking day. Well, Brian is just doing it to keep up. It's got a freak on the line. That's what he's gonna do I need a couple more people don't get fucking serious until they got shredded until they get rushed to the hospital. This obesity epidemic in this country isn't til you get rushed to the hospital with two coming out of your ass and you'll be at the gym doing jumping jacks borough or you're gonna fucking die. When did it, when did it affect you? When did you really start thinking, I've got to do something when my fucking spine was hurting, when I do blow, blow, blow back of my neck was fucking gone.

Speaker 4:          00:56:55       When I would do blow, when I would have to wear underwear to go to the gym because I was pissed my pants because I couldn't catch my breath when I was throwing punches with Jesus Christ when I fucking realized it and I knew that I wasn't going to get the operation that wasn't not gonna fucking work at all. So I knew that I had just eat right. And you just can't deal with the idea, but it will. You were also talking about it like it was like a weak thing to do. Working out the I should know. Yeah. People think in this country. Everything Bro. Look at that fucking kids we've got now a kid has a fucking bad day. They put them on a fucking pill and then when they get older, the computer crashes. Now I got to put them in London. They have a nervous breakdown.

Speaker 4:          00:57:32       You're going a little league and fucking Sherman Oaks. You know you can't yell at the kids to Stryker. You suck or swing. These kids are fucking pimp. But that's why half of them on fucking pills guy. So what you're trying to tell me is I can go to burger king every night and he'd like a fat slob. I'm 35 and call Mr. Lap band and get my shit together. And that's what you're telling this country. So half of these motherfuckers gone for the right thing. You got to, when you're 400 pounds, you're not sick. It's your character. Something's not right. Something's not right. So if you get up and walk to the corner every fucking day, eventually going to get bored walking to the corner. So you're gonna walk another corner, then you're going to walk another quarter national. Don't even walk to the YMC like I did and you got to get on the bicycle for five minutes and there's 10 minutes and it all helps out.

Speaker 4:          00:58:15       See in my world, when you're a comic, you think that you only come home Mondays and Tuesdays. So if I work on Mondays and Tuesdays and what's that gonna do for me? Nothing. Not True. Even two days a week [inaudible]. I didn't know that. That's the mentality I took him like, you know what? I'm fucking snow blow. And the sick thing was that always kind of worked out at the. I always lift the weights. I always did fucking something. You know what I'm saying? I wasn't like, so that's why when I got sick and bothering me, but I felt like I was too much behind the eight ball get you're about to get knee surgery. Fuck yeah. And I'm ready. I just, like I explained to you yesterday, you fainted on the way up from the fucking. You don't even feel limitation. I mean it's 2012. These new vampires. You don't even feel the fucking needles.

Speaker 4:          00:58:52       They could fuck you in the ass 80 times and you won't even know it no more. Listen, I put San Tan on my ipod and I looked the other way and two minutes later the bitch bent my fucking arm up. I didn't feel the fucking needle. I didn't feel the fucking need ipad. You put an ipod all the time. When I go to the dentist, I put something on why sit there and look at Bela Lugosi when I could fucking every fucking dentist look like Bela Lugosi to me when they're looking at your fucking mouth. You know what I'm saying? You don't feel rude, but just tuning out, know that most dentists have tvs. My fucking wife goes to a place that has fucking big screen tvs with headphones and one dentist because he would ask me stupid. You know, he was just uncomfortable. I'd have like really bad conversation, like clunky conversations with them.

Speaker 4:          00:59:36       I was like, when you get your fingers in my mouth, what is the talk about listening? Let's understand each other. I'm going to lay back and open my mouth. Tap me when a tap me when I'm fucking done enough. Tap you if it hurts because that's what they say. Tap. When you feel the drill or something, you put the fucking ipod on. You. Close your eyes. You're not in there. Eddie Bravo. What's happening? Cock suck. You're a month away from having a kid. You're sitting there like fucking Buddha with no fucking food. Talk to me. I love ready for this man. Are you ready? You got to be fucking ready. Don't this shit? Hell yeah. You got to be ready. Have you picked a name yet? A TV show on discovery. I want you to tell me you went to your uncle's house and change some diapers for awhile and we tried that.

Speaker 4:          01:00:15       Well, this was planned. This was not an accident. I want her to kid. I'm proud of you. I'm happy if it's going to be a fascinating experience, man. A different fucking man for sure changed me as a human being. First of all was the refund. When you came to me, you said you had the best ice cream Sundae in your life. The way you gave it. To me, that was beautiful. And then next thing you know, Mrs Rogan came on the scene. I seen the whole thing. I will never forget that day Eddie Bravo got me high. We we went and had an ice cream Sundae and I had the most massive revelation in my life. I couldn't believe how God damn good. That ice cream Sundae taste was the first time he ever straightened up. Before then, you were fucking ape was still bent over. If I drew you a banana, you need to fucking pill. Seriously.

Speaker 4:          01:01:03       When you were back, you were back. Your chest was up. Well, you guys know me. I don't know me as well as you guys know. Please. That was it. You will walk different person. I'm a lot more relaxed and everything, but it must've been interesting. Much more for you to watch someone change their personality. So fucking beautiful thing, man. I love to see evolution. I, but people watch it. I love to watch people. Shut your fucking mouth. Let him walk into that whole, you know, don't say no, but I think coming from, you know, my background, you know, like doing martial arts competitions my whole life and then just transition right into comedy. I had never relaxed. I never settled down. I never, I never learned how to just be calm, you know? It was my, my whole body and my brain, my personality all developed under duress.

Speaker 4:          01:01:52       It all developed under physical combat all the time on a regular basis. Constant training, constant fight, constant tournament's. That was, that was my life from the time I was 15 until I was 22. All my formative years was all spent in stress and I remember when I first decided that I wasn't going to fight anymore. I was like the first time ever in my life when I was like 22, my, my last kickboxing fights. I've the first time ever where I could relax. I would always be nervous. Like, when is the next? When's the next fight? When's the next thing I've got to get in shape. I can't be drinking this. I can't be doing this. Couldn't live my life because I was always worrying about getting my ass kicked. I was always worrying about like, I have to make sure that I do everything right or to be prepared. I don't want to get fucked up, you know? So it's like, it's, it wasn't the best mindset to go into stand up comedy for, that's for sure. It's like a constant battle because stand up comedy, you've got to totally the opposite. You've got to not give a fuck. You know, you gotta you gotta be relaxed. You gotTa have fun instead of be tents and ready to go at any moment's notice. You know,

Speaker 6:          01:02:48       you sent me a. by the way, whatever you sent me, it doesn't work. One of them doesn't work. The other two do. Check your email. You sent me two things and both of them are like movies that are one second long. What? Here

Speaker 4:          01:03:03       again dude, I know it's. I know it's good. My full reascended okay. Fucking 15 to 22. My mind wasn't fighting them. I wasn't a fighter, but I was in a different type of hell. I was in my own head. I was putting myself into, you know, it was so weird when I became a comic, what, six, seven, eight years later or something like that and how I took that wildness into the fucking comment and nobody understood what I was saying until I met you guys store. I filed the fucking home. I was always. I used to travel on the road with trible and do all these little roads. I remember when I first met you, the store, everybody was fucking terrified to you. Yeah, it was crazy. Nobody knew you and I, I remember being like the only guy, like when I first met you, that was like, he's great.

Speaker 4:          01:03:44       What are you talking about? I love that guy. I never was like, Oh, here comes Julie Diaz. Like, where's he at? I like with gravitate towards you because you didn't scare me. You were nice to me. You weren't a scary guy to me. You were a regular dude. I see. You were like one of the only guys there that I could relate to. There was like a lot of guys that I couldn't relate to. I knew dudes like you, you know, I mean, not you, but you and my friend Johnny B, the Pool Hustler, very similar characters, man. Very, very similar characters. You have both way out there. You both like not give a fuck guys, and you're both guys that were like polarizing. Some people would love you to death and then everybody, you know, there was a lot, a large group of people, but for whatever reason, they'd be upset at you.

Speaker 4:          01:04:24       Like I remember having to defend you. Even I rare even dom irrera was hating on you for every body, every and I loved it. I fucking love that because that's what I, you know, it's so weird that this whole surgery thing really taught me about fear. My fear has fucking done wonders for me because that's why when I wake up in the Molesta, first thing I fucking do is grab my fucking cock because for years I was scared. I've always insecure that immigrant fucking thing shizzle into my fucking mind. Since the streets in New York City with the immigrant thing, not knowing the language, not feeling good enough like everybody else, not beat a fucking American and it sits inside my fucking soul. So for me everything has been riveted on fear. Every time I get on stage, it's like the other night fear was real in Chicago.

Speaker 4:          01:05:09       I got on stage in between the reefer and whatever was going on and the lights. I got fearful man, but you know what? That's normal to be scared. That's a great emotion, especially when you're a stand up comic because the more scared you are, the better you're going to fucking do. Especially in my case, the more riled up I am. Two minutes before I go on stage, the more energy I'm gonna give that fucking audience. But I've looked at my life and I've seen how much fear I was petrified to go get that fucking needle even though I fucking knew nothing was going to happen and I was going to walk out of there, but I went in. I took the needle after I walked out at me like, what a fucking killed 10 fucking people with my bare hands because you overcome one of your biggest fucking fears.

Speaker 4:          01:05:47       Till this day I get little emails and people, you know, I, I suffer, I suffer, I suffer from a social disorder and I don't know what to do with the answer and taking a fucking pill. It's checking your fucking confidence and grabbing your balls and walking into a circle and saying, fuck it. I'm here. You know, my mentality was always go into the mouth of the lion and put a chair down and sit the fuck down and let the pieces fall where they may. And if you're not going to live like that, fuck them more. I'm at the store too. Fucking nights, Joe Rogan. The first fucking night Eddie Griffin bumps me. You know how embarrassing that is? You become a regular on a Sunday. The first fucking night you let bring 11 people that come see you. Your landlord comes and you get bumped by Eddie Griffin and the second night I go up there and Steve Greenstein says to me, Hey, last weekend you fucking audition here for missing.

Speaker 4:          01:06:29       You said one of my jokes. I said, it's February 11th. I just come off a plane January 29th and you're already accusing me of being a fucking thief. And remember he had his violin case. Who? Steve Greenstein, I don't remember. What was it? Creepy guy. Older guy that hung out at the comedy store and he had a violin case. So this is a Tuesday night. It's black night at the comedy store. It's 8:00. The main room is packed with the original room would be empty because people were scared to go up there and black knight because we're going to get fucking mug. So the original room was always empty. So Steve Greensteam was up before me. He, this is my second night, the comedy store. I just got away. I'm a fucking criminal. I've been in prison. I got all these problems, but I, for the first time in my life I got a little fucking daylight.

Speaker 4:          01:07:07       The comedy store, this lady made me a regular all my life. People were like [inaudible] in you as Mitzi shore scene you. She going to make you a fucking regular. I get down there. I'm a regular is the first time since my mother died. I had any luck. I had been in prison. I had been divorced, you know, shot the whole fucking deal and the next thing you know, I become a regular. It's Tuesday night and I get off stage and I'm waiting to hang out for a little while and Steve Greenstein comes up to me and he says to me, dog, one of your jokes is like my joke. I said, which one? He said something about Oj Simpson's made. I go, Doug, I didn't steal the joke for me. I just fucking got here two weeks ago. Wheels comes out. He goes, this guy didn't steal the joke from you.

Speaker 4:          01:07:42       The only problem was the guy put the violin case behind this fucking legs and I spotted it. So he starts threatening me. He's like, don't even next time you do that job, we're going to have a problem. I just pushed him. Joe Rogan. He fell over the violin case. Why has these fallen down? Mitsis Limo pulls up. That's it. I'm like, I'm done. This is my life. I'm fucking Gone Outta here. I'm never going to get another fucking spot again. I'm going to go back to selling. Fucking blow and wheels got between us. Scott Day got between us and Mitzi came and go, oh, what happened here? And he started saying, he goes, no, this kid's Cuban, blah blah, blah am. But Mitzi seen the kid on the floor and fell in love with me after that because I pushed that motherfucker. She liked something from myself. Sure. You got lucky.

Speaker 4:          01:08:22       She was crazy. She liked that happened at the FEC and Improv. I would've been out on the fucking street. How often did you perform at the Improv? Now in those days? In those days. Every week because the Guy Richard Cooper loved me, the talent coordinator, but I got to La January 29th. That was a regular at the store. February 19th on my birthday. I didn't fuck around this town when I got it, but you couldn't do the Improv and Mitzi found out, but I went to Scott. Dan said, dog. Richard Cooper gives me spots. So I would go over there and I had a couple of problems over there. Right off the bat. People thought they were cute over there. You know, you leave your fucking girlfriend and a seat. You go to bat and you come back and talking to them like they know that is an, it's a fucking issue.

Speaker 4:          01:09:00       And you gotta you gotTa stop. I'm like, I told you like Hitler in Munich or not, you're going to have a fucking problem dog. So I would say things to people and uh, all of a sudden you're a bad fucking person. So what the fuck? I don't give a fuck. And we're here 12 years later and we're still rocking and rolling. They could still suck my dick and call me shortly. We're doing a show. If you're in town, Pasadena, this Thursday night, I'm don't come if you're a stalker. Thanks Pasadena Ice House. Thursday night.

Speaker 4:          01:09:44       Not sure, not sure. No, I'm fucking. I'm just central drive and next time I go to La. I'm not driving this time. Next time I go to la though, I'm driving vegas. Vegas Memorial Day weekend to see, uh, to see junior dos Santos against my man. If he recovers the surgery. I'm tired of fucking flying man. I would rather just take the big flood Cadillac escalades. Let's go out. I got a new one. I got one of these are going to be things with the music and the whole fucking thing. Hey Brian, come here. Help me. You can export these things. It's not exporting, right? But then they'll pull us over like snoop Dogg, those cocks up because every time they see snoop Dogg, if they smell you anywhere near them, we're going to jail. It's right here. What a shotgun. The fucking house. I retrieved the video. Denny Pluto posters here, fresh off his fucking 19 Wednesday, Sunday grants. Enough flights.

Speaker 3:          01:10:33       It was a epic day for 10. What was the gracie nationals at the gracie nationals. Was was an la this past Sunday. And Rose Gracie, the granddaughter of Heleo Gracie, the grandmaster Gracie Jujitsu. She decided to go old school with the gracie nationals. She's been running it for the last few years and she, you know, the whole point system that Jujitsu tournaments, um, uh, run by or just ridiculous. I mean it's just people are fighting for points and stalling and it's, it's ridiculous. And Roads Gracie decided to, you know, make her or the great or late great helio gracie proud and make an all just a submission only tournament. And these, these tournaments are becoming this format. It's becoming more and more popular. They do it in the Pacific north northwest at, at, at that sub league in Oregon and they run smoothly. People have been afraid of sub only tournaments because of time constraints and all that stuff.

Speaker 3:          01:11:36       But rose gracie made it work. She had the balls to go, no points, no advantages, 15 minutes a submission only if, if, if you go 15 minutes without a submission, both competitors are out of the tournament. So that's the ballsy as format there is out there. And, and now the gracie nationals is the most prestigious submission only tournament on the planet. And I think that's the future for Jujitsu cause you know, it was a lot more fun preparing for a submission only tournament. All we worked on was the fun stuff. The good stuff about Jujitsu that the finish, the closing the deal that we're working on, our squeeze for the Nogi Worlds. Um, we had to spend time working on stalling techniques because when you're playing a point game and it's like six minute matches, a guy will get a point or just a little advantage, which is even less than a point.

Speaker 3:          01:12:32       And once they're up an advantage, the hold and they won't do anything and people aren't used to wrestling with guys that are just holding, holding onto leads in class. You don't just hold onto a lead, there's no one's counting points in class. So you actually have to prepare for that yet specifically prepare for tournaments that are run by points and um, it's just so not fun. Preparing like stalling techniques and stalling live drills and prepare. What are the do just hold on. It doesn't do anything. It's ridiculous. So rose gracie decided to eliminate all of that and make the gracie nationals a submission only tournament. And um, she's also doing the Gracie worlds in July, July 15th in San Jose. You know, finally, you know, you're going to be able to get a world title in a submission only format, which is the greatest. I mean, it's so much.

Speaker 3:          01:13:26       It means so much more to win in a submission only tournament. Then by points you're a world champion and you won by an advantage world champion at those days. It does nothing for the development of your Jujitsu. It just gets you better at holding and installing out and running out the clock. It's just ridiculous. So mad. Huge props to Rose Gray and her husband, Hobie Vasquez, who put this tournament together and you know, I think this is the future. I think a submission only format is the only way to go. You know, we're taking bias refs completely out of the gate. The refs have nothing to do with the game. No, well there's no time limited in the final, but in the qualifying matches is a 15 minute time limit, which is plenty enough to have plenty of time. And if there is no submission in those 15 minutes, both guys are out.

Speaker 3:          01:14:22       So it's, it's amazing. We had sold are out. So if two guys are just like Marcello Garcia and jake shields stall each other out, they're both out. Whoa, that's crazy. But in the finals, no time that we had some epic matches. Epic matches, um, 10 planet San Francisco went 12 and one I wish I had about, you know, maybe how many affiliates you got now I got to over 30. I lose track. Isn't that crazy? You started out just doing it as something to do, you know, like, man, what should I do? Maybe I could teach now and then boom. Now you got like an empire, man. It was all an accident. It's weird in a weird. I thought I thought that that when we were working on the man show, we were going to parlay that into some trey parker. Matt Stone. Shit, you know,

Speaker 1:          01:15:05       it was all a dream. I used to read word up magazine, Salt, pepper, heavy d up in the limousine. The next thing we're gonna do is we're going to get a fucking comedy club. I decided while I was taking a shit today, high as fuck on the toilet bowl. That's the next move. The next move is a reality show about, about this fucking place, about doing, doing a podcast and doing a comedy club and have an all connected the way we do it, man, when we have this show, so Thursday night

Speaker 3:          01:15:32       we have podcasts going on at the same time as the comedy show and everybody just rotates in. It's the greatest fucking thing we've ever done. The greatest thing we've ever done. The perfect thing. You go on stage, man, you're. You're already flowing. Like when you had to go on stage right now.

Speaker 1:          01:15:47       Yeah. You'll be able to show the Lucy snore brush story. What is it? What's the name? Lucy Snowe Bush. If you have, you told that Lucy snore Bush story and then when of the stage right now you would be in private. That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever told. Greatest story of all time. People want Root Lucy Snore, Bush tee shirts all by broken aluise store machines room and eight or asked the middle of the night. They want that tee shirt. Oh my fucking God. I on here. And then we got Vegas Friday. Fucking night. Yeah, we will. We were in Chicago. Like I said, this was the biggest show we'd ever done and it was pretty crazy. I made a video how fucking crazy it was.

Speaker 7:          01:16:22       Really how big this place is. I don't know if you can tell. Look at the size of this place. Wow. How long did you do? An hour and 22 minutes.

Speaker 1:          01:16:50       We stayed outside and signed pictures for fucking hours, man. I had to pay those security. I had to pay like 2000 extra dollars in security because they had to keep them around because it's like union is like, you know, laws, you know, you have to have rules, you have to pay. People look at the play, the second one, the second video is ridiculous. We were, is when we were signing, and this is a, all this the line of people that were waiting to, uh, to, to take pictures with, with Joanne and Dunkin and, and, and, and sign posters. Mike Maxwell made a poster just for the event and a check this shit out. This is, hold on one. Say, okay. This is bonkers, man. This is when we were in the upstairs balcony area. This place is fucking huge. That Chicago theater at one point in time, it was a silent movie house.

Speaker 1:          01:17:39       It was built in 1921. Sinatra performed. They had several little estis father took the mother to the see Sinatra ladies seven. Holy Shit. When he was forgetting his lyrics and the wig was crooked shit. Motherfucking Sinatra Jack. It was still banging bitches too with a Sinatra died before Viagra kicked in the boat. He's in the midst of those grumpy old men. They couldn't get any pussy anymore. There was no reason to perform. You know, there was, it was all over. Even though it was Sinatra. You only got a hard on like once a month at the end he was still getting pussy with the wig, like a pimp dog.

Speaker 7:          01:18:15       Brian.

Speaker 1:          01:18:17       It's obviously something,

Speaker 7:          01:18:18       Brian with an iphone.

Speaker 1:          01:18:20       The way the iphone interpreted it. Can't you rotate that? No, not on the flight, but look how easy that is.

Speaker 7:          01:18:26       You know why it does that right yet? Because it's a piece of shit. No, no, no. Before you hit record, look at the icon. If it's tilted sideways, it's going to record it sideways. Look how nutty that is. That

Speaker 1:          01:18:37       is, man. That's just all the people waiting to get into or to get into line to take pictures and shit. That was a fun, fun time. Thank you. It was dirty. Freaked that pulled her tits out and I had everybody sign her tests. She had great tits. Don't don't put it down. Nice. Twenty four year old for a little fucking cheese and she was afraid. She got a little boy for that. Looked like fucking. What's the guy? You little bars. I just was ready to go. Yeah, it didn't. Somebody throw the guy under the bus who wasn't a Jane and James used to date. Is that. Is that Bruno Mars? And it stinks. That song. Yeah. Well, Bruno Mars and the other guy, right? Yeah. There's two guys who sings. Who's the other one? I can't remember. There's a the rapper guy and then the singer guy.

Speaker 1:          01:19:20       Which one is which? Great fucking tune. Whoever the hell it is. Did you hear about those English people that got arrested at the airport and. No, you didn't hear about this shit, dude. It's one of the weakest things I've ever heard ever about. The TSA is sad with this country has become these English people. They were coming over here for a vacation, so they joked around and they said, hey, we're going to go over to America and we're going to fucking destroy America. We're going to dig up Marilyn Monroe's body. I mean, it sounds like some shit that Joey Diaz would say if he was British. Right. We're going to come over here. We're gonna. Have a fucking party. This is what they wrote. I'm going to destroy America and dig up Marilyn Monroe. That's what they said on his twitter. They came over here to party. That's all TSA. Check them for shovels. These dumb fucks you wouldn't remember. We're going to do. Oh,

Speaker 2:          01:20:07       did they tweet this or something? So now they're looking at her twitter. Yeah, man, they tweeted, they're there 26 years old, man. They're they're kids. They went to party, man, Department of Homeland Security Way to go. You fuckheads these silly fucks. They're supposed to be protecting us. They pulled aside this cute punk rock. Look in British couple that look like sweethearts. You know? I mean it's just let mean. Look at this. This is what. This is what a dude wrote. Free this week for a quick gossip prep before I go and destroy America. That's the question. Like a joke. He's going here to have a fucking party. Like he's going to destroy America. Jesus cry. They checked the shovels. They sent them back home. Man. Not only that, they arrested them, lock them up with Mexican drug dealers that they also caught versus 12 fucking hours because they're immigrants. They throw them in with the other immigrant criminals.

Speaker 2:          01:21:04       They throw them in with Mexican drug dealers that they busted, so these guys were locked up with real hardcore criminals for 12 fucking hours and then they flew him back to Europe. Fuck them, soul. Unbelievable. It's unbelievable. I mean really, you can't have one rational person who looks at those two angles and it starts laughing. His. It was his what he writes also three weeks today. We're totally in La, pissing off people in Hollywood boulevard and digging up Marilyn Monroe. Haha. He's joking around, man. You really, this is our tax dollars going to work. This is 2012. You know w we're not talking about 1950 like we jumped into a time machine. All of a sudden they have twitter in 1950. What? They're going to destroy America now. I think it was just to set an example like we're going to fuck anybody up the plays around. I don't.

Speaker 2:          01:21:52       I think it's a bully and an abuse of power. That's what it is. I don't think in Sydney example at all. I think they knew these were kids and they could fuck with them if they want it to. I think they found someone to fuck with. They found someone to fuck with and then and then they did. You know, it's really, really sad. They came here and have fun. You fuckheads Jesus Christ, check them for fucking show. They're, they're, they're checking twitter for joke joke, things that you say job tweets about coming to America and getting fucked up. Like, do you really think that that's what a chair was? Would white hm this week? Free for a quick gossip before I go destroy America. Like, yeah, that's what you have to worry about. That's where our tax dollars are going. What do you think about anonymous? Listen man, somebody needs to stand up for this fucking the wacky world that we're living in man and would anonymous represents is the internet.

Speaker 2:          01:22:41       Well, the Internet represented most of the time is justice. You know, most of what they go after, most of what they do is the right thing. There's a lot of shit that goes on like this Dana white thing where they're hacking into his, his, uh, social security and putting it all online. That's Douchey Shit. I heard it was fake. I heard it wrong. No, it wasn't fake. They got the information that you don't understand. First of all, it is dad's named Dana white as well and they got a lot of. Lot of the information they got was his dad's including liens and you know, where his dad used to live and now some other guy got harassed because they, you know, because his information got put online. So this guy like Dina had to go to this guy's house and apologize to him, but the kid is apparently a 13 year old kid from Australia mean he doesn't represent anonymous.

Speaker 2:          01:23:24       He represents people on the Internet that don't like when people in the Internet challenged them. You know, like you say, you can't hack me. I dare you. They're going to hack, you know, they're going to fucking hack you. But that's not what. What I like about anonymous, what I like is that what it represents is people feel helpless. They feel helpless to this gigantic, oppressive power that is controlling the world and running things in a way that they don't like. And when these guys go after Department of Homeland Security, all these different websites, when these guys try to take things down, what they're doing is they're there, they're lashing out, and they're saying, hey, we can touch you, we can reach you, we can find your information. Like when they went after that guy that pepper sprayed, all those fucking kids in the face, those kids at uc Berkeley that were just sitting on their knees and they got all that guy's information.

Speaker 2:          01:24:06       They put that shit online that I liked, that I liked because that lets that guy know, hey, you can't do morally fucked up things because you're doing it under the, the, the, the, the blanket of your job, the umbrella of protection that you think has offered you by being a police officer. You're doing something reprehensible, man. You're spraying kids in the face with, with chemicals, you piece of shit for no reason. Yeah. And you got to feel that man got, feel that. And you know what man? I saw a video where the people were trying to justify like, listen, this is what happened. This is the full story. What you saw was edited, you know what they saw? They saw the kids just sitting there for a longer know. Yeah. They didn't move when they were told to move. That doesn't mean you get

Speaker 6:          01:24:41       the spray in the fucking face. I heard there were some shit in La. Was it oakland re the other day and the cops were arrested like a crazy amount of people, like 120 or 30 people, but they were tear gassing and there was like kids. They're like one. I don't think it's probably the best idea to be bringing your kids to things like this.

Speaker 2:          01:24:59       Assholes who are bringing their kids to these rallies because these things, things can break out in violence at any moment. Especially in Oakland. Oakland is kind of crazy man. Too Short. Yeah. Short dog. Yeah. Oakland is not to be fucked with. Right. Oakland's a tricky place. You be in just for the hub for that shit for the last 40 years. They have no. They play it every year. That's where they go up there. These people know how to react to it. The sick and tired of it too. You know, and it takes two to tango, but I love the idea of somebody checking somebody. I've always loved the idea. Listen man, I grew up in fucking death. Wish you know what? The cops can't be there for you all the fucking time. I love the idea of somebody blast on the motherfucker when you fucking do something wrong.

Speaker 2:          01:25:45       That's the best way. I love it. I'd love to. Net. I think at the Internet is eventually going to be the government. That's what I think. I think the way that we're going to govern things just through the Internet because instead of these oppressive groups that see what what really fucks us is that we don't really get a say in everything. Well, we get to do is we get a representative. We get to choose a representative and they almost all get into office and immediately just do whatever the fuck incorporations that got them into power, asked them to do. That's what they do immediately. They pass a bunch of bills like the national defense authorization act that everybody's going crazy about that. Obama passed that. He said he would veto all of that stuff is stopped. If you put that for vote to America, like at on the online, what do you want?

Speaker 2:          01:26:25       What do you guys want to do? No fucking way. We would vote for that. Were you going to arrest us and detain us with no warrant? Because what people have to realize is the people that you're saying yes to today, when you make a law and you say, okay, here's the law. These people today may not be the same people. You're saying yes to 20 years from now or even 10 years from now. You can put laws into place that give evil, corrupt people. I'm not saying Obama Zebulon corrupt, but I'm saying what he did is an evil and corrupt thing and he opened the door for evil and corruption. No doubt about it because if someone wants to do that, some future Douchebag, some Dick Cheney of the future. If he gets into a position and in the national defense authorization act is in place, guess what?

Speaker 2:          01:27:04       A bunch of people going to go to fucking jail that are just protesting. The government have got a bunch of people going to go to jail for obstructing the. The way the United States runs, they're going to go to jail as enemies of the state. That's real shit, you know, and that none of that would take place if the Internet was how we did our government and it sounds ridiculous, but why shouldn't it be that way? What what our government is supposed to represent is what the people want and what the people want can easily be found out on the Internet. It's easiest, the easiest way to contact people and find out exactly what the fuck they want regardless of nationality, regardless of the state. Where they live in is the internet. That is how things are going to be ruled. It used to be you had to go to a place, you had to write down what you thought and put it in a fucking box and that's how they decided things.

Speaker 2:          01:27:45       You only because that was the only way to do it. Any problem with that though is there's more opportunity for hacking and things like that. Unfortunately. Now, right now there is. Yeah. But you know what, that can be worked out too. And you know what, that's also in part, a lot of that is in place because also because of corruption. Look at the fucking. The computerized voting machines. Yeah. If you don't know about this, watch a documentary called hacking democracy. It was something that was on Hbo Awhile back where they showed that these machines, these diebold machines are designed to be altered. They're designed so that a third party can come in and change the results and they were so fucked up. They changed their name. Diebold isn't even diebold anymore. I'll find out what the fuck her name, ours now so he can't be tricked, but we live in a corrupt system and the what the Internet recognizes is that the will of the people is not being represented what's being represented as the corporations and that's why everybody's hovering around all these fucking, these, these bill w, w with this occupy thing is everyone's hovering and collecting and gathering together around all these sick areas.

Speaker 2:          01:28:51       Yes. Yeah man. We, we had to short on a podcast last night and it was really amazed at the rapper, the rapper, he has like 19 albums out, but of the cool things

Speaker 6:          01:29:02       hearing him talk about was a big. He started off so early in the game that people didn't even know what rap was. And like he would just like open up his car doors to and they have like a beat playing and just rap, you know, like really loud with it. And like one guy came up to him, he's like, man, I like it, I want to have that. And then he just popped the cassette and sold it to him for five bucks and then he started selling it to like, all the drug dealers want heard about it. And they're like, that lived in Oakland, like all the king pin guys. And so they all wanted their own personalized wrap, a cassette. So then he was like making, like having to write all these songs like nonstop just to keep up with all these drug. How'd you the guy who knows him?

Speaker 6:          01:29:40       Uh, we had Kevin Black on who's a sex tape guy who I, you know, he's the one that gets all the sex tape, like the Paris Hilton sex tapes and stuff like that. He's one of the only guys that has even seen the tupacs a sex tape. Uh, and uh, he's friends with them. He's friends with them with your short shorts. So what's up with that? Tupac sex to a white girls or African Americans? I don't know. I didn't. I said, why can't you release it? Two Bucks. Family? Yeah, I think it was a family thing. I think. I think the people

Speaker 1:          01:30:11       powers of be diebold changed his name to premier election solutions incorporated or p e s I, that's the new diebold. Isn't it funny when companies do that, they get caught doing something fucked up. So they just changed the name and they just were evil, but whatever. You got to blackwater did the same thing. They changed. The man was. I'll find out. How far do you,

Speaker 6:          01:30:31       I think anonymous can go. Do you think that could ever get shut down? Can they know it's impossible? The idea. Because I think a lot of people get confused what in anonymous is the whole point why they can't get shut down because no one knows who the fuck they are. There's tons of figure it out. There's tons of people though, will. If they started arresting people, it would be the most impossible thing that'd be like trying to have an army put together that attacks the whole world. It would be like world war for real world.

Speaker 1:          01:30:55       This is crazy. Blackwater. So fucked up. They change their name twice. They changed. They went from blackwater to x e and then they went from x e to academic with a new logo. They just changed their name. They figured this. No one's going to know. Just keep changing it, keep changing it.

Speaker 6:          01:31:13       Stopping anonymous would be like, yeah, they could spend all this money and time and they'll find some 13 year old in Australia and then there's like a million.

Speaker 1:          01:31:20       Well, the thing is that guy, you know, what, what can they do to, to, um, to prosecute people that the catch and how far they can go as far as shutting things down and controlling the infrastructure. That's what people worried about what this Sofa with this sofa, what they're worried about. Again, it's not the people you're saying yes to today. They might not be the same people you're saying yesterday, 20 years from now and if you give the government the ability to just shut down websites, which by the way they already do. They just did with Mega upload. Yeah. No, they just closed down mega upload. I'm so, I'm so bummed about mega upload, closing to a good website. Okay. But let's play devil's advocate. They close mega upload because they said that Mega upload has a bunch of different illegal files on it, like where's, and they have a of like movies and shit that screeners and mp3s if there's a website should. And if you're offering that service to people where they can just upload shit and then you sell advertisement, which they do, right? Isn't that how they work that shit? And they sell subscriber.

Speaker 6:          01:32:12       I think if you have a free account, there's limitations and they serve advertising. I think they also have a paid account that I don't think has advertising, but I think what it is is that it shouldn't be the company's fault. It should be the user. So yes, they find dances with wolves on Mega Upload Server. They find out who uploaded a day bust him. I don't think it should be mega uploads fault for having a service where you can legally you're supposed to share file, but let's play devil's advocate.

Speaker 1:          01:32:38       Let's play devil's advocate. If you do have a service where you're just sharing files and providing bandwidth, you should be responsible for how much of that stuff is pirated because otherwise you're a distribution angle. You're. You're essentially a distribution highway for illegal shit.

Speaker 6:          01:32:53       I think maybe yes you should be, but I think it should be more of like, I don't know, sharing of a personal information. If you are doing something illegal should be allowed. Maybe hearing a personal meaning like if, if, if, if the FBI comes to mega app logos, look, we know that you have dances with wolves on your server and they're like, okay, we need to know who this user rising. I think then mega upload should be like, okay, here's the person's there for really using this should give you up. If you're doing illegal stuff. I don't think it should be mega uploads fault. I don't think mega upload as a corporation should be shut down and for a business because you want to share dances with wolves. Well you know

Speaker 1:          01:33:29       better the corporation be shut down in the user's going to jail. That's the other devil's advocate is that these are just kids and they don't know any better and they think they're going to get away with it and they think they're just helping people out by providing files that everybody wants to get ahold of. You know, look, the pro, the real problem is people have kind of grown up knowing that they can get shit for free now. You know, that's like sort of how they're. That's how people feel. They feel like shit is free, you know, hey, I can get movies for free. They joke around about it. I've had people joke around on my own website about stealing my shit online. They think it's cute, you know? Yeah, I'll get the torrent, lol, you know, and you're like, wow, you know, like right in front of you knowing that you, it's just, it is what it is. That's who you want to be. That's, that's all good. But it's like they're so accustomed to stealing that they talk about it openly in front of the person's face, on the website of the person who's selling the shit.

Speaker 6:          01:34:17       Yeah. But that's just ignorance and stupidity. But yeah. So they, they feel obligated, not obligated. They feel like they're entitled, you know what it should be. It shouldn't be throwing people in prison. I don't think it should be like, yeah, you, you were sharing dances with wolves with seven other people and I don't think that person should go to prison for 20 years. I think you should have some kind of thing like maybe. Right. You're not allowed to have the Internet for a year. You know, Kevin Mitnick

Speaker 1:          01:34:42       punishment, that's what they did to him, but the real issue, Brian, is that, that actually has crushed industries. You look at the music industry, the music industry is fucked. You know what, you know, one of the things that Dana White didn't wait actually wants to come on the podcast and he wants to talk about. So, but um, let's talk about all the shit that happened, you know, I talked about interviewing on my own. Let me interview for UFC. It got DOTCOM. He goes, you know what? It'd be better. Let's do your podcast. I said, all right, we'll do it. So we're going to figure out when to do it. And so he's, he's totally into free speech. You just don't want him any ripping off his fucking product. And then, you know, the, the, the amount of piracy is so widespread that people were actually pirating streams and then showing them in bars and charging people to go to those bars to watch pirated streams.

Speaker 1:          01:35:23       There's definitely cases like that day, obviously that's, that should be attacked. Well, there's also people that put streams up and then they sell advertising. They have Google ads and they actually, you know, it's not just like a free thing, they're making money off of the stream. Right. You know, that's, that's a big, there's a big difference between that. That person is putting that up there and making money for people. Thousands of people that are coming to the site and the person who's 14 years old can't afford the UFC, who's downloading it for free. Yeah. So that's what the real issue is. What they're really. What they're really concerned about is the people that are actually profiting off pirating their shit, you know? And so it's, it's a tricky thing. Like my take on it has always been that the Internet without a doubt has promoted me and helped me more than anything.

Speaker 1:          01:36:06       So the more people that have stolen my stuff means the more people who have enjoyed my stuff, which means the more people will come to see me, the more people will come. Like this Chicago show or anything else, you know, I mean that's the purpose. We could easily charge for this podcast. I mean, some of you probably willing to pay, but we know a lot of people that make a lot of money every month because of their podcasts, you know, they have subscriptions where they have like one extra podcast they do every month, but I think the best way to do it is to give as much people as much shit for free as possible. But that's also because we're live performers, you know, that's how we see it. You know, we're, we're live performances, like the key to for us as you know, come out and see us, man,

Speaker 6:          01:36:41       devil's advocate on the devil's advocate of the UFC UFC thing is that honestly there's 60 bucks and nowadays there's like two or three UFC. He's a month sometimes. Even to me, I liked the UFC to a bit like I, I know if I was a hardcore UFC guy, I'd order everything.

Speaker 1:          01:37:01       It's a lot of money. I know that's a lot on. It's like, man, I don't argue with

Speaker 6:          01:37:03       that's $180. I think sometimes it's every week. I think that if UFC was smart and a lot of these people were smart, they would do a subscription based thing like you're paying 20 bucks a month, you get everything use,

Speaker 1:          01:37:13       you know, what else would be kind of dope if they had it laid the way Hbo pay per view has it where you are if you like, don't want to watch Oscar de la Hoya fight or floyd mayweather fight and hbo pay per view next week. The next Friday. It's for free on HBO. Yeah, that's good. That would be pretty, pretty dope. I agree with, you know, if like they had like huge cards, like say Alistair Overeem, fight junior dos Santos and it's a big paper of card. How I'll throw it on Fox the next Friday, you know, you could watch a replay and that way also they'll know that they're going to put on some bad ass fight. So if it's some, you know, if it's one of those fights, it's not the most entertaining fight. I mean I live fights are much better shore for Fox. Maybe it's not fox, maybe it's an fx thing, showed on fx the week after.

Speaker 4:          01:37:56       Not a bad idea, but the thing about MMA is a lot of people by the replays, they'll buy it again and they'll bite level. They're here about how good it is. And they'll buy the replay. That probably kills a venue thing about two weeks. WHATSAPP, that kills it about two weeks. So you've got to get all the money you can, you know, what he was doing over the years is after a fight, um, they would put it up to use a leash, maybe six months. Now they fucking put it up at UFC at least a month later. Yeah. That's good. That's really fucking good. Good. Uh, the fight, uh, not this week, but let's say a Vic Diaz against Nate Diaz against the serone, you know, I want to see that, you know, beyond this month. That was new years. So it'll be on first week of February. I miss all those spike guys. Those guys were awesome. Well, you know, like I said, right now is the best time. Listen, right now is the best time ever for another band. Susie's. Yeah, like me. Look, I go home right now. I tape UFC tonight. I tape fucking pride with Kendra Perez from nine to 10, which is better than the, the pride they were doing before. They eliminated a lot of shit that you didn't need to see. And now they even cut it down. They got cro, cop against fucking, uh, the Russian. I've been watching this tension that my Alexander.

Speaker 4:          01:39:11       Oh, that my head is almost exploded. Not to mention, you know, you've got the round table with Jay. You got, you know, late night fucking, uh, uh, were UFC reloaded, which those are fucking lightning quick. Okay. So let's see. The Ben Henderson fight against Frankie Edgar is the 25th. It'll beyond by the last week of March. Plus you got fucking, they got the contract, not spiteful together. Two thousand 12. So on Wednesdays you could watch fucking old fights all fucking day and you know, spike anything that fucking fx does. Now they counter it with like this week they had all of her shots, fights. Believe it or not, a couple of people fucking watch that shit. I think it's good. This is good. I'm happy. I don't miss anything. My dvr is UFC. We loaded UFC tonight. Tonight is to count down at 6:00. Fucking Pacific, 9:00 eastern. They've given you a ton of fucking May. You got to fucking steal something for what the fuck you going to feel something for that. What else can they fucking give you

Speaker 3:          01:40:07       on the music tip? What I've found for me personally, like with itunes and Torrance is not good as people. I mean the whole industry, the record industry just fell apart. But what's happening and I know they got to feel this, but I'm buying all my old shit on itunes. I don't want to pull out the CD's and load them into my computer and then upload them to my ipod. I just want to get on my phone and I think of a song that I already have from my old record collection. I'm bree buying all my old shit. What about that? You know, I know, you know, we're not buying as many cds, but I think people are buying all the old shit stairway to heaven about 30 times in my life. Yeah, there's definitely a few cds of 10 times. I don't want to. I know you can get it for free somewhere. I know people

Speaker 4:          01:40:54       just like, let me go to itunes. Ninety nine cents, make it so you have money, you know, for really poor college kids. They do exactly that, but they go to a website or they go to a torrent bit. Does or even where sites anymore. Not really leaving an itunes yet. They finally fucking. Who are they? There's a couple of bands that still to this day they will be. It's just got on it recently. Pink Floyd. A couple of bands. Well, why I don't understand. I don't know. Weird. You know those motherfuckers I set 1970, so I just like, like red band said when it's something that you can download illegally, like music or movies or anything, it just sell it for as cheap as possible so that you got to sell it so that it's not worth going. And what he did with Lucy gets. So this whole special for five bucks, you'll get that money.

Speaker 6:          01:41:46       I will never spend $180 on a UFC, you know, a month. But if I were to the option for 20 bucks a month, I got everything. I would do it even if I never watched a books militia. Louis C dot K dot. Well yeah, but you're just used to. People get a lot more people. You're just so used to our pricing structure that was created by boxing and in like the eighties because the paper view is so amazing. Right?

Speaker 4:          01:42:10       What if you had any idea how much it costs to put on a production, you would understand why you didn't have to charge so much. It's ridiculous, but if you have 20 bucks no more. No you wouldn't. You wouldn't sell enough to compensate? I don't think so. Well, Louis CK did. Joe Rogan was with the most brilliant thing and can be done in 20 years. Yeah, he. He's like anonymous. He checked. Everybody checked. The whole central got checked. I told got checked. By the way, I'm doing the same thing I'm working on right now. I'm thinking about doing an Atlanta in April. That's what it gave it away for free or something for a DVD. But here's the beauty of it, man. Dope. Everybody benefited on this, but nobody benefited as much as the fans. Louis did it for his fame. Five bucks. I found load. Is that what it was for the actual hard copy download? Well, that's all you need. That's all you leave. That's it. I guess. I think it can download, downloaded more than once. Take it so cheap that they can't really make out. It was the. It was a million dollars.

Speaker 6:          01:43:06       The idea of the UFC. Twenty bucks a month then. Yeah. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:43:08       yeah. I don't think they would do it that way. It's not ready for $20 a month or two years. Three years away. The subscription monthly subscription is not a bad idea, you know, that would be pretty cool. Sure. You get everything. You get the webpage you get there. What is the club? What's in fight club? Fight Club. I don't have like a thing that they do that with the NFL. They have nfl packages that you get on direct TV, all the Games but games, they make a ton of fucking money. Well you know, we came, they came real close to having a UFC channel, you know they were going to have a UFC fucking channel at one point in time. They were thinking about buying like a spike tv or something along those lines and start their own channel and that might very well be the future, you know, who knows after they're done with the Fox deal or they might do it with Fox or you know, who knows how all this comes together. You know the

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       Fox things are strange man. It's a, it's the same but it's not the same. It's the same. But there's like all this extra talking, you know, I see all this sitting around the desk and all this shit and I watched it. I was like, I feel like, you know, the way we did it spike style, they could slide in another fight. You know, there's some bad ass fights and that undercard man, you know, they could have in

Speaker 4:          01:44:10       Charles wants to cut out. Yeah, totally shit that we could have slid in there,

Speaker 1:          01:44:16       could have slid something in there instead of everybody talking. I would rather not talk other than, you know what I mean? Look, everybody knows what it is. I'll, I'll, I'll hype it up in the beginning and everything like that. But I want to get that fucking walking going. Let's go baby. Let's go. You know, I, I can hype everything up plenty. While these dudes are walking into the octagon, I can answer any questions or propose any possible scenarios. I just want the fucking fight to take place. I say the less talking the better. But I think they're used to like desks and shit. Fox used to like dudes with paper in front of him.

Speaker 4:          01:44:41       They love the whole fucking crazy listening to a superbowl music with UFC mad. That's not super well music. That's Fox sports music. Well that's the music you hear. They get all crazy. By the way, God is your specialist. $5. We should mention that. The first card gets me in the priest, right? Yes. It's either you or the priest. The first cargo payloads. Payloads. But hopefully that I like to UFC Brian. I like what they do as a fan. I like what they do. I really like everything about it. You know, when I watched the short time, I got a load of fucking volume. Okay. And when I watch Fox, I don't mind Kenny Florian there, the other guys like a miniature fucking Joe Rogan with his little haircut and his little fucking suit. He looks like Joe Rogan. Who's radio? Yeah, he was like Joe Rogan on news radio. He needs a pointy sideburns.

Speaker 4:          01:45:34       Right. So. Well it's so weird that. What the fuck was I talking about? Anyway? Who knows? They got the first fight was a fucking nightmare. We went to it. You go kind enough to give myself any tickets. First off, the fight started at six. Nothing happened till 6:40. That's too much. Joe Rogan. I can't sit there for 40 minutes just talking. Everybody else was taught at least now they giving you three minutes. We sat there. No national anthem though. Peanut. Nobody get daddy and give you a fucking drink. We didn't know what to do. You can't get up you campaign. We don't know what the fucking next file. Yeah, they didn't treat it the way we always try to live have been tremendous. This last one was beautiful. I watched. I taped the Fox thing that the main fight,

Speaker 1:          01:46:18       except for the bisping Simon fight, which is pretty exciting. The main fight weren't as exciting as the fights and the undercard. You know

Speaker 4:          01:46:25       bro, it's the curse of Fox. The cursor. No, it'll be fine. Look at fx fight that Melvin Gallard. Jim Miller. Jim Miller is a fucking animal dude. Jim Miller's an animal. God Damn that dude. Melvin was lightening. Bob. He was shot. She can take it to him. Man. He could take it in the way he took that back, dove on that back mountain. Man. I've always been scary from low side of those guys from that side of the woods in Jersey. They come up to creedence clearwater and shit like that. Close to Pennsylvania. Those motherfuckers will kill you. That, that, that other side of New Jersey. That's what I love. See you guys will be living in Georgia. People over there. Yeah. That's fucking different. Wherever the fuck he's from. Yeah. That's. That's a different angle. Yeah. Jim Miller is a hunter. You know, you don't think of that when you think of Jersey like outdoors. You got the Jersey shore, you've got those crazy fucking mountain men. Had you got to northern New Jersey. That's it. Do you want me to build? Yeah, totally different. Three different fucking confidence in what the Jersey shore. Just it just passing off. Ed just.

Speaker 3:          01:47:35       I started watching Jersey shore and I thought, can't love him and Dina. Oh my God. You love it. For Real. I'm addicted to it because they're so retarded. I love watching. I mean, snuggie and Dina are female versions of Beavis and butthead and they're, they're like, for real, they're actually alive if it's not animation. These are real people.

Speaker 6:          01:48:05       No, Eddie, there's their, their, their setup fits fake reality.

Speaker 3:          01:48:09       It's sometime or whatever it is.

Speaker 4:          01:48:13       Hold on though. Did you see sneaky get punched? That shit was not fake. It's.

Speaker 6:          01:48:16       That was. That was one or season two, but yeah, but the majority of the shit now is like, hey, we're going to put snookie inside this barbershop, barber, barbershops, super gay because we cast him gay, you know, and it's just gonna be ridiculous. It's completely fake. And you know what's even worse about the whole fucking Jersey shore thing is that new movie, a three stooges. How might. This is a classic franchise that's been rebooted in the trailer. Fucking snookie's in it and it's just like this, this derby.

Speaker 3:          01:48:43       I love her. I just want her to talk. Her and Dina Dina's, her best friend. She's amazing. It's incredible. All they do, every episode is going to be a part in the episode where they're all getting ready to go out and they're all doing their fucking hair and putting on their makeup. They go to Karma and it's the same shit. You know that's crazy about it is those, they are so retarded that you would think with all the cameras, with all the cameras and all their fame, that they would have girls crawling all over them. Girls would you would you would think none of the girl. You would think that guys would have girls crawling all over them, but it's not what you think. It's like girls don't want to go back to that house and be on TV. Fuck yeah. Not only are going to get fucking loser credible. They go out and they go out and sometimes they don't get pussy. They got cameras all over them and they're super famous and they have fucking bad nights and the girls are banging or like regular fucking skis

Speaker 4:          01:49:48       is that they've been banging for a long time that they're incredible. It's like a big edge though. That's as good as Jersey shore is as good as Jersey shore is the best show on TV. Nothing flux with mob wives do. If you haven't watched mom lives, go fuck yourself. That is the watch that you watch. Watch, watch, watch. You know. The problem is I knew too many of those women, those women that I knew, guys that were like in and they would like fucking threatened you. I'll fucking make one phone call right now. These bitches are just fighting every episode they want and they have money. They're in their forties. You would think they would have some class the last few years on their twitters. Oh yeah, I do. I follow all of wife. The one is divorced and she keeps calling her ex husband. This man disrespected me one with the big head.

Speaker 4:          01:50:42       Oh wait a minute. Ralphie May. Is her husband out of jail are in jail. Her husband divorced her. I don't know. You think he was about to go to jail again? The doll? Yeah. Yeah. That's. That's a skill it to Reagan. He's Puerto Rican. He's Puerto Rican. He's Puerto Rican. Her father, they're saying that she married, she married or he married a to get into the model. That's what they're saying. They're accusing. Her name is Hector Judea. Really? How many fucking Italians you know, name is hector. He's cute, but what happened was, remember we had this discussion the other day. I read her sweater. Staten Island was a fucking garbage dump. Brooke, by the fucking Indians, just really put the Indians. They throw him out of New York. Then they decided, fuck, we got this property over there. Let's build on fucking staten island with garbage. Got Hill. So it was all just garbage.

Speaker 4:          01:51:30       It used to half of it was a dump. That's why when you're driving Bro, it's 20 minutes from Jersey. That way that's when they give you. Tell you what Staten Island to me wasn't doing all. Like when I used to do gigs in New York, Staten Island had the most unfriendly environment. There was one club. I'm standing on GRANDPA's. That was. They wouldn't give you a seat for your girlfriend. You would show up with your girlfriend. They would like to sit down in the back. No. You see two for customers like wow, like your performance, like they don't even have like a little site, little spot where the performer can sit down and your girlfriend can sit down. Like they would want you to, you know, go stand outside. Stupid. You're not a part of the show. I went to. Let's just a weird vibe. Let's start with the one time because I got sick and tired to go to Harlem.

Speaker 4:          01:52:14       If they caught you weeded Harlem on the way back from Jersey would confiscate your car because you were interested in transporting over federal lines. Those bridges in that tunnel? Yeah. That cute. But if they catch you bringing drugs over, your car gets confiscated. It is in California, so that's what happened there. So they would wave. So you had to go in through the George Washington and come back to the Lincoln tunnel after everyday you get sick of gold over there for weed. They said the Jamaicans had gun to Staten Island. Okay. There's a Jamaican able to stand down when they sold the best. So one day 94 being my buddy go over there. No biggie. We drive in Papa, Papa, Papa will, looking for black people. We can't fucking find. We can find. I can't smell though fucking incense. I can't do nothing. Right. And all of a sudden what do I see?

Speaker 4:          01:52:58       I see 20 fucking Guido's on a quarter with white tee shirts on with white shoes on Pinky rings the whole day I pull up, you know, at the light. They're like, what are you who you are looking for? Not that we're looking for a little bit. Pull over, pull over. Come on. Over and before, you know, have 20th Italians around. Yeah. What are you looking for? I want a 20. Alright. Park the fucking car and go into the fucking pizza places. Somebody will come up that I parked the car and my buddy. You know what? I'm hungry. I go to the pizza place. Guy Comes in. What do you want? I want a 20. Okay, listen from now on, when you come over here, you see fucking whatever his name was. Angelo [inaudible] us for Angela. No problem. Okay. One day it snows a month later. You know what?

Speaker 4:          01:53:37       I don't want to go into this city. Let's go on to Staten Island real quick. The weed wasn't bad. I pull up. I don't see Angelo. I don't see nobody. Actually. 20 fucking gillies. I don't know. None of them. I pull over. I go into a pizza place within 15 minutes. I had 15 Italians in there. Three of them were bats. We don't hear disrespected. We polled you when you come up here. You got to see Angelo. You want asking for Louis? I didn't ask her. Nobody asks for fucking slice of Pizza. It was an hour and a half drama. They get a $20 bag of weed. Where's the wind? You know what we did? I don't know what a witness. What a witness and I was like, you don't want. It was too much for me Bro. It was too much for me. It was just one island vibes and bad vibes.

Speaker 4:          01:54:16       The pizza was delicious. The bread was delicious to everything was great, but I never went back over there and that's what I see when I watched my spots like was not comfortable for you. That's the first. Last year, and this is why once he a good father, good father Ted, who you with, that's the person they asked you. Not with nobody I came with. No, no, no, no. Eddie Bravo. Who by the way reinforced by all those shitty mom movies. You know. So many people got a bronx tale and all these different. Bronxdale wasn't that bad, but I got the greatest movie of all time. They were all great movies. There's a great bunch of them. Father too, and I forgot to tell you some. It's better than the fucking the first movie ever. That's better than the first one. Not to me because Marlon Brando is rock over fucking everything.

Speaker 4:          01:55:03       You know what I'm saying? It was rocket when he told us that motherfucker at the table that, you know what? I do have all this situation here. My son has to come back, but if for some of fortunate fucking situation, he should be struck by a bolt of lightning or he should be handled at his fucking jail cell. I will blame the people at this table and that I will not fucking forgive. That's the greatest speech at the top of the arm. The data, stupid. He didn't know he douchebag wants to be that guy. Marlin Brando was beautiful. The fucking studio book. After he did that, listen, Marlon Brando than ever. The Marlon Brando was one of my idols because he told Hollywood to suck his dick. He went down to a lot of men suck his dick. I have a photo of it. If you put on the bounty, he went down to mutiny on the bounty and bought a fucking island.

Speaker 4:          01:55:51       Nobody's ever bought an island. Nobody's ever been that fucking quit. Tyler Perry after. Now. This was 1970. It was motherfucker and then impregnated half the women on that island. All of them are named Marlin. Every fucking killing. It was Marlon Brando. That was part of living on the island. You got to suck. There was this island off the coast of Hawaii or say wherever you shot, what that thing. I went to Dr Moreau. Warner brothers went down there and wherever the fucking people what it looked at the tapes and you're like, what is this birds and pigeons where you been? Where the fuck you been for the last month? He, he's like, God, that'd be fucking these Hawaiian chicks up the ass a great fucking time. So, um, when the godfather came along, they didn't want them. They're like, this guy wasted millions of fucking dollars. Yeah. Put that up here.

Speaker 4:          01:56:31       Put that up here. Brian. Put that up. Put that up. Look at this. Oh, you can't do it on Ustream, right? But if you just Google Marlin Brando Sucking Dick, it's actually an artistic shot that really stopped the car. That's how big the motherfucker. And he doesn't even look that fat back then. Kills the fucking. Listen, I got to Boogie with Stu. I love you. I'll see you Thursday night. I got to. I need six up under the Bob Hope. Fucking senator to get everything in shape. Don't forget payloads. Don't forget fucking kill you. Motherfucker. Pay Load. Bravo. Don't forget the Sandy Bravo a gift for his fucking kid on twitter. Send it to. Oh, some guy emailed me. They bought you a camera cock sucker. So I want them points Thursday and Friday night we're going to have a good time. House of Blues, Vegas, Mandalay Bay, Duncan Trussell, Joe Diaz need

Speaker 2:          01:57:25       the whole pile. And one more thing I wanted to talk about before we get out of here because this is pretty fucking fascinating shit. You know, we talked about that, uh, the problem in the ocean that big a pile of a plastic that they have the garbage patch, they just found them a mushroom and the Amazon that eats indestructible plastics. Wow. Yeah. It's pretty fucking nuts man.

Speaker 4:          01:57:45       So we're gonna throw a bunch of mushrooms on it and then the water's going to be all trippy and we're all gonna. Die Eats

Speaker 2:          01:57:51       polyurethane man. The mushroom is called pedal lot too. Sis. Pedal up top assists. Photo micro spora a o pestilence, pestilence, t opsis, Pesta Lottie opsis Mike grow spora. Why do they ask the name of the stuff with the Latin? Let it go, bitch. It's 2012, you know, awesome. Plastic eating mushrooms, that's the official name. It's spelled p e s t a l o t I o p s I s micro s p o r a. So it's a resident of the Ecuadorian rainforest and was discovered by a group of student researchers led by molecular biochemistry professor Scott Strobel as a part of Yale's annual rainforest expedition and laboratory. You know, they go down there, man, they have these scientists and these researchers go down there and every now and then they'll find some fucking crazy shit that there's like all sorts of medicines that have come out of the rain forest, incredible psychedelic drugs, all kinds of nutty fucking things in that shoe, in that bitch up every day.

Speaker 2:          01:58:59       So the mushroom like disintegrates the, the plastics or what's the, do it, eats it, it's able to the fungus species will it absorb, you know, mushrooms absorb things. They, they, you know, it's really like they're, they're the, the, it's Karma. It's like Karma free living the way mushrooms live their speech. They literally live in Shit. You know, they lived the most humble life possible, but there it's a living organism. It's the first fungus species to able to, to be able to survive exclusively on polyurethane. So it lives on fucking indestructible plastic. And more importantly, it's able to do that in anaerobic conditions, meaning the same conditions found in the bottom of landfills. And this makes this fungus a prime candidate for bio read remediation, remediation, bio remediation projects that could finally provide an alternative to just burning plastic and hoping for the best. I wonder how long that process takes.

Speaker 2:          01:59:53       Like are we talking about like 30 years, million years? But at least it's better than what the plans now. Now they need to find some shit that a nuclear waste. It's probably in the Amazon. It's probably a frog. Probably snookie. It's a frog. They're going to give it this frog. It's gonna eat nuclear waste. And that's going to become fucking Godzilla. Oh No. There goes Tokyo. Go, go Godzilla. Danny proper goes to want to step up to the mic and to be on the podcast here. Sign is our boy danny. We've known Danny since he was a little child since he was a small boy. And now he's a black belt world champion. First Tenth Planet Jujitsu, black belts. The viewers have been looking at his feet for the last two hours. That phones headphones. Okay, so everybody knows that you know what you sound like much, but at the gracie nationals this past Sunday, not only did 10th planet get the first place, team title, the Gracie nationals, but Danny also got got first place in his division tapping out to black belts.

Speaker 2:          02:00:49       He twisted a Joe Merera black belt and he guillotine UFC star Damn Fan. Denny Denny had a. He kept off of an epic day for 10th Planet and there was a flying d isn't going flying one jumped up. No, no, no, no. He shot in for a single leg on my right leg. And uh, I just wrapped his neck and I drove my hips and he fell back. I hooked his right leg with a triangle, stepped over with my right leg, crossed my feet, arched my hips, looked up. It was amazing, man. It was just getting nasty. We know Denison's what we, what were you like a purple belt when you started training with that? A blue belt. Blue, blue, blue. But I started, actually, no, I started training with Eddie when I was an orange belt. Uh, but. So that's like little kids. Yeah, I was 15. Let me go

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       tell them about our first private lesson. He lives in San Francisco. He's been there the whole time. I'm in La. I had just opened up. I had my first school open for maybe two years and uh, I'll never forget, I'll never forget when it was after our tournament. Me and a couple of well known Jujitsu players were in the parking lot, smoking some weed in our car and here's this little kid, like two cars away, just standing there looking at us and we're like trying to hide the, we'd like to know there's a kid that hide the weed. We're like hiding the weed and he knew exactly what we're doing. Like Ah. And then we came up in San Francisco. Yes. Yeah, he drove down for the kids. Learn about weed when they're three. Dude, it's been legal there for like 30 years. Nobody gives a fuck.

Speaker 3:          02:02:24       I got it. The first time I got offered a smoke was, I was in fourth grade. There was this. Tell us about, tell us about your first experience with, um, like remember your birthday and all that kind of stuff. Oh yeah. Uh, so for my 15th birthday, uh, my brother and I were going to go down to the scree convention. It was like this Greek dancing thing and I'm like, all right, I want to, I want to take a private with Eddie, you know. And uh, he taught me the rubber guard back then. He actually taught me London and taught me the invisible color, the basic path and uh, taught me some twister stuff, taught me the meat hook and I basically went back and all the stuff, I've videotaped it. He is, he had his brother drive down from San Francisco, so it was pretty cool.

Speaker 3:          02:03:12       So that's pretty crazy. I had this kid and I usually don't do privates, but this kid shows up and I'm like, you know what I have, I like to save all my energy for my group classes. I really don't have energy for privates. Really just rarely do I give them and he comes down, you know, there's 15 year old kid drove all the way from Frisco. I'm like, okay. And he ended up. I knew right there, right. I knew that this guy, there was something special about them. I knew that. I mean, if he's willing to drive all the way down from San Francisco to take a private, that he's down for life. This guy was. Yeah, that's most of the most important thing that anybody could ever show. It was just, if you want to be successful at something, you have to be really fucking dedicated to it.

Speaker 3:          02:03:53       Really dedicated and doing something like that come all the way down from San Francisco. That shows him. It never waver because even to this day, to this day, I'm not just saying this to this day, he's, he's definitely the most decorated 10th planet. Yeah. He's, he's, he's one of the most titles. He's competed the most at the highest levels. Um, in straight grappling. I have guys that have done mma and they've done well like Scott Epstein at all, but it pure grappling denny has done the most and it's because he. He drills and practices way more than anybody I know. I mean he's a Jujitsu fanatic. Not only does like yesterday. We're rolling. We're rolling and every move, every little trick I had, even the latest shit, the latest tricks, he would call it out. He would tell me what I was thinking. Nobody can do that. Nobody can break down the 10th planet system like Danny, tell me exactly how I'm planning to trick them. I've never had anybody do that. He was calling everything out. It was fucking me up like, Holy Shit, this guy's reading my mind. He studies the template system like no one else and he studies the. All the new games that are coming up like, like all the 50 slash 50 stuff, all the leg lock, all the latest stuff that the Brazilians are coming up with like halfway on Mendez and Cabrina all the spiral and della Hiva. This guy studies it. Like he has ocd, like, like he's obsessed. He's definitely focused, it's important

Speaker 1:          02:05:22       to be around people like that, you know, in life there's always people that are willing to take things to another level that are learning quicker than everybody else, to have more passion that's so important. So important.

Speaker 3:          02:05:33       And it rubs off on a student's. Check this at this, at the. I had, uh, maybe about seven or eight of my schools compete at the tournament and his school, the San Francisco school by far did the best. They were 12 in one. All that. He had four guys competing 12 in one. And the one loss was in the finals. It was like a 30 minute match, 37 minute match and the guy lost, but it was, he didn't even tap. He went to sleep. That's incredible though. Thirty seven minutes. That's amazing. I mean he's got incredible students like future stars like Adam Sachin offi called big Red Adam sached office 230 pounds. His Rubber Guard is insane and he's got black belt level guillotines and endorses and Japanese necktie. And then, and then, uh, my killer brand and Travis Travis Micheala. Yeah. Some crazy stuff. And

Speaker 1:          02:06:23       by the way, if you're in San Francisco, Danny, how did they find your place? A lot of people already come to your place because the podcasts, right? Yes, yes, yes. The year a podcast has helped me. Thank you very much. How do they, how do they get their, uh, were, uh, on, uh, through, through, through Valencia street, suite 100 inside Valencia street muscle, the gym. And my website is 10th Planet Jiu Jitsu SF.com. And for folks who, you know, look, look, I get emails, I get twitter messages all the time saying, thank you. I started doing Jujitsu because of the podcast. For people who think you can't do it, if your, if your body, your body works, you can do it. All right? You don't have to go in there and jump in. They were killers. You take beginning classes, you learn some technique. And it's fun.

Speaker 1:          02:07:02       When the Indian, you know what man, you just gotta you gotta be able to be tapped out. When you get tapped out, just tap, just tap and go right back in and figure out what you did wrong and learn. And it is a vehicle for developing your whole life. All martial arts are yield there. When you get through difficult things, a lot of people never physically get pushed. They don't. They don't understand what it feels like. They don't understand what it's like to, to. To, to really exert yourself and to try hard into grow and accomplish. To accomplish, you know, something. To learn some new techniques to develop an advance. It's so important for that you do.

Speaker 3:          02:07:35       When you get really good at something as difficult as Jujitsu, it makes everything in your life better. And when we say anybody can do it, anybody that's not a sales pitch, anybody can do it. Girl, little girls, little five year old, six year old girls do Jujitsu, old ladies do Jujitsu. Anybody can do it. You know, know contrary to popular belief, you go to Jujitsu school, it's not these barbaric animals that are want to rip your arm off. It's the opposite because the nerds. Yeah, it's mostly classes. I'm also the computer nerds who will kill you. Yeah, exactly. Computer nerds that are addicted to gaming. Like cade, like if you didn't know Kate, you know cade cade Nelson, who's wicked is Jujitsu, is wicked and he's a very small guy. He's like 140 pounds at the most, right? He's not on. He's won 30 black belt, nasty technique, nasty technique, but if you look at him, he's like all skin and bones Mazda, the nicest guy.

Speaker 3:          02:08:33       Nicest guy. You know, it's, it's totally not a bunch of killers who just literally, yes, you learn Jujitsu. You, you are learning how to kill people, but they're not animals. Not mean people. They're like, like really cool, nice folks. You know, like so many of them, like Brent, you know, you look at brand, like what a nice looking guy. He seems like a real friendly, nice to everybody. Check your fucking lights. The sport itself, what it, what, what's going on? What makes it so much fun is a filter for douchebags because in the sport of Jujitsu, you're good. The sport is. The game plan is to tap someone out to put someone in a position, in a choke hold or an arm bar. None of it, which I did. None of it hurts. You just tap out when you feel like you can't get out and you tap out, give up, and then the guy, let's go the whole.

Speaker 3:          02:09:22       So that's like a kill for you. No one got hurt, but you're tapped out. You couldn't get out if you douchebags can't go, can't walk through the fire. Those beginning stages where they're getting tapped out, they're losing the game because they take it too personally. Everybody has an ego, but Douche bags have the biggest egos so they can't go into Jujitsu and and go through the learning phases where they're losing or they're tapping out, losing a game of death. You know, they can't handle it, so they never even get to Jujitsu. The only guys that make it through are the guys that have a complete control of their ego where they tap out at the beginning all the time. You're always losing in the beginning, you're just tapping out. It doesn't hurt. You're tapping out, but your ego can get bruised if you don't have control of it.

Speaker 3:          02:10:05       So what ends up happening is Jujitsu is, is the ultimate douche bag filter. You're left with a bunch of guys that were had no problem tapping out and no problem submitting, no problem dealing with reality because the reality is every dickhead wants to think that he's the full command. Every guy wants to think that, you know, there's so many guys, like if I got into m and a, I'm telling you where it now I'm not ended at MMA, but if I get a new fucking be running shit, fuck GSP, I'm a natural born fighter to some

Speaker 2:          02:10:34       dudes are just natural. And those guys, they can't handle Jujitsu because some little cade dude will choke their fucking lights out, you know? And that's also one of those guys are scared of weed hollow as especially edibles, edibles. Expose your douchey ness as well. Meanwhile, edibles are the best things to roll on. Ooh, I don't like cookie. Realize you just never know how much thc are getting into. We talked about before with lately I've been on, but on a good roll with these trips, I decided a couple couple of pumps for teaching. I'm all good. I don't need to get crazy. You guys ever tried the cold list? No. Dot It's a. it's like a breath thing. You tried it. That was it. Pretty good. Yeah. Yeah. It's amazing. But eventually they're gonna have like fucking filtration systems and air conditioning. When you come into you come into work and just get high.

Speaker 2:          02:11:23       What about the new vapor pens? What does that. Oh, the like old school. Like they look like those magic. The cigarette. Yeah. The cigarettes. Electronic cigarettes. Yeah. Yeah. They're like soaked in thc and there's zero smell. Don't just approach and talk about that because someday you're gonna want to use those in someplace. Meanwhile they're monitoring twitter. These cons. Yeah. We used to. I used to have the electronic wines, but they weren't accurate. You know, like it seemed like you weren't. You just suck on him for awhile and you're like, I'm not getting anything. This is bullshit. It's eventually. It's all gonna. Be Legal. We're, we're, we're battling at right now. Here's some crazy shit that was on MSNBC, MSNBC DOT com. It's for royders in London. These scientists did these studies on people tripping on mash magic mushrooms and they. It's given them the best picture yet of how psychedelic drugs work, and these British scientists are saying the findings suggest that such drugs could be used to treat depression.

Speaker 2:          02:12:16       Absolutely. Yeah. I mean it's amazing. This is not. This is all becoming mainstream shit. One after the other over and over and over again. There's these studies that are coming to light now that are suggesting that all these different drugs, ketamine, they're seeing the ketamine can be used as an instant cure for depression and one of the reasons why kids get addicted to ketamine is the first thing that ketamine does alleviate all your worries, like does one of the reasons why people are doing it so that other suggesting that ketamine can be used as some sort of an antidepressant, as some sort of an instant antidepressant quality, as well as suicide. On two separate studies, the effects of Psilocybin, the active ingredient in magic mushrooms showed that contrary to scientists, scientists expectations, which of course is based on propaganda. It does not increase but rather suppress activity in areas of the brain that are also dampened with other antidepressant treatments, so they don't even understand it. It's like they're saying psychedelics are thought of as mind expanding drugs, so it's been assume that they work by increasing the brain's activity, but they don't. Surprisingly, they found this. Psilocybin actually causes the activity to decrease in areas that have the dentist connections with other areas so they don't know. That makes sense though, so it quiets your brain down so you could have an outer body experience. That makes sense to me. Sort of

Speaker 3:          02:13:32       less activity, less activity. Just like when you meditate, you meditate, you know people are addicted to meditation because you know, if you could, if you could just think, think about one thought, like a water drop or whatever. You get into that zone. People, that zone is the frequency of the universe. That's where everyone's trying to get. They're trying to get that and you do it by just thinking about one thing, so that makes sense. You're quieting your brain, removing all negativity. You're thinking about one thing and it aligns you with the universe. I mean, maybe you know, no one knows exactly what it's doing. I mean, it might just be facilitating evolution. It might just be giving you a better way of thinking because that's my hypothesis because the free the universe is at one frequency that science. So it makes sense that we should try to get to that frequency.

Speaker 3:          02:14:18       If the universe is at a frequency, one frequency all throughout the universe, we know that. It makes sense. What do you mean by that? What's his frequency? You're talking about it. The whole universe is at a frequency, like one frequency, and that was in the debate between a creationism and evolution. That was the strong point, right? There's a science proved that the whole universe at one frequency. So the creationists are saying, see, that's proof of God. That's proof of intelligent design. How could the whole universe by accident be at one frequency frequency mean though? Um, I don't know exactly, but it's like the frequency. What is the frequency of smoking, man? Yeah, that shit is so gross, dude. God Damn. Or they put a fan on or something, but the frequency is like, like what's a frequency of vibration? It's a vibration vibration. Frequency of cigarettes give off.

Speaker 3:          02:15:09       Dude, that's fucking calm for 93 point four brands for real man. Unless you've got a window open or something, you got to send a smoke sucker. Shit ain't doing nothing, man. Know what I mean by that? Like what's a frequency? And it like a radio station is a certain frequency. It's a 95 point five. What is that like? Well, you know what's a frequency and if you turn that dial, Bam, you need to get that frequency on 95 point five. If you were listening to Kayla. Yes. So the pinnacle of science is that they just discovered that the whole universe is one frequency. I don't know what number that is, but it's a certain frequency in music. You got to be on the same frequency or you got to be on frequencies that harmonize with that frequency. So it makes sense. Like to me, it makes sense that if the whole unit so, but, but the scientist saying, no, it doesn't prove intelligent design because we are finding that we're not in just one universe where there's a multiverse, there's, there's endless universes that each one is at a different frequency, so that has improved any intelligent design.

Speaker 3:          02:16:09       I don't really give a shit about that argument, but to me it makes sense. We're trying to get to add on the frequency of the universe and that makes sense to you because I have no idea still and I'm like trying to get on the radio station of the universe. That's, that's another had meditation and Yoga. This is my hypothesis is what? This is what I'm. This is my guess is that Yoga and meditation, unconditional love sex. Certain drugs will get you in the frequency if you love the man. What about dog sex? What about you fucking donkey? It's the same frequency. Is it the same frequency animals? I'm saying the only thing that I'm seeing here is from God like productions, which right away you go, okay. What they're saying is that all

Speaker 1:          02:16:52       beings in the universe connect through a single frequency and there's a bunch of videos I guess you have to watch to, to understand where they're trying to say.

Speaker 3:          02:16:59       Yeah, makes sense to me. I looked tense and it says it's a song from the butthole surfers. Really bad. It's a good song. Yeah. I mean, no one knows what

Speaker 1:          02:17:12       the fuck is going on when you were on mushrooms. It's, it's certainly something that should be studied though. And that's what I think is missing in, in, you know, and people's ideas of mushrooms. Everybody's got this propaganda based opinion on it. Everybody thinks it's bad for you. I mean, I'm, I remember I had this conversation with Michio Kaku wants when we're on the opiod anthony show and I suggested a, you know, I asked him if he's ever done mushrooms and you know, he asked like I said like, Hey, you know, you ever, you ever smoke crack? You ever do math? You know, it's like, to a lot of people that's like the same thing. Like you say, do mushrooms and they don't want to mess up their brain, but so much insight, so many different people have come up with insights because directly related to psychedelic experiments, and I don't know if it's true, but the rumor was that Francis Crick, when he, when he was dying, admitted that he was a frequent user of lsd and then that's how he came up with the idea, the concept of the double helix of DNA, you know, that he came up with and under the influence of the LSD has been an up a bunch of this.

Speaker 1:          02:18:06       I think the guy's name was carrie. Another guy came up with other insights on LSD and it's been geneticists and different people that have done Iowasca that have had weird ideas and expand on these ideas that came directly as a result of psychedelic experiences. Who knows what it is, man? I don't know, but it would be awesome if they were allowed people to fuck it, study it instead of locked you in a fucking cage for experiencing something that's been here a lot longer than people have. You know, so stupid. It's just we have a bunch of stupid people, like we were talking before, this happened about, uh, the presidential debates about watching,

Speaker 3:          02:18:40       like watching Newt Gingrich is hilarious. Like how is he even even in the presidential race, I mean that you're saying that guy doesn't rob him and Mitt Romney are arguing about because they both had an investments in some, some, uh, they both made money off the economy going to shit based on their investments and they both did, but there were arguing live on tv, on CNN about who invested more and that that alone should tell people that are both full of shit. Well, he just lost the Kim and second place in Florida new. Can you imagine if Newt Gingrich's, the president, Mitt Romney, Mitt Romney met with a kid who had cerebral palsy and he marijuana

Speaker 2:          02:19:28       would say, why don't you wouldn't even answer him. He wouldn't even answer. You said, what? You put me in jail. He said, well, you could try synthetic marijuana synthetic. Marilyn. He was suggesting that that was a good idea that I'm not for medical marijuana. I've told you I'm not for it. Like you're not for it, you're telling for why, why? For what reason? Under what reason. Why? Because you're a whore because all these goddamn companies that gets you into the position that you're in right now tell you that that's the stance that you should take. See that video of Mitt Romney's flipping and flopping. There's an awesome a mormon man. Not that there's anything wrong with being a mormon, but when you're a mormon, you're not allowed to run the presidency. You're not around the run the country. You're just not. You're not allowed to any wacky religion.

Speaker 2:          02:20:10       If you're a super catholic, and I know jfk was a Catholic and everything like that, but this is with different times. It's 2012. You know? Really, you believe that Joseph Smith, a 14 year old kid that lived in 18, 20 pound golden tablets that represented the last work of Jesus. The guy was a con man, unknown con man. He said he found a stone and the secret stone and he looked through the stone and he could read the large works. Jesus really, really come on, man, which was that in a goof ball. It's just, it's just fucking amazing, man. You know, I have friends that are friends of friends actually that are Mormons that I know. They're very nice people. It's one of the nicest religions and what it gives them that's great is a great sense of community like they have. Their churches have been a mormon churches before.

Speaker 2:          02:20:56       They have a really nice sense of community. They're very nice to each other and they really promote that they're promote like that feeling of family and that positive frequency and it does really. It really makes a difference. Man, you know, I, I was at a mormon funeral recently and these people, man, they really believed that this guy was in a better place and it really helped them that their loved one had passed on into a better place. It really did and I and I, I really support that. I think that's awesome, but just just that's just because the ideology happens to be in a good frequency, but if you break down what the ideology stands for, it's ludicrous. It's absolutely ridiculous. It's absolutely doing some good for some of these people, but so would just being nice, it would do the exact same thing, so we'll just being humble and giving into love and just being nice to people.

Speaker 2:          02:21:40       You don't need some wacky shit that was made by a con man, a 14 year old con man who found golden tablets and then when the people came to him like, where are these tablets? He was older angels took them away. Angels took. It's like, it's like, you know, it's such a dumb story. It's a terrible story. Yeah. I mean, to me, I growing up, I despised all religions. I thought I thought it was all just crap and destroying society, but as I get older, I, for me, my opinion on religions, if you do it right, if it's based on unconditional love and doing the right thing, different religions are just like. It's a way to get your soul and the right frequency. There's different ways. Get your body physically,

Speaker 3:          02:22:26       like there's kettlebells and then there's some people like to just run. Some people like to swim, all different ways to get your body align, and I think all religions, as long as you do it right, whether it's Muslim or whatever, cat, Catholicism, like my grandma, she did it right. All she cared about was doing things for others and she was hardcore Catholic. Went to church every day. That was per exercise of the soul. That is what got her frequency in the right place. Some people do yoga, some people meditate. Some people you know, believe this. Some people worship rocks. If you really believe rock the rock is the frequency of the universe and it gets your soul in the right place. Um, I'm all for it.

Speaker 2:          02:23:03       It's an idea of just believing in something and then having a code that you live by and moving your life always in a positive way, and that's good. No matter what you call it. What do you call it? Hindu do you call it Kundalini Yoga, where you call it Catholicism. If you're really moving in a positive direction and you really believe in love and you really are being warm and open and you've given the idea of giving into a higher power is not because God wants you to be humble where God wants you to be in all of his greatness. What, what it, what it is is saying there's something above you, so not taking yourself so fucking seriously and instead not being out for number one and sort of realizing that we are together. Like there is a brotherhood and sisterhood of man, you know, that's, that's really what it's supposed to be all about.

Speaker 2:          02:23:51       That's the good of religion. And that's where I've seen religion help people for sure. And that was just like you growing up man. And it was both of us was the same reason because we had seen the system fail us. You know, we had seen all these people that were supposed to be correct and you know, these people that were supposed to be adults. We saw they were retarded. We saw there were assholes. We saw that was all bullshit. We saw that, you know, religion was being used negatively a lot of the time and it was a lot of guilt and there was a lot of yelling at you and it was a lot of. So we just, we just trashed. So

Speaker 3:          02:24:21       I like, I would never, if my grandmother was still alive, I would never try to like knock some sense into her, try to prove that the Bible is written by Matt. It worked for her. That was her kettlebells right there for assault. It worked for like, you know, and well, you know, that's the way I look at it now. I think religion is, is if you do it right in and uh, you're, you know, you always look to do the right thing and it's all life is all about a selflessness and a unconditional.

Speaker 2:          02:24:53       And what people don't understand is that benefits your man. You know, you can be, do, do that and do it in a selfish way. I mean, it sounds stupid, but if you're a selfish person, you really want to succeed. You really want good things for you. You want to do it selfishly, be nice to everybody. That's the best way to get ahead. The best way to get ahead is just be nice to everybody. Tip people whenever you can, tip more than you're supposed to. Tip. Give people hugs. When you can be nice to people all the time. When you put out that good energy, you get good energy back. You can like almost of it like people are almost looking out for number one, you really want to look out for number one, look out for everybody else. Look out for everybody else and that's how you really look out.

Speaker 2:          02:25:30       For number one, I have had the most benefit in my life by being nice to me, but the most benefit in my life by being generous and being friendly and being warm and every time I have not been that, it's always fucked me and when I run into someone, especially now at this stage of my life when I've had my own personal revelations in my own successes and failures and have kind of assessed what what helps me and what doesn't help me. When I run into someone that's life is a mess and I run into someone that's got a lot of troubles, God damn it. If it's not a big chunk of what the fuck got them. There is the way they think about things, the way they behave. Think about things the way they take a cigarette. Fucking throw it in the street. You don't realize why your life is kind of shit while you're littering everywhere like that.

Speaker 2:          02:26:11       That's not. You're not putting out good energy while you're throwing you fucking mcdonalds bag out the window because no one's looking. You're being a cunt. You're fucking up man. You're, you're, you're ruining space. You're sending out bad things. When you fuck somebody over in a business deal, you're like, well, I profited.

That guy hates you because people you fucked over in that bad development deal or whatever the hell you did wrong. Those people don't like you. Now. They hate you and that's gonna. Come your way, do nice things and nice things come from it, man. Think always. Think, talk and act man. And that's the best way to end this bitch. Right? Let's wrap this motherfucker up.

Stand up. everything beautiful. I love jake is good dude. Alright, thanks everybody. Thanks to fleshlight for sponsoring the podcast. And uh, they were the first sponsor and we will always be loyal to theM as much as people give a shit about it. Oh, I should probably say something about this fear factor thing. Yeah. Fairfax had got pulled off the air. Uh, we weRe supposed to have a, an episode where contestants drank donkey, semen and a donkey urine. Um, apparently folks think it's too much. I agree. Okay. After we did it, I'm going to be honest with you guys, and I haven't told anybody this, but I think I got high with you after it was over that day.

Speaker 1:          02:30:58       And I remember thinking, I might haVe told you, but I think we fucked up, man. I think we went too far. I just, it just seemed wrong, man. I'm like, people are not going to like, this is gonna make people angry. Whatever. Man. Somebody. Somebody signed off on it. And then apparently the baCklash was crazy and it shut down your thoughts all together, all the episode, the episode. and there's one episode that's gonna air. February is our next one, and there's one other two hour ePisode that's gonna air. Sometime after that they haven't figured out when I put it on the dvd. No, no, no, no, no. I think it's never going to go anywhere. It's going to be buried and I'll never do it again. I think they went too far showing throw this shit and not really. But the stents are so much bigger now.

Speaker 1:          02:31:36       This show is so much bigger and crazier that they tried to push everything. I just think they went too far. I think it was nutty, but I don't think they went to. I know exactly where there's. Everybody has their own standards. I just don't think that it's fair to ask people to do that. It sounds ridiculous coming from me. What? They don't have to do it. I know they don't have to, but I mean to ask them to do it, I think it would've been cool if everybody said go fuck yourself. And then we had like scrap stunt. It would have been funny. Have you had that happen yet? No, but that would have been a good time, you know? Um, but, you know, I think it was way easier for girls to do that guys, you know, obviously, I mean for real, even girls were even joking around about it.

Speaker 1:          02:32:11       It was way easier fitting it on their chest and rubbing it in. Oh, brian, that's your world. And you live in a dark world. Uh, so look, I'm, I'm sure if we had go back in time they wouldn't do it again. And the only way you find the limits of these things is you push them. You know, I think it was a mistake. Oops. So it's over. And uh, it, it would probably never see the light of day or five years from now it'll air because there's no way they would have considered doing it five years ago when fear factor went through its first run. I mean, in season one it was so tame and calm and easy and, and, you know, and small compared to what it's like now. Now it's just ridiculous. The stumps are huge and crazy and explosions and nuts. Who knows if they'll ever show that again.

Speaker 1:          02:32:53       I, you know, I'd rather than not, I think people shouldn't have to do that. I think it's too much. They fucked up, but you know, whatever we learn, kill the show kelly episode and we'll march on because we got some good episodes coming up. It's a better way, a better show than it ever was before, you know, I hope this doesn't fuck it up for everything else, but uh, I think everybody realizes that was a mistake including nbc and, you know, they wanted to push things and just, you know, you don't find out how bad things are until you get people's reactions. And that's the reaction. Woopsies we're sorry, sorry. Um, so that's it. So I've commented on that. So go to a. Oh, dina dina, thursday night, right here, 10:00 PM a thursday, thursday night.
