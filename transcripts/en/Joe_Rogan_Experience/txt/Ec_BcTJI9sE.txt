Speaker 1:          00:00:03       Hello freaks. I'm fucking multitasking right now as I speak to you. I am actually tweeting that were live and a lot of people, oh like dude, you can't do that. And I'm like, dude, I can, I'm fucking bad ass. I don't like that. I also turned the volume off on my computer at the same time. I give zero fucks. I really do. Boom tweet. Dun Dun Dun.

Speaker 2:          00:00:33       This episode of the Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by Squarespace. Squarespace is having a contest. That's why we're doing two of them this week. And what Squarespace is is the easiest, simplest way to get a really bad ass website. And when I say a bad ass website, I mean they look fucking completely and totally professional. It looks like you spent a shitload of dollars doing it, but in fact you did it yourself. It's super easy to do. And Squarespace is having a contest right now to sort of accentuate that because the feedback of Squarespace has been so excellent and their contest is a, we're going to pick, we have the up to this week, January 17th it ends and we're going to pick four of the baddest, most sweetest websites and for the people that you have created, those four baddest, sweetest websites, we're going to give them my free gear of Squarespace and we're going to send those winters a swag bag with items like a Squarespace, apple keyboard, t-shirt, mole skin, and more.

Speaker 2:          00:01:36       What do they have sound on their website? How dare they fucking age of they live in, in these freaks. Oh, they put sound on my website when it opens up so that it immediately starts annoying. The shit out of you is a video I was playing. You know those old school websites, you'd go to them and they immediately start mind use to my space. I remember there's like five different songs going at the same time and glitter tags. Don't forget glitter tags work later. Tags. What'd you just take a modafinil? What that is? No, you sure you don't want to Xanax? No, no, no. This is a, it's actually like speed. Really? Yeah. It was just the opposite. It's not really speed. It's, um, it's, it's actually called Nuvigil is what it is. That if I'm a, if I'm tired and I want to fire him my brain up, I can pop one of those. And it's actually an experiment because I tried something called sledging this weekend and Jamie and I were actually just talking about it. This guy, a doctor, Mark Gordon was here and he gave me these, uh, these, uh, smart drugs and uh, just we tried it. We both tried a dose of it and a interesting, interesting stuff. So I'm comparing it to just feel more lucid. I don't know. I'm not sure. I'm not sure.

Speaker 2:          00:02:49       You know, it's hard. It's hard to tell. Like what was my, the fact that I got a good eight hour sleep. What was the fact that they good food? What was the why? I think they're all sort, they all play a part

Speaker 1:          00:03:00       of the thing to really find out, you'd have to have a baseline where you ate like the exact same foods, did the exact same activities, got the exact same amount of sleep. You'd have to have that baseline and then add in something. But I take so many different nutrients, vitamins and fucking nootropics and all these different things without prescriptions. And that's all legal stuff. So most of it is nutrients. Most of them, it's just vitamins, keeping the brain sharp. Dominic, you guys stay on the ball. They think it's amazing, man. Margic you already go on stage. All of a sudden your mind clicks into a different gear. Well, you know, well first of all, you and I are both eating Dick on stage four. That's fucking terrible feeling. So you're prep as a side. Let me get through these commercial. Okay, so we can just start podcasts.

But as far as computers, dessert, I would not, I would not put you in the wizard category. I think you could build a website on Squarespace. We should have a context to see if dom or Eric and bill the webspace on squares.

Speaker 1:          00:05:21       If we got you lick it up. You can figure it out. If you had like a hot assistant, you know, maybe a hot Japanese assistant. Ms. Dot. Yeah. None of them. None of them. When my, when my computer comes on and I go, yes, I did again, my man, you're wrong baby. Uh, we're also brought to you by ting. Ting is, uh, one of the Squarespace and ting or two of my favorite podcast sponsors because they're both two podcast sponsors that I haven't had a single person tell me anything bad about. And then of course someone listening to this right now. I was like, yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:06:01       Oh God. Oh, the first fuck tin can suck my Dick in squares spaces filled with cons. Fuck you, Joe Rogan.

Speaker 1:          00:06:12       Um, ting is a great, is a great way to save money and use a sprint backbone. You don't have to worry about being on some mom and pop cell phone network. They use one of the biggest cell phone networks in the country and they do it, you know, it's weird. They're from Canada and they don't, you know, they're like, they don't operate in Canada. They operate in the United States. I mean, you could roam in Canada, but they're a Canadian company that works in the United States. Yeah. It's weird. It's from Toronto. I, but yeah. Um, I think, yeah. Um, anyway, great guys and their idea of great gals too. I'm sure there's some awesome gals working there. I don't want to be sexist. Um, but their, their ideas sell you awesome cell phone service and do so in an ethical way. A NO BS mobile service, if you will.

Speaker 1:          00:06:51       And um, they have no contracts, no early termination fees and they even have an early termination fee relief program. If you're paying an early termination fee to come to ting, they will give you up to $75 back. They will credit you 25% of your early termination fee, which is up to $75 per device. It's really a great company. I really liked the idea behind this. Sell you something that's really excellent and do it in a way that doesn't make you feel like you're getting fucked. 98% of all people who switched to ting saved money. I mean, I've had three very good friends that have done it. Brian's done it. Dr Chris Ryan did it and you know, they rave about it, it's excellent. And you really do save money. Um, kinds of money. The other guys charge you if you go over your allocated minutes, texts and data.

Speaker 1:          00:07:39       But if you have a heavier month on Ting, you just pay for what you used. It's really simple. So no mysterious items on your bill and unlimited devices on one plan. You can have as many devices as you want on one plan, sharing, pooled minutes, messages, megabytes, everything. Each device on a plan costs a flat $6 per month. They have, it's really good deals. And the phones they sell are all the highest end android phones. All the really cool ones. Like the galaxy note three, which is what I have. And Brian has the um, the galaxy s four, which is an another excellent phone. The HTC one is an excellent phone. It used to be at one point in time that iPhone was the king and everything else just sucked. But it's very close now. And then I fact I give the edge to android.

Speaker 1:          00:08:26       It's just because their screens are bigger. It's a way better experience if you're, if I'm reading my text messages or watching a video that someone sent me, it's just a better experience on that big screen. Sorry Paul. I know you can't hearing this from me and I know we were together for so long. You know what I wanted is that new flexible phone? Have you seen that? It flexes the whole phone, but that's, I believe it's just the screen, right? I'm a screen. Isn't that what that stuff's called? It's like a type of class. That plastic you could work out with the phone. You could do a little in between the legs like Suzanne Somers and get your thigh master. Ron Her don't make fun of her. She's a beautiful woman is hot. It's hot as fuck. Tink. Go to tanning rogan.tank.com and uh, you'll save $25 off your first ting device when you sign up.

Speaker 1:          00:09:13       rogan.ting.com. We Love Ting. They're an awesome company. We're also brought to you by [inaudible] Dot com that's o. N. N. I. T. They have a state on it program now, which uh, all the Onnit products you love automatically delivered to your door each month at the lowest price guaranteed.

Speaker 1:          00:10:10       I mean, you're not going to get there intellectually, but if you could just, just become a man through these, lose too much weight. Looking at my face, I want you to be brutally honest. You're not gone. Your delicious. Thank you. You look soft and lovable. I just took a Calgon bath before I came over. Smooth skin. You actually still not a man who has to work too hard outside in the cold, frigid temperatures. I haven't done anything since I started doing standup. I never worked. I don't have a tool and I went to, that's good. That's a real comic. That's why you're still flooding.

Everything's good. Joe. You're a real comedian. Dom Irrera you know, you're just saying that for folks who didn't listen to the commercial part, you don't have a tool. You know, you'd ever done a thing. He never turned a wrench. There's two bucks. There's two, two bucks in my house. And they were the lifts to women that live with me. That having a broad tool box,

Speaker 4:          00:11:54       I can't even lift it is when they can't lift. I don't know how soap you lifted it. That's hilarious. Every time somebody shakes my hand, they go mijo just soft hands. Oh, the butter like butter. Smooth. Yeah. That's, uh, that's, I really do believe that there's a real, there's a real factor in that you've remaining on top of your game all these years. It was like you surely you truly like completely. You know, you're a comedian. That's it. That's what you're capable of. I love it. I could do it in a hammock. I followed crystal Lee and the other night at the, he did a standing ovation and lift factor, right? I walk in and this was true. I had just woken up. I took a nap like at nine o'clock at night and the audience was standing. I don't know. I said, first of all, it's Chris just got a standing ovation.

Speaker 4:          00:12:41       I just woke up. I said, uh, I was just in the bath tub, like a big fat fag. So Lazy. The only reason I was taking a bath cause to the stand up and shape, right? And I said to the crowd, and then what would you do if you were me? What the fuck am I supposed to do? Fly around the room, you know? What do you mean after he, after he, after he had a standing ovation and am I supposed to fly around the room and said no, tell me what to do. They were with me because it was honest, you know. But the thing is what and what you were saying about just I give a fuck. Totally, but I don't give a fuck. Like I could do it in a hammock at this point. Let's just my head out doing stand. That's actually not a bad idea.

Speaker 4:          00:13:19       That be pretty funny. For 30 a good act. They were just laying there. Yeah. Especially like if it was a part of like a comedy festival. Even a regular set. Ladies and gentlemen, we present you dom. I Rarer Anna Hammer and you just swinging back and forth with a wireless microphone in the air and talking shit man. Have things changed since I started doing the show? Redman is now taking x on the road with him. Yeah. Believe he took Tiffany Haddish, which I said, you know Tiffany? Yeah, sure. I said it's beautiful, right? But I said I would be afraid to fuck Tiffany or even at him cause I just, I'm intimidated by her and the Senseo. You call that a Dick White boy. I'll snap that motherfucker off. Have you ever seen her queef until Michael Fun.

Speaker 1:          00:14:00       She closed it in Dallas and it brought down the house. People just couldn't understand it was happening. Like it was like a good ten second pause where everyone's face. It was like, wait that, that just happened, that and then it just destroyed. So she just put the microphone in her box and she had been on stage for 30 minutes. I had a wet pussy. She's mostly, she had a whip was even being on stage, especially said turn yourself. What's amazing that honestly really the cheese, the first one to think of sticking a microphone in her pussy and [inaudible]. I don't remember it being done before. I would have thought that someone would have picked that up by now. He's a cunt pioneer. Yeah. But if you really think about it, isn't it incredible that it's 2014 for her? What was it like 2012 when did she start queen?

Speaker 1:          00:14:47       She was on the podcast and the icehouse chronicles like what? Two years ago maybe. Maybe it might've been either 12 2012 or 2013 either one of them either a year or two a year and a half ago. But she was, she was quite often, and I was thinking then I was like, I don't think anybody does this. It's kind of amazing. But you would've thought that somebody would have locked that down. I mean, that's been around for a long time. The fact that no one's stuck a microphone. Has any guy just committed to just farting on stage all the time? I mean as as one. Is this her doing it? Okay, let's hear it.

Speaker 5:          00:15:23       Okay.

Speaker 6:          00:15:24       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:15:30       hey

Speaker 6:          00:15:31       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:15:35       part of a fart too, man. I got tell you really impressed pitches on stage. If you see it close up, tilt her back a little and you could see her sucking air in. So now you have to follow that. Tony did, and he's sick right now. He might've from the microphone, I think. Oh Geez. Oh, could you imagine if he really died? You actually caught aids from microphone. You're like, what the fuck man. Not saying the Tiffany Haddish I say that. All right. But yeah. God Damn Man.

Speaker 5:          00:16:09       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:16:09       She's a lot of fun though, man. I'm so proud of her. She's, she's on the Arsenio Hall now are trying to build out after this episode. Well, it is fascinating to me. I mean it's just, first of all, it's fascinating because it's, even though you say a woman's onstage, she could rapper sure. Vagina. She could point to it. She could show it to you. But when someone starts talking with it, like you know that noise came from that vagina that is several levels. She's just have a levels more intimate. Her Pussy, he's talking to you. There's Texas girls didn't know how to act either. Their faces. No one should know how to act. Listen, no one on the planet. We know that act is cause we're deviants. We're deviants and we've been around fucked up people our entire lives. I mean you, you've been around no one but fucked up people since we started working together and I've been around no one but fucked up people for a decade before that. So our, you know, our perspective is a bit skewed. The boyfriend drive to the thing telling his girlfriend and the show maybe a little.

Speaker 1:          00:17:16       Yeah. Imagine if a girl was like, really seriously Christian and I'll go to the show because I think Brian rent bands. Cute. But I heard that this girl Tiffany Haddish Mike say tannic. No, Joe. Do you remember the hooker that we interviewed a long time ago on the Joe Show? Yeah. Yeah, in the parking lot of the comedy store. She was like telling us how she did the business and stuff. I was really stoned. I was like, I wonder if she's still a hooker. And I found her online still hooker. Oh my God. Then what, like 10 years. She didn't, she didn't get out of law school. No. Geez.

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       It's so weird how easy it was to find her too. Yeah, it's, I'm torn. I gotta be honest. I'm torn on the whole idea of prostitution because I feel like I always feel like you should be able to do whatever the fuck you want. If you want to have sex with someone for free, you should be able to have sex with someone for free. If a guy wants $1,000, if you jerk him off and you're like, all right, then you should be able to do that. It should be legal. That should be no more, no more, no more different than if you wanted to get a massage like no one wants a massage. You man, you're paying them to massage you. When you go to a spa and you get a rub down for an hour, that person does not want to do that. You're giving them money and they're making you feel good with their fingers, like you should be able do whatever the fuck you want and it's all our societal standards that are fucked up and weird about sex.

Speaker 2:          00:18:43       That said, when I hear that someone's a hooker like that and it's been a hooker for 10 years, that does not feel good. It feels sad. It feels like she's a lost and she's in a bad place and I'm torn because I don't know if that's my own bias perceptions. Like maybe she's meeting a bunch of people that are like really desperate for touch and you know, maybe she picks good clientele and they have sex and she, that's what she gets paid. And who gives a fuck? Maybe it's not. Maybe it's that. I mean, but instantly you say that she's still a hooker. I'm like, but I'm like, I'm questioning myself. I'm like, why? You know, why does it always have to be bad? Is it because we've associated sex with something that you're naughty, you're not supposed to do it. So someone doing it for a living and somehow or another a bad thing I used to get after I fucked a regular girl, like on the road.

Speaker 2:          00:19:32       Why? Just taking just cause it was wild. There was the curiosity of it. If I had one answer, Tj's left, he seriously, I would get like, I have like say like a waitress or something on the road club. Then she'd go and then they call a prostitute, right? Total addict. Oh, that's hilarious. Thank God for blood pressure medications. Do you think that's part of, that's just being an Italian? Yeah, I really do. Um, you know, there's always been that like ridiculous stereotype of Italians is like oversexed goons definitely is a reason why that stereotype is and not for Chinese guys. Okay. There's a reason why that stereotype is not for, you know, fill in the blank. It's like for oversexed a Pysch goons for Italians is because they are like, fuck shelfy for five years, every day, every day, a couple, at least a couple of times a day.

Speaker 2:          00:20:24       Even when she was reading, I didn't need to know that, but now that I do, I feel better. Yeah. It's uh, it's uh, the, my, all my ancestors, my fucking, my family back home. Like, although the Italians I knew and that I grew up with, they were savages. They would have grandmas, they call him like they take the Gomar out on a Friday night and then the white powder on a Saturday. Did you see that new movie? American hustle? I fell asleep. I heard that movie sucks from so many people. I don't know. I'm asleep. I don't know. Do you like it? You gotta Watch it again? I enjoyed that movie. I have it at home. They sent it to me so I sent it to me. It's like, oh did he bragging about the stag thing? They said what kind of a brag is that if it gets bootlegged we know where it came from cause dom I rare really knows.

Speaker 2:          00:21:10       Those knew I had to agree to a, I had accepted the agreement like they're going to trace it right. Well there's a new thing they have now. Somebody told me about online we can get movies as they come out, they cost 500 bucks and it's like you have like a box in your house and that box stores a certain amount of movies. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. I'll send you the information. I sent it to the guy who did the ab in this place, my buddy and uh, he said, yeah, it's legit. He said it's a new thing. It sets up to your house. You could store like x amount of movies. You could have like 10 movies on it. And they one time and they're all in your name and they don't go anywhere. They just plug it in this box and you can play it on your TV and the each movie cost like 500 bucks.

Speaker 2:          00:21:49       Wow. Which is weird man. It's like Dan is a lot of fucking money. But I was at the movie theater, I went to see American hustle and this couple behind us just kept talking and it was a, not very many people in the theater, so they were talking pretty loud because there was no one next to them. And people just don't realize, they probably don't even realize you're being rude because they thought they were far away. But you don't realize how far your voice carry shit. Nobody else is trying to, yeah, I was just going to say that I was going to bring that up and it's really frustrating. But you know, I just dealt with it and watched the movie. I didn't say anything, but a guy got shot in Florida so a retired cop had a gun on him and he was texting.

Speaker 2:          00:22:26       It wasn't even, and he was texting, texting in the theater and this cop wound up getting in an altercation with them. I mean that's step one and then step, you know, ultimate step 10 or whatever it is, is he shot him. Who knows what happened. The cop could have asked him and the you could have gone, fuck you bitch. Or of course has gotten crazy, you know, 72 years old or something to, well maybe he's just ready to die on his own. And he was like, start killing kids until one of them gets me. That's why I like arc light. Cause normally you could pick your seats, but then if there's somebody that's talking or something, there's like a guy that just pretty much stands in that movie. They, they're on it like that. Yeah, you're right. There's another place called Sinny apolis that's even more dope.

Speaker 2:          00:23:03       They have these giant lounge chairs fully recross the recline, they sell food. The food's really delicious and it's a way better experience. People don't fucking dog, so it might be worth the 500 bucks is my point. To have a new movies as they come out, we might be worth, what you do is you get the box and you set up a camera in a dark room and you film it and then when we make a DVD of it and then we sell it to her friends for $20 each and you get the $500 but you want to go to jail and just retarded. Which one is the, that was my first line to him when I, first time we did the show, it was the way we met. What are you retarded? I loved how you handled it. It was beautiful. It is.

Speaker 2:          00:23:43       How do you handle it? You, oh, are you handling it when you met him, called him what it is? Well, I think I was right, but I love him. I don't know if I would pay 500 bucks for a movie though. That seems like a lot of goddamn money. That seems like at this point in time it's like, come on, unless you really don't, you know, unless you're really annoyed by the public and then have that much money, it doesn't matter. But the problem is the more you do shit like that, if you, you know, you could become a hermit man, you could be, we come a hermit. If you really paid attention to how goofy people are, you get really at one point in time forced yourself into the mountain somewhere and just fucking be completely isolated. You handle it well. You handled it really well.

Speaker 2:          00:24:20       You have a lot of patients. It's not hard. It's a bunch of people being nice to you. But when we're shooting pool and somebody wants to take a picture, that's a little too much. Well, it gets annoying that that gets annoying when you're in the middle of some obvious activity. Or, um, when you're eating, you're eating is a dumb one. That's like, come on. I'm saying with a mouthful to shake your hand too. They want to shake your hand. They want you to come. I've had a lady in, um, Vegas asked me to come over towards, I'm in the middle of eating. I had a mouthful of food. Hi, we're from Canada. We would like it if you could come over to our table. And I'm like, what? Like I'm eating. No, I'm not going to get away. Like how, why would you ask someone? I couldn't imagine going up to someone I didn't know and just ask them to come over to our table. We're big fans of fear factor. I could come over to our table.

Speaker 2:          00:25:06       I remember when Bruce Willis for first started getting famous Spec of the Improv in the 80s and this guy comes up to me, he starts shaking his hand and he wouldn't let it go and just keep sending with Bruce just looking at me and he goes, and the guy goes, don it, get the, get the, get the camera, get the camera out of the car down. Like he was holding them hostage. So they took a picture. That's when I first saw it at any, anyone of my friends get that glimpse of fame and the annoying part of it. Wow. He just held onto and get the camera and he's shaking bruises and Bruce was looking at me like I'm supposed to do it. Can't win. When he'd be pulled away, you'd fucking punch him. Whether you do, some people are definitely crazy. Some people are just too excited to meet someone like Bruce Willis too.

Speaker 2:          00:25:42       It's like, it's not natural. I don't know what they think's going to happen. It's kind of cool, like if you see Bruce Wells, like Ooh, that's Bruce was, that's a, you know, that's the guy from moonlighting as the guy from die hard. Yeah. That's Bruce Willis. He was in fucking pulp fiction. Yeah. I always tell people just enjoy their work. Enjoy the work. Leave him alone. Because if they met some people, they'd be such a fucking disappointment to them. Yeah. You know, mall. I don't know man. It's just, some people just aren't used to it. In California, I think way more people are used to see famous people don't bother you here. They don't say thank you. I like your work til after the check has done. So they're not trying to pump up the tip. You know? There's a little bit of that, I'm sure. Um, but California doesn't give a fuck.

Speaker 2:          00:26:22       It's like if you're famous or not famous, there's so many famous people here. It's not that big of a deal. But if you're a famous person like say and you moved to Iowa or something like that, that wasn't your be, oh, you know, I know that just as a comedian because in Columbus, Ohio I get recognized more than I can recognize that here. But I might get recognized but they don't give a fuck. Well you have a big following. You know, it's Kinda interesting how comics develop followings in one city or another. And I'm never really quite understood that. But you know how there's that issue, like the, the best examples that Guy Bob Marley, I love Bob Marley. Great Guy, great salted, the goofball sweetheart of a guy. I've known him for 20 plus years. Bob, I knew Bob when Bob was an open mic or in Maine who would come down and do a Nick's comedy stop and he would, uh, he did a guest set, one of our shows on the road cause he was like a, the Bangor House comedian and this place. But it's so real sweetheart of a guy and a very funny guy. But my point is that he's a huge act in Maine. Yeah. Like people, he sells books and albums and you might have heard of them like most of you know, fuel. If you're a comedy fan, you know, you might've heard them on Sirius satellite radio or seen him on comedy central or something like that, but he would have no idea.

Speaker 4:          00:27:40       Tell me a great story about Billy crystal. They get into a, um, an elevator, him and Chuck Bra, Butch Bradley and Billy Crystal was in Bible goes in and Brooklyn, hey Billy will, you know, nice to meet were comedians. And he just kind of went, you know, like kind of ignored him. And Bob says to me, cause I didn't know whether the fuck can push the stop button and beat the fuck out or just let it go. He said, so he let it go.

Speaker 2:          00:28:05       Wow. Billy crystal probably stopped being a comedian somewhere along the line. Well, you know what I mean about stop being a comedian. Oh yeah. If that, if you do that, you stopped being a comedian.

Speaker 4:          00:28:14       Well he was always really nice to me and then one time I interviewed, I interviewed him and De Niro for this comedy central thing and he was real smug and shit. Like he turned against me and I was like, good scenario like is kind of thick, you know. And I said to him, cause he sang when mentally like he's not real, he's not, he's not there, you know, like real quick. I mean he's a great actor, but uh, that's, that's a whole different story. But the Nero, I said to him, cause he sang and analyze that and I said, I love your singing. And I always look, there's more than anything, I love your singing obviously. I'm kidding. I go, I says, you had the definitive Tevye in fiddler on the roof and De Niro goes, oh, thank you. It's all right. Like you don't fucking get it. He was barely paying attention to and Billy was like, that's exactly what it was. I'm Billy was like, you know, kind of snapping at me. I'm thinking, man, Bill, you turn on me. I'm another comedian just to go with it.

Speaker 2:          00:29:02       I think sometimes a guy like him, we'll get tired of being the center of attention, you know, because I think also to be that kind of an actor, he's not who deniro. Yeah. To be that kind of an actor.

Speaker 4:          00:29:13       Don't you think he's lost some of his legacy though by the doing these stupid films? He's definitely has. But I'll tell you what. He was in American hustle and he's fucking gangster in it. Yeah, he's bad ass. I love the guy. He's has very small part, but it's vintage dinero but that's my question. Like what? When you work that much and you have taxi driver and raging bull in your itinerary, your resume, where are you going to go from there? I mean, he was just wants to work. So he's doing the Fockers and all this stuff. Well, maybe he enjoys

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       it. The thing, I mean, it's like he obviously enjoys working, you know, it's a lot of pressure to be so big that you can't just do medium shit, you know? Well, he put in some of the greatest performances of all time, the Cape Fear. Oh, he's fucking Jesus Christ. When he was in the empty theater with the, the, yeah. The girl when she be putting his finger, his finger in her mouth, that was fucking wild. It was wild. It was a fucking crazy movie. He was one of the scariest guys ever as a medicine guy. And taxi drivers. Yeah. Well, he always deteriorated. Even in King of comedy, he got crazier and crazier as the movie went on. King of comedy. Oh my God. If Rupert Pumpkin, you know what I saw the other day, um, uh, I'm going to have to sit down and watch the whole thing, but I was flipping through the channels and it was on, was it flipping through channels or was I want whatever.

Speaker 2:          00:30:33       Somehow or another I was watching a small piece of it, deer hunter. Oh yeah. I was having a fucking God, damn, that's a good movie. I got to stop it. And I said, you know, I can't start it in the middle here and just watch it from here. I'm going to, I'm going to come back to this, watch this as a full movie. I did. That movie deserves to be washed as a full movie, just flipping through the channels and catch that. Not because this is sons of Italy day, but the switch to one of the, no, to put the switch to one of the Italian Pachino in dog day afternoon. You ever see that fantastic movie? I saw it again last year. Fucking incredible. Fantastic movie. But yeah. What a weird plot too. Oh yeah. There was just shrinks change your story. Yeah. Yeah. But it like the geneal though.

Speaker 2:          00:31:13       I mean, um, uh, uh, John could says no. Uh, who's the, it was that it was the Cino. No, but she knows buddy who's pitching from, he was famous phrase though. He, yeah, exactly. Yeah. He played such a weird freaky character. And pachino was so on. It was like there was, it was such a different person, like this kind of guy who's robbing a bank to pay for a sex change. Yeah. Yeah. Normal seemed a little too together to be that guy almost a little too. They went outside. That was one of Attica came from Attica. Attica. That was a big movie, man. Yeah, we can now he's reading about him because they didn't want to cast him in the Godfather. Michael Corleone, you know who they wanted for it to Redford. Really? Robert Redford. Right. And then they, then they watched and somehow the Coppola one that him and he finally got him in.

Speaker 2:          00:32:10       And how great. How great was he in that movie? He was spectrum transition between Michael and the Godfather. I think those guys that do those movies like the Chino and De Niro, Harvey Keitel and all these like historical actors. Um, after a while it just fucking working, you know, so I can till the next really big project comes up till something that comes up. Don't die on us. Don't tell us a little bronchitis, Joan. I ain't no, not bragging. I know. Um, but it's like to keep up that level of work, you know, to keep up the level of work that they did like, like Samuel Jackson and pulp fiction to keep up that level of work. I mean, that's like spectacular goddamn movie. And how do you follow yourself? And that part is so perfect. [inaudible] that's one of the most menacing parts ever. As another menacing, like the, the menacing part of a, of a [inaudible] Cape Fear.

Speaker 2:          00:33:04       Sam Jackson's Menisci part as a hit man who's talking shit to you before she asks you about your cheeseburger that is d to tasty burger. He was fucking horrifying, man. I was [inaudible] about the scene in true romance. There's talking about the w who was in the, uh, you're talking about, we need to talk about Africa. Yeah. Yeah. Gary Oldman is, are we talking about, was it Gary Oldman? Christopher Walker when he was talking about Sicilians. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Dennis. Hi Walker and Dennis Hopper. That was one of the heaviest fucking scenes and but some comedy in it. Hmm. Yeah. Same. A Jackson in pulp fiction was a motherfucker dude. When he would quote the Bible to you before he would shoot you, his wallet said bad motherfucker on it. Jerry curls running around in a suit shooting people. That was a, that was a wild park. Yeah. He's a, he's a good medicine motherfucker.

Speaker 2:          00:34:00       He's got crazy eyes and thanks for doing my podcast anytime my brother appreciate it. Can I do a shameless plug? Yeah, sure. Do you mind? Because he's fucking clubs. This shows so big. Everybody asked me if I can do it, if I can run 30 seconds. Is that okay? What are you talking about? Just mentioned where I'm going to be stuff written down yet because they drive me fucking crazy. It's driving you crazy. Any club that knows I'm going to do this show. All right. I'm doing side splitters and Tampa. Can I do this? Yeah, go ahead. Just does this in Tampa, Knoxville and side splitters, left factory Chicago Long Beach, Vegas, funnybone, Columbus, Denver comedy works, Stress Factory and Kilkenny Ireland. This is all great, but this is Nike. Let me tell you the best way in the future. Just get a Twitter that you do.

Speaker 2:          00:34:49       You post on a regular basis and have all your dates up on Twitter and then send people to your Twitter or send people to your calendar who you're talking to. These people are not going to remember all these things. That's the problem. When you say a bunch of things in a row that loses their meaning. If you say Tom, I rera.net or.com, boom, the size following me on Twitter. How much do you do a on Twitter? Do you, do you get on Twitter all the time? Not all the time, but I do it if I get drunk. You know, there's some profound ball, great way to promote Gig. But yeah, your braid at that shit. Was it all? Yeah. Do you do it before each week? Taj got me into it. He did it. He did a retweet. I went from like four followers to 10,000 because he retweeted me.

Speaker 2:          00:35:32       Read and read it. Yeah. Yeah. Touches. Uh, he's, he's gigantic. Right. And you know what's weird about Twitter and like just being, being around for awhile, Justin Bieber has like 44 million, something like that. And Paul Mccartney has a million. Right. And I know it's different worlds, but isn't that incredible though? It is kind of incredible. It seems like a, I mean I don't think Paul Mccartney is tweeting all the time in the, yeah. Does he use it? Cause Justin Bieber actually uses, yeah. Yeah. That's the big thing with one of those guys. He's always in the laugh factory. You know, he wants to do stand up. What are you putting on? Oh, it's just a story of a Bieber getting his house raided this morning. Oh yeah. Cocaine so far in it. And they're looking forward to he, cause he recently Egged his neighbors house and caused over at 15 to $20,000 worth of damage, allegedly, allegedly.

Speaker 2:          00:36:23       But supposedly there's video allegedly and I guess over $400. It's a, you know, a felony. So they, uh, they're raiding his home, looking for any connections to that. And you know, if they find any drugs on the way, they can just arrest him for anything crazy as they need 10 cop cars to arrest Justin Bieber. Oh Wow. They took him in. Yeah. Yeah. I think what the deal is is like if recently in the news they've been just, he's been just terrorizing his neighborhood. He's been terrorizing. They just got a posse with them, you know, which is hilarious. That would suck if you had some multimillion dollar house and you lived in this really nice place and then you had this crazy fuck living next door to you driving down the street like 50 miles per hour while your daughter's in this draft, that would suck. You think will end up killing himself.

Speaker 2:          00:37:06       Well, if he's doing the coke, it's not a good sign. I ran IRA. No, doing the coke is not, not nobody just like is really good at coke. Like there's some people that are good at surfing. Surfing's hard. If I tried surfing, I'd fall flat on my fucking face. I mean hell, if you get good at surfing, you do it for a while. You learn how to perfect it. No one ever gets that way with coconut in. He said to you a long time ago, Joe, that uh, when you did pot, it changed you and I think it really helped you. I never said that about coke when there was, you know, Tony's doing a lot more coke lately. Usually done his life together. Yeah. A lot of people say that about meth guys do math and all of a sudden they really fucking straighten up.

Speaker 2:          00:37:42       Get the life in order to pull your gums look good. Well that's the problem with labeling a drug is a drug, you know, like saying it's a drug. If it seems like they're all the same thing, you know, they're the, what a drug is, is something that affects your brain. But the vast majority of them are good. Like there's a lot of good drugs. There's a lot of like a to drug. I don't think it affects your friends. A good drug to drug. I mean, you might not like it, but I like a fucking cup of coffee. It's good. You know? Uh, I liked the fact that, uh, you know, there's, there's drugs that could help people that are sick. There's drugs that can help people that are in intense pain. There's drug, there's a lot of drugs that have like some real beneficial effects.

Speaker 2:          00:38:26       And then there's drugs that will ruin your life. There's drugs and nobody survives. There's the, the opiates, the heroin, the math, the, the speeds, the ones where you hear about these terrible stories of people's lives completely fallen apart. You can, I mean, you can kind of include pot in there. I've heard people talk about other people that ruin their life on pause, but that's them inside. That's just the, they're looking for something to ruin their life. I agree. And I'd see that the same way as gambling. You know, uh, the gambling thing. People think that a compulsive gambling is a very different than drug addiction. I don't think it's different at all. No, I think it's all the same. Some somehow or another, you get hooked on a drug. Except this time you're getting a drug from taking a risk. I believe you can have that with sex.

Speaker 2:          00:39:11       Oh sure. With anything. It's masturbation. This guys that have masturbated there, Dick Ra and then like tried to figure out other ways of jerking off. I'm not looking at you in the eyes cause it's you. I'm just saying. Yeah. If everything we, it's weird isn't it? That people get addicted to stuff. The physical addictive part is really weird that we like a chemical attaches itself to our system and then you need that chemical. I guess what they say about Amy Winehouse. They found no drugs in her system and they think that she just quit drinking. And if you are really serious alcoholic and you just cut it off entirely, you can actually die for it and go into convulsions. Wow. I didn't know that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Amy Winehouse, when she died, apparently it was just boobs, you know, and everybody looks at her and you think of her as this, uh, this mess.

Speaker 2:          00:39:59       You know, this, this awful drug addict boozer pill pop in, but really, you know, it was alcohol. Well, I love the drink, you know, it's still drink a lot, but I, uh, I would never wake up and drink. Like that's, that's, I mean, I'm not saying that's a good, I'm not condoning light type of drink and, but man, when you wake up and have a couple of shots, that's a Tirtun, you're not going to last long doing that. That you're, you're really putting your liver into overdrive. Amy Winehouse was talented as fuck though. God Damn, she could sing. She had such a sultry voice. But do you ever hear about people not talented because he, nobody cares. I mean, it's like, look at all the great people that died at 27, like the people from the sixties Joplin shampooing smarts and all three of them died at 27.

Speaker 2:          00:40:47       Yeah, 27 minutes. That was a baby at 27. And it was so stupid. Like it was play basketball. I was in the comedian yet. Well, I think we missed, um, that generation that, that Hendrix and Janice Joplin generation, if you talk to anybody that went through that, they say that the change from the time of their parents was so massive and it was so much different than anything that's cultured ever seen before. It was a revolutionary change and that was all fueled by drugs. All of that. That was marijuana and LSD specifically. That's what was changed and all those people, and that's why they came up with that sweeping psychedelic act in 1970 that made everything illegal. They didn't even have to have like proof bioavailability. Like they made some stuff illegal. That doesn't even affect you. It doesn't even work. It was legal. It was legal before that, right? Yeah. Acid. Mushrooms. I just used to get people at Cary grant used to take acid.

Speaker 2:          00:41:49       Wow, that's heavy. Yeah. Well they say, supposedly according to Mckenna, the federal government, uh, originally came up when they found out about acid, they thought it was going to be a truth serum. They thought that they were going to be ready to give it to the enemy, grab them, hook them up with acid, and then they would tell him all the coordinates for the MTA enemy basis and then they found out it was not a truth. Here I'm, there's no fucking way. This is the truth here. If you ever take it. No. So then they decided that it was going to be something that they would give their soldiers in case they ever got caught. You wouldn't tell the truth, but could you fucking imagine the there you're getting, you're in war. Okay. You're some poor kid. You've been shipped off to Germany, you got a machine gun in your hand.

Speaker 2:          00:42:34       People are shooting at, you know, bullets are whizzing overhead and you get captured. Well, how fucking terrified of you. You're shitting your pants. You're going to die. Oh my God, I'm getting captured by the Nazis. And then you'd take acid like was there ever worst advice ever? I mean, proof positive that the government is not looking out for your best interests. They give you fucking acid to take when you get captured by enemy. Holy Fuck. That's so ridiculous. Well, that was always like a paranoia of mine is getting somebody to put something in. My drink should be. There's a lot of assholes out there. I never leave but drink on the bar. I never, you know, I always tell, especially women don't, don't trust anybody and listened to me with somebody who loves you. You know, I've talked to many people that believe that they were drugged many people.

Speaker 2:          00:43:21       I think that there's a lot of guys out there that do that on a regular basis. It's one of the most disgusting things about men is this thing that you keep hearing about. I mean, I'm sure it happens with women that women do it too, whether to other women or whether the men, but I hear about it with men doing it to women a lot. It's scary that someone would be willing to do that. That there's such a fucking sociopath that d willing to drug someone who wants to be with somebody who's just asleep. I mean, I guess it's a different kind of, they just wanted, I think it's part of it is they know they're doing something evil. Yeah. I think part of it is they know they're getting away with something and they just want to do it. Cause it's a crazy rush.

Speaker 2:          00:43:59       Yeah. You know, I was thinking about that with rape. You know, there was a woman who was raped in the lower east side, uh, like not of her body hang out with this thing. I can't believe I went there. That's not funny. Tom. Stop laughs. Funny Joe. It's horrible. It's quick. But anyway, uh, I was thinking about like, how to fuck these stay hard. I mean, it's gotta be, uh, just anger and violence because it can't be sex or anything because I was like, hey, how are you gonna stay hot when you're hurting somebody? You know, there, there's some people take their clothes off and fucking, it's crazy. Yeah. I think some people just have a horrible view of humanity, of themselves, of other people. You know, that almost all comes down to, if you're willing to do that to somebody else like that, you don't love yourself.

Speaker 2:          00:44:46       You don't love yourself, you haven't been treated with love. It's really that simple, if you will. If you want to hurt someone, scare them and put terror in them, and that somehow or another, it gives you joy or gives you some sort of a rush and you're willing to sacrifice this person's safety and health. You don't understand the connection between human beings like you. You've been raised in a terrible way. Whatever's happened to you along the way is a disaster. It just shows you terrifying aspect of society. How differently can be programmed. Yeah. You could react like that, you know? Oh yeah. I mean, think about all the different variables when it comes to creating a human being. And you know, if you get abused, that's the big one. And people that have been abused and the recidivism rate for people that were, uh, raped themselves, you know, the, the way that they turn to, uh, to violence and violent sexuality, it's, it's really, really common.

Speaker 2:          00:45:35       You know? And then the people that do it, the people that abused kids are abused. Anybody. The real issue with the is they don't seem to get better. Like it's a weird thing. Like they always have that desire. They had this guy on a talk show once and he was talking about it and it was, he was a sex Predator and he was a reform sex predator. You did time and all that jazz and it would just talk about how when the thoughts come up he just fights, fights them back. So he was reformed. Cause a lot of them say that they can't pay reform. Well he says he can't. I mean he's controlling it. Right. But I mean the fact is he's also admitting that he has these feelings all the time. It's a fucked up thing. Like what did it, what is that?

Speaker 2:          00:46:16       I mean we want to hate and we want to judge and you know, it is an awful, awful aspect of humanity but just strictly scientifically like what is that he was molested most likely, right? Yeah. Most likely unless there's something else wrong and the development of the mind, some blood got cut off to the wrong area. I mean, I don't know, I'm guessing, but fuck man, that's a terrible combination. We, we must figure out how to eliminate that if you will eliminate it. If you look at all the, like the, you know, look at the 180 degrees of possibilities of people from really nice people too. Really fucking evil people. The really evil is a small number. If you could just eliminate all the really fucked up shit people do well on a murder and rape. If you could just take away murder and rape, just those two murder, rape and robbery, I can understand murder more than rape.

Speaker 2:          00:47:15       Well, I can understand it. Yeah. And most especially, you know, when you hear about how hot people get just to know a row at a movie theater, you know, guy shots got shoots, a guy for texting, you know, and whatever words were exchanged, but yeah. But if you could eliminate just that small amount, boy would things be different? Man, if you could just figure out a way to not develop rapists, not grow up murderers, not let you know, if we just figured out how to do that. Just those things that none of us have done. Just those things that most of our friends haven't done. Just take those, you know, just those, those are the rare occurrences and eliminate them or drastically reduce them. The whole world would be different. Remember that comedian Vince something? Vince champ or yeah, the one was the rapist and he would go into colleges, colleges, but also the patterns seem to be, he'd go into the music department where it was sound proof the room and when the girl be playing piano, there's some practicing piano and that's, that's what he would do.

Speaker 2:          00:48:11       You know, he had the whole thing down. Oh No. Oh, that's us. His name and Vince Chat. I think it was Vince champ. I don't know. I think that's the name because a on the wall, the Austin club, cap city, they used to have this Vince champ joke. I forget what the joke, really, very distasteful about. Like when he got arrested for rape. There's some joke about it. Yeah, that's a lot. That's a lot. That's a long way from a Dui. Yeah. Well it's also like a really creepy thing at this guy doing, he was doing it over and over again and he was telling them to pray for him. Oh really? Yeah. Yeah. He was, he would rape these girls and tell them to pray for him. Was that the right name? Right ban? It looks like it. Yeah. Yeah. That's my guy. Or Black Guy. Black, black.

Speaker 2:          00:48:59       Like there's all these reports saying like, he was a nice guy. Everyone said it's fairly religious. Fell out. Yeah. And he's still in jail. Oh yeah. He'll be in jail for a while. Yeah. They keep me in jail for a long time. When you're a serial rapist, I mean, how long is he in jail? Right. That down alone with my comedy club, it's gotta be more than 25 years. Right. Convicted of rape, kidnapping and robbery. He stole two. That wasn't enough. And when not just talking jokes, dumb. He probably took like little pieces of things from them or something. That's oftentimes people supposedly do that. Take little pieces of something from you but connects them like as a trophy. Several rapes of the the music, like playing the piano exam. So awful. 19 year old, he was convicted and given life sentences for two assaults in Iowa with time served for could be Harry, he could be released in 2025 he'll be 64 years old.

Speaker 2:          00:50:02       Cute. How his life? 2025 how to do that. Yeah. Life doesn't really mean life anymore. It's like 30 years. His life. Well they're too busy putting people in jail for POCs so there's no fucking room. Yeah, that's dear. What they're doing with the people in Denver, the not letting them use banks. I mean weed is legal there. They're selling weed. They made over a million dollars in the first day and the government says you can't put your money in the bank. Well, what are you going to do? Exactly. Wait, the people that are selling the weed, exactly. The people that are owning these pot shops. So this is the doctors or anything like, like California. There's just no, no, no, this is stores. This is just, damn. Then? Well, it's just like anything else. It's in a store. It's like selling tense or fucking microphone arms, you know, it's whatever he's selling a product.

Speaker 2:          00:50:50       But the fact that this is available for sale and they, they have licenses and they start selling it and retail outlets, outlets. But the government says you can't put your money in the bank. So they run into like some serious danger because you're, you're talking about massive amounts of cash. But they probably had a lot of cash before it was legal. I don't think so. Why would you think so? I mean some people are just people that took a chance and started a business. Yeah. But they didn't pay with credit cards for when they sold pot of the streets. I need dealers, you know? How do you know that they were dealers before this house? I don't, this is the, see this is now that it's legal in the state. This is like a protected business. It's a business. I mean it's a real legal business.

Speaker 2:          00:51:26       They have a license to do it and everything. So it becomes a weird thing when you don't let those people put the money in the bank because you're creating a really dangerous situation. That doesn't make sense. Yeah, it's really dangerous. I never thought the eleague legality of pod made sense and I don't even smoke cause I have no agenda. It's just such a stupid thing as such. I mean, compared to anything else. Well it shows you how the government is not looking out for your best interest. If they're willing to take these people who are doing something that they voted on and they deem lawful and take these people and put them in a weird situation where they can't put their money in a bank, you're being a bully. Like you're being a cunty shitty bully and it's not, it doesn't make sense. Like you're not protecting anybody with this.

Speaker 2:          00:52:07       This is, this is actually putting people in danger. So what do you do? You're not going to arrest them. You're going to agree to the state says it's legal in states rights as you know, as we all agreed on when they formed this silly country states' rights as opposed to take precedent, it's supposed to be the number one thing and then the federal government is only in charge in times of crisis and emergency in war and, but you're supposed to be able to vote on things like in, in your state. The premise, it's like a little spite move. It's a cut move. It's a total cunt move. And it's not just a cut move, it's, it's, it's, it's nerve wracking. It's a, it's like you're forcing these people to, to stockpile money. If they want to be in business, they'd have to take bags of money out of there.

Speaker 2:          00:52:48       Anybody could just rob them at any point in time and you know it and they know it. And so you put them in this situation where they become targets and it's a really sneaky way of being a cunt. Well, you would think that they would want the money to become part of the system because more money, someone's resisting and they think somehow or another as they lose ground over and over and over again, they're going to do this one thing that's going to be good and get, get him back to the victory column, but it's not. There's too much information now. It's not going to work anymore. He can't do it anymore. You can't tell us that we can't do something that's normal and natural. There's nothing wrong with pod. If you tell us we can't put money in the bank because we sell pot, then we tell you what fucking bank, what are you talking about?

Speaker 2:          00:53:27       Who runs this bank? Why? How can you decide what the fuck happens in this bank? Is the government, the bank connected? Like what's going on here? How can you make this decision? But who owns the money? Right? You know, why can't, why can't someone who's legally making it put it in the bank? What are you trying to pull here? Well, you're doing a business move is what you're doing. You're blocking someone out of business. That's what you're doing. What's known as they still got those. They sell pot and shrubbery. So there's there Megan, the money. What do you do? How do you, who dictates which money came from the pilot? I mean you'll have to ever see it. Oh, okay. Dot. Merera I counted to one. Oh Lord is a whip Joe. It's why, you know you can't deduct everything if you deduct too much.

Speaker 2:          00:54:05       The government goes after you just in spite and then they go after your ass. They'll pick up your ass every four years. So like I remember when before they had the claim stuff and I was a valet in Brooklyn, I w we wouldn't make so much fucking money. I had a suitcase full of full of ones. It looked like I rubbed the dollar store. It was the greatest then know. Now waiters and waitresses have to claim everything. But that was a great world in the eighties before the oil changed. They came down hard on them. On tips. Yeah. Do you ever work for tips? Show you um, sort of, I worked at a car wash. You got paid in tips there. All right. A couple of different places. Driver kind of limo driver. Yeah. You got tips as a limo driver, but you know, it's not the big part. It never had a waiter though. No, I never worked as a waiter. I worked as a cook a couple of places. Really? Yeah. Or it does cook it. A Papa Ginos and Massachusetts and a place called Newport creamery. That's gotta be fucking cheeseburgers and Shit. That was a kid in high school. It was good gig.

Speaker 2:          00:55:07       Everyone was fucking everybody. Oh my God. There was these hot girls that worked at Newport creamery and me and a couple other savages guys. And uh, it was, we were all coming into puberty. Everybody was like 16, 17, you know, we were all coming into, I shouldn't even say puberty. We're, we're becoming uh, men, young adults and men and everybody was fucking, everybody. There was like this constant hookup. It was like all this gossip, flip cheeseburgers, getting laid dues. Great. It's all bores. All high school kids. It was a complete, utter orgy. Hell was this, the girl who was the fucking worked at the counter would blow you and, and this and this guy was trying to bang everybody and this guy didn't give a fuck and this girl fuck these three guys one night she got hammered and it was craziness. We know there's a girl at the lift factor. It really wants to fuck you. You, yeah. And I told her, she lives like, she's asking me last night, she knows I talk about this in the air. No, no. Everything's cool. I totally, you're married and happy and loving family. So I said leave him alone. Thank you. Appreciate it. Well you got a damn wolves.

Speaker 2:          00:56:23       I think it'd be

Speaker 1:          00:56:23       way creepy. Or if you were a chick though, if you're a famous check that a bunch of guys wanted to fuck, that would be very unnerving. That shit would be

Speaker 4:          00:56:30       Amy Schumer. Amy Schumer. Yeah. All the comedian. Yeah. We've seen a lot of guys want to fuck her. Oh yeah. Do you want to fuck her? Is that what you're saying? Yeah, I do. It's a weird time for confession. I feel better now. Get it off my mind. My mind. Where'd that come from? All of a sudden you're talking about Amy Schumer. Amy Schumer. What's that? You have walk went off to Amy Schumer. No, I don't do it. I know what I go off to. Individuals groups.

Speaker 7:          00:56:58       Do you have like a wall? Oh, female comedian. Oh, Sarah Silver. Blue Janeane. Garofalo although I like women. Oh, how dare you.

Speaker 4:          00:57:11       How dare you? She's a woman. She the funniest. Let me tell you something. I worked in Montreal for fucking years. I'm one thing. She has his balls and she's a good actress, but I have never seen anybody suck the energy out of a room that you know how a member of the club soda and she is so fucking strong a woman, but she's so fucking with people. She was so bad that they didn't know what to. I saw people like trying to think of something funny that happened to them that day, so maybe they could smile and she died so badly and then I, and she turns to me and it's like almost in slow motion, like a twilight zone. She goes down, did you give me the line? I got to Janine, I don't kill the lights. I'm pissed hosting the show. Whatever you want. Do you want to come off? She goes, no, I'll stay. I'll stay in fucking die for three more minutes. Oh, it was brutal. Anyway,

Speaker 1:          00:57:57       well she's a person that, she's very smart, obviously. She's very opinionated. She was a good radio host. She was on that Air America show. She's just snotty. Fuck. It's the very smart, but she's smart in that, in that intelligence, you can sometimes be like really caught up in it and take yourself super seriously. And then when you do, a lot of times you lose your sense of humor.

Speaker 4:          00:58:17       She was so rude to me. I did mark Merrin's podcast and uh, in Austin and she was on, and she said they were talking about some terrorist thing and I just, I said, oh, that, you know, I named the wrong guy. Right. I was just like, not paying attention. Her and Norton and people, she goes, is he serious? It's easier. Like I wasn't there. He's serious. I just wanting to fucking throttle. And I just was nice. And then when I went on stage with her, I was flying. That's a very Hollywood move of what is he serious? Is he serious?

Speaker 1:          00:58:46       Well, you know, you interrupted, they're really exciting. Talk About Obscure Shit, right? Or political shit or you know, world leaders that they think need to be addressed. Yeah. People get angry if people are not on the same page. You know, I think it's funny when I talked to someone, they don't even know what the fuck Twitter is. I think it's funny. I don't get angry at them. I don't care. Like she don't know Twitter, like really what you know is what you know.

Speaker 4:          00:59:11       I mean, look, I know a lot about sports. You don't follow the NFL like I do, but I would never be like, can appoint Joe. How could you not know that? The only thing I could

Speaker 1:          00:59:19       see it'd be annoying is if you were interrupting.

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       If it was like it was like a really important conversation for them and they thought they were really getting out a good point. And you were crack at some chuck about the wrong guy. No, I didn't do that. I just was asking was that the guy? And then that's when she said it was the guy who was the president of Iran. They were talking about people take themselves really seriously. But I've done that before. I've taken myself too seriously before or getting too caught up in an idea before the point where, uh, you know, think it's more important than just being a person you have. It's part of that Ismet which makes you such a fucking hilarious comedian because your point of view is unobstructed eagle or once you believe in something and that's it. And I like that, just kind of commitment to it, you know what I mean?

Speaker 4:          01:00:03       I mean, when you like the things about the universe and when you get into certain things, I don't know how much you really know, but I feel it's almost like you're preaching, but not in a bad way. Not In a, not in a pedantic way, but just in a way it's like, Holy Shit. I think that's why he has so many fans. Cause you felt fucking strong in your beliefs. Some more people waiver then you. Hmm. Um, maybe, I don't know, man. When we talk about things like the universe or just the realities of this strange dimension that we exist and we have that same thought about we are, we've applied the same thought about the Earth's orbit and we have no control over it. Cause I told you that [inaudible] thing that I have, right? We'll walk onto the beach and be afraid that would be sucked into the atmosphere.

Speaker 4:          01:00:44       And that's fucking where it gets pretty crazy. And like I'd be the first one since the blessing mother that ascended into heaven. You know, you're just laying on the beach. All of a sudden I'm fucking shooting up into the sky. The Sky. That's a weird fear. I know. But I always worked. I always carry anchors with me to the beach. We're so lucky that this is a time where you could go onto just, you know, space.com or any io nine.com there's a million different websites that could show you these crazy videos of the universe and crazy new things every day. I think this would be a shame to not like take part in the wonder of that all because it's all going on right now and he's the revelations that these guys are figuring out on a weekly, monthly and yearly basis are fucking incredible. They just took a photograph of a planet and a star do something million light years away.

Speaker 4:          01:01:39       It's already burned out, but we just got the light from it. Yeah. Is that true? Yeah. And it's already, it's already gone in reality, but it took so long for the light to get here. We just got, it hurts my brain that it's my brain. When you're looking at a star, you're seeing a star that may be already gone. Well, the thing that fucks me up is that there's no end to the universe. Cause I'm used to doing in like the end of the trail, the end of this, the end of a relationship, some kind of fucking and, but there's no end to the immense enormity of space that that blows me away. Well, not only is there no way, I'm a comedian, this is what they're saying now. It doesn't make any sense to me, but they could break. They believe

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       that the universe may be broken down into individual sizes, but then these individual universe is exist in parallel with a bunch of other like infinite number of individual universities. So what they think is that this is impossible for me to even understand, so I shouldn't even be relaying it. But this is as how it's been explained inside every black hole they think is the portal to another universe inside every galaxy as a black hole. So when you look out, you see 100 million galaxies, what you're seeing is 100 million universes and each side each, each galaxy, if you go through the black hole and the cough probably do, and somewhere on that, on those plants. Imagine if Tiffany Haddish was the first person at Queen for no microphone and the university and the whole universe, the whole. If maybe that's what brings the aliens here, we never thought of that.

Speaker 2:          01:03:11       We can do that. And we never thought of that. Not into a mic. At least this is truly groundbreaking, this American art form of stand up comedy. But the so what they're, what they're saying is it's like, it's like a fractal. A fractal is you ever seen like a fractal image? No. A fractal images, a geometric image that as you get closer and closer and smaller and smaller and closer and you realize that the same image repeats itself over and over and over again, infant in an infinitely. Um, one of the more fascinating ones. It's called the Mandelbrot set. Google Mandelbrot set fractal, um, video cause there's a video where they show how it works. It's each, first of all, it looks like a design. Like you just look at it, you look, it's like, okay, it's just some weird design. It looks like, uh, like uh, I dunno like a logo for a cartoon or something like that.

Speaker 2:          01:04:00       Like just some weird design. But then as you get closer and closer to this, design it, it branches out all along. The edges are not smooth around. The edges are in fact the exact same pattern of the, of the Mandelbrot set, the way it looks on the outside. And then as you get closer and you see it again and closer and you see it more, it never ends. It's infinite. Like what do you got there? Mandelbrot set. You see that thing to the right of it? See the thing to the right black one. That's the Mandelbrot set. No, no, no. The one above it. The one above that. The see that one? The black one? Yeah, that's it. The black one. That's the Mandelbrot set. It's a, fractals are fascinating man, because they're able to create these things with computers that you know, didn't exist 50 years ago and I'm actually, I don't even know when they invented fractals, I think it might've been even more recently than 50 years ago, but the idea behind them all is, um, that they're infinite.

Speaker 2:          01:05:02       That as you go deeper into the, the macro, into the micro, you, you see that this pattern repeats itself over and over again. This is the best way to describe it. The fractal is a mathematical set that typically display self similar patterns, which means that they are the same from near as far. Often they have an irregular or fractured appearance, but not always. Fractals may be exactly the same at every scale or as illustrated in figure one. They may be nearly the same at different scales. The definition of fractal goes beyond self similarity anyway, what they think is that the universe is like this. I think that inside every, every black hole is a whole nother universe. Not only is it infinite, but it might even have its own laws and made it have his own physical laws of movement and weight and gravity and light and all those things might be different.

Speaker 2:          01:05:54       It might be off, it might be completely different existence, and then inside those universes are hundreds of billions of galaxies and inside them hundreds of billions of infinite new universes. Why always stick of that when they say, you know, we're searching for a place that has water so that could have life, but how do we know that there can't be different kinds of lives that don't depend on water? It's, it all hurts my head. It all hurts my head and that's why I'm a comedian. Laser just, it really does hurt my head when I, when I start thinking about that each galaxy would actually be infinite. Like they'll say that even though maybe the universe is 15 billion light years across, it's still infinite because even though it, it's impossible to measure a billion light years. Yeah. 15 billion light years. Light travels at 186,000 miles per second billion and 15 billion.

Speaker 2:          01:06:47       I mean that's the idea is that the big bang occurred 14 something billion years ago and from then on it's just been this expansion, the slow expansion to what we are today. To what club are you working on this week? I'm not working. I'll take it. I'm going pig hunting. Are you really the Callan? No, no, no. The Steve Vernella. We're not filming this. We're just going to go shoot some wild boars. Are you serious? I'm totally serious. Wow. You've got this whole ultra, that life man. The, um, I'm very excited about this whole hunting thing. I've become obsessed. He said you should get a Gopro man. I would really like to see like, you know, you can get a GoPro that attaches to your chest or your helmet or whatever rifle. Yeah. The GoPro on the rifle would be the way to go. Right? Yeah. You see the bullet come out.

Speaker 2:          01:07:30       I wonder if you can do that. Where did he go pick honey? They, they, it was a ranch. We're going to a ranch. They put the pigs out there. No, no, no, no. They're wild. They're wild boars. Wow. Yeah. They're uh, they're these crazy looking monster animals. Here are some of the wellbore. Yeah, I've seen, I've seen them. Well, wild boars are one of the few animals that you can hunt all year round because they have to keep the population in the tone check if they don't keep the population in check to the results are disastrous. Like perfect example is they opened up a highway in Texas the night they open it up. There was some insane number, like 40 accidents, car accidents where people hitting base. Really? Yeah. Because they're fucking everywhere. Texas has an insane amount of pigs, insane amount, and they're, they're really out of control to the point where they, uh, they eradicate them through helicopters.

Speaker 2:          01:08:15       They have helicopters that fly over herds and just gun them all down. Oh yeah. It's crazy. Now, do you eat them? Oh yeah. Oh, they're delicious. They're really good. They're really tasty. And they're, you know, of course, depending on what they're eating, if you get pigs that are near people, you're going to get pigs. You know, they might be eating some garbage. They might get ahold of some people, but if you're having pigs that are living out in the wild, there are sort of a, they're omnivores, you know, they'll eat some meat. They'll eat grass is, they'll eat plants like vegetables. They eat a lot of things, but they're super lean and they're, uh, they're fucking mean looking. What does that,

Speaker 8:          01:08:46       uh, this is guy named Caleb that I met in Austin and this is his dogs attacking a wild boar that got on his farm. I believe it was

Speaker 2:          01:08:55       okay. This, I don't want to see his men. I don't want to see this gross. It's crazy. There's a one way they hunt them, man. They use dogs and they sick dogs on him and the dog's hold it in place. Then they come along and cut the pigs throat. When I say they not this, this ranch, and they do that in Hawaii a lot and they do that. And um, uh, Texas a lot. They use a, these dogs, the dogs hold the pig down and they stab them. It's really kind of fucking crazy. I think that a shooting an animal, it's probably the most ethical way to, I mean period of ending an animal's life. If you're gonna eat meat, even if you're buying meat that's in a store, you're dealing with the fact that that animal was a fucking slave and animals just sitting around waiting for its death from the moment it was alive. But if you get an animal in the wild, like you're dealing with something, then it's completely off the grid and then you're stepping into its world for a bit and taking something out of it and eating that and that's going to be your food. Okay.

Speaker 8:          01:09:55       Yeah. With having the pigs are attacking his property as dogs found him on his product. The dogs were just like walking around and then the pig attack the dogs.

Speaker 2:          01:10:03       Yeah, they'll kick your talks until your dog will. They go after a person. They'll kill people if you have them in a pen. You know, that's a real common thing with pigs. By the way, these wild pigs, according to Steve Vanilla, even wild boars, it's essentially the same animal. They can interbreed. They breed back and forth to each other. You know, there's different strains, but they're essentially the same animal. But if you have a, you keep domestic pigs and you fall in when you're feeding them, good luck, Billy. Yeah. They might eat you. They might just bite the fucking shit out of you. And once they bite you and they find out that they can eat you, they're not, they don't care about you. They're going to keep eating. You were going to hold you down and fucking eat and no evidence. Yeah. They'll eat everything and they'll eat.

Speaker 2:          01:10:39       They'll eat your got damn teeth. They'll, you'd everything. They'll smash everything up there. Fucking monsters. Man and they taste delicious. Nothing like Bacon. Well, in the F in the south, they have a lot of the wild boars and the domestic hogs. They like sort of uh, uh, interbreeding and they're making these giant fucking wild pigs. Have you ever seen or heard of Hogzilla okay, pull up the image of Hogzilla. You won't even believe this is a real animal. They're having these pigs that are like the size of cows, like a normal pig. You know, they get pretty big, you know, domestic pigs, they get pretty huge. I mean, I think they can get a thousand pounds easily. Yeah. But these fucking things are ridiculous. Look at the size of that. But that's a perspective one. There's one where it's hanging upside down. That's not the Hogzilla one either.

Speaker 2:          01:11:26       That's a different in different large wild boar. That's it. Holy Shit. Look at that. Okay. That guy is standing right behind that fucking thing. He's not too far away. See, because his foot is parallel to the paw of the pig. So the argument that this is like a perspective shot, I think fades away because that guy is touching that thing that's a big no zero chance. You come across some of them where you go, no, no, no, no. Those are, that's like a deep south thing. That's a Georgia thing. They've, they've had that in uh, I think fucking freaky man. Georgia's where they've gotten the biggest ones. So that's a certain kind of breeding. They breed them. Well, the, the wild pigs and the domestic pigs are breeding. And then sometimes if they get out, they can get really big. I mean, who knows what could be.

Speaker 2:          01:12:13       It could be that, I'm just guessing, but it could be that someone fucked around with genetics. Look at the size of that thing. Jesus fucking Christ Dama rarer. That is a huge, and telling me it's fist to, oh, they're run, they run, they run fast and they're muscular shit, man. Oh, they're notoriously tough. But the flesh is really leading the way. Good for, you mentioned the old g, the guy who got killed by a pig. It's not the first people try not to live. I wouldn't, I wouldn't think people would be laughing. Dom, I don't, what the fuck is wrong with you? So someone lost her life. I can't look at that thing. They it to a pig. Look at that fucking pig to tell me don't think that pig would take you out the pigs running after you Joe. I don't think, I don't know that you, if you knew it had a little bit nimble, nimble him. Well your tongue is very into taking that Xanax.

Speaker 2:          01:13:02       Yeah, pigs are giant. They can get really big, real aggressive and they have um, what is this? It's just mixed in with the pig photos. It makes no sense. Um, anyway. Yeah. So pig hunting. So he goes, I'm doing this weekend. Where are you working? Uh, Tampa side splitters. Sorry about the shameless plug. No worries. An effective, I'll do it again. People racing at a ranch. Are you a camping? I'm doing, I stayed at the hotel. Oh, talking to Joe. Yeah. Yeah. I just did a ranch. She'd be fascinating. Who you going with this guy? Steve Rinella. He's going to be on the podcast Friday. Oh cool. Does he is an expert on this stuff. Yeah. He's a hunter. He has a TV show called the meat eater. That's a check it out. Yeah. It's exciting stuff. What's it on in Discovery? No meat eaters on like the sportsman's network.

Speaker 2:          01:13:56       I think you got so many fucking networks do that. You know they have a military network. Yeah. It's all just people get shooting shit. What was the Hitler network? Well, that's history. There's a, they called it. It will hit. The history is all like shitty reality shows. I moonshiners it's been me and him. The history channel, they showed Hitler more than anything. Do they really? Well, every time I turn it on, yeah. History seems to be more like reality shows now than anything. They're all given up. It's almost like you have to have reality shows on. Yeah. She tried to put Nova on every night and fucking science documentaries. People just go click and asked whatever they want to watch. Some rednecks. Yeah. What's a duck dynasty? Yeah. Have you seen moonshiners and is it good? It's the dumbest one of all time. But yeah, it's the most fake domus one of all time because cops are looking into the car, like they're shooting this from the car.

Speaker 2:          01:14:45       The cops looking into the fucking car. There's a television camera and the cop doesn't bring it up. The cops like a, so where are you off to? What's going on? He's looking into the car at the fucking camera. He's not going, what's the camera? What's going on? What are you doing? No one says, well, we're here shooting a TV show that never comes up. No one ever says we're shooting a TV show. So these cops are lying. Everyone's lying there. All fakers they're just staring at, what if they do another tick? They probably do their fucking selling moonshot. That's illegal. If it was moonshine, they would all be arrested. There would be no show. I mean, what they're saying is that they have these backyard stills, they make moonshot. So I think now with the trying to do is say that it's a, it's all fiction and then everything has been legal and nothing illegal and that they're making, it's only water in those stills and it's all just, you know, but why do they even have wasn't shine when alcohol's legal?

Speaker 2:          01:15:36       Because they want to make their own. They don't want to have to put a tax stamp on it. They want to beat, be able to make it super potent. Oh, you should be able to make moonshine just like you should be able to make beer. You can make it absent. Okay. I think you can get absence and certain um, certain, uh, dosages. We were in Ireland and Mitch Hedberg said to me, you know, he goes, there's Donald, he says, I'm, I'm been sober all day. Go, Oh good for you Mitch. And I love Lynch. And he goes, yeah, cause I want to do absent tonight. No, look and see what it's like from zero to a hundred. So the only reason he was staying sober was to see how fucked up he got on. You know, like furniture, Polish, basically his stuff for Polish, it's like alcohol. Absence is like, have you ever had it?

Speaker 2:          01:16:16       Yeah. Yeah. I've had it a couple of times. It's weird. It's a too strong, it's a weird feeling. It's a, it's like a cousin of drunk. It's like drunks next door neighbor. It's like you don't hallucinate. They're all partying in the same party, but there's a fence between them. No, there's no hallucination. It's just like being drunk. Yeah. It's just a weird drunk tastes way or it's like black licorice ish. Yeah. I'm not so sure. I like it. What'd you did? You took a shot or like a real, oh, I had several. Yeah. No kidding. Yeah, I had it a long time ago in Canada. That was the first time I ever did it. I never see you drunk. Yeah. I'm pretty smart about that. It's not a good thing to do though. I really right with that beautiful car you have. Well Dad, I don't do definitely, but getting drunk period in public. Yeah, we should get drunk. Did you have some night you want to get drunk? Is that what you're saying? I want to smoke. I told you.

Speaker 4:          01:17:10       Well let's do it. Well we should do as book partners. Safe thing

Speaker 2:          01:17:13       drunk on the podcast and you should smoke pot as well. That'll be our next podcast. Sounds good. Well we plan to it right now. You've got two hours. We don't even have a one 30 and dom I rarer is not a man that likes to do things impulsively. It likes to plan things.

Speaker 4:          01:17:33       It looks to schedule. Talking about you last night about what a fucking animal you are like you're just like so like he can't, you shoot pool with Joe for an hour. It's got to be three hours. Everything he does. I said I feel bad for his wife. She's got to be tough. I'm obsessive. It's probably not healthy. You got a lot of energy man. It's, I don't see where it hurts you. You got a great career with the fuck. Great Life. Well yeah

Speaker 2:          01:17:58       I think I'm being obsessive though. Could definitely hurt if it gets out of control. Yeah. It's just a matter of channeling like obsessive, obsessive thinking or the tendency to like follow things down to the ground and chase them down till they're dead.

Speaker 4:          01:18:14       But you've changed Joe, like I told you, you like, you know the thing about Michael Jordan where they go, well he, he didn't beat his mother and Ping Pong and whatever. He has to beat everybody and everything and I think, well, you know, there comes a point where he's going to have, so you know, and not that you were ever an answer because you never wear it, but you were so mad at yourself when we used to shoot pool and stuff and you've lightened up considerably. Well, I realized somewhere along the line

Speaker 2:          01:18:38       way that that is a, that's a very faulty way of thinking and that that's all it is. Yeah. It's like being upset because you did something wrong. Doesn't make the doing something wrong better. And just like outwardly expressing it in fact is indulgent and they're really intelligent thing to do is to accept the fact that there's this shift in the way you feel because you're upset that something went wrong or whatever. But you got to internalize that. And that's part of being a man and being a, a spoiled little boy or a, a brash young cocky boy. You people like fucking get mad and throw things around when when they, when they're upset, you know, if they miss a shot, I mean, I've seen guys in pool tournaments miss a shot, snap their stick on the ground.

Speaker 4:          01:19:23       Well, yeah, I played with this guy, Harland Jamieson, the olds bananas and I don't know if you've ever worked at club and in Poughkeepsie. Yeah. Poughkeepsie. And then that one, and he came back, we'll be shooting pool and he was a pretty good player and he would bang the fucking stick when the claim I was, and I go, Harland, if you keep doing this, I'm out of here. This is like fucking right. And he did nothing against me. But it's just such ridiculous behavior. It's not a man's behavior. It's the child's behavior. I mean, he never did that. You would just get mad at yourself. Yeah, well I would just, I would be, I would know it was always a lack of concentration. I mean, she just shots that you miss where you know, you just didn't hit it right. But there's also shots you miss where, you know, it was a fairly makeable shot, but you took it for granted and you're like fucking idiot. You know, those are angry ones.

Speaker 2:          01:20:08       It wasn't Mrs. It was more of lapses of concentration that I was really upset at myself for. But yeah, the shit doesn't do you any good. No. Now laceless energy. Yeah. Now I just internalized or a try very hard to just internalize, but that's um, that's just a factor of getting older and smarter. Yeah. You hope doesn't happen everybody. Huh? I know that's the saddest thing. When you find dudes that you didn't talk to in a long time and they've regressed, they become more delusional or more complaining. You know, a lot of guys are complaining, talk to me. I'm talking to him in a long time. We talked to him in this, this overwhelming coming.

Speaker 4:          01:20:44       Oh yeah, no, I hear that all the time. I've got a friend who does cruise ships, you know, and he doesn't like it. He's got a family and he does other stuff too, but he's always fucking wine. He says, listen man, you're making me. I said, look, you see this thing? She just car. You see this, you will boy. It was all bought through jokes. You know how fucking hard some people work for nothing. They can't get shit jobs and I'm supposed to feel bad for you because you're going to Turkey. You know that's a hard gig though. Oh, I wouldn't want to do it. The cruise ship said currently. So you're right though. It's definitely better than coal mining. Oh yeah. A lot of people would be super happy to do it. I love when people go. What? You did the hardest thing in the world? No, I don't. But at the guy who discovered these, what were just talking about, what were the mirror things? They, fractals. Fractals. Yeah, I'm fucked us that. What kind of mine. Yeah. Super Smart Science students and no one wants to fuck. That's what's up. Yeah, exactly. When they get more time on her hands, once they start getting pussy throb,

Speaker 2:          01:21:38       they're fucking signs deteriorates drastically. You know, this is all like you have to have no chance that pussy to be sitting in front of a computer banging this out cause there's just some girls out there that would just rob you of all ambition.

Speaker 4:          01:21:52       Whenever I think of uh, no chance of the, I always think of that bit. You had, you know, the one that, the new rules, but I always think of the guys. What was the guy's name? Who she married? He was in his nine j Howard Marshall. Marshall. No chance of pussy unless you're a trillionaire.

Speaker 2:          01:22:10       Uh, 1904. Actually it was when fractals were invented. I was way off. That's fascinating. That's the, the earliest modifications. Yeah. Who the fuck are those guys though? I mean you think about like the things that we use on a daily basis, like computers, all the things we need. I have no idea how any of that works. Not only do we not understand how it works, but even if we did, even if we knew exactly how the operating system works, exactly how the memory is stored, which you could never make that thing, you can never build anything, never invented on your own. I can't make anything. Yeah. But I mean, I'm not even you. I mean, any of us, it's fascinating how much of our society relies on things that almost no one understands. I don't fucking understand plumbing. I don't understand how you can get the same water pressure on the 10th floor as you have on a second floor. It's crazy. It's madness. That's must be a river on a, down the roof.

Speaker 2:          01:23:08       Yeah. Water pressure. Weird. Uh, you ever have, um, uh, like a, a route get into your pipes? No. Never had that happen. I had a route, got into my pipes and grew a fucking tree. All this shit. I mean, when I tell you grew up here right now. Yes. Oh Man. Yes. When I went to Colorado, when I was gone for awhile. The uh, when you flush the water, the uh, apparently like there was these little tiny cracks in the pipe from the toilet, uh, down to the street. That's it. See that thing right there, that was a inside my toilet growing. It looks like a Muskrat, right? Yes. That is, that is a fucking route. Oh my God. That's the root of a tree. So it got through and then because it was all that water in there, it started growing like crazy and, and was searching it cause that's what routes do they, they grow down towards where the water isn't, suck it out.

Speaker 2:          01:24:02       That's how they get moisture out of the ground. So it cracked my pipe open and grew inside of it. That's real. That's not made up that image. I mean if you, if you're listening to this, it looks almost like an animal. Well how do you find that? What's the, is it on a flicker Joe Rogan route pipe? Just like I didn't get blend tech right there. Just Google Joe Rogan route pipe. Yeah. I wouldn't do that because it's filled with poop that was fed by poop and peep and water and that thing grew like a like, hey, we'd like a veritable read dumb. Yeah. I don't understand it either. I've got a new thing recently, um, that it's instant hot water. You know the talk there. Tankless water systems. So your water goes through this thing and it instantly turns hot. It doesn't, you don't have a tank of water just sitting around getting hot.

Speaker 2:          01:24:51       That would be good for my sitz baths. What's amazing is it like safe? You never run out of hot water. That's one thing that's cool. Like you know. Yeah, just got it. So like if someone's using the water and like if you're young, you have a friend that takes a long shower, well you go in after that person and you're fucked. You know you're going to have to take a mediocre ass shower cause there's no hot water left with these things. Now they have it so the water can go through it and it's always hot. People will be coming over to your house to take beds. That's, that's my plan. And my friend that's a, you get them naked. So it's in one place in the house or is it like on every single like faucet there's like, oh no, no, no. It's in one place.

Speaker 2:          01:25:27       It's one, one area where the water comes in and then it regulates it out from that. Oh, it's ridiculous. It's one of the weirdest things ever. It's just like how the weight, what happens? Huh? So the water ends. I mean it's hot as fuck too. It's not like it's kind of hot. It's Kinda hot. No, it's, it's boiling hot all the time right out of the gate. So it's weird. I don't know how the fuck did they get their plumbers put that in or is that like a specialty regular plumbers? Yeah, it's, it's something they put in now. It's normal thing. And you know, a lot of people, especially where we live are going full solar because you can go full solar where you don't even have to be attached to the grid. There's enough sunshine, southern California. We could just have these pretty cool, it's crazy.

Speaker 2:          01:26:06       I had a guy come over last week, my garbage disposal is down. And uh, he recognized me, right. And, uh, now we recognize me. He also gave me coupons. I'm thinking, I guess he recognized me but doesn't think I'm doing too well. And then he said, I got to tell you it's a pleasure to meet him. Mr O'hare o Herro Hara Hara and my name is written on it. I rarer, he just didn't look to, while he's just not good at pronouncing things. Amy, I rera Save Shit. He could be a little black Irish. I had a woman call me mister Irene. Talk about lazy. I'll be up there in the second. Mr Irene Room Service. She made a mistake. Don't get upset. Don't get upset. I like it. And you just turned it into bits. Joe turned into comedy gems and do you ever, oh, come on. What about you?

Speaker 2:          01:26:54       Don't start with me and do you ever, um, and I saw you at the ice house. Yeah. Fucking Billy crystal. That's right. We just said it. Fuck Chris. Talk about throwing that in your memory, but it can splurting it out an hour later. Bobcat, Bob Marley's the nicest guy in the world. Oh Man. Crystal giving him the cold shoulder. How dare you Billy. I know it'd be only knew mustad sounds a little smug. I gotta say that's unfortunate. Yeah. And he's had a beautiful career, man. He's fucking smug. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you know it's fucking, it's a lot of pressure. A lot of pressure on those guys. A lot of times they crack fuck them. They start buying it in their own polo shirt. Yeah. I think that's a, the guys who don't are the guys who keep doing standup because no matter what, no matter how fun you are of how famous you are, or rather when you get on that stage, you have to be fine.

Speaker 2:          01:27:42       They give you a couple of minutes. But you gotta be funny, Joe. I haven't been on stage since the Friday before last the longest in probably 20 years because of being sick. Yeah. Wow. But isn't that true? Like that's how we do it. Like a lot of people folks don't know, like they've never ate five nights a week off or two months out or something like that. It feels really weird. But you come back, it can't be a wiseguy crack wise cracking Italian community and what a hacking cough. It doesn't work, you know? And that's, that's why I couldn't go on. I mean that could have made it, I've been on the stage with fevers and torn muscles and shit, but the cough would be fucking did me in, I only had to cancel one gig ever. Wow. Um, as far as like a weekend, it was a, I think maybe, maybe when I was younger I did, but that I could remember like as a like a Gig that was supposed to fly out to, I took, I think I was supposed to do it.

Speaker 2:          01:28:27       Stress Factory. I'm pretty sure that was what it was. Like any brand. I got the fever flu. Ooh. It was bad. It was, it was one of those ones where it was like on Monday I cancelled. I was like, there is no way. At least he gave them that. Yeah. It was bad. They'll fucking few flu that's going around right now as a mother. Fuck Dude. I've talked to some people that got it that like we're fine and then two days later they're in the hospital on Ivy. Really? Yeah. Holy Shit. They're showing in Houston that people were like, I think they were up to like 50 people have died from the flu. I'm sure it's old people and babies, but uh, well you know, if you fuck up man, that's the thing about like being sick or um, not, not, not having a healthy body, a healthy immune system.

Speaker 2:          01:29:11       Like when you're not healthy all the time, like he's pulling all nighters, getting a couple of hours sleep before you get to work. You're working all day and drinking coffee and your immune system is fucking getting chipped away. If that is when it enters into your life, like you can die, you can die if you, if you're hung over and drawn out and fucked up and then boom, you get hit with the flu. Holy Shit. You can get jacked. I had so many people like bummed me out first day, like act like they care and they know. Oh yeah. You know? As I said, I think I'm getting better. Yeah. He goes, yeah. A friend of mine had done, you know lists like three months or so. Thanks. You know, it's good. Thanks for cheering me up. Just telling me his friends opposed to, that's what I would say.

Speaker 2:          01:29:51       Fuck him friends. Your friends are posting. I'm we be back in two days a smack them three months. The fuck out of here. I'm going to call it last three months. It's not a goal anymore. Yeah, it's an epic Tequila. Asthma does what you have now. Do you have asthma? I got something. This thing is this, this goes so I got to inhale it. You know what's good for asthma? Pussy stank up was a that too, but a wade and my friend made it once and I wish I could smoke right now, but I just don't know what would happen. I've got to drive that panic. Yeah. Yeah. He'd go into a tailspin. We'd have to be like slid out of the corner. Are you allowed to do that with Xanax though? How does that work if you taken Xanax? I don't know cause I never, I mean Xanax is a tranquilizer.

Speaker 2:          01:30:33       Oh you might stop breathing. Xanax feels like Xanex feels like what you would think normal people feel like. No, it's not a high, it's just, I mean I never take it enough to get high, but it's just like a relaxing, you know, just do some indicates what's a cause the downer that we'd like, you know, there's an Oh is it? I'm sorry. There was a article that said that. That's bullshit. I thought that was really interesting. I know it's always, it's pretty established know some article that said that. Uh, I don't know whether they're saying that the people that are selling are full of shit, but they were saying that you, the, the two different highs are indistinguishable. And I was like, man, I don't know about all that bullshit article. Well it seems like you're not getting high enough to really, you'd have to do it and get out.

Speaker 2:          01:31:18       It's like a, Somalia can tell the difference between Lowe's and cabernets. Like right off the bat. Right. They can just tell. I can't tell. I don't know what the fuck the differences. I had no idea there was a pot that was a downer. Well that's what most people think of as for pot. They think of, Oh Gee Kush. They think of like we just chill dog. It really just makes you just really not give a fuck just kicking back and just your eyelids get heavy and then this pot for me at least, that makes me like really think about shit and really get introspective and breakdown my life and life itself. The city and universes

Speaker 4:          01:32:00       and shit like that. That's that to me, whatever it is, whether it's uh, the different cannabinoids are the different strain or whatever the fucking has. There's a different response. I have two different kinds of weed. I thought. I Dunno, I don't, I mean maybe a, maybe I'm wrong about it. Maybe I'm wrong about the, uh, the way the, the mechanism is working. I just know when I get good stuff. Well what fuck me up was, I had no idea that it took a while to hit you. Xanax, no pot. So when I first smoked, this is why I had such a bad experience. I just kept smoking joint after joint, like, you know, in in a half an hour I smoked like, I dunno, three or four joints. There's just like, oh my God, these guys are going, Holy Shit. Look at him. And I'm thinking, and I did this with southern comfort once and I almost died from alcohol poisoning because I just kissing.

Speaker 4:          01:32:47       I was like, I just liked, you know, it's like getting the crowd behind him. Where were you? The Pot? Yeah, I was at the University of Pennsylvania. Uh, I got an apartment down there and Philly and just with a bunch of guys fucking around who's pot wasn't, I dunno, it wasn't mine. And you know, so somebody else brought the pot and then you just started smoking up a storm. But I had never smoked. And the, and then it just kept smoking and this was like really like a lot of smoke, you know? I don't know. Even like, and that's why I think I got so fucked up. Of course it everything like the Breck I was why this was when there were albums now and everywhere. I remember watching the record revolved and just getting lost in that, you know, what was the song that was playing? It was um, tomorrow, never knows it was a Beatles song and turning off your mind, relax and float down the stream, you know, that's all it is, not dying or whatever. And um, and that was real psychedelic kind of song. Anyway, I was like, ah, fuck. I thought maybe my head felt smaller, you know, just everything was weird. That's why I had a bad experience. That's what I want to try it again. And so did you get paranoid? Yeah, very, very bright orange. And what bike do you remember specifically what you thought about?

Speaker 4:          01:33:57       Just that the whole world looked different to me and see the only time I was ever, I had gotten fucked up on cough medicine in high school. Did you ever do that? I did cough medicine when I was an adult. I took Nyquil once when I was sick and it was one of the happiest days of my life. So this was like, I drank a whole bottle of Romel RCF I swear to God. I mean, I, that was, I think that's why, uh, up any kind of upper drugs have had negative effects on me because of that. And then I did the pot and so that's why I never did them. And everyone's against drug. Well, that seems like a very likely scenario. If you smoke that much pot the first time he did it, that is, you're going to freak the fuck out. That's, that's, well, nobody told me, nobody told me they were going wow, look at him. And I was like, Oh yeah, look, one hint. Yeah, that's all you need. Just one. She, that's not even a big one. Not even a big one, just to tiny one. Just to, to really feel what pot does. You want a tiny amount of it. That way you distinguish

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       it from regular consciousness. He fuck around with it, get a feel for it. See the, the, the good and the bad about it. And occasionally going to push it. Occasionally going to get too small. You're Gunsmoke two hits and three hits. They ain't going to feel weird as fuck and you gotta go, you know me better back this down. So we back this down, take it down to one again, bring it down to one and just try one for awhile. But when people start smoking a whole joint or two g your code, that's like he had never ridden a motorcycle before and you get on one of those Ninja, you know, just go ahead and done it. You know what? You can't do it. But those guys who do it every day can do it. It's a similar thing in a way because it's the experience of being really, really high is manageable.

Speaker 2:          01:35:40       Say if you're a guy like Everlast, you know, if you get high all the time and you're just naturally cool, dude, that can deal with shit. But if you're a guy who's never gotten high before, like that can fucking be marble. Terrifying. It was terrifying. What were you thinking about when you said the world? It just didn't look the same. Uh, just the proportions of things look different, you know, like as if I was zipping, my eyes were different lenses that they changed, you know, for a while. And you know, I was just getting a thought in my head that like giving them the song. W We keep playing in my head when it was over. You know why it was pretty heavy. I mean, I guess it was close to a trip, you know? Wow. Yeah, that sounds like what I go through every night.

Speaker 2:          01:36:27       Like a typical day. I went through the end of the tank last night. He went to what? I went through that in the tank. Could you do the tank? Yeah. Yeah. I've Joe, you're unbelievable. You're so funny. You got so many fucking varied interest in all. I watch sports center lists. No, that's what I did. But that's, we're all different. Dot. Merera I'm just trying to maintain and not go off the rails into crazy town. So what do I do? I hunt bores and aligned saltwater. Typical. I'd throw kettle bells around just trying to keep it together. You got to fight this week? No, this week is no UFC. This week I said I'm going for hunting. The next UFC is not until the week after that and Chicago, I'll tell you. Thanks again for the Montreal tree. Did you enjoy it more than enjoy the Tammy pass could tell you another would have fucking, I mean that guy like the excitement.

Speaker 2:          01:37:15       I could just imagine like it's like the gladiators, the Roman Empire. Like the excitement in that room when the French Canadian guy walked in. George Saint Pierre. Yeah. Oh my God. And then the fight itself and it was, it was great. Yeah. Those live events or there's something special like seeing, seeing the UFC live is this very few things that have as much electricity in the air. So much potential drama and while the fights are going on, there's so exciting. It's so exciting. And I, you know, you, you invited me to a couple of them and I was so amazed at how clear I see the crowd is. It ain't like professional wrestling crowd skate on his face.

Speaker 2:          01:37:53       I mean, they're like really nice people. They look, but they're not well, I always hoped that it would go closer and closer towards the ethics of martial arts because I think that if you looked at the best guys ever, the best UFC fighters are martial artists from hoists. Gracie, the original, you know, to look at like Leo Machida or Anderson Silva or George Saint Pierre Silver broke his leg. Anderson brogues lag. Yeah. The last fight. These guys are martial artists like the Anderson bows for every match. Liotta Machida bows, George bows like they are, they're literally upholding the original codes of martial arts conduct. I mean, they are martial artists and those are the best guides. It's not these brawler fuck you spit in your face kicking the balls, guys. Those guys are not the, the, the champions. The champions adhere to this sort of philosophy and principle of, of excellence that I think, yeah, it kind of have to have, and the people that are attracted to that, there's going to be a bunch of knuckleheads in the audience.

Speaker 2:          01:38:56       I mean, it's unavoidable. You get 18,000 people, you're going to get a few dozen crazy people for sure. There's no way around in any game baseball, you know? But overall I think that what the fighters project that they project a level of respect and a level of discipline and dignity that a, the audience, they, I think they take that in. I think they appreciate it. Whereas when you're watching the WWE, you'd know that it's scripted. It's a wild, crazy event and it's fun and it's entertaining and it's acrobatics. And you know, those guys like they were in the rock is a serious athlete. Brock Lesner, he's a serious athlete. Brock Lesnar was pretty successful in the UFC for a guy that didn't have any of MMA fights to speak of other than one before. He entered into the biggest stage on earth as a fighter. I mean, he's a ballsy motherfucker, you know?

Speaker 2:          01:39:44       So no disrespect to the wrestlers or anything like that, but one of the reasons why the audience will act like that, it's because they could feel it. It's not real. It's all horse shit. They're just there. They're like trying to suck excitement out of, out of the air. But don't you think there's certain people that believe it's real no matter what you tell them? 100%. I talked to a guy from a Abu Dhabi who was telling me that his friend absolutely believes that it's real and he cannot argue with him about this. Not so frustrated. He didn't know what to say. My doctor thinks all professional football is rigged. Really? I go, how the fuck can they get to all these guys? This is, I'm listening. He goes, you're going to tell me that, you know, Brady couldn't throw a pass. And I go, I don't know.

Speaker 2:          01:40:23       But how do they get to the center? How did they get, you know, it's the company becomes a point where it's just paranoia. Some people don't like the wool pulled out over them, you know, pulled over their eyes. So they, uh, they like to look for it and everything. Uh, these motherfuckers are all in together. Yeah. Right after you fcs all the time. I'll get tweets like, yeah, you know, it's a fuckin fixed fight. That was a bullshit. Fuck that flex fixed and you know it. Oh, fights can be fixed. I mean, they certainly can. Fights can be fixed basketball games with ribs or a guy who missed his foul shots at the, you know, but

Speaker 4:          01:40:54       when you get to a whole fucking football team, it's 22 guys plus Reps. I mean, come on. Well, the thing about basketball is you, uh, I mean they have absolutely proven that referees have been involved. Oh yeah. They've, they've, they've proven that they've shaved points. Yeah. They've proven that people have done, there's a guy who just got out of jail for that. Yeah. The referee. Right? Yeah. And I had a friend who, um, who was a rough day, but they did this. I thought it was so classless. They would get first class tickets and sell them back, getting checks cashed them in and get coached tickets and pocket the money. That's, that's kind of fucking low life sleazy. Yeah. That's, you know, it's not living your life either. What do you get sit in first class? Fuck it. I know you didn't have the ticket before, but I think you should be allowed to do it.

Speaker 4:          01:41:40       I don't see a problem with it. I feel like, uh, if you're the one who, uh, wants to sit in coach and you want to, we'd rather have the money. I feel like you should be able to do that. I just think it's a lack of class, so it's a little sleazy, but no, you know what, I take that back. I don't even think it's a little sleazy. It's like some people like to take it on board with you. Joe Rogan. I rare they, some people don't mind coach. What if he's a little tiny guy and it'll gets a window seat and he just kind of curl up? I mind coach. You do. You do. Oh, I don't see, so that's for you. It drives you crazy. If he can't go back there anymore, I can't do it. It's the only thing about it. I just don't give a fuck.

Speaker 4:          01:42:16       I always fly for, I paid more for my ticket to Australia then I made, I did. I did. I worked two weeks. I made less money. Just didn't give a fuck. I wonder to fly First Class Dad. So Alaria s that's hilarious. That is a total dom. I rare or move, oh my age, it gets such a kick out of it. Oh, that's so funny. Well that's, but again, I hate to say this, but that it really is why you're so funny still. It's like there's a, you know, we were just talking about it the other day, me and Tripoli, we're talking about how a lot of comics that we liked back when we started, you know, they kind of sort of drift away from it. You know, like even the greats. Like look at Steve Martin. He doesn't do stand up. Stopped a long time ago.

Speaker 4:          01:43:00       You know, Robin Williams, like we'll occasionally do stand up, you know, but you think about the people that you really admired back then. It's not that many of them that I like really active still, but the ones that are like, a lot of times they change radically. Like their acts change. They, they kind of drift away from whatever it was that made them good. They just sort of get this weird sense of complacency or something like that. I don't know what happened. And also you, they, they run out of juice. You know? And when I'm not, to me, I consider myself the oldest young comedian. I don't even mean I really don't feel old. I feel young. I feel, and I'm lucky that I hang out with guys a lot younger than me. I, I absorbed that and energy, you know what I mean? You know, you included. I mean, it's just the, uh, I, I love being around that and cause I find that not to put my generation down, but a lot of them are fucking bitter and bitterness goes nowhere. Yeah, exactly. So

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       it's just like, like the unnecessary anger yelling out and smacking your stick on the ground. Yes, exactly. Realize it for what is it that makes you bitter? You're unhappy with your success will do something about it, you know? I mean, barring your physical health and unforeseen circumstances that can't be controlled, most people have a little leeway room to, for improvement. And the bitterness is not fucking helping yet. Just this fucking guy. You told me this guy deserves a sitcom. I tell you, this guy, I middled for him in Cincinnati. Do not follow me.

Speaker 4:          01:44:22       Pat Cooper. Yeah. Yeah. He, and he was thinking, you know, I liked the guy, but he's, you know, he's really angry. He's telling me he's trying to, he's thinking I'm too stupid to realize what he's doing. He's gone. He's fucking kids today. These cocksuckers they got five minutes. They got a sitcom. I've been around 40 years. But you're a good kid. I mean, he throw it like that. That's supposed to keep Pique my interest and I don't have a fucking Citco like, oh, well maybe I should tell you something. Maybe you're not right. That guy was an interesting guy. Is he still around? Yeah, I mean, I can't hear anymore, so it's kinda tough. Oh, that sucks. He used to go on stern and rant and rave, go fucking crazy and yell at people and it's just like, oh my God. Like, listen to them get wound up.

Speaker 4:          01:45:03       But this, there's an element of sadness in it, you know? Yeah. It's an element of a burns. A lot of bridges. Some of those guys, he got mad at the Sopranos, you know, getting any of you. But what did he get mad as a promise for? I don't know. They didn't give him big enough parts or some shit and they didn't get, you know, whatever it was. It's like, you know what I mean? I love that rite of passage for Italians that we were all supposed to be in the sopranos. What the fuck? They only got, they got a cast of 20 people. There's a lot more Italians, you know? Well, I think there's a lot of people in that show that also had not really done a lot of acting before. Like Stevie van Zandt, Little Steve and Bruce Springsteen and our friend. I mean our buddy. But it was Joe. It was, they were, they, they had a core of real actors and they had types and some of the types like Steve developed into real good actors, you know? But I mean, that's what the show was. It was the core of 80 Falco and you came to Defini and Michael Imperioli periodically, those guys. And then they, I, that's the way they cast it.

Speaker 2:          01:46:01       Yeah. But I think what the appeal was, one of the appeals was that these people that were in these peripheral roles that really shined and benefited from it greatly. Our, like our friend Steve Sherpa, Steve was not like an experience actor. He was booking the Riviera when we met him. He's a great guy. I fucking love that guy. But he went from doing that to being a really successful actor, boom like that, but a hard worker too. He and capitalized on it and he, you know, he's smart. Steve's are very smart guy. So, but my point is that other people saw that and go, look, this fucking guy, he was over. He wasn't even jealous of me, so it wasn't blown. We're told me I could do such a much better detailed job with that role, that role. I was cool. It sounded like a little bit of Quincy Italian and I was having twins.

Speaker 2:          01:46:52       You lift your finger prints that it sounded like dice. Oh, I'm morphing. I'm a bunch of fucking characters over the top. Oh, speaking of dice, I saw blue jasmine. Did you see blue jasmine, woody Allen. Woody Allen Fascinates me, man. Oh yeah. He's fucking fascinating. He's the reason I got in the though. Really? Yeah. When I was a little kid. Um, he's, he makes a new movie, like basically every year, you know, and they're going to blue. He writes them all himself and they're fucking good. This blue jasmine was a good movie. Um, he's one of the guys. I mean, I think he's a creeper for sure. I mean, that whole thing with, yeah. Daughter was just in, I don't, I don't want to judge. I'm trying to be a nice guy, but I don't think he looked at her as a daughter. I don't know what happened.

Speaker 2:          01:47:36       Whatever, whatever. I'd have no idea. You know what? You got to got to admire him for, she's not even hot, so you can't see, I can't say he left his wife for a hot young chick. She's fucking holier than his way. Oh, I guess. But she's young. It's different. Um, anyway, you just try to help them be, yeah. What was I saying? So his movie, so I saw, this is how I got to my woody Allen resurgence. I saw at midnight in Paris. Did you see that one? Yeah, it's fucking good. It's a good movie. So it's interesting. Yeah. You know what you got to see though some of the love and death checking out because it, the fucking jokes are hilarious. I think I have seen it. I think that the French revolution, the Russian French war, I don't remember what it was about. I saw it a long time ago. I saw a sleeper. I saw, um, uh, Annie Hall. I seen a lot of his little or your gas metronic in love and death. A Napoleon says to Diane Keaton, he goes, how do you think of me as a man? She goes, I think at your best,

Speaker 9:          01:48:34       but these kinds of jokes.

Speaker 2:          01:48:39       Oh, what a great line. A line after line moving none other ones. Your best bet. It's been a minute. It goes, uh, you have beautiful skin. She goes, yes. And it covers my entire body.

Speaker 2:          01:48:55       Well, a midnight in Paris was really good. And what's interesting about it is that Owen Wilson plays woody Allen. Oh Wow. Woody Allen can't play Woody Helen. Yeah. He used to get the show on Wilson. Exactly how he's doing. Well, he's not going new Yorkie. He's going all the way Brooklyn, but he's basically that guy, this nebbishy hotkeys. His wife is fucking around on him. It's always in, in woody Allen's movies, someone always is having an affair right under somebody's nose and it's chaos and you find out, well you, you were fucking this guy. Right. In the other world, I mean, get over it. It's not that big a deal like that. The way that people behave, almost like as if he wishes that that would be how people would behave at all sexual indiscretions. Right. It's almost like he's flavoring the world with a this diet. Get them off the hook.

Speaker 2:          01:49:44       What's it? Yeah, because it's a very unnatural, like the, the anger and reaction is people have, it's like everything is real. Except when it comes to like real emotions dealing with loss or infidelity, like then it becomes like, well, get over it. I was right. Dare you. You had to know. I didn't know, you know. Okay, Harry, I was cheating. You know? It's like one of those things and the guy's like, I can't believe this, and he leaves, but it's so unrealistic. It's like everybody's like, whatever, get over it. But in blue, jasmine is another one that the, the uh, Alec Baldwin Character, I don't want to give a spoiler alert, but the reason why I brought it up is dice is really good in it. He's really good. He plays this given to her. It was really short. I like them short reason why he didn't probably get any awards because it was probably, oh his, his thing was your movie was too short. No, no. His, his role. He should've had a bigger part in it. No, no, I think it was perfect. I mean, it was a complex sort of a role. It was, it was believable. There was a lot of, there was a lot of good acting in that goddamn movie. Cate Blanchett, the one woman who's the lead is fucking sensational.

Speaker 4:          01:50:45       You Know Sean Penn? Yes. Yeah. When he said to me one night were at the Improv and he just got a great memory for comedy. He said he remembered on all bitten and he started telling me about it and I go, all right, if we're going to talk about comedy, you gotta tell me what it was like to work with Woody Allen. He said, I'm glad you asked me that. He gave me one note, the whole film. I said, what was it? He goes, that last scene you did. Uh, nothing was right. That was done. That's the only fucking note. He had only direct nothing. Nothing in that scene was right. Wow. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:51:15       Well, he's a master filmmaker. He's just a weird guy. He's him. He's a genius. Master filmmaker. Does blue jasmine movies fucking really good? I'd have to say he's the best writer. And then Larry David for comedy in my, in my opinion, you know, you mean like joke writing or comedy writing, right. Just common. Imovie and I, Larry, obviously

Speaker 4:          01:51:36       it has not made the graduation to to film. Like what are you, what he did, he shouldn't.

Speaker 2:          01:51:41       His stuff is so good. And curb your enthusiasm. Just don't fuck with it and leave it right there so that, that, that let them do whatever the fuck he's doing. Let them make that exactly how he's making it. Don't touch it. I watch

Speaker 4:          01:51:51       a Seinfeld episode last night that with the man's ear, the bra for men, the Bro and I had a prostate exam and I, when I, when I was going to pee next, it was going to be blood. Right, right. It was really fucking like I was, it was really like fucking horrible. I was like lightheaded and Shit and Jerry was on the phone telling me about the fun about this episode before it happened and we were fucking crying, laughing. Just the idea of Jerry Stiller's tits made us laugh for fucking five minutes. What is this? I'm confused. What else do you, pink blood. Oh, because I didn't see, I didn't want to laugh. Oh, I'm saying I didn't explain it right. I didn't want to laugh. I come back from the hospital, I'm in this bed, man, Moon, fucking lightheaded or all Pale and shit. And we started talking and he starts telling me about this fucking, anyway, I just reminded me of it because I saw the episode last night and it's so fucking brilliant. You know the he, yeah, he

Speaker 2:          01:52:46       like everybody loves Raymond, which was like a really standard, like good quality sitcom. They had an eight plot, basically maybe a B plot. Seinfeld had a, B, c, d, You know what I mean? Just ridiculous. Like Craig Kramer hits a golf ball and it goes into the whales, the blowhole and you know, they're like, you know what I mean? Like everything is connected and how he did it was fascinating. 22 minutes and clean and Larry David's genius, but his best work is curby enthusiasm in my opinion. It's Seinfeld is really good, but curby enthusiasm and takes it to the one where he had the water bottle in his pants and he, and I didn't want to tell the whole story. Hooker Carpool came and tell you the stories that we know that came out of Lowry spoiled him that came out of Larry. I'm not getting enough credit for Seinfeld.

Speaker 2:          01:53:29       I really believe that because everybody would get credit. George got credit for playing him and you know, can Jason Alexander, he's a terrific actor, but he was so much in the background. He thought, fuck this, I'm doing a show and he had the power to do it. You know, he put up his own money for that. Jason Alexander is a weird one because nothing's really clicked for him since doing that shit. Who's so fucking good too. He was so good on that show and now he's taken to wearing a hairpiece. I know. And you know I saw the one last night where where he wore a hairpiece on a show. It's a joke as a joke and now he's wearing one in real life. It's a what's like, I dunno what, unless you're going to do it like Carl Reiner did where you just take it off sometime and where I'm trying, I think it's funny cause they going to try to fool anybody.

Speaker 2:          01:54:10       He's not trying to fool anybody. You can't because everybody knows that he was already bald, and I think he just likes the way it looks better, which good for him. But why you worrying so much about what you look like? It's a little weird. I said, just wear a hat. I don't wear anything. It's not like it affects his performance in some way. Like if growing your hair made you smarter somehow. Like imagine if like hair was like muscles. Like the bigger your muscles get stronger, you get the longer hair gets smarter, you get, well, I could get wanting to have more hair and if you could wear a toupee that would make you smart. It might've given the people were that were that simple that you just had to fiber optic to pay and you put on it would mimic the effects of having a full head of hair as far as your intelligence goes or grow it even further when you remember what goes on with the ego.

Speaker 2:          01:54:52       Who these guys, you know, and Jay Jason was, I remember being on that set and he was upset because he never wanted an Emmy. Oh God. He won grammy awards. Dude, I was on a set of news radio wants and everybody was complaining. It was dark. It was like everybody was bummed out because our ratings were down and there was, you know, it was like, God, we can't get on Thursday night, but this show goes on right before friends or right after friends and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And I remember thinking like, we're on a sitcom. Oh yeah. Oh lucky you are to be on a sitcom. And it's a really funny one. And we're not appreciating it as it's happening. Right as it's going on. We're wishing we were number one instead of whatever the fuck we were. We weren't doing well like news radio never did well.

Speaker 2:          01:55:37       It didn't do really well until it was syndicated. They didn't know how to use you at all. News radio did. Oh, I, some great parts. I think they could have used you more. Oh, that's very nice to you. But that's just cause you love me. I think they use me the perfect amount and we consider the fact that we have so many characters. Andy, Dick, Vicky Lewis, Steven Root, candy Alexander, Phil Hartman, Dave Foley, Maura Tierney, me the fucking shit. Yeah, that's a lot. It was an eight person castle, a lot of fucking people at 22 minute show and you're bouncing everything back and forth and you got two, well three monsters on the cast. You got Phil Hartman who's a monster day, Foley, a monster, and Andy Dick was a monster. So those were like the go to guys for like carrying scenes and big moments and you know, I would come in with something wacky on occasion, some wacky thing that I would do.

Speaker 2:          01:56:25       I thought they were great about divvying it up. The one who got the slight, and my opinion is candy Alexander, the black truck that was on the show. She's a bad ass actress, man. That girl is a powerful, strong actress and I just don't think they ever really, totally got her. I don't think she had enough roles where it was like, but you know a bunch of white dudes from Harvard. Right. So sexy blast, we'll show you did right before the hardball or a piece of Shit. Yeah, that was cool. You got it right away. I got lucky, that's for sure. The two things that were the luckiest that I ever got was uh, getting hardball and from getting hardboiled, getting news radio, you know, the fear factor thing was a more of a response to not wanting to be in the acting world anymore.

Speaker 2:          01:57:12       You know, when I took fear factor for the money a but also be because I knew it wasn't, I didn't, I wouldn't have to deal with actors. I wasn't going to have to deal with scripts and the creative aspect of bad comedy because you go from a show like news radio, which is a really good show. Try finding another really good show. Good luck. Oh, I know. I've been on them and I read from something they would just, it was painful. They were bad. It just clumsy and clunky. Joey got fired from a show that was written for me. I couldn't play. And the guy that was so fun and you know, it was so happy when it went down in flames because it was so bad. They hired like this real actors guy. Dan had day and he couldn't make it work and it's just a day.

Speaker 2:          01:57:51       And why do I know that name? He was the father and clueless. It was sheriff's father and includes. Wow. But uh, would you do another sitcom? Yeah, definitely. If Paul Simms was going to do another Sitcom, the guy who made news radio is you wanting to do it. I almost did another one at his. I'd love to work with you man. I did a pilot of a show called um, overseas. It was a pilot. I played like some guy that was on some other country for some strange reason I got stuck over there. So, but uh, he's just a brilliant guy. It's just such an out of the box guy. I know there's other out of the box guys out there, you know to think the guy who, uh, what's his name? Dan Harmon, the guy who makes community, like everybody's saying the community, it's just like a hundred times better than seats. And now that he's back, he's back and chase. He's gone. Yeah, he Chevy chase. Yeah, that was the other thing. Um, he's a happy go. Lucky Guy, Huh? Yeah, it doesn't seem to, Huh? What's the guy's name? Um,

Speaker 4:          01:58:42       the, the soup, uh, Joel Mchale, sorry. Great Guy Too. By the way. I feel like a Dick for not remembering your name, but I blame the weed. Uh, Joel Mchale was on Opie and Anthony and he was talking about Chevy chase that he just really didn't want to be there. How do you get insulted that your own roast, you get insulted their rose. It's a roast. You have, they're going to say things. It's supposed to hurt your feelings. Exactly. That's why you don't get a roast. Do you gotta do organize around? So I liked them. I liked them when I did them and I did, um, in the, uh, with those, like the real old guy, I was like the young kid and it was Milton Berle and all those guys in the 80s. And I liked them because they were like the real originators of the roast. Now how, how much can you talk about how big Cloris Leachman is?

Speaker 4:          01:59:24       Kindness, you know what I mean? It's like how far is it? Is that come out? Is that like a big part of roasts and now for the mandatory and how big is Cloris? Leachman? Actually it came up about fucking 20 times when I went to see, um, uh, Pamela Anderson Roast it. I think it was, uh, or no, maybe it was her sag. I forget. I always get those two mixed up. And uh, they just relentlessly did the same fucking joke. You could drive a car into Pamela Anderson's Conn and this is that, you know, it was like, oh, this is so not true. I've seen that video. Tommy leave video. Yeah. You couldn't, tiny little thing. Yeah, they got all kind of cars. Are you driving? I can't jerk off to a video like that. No. No, not like too big. Well, no, just a married couple that I don't want to, I ain't want to see people that are, you know, like out of this world.

Speaker 4:          02:00:12       Not Real, real people. Like our prostitute friend. I haven't been with a prostitute and wow, how long? Couple of days. But uh, what time is it? No, I, I took blood pressure medication about two years ago and it made me, like we were saying, made me less Italian, a more Irish. Do you think that you would ever be into doing something to radically change your health? Like if someone, if you took on like someone who told you what to eat, gay worked you out every day, put you through the paces and got your body into a better shape, better condition and actually, can I get in better shape? It's almost impossible. I mean you're at the top like an Olympic. We're going to like, we can wiki all the shit out wall. Go fine. Tune it, fine tune it a little bit, a bit. Know where I am.

Speaker 4:          02:00:58       I'm totally fucking pleased with, I love having a gut because I got something to rest my hands on when I'm thinking you have my favorite, my favorite line ever when it comes to being gay, being in the closet, you'd go, I wish I was in the closet just so I could come out. That's how little I give a fuck. That was just a line for the show. I know we did that on stage, said I wish I was gay just so I could come out of the closet. Some exciting look at Todd glass. He got more press on that fucking hell and it made her career. Well, I'll tell you what, when Todd glass came on the podcast, he real I, that is the first time I had talked to him in person since uh, he came out and I guess you're supposed to say he seems so relieved

Speaker 2:          02:01:40       and he was so relieved that he could come on the Sean beat got barbecued who was so relieved that we could all do that together and the giggling and silly and he wouldn't have to worry about feeling like he's being attacked whether he was hiding something. That's a big thing for those guys, man. Or for those girls or anybody who is hiding something like that, you know? No one should care, man. No one should care. You should be able to tell people that you're into dressing like a girl should be able to tell the people that you like to fuck. I should be able to tell me whatever the fuck it is. Ugly your fucking girl and you were on you. Me, I fucking jaw. You would be a little bit uglier than me. It's a little bit, a little bit more confused me a little bit.

Speaker 2:          02:02:17       How to check the mail too. I like to think of a judge. If I was going to go to uh, a girl to get a hand job, I might go to you. Ah, but soft hair I would think. Yeah. Soft hands. And there's a lot of like, I'm not blowing anybody though. That's where I draw the line. Even if I was a cow. But if I think the blonde somewhere, that condom, it's just like fucking shaking their hand through a window, you know, come on. What's going on there? You know, you need to put your hand on the glass. You're not really shaking hands. Yeah. Someone just going up and down on your Dick when there's a condom on it. Like, what is that weird barrier between you and pleasure? And we need that because people have diseases in their mouths and their decks were gross.

Speaker 2:          02:03:01       People are gross or fucking gross diseases. There was this hooker, she's a porn. I love the porn star fucking theory like everybody takes, but they never say, they say just he's a working actor. I know what I'm saying is that he's a star. He's not as starting the, anyway, she came up, she came up to me at the comedy store, gave me a hug. She goes, then she Facebook being, but my ex wife does my Facebook and she wrote that to tell you that he did sound okay. Uh, she, she came after me. She says she would when she went to the exchange sexual favors for comedy wisdom and my wife's and said, you know, she goes, who is my ex wife? She goes, who is this fucking nut? I just ripped it up and throw it out because she's sounding like a whore. I go, but that's the good thing.

Speaker 2:          02:03:44       Right. Anyway, she doesn't know you very well know. Anyway, she did get in touch with me and, but you know what? She was so fucking annoying about comedy. It turned me off. Really? Yeah, because she wanted way more comedy that I wanted. Anything from her. Well, when someone that I saw in a lesbian video, when someone wants to learn how to do comedy there, you know there's a few things you could tell him, but there's very few. It's the real thing that they need to do is go on stage, go onstage a lot and then chop it down yourself. Minimize the amount of words you use, maximize the impact of those words, figure those things out and fake. Find out what it is. It's funny and unique about you. Listen to yourself because a few things you could tell. Some of them when they want to go over individual bits with you, they basically want you to write their act.

Speaker 2:          02:04:29       And that happens to a lot of boyfriends. I mean that's a, it's, it's a joke that I've heard used on several different comedians that are female that wind up dating men that are also comedians and then start writing their acts. I mean, we know guys who have done it. It happens all the fucking time. And you know, that's not as fun. That's, that's weird. That's a weird, but it's seat. But then this case is like Thompson Jura and Christina Palicki where I'm sure they go over bits with each other, but they go over bits as peers. You know what I'm saying? Like Tom's not rewriting her act. She's not rewriting Thom Zak. They're both holds for, yeah. Yes. But that's ideal. You know, like, that's why I love when something like that happens because people always like to use that, uh, that thing. Like that's standby cliche that two comedians can never be husband and wife and be happy to people that are, you know, in the same position, the same sort of occupation.

Speaker 2:          02:05:22       They would just wind up fighting each other. Tom and Christina get along great and they're both fucking great. They're both really funny people. They're like, you see them together, the laughing together and they're always laughing with each other and like they enjoy each other's company and they're both really good. It's so rare when you see something like that. It's so awesome. I think that's the aberration. I don't think it's normal, but it's possible. It's possible. It's totally possible. That's what I like. I liked that it's possible. That ruined my marriage. Yeah, the competition. Yeah, because like I was getting hired for Saturday night live like in 1980 and I got like three episodes. It's a long story. It's not even worth it. Sound like Brian Calendar right now. I'll do it real big deal. I was just like the greatest comedian of all time. No, no, I didn't mean it like this.

Speaker 2:          02:06:05       I just put the story was to let, the story was actually too long, but anyway, she would come. I'm not on the fucking show and I'd come home. She goes, did you mention me to them? Like, oh, I'm not. I said, mentioned you. I don't even have a fucking voice. I don't even have an agent. You know? So that was, that really kind of ruined a lot of things. Yeah, that's rough. Oh, did you mention me? I had a friend who got apart and his girlfriend started crying immediately and it's like, when is something going to happen for me? Oh No. It was a, it was so, it was so uncomfortable to be around. Yeah, that's, it was, she was doing it like in front of me and I was like, okay. Uh, she was crying in front of you. Oh yeah. Yeah. He, he, he goes, guess what?

Speaker 2:          02:06:41       I got the part. Oh. And she starts crying. Like, when is something going to happen to me? I think for some people they're just not cut out for the pressure of, of like trying to audition and go after things. Like one of the things that people point out is I'll crazy actresses are, and actors are, but I think one of the reasons why they're so crazy, it's not just that they came here crazy, but that the process itself is so terrifying and mind numbing and obsessive because it's so difficult to get cast in something so difficult when you competing against thousands of other people on a daily basis for a limited amount of roles and every, and you're, you know, you're barely getting by and then you finally do get something. I think all those years and years and years of rejection, and then you could really fuck with people's heads. But yeah, it's really bad. Especially when they're already a little bit insecure. They're already a little bit nutty. They already maybe possibly a little bit depressed, maybe a little bit chemical, you know? Yeah. I just

Speaker 4:          02:07:36       never thought like anybody else's success diminished me. Like I didn't think because Eddie Murphy got 48 hours that if he didn't get it, I was going to get it. You know? I just never thought like,

Speaker 2:          02:07:44       no, you never did. You never had and you've never had like this, uh, this is a weird resentment than a lot of people have towards, uh, people that they've no relation to. You know, look, you fucking this guy, you know, damn Wayman steam Wayne, since he's a motherfucker. Damon Wayans ain't got shit. I was like, you know, why? What do you care about Damian Wayans is he hitting to in any way affecting your path?

Speaker 4:          02:08:07       I mean, look at your career. Are you, you have the, you have such a, I mean, it's such a unique is redundant, but I mean like, I could never fucking announced this. The fights like you do, you, you're an expert on that shit. What did he, there's no competition. You're stand up and mine are so different to hopefully the only end result is they're both funny.

Speaker 2:          02:08:28       We're both very lucky. You know, we're both very lucky that we figured out our, our, our path in life. You know, I just, I'm, I'm in a weird spot where I'm extremely lucky because I liked to do a lot of things. Yeah. And I get lucky that there's a job for those things. Like if the UFC didn't exist, I would watch an exact, I mean if the job, rather than me being a commentator didn't exist. If they just, we just watched fights live and no one ever talked about it, I would still be doing the same thing. I'd be doing the exact same almost. Yeah. I mean I would, I wish certain wouldn't be breaking it down for a broadcast, but I'll be watching every single one of them. I'd watch everything. I've watched them live if I could. I did before I even worked there.

Speaker 2:          02:09:03       I just got super lucky. You can hear how happy or doing the, you can hear it in your voice. You'll love it. Yeah, I do enjoy it. It's fun, but I'm, I'm just lucky. I'm lucky. There's a lot of cool shit to do in the world. You know, martial arts is just one of many cool things. I mean, I could probably learn new things forever and ever and always be excited. Like skateboarding seems like it'd be fun. I just started learning how to ski. Skiing is fun. It's exciting. I mean, I bet it would be really fun to learn how to play an instrument. You know? If I had more time, I'd probably pursue that. I started doing archery recently. I got these targets. I set them up in my backyard. I bought a bowtech experience. 60 pound poll, compound bow. Oh Dude. It shoots things like a laser beam.

Speaker 2:          02:09:43       What's amazing? Come on. Oh please, come on over. Let's have a boat party. Please hide those from the kids. They can't touch it. They could never pull it back in the first place. I mean hours a locked up the the bow. It's so incredibly difficult to pull back 60 pounds like he a grown man, like yourself. Not like me. Of course I could just pull that bitch back. Flip for real. The really strong guys actually use a 70 pound bull beau guy in here yesterday. It's probably 20 pounds lighter than me. He actually uses a 70 pound bow, so he's used a bow that's 10 pounds a stronger than mine, but I'm just learning how to do it now. I'm not really concerned with it being like the fastest boat in the world. I just enjoy hitting targets. I have these rubber, um, squares like set up at different parts of my yard and I get up on this little platform in my yard.

Speaker 2:          02:10:27       I get the dogs out of the yard and shoot arrows. It's fun, man. It's really exciting. It's when you hit a target that you want to hit, like whatever reason, you know your, your, your body goes Ooh. Yeah. It's like, it's more exciting than shooting a basketball into a net like basketball, new. Ned's always been exciting like playing horse like three points. Whoa. But, but a fucking 50 yard bullseye with an arrow. There's something like it goes to your DNA, some Robin Hood. Shit. It's leftover third some watermelons in the backyard. That sounds fun. Yeah, but watermelons or food. I don't want to waste food. I feel guilty. I can't be wasted food. But I'll fuck up a squirrel that got catch slipping. I'll eat to squirrel that I catch from my backyard. What do you think about that? That rhino that that's in the news fucked up.

Speaker 2:          02:11:12       Fucked up. Fucked up. Crazy, ridiculous. Doesn't make any sense. Makes me sick. I don't like the idea for you don't know the story. There's a black rhino. They audition, they auctioned off a a right to hunt. This black rhino and the, the winning bidder paid $350,000 to kill this, uh, endangered Anna. That's fucked up. And because of that, $1 million is going to go to the preservation of the black rhino. I think that's ridiculous. I think that guy's an asshole. I don't care if that money goes to the preservation would, this guy should do, if he's really concerned, this guy, this hunter is go hunt with a camera, goddammit. Go get a really good close up photograph of this thing and know that you could have killed it. No, you've could have killed it. You don't have to kill you. And then while you're there, go shoot some shit that you can kill your in Africa.

Speaker 2:          02:12:01       Go shoot some wild buck. Go shoot some a ward hogs. Go shoot some things that the locals will eat, you know? And then it actually benefits the people there. If you go to Africa, like I saw Matt Hughes who's a former UFC champion, one of the greatest mixed martial arts fighters ever. He's also a big hunter and he went to Africa with his son and he took all these photos of them shooting these animals and people just were all up his ass. They were just shitting all over him and tell him, you know, he's an asshole and he's not even eating that food. These are trophy hunters. He shot so many animals. Well they don't realize is when you go there and you do something like that, they take the money that you use to pay for your trip and that money goes to preserve these animals.

Speaker 2:          02:12:44       Then the meat from hunting, that animal goes to feed these local villagers. Like they get very happy, like they're excited. They get all this lean, they don't have guns, and so they get all this lean protein free from these hunters and they get it every day because every day they're bringing in new hunters and everyday they're harvesting new animals. Like people don't like it because they feel like it should be a direct relationship. You should shoot a deer, then you eat the deer or give some of the meat out to your friends or something like that, which I kind of agree with. I don't want to be the guy that's like going somewhere to kill animals for a bunch of different people. But if you did, that's actually a very selfless thing to do. I mean, he's enjoying the hunting aspect of it, but he's also donating all these, all this meat to poor people, but nobody wants to see it that way.

Speaker 2:          02:13:28       Everybody has this black or white thing when it comes to animals. Either you love animals and respect them and you don't shoot them, or you hate animals and you were fucking evil person. Even if you both have the same diet. I mean the idea that someone would want to kill that thing when we know there's only like a few thousand of them left, that's fucking crazy. You know? I hope so many steps in and I hope, I mean really that's something that the president should talk about. The president should have a fucking joint conference where he talks about seaworld and killing black rhinos and B, just say, what did, what would we do if someone came here from looking? They sought off the horn. Oh my God. That's fucked man. Know why? Right? Yeah. Because Chinese dudes think that it makes your dick hard on her pills.

Speaker 2:          02:14:11       They haven't figured out if I angry at, I guess, you know. No Way Rhino Horn is as good as Viagra, by the way. You know what Rhino Horn is? Its hair. You're eating hair? Yeah. That horn his hair. It's thickly knotted hair that grows into a point. Yeah. It's not like an antler, like this deer antler here. This antler falls off every year and you find them on the ground. They're called sheds and they grow every year and then you know, they, they butt heads with those things on that side bar. Well, that's not the case of the Rhino with a rhino. It's actually hair. It's like the same thing to fingernails. It may not. It's like Keratin. It's kind of crazy shit man. But the, the idea that anybody would pay to do that, like don't do it man. Don't fucking kill rhinos. These aren't in the, like there's been an argument against killing elephants, but, and there's certain areas of Africa where they have an overpopulation issue with elephants and they've taken to assassinating elephants.

Speaker 2:          02:15:05       They've taken a hunting though. It's really freaky because they're bringing in hunters and it was a TV show on the other night where this guy went to Africa and just snuck up on an elephant and shot it in the fucking head. And it doesn't seem right. It seems fucked up. Did you ever play with every bulls? No. No. Never played it. Right. The gave the food to the villagers and they were saying this though, uh, years food. Cool. So yeah, I guess, but there's something about elephants. It freaks me out. It freaks me out. They kill elephants. Wales. Yeah. To me, elephants are smart as shit. They recognize each other when they haven't seen each other in 20 years. Did you know that? Really? Yup. That's the whole memory thing then. Yes. Yes. Will they have really good minds. Their minds are. They're much more complex than we ever thought they gonna.

Speaker 2:          02:15:47       In fact, they can create art. You can teach an elephant to use a paintbrush and they can draw themselves. Really? You never seen that? Oh my God, wait, do you see this? I'm going to show you something. You know what? I'm going to believe a thrill. It's an elephant painting himself and when you see it and how good it is, it's like what my five year old would do. It's like a five year old human, I don't know if that represents like the same, if that's the same intelligence is like a small child, but God damn it, it seems like there's something really serious going on behind the scenes there. They're able to draw themselves. Dot Merera they're able to self portrait. Pull ahead because there's a long ass video, but look at this. He's using his and you would think, okay, this is bullshit. This is fake. No, he really is. He's his own trunk and he's trying to draw what he sees. Look at, he's drawing tusks. Dom Arrera. He's drawing the legs. It's like perfect and like how he got it perfect, but like fucking incredible. Incredible. That's an intelligent animal and in my opinion, hunting that animal should be,

Speaker 2:          02:16:48       Aye. Look how good that is. God dammit. And saying that should be the last resort for real. Yes. It's for real. Like Shit. It should be the last resort when it comes to preserving these animals. That's ridiculous. What they should do is figure out a way to either move them to areas where there are populations have drastically decreased or find some way to give them some food that makes them less likely to get pregnant. I mean, who knows what strategies they could come up with, but shooting them seems really sad to me.

Speaker 10:         02:17:21       Okay.

Speaker 2:          02:17:22       Yeah. That's amazing. That's super smart. And that's smarter than a wolf. Okay. That's unbelievable. Yeah. I mean that's the argument against killing wolves is that they're smart and they're very much like dogs and you know, but that's way smarter than a fucking both. That's smarter than a monkey man. That's smart as shit. How smarter these God damn things. Okay, cool. Yeah, it's interesting to watch you do it. This is not bullshit. Look them. Do it. See now you can see the actual full elephant. Look at this. I mean this is utterly incredible. Utterly incredible.

Speaker 10:         02:17:55       Eight every in a bag. It,

Speaker 2:          02:18:00       it's amazing. Wow.

Speaker 2:          02:18:03       Yeah. I Dunno man. Then the relationship with the relationship between you're going to die. Nope. The relationship that we have between other animals is a very strained one. It's very strange how we, because we have some animals that we use for food and some animals that we decide to use as a resource and you know, it's, it's all very cruel. I don't understand the rationalization. Sometime between with animals you picked to kill, to eat in the sense that people are pescatarians. What makes them think fish are happy to be on a hook and, well the idea is that fish don't take care of their young.

Speaker 10:         02:18:39       Okay.

Speaker 2:          02:18:40       Dov or dolphins swim fish. Yeah. Fish don't take care of the young. So they're like, fuck these fish. Look how good that is tomorrow. He true fucking flowers in his, in his trunk. Oh, it's insane. It's insane. It's insane. How, how talented this elephant as a drawing. I mean, that's better than most people could probably draw now. I think if you kill that, that that's murder. Yup. Look at this. Look at this thing. Painting the sky, man. Are you fucking shitting me? It's painting a word.

Speaker 10:         02:19:05       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:19:06       Jesus Christ. This is the sad, so sad. It's just sad. I Dunno. Youtube. It's under a, if you guys want to see it, it's under elephant's painting. Elephants suit. That's the, remember the name of him. He was writing his name and he knows how to write his name. I mean, this is insanity. Do you kill that thing? That's murder. That's like a big giant person. Or sometimes it's just, it doesn't, that doesn't make any sense to me. Whatever that is. It doesn't make any sense to me. Mindblowing. Mindblowing. Unbelievably fascinating. But to those villagers, one years food, we just eat [inaudible]. I mean, I can't fucking believe that. It's hard to believe. Yeah. I think if I walk out of here and I hear you guys laughing, no intelligent animals, intelligent animals are, uh, am I, in my opinion, we should treat them very differently than we treat everything else.

Speaker 2:          02:19:56       Well, I never believed that animals couldn't think. I always believe they always sit in with dogs. Don't think it's just instinct. I don't buy that. No animals. Fucking thank man. Of course they think they just don't think as well as we do. So we like to say they don't think they're just, they're limited. I mean their, their, their bodies are about survival and breeding survival and breeding. And those are the only things they don't create culture. You know, we become ultra complex because we create culture and we, because we have the ability to manipulate our environment. So that's why we categorize dolphins in this weird gray area that allows us to enslave them because they can't create culture and because they can't manipulate their environment, they don't have fingers, we don't see any evidence of their intelligence. But meanwhile, there's tons of scientific evidence of the fact that they can communicate with each other, that they have a language lab ILX that they have family communities, that they recognize each other long distances that they pulled together.

Speaker 2:          02:20:45       I mean it's, it's an, it's an intelligent thing that you're in slaving. It's all, it is. It's, there's no if, ands, or buts about it. It's a bad argument. Whether it's an Orca, you know, orchids are fucking even smarter than dolphins there. There's super intelligent animals. It's madness. It's madness, it's total madness. And when you see an elephant that can paint a fucking picture better than most of us in this room, what does that, that that elephant paints better than you? That's the most phenomenal thing I've ever seen an animal do. It's incredible. It's incredible. Have you ever seen chimps spelled her name? Chimps can spell their name. Uh, for candy. They teach them how to solve complex puzzles and they give them candy and then they can remember the order of files. They can count things from one to seven, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

Speaker 2:          02:21:30       And they, they, you know, like the images will go blank and they'll remember which one was one, which one was two. And we'll reveal like each and development, make it flip over in order. Something that I would struggle with. Sure. Yeah. He's locking up chimps is conti to putting them in a zoo is stupid. They should have them in an area where they live in the wild and observe them. That's it. All this other stupid shit where even if they make enough wild that it seems wild to them. Yeah. Maybe if you have a really large place, but like that lady in Connecticut that was living with one and the one they wound up biting her friend's face off, that is criminal negligence. I mean that's no different than building bombs in your yard and your friend comes over and you're below your friend's face off was so fucking Straw.

Speaker 2:          02:22:12       Just not just strong, but violent as fuck. And guess what? She gave the chimp Xanax. Really? Yeah. She gave the chimps Xanax and wine bitch was crazy. Well, she had this 200 pound murderous monster living in her house is yoked up super monster. He was in the, he was in a cage. Right? It's where a diaper. Yeah. I don't think he was in a cage. Oh, I thought he was in a cage when he reached out from her. No, no, no, no, no, no. He, he lived in, uh, he, he wanted around and do whatever you want it, but the woman was babysitting them. No. What happened was the, a woman's friend came over. A woman's friend came over. The chimp did not like the woman's friend. The woman's friend kept him from her. Maybe. Maybe he thought of her as his girlfriend. So he just attacked and just ripped her apart.

Speaker 2:          02:22:56       Holy Shit. Look at the muscles on this fucking things. Are you kidding me? Man? That looks like who some are Paul Harris, but even more muscular. He's definitely on it. I could see him using kettle bells and battle ropes. Zombie ones. Chimps gives zero fucks. That's one of the scariest animals in the world. If it's trying to get you, because if they got ahold of you, like you might be able to even fight off a bear to the point where the bear decides like, you're too crazy. Fuck it. I'll leave them alone if the bear wasn't hungry, if it's a nutty bear, but a chimp is not going to let you win, you know they're, they're having a contest with you and they're going to bite your fingers off. They're going to beat you census, they're going to pull your genitals off. They'll pull your pants off and bite your ass hole.

Speaker 2:          02:23:34       It's like they know how to hurt you. They're smart. I think it would be one of the most terrifying animals have to face in an encounter. Yeah. I'd probably take my chances with like something like a shark before it champions. People have lived, I mean, people live in chimpanzee fights too, but they get ripped apart. Sometimes people they get rescued. It's usually in preserves that all this stuff happens too, by the way, in the wild. It's very rare that a chimpanzee attacks a person, but did you see that picture that I had on Twitter the other day of a Jaguar that had got killed with his bare hands? This is, we don't make men like this anymore. [inaudible]. It's an old black and white Joda motherfucker killed a Jaguar with his hands. Bare hands. It says it's on my Twitter page. It's just I think yesterday. Yeah. Look at this motherfucker, Carl eight glee.

Speaker 2:          02:24:19       I salute you. You fucking savage of a man. You real man. You make me feel weak as a bitch. Look at that. God Damn savage, he killed a leopard with his hands. That's how you know. That's how you know you can hold up under pressure when you're duking it out with a cat. That's a big cat too. It's not a big leopard. What do you think that weighs? 20 yeah. No, that's not that heavy. That's like 70 pounds. 60 70 pounds. The neck or you see how, look at, look at it compared to his body. No, it doesn't say how he did it. At least I didn't read it. Look at it in relationship to his body. You know it's, it's a perspective thing. If you brought the head all the way down to the ground, the head is a suspended about where his knee is.

Speaker 2:          02:25:03       It's hanging by its back feet. If you brought the head all the way to the ground, it really wouldn't even be as, as long as his, uh, his most of his upper body. Why was he even engaged with you? And it must've his lower body, right. Did he come after him? He had attacked him. Oh, jumped him. Try to eat them. People had been selling ever since I been putting up pictures from trail cameras, people have been sending me trail camera photos of mountain lions that they catch in their yards or mountain lions that they catch near their house. A guy sent me one today from Florida of these two fucking muscular Florida panthers. You know, I've never seen a panther. Never seen a mountain lion. No. I've seen my online, but I've never seen a panther the same animal. It's a smaller though, isn't it?

Speaker 2:          02:25:44       Um, maybe, maybe it doesn't get into food or maybe I was in the keys a couple of weeks ago when we were talking about that, cause they have the signs up. It'd be aware of them, you know? Well, like most fucked up things in Florida, the population is growing. The population of fucked up people in Florida is growing. The population of fucked up cats is growing. The population of alligators is growing. Population of bath salts, abusers is growing. Foreign is fucking crazy. And Don, my ray was going to be there this weekend lady. That can segue now that's a segue. I want to put that in my driveway. Just scared to go to people. He, Brian, can we set up a Gopro on the Werewolf please? We do that. Let's figure that out. That's your next project that is fucking tearing apart from the Werewolf drop found every time I walk in here though is do you see a picture of Eddie Bravo, Eddie Bravo radio.

Speaker 2:          02:26:27       Use The podcast studio the other night. Powerful. Jamie stepped in and saved the day. He Bravo's computer crashed and Eddie called me up like last minute and he's like, dude, I'm fucked. Like the podcast is in a half an hour, you know, and my computer's crashed and I didn't. So he came over and use this place. Um, but when he did, he took all his clothes off and took a photo of him. Fucking the Werewolf pull that shit up is Eddie Bravo. He will commit to things in a way that very few people can. I'd love this fucking dude. He's so crazy. This, this is a total Eddie Bravo picture that he would send you like this, uh, epitomizes why I love this dude is one of the reasons why he got a job as a writer on the man show. And he probably has crazy lucky look at least committing to it. He screamed at the top of his lungs, all of his clothes are off and he's banging the Werewolf from behind. It would have been a little bit better if he had like a little bit more of an angle so we could actually see his ass cheeks. So we know he's really, really naked. He's so crazy though. Look at him. He's so silly.

Speaker 2:          02:27:31       I love that too. Powerful. Eddie Bravo. So, uh, yeah, we're going to let other people do it too. So you know, any, all of our friends who do podcasts, I know Tommy wanted to use it at one point in time and Dunkin's going to use it like whenever they need to do shit on with cameras and what have you. I think it makes this place more the merrier. The more, uh, I feel like the more good conversations we have in this place, I feel like it's soaks into the wall. So it's good in a jail. Yeah. I love this fucking place. When I come here, I feel like I'm at home. I feel like this is our, uh, our weird little, oh, it's very cool. Portal to the rest of the world. I like to lift factory the, you know, but just for the comfort of being on the stage, I'm comfortable.

Speaker 2:          02:28:09       Well, that's a, also a stage. He performed that for like two and a half decades. Right. That's a great place. So yes, since the late eighties. Yeah. Jesus Christ. That's even more, right. What does that 46, 40. Yeah. Jesus Christ. Yeah. 46. 2014. Oh, 26 rather. Yeah. Yeah. I say you are. I'm 46. That's what I meant. Uh, I graduated in 85. I was 21, so it's probably at the lift. I was 89 and 90 doing half talking and half a adding my age on there. So what year I was, um, in 86 I was not 21. I was 21 in 88. Joe, wait, here we do a full photo. Come to comedy will, I mean I can't do math when you're talking to me. Oh, sorry. It's still complicated. Full frontal comedy. 93 I think. Did we the one in um, Montreal? No, no, that was uh, uh Oh that was dangerous zone.

Speaker 2:          02:29:01       That was also a showtime, right? Yeah, I think so. I think it must have been 94 then. That's when don my railroad and I became pool playing partners. Wow. Oh, we met in Amsterdam billiards. So we first found out that we both, we each played pool. It's right. Total luck by chance. I was in town doing a Gig. Don was doing a Gig and we went up by knocking some balls around together and I said, you got a good stroke there, Mr Right Herrera, you got them out of bed and play pretty good fella for a comedian. The all Comedians Pool League is a U. R e should fear, um, me. Um, uh, uh, what's his name from Adam for our please. Very good. And please very consignments. Greg Fitzsimmons please. Very good. There you go. That's good. And what I was trying to think of as Craig Anthony, Craig Anthony from the movies are Anthony, uh, shit.

Speaker 2:          02:29:50       Mike Robinson. Kay Robinson. Craig Anthony. Who's Craig Anthony? Uh, the guy from breakfast. Someone's Craig Anthony. Why do I know that name? Craig Robinson from, yeah, he's cranky and seeing a fighter. I didn't drink Robinson. Craig Robinson from this is the end. Did you see that? They just see him and this is the end. That's the little bit of smoothies on the office, right? James Franco? Yeah. Yeah. Good guy. He's a poet. Craig. Anthony, you're thinking of a post that's where is, yeah, Craig Robinson. Sorry, Craig. Craig is hilarious. He's, and he's a really good pool player too. Apparently Vinny fat Burrito can play too. Yeah. Yeah. Allegedly. I've never seen him, but I've heard he plays really good. Tried to hustle me. Oh too slick. No Way. Oh, I got a helical tussle. Dama rare fucking happen. You don't have a gambling issue. Do I love to gamble but I don't gamble much money.

Speaker 2:          02:30:33       I love gambling on football. Yeah, it's fun. The juice of it is, is a riot just gabbing a little spark to the game and I'm talking like 50 bucks and nothing that I think that should be legal man. Oh, it's so stupid. Bums me out that that's not, I feel like you should be able to bet at any corner. You know, there should be some sort of a way that you could, uh, you know, like fucking regulate how it gets taxed or it, you know, where we can all meet and gamble on things. We should be able to bet against each other. We should be able to put our money jointly into something and it gets deposited into either one of our accounts. If we win and the government takes a little piece off the top to make sure it gets taxed and that's it. Let people gamble. You go to any police station and the have football pools. Yeah. Why not? What's wrong with that and not say nothing. They shouldn't get in trouble for that either. It's fucking ridiculous.
