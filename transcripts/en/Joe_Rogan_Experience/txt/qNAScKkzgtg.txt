Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hmm.

Speaker 2:          00:00:06       Before we even started the podcast, rest in peace. John Anthony West, he, uh, died yesterday. One of the coolest guys ever. One of my favorite people that ever got on the podcast, the first and only full gas that I've ever done skype. And the only reason why I did it on Skype, he's cause he wasn't feeling well and he couldn't fly to California. So I said, this guy is so important. I generally like to have conversations with people when they're in the room. I think they go more friendly and they're smoother. That way you can work through any bumps easier. That way he feel better. It feels like it's real. I mean, but he was so important to me. I would have fucking taken, uh, a raven note. You know what I mean? He just, if you'd never seen, um, the DVD series, magical Egypt, it's truly an amazing piece of work.

Speaker 2:          00:00:55       Um, it's, I think six dvds all about the history of Egypt and the immense complexity of the structures that are built there. The appreciation this guy had for what the Egyptians did was just off the charts. He was just so deeply engaged with it. It was such a giant part of his life and the passion and the curiosity that they had in the knowledge that he had. And these dvds would come through and you would just be like holding your face watch. And I'm going, all my God, these are amazing. Just what a crazy time in human history, this weird blip in the middle of North Africa where these people just went past everybody else just way past. And they did it for a long time. Man. They did it in this one spot for who knows how long. That's where it was. Thousands and thousands of years. And Graham Hancock and John Anthony West are the people that are really, uh, at the front of the line in terms of the public eye of pushing the timeline back and there's real evidence for it.

Speaker 2:          00:02:09       Yeah, sure. I mean, hancock's getting super vindicated or, yes, he is. And you know, um, John Anthony West had vindicated as well by um, uh, Robert Schoch, who's a geologist from Boston University. He went to Egypt and he studied the enclosure that the Sphinx was in and he's the guy that determined that you were looking at fishers that were created by thousands of years of rainfall, which would push back because what we know about the, the what the climate was like in that area. Apparently it pushes it back to somewhere around 9,000 years ago, which is crazy. Yeah. Cause look however old it was, it's real. The pyramids are a real thing. Sure. I mean everybody gets real weird about pushing the date back. Like when it happened. There's no way it happened 30,000 years ago. It definitely happened. 2,500 BC maybe. Maybe, but it'd be, even if it did, let's just say it all was, it just came out of nowhere.

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       Some are around that Arrow. What a crazy spot, man. I mean forget about the, the, the, the, the confusion and the conflict around the timeline. Just what it is. Those people were on another level. What is the main reason people get so pissed off at Hancock and West for trying to push the timeline back? Because they'd been teaching one timeline for a long time. They don't want to admit they were wrong. If somebody publishes a book about the timeline and just say definitively says, we know now that Egypt was a, you know, hunter gatherer culture that somewhere around 3000 BC erupted into this incredible civilization. Right? They just been teaching that for so long. I mean, there've been teaching, uh, not that version of it, but there were, their version is more accurate than what I just said. I'll just making up numbers. But the point is, what they've been teaching is probably not right.

Speaker 3:          00:03:57       And if they wrote books about it, they've t taught classes about it. All these people, it's ego. It's just the ego of scientists. There is 100% some ego involved because there was a conversation that John Anthony West and doctor Robert Schoch had with an egyptologist and the Egyptologist. This is on a television show that was actually on TV. It was on like NBC. It was called the mystery. That's finks. It was actually narrated by Charlton Heston and, uh, it was all about John Anthony West work and about Graham Hancock's work and Robert shocks work. And, um, when they brought this geological evidence to these egyptologists, they were openly mocking it, like laughing in this weird way. What evidence is there for this civilization back then? Like how much evidence do you think would be there? Like you have to realize how long ago he's talking about, he's talking about maybe 10,000, 500 BC, maybe earlier.

Speaker 3:          00:04:56       They think it might have all started somewhere around 30,000 years ago, which is just fucking bananas. Oh, there it is. Mystery. This famous powerful Jamie finds it online are they are John Anthony West that he, um, litter literally dedicated his life to absorbing as much information as possible about the nature of the construction, the time periods, the hieroglyphs. I mean, it's just an amazing, amazing body of work that that guy put together. Powerful. Charlton Heston look eager that I can answer. I would hang out with him. I don't care. Even if he was wacky, we wanted to talk about guns all day. I'd be like, come on Charles and hang out with Charlton Heston was going to turn down. Charles, do you remember when Charleston has another gun on TV and it was like they'll take my rifle away when they pry my cold dead hands off of it. Did he hold up a rifle when he said that? I imagine. I don't know man. I think he probably did. I so not. Why not?

Speaker 4:          00:05:58       Why not? Why not hold up your fucking massive symbol for your cock, your Harry Potter? He said it. It's real. It's just as I imagined. He will never take my cock for me. It's even better because it's a musket. Why not just hold up a rock just like got rock any rock, huh? Yeah. People get fucking really passionate about that. That guns circumcision. I am.

Speaker 3:          00:06:25       Oh, I am all for responsible people being able to own guns, but I'm also completely in agreement with people that say that there's too many people out there committing crimes with guns. So how do you, how do you, how do you clean all that up? I do not know.

Speaker 4:          00:06:42       Well, it's worth thinking about. It is worth thinking about and it's worth talking about. And people get upset when you start talking about it because they want it to be just know we have a right to have any kind of gun that we want, but they're, I think they're missing. Um, one of the real big problems, which were just weirdly seeing the very beginning of it, dude. And this ties in, you know, like Elon Musk just blasted the fucking car and his face. He blessed the Tesla, the space. There's a tesla floating around the planet now. And like the, the way that connects with guns is, um, this is an example of technology falling into the hands of like a private company. This isn't the government. This is like Ilan fucking bad ass. I go to burning man musk, a dude who goes to burning man, shot a fucking tesla into space, which is now, I guess going to rotate around the planet for some certain, I don't know how long it's going to be up there. Well, I think it's going to Mars. Oh, that fucking thing is going on. Put it in orbit around Mars. It's going past Mars. Oh, you fucked up he lawn. Well guess what man, that could have been my mom. My mom can fill on that plane. You fucking asshole. You fucked up. Ilan. You could have done better dumb dumb with your rockets that can land and shooting a gun in his face. Okay, what? That is what happened.

Speaker 3:          00:08:00       It's when you take it out of the government's hands and put it in a geniuses hands, but he's got a very unique ability to get things done. Sure. That boring project that he's doing under La flame throwers, there's certain guys that are so smart that everybody goes cause okay, sure. Everybody has steps back and go, what do I do? Want to dig holes through the bottom. Beth, what else do you went to the La City Council meeting? It's like, look guys, I can fix this traffic thing. What I'm going to do is I'm going to drill holes underneath the ground and I'm going to put your car on a high speed sled and

Speaker 4:          00:08:29       you don't even drive this. It's like, okay guys. So, uh, you've been, you remember the old like how it used to be at the banks with the suction tubes. Where are you taking a tube and you, your mom puts the check in and it gets sucked in. I'm going to do that with fucking buses under the city. What do you think? Write the check. They're not going to let you do it. But the thing where it connects to guns is it's like we're looking at the very, very, very beginning of of private individuals having access to technology that normally it was in the hands of the state governments. And this is the very crazy beginning of it. I didn't know he was shooting at, at Mars for some reason. I thought that fucking thing was going to like rotate around the earth, which made me worry that like we're going to end up with like a ring of billionaire car cause he'll be like the coolest thing for billionaires to do.

Speaker 4:          00:09:21       Shoot your car up. It's also a great way to dispose a body's cause. Like there's that astronaut in there and I keep thinking like, I bet that's one of the Elon Musk's enemies. I bet he that could be a body in there and no one would ever fucking magic of it is just some asshole who robbed Elan Musk in a business deal. Yeah, just shot the guy and have one of his flunky stuff. I'm into a car you never fight. Just disappeared. He just disappeared. That can be fucking anybody man. Control to major Tom and then also what's really bad as about this is the flat earthers are now like really having problems because of the, somebody sent me a video today, show me that it's fake. The building on twitter so many that this is fake. It's fake. Brown was frank bro. What is that? What's fake up like what's the thing? The moon, the sky. The God of the car. Your mom is flat, fake, fake, fake. Fake.

Speaker 4:          00:10:17       Your mom's flat as fuck man. Your mom's flouted in the plant earth Bro. And the earth's flat. But is it this like the, the, what's crazy about the John Anthony West stuff and the Graham Hancock stuff is like in the way that flat earth and delusional insane way sort of forces you to imagine yourself existing in a universe that's completely different than what you thought. And I think that's why it's really appealing. Like it's an appealing cool, beautiful, hilarious mythology was just like, whoa, how cool would that be if we really were on a flat earth? And like if I just keep going in one direction and hit the ice wall, hit the ice well, but over the fucking ice, well now we're in the land of the grays, you know, I'm no longer trapped. It's like, it's a freeing feeling because like, even though it's not like I travel enough to feel stuck in fucking California, which is an insane thing, there's a little piece of us that knows we're never going to go into space.

Speaker 4:          00:11:09       We're never going to get past. We're never going to, how do you get off the map? You know what I mean? Like there's something in a human that wants to get off the fucking map where you end up in a place that hasn't been charted yet and that's an experience that's gone basically like the, I mean I imagine swaths of the Amazon perhaps or like some place deep deep in the Arctic may be in a cave or something, but it used to be people just didn't fucking know you could go off the map and you had no idea. I think that must have been the biggest rush to be on a ship and looking at the maps that you guys have and you're like, fuck dude, this is, we don't know where we're at here man. Like this is unknown uncharted terrain. So flat earth is a really, I'm not, I don't believe the earth is flat.

Speaker 4:          00:11:52       I it's more like a triangle shape. But the other guy, it's a big Dick. It's a giant cosmic dick at that would be looking at the head of the Dick and they just don't want us to know that cause it's kind of embarrassing. Fucking earth looks like a big spinning Dick. It's all CGI, bro. Shaped like a dick. It's just a big blue and white fucking Dick Green. Yeah. Why do people want that? We want, we always want things to be weird, right? We want, look, the flat earth one is my favorite one because it's just, what could you imagine if their rights q magic they were writing, but I if the whole plant, I thought the world was round and there's all this information that shows the world is round. For thousands of years ago people were doing calculations are sticking sticks into the ground in equal distance and measuring them and trying to see if there's curvature and the this Zoe's been people that suspected the earth was round way before they could ever figure it out.

Speaker 4:          00:12:46       They were trying to sell it. Look well the moon is round, the sun is round. This is around. Oh yeah, probably this was round. Yeah. And how much she would kind of think, well how big is this fucking thing? And then if you get up high enough you can kind of see like wow, if it's this really big, I see like a very slight curvature. I can, maybe I do. Am I always on my mind? Fucking myself. Right. And you could just sat around and mind fucked yourself into thinking that it was all a scam. Yeah. And that the world is actually flat and then gravity isn't real either. Everybody's wrong. Yeah. Except but guy on youtube, it's exciting. It's magnets that pull people into the earth. Your life gets so exciting at that point. Oh yes. Now you are. You're, you feel danger. You're risking your fucking ass by getting out there.

Speaker 4:          00:13:32       Cause the Nass holes are going to take you out. Dude, the Clinton Foundation, Clinton Foundation finds out about your theories. The earth being flat. You're fuck, come get you. They're going to get you. So now you're living, now you get to live in maybe a not very happy world, but an exciting world because you're seeing vans, you're seeing fucking like create. Now this is, by the way, this is not say that there isn't some massive, huge unknown swath of reality that's sitting right in front of us at all times. It's actively being hidden by the United States government in the military. That the technology that they finally detected the thing and they don't want us to know because they know if we know who the fuck knows what the reason is, but they don't want us to know just yet. I'm not saying that's not the case. I'm just saying with flat earth in particular.

Speaker 4:          00:14:17       Freaking me the fuck out man. What do you know? What do I know? What do you know man? The fucking problem is I can't talk about it yet. Oh my, I stopped getting the check. They're like, you can't like, you know, we'll tell you but you can't, you can't completely reveal. It seems like one of the videos that would play before you, uh, first loading up halflife 10, this is the new new half life. The government is hiding a dimension. Well, I may have access to just come out was that they picked up some kind of Ufo like the government did release Ufo video.

Speaker 3:          00:14:53       I always assume this is captain skeptical over here. I always assume if the government is ever sang that there's Ufo shows or something really crazy like that, it's to hide some shit they're doing in like Guatemala. It's like they don't want anybody to be paying attention to something weird they're doing so they'll, they'll just start talking about u of o is everybody's art for real, like a real special, you've got a video man.

Speaker 4:          00:15:17       I mean it's a really huge question mark, which is, and there are people out there who like think, who say they have answers to why they're just this idea is there is a gradual dissemination of information that's happening because they're, they're priming the pump and then it splits into two versions. One of the versions of the stories is, fuck, if you want to dominate a planet, get them kind of like subconsciously, subliminally primed for the idea that you know, I think there's some really advanced technology out there and there's, there's aliens riding around in it and we've, and we make contact, we've made contact with a, they call themselves the Galactic Council of Celestial elders and they've been making contact with us for the last 50 years and they've been instructing us and how to not only reveal themselves to you, but to, to let the technology come out in a way that's not going to be completely catastrophic for our society.

Speaker 4:          00:16:16       There are peace loving, wonderful beings, but we've decided to follow their instructions to the t and so now they're ready to introduce themselves and then suddenly an alien is on TV and suddenly the government is using a completely made up thing to try to dominate the planet by saying, no, it's aliens. We found them when in fact it's project blue beam. Right. That's, that's one of the ideas that are their ideas. All that Shit's true. They, there's a thing that happens when a planet reaches a certain level of technological sophistication that it gets contacted by some kind of order council federation of Cindy and technological civilizations and they sort of begin to like walk the planet through phases of getting that shit out into the world in a way that isn't going to fuck up their planet and they know how to do it. They have a system in place, they don't come from the stars. They're not something detectable by telescopes there. Like in the DMT realm, are there like existing in some alternate dimension and technology is just one of the things that they, uh, use to communicate with us. I've

Speaker 3:          00:17:31       been toying around with this idea for a long time. Most of the time when I'm really high, that ideas are a life form that they're not, it's not as simple as your creativity, putting together some pieces that weren't there before. I think it's that, but I think it's you're

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       tuning into something, you're tuning into some weird, like some of the ideas almost seem to write themselves and it could be because the subconscious process of your mind, but it also could because the, because that these what ideas are and what just the concept of thinking is it's essentially the seeds of creation, right? Everything that's ever existed on earth, the humans have invented and built came from a mind. It came from thinking, how do I put together this house? Yeah, how do I put together this skyscraper? How do I make a plane? How do I make a TV? How do I make of this? How do I make of that? Like we're vessels for ideas. We're like sitting there with all these neurons firing and electricity going left and right, and all these areas of our brains lighting up. It's catching ideas. When I'm super gone, especially on edibles, sometimes I feel like I'm in a river of ideas and I'm naked and I can't hold the fish that just flying by me. I'm like, Jesus, just trying to get these ideas right. It almost feels like these are not at my ideas. These are ideas that I'm working on. I've put in the effort to go out and fish for these ideas.

Speaker 4:          00:19:01       Well it's kind of like imagine if there was a technology that could, like we send out these signals into space, um, satellites with er, with, with fucking records in them, but perhaps other civilizations are blasting the planet with ideas, Eh, that are designed to be picked up by the scope of the human mind. Yeah. And so what you're doing is you're actually like popping into an alien frequency which is filled with all these various ideas that are part of the cultivation of a planet to like try to get it to the point of like being able to make contact and they're, they're just seeding, seeding us with, with fuck. When you read like John Lilly and read about Tesla and read about a lot of the great inventions that have happened, the people who had the epiphanous moment, it wasn't like there was scrunching their fucking forehead. It was like the idea came to them and a vision. How many times do you hear over and over again? It came to me in a vision, a dream.

Speaker 2:          00:19:59       Do you know that the very notion of science itself, uh, came to supposedly like the birth of science came from a dream that day cards had really, yeah. He had a dream that, I forget exactly the term that he, the way they use it, I'm sure it was deciphered too, right? Like what did he originally speak? What language to car descartes speak?

Speaker 4:          00:20:20       Fuck, I don't know man. Like I think it was like classic Nerd,

Speaker 2:          00:20:27       but he was, um, he was out like at war, who's like campaigning. He is French, he's French. He was a, I believe it was like he was on a military campaign in the army or something along those lines. And uh, he signed up for adventure to go off into the military. And during that time period he had a dream that something about to be able to harness nature, it would be done in weights and measurements. I forget exactly the term, see if he could find the term. The, that was essentially what people say. This is really when you, when you talk about the very birth of the early, so you could trace back the idea of modern science, like the ethics and the ideas, the concepts of Mondo Science.

Speaker 5:          00:21:15       Well don't you from a dream don't date it goes, I mean before the cart we're dealing with like it gets really interesting because you're dealing with that outcome. It's like John d who were, who were, I mean Jon Dee was someone who is, who's John d? John D is, is it like, you know Jason Lu, you know that is, no, he's an author. He just wrote this fucking bad ass book on John D. Is this one of those people kind kinda like Crawley who had this huge impact on society but we don't really know a lot. We would, most people don't know the fuck he was. Right. But you've heard of like, uh, the Enoki and tablets are like the Gnocchi and angels basically. John Dee was like an outcome as to is working with Queen Elizabeth to try to turn lead into gold, which was a, you know, a big fucking pursuit back then, which is like, shit, if we could turn, if we can transmute metals into gold, it's like, I mean they all tried to yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:22:08       do that, right? Was that when they first started recognizing elements? Like when did they first start recognizing elements?

Speaker 5:          00:22:13       Um, I, I don't, I don't know probably that it's, it must be through alchemy cause they were like trying to break things down to their fundamental, they're trying to break things down to like their fundamental components. How many movies are about that? Someone trying to make gold? Well, I mean it's the, it's one of the great pursuits and it's actually, that's that there's a, it's what we're still doing only we're not trying to turn a lead into gold. We're trying to turn a lead into a thinking machine. That's what we're doing that because better than turning matter and to goal, if you can turn matter and do a fucking thing that is thinking and cindy hunt the nic and figure out how to turn lead into gold by its advanced ability to process data.

Speaker 2:          00:22:52       And if you were an alien race, you'd be concerned about nuclear weapons for sure, but you would really be concerned about artificial life. Sure. What do you, what do you assholes about to hit the switch on? Yeah. Have you thought this? This through would like those minions in despicable me. We're just wrecking shit and eaten nails, right?

Speaker 5:          00:23:10       Yeah. We just try and things stick in electrical sockets in our heads. Fuck yeah. Dude. Can you imagine if beings in the DMT Rome decided to start setting off nuclear explosions? I mean, maybe that's what an earthquake is. Maybe when we have an earthquake, it's like a nuclear test and another dimension shaking our planet. Yeah, I said it. No, I don't fucking believe it. I can already hear the light people being like, what the fuck are you talking about, man?

Speaker 2:          00:23:36       June 8th, 1637 day card cut codifies scientific method. Wow. Interesting.

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       He outlines his rules for understanding the natural world through reason and skepticism, forming the foundation of the scientific method still in use today. There a a term that he had that he came up with like in a dream, see if he could find that because there was like a phrase that he said obviously translated from French.

Speaker 4:          00:24:06       I, I, I the reason I s the dit cart fucking bugs before him, that one. No, it's not. I think therefore I am. Okay. But that was obviously an interesting one. He liked to do shit like, and I could be wrong about this, but I, I clearly remember reading about this. He was like, what do you call it mechanistically or like he believed the animals were just machines basically. And so, so like he would like, and I love Jamie if you could look this up. So I don't get a suede with people being like, that's a different person. But apparently he would do shit like hold that dog's beating heart and it's in his hand while it died. Oh my God. And he said things like, people who are afraid to kick dogs aren't really my students because they know it will look that up, Jamie. We share this, not like propaganda. If there was like an info wars.com back then like what's going on here? This is why I'm covering it with like, I'm not saying he's out there kicking dogs. I think he was kicking dogs. I think the cart like I just found it was pretty rough.

Speaker 3:          00:25:02       Maybe they all kick dogs back then. In a nutshell, frank fro philosopher Rene decartes didn't believe animals had souls to test his theory.

Speaker 4:          00:25:10       Nailed his wife's dog to a board and chopped it open while the poor thing was still a long guy. Fun Guy. Crater is science was a nail and dogs to fucking boards. Where'd you read this? How do we know it's on fucking hard.com? No, it's nuts. It's nuts. I hope that you really are knowledge, nuts, nuts for knowledge. I love nuts. That guy definitely looks like he fucking Nail Dogs to boards. Look at that fucking face.

Speaker 3:          00:25:36       Mm, mm. Look at it. Look at it. Squirm. The greatest minds are capable of the greatest vices as well as the greatest virtues. That's what he said after cut open a cat,

Speaker 4:          00:25:46       dude, that's like, it's the father of science is also like, that's Jeffrey Dahmer Level Shit too. Like he was not,

Speaker 3:          00:25:54       I think people did a lot of that back then. Nayland dogs divorce. I just think the, I think the value of life was severely diminished. I think back then the 16 hundreds people were dying left and right of everything. You got a cold dead break your leg dead, get gored by a bull, dead, everything dead. Oh, you got an infection dead. Well you got the flu, probably dead. But

Speaker 4:          00:26:16       that's definitely in Europe. Like in India. I'm not saying in India it was like a utopia and everyone is sweet to animals, but in Buddhism it was still, it was like there was, it was a lot more compassionate. Like that's true. Why do you think that happened? APP

Speaker 3:          00:26:29       and why does like like Thailand and places that are Buddhist places generally? I mean obviously there's violence everywhere, but generally more of a peaceful vibe. Right? Like Buddhist nations and Buddhist crying a little bit. Obviously flaws with everything. Yes. Anything involving people you're going to have outliers but over and all. Like one of the things that my friend was telling me about Thailand, he was like, dude, there's no crime over there. He's like, you just go over there. He's like everybody. It's like real easy, real easy to get along with everybody. It's like it's super safe. Nobody gets robbed was it's really rare.

Speaker 5:          00:27:04       Yeah, I don't, I mean, I don't know. I don't understand why that way of thinking emerged in the east and that connection with the south emerged in the east first, what happened in the west, which was basically decimation of a previous religion, right? Paganism, whatever you want to call it. Earth based religion, connection with life and nature, but what's really interesting. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:27:29       tell me about that. Is it the DNA of paganism is still in the system? It's almost like we absorbed it. Yeah. Like I say, we, I mean Christians, you know, Christian nation.

Speaker 5:          00:27:38       Well, look, it's work Christian nation. This is, I'm sorry. I'm sure we've talked about this in the podcast, but it's something I marvel over all the time. I think about it a lot, which is the Catholic mass. It's when you look at the Catholic mass and you look at the New Testament, the last supper, and you look at, you realize like in the fucking synoptic gospels and then any of the gospels, there is nowhere that Jesus is saying. What you do is take a piece of bread and utter these prayers over it to create it, to create my flash that didn't you eat, it's not there. The ritual isn't there and but, but the interpretation of that has turned into what is called high magic. It's called like, it's a ceremonial magic where you are transforming bread into the flesh of a sacrificed God and people do that every fucking Sunday and are like this totally normal magic. What are you talking about? I'm not in a fucking magic. What I do is I eat the flesh of a god that was sacrificed by Father God so that my sins could be purified. That's not magic. When did that originate the sacrament? Well, I've read that it has something to do with, it goes back to Egypt, that it, that it's some kind of high magic Egyptian ritual mushroom or as a mushroom

Speaker 3:          00:29:06       probably had a big bag of mushrooms and everybody came up and they put it on your tongue and they said, good luck.

Speaker 5:          00:29:12       Yeah, I know. Yeah. This is the place he on the other side. I mean they said, yeah, they said, um, you know, this is the flesh of God. Eat this to, and you'll remember who you truly are and they gave you this, the psychedelic and you took it and you merged back into the divine and realize your true identity so that for the rest of the week you were able to hang out with people and not be a complete ass hole. Cause you know, you share the same soul and that you're basically made of love as opposed to thinking that you and I are separate and that

Speaker 4:          00:29:42       were mostly sinful, evil things. Who's flashes impure? I mean that's another fucking sweet gift that came from um, fundamentalist Christianity is the concept that our bodies are evil. We can't be naked around each other. Even now. Like you can't take your clothes off around people without seeming completely insane. You will get a wreck if you go outside and your fundamental body that you are born into the universe with, you will get arrested. Like you can't walk around as you are, you have to cover it in clothes or if you're considered to be a fucking pervert, pervert, nudist, psycho. So yeah, the, the fundamental vehicle that we are so rides around and it's considered profane to, to, to do dude. And it like, you see a fucking deck when you're like walking down the street. Some dudes you're like, well you can see a dick accidentally at the bathroom and it doesn't bother, doesn't bother you.

Speaker 4:          00:30:44       Cause in the bathroom it's okay for a moment to profane the world with your fucking Dick. So it's like that's the, when you start really looking at all the, the, the traces of not just pagan culture, but just insanity from a fundamentalist perspective of the universe that has its roots in what appears to be a misunderstanding of a really beautiful story. Then it's like mind boggling. No, not just a misunderstanding, but probably a conscious misrepresentation of the original store that's molded the suit. Whoever's needs is in charge at the moment. That's right. Yeah. And people do, I'll tell you, man, Catholics, they feel guilty like they should. I'm Catholic. You're filling. You still probably feel a little bit, probably a little bit, dude. I was thinking, I'm not Catholic really, but I was, when I was in first grade, I have this allister Croley poster.

Speaker 4:          00:31:35       I was going to bring the uterus seven Oh wow. 1079 yeah. Yeah. It was the year. The year 1000 that's it sounds like it's a weird sounding name. Oh, a year. Other 1079 it feels like I'm saying something wrong. Yeah, yeah. Wow. That's amazing, man. Yeah, 1079 so this is way after Jesus almost a thousand years. Yeah. They started doing the magical ritual and and so it's like to say that this is connected to Christianity is really, it's like actually no, it's Christianity's a song and this is a dance people decided to do to it, but to say, you know what I mean? To say that it's like that it has anything to do with Jesus is, is not true unless you're going to say that Jesus transmitted the data after his death and do some kind of mistake or see, or who had the vision of this. Now I'm not knocking the fucking Catholic mass. I think it's beautiful, but let's just admit what it is. Magic. It's ritual magic. You're doing ritual magic and you're doing something that's been going on for a very long, probably before 1079

Speaker 5:          00:32:41       that dude wasn't just like sitting around. I'm like, Hey, I got an idea. Let's start saying prayer over the bread and the bread is going to turn into flesh. It was more like, hey, you know, we've been meeting doing these rituals secretly. Why don't we just incorporate the story of Christianity into this ritual that we've been doing for a very long time. Do you sort of, um, pure, purify ourselves by connecting to the universe and acknowledging the fact that existence itself is predicated on devouring the flash of some other being not, you know, like we're always in the process of inhaling the universe, exhaling the universe eating each other in the universe is eating itself. And so the mass is this ritualized version of like, behold, we're eating the flesh of God in everything we do. And there's something really beautiful about that.

Speaker 3:          00:33:32       I mean, there's no getting around life eats life. Even the various factions of, of uh, people on the left and the right and, uh, people that are animal rights activists versus people that are butchers. You're all eating something that's alive. I mean, you can make the distinction that the plants aren't suffering like the animals do. And that's why it's okay. Sure. I agree with you. For the most part, it's probably a less extreme form of suffering, but it also might just be a completely misunderstood life form like there. Well they're finding out so much about plant communication and I've read so many things about that. I hesitate to talk about it cause I really want to have all my t's sliced and i's dotted because it's such a complex issue, but it appears that they communicate. It appears that there's almost like a, that they're using the soil and the fungus in the soil and the mycelium, they all have this weird ecosystem. It's not just like one plant by itself in the dirt. You know, there's a network that they're connected to.

Speaker 5:          00:34:36       Did Jamie, there's this thing, I've just, this guy gave me this thing called a middy sprout, which is, it picks up, I guess the bioelectricity of plants or anything for that matter. But plants I've, I've got it. You stick it on your plant and it goes into like your, whatever your music system is and it translates it into Midi so you can turn, turn, turn the electricity of your plant and a music. Yeah, it's fucking cool. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:35:06       Yeah. That sound is the sound's coming from a tree.

Speaker 5:          00:35:11       Well, it's the electricity of the tree being translated in a middy, which is then being translated into sound. So it's, it's a way to convert that data into music. It's like you're converting the bio electricity into, it's not like that's the sound of a plant. It's not making celestial noises. That's just sending energy and creating mini, which is then being translated into the sound. So it's a way to observe the data instead of looking at it, I guess on an Oscilloscope or whatever, you would look at that with. Yeah, it's turning into, into

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       uh, and the audio so you can hear the pulsating kind of like rhythmic flow so that it's measuring electrical currents in the plant. That's, so there's that much of a variation that it's like going up and down all the time like that. Yeah. Yeah. It, I mean, I don't know that the total math behind it, but I've got one on my, I'm on a plan in my studio. Here's my take on it. The most potent psychedelic experience is dmt. DMT exists in so many different plants. It's in thousands of plants. They have, they have no idea why, but it's in them. And if it wasn't for Mano, Amy's Mano, Amy's Oxidase, monoamine oxidase Mao, which is what Mao inhibitors are. If it wasn't for that, that we have this in our body, we would be tripping on salad. He'd be tripping on grass. You eat certain grasses, you'd be blasted off to the center of the universe.

Speaker 3:          00:36:29       You know, for some sheep, DMT is poisoned. Like they get ahold of, of plants that have DNP even they fall over, has the legs and the legs start bucking up in the air. That's like a canary in the coal mine. He takes sheep out into nature and when they start dying, that's what you eat. I think it's [inaudible] grass in particular. I think there's a type of grass. Jamie's if you could find that grass that kill sheep, but it's a grass. A particularly rich. Yeah. Florist. Damn. How good's the memory on the kid even though he's, Hi Phillip Morris back. Yeah. That a flare induced Valera staggers and chief portions of the lower brain as seen to be damaged and oddly enough, tinted blue. They're responsible agents or the alkaloids contained in the various failing species. There are whispered rumors that can you, there are whispered fucking, that's a dmt website to that whispered rumors.

Speaker 3:          00:37:21       He's got a science not looking for wispy are whispers, whispered rumors, fucking hippies. The divine moment of truth is that the one that I'm in is one of those spangled made one where they use the a rant of me with Jim Brewer. That's cool. I was harp acute. I barely remember what I said, but as me and brewer, uh, we're high on pot lollipops or Jesus and they took that and took part of it and made it this really dope music end with a video to it. I don't know if that's their video, if they made that video. It does. It looks oddly similar. Like a tone down, like a pencil drawing of what you see when you do dmt and then, yeah. That's a sound. That's beautiful. Yeah. I the good old day time. Joe. Weren't those the good old days. Now we don't do it anymore though. Cause it's elite. Yeah. Why would we, well, it's illegal. There's no need. And also once you've been there, it's not like you have to keep going back just enough now Santa, I need these fucking, hey, I need to do right now. Get a better accountant. You know what I'm saying? That's right. And I, there's some fucking great accountants in the DMT realm. That's when I'll start doing right. They're accountants of your consciousness and they look at, you can go on.

Speaker 4:          00:38:38       No, no. It's the best. Yeah. That's pretty not too, did you get a finger wagging at you?

Speaker 3:          00:38:48       Yeah. Yeah. No. And it was like when I had a wacky thought, I had a bad thought, a thought when a rag that was on the wrong page. I was like, this isn't an that's cool.

Speaker 4:          00:38:59       Yeah. I love that. I love the in different psychedelic states. I love how you witnessed how your consciousness is forming your reality and the most extreme way. Yeah. Not as though like you're producing matter with your thoughts or anything like that, but you can watch this undulation or this flow going from when you're getting negative and dark. And it's interesting how different psychedelics portray this phenomena. But so like on acid you, I might see, depending if I'm taking a high enough dose, you start seeing like the faces and the in the Stucco of your ceiling, you know? And it's like when you start getting really depressive or scared, then the phases start doing like

Speaker 7:          00:39:42       oh

Speaker 4:          00:39:44       his thing at you and they seek in and they, or even when you're looking at yourself in the mirror you, the a similar things happens is you're just watching the way that your projection that's coming from the incessant flow of thoughts in your mind is reflecting on the reality itself. And it's a constant like shifting of light that sometimes is like looking into the deepest layers of hell. But then sometimes you see the most beautiful, sweet, incredible things because your not being freaked out by the flow of thoughts in your mind. That's the number one trick. You know, this is why now my old age, I really do understand why I'm a good practice, meditation, chanting, whatever. It may be pair so nicely with psychedelics. Yeah. Cause if you have one without the other, well you're missing out. But also your, you can really like go into some pretty terrifying places that you'd, that don't resolve in the way that they could potentially if you are doing the work, putting in the time before you take the Psychedelic, you know, not to sound like an old fucking guy like guy you got to, you do, you know, meditate and then too, but it does help a lot.

Speaker 4:          00:40:58       Well it, it's,

Speaker 3:          00:41:00       there's a weird way that we, we want to dismiss it because it seems almost like a pompous thing to ever say. You meditate or you encourage people to meds. Yeah. Like the same as I always have a cringy thing when I tell people to do yoga. Like am I going have to say this again? What I really mean it. Like I feel like yoga is one of the very best things that will pair with a cannabis use and with psychedelic. Sure. Cause I think it, it alleviates a lot. You know, another thing is really good is running and I think both those things, they alleviate a certain amount of anxiety and they create, uh, they, there's a blood through that.

Speaker 8:          00:41:34       Like when you're really pumping hard up a hill and you're running the huffing and puffing and you make it and you check your pulse and you recover quick and he'd go and do another hill run, there's a, there's a stimulation of your body because it's being forced to work hard, that's euphoric and after it's over, your brain's flooded with all these wonderful chemicals. You feel good, you feel friendly. And like I think that paired with psychedelic experiences, I think exercise is one of the most overlooked, so important. And it doesn't matter what style, like what you enjoy doing, but just got to get that blood going. You got to do something. Whether it's take a spin class or a yoga class or go for a good hike, do something where you're fucking huffing and puffing and you're really getting in some work, you're really sweating and your body will just feel

Speaker 5:          00:42:21       better. Well, this is what you just said exactly applies to meditation and also you're fucking right. The problem with even talking about it is you sound virtue signally and pompous and it sends it. But, but it's true. And when you hear Ron doss talk about meditation, he will say, I don't meditate when you want to meditate. Like don't, don't even like if it seems like something that appeals to you, give it a shot. But the, the, the, the definition of it, it's sat. What's funny is when you think about meditation, your mind will summon up something that you think meditation looks like. So you think, I mean it's like sitting down on a cushion with some fucking candles or it means like whatever it is that your mind summons up. And usually it's pretty austere and usually it's pretty requires like a temple or a space in your house or it's in south and I'll phone you need a robe. Exactly. He needs some kind of like shit that you're wearing, right? Because your mind is trying to push it off. It's trying to like your mind. It W it was as one of its functions. It seems to like not want you to sit still for a moment and watch. But what you just said about exercising, it's true for meditation. It's like there's so many different versions of it. And I would argue running is a meditation. Working out is a meditation. Yeah. And that to think that it's, there's a separation there. There really isn't.

Speaker 8:          00:43:44       No, I don't think there was either. I always just said that about martial arts. I believe that martial arts were a moving form of meditation, but that doesn't mean like stationary meditation isn't different and give you a, another very valuable thing and a different, a different valuable stuff.

Speaker 5:          00:43:59       Yeah. Well it gives you the ability to, I was just reading, there's a great book I'm reading by Pema Chodron called the wisdom and no escape. And uh, she talks about how when people start meditating they think, I'm, I'm doing this because I want to be a better person. And she said, that's actually an aggression against the south that you are right now to be like, Ooh. Yeah. It's interesting. Yeah. Yeah. That you're actually being like aggressive to your own self. She said meditation is not so that we become a better it

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       so that we're able to be who we are and the moment fully and to begin to experience fully what it is that's happening inside of us because for a lot of people what's going down is that there is a dude, this reminds me, I just watched the Texas fucking chainsaw massacre. It's probably like the 16th time I've seen it, but like I watched it and like man, I had some very strong mentee and like I was watching it and was like, oh my God, this is fucking unbearable. Like I can't deal with it. I'm going to go crazy watching this fucking thing. Like the woman who by the end is all bug eyed and covered in blood and like she's lost her mind because these Texas fucking cannibals if like driven her and saying I'm feeling like that. But then I realized like, Oh my God, that woman running from leather face and the whole family freaking out and screaming, how many people are secretly that woman inside of themselves constantly running in terror from parts of themselves that they can't deal with or acknowledge or look at.

Speaker 4:          00:45:37       And so, so meditation is kind of like going into yourself to that creepy fucking ranch house in the middle of nowhere in your heart and then exploring the places that you don't want to go into him up. You know what man? It's as it's feeling them, it's instead of cleaning or fixing or repairing, it's going in there and feeling the whatever it is. For a lot of people it's just grief, pain, sorrow, regret, regret, you know, and it's going in there and not being like, I'm going to fix what I fucked up seven years ago because this is not time travel. But what I'm going to do is for 10 minutes, five minutes, I'm going to let myself feel this thing that I've been trying not to feel by distracting myself with an incessant flow of thoughts and that that is, that is when you start lightening up a little bit because really all you gotta do is feel as they, I think the maps people say feeling is healing.

Speaker 4:          00:46:42       Have you ever heard that? No, but I think it have, but the thing was like a kid show. That's a great kid show. It shows him some good shit to do, man. We're on the ball. Yeah. Yeah. You know there's some kid's movies that are oddly psychedelic dude. Are you kidding? Like, oh, kids are psychedelic, like to appeal to a child. It's like you do have to create some crazy shit. You know what kids show isn't find me a kid show that isn't the most psychedelic thing, including Mr. Rogers. Like Mr. Rogers is like, that's some trippy shit going down there, man. Wow. Trippy. It's funny that you bring up Mr. Rogers because here's what, one of the things that I was going to say when we're talking about gun control

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       and violence and all the different issues in this world, what one thing that we don't concentrate on is promoting being nicer. Yeah. Like, no, no government official does that. Presidents don't do that. They don't get on TV. They sort of say it, we need to work together, but they don't. They don't ever say, folks, we just got to figure out how it'd be nice to each other like, do we not in conflict anymore, but we're designed for conflict and here's how you get rid of that golf. Get a fucking heavy bag. Go Run hills, go to yoga class, eat better. Stop drinking so much coffee or alcohol or sugar or whatever your, your vices. That's fucking with your body. Get you. Get your body in order and get your mind in order and just be nicer to each other. That would fix almost everything. If people just overall decided, you know what, Male, female, whatever the fuck, whoever you're talking to, just let's just be nicer to each other.

Speaker 3:          00:48:30       Yeah, let's just, everybody do this. Can we all just work on this? No one's saying work on this. Like there's no government officials. There's no big state of the Union address and go, ladies and gentlemen, our problems that we have with each other, ridiculous. We're family here. We're brothers and sisters and we're all immigrants. Every single one of us as an immigrant. I'm not saying we should let everybody in, but whoever's here, you made it bitch. He made it. As long as you're not a God damn criminal, you made it. Woo. So growth the tax dollars and get taxes from him. Also, don't forget we're all immigrants coming from infinity to, exactly. We're all immigrants who've come in to this dimension and have complete Amnesia as to what was going on for the last 13 out of a vagina. All of a sudden you're American.

Speaker 3:          00:49:12       Yeah, that's it. We're all immigrants and, and, and I hear about this. I can, I'm starting to run now, but I have to tell you, this does your, about this Canadian couple. There's a gay couple that a had twins and they did it through a surrogate and they, they mixed up their ges so that no one knew, which, you know, who's just was who's, well, one guy's an American citizen and one guy's not. Yeah. So the kids were born and they did a DNA test on the kids cause they wanted to find out whether or not one of those kids was a dirty Canadian. Turns out one of them is trying to sneak over our borders at one day old fuck off. So they set that little fucking terrorist back to Canada. Gay couple married in Canada sues US government for denying citizens to the child. Hey assholes. Let these fucking people come back. Jesus Christ understand man. Like people like jeff sessions see a picture like that and they feel like they're looking at somebody taking a dump on a crucifix. Like for a lot of these people, they can't handle the idea of gay people having kids. It's not like they're worried about citizenship. It's like a lot of these gnarled Fox who are running things. They're terrified of gay people. You know, that's, it's, I'm sure that you ever made that decision. It wasn't anything

Speaker 4:          00:50:28       to do with like, oh, this is citizenship laws. It was like, hey man, we're not going to have this futuristic shit where we're doing some kind of ges co Combos here. We're not doing TJ's combos. And my country just used

Speaker 3:          00:50:41       one of those little a paintbrush. Those things you stir with, you know, like if you want to make a butter coffee, here's a little blurb.

Speaker 4:          00:50:51       Oh, is gonna Lecture Electric Away? That's what they do. They just into like a mixing jug. How they use a fucking, they use like smoothie machines, man. They just, sure positive.

Speaker 3:          00:51:03       A buddy of mine was telling me today about, um, uh, he was in Berlin and when he went to this, there's this club and they had three different floors of this club. Like one floor was like a hardcore, like punk scene or you know, electronic scene or something like that. And then below it was a hardcore gay club. Heard of this class, hardcore gay club. They would have shit night where they would shit in the tub where and seal it up and bring it in there. They would just all over the stage and they would dive on the ges like a slip and slide and slide around on each other's Tj's they'd piss on each other and this is just,

Speaker 4:          00:51:40       well I get the ges and the pests, do you, but help me understand this shit. That tupperware shit thing. Like the problem is I opened up with the top worst shit. I went too hard off the gate. I should've, I should've dialed I shit. I should have started with Jizz on the deck and then they slip and slide then work their way up to piss nine each other and then these crazy motherfuckers started bringing in shit. That's what I should have done. But when I don't understand, it's like they're like the slip inside slide. It's like, yeah, you know it's like fucking fun night. You're like enjoying like some physical found with your paths, but like why are you bringing in like shit and Tupperware? Like what's the like smell and shit? They're like smelling each other's shit. So you're just like, hey, take a whiff of this great shit I had the other day.

Speaker 4:          00:52:23       Well, do you know how some guys like the smell of their woman's vagina? They want to get in there and smell it. You know, I wonder how much those connected, cause that's where you put your Dick. I wonder if you put your Dick and butts all the time. He'd be like, I want to smell your shit. Oh, like it's associated with light or reminds you of fucking or something. Mike, this is what I want you to do. I want you to shit a tupperware and bring it over. Are you serious? Jim? Want you to shit? Nothing. Bring it over and don't wipe your ass. Tupperware. Like why not foil? Hmm. Who knows, man? I mean you'd have to be really fucked up to want to smell someone shit. That pad. Yeah. Smell each other's shit. Maybe it's just like a naughty thing. Like we're being naughty.

Speaker 4:          00:53:07       Smell my shit. Yeah. Or I'm transporting shit like you're like I'm, I'm, I'm bringing shit somewhere. Like I'm bringing a lunch to this place. It's by the way, I've heard of this club man. My friend was telling me about this car. I don't know if it's the same club. I think it is. I've been hearing all this shit about bad ass. Berlin is man that it's just like crazy over there and that this one club my friend was telling me she went to, everyone stands in line. There's no VIP. Yes. Everyone stands in line like part of the experience of the things you stand in line for like a long time and there's one bouncer, he's giant. He's like this giant scary German guy. I think he's got like a glass eye or some Jesus and he's scans you so you stand in front of him and he looks at you and like does some kind of soul scan and if he decides you're ready to experience the psychic effects of witnessing dude's sliding through calm because you know for some feet cause it's not as though he's trying to like he's obviously trying to keep it cool in there.

Speaker 4:          00:54:10       Right. But he's also trying to keep people from losing their minds because like the one wrong person goes into the sub basement and sees a bunch of people huffing tupperwares shit and doing like do you know and the sliding through jazz, you know that could be like a push you over the line that could lead you straight to fucking mail bomb land. You could just end up in a cabin building devices of destruct that it's probably happened to kids. Then

Speaker 3:          00:54:35       if you took any of the people from the trump, he bear commercial and put them in that gay club while those guys are smelling each other's shit and Tupperwares and jizzing on the floor and pissing on each other cause they just wandered into their accidentally. They'd all start fucking probably. Have you seen that video? The trumpy bear? I put it on my instagram last night. I was watching tv in this fucking thing came on and it's like a tim and Eric Sketch.

The secrets zipper and bull out

Speaker 6:          00:55:37       that's actually getting one of these. It gets crazier. Watch on flag day and on any American holiday. God bless America. God bless. Trumpy dare. Trumpy bear suits.

Speaker 4:          00:56:33       Wait, hold on. That guy. Hold on. Hold on. This is fake. Did you see that guy's name? Is War a holic? That's frank. That's frank war. Holic like an alcoholic for war. Go back for bro Frank War. Holic that's a gag. This thing's a gag. Do that.

Speaker 3:          00:56:48       But it's on the radio or it's on TV rather. It's kind of a gag. I looked it up after last night. It is for sale. It a real products, real products. So, but so this is, it's a comedy sketch. I kind of knew it had to be. Yeah. There's no way it could be that bad. Yeah. Oh my God. I know what it is. They've made a comedy sketch that's comedy for people like anybody who's paying attention, but for people so dumb that they don't realize it's a comedy sketch and they, they think the way the people in the video thing. Yeah. It's like a honeypot for dumb dumbs. Yeah. It's brilliant because on one level it's like a really funny sketch. On the other level, it's just like people like God damn, I've always wanted a trumpy bear. So they make this bear, they sell this bear. They pretend that they're all patriotic and they just made the dump. Of course it is. What's wrong with me? I am the storm. Of course it's fake. I was pretty sad, but this is the world we're living in right now. I believed it was real because it is a real product, but when the lady pulled out or flag, I've got a little suspicious and then the other guy says, once a marine, always a marine. I'm like, this is a tim and Eric Sketch.

Speaker 4:          00:57:53       Pretty subtle man. Like I like it. Definitely. I've seen commercials that Shitty for sure.

Speaker 3:          00:58:00       Trumpy bear official. There he is. Once Maroon. Oh, a marine. Look at my boot. It's dirty because I work.

Speaker 4:          00:58:07       What do you, what do you think? You know, we're, we, we're, we make really shitty predictions whenever I come on your show about what's going to happen usually, but what do you think is going to happen with Mueller and trump?

Speaker 3:          00:58:18       I have zero idea. I'm fascinated by the whole process. I'm fascinated by his disdain for the intelligence intelligence community. That to me seems to be like in one of the craziest things a presence ever done is like literally have beef with the FBI to the point where the FBI foils a terrorist attack in San Francisco and the present doesn't even mention it on tv, doesn't praise them. Does it make a big deal about how good our government is that we've been able to stop these terrorists? This is one of the reasons why I wanted to build this wall in the first place and tighten up illegal immigration. Yeah. This is an opportunity to prove his point and he doesn't talk about it cause he's, he's got a beef, got beef with the FBI.

Speaker 4:          00:58:58       Do you remember when the FBI agent came to your show? Do you remember that when that happened? Yeah, that was one of the weirdest. That was like really weird for me. It was a weird, because the dude like the way he did it was perfect because he got like, it made my heart leap because he's like, he like, like he had his hand on my arm and like a cop style, you know what I mean? Like, and then he like lifted his shirt up to show his FBI badge. And I'm like, well, I don't know exactly what it was, but I mean, I could probably imagine a few things you might be arresting me for. But then he was like, then he was like really cool and he's like, listen to your podcast. And he's like, you know, he's like, he was just being really awesome.

Speaker 8:          00:59:41       Listen man, you need those people and everybody doesn't think they need those people. You have an unrealistic view of the world. You need sheep, dog. You need them. You need people to watch the criminals. You need two people to be able to solve crimes. You need people to be able to stop terrorist attacks like they did in San Francisco. You need them right and muddy dinks it. They don't need him. Look, I wish we didn't need them. I wish we had a perfect relationship with all the other nations and everybody just decided to work together for the survival of the species as a whole. And we weren't. So concentrating on a owning resources, taking over governments and controlling parts of the world that have, you know, things that we're trying to steal or get or buy. But it is so as long as it is, you're going to need the FBI, you're going to need intelligence, community, you're gonna need the army. You didn't need the navy getting these marines going to need the air force,

Speaker 4:          01:00:28       but don't the FBI, the police, the police like that. Br, the polices bullies

Speaker 8:          01:00:33       and that's, and there's a checks and balance system that's been proven. Now, I don't agree with this because I think this is a crazy reason to fire a guy, especially a guy who was a war hero, but General Patraeus, he his whole thing, he got busted because the FBI was looking into something. The FBI was looking into something and got the head of the CIA in trouble. So they go after each other. Wow. So there's kind of a competitive thing currently heared yeah, sometimes they don't get along. Sometimes the CIA and the FBI, they don't see eye to eye on certain things. But this one was a weird one because it was about an affair. It's like of all the shit that he did bad, like he had an affair. I just guys out there, right smashing worlds with these. What is the mother of all bombs with though? The fucker? He didn't lunch that one. That was after his time, but they launched all kinds of crazy bombs over there, right? I mean they're just shooting drones. The fossils. That's all good. I heard he put your penis inside of the wrong person, dude, that she lecture. It's crazy. Oh, we're going to investigate where your penis is. Pig. You dirty dirty boy in between killen strangers. You're out there. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:01:41       she's the wrong person. We can take all the accidental drowning deaths you got for us. We can't take as you shoot. Okay. Dirty, dirty semen inside another woman. You will only express love for one woman in this world that it, you can only feel up for one person at a time and you're definitely not going to put that general cock and anyone else. But Lydia Petraeus, your why. Oh sorry. So fucked up a function so fucked up. It's so sad. It's so stupid. It's scary. Like what? The guy didn't want to fuck his wife anymore. That's a problem

Speaker 8:          01:02:20       between them. Yeah. This has nothing to do with us. Is He still a good general? Nothing. Yeah, it's terrifying. I mean that's really where we enter into the land of absurdity because this is where it got really observe. Like you know people that think that there's some grand scheme to protect people and protect generals. A dude, there's video of him when he was walking from city college in New York where he's teaching and he'd have to walk down the street where he was going and the students were surrounding him, screaming at him, calling him a war criminal and he did it constantly is teaching there. Wow. Follow him from and he, and they're filming us for the cash of the cameras are filming them and then people around him like, fuck you, cute. And he's, he's on his own dude. He's helpless. If somebody just, they just jump them. They just jumped him. No one's stopping them. I thought people like that had like internal guards or something. Turns out, nope. Turns out, nope. No Shit. Cast that guy aside. I mean, I don't know if they've rectified the situation after that day, but that day he is by himself. Look at this. Turn it up. Give you some volume on. This is crazy.

Speaker 10:         01:03:27       It's crazy blood all over.

Speaker 8:          01:03:39       Hey, this hyperboles not necessarily holy shit. It's crazy to imagine that guy sexting sucks the fuck out at some lady. Ooh. Like a missile son at home. Here's a bunker buster. When he comes, he whispers scenario.

Speaker 10:         01:03:55       Ooh, Ooh, Ooh, Ooh.

Speaker 8:          01:03:59       It curls up back man. Let her see.

Speaker 10:         01:04:06       Hmm.

Speaker 8:          01:04:09       Yeah, they leave, but they left a guy alone. That's what's interesting. Then you would think that the, the amount of influence that guy had, the, the, I mean that guy was one of the top generals, if not the top general in the country, right? Wasn't it? Yeah. I mean he was a huge war hero. There's been two instances of shit like that happening. Where, um, the other one was the Michael Hastings one. Do you remember that one? Vaguely. This is a fascinating one. If you really want to fire up your conspiracy theory, really want to turn a pitch tonight. Michael Hastings was a journalist who, uh, was embedded, I believe it was in Iraq. It might've been an Afghanistan, but he was a embedded in the Middle East somewhere. And, uh, something happened. Oh, that volcano erupted. Remember when that volcano erupted? And they canceled all air flight for a long time. He was trapped over there with that and they got way too comfortable with him. And so they started talking around this journalist, the way they always talk and they, and he was joking around about Obama and make it fun of Obama and they said a bunch of shit they probably shouldn't have said, but that just what fucking soldiers say when they're over there risking their lights or something,

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       they probably don't even understand. You would want them to believe this is all for a good cost. Right? You would want them to believe everything that they're general tells them if they got a fucking crack, some jokes, the president's expense to alleviate a little stress while we're out there killing strangers. Yeah, no UN, an intolerable, intolerable, mocking the leader of the free world while you're out there killing strangers, you can't do that. So he made this guy resigned. So here's where it gets crazy. Michael Hastings starts telling everybody, look, my life is in danger. He's like, people are threatening my life on a daily basis. If anything happens to me. I did not commit suicide cut to him driving down, I think it was sunset car going uncontrollably fast slamming into a tree. The car exploding the engine flying from the car. Yeah, he's dead as fuck. They find amphetamines in his system. But that's adderall because that's what all journalists are on there. All on adderall. Right. So they tried it all the, I was on methamphetamines when he drove into a tree case salts. Classic job, Dick Tracy. Yeah, let's just forget about it. We connected the dots. It was quite easy. Meanwhile, there's people that have said with absolute certainty that with today's cars, it is incredibly possible. Absolutely credibly possible to control the car from a remote place and make the car do what you want it,

Speaker 4:          01:06:41       dude, definitely. Definitely, definitely, definitely. But we, I mean this is, I love this line of this direction we're going in here man, because you, it's great because it's like this to me where it gets really, remember that thing that people would always say that government is always, what is it five years ahead, seven years ahead.

Speaker 2:          01:07:00       I have it tattooed on my ass. Did you get it at a nightclub in Berlin? You got to know the government's ahead bro.

Speaker 4:          01:07:10       Huh? But it's true. It's true. All that money that they have. So where where it gets really interesting is when you start thinking about what that means in relation to like computer intelligence and ai and you start realizing like, man, whatever the shit is that they have access to at this point compared to what we think they have access to is so powerful and so dangerous that anybody who they want to take out, anybody they want to take out, they can take out. That's a problem. It's okay.

Speaker 2:          01:07:46       That's a problem. Having anybody to have that much power, especially over the rest of us. It's bad for them. You know, and Kennedy talked about this when he was in office, he talks about secret societies and and keeping secrets from people. And it's just generally, it's a bad idea across the board for humans. It's just bad for our human nature and to, for groups to have ultimate power of surveillance. It would just look into your life. It's odd. I mean, Edward Snowden proved it. It's, it's obviously, it's too easy. It's too easy for people that work there to check on the ex girlfriends who the fucking up. I just have one to read your email.

Speaker 4:          01:08:16       Do you think there is secret societies out there that we're not really aware of? Well, if they're secret societies that we're aware of, that's because someone along the line open their fucking trap. Sure. And they let us know about a secret society. That's how we found out about skull and bones. Right. One of those posts he's told their mom, yeah, you know, you made me sweat. Could dig. And they filmed. Yeah. No, I'm in the order. Isn't it like a glass coffin like glass Dick Saca glass, second glass Dick. I thought, no way. Not your way in a glass cottage is on you and they just on the glass, like you're laying down and you're looking up their glass coffin and it's raining jets. What if you do that to a guy and it becomes uncontrolled? Be Hard and just shoots in his pants? Well, I think you're naked in the glass coffin. Oh, okay. I don't know if they like put you in funeral garb or whatever, but my guess is like, I mean it was me. I'd be like, you know, I'm going to, I prefer to be naked. You're going to fucking splattered all over this fucking thing. I want you to be weirded out.

Speaker 4:          01:09:14       Let's go for it, man. I'm going to lay down face first. You just stare at my area. I'll try to come on the coffin from inside. Come on it from the APP while singing Abba songs. But, but do you ever like, I love thinking about this stuff because I do think that there is probably, and this is kind of what we talking about a little bit before where the maps don't work anymore. I think a lot of people like to live in a place where there's maps and they imagine that's all there is, but I'm pretty sure that there are sectors of society that you just never see and you never will see because they have around them. This impermeable wall of wealth, like you're not going to get in there like places that have membership fees that are like $600,000 a year. Like yeah, I know a guy lives in one of those uh, gated communities.

Speaker 4:          01:10:13       It has a golf course and the golf course costs a quarter million dollars a year. That because that creates this wall where most people Gannett get into. And then also that's crazy. People are living in compounds. People are living in massive compounds that have entire teams of servants. Like, dude, there's people who have eight nannies for their baby. Did you know that? There's people who have, it's because they're poor and they can't afford 15 like a normal family. Teenagers. You got all the different languages covered, the different styles you could have gained any straight. Danny sees the kid likes. But that's when you think about that, that there they're these enclaves of wealth that are compounds surrounded by not just like financial walls, but literal walls with armed guards standing around the walls. And inside these compounds are communities of, of a servant class there communities of servants that are having to serve these wealth, hyper wealthy people.

Speaker 4:          01:11:12       That's a king and a queen. It's a futile compound that's being separated from the rest of the world. And we're at least to duke and the Duchess of Duke and the Duchess. But I mean the pr, it's basically the no different. It's, it's the same fucking thing because a lot of the people working in there are illegals, so they don't even have recourse to normal laws and stuff like that. And so what ends up happening in these compounds is there's people who are untraceable who live in there. And that is when you end up in a fucking space suit, sitting in a Goddamn Tesla going and fucking Mars, it easily, you could put a disgrace nanny and that fucking thing. You know when they're really gangster, when they have white nannies, right? Pretty white nanny. Pretty white nanny. The wife has to sit around like there's someone who's always at CEC.

Speaker 4:          01:12:04       Always a check. Yeah. Husband, not quite checkmate. Always a check. Keep moving it around. Check. Oh, she conveniently dropped her keys in front of Luther. Yeah. Look at her. Pick them up the dirty bitch. God fucking crazy. I up in there. I want you to picks up the keys. Monogamy is so dumb. I believe I left these keys here. What Luther fucking nanny? What just left the nanny likes another cause. Then they might kill the wife. The wife knows too much. Let the wife join so she knows about the offshore accounts. What you have to offer. She knows about the taxes. Dude. She knows more than that. She knows more than that because, because what ends up happening in these compounds is you do start knowing things and you start knowing real thing. Yeah. You start getting the real downloads about like what's actually happening because these little fucking compounds, they're all, all those people are connected to each other and each other.

Speaker 4:          01:12:54       Christmas cards and they go to each other's parties and stuff and like they talk and they have and they know stuff. Man. The way luther looked at the nanny on bro, come on Bro. She dropped her keys. You really think she dropped her keys? Did you see that? I did see it. I heard, I heard. Yeah, I was there. She dropped the keys on purpose and she stuck her house right up in the air. He's getting a divorce. We gotta be careful here folks. You've got to keep this family together. Well these people sign like, he's like huge nondisclosure agreements. So like there, there's like they're wrapped up in a veil of secrecy anyway, but that's not what you have to worry about. Where you have to worry about. It's Harvey Keitel from pulp fiction. That's you have to worry about to worry about someone making a phone call and some guy who works at some fucking ray Donovan in real life guy who works for rich people who can make a lot of money. Imagine if you're friends with a billionaire and this billionaire is a, he's in a situation. Yeah, no, this is fucking guys. Just, you know, he's got pictures of my wife and yeah. You know, he's trying, he's trying to, he's trying to get some money out of me, man. I don't know what to do. Well, so we can make this disappear for a tidy sum of $200,000 Dun, Dun, Dun, and then all of a sudden that guy just isn't around anymore. Yeah. The guy just gets picked

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       off and you ever like would investigate it gets paid off and then it's like nothing happens that's just disappears. Just take him into the middle of the ocean. Well, it didn't, wasn't there just this billionaire Canadian couple that got executed. Executed in their house. Yeah. It's like shit like that and there's some sketchy deal. What would their connected to? It was the Clinton Foundation. Was it Jesus fucking Christ Jesus fucking Christ. Oh, Joe with you and your conspiracy theorists about the claim. Yes. It's all coincidence after coincidence, after coincidence and, oh, did you bring up seth rich again? Let it go. Let it go. No. Suspects shot in the back in front of his house. Four in the morning. No robbery while it remains, phone remains watch remains private investigator and he's the guy who gave up all the DNC leaked emails. He gave them up to wikileaks.

Speaker 3:          01:15:02       Nope. Just coincidence. Yeah. Muslim, nothing. He gave up the linked emails that show that the Clinton campaign absolutely worked their fucking black magic to get Bernie sanders knocked out. Oh God. Stop. Stop. Stop Dude. How about haunting man, but at that video again, put up that picture ends and he's showing me murdered Canadian billionaire couple barry and honey sherman. Several people murdered them. It says several. Wow. Wow. Crazy. That's crazy. They got whacked. Hey, they fucked up. It fucked up. What did they do? Didn't have a big enough army around them. They didn't have the army. Look at Duke and Duchess and you're going to hang out with assassins. Tried to save money on security. You know, if I was running a security team, I'd show them. I'd be like, take a look at these guys. They tried to save money on their security team. Yeah, right.

Speaker 3:          01:15:53       Okay. It says real to discover their bodies dangling from a railing near their basement swimming pool. I like that it says suspicious like, oh yeah, this seems a little suspicious. These billionaires are just hanging here. It looks like they were a strangled and they died from a form of strangulation called ligature neck compression. That means someone wrapped a rope around their neck and choke them. Gorat that is, that is a personal way to kill someone. That's very personal. Yeah. That's intense shit man. And these are old people, 70 75 years old. If you google that, it is not pretty pictures that you get back. I don't want people's faces that can print it out that Oh yeah man, you don't want that. Don't want that to happen to you. See this is the, this is why I think it would be scary like to be friends with a billionaire.

Speaker 3:          01:16:39       It's like it would be scary to be friends with someone way up at the upper ups because like you almost don't want that level of access. Like it's almost like, look man, you guys fucking do whatever you're doing up in your compounds. Drink from the iron skull. Come on the fucking coffins. Open the portals, pull out the squids. I'm enjoying my life down here. I really don't want to know. Like I, I would prefer to like to just speculate because here's the thing man. I'm sorry to interrupt you. Please go ahead. It, there's levels to everything, right? There's, there's levels to the weirdness that's involved in immigrant communities that all keep the same language. They all stay together. They huddle up together, their signs and their same language and then it becomes like a Korea town or a chinatown. The, I'll just huddle in that area and stay in that area.

Speaker 3:          01:17:26       There's weirdness to that. This weirdness to billionaires doing, getting together. We're all just going to do a billionaire shit together. Yeah. We're all going to hang out together. Any special clubs and those leather chairs, those with the buttons on them, you know, it's leather chairs. They're like smushy. They have like puffy and then the buttons and then little buttons all over him. It's a high back leather chair. Sit there and perhaps there's a little a nightstand right next to you with the cigar. Ash tray tap that will serve our ass and showed down and they bring over Cognac and you sift cognac like a gentleman and you talk about where you're hiding your money. You talk about a w, you know how you got rid of the syphilis before the wife found out? You talk about, uh, how you're, uh, you're helping to trump get into position to make sure that you could drill in Africa wherever the fuck you going to do it. This, this is what they do. They get together. How the fuck? Who else is gonna know what they're talking about,

Speaker 4:          01:18:14       right? And it's, and it's fucking generational. And some of them start going crazy. Like that cop, that cop boy, oh boy. Do you know the cop boys making those dumb shirts? If you seen that fucking, have you seen this shit? No. Oh Dude, you gotta see this? This is like, boy, this is the, is k o. C. H. This is the progeny. This is like the demonic antichrist. Progeny of like, oh, the Koch brothers. The Koch. Oh yeah. Cause it's coke not cock the god of Toy. Yeah, they're fucking cowboy. Dude, this is like, this is the, and this is what the antichrist looks like. Everybody thinks the antichrist is going to be smart and in like in like nefarious and focus like Demian. No Dude, he's gonna like make fashion shirts. Like look at this shit.

Speaker 3:          01:19:02       Let me see what we got here. Billionaire Air Wyatt coke makes shirts about money. I drank blood this morning. Wait a minute. It's the shirts are about money. Can you, can I see those pictures again? That looks like pink handcuffs with keys. How's that about money? Because that's what I paid for. Paid be handcuffed.

Speaker 3:          01:19:24       It's actually been removed. It's unavailable. Somebody got it

Speaker 4:          01:19:28       dude. It's the weirdest fucking shit everywhere.

Speaker 3:          01:19:31       He brings his whimsical ideas to life with his retina blasting shirt. Bray Wyatt Ingram. So why at Ingram is his shirt brand?

Speaker 4:          01:19:42       Yeah, but you got to look up an interview with him cause he says shit like daddy told me I could do whatever I want and I am.

Speaker 3:          01:19:48       Look at this chick ooze that his girl picked up bigger. God Damn, I prove I'm on his side. If a guy who looks like that can get a girl looks like that, you go, boy, what am I a man hater? Huh? Am I one of these asshole men? Shoot other men down. I'm not their guy. He didn't even bother even think once about losing weight. I'm not either. I'm just using weight. Look at my Zeros. I'm just using that as an example of the progeny of billionaires. Like these people are like, this is like something that this shit's spilling out of the mansions man. Like look at this says here, blessed this oafish coke air and his hideous shirts. He's a flamboyant guy and now we're talking about them. Good for you sir. I'm sorry coach. He's smart. He's, he looks like the guy who sold the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park. Remember the dude, what's his name? The guy from Newman Newman. He looks like Newman and he's banging a 10 I mean you get the fuck out of here. Also, it looks like he's been spending a lot of time in the skull and bones come coffin.

Speaker 3:          01:20:54       Aye. I, I'm not satisfied. I haven't absorbed all the energy of who come into my being. Who knows, man. It's just, it's just weird over there and on the, I look at him, I hope he has a giant Dick. I think that's the Dick and the left pant to the left pant where the yellow is like, it's kind of bulges out where the yell. Yeah, that's his cock. Giant fat. Like a quaker oats box. Scary. Scary. That's him coming and it's like, it's like one of these water bottles. That's what it's like. It's fat like that terrifying and the end of it, it quivers terrible seats like the demo gorgons mouth on stranger things. The end of it, it doesn't have a slot. It has like a little flower thing. That's the very end. Every time we do an episode together, we end up describing some form of alien caulk every single time.

Speaker 3:          01:21:54       Like I know, I know the last one we added a description of it. Yeah. That's scary. Very immature. How dare you? I think it's important to like speculate on the different types of potential. Alien Cox. I think Cox go away. I think cox or this is a temporary situation. 100% really? Yup. Yeah. I think that's what aliens are. That's when you see the aliens. They have no Cox, no Cox, no miles. We're going to get rid of this mouth communication. Going to get rid of this a cock and pussy. Fucking, it's horrible. No, no, no. We're going to mind meld. It's going to be like dmt every time. You're not even going to want to have regular sex. If you could, if I could give you the gift of being able to travel through space wherever you wanted to go, but you had a nub down there. You're Cox gone. No, I'd be like Doctor Manhattan just sitting on Mars by myself. I'll board. Fuck that. Fuck that. I like it here. He'd rather hump. I like America. I like being right here. Yes, Angeles. Goddammit. I like it. But you wouldn't want to see like float at the edge of the tiny little dick crying as I slide through infinity like this. Look it down and up. I have like a Dick, like memorable. They shrank Dr Ken's Dick and the the hangover. They've made it like so small. You couldn't even it. Remember that

Speaker 8:          01:23:06       would be what it was like. I know, man. If he's so sad. Yeah, and you'd live forever with no debt. No flying through space. Just a nub buck board. Listen man, I'm not into deals. I like what's going on right now. I don't want to hear you. Heaven deal. I don't want to hear your space deal. Yeah. Good. I'm good right here.

Speaker 5:          01:23:26       Well, I mean, don't you ever, I mean this are, and this is another thing we taught. We've done these so many times. We're going to repeat of course, but like dude, one of the, I do worry about you sometimes for him because it's like, I think you're going to get, I think it's finally going to happen. I think one of your fucking guests is going to come in here with a briefcase and he's going to show you something and I don't know,

Speaker 8:          01:23:45       like an alien piece of where the spacecraft was going to be. Tom Delonge. I was hoping he had something.

Speaker 5:          01:23:50       No, I think you're going to, you're, you're accidentally going to get access for some reason. I think somebody is going to give you something or show you something and you're in like I, I worry about you man. Cause it's like, yeah cause you've got like you now have a platform that is unlike any platform that's happened. You know, because you're doing like a comedy podcast, radio show style thing, but you're also interviewing people about really heavy duty Shit and sure. You like pepper it up with freaks like me from time to time. Just for it up. Yeah. But like you have,

Speaker 8:          01:24:25       you make it sound like the, the other people or the on the main agenda and mum patches pepper and up a little Duncan trussell. Well No, I'm just saying like what the fuck do I know? Like you're having people on you talking about you and I have had my all time favorite podcasts. Thanks. I haven't my all time favorite group of people. If I had like a handful of 10 people to pick forever, just do podcasts them forever. Yeah. You are 100% on that. I appreciate that. It's you and D as an Ra. There's a few other people callen but there's just a list of people that are just forever. Yeah Man, I love doing podcasts. You don't you ever say that? If it's between you and some fucking scientists want to prove to me that, uh, telekinesis is real. Go with you. Please take the scientist, then we'll do it your

Speaker 5:          01:25:06       podcast after. But Dude, I'm telling you, don't like knowing all this shit. And there's so many times when we've done this podcast where you and I have started talking and the elite, the hair stands up on my arm and I'm like, dude, like we, we shouldn't be talking about some of this shit. Like a, like a, like it gives me the real Heebie jeebies and then sometimes I'll admit this to you, sometimes when I'm super stoned, I'm thinking about all the podcasts we've done. Sometimes I think to myself, fuck ap Joe does know something like maybe you did end up getting some kind of little like shoulder, uh, with them where they're like, not literally your shoulder up, you just brushed shoulders. And they were like, Hey, we love your show. We love your show, man. They didn't even say anything. They just showed themselves to you a little bit to be like, hey look, don't fuck around man. Don't fuck around. Like you could talk. We don't want, we are funny. We liked the way you talk, but don't fuck around

Speaker 8:          01:26:04       man. Don't you ever think that? Hmm. No, because I'm not like you got dammit. Plus I don't keep those Cami ideas floating around inside my head. I got a Goddamn American flag behind me. Gun Control. The fuck you're talking about. I'm friends with a ton of cops. You got an American flag with a fucking cow's skull above it. It's actually an Asian buffalo from Australia. There was arrowed by my great friend Adam Green Tree. Wow. One of the best bow hunters on the face of the planet earth. Wow. He shot that thing. Yeah, but I mean it's like brought it to me remembering my friend, remember when we did that show, I remember we did that at this but it was kind of we is it. As the show progressed we became increasingly sort of despondent and find realizing cause we're both retired. Tell him that we here, maybe we were going to find an alien.

Speaker 8:          01:26:52       Like both of us secretly thought. It became very frustrating because you saw the same thing and everybody you saw this delusional belief in a logical things that they would argue. They would argue illogically the, there weren't objective about the actual evidence versus what they wanted to perceive the evidence to point to there. We're all biased in which I've been biased before. Everyone has been biased but it was just delusional. Everything. Everyone was delusional. Everyone from the first Ufo guy to the first chem trail got to the first big foot guy. They were all either liars or delusional or they had errors in their thinking. And then occasionally we would talk to a guy like that one dude that we met that was in the trailer that told us about the balls that would fly through the air. Yes. Well after that I heard a podcast with a physicist who a guy was a lightening expert who was talking about ball lightning.

Speaker 8:          01:27:44       They don't know what causes it, right? They don't know why it exists even. And this guy was that it was on radio lab and it was fairly recently, and this guy was actually saying that lightning itself, uh, doesn't make any sense. Like it's not supposed to exist. If you're measuring all of the energy in the skype is something that we don't know about what the formation of lightening is, that it shouldn't even exist. Shouldn't be possible. Right. But this ball lightning is not only possible. It's been observed many, many times and it's even happened inside of an airplane. What floated down the aisle inside of an airplane and multiple people witnessed. People have seen ball lightning, they've gotten video of bald lightning. And what it looks like. Is that exactly what that guy was describing to us that this thing came through his house and then just disappeared?

Speaker 8:          01:28:29       Yeah. Remember he's talking about totally remember and he did not seem like a liar to me now. I think he saw ball lightning and I think that area knew that skin Walker ranch place in particular is for whatever, whatever causes that phenomenon. It happens more frequently in that area. It's very possible because there are a lot of people over there that saw some shit share, man. I mean, but, but this, that was disappointing, but that was the most revealing. It was revealing in the guy. That was a weird area. Yeah, it was weird. There was a fucking weird area. But don't you like

Speaker 4:          01:29:02       imagine that? Do you ever do this game? There's a fun game or you start thinking about who the smartest person on the planet must be. Like the continuum of intelligence game where you start thinking like, okay, I know I land somewhere on the continuum of intelligence. I know there's people that are probably not quite as smart as I am and I know there's people who are way fucking smarter than I am. And then you start thinking of yourself, who are the, who are those people and what and what are they up to? And then you start thinking, see, this is what I think about. If I were you. Then you start thinking like, fuck man, I've got this podcast that lots of people listen to. Is it ever happened where maybe some really intelligent person has manipulated me and an attempt to get me to disseminate some kind of information out into the world.

Speaker 4:          01:29:46       Good luck manipulating me. Duncan Trussell, I'm an American. Flags don't run or something. What happens is colors at least know what's up, bro. But you wouldn't even know. That's the thing you wouldn't even know. I wouldn't know. How would I not know? These people are people we're not going to be like if they're, if someone is super so good at manipulating people that can manipulate me and it changed the way or think about them. Yeah, well then good luck. Right? I mean, but that's like the thing is like this is, again, I'm not trying to make you paranoid or anything, right? It's just, but it's fun to think cause it's like this like, okay, like let's imagine for the sake of just fun, we established there these fucking billionaires and they live in these compounds and they, and we've also established that certainly people like mice thing, Michael Hastings and other people, they get killed all the time.

Speaker 4:          01:30:34       Might have, but I think you got killed because he got a fucking major general fired. Well they what? What did we establish their general during, they're super powerful people who will use technology to kill people to have their own way. So that means that there is some group or a series of groups of people that are you doing or like highly nefarious actions from a place of power. I'm just paranoid. Or you're not connecting the dots here. Maybe he was on speed and drove into a tree. Then the honestly I do not know. But the, his very fun. Yeah. To think that it's a conspiracy and they killed him. Very Fun. But if you look at Ockham's razor, you know if you applied ockham's razor, the most likely scenario is that he just drove into a tree that's not very sexy. Here is a way to kind of help out with Ockham's razor with these kinds of things.

Speaker 4:          01:31:21       It's just think, okay, I have $100,000 and I'm going to put bets and this awesome casino where the truth is revealed. So are you going to put the money down on him being assassinated? Are you going to put the money down on him being on speed and driving into a tree after he said, if I commit suicide, it's not a suicide. I got to meet the guy. He might that might've been thrown people off. Get to meet him. Maybe he wanted to leave a fucking story. Maybe this guy's like, you know what? I'm just going to have these people think. Did I got fans, man? Shit, ah no, no dude, I

Speaker 8:          01:32:00       know where you'd put your money. I know where I put my money. If it was like 50 bucks. Yeah I'm going to bet on conspiracy cause this is deciding if I lose 50 bucks, I won't feel that. I feel like wow fuck hoes is hoping to win. But you're like, I'm just saying man, how do you deal with being on the fucking radar man? Because like the thing is like if there, if there is an interest in controlling the pair and the reality tunnel, like we know that there is a Wa like truly a award to control the paradigm because if I can control the paradigm just as a cool thing, this is, I agree with you, but I don't think it's a united front. This war to control the paradigm is most tightly fought between left and right. It's most tightly fought in, in government.

Speaker 8:          01:32:42       Right? In the real things. Well we're doing is commentating on the sidelines. Yeah. You know, if I'm an influencing anybody, I'm influencing people by pointing them to information that I see that's already out there. There's a big difference between these people are in power against each other, right? There's gotta be some people that are influencers that get access or get shit upon, especially in the age of trump, like if you're an antitrust and me, if he finds out you're against him. He's got like, he's very vindictive. Like he calls don lemon a moron, and he shits all over those CNN host and call CNN fake news. But Sean Hannity and Fox and friends, he'll praise them in his tweets. Like there's an information war going on with these people, but they're paying attention to right and left assholes like me that are like, what am I?

Speaker 8:          01:33:27       What am I? I'm a fence sitter, you know? I mean it fucking, Ron Paul was running for president. I'd probably be like, I'm in, let's see how this works. Right? I like what he's saying. I like his ideas. He, he was, he was a guy that when he was running for president, I was like, okay, well this is, this guy's clearly a very honorable person. He's clearly a very honest person. I mean, by all accounts. Let's see what he does, what he does. Let's see what he does, what happens. Let's see what that, it's gotta be better than just knowing you're being bullshitted. So many of them are just so obviously bullshitting you that you're listening to. These can fucking speeches and you're like, God damn it. I don't resonate with you at all. Right? This is that presidential type of address where I talk in a way that you've never heard a normal person talking in your presence before.

Speaker 8:          01:34:11       You might say to yourself, well, that's weird man, but I got to talk like that when there's a lot of people now you don't. You don't. That's not real. And I don't understand. You put a shield up and the shield is a an act. You have a presidential act. Sure. Or you have a strip club Dj act, right? Well, you have a morning Dj App ride five o'clock past the hour. Here we go. Led Zepplin houses of the holy, the ocean, Dat, Dat Dah. Yeah, I mean that's the fucking voice. I've heard that voice a thousand times. It's a goddamn costume that people were, you also have a fuck voice. Don't forget that. I don't have a fuck boy. So you don't, oh, come on, let me put it in. Talk like you wouldn't fucking crazy.

Speaker 3:          01:35:01       Do you? You, um, you don't have a fuck voice. Come on. Sorry. They won't hear my voice. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:35:17       It's time to fire. You Do, do, do. There's so much shame and wanting to fuck. Ooh. She wants to fuck itchy vagina or vagina needs it to get scratched. Yeah, man. It's one of the, definitely one of the tragic parts of society is that people feel shame about that. I love the scene in game of thrones when Cece, what's her name? [inaudible] the beautiful darcy. Thank you. When service, he's walking naked down the street. They're going shame the shame bell shame and the shame bell APP on my phone. I used to, you can get the shame about lap. Whew. Yeah. I don't have any more. Why is it too much? Having too much power. We're addicted to the shame factor. People delete their facebook off their phone. I know people that like regularly delete their facebook. They fucked us. They just take it off their phone.

Speaker 3:          01:36:07       I can't do this anymore, man. Too much power with the shame bowel man, but people, there's a lot of dudes. You ring that fucking shame ballot girls all the fucking time, man. It's the worst. Yeah, you're ruining the whole vibe. Yeah. Well you know what it is. Cause guys feel terrible when a girl leaves them and fuck somebody else. If they want to make it like very difficult to write new man. Right? Sex more than one man. You've dirty little bitch. Yeah. Yeah. Or if you're like not of your polyamorous, then like the yoga, they call you a cock because you don't care that other people are fucking hippy talk for when you move to Cuba or wherever the fuck. I don't think they listen

Speaker 10:         01:36:45       in America. You get a fucking wife and that's it. Greedy Bitch is an even number of people over here. This ain't China son want to go live in China has this like fucking 10 guys, 10 guys

Speaker 3:          01:36:59       guys, everyone check. You're going to wind up but fucking other dudes. Oh well fuck it. Yeah. You say come coffins all day, baby. That's what happens in prison. People get crazy. They start having sex with men. You just gotta. You gotta figure out a way out of prison or having sex with men. Figure out a wig. Gotta get rid of your, come comes, got to figure out a way out. What's the best way your hands are going to have to fuck guys or something? Shit, this is bullshit. That's, that's what happens if you live in China. That's what happens. If I don't have real, real lesson here to learn, but if there's more than 10 to one men to women, well don't they have, they have some crazy problem over there. I'm not making this up. They have a prick. Joking folks. Obviously I'm joking, but there's a crazy problem over there with, uh, the ratio of men, women or is the ratio. Let's take a guess. What is the ratio of men to women in China? I meant like 60, 40. It might be bad news. It might be higher. That's danger. Might've made that up. That's a dangerous,

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       it's a spooky ratio. I've read the ratio. It's not a good ratio. Spooky fucked up ratio. Well, you know, for the long time they had limitations on how many children you can have, which is just fucking take gen x. They messed up the whole thing. It's not just that man, people were killing their baby if they found their baby was a girl. I mean, this is a real thing. It didn't happen everywhere. It didn't happen all the time, but there absolutely were girls that were drowned because they were girls because the family wanted a boy and if you don't think that that's the case, you're delusional. I think you're delusional. I think if you put those kind of restrictions on intensely poor people, in some of them, in some parts of the country, they're in terrible poverty and you tell them they can only have one kid.

Speaker 2:          01:38:35       They don't want to have a boy because the boy is going to help them work. Right. I don't know if these stories of them drowning baby girls were true because I wasn't there. Those stories persist. Sherry ever snope them, but I don't think they know either. If you weren't there, what happened? Brutal. Fuck. It's a horrible thing to think to have a baby and then just drowning. He's, it doesn't have a deck, but two people have done that. People have left babies and garbage cans. I mean people have done a lot of terrible things to babies. When I was a kid, I, um, worked at a place called Newport creamery and it was right next to a bank and a girl that worked in the bank was pregnant. She never told anybody she was pregnant. She gave birth in the toilet and left the baby in the garbage.

Speaker 2:          01:39:15       They found the baby in the fucking garbage dead. And she got arrested. And this was a girl I used to go to. I used to go, she was a bank teller. I would go to the teller. She like, she was, she seemed awkward, you know, she was at Carnegie dates or anything. No, I did not. She wasn't checking and she was a large woman, which is why nobody could tell that she was pregnant. She was big and um, she apparently had been pregnant and didn't tell anybody. And nine months pregnant at work and just had the baby in the, in the toilet and threw it in the trashcan. And I don't know if she didn't take the trash out. I don't know how she got busted. You imagine going into the bathroom and you're taking a shit and you're like, why does it smell like baby in here? Because that smell and then you look into the wastepaper basket. You see an I gotcha.

Speaker 3:          01:40:05       That is so fucked up. So fucked up. That was a real person that I knew. The country with. The highest gender disparity of birth isn't China. What is it? Lichtenstein. Oh, where's that terrible, sad play. Okay, let's find out what the ratio of men to women. It's the same about 33 million more men than women. So it was like 733 million men and 688 or something like that. Okay, so it's like nineties. That's like in the nineties isn't it? Says Christ. Man, that's crazy. It's still a large number. Thank God for sex robots. They're going to better though. It's better than I thought it was. Um, within 115 males. Every one. Go ahead brother. 115 males to every 100 females. China isn't the country that most store. That's crazy. Imagine if you're in a room, there's 115 dudes in a hundred girls. It's like a crazy chair thing.

Speaker 3:          01:40:54       Like, Shit, I've got to find a cow. That's one's worse. Where and linkedin sign, it's 126 males to every hundred, but there's only, there's less than 40,000 people in the whole country. So it's even worse. So the cause the cause there's less, less possibility. Fuck man. Magic. There's a country that that's a crazy country. 37,000 people. That's a crazy country. That's that. Countries like Burbank. No, it's not even burbank. Yeah. No. It's like, what's 37th that, let's take a guess. A part of La has 37,000 people in this Christ. 37,000. That ain't, that's nothing out here. Like boulder is 100,000 in boulder seems so quaint. That town is one third the size of boulder. I mean that country has one third the size of boulder. That's amazing. Wow. When you think of it that way. That's amazing. As many people as in culver city, I imagine if culver city, he was a country.

Speaker 3:          01:41:53       Whoa. Beverly Hills is 34,000 that's amazing. So it's beverly hills. It's beverly hills as a country with all dudes. That's amazing. With all dudes, just like Beverly Hills, that gay couple things satisfy. Fuck. Imagine people have a real hard time with the idea of gay people raising kids. They get real angry. I just can't think that all gay people are the same. Why would you not think that some gay people would be good at all kinds of things? There's going to be gay people that are great carpenters. There's going to be gay, like gay people. Just like straight people is going to be awesome ones and it's getting me ones that are fucked up. The idea that they wouldn't be good parents. Wouldn't you rather have two gay parents that loved you than a a mother that's a fucking crack head and a dad that's piece of shit beats you to gay people that let you be yourself.

Speaker 3:          01:42:46       You know, just they're, they're cool and conscientious. They just happened to be homosexual. They love each other. They hug in front of you. You realize like, we're all wrapped up in this bullshit of, you know, men and women, Chilean be together, heterosexual people like ourselves. We get weird when you think of someone who's homosexual, like I'm fully in support of it, but when, if they started fucking right in front of you, but like, hey, I got go. Whereas like if Dunkin started banging his girlfriend right in front of me, I'd be like, do you want me to cheer you on? How you want me to handle it? Just watch. Okay. Don't look at me when you come though. That last time was weird. I was just like, look over. Oh, ah, make eye contract. They, but it's like, I, uh, I've seen guys kiss in public and a part of me is happy for them. Pardon me? He's like, that's awesome that they're so comfortable in 2018 now 17 at the time, maybe even 16. I seen him a couple of times. What had one time I was driving and uh, I was going from the comedy store. I took. Right. And then I went down. Is it

Speaker 8:          01:43:52       doe Heeney which treat is it? One of the streets that goes right to Santa Monica Boulevard, which is like full rage, gay central. It did just dude's in the streets party and there's this big gay club with guys on Poles and shit and this is two dudes and they were hanging out and they uh, there were belt Lupin. We're like, they each had their hands on the other's belt loops, like, like anchoring in and they were just grinding on each other and kissing. And I was just, I was in my car. I was like, oh Jesus, Jesus, deep moving. Don't stop here. I was like terrified. I was like, the car was stopped and they were right there. Like belt looping and making out,

Speaker 5:          01:44:32       okay. Simulator. You have access to any experience you want and you're in it for, I don't know, a hundred thousand years. You're like some in a mortal being how long before you simulate fucking a dude joe? Well, you know what happened? Marlon Brando. Yeah, he fucked prior eve also fucked Marvin Gaye. What a roster. Wow. He's just really into talented black eyes. Yeah. Wow. But you're not answering the question. Oh, I'm sorry. In the simulator, how long, how long before you started having sex with you or you decide to have sex with a guy like in a simulator, it's like the, for like 10 thousands of years you're having, you know any kind of you can, you, you can literally fuck anybody that you want in this simulation and you're, you're in there for a long time. So you go through fucking every single possible iteration of woman ever. You just fucking fuck it three ways, six ways, thousands of ways. You're, you're like, you're just laying in a rain forest of, of beautiful pussies squirting on you and fucking, and everything that your mind could think of sexually. You're just doing it. How long before you start adding coq into the equation? Well, I think if we did an experiment where we

Speaker 8:          01:45:45       both took a journey like that, where I'll see you will be just like we are now, but it would be a hundred thousand years of whatever you want later. Yeah. Okay. We'll show up hundred thousand years. Now. You will have dick on your breath and I won't, I would've gone to the whole hundred thousand years with no gay sex cause I could do whatever I want. Why would I fuck dudes? I would have sex with girls and then when I was done having sex with girls, I would take a nap or I do some other shit. Meanwhile you'd be like, I got to stick it somewhere. Maybe true man. Yeah, I would, uh, I would get to the finish line and I'd be like, no dude, finish line. I'd be like, yeah, made a hundred thousand years, hundred thousand years. That's the race. No Dick for a hundred thousand years made it right. Cause Your eternal he is. He does have girlfriends, man. Why would you start sucking Dick? Well, it's about that time who look at your watch, but after a couple of years, like posted a couple of months, come on man. Why is a hundred thousand years

Speaker 3:          01:46:50       any different than 20 years did 20 years ago? You feel less likely to suck a Dick and you feel today? No. You, you're the exact same God damn human being other than you've learned and gotten better at life, your desire. You still like the same shit. First of all, I want it, I just want to go back over it. Cause you said at the end of the hundred thousand years, I, I've, I've to him, I had a breath. Here's the thing in my simulator and my simulator Cox are going to like have different flavors. It's not going to just be cock. It'll be like an owl toy. That's how they get you. They get you by Minox. I hate to say this to you, but you dicks, um, you dictates terrible and you need to get it. You'd get it. Mentee, there's way is a way and then guys are going to suck it and then they're going to get meant in their mouth.

Speaker 3:          01:47:31       Just like if I, if you suck my Dick, you get mint in your mouth. You want to fill it, just let it just try it. I don't, I know it seems weird, but it'll get your mentee. I will fully admit that the end of the hundred thousand years, I have sucked dicks in the sex emulator, but the fact that you think you haven't, I would like to do a poll, like I'm going to get to the end. I'd be wearing a cowboy hat, bare chested, that's riding a horse of fighting off with every fiber of my being, but I make it, I don't want my bare chest and I'm bare chested with a Bandana. Like I'm close, I'm close. I'm shaving my chest with a straight razor and the front mirror at the barbershop. I'm super close to go and gay, but I don't. I make it to a hundred thousand years clean. I have cowboy boots on with no socks. You lose the race wrong. I fucking, when I don't have dick on my breath at the end of the race and I don't have those dirty memories either. You have dirty, dirty Mary's idea of butts and shit and Tupperware and slip and slide with just stopping with, I'm suck enough dinosaurs.

Speaker 3:          01:48:36       That's right. You could have anything you want. You can. You can but fuck a unicorn in the sky. Yeah. Why not? If you could do whatever you want, if you can do whatever you want, you would like full chart. Like if your life was a virtual experience that you can control with your mind is if you have a control panel, you would just start talking decks and Ami. I'd be bulletproof robbing the banks. I'd be fighting vampires. I didn't make a whole world. I would do a bunch of shit. I'd fly, fly all over the place. It wouldn't land. It's suck a dick. Yeah. You know, if you ever heard the Alan Watts thing about this, you ever heard Alan Watts to talk about this? I'm going to talk about a lot, but not about that. Did he really know? He talks about, he does this great thought experiment, which is like, okay, if you were able to do anything you wanted, right? You've definitely heard this, but you, if you were able to do anything you wanted, if you are an infinite being omnipotent and you can do whatever you want, you would experiment with making everything and you would try everything and you would do everything. We're talking about infinity. You're, you're literally in the state of creative flow for infinity and you're going to do, he has a great lecture that I'm going to butcher. You should look it up cause he's so, he's such an articulate genius. Like the

Speaker 5:          01:49:47       essence of the thing is eventually, eventually upon crew doing everything and creating a universe and creating planets and creating a planet where there's life on it and being a God that communicates with the beings on the planet, you're going to start thinking to yourself, I wonder what would happen if I made myself one of the beings on the planet and couldn't remember that I was God. And that's what you are. That's what we are, is we are one of the experiments of the divine seeing shit. I wonder what happens if I forget that I'm capable of creating anything that I want, whenever I want, that I've made the entire universe. Let me turn myself into this hyper limited version of myself with no memory of what I was in. Play that game at that level. Cause it's a lot more fun. It's amusing. It's exciting. Right. And that's, and, and that's when Alan Watts starts talking about which cox he would simulate inside that machine. No, no. But yeah, it is.

Speaker 2:          01:50:44       You ever heard of Marshall Mcluhan speak? No. His, there's some interesting youtube videos, um, on, um, with the, you could watch Mcluhan talk and he doesn't look at anything like you'd expect. It's really interesting. But his, uh, Kalki not in a non one say, calculated his scientific dissection of like what's happening with media and what's happening with technology and where the future lies is so fascinating because it's from the 1960s. Yeah. And you know, he's talking about the media is the message I think is the name of the lecture and the book. And that was the same book where he wrote one of my all time favorite quotes that human beings are the sex organs of the machine world. Like this guy had no internet. He had, I mean nothing was like anything too in the bet. And most electronics they had, it's a goddamn calculator and it had nothing to computers.

Speaker 2:          01:51:37       They have were giant rooms filled with shit. You know, like, yeah. But somehow or another he saw where it was on Cohen. He was seeing things and and pointing things out just with the very nature of our ability to communicate in our ability to innovate and where it was all headed. Yeah. Fucking fascinating cause you think about how it did play out and no one saw this common man. All right. But no one saw common was what we're on right now. Right. Internet, this fucking new thing where people can just find out the answer to like we've done so far today about scientific questions about descartes car. Yeah. Can periods that these, this was constructed and when did this happen? And 1,079 what? You know you, you're, you're, you're getting a download like anybody that's ever lived. Yeah. It's amazing. Everybody can do it. That this is the thing that's making the boundaries between us and the leaders of the world.

Speaker 2:          01:52:36       This is why there's such a problem is because we have all the information too, right? Everybody has all the information. Yeah. And the only thing that's keeping it all glued together as tradition, the only thing that's keeping the hierarchies into the position of power, they're out right now without being completely abandoned and restructured from the bottom up. The only thing that's keeping them together as tradition, that's it. What do you mean? The only thing that's keeping government and just borders and nations and the whole concept that were existing, that there are a bunch of different countries and there's a bunch of different leaders and this guy controls the, sure, sure, sure. The only thing that's keeping that together as tradition. The only thing if, if we eventually can communicate with each other in a way that for goes all of the current limitations and all the past limitations, something that bypasses all that stuff it takes, one of the first things is going to go is the illogical traditions. But, but it seems like its traditions being guarded by dudes with guns. They are, but those dudes with guns are going to die and new young dudes with guns, you're going to take their place. This is just a, I mean it might take generations, but this is what happens with ideas. It just happening so fast now and some of the people with the old Id, they were born and raised with the old items. They're still around. They're still stuck in this old sistance. Right. But then this new system has blossomed around. They're trapped shitting

Speaker 5:          01:53:57       bricks. They're shitting bricks and they're trying to stop it. Exactly. And they're actively trying to stop it. Did you hear that shit? Jeff sessions said, I don't mean to keep harping on that guy, but he, he, he, he said that like he just came out again saying that he thinks that the opioid epidemic as they call it, is being partially fueled by marijuana is a gateway drug that uh, marijuana is getting people on a painkillers, which is a completely raw, it's not, I mean, not only is it, is it wrong, it's like they can show statistics that seem to indicate that the opposite. The opposite. Yeah. But that crazy fuck is saying it publicly. Like it's real and it's not. And the too, just the fact that like, that man is allowed to continue having his job, which theoretically somebody who was in his position should be so hyper aware of the data on all drugs because a person in that position, we need a person just like you were saying, we need shepherds like this fucking fentanyl shit, man.

Speaker 5:          01:55:05       I, one of my friends, he lost his, his, his wife to this. So I ended up so many people are dying because of this. Like we know a couple people that have died from it. It's terrible. It's Tom Petty. It's so sad. It's terrible. But we need, so we need to have some regulatory force. It's making sure that these poisons, but they're not regulating that they're going after the stuff that's the most safest, the most beneficial. Medicinal. Could you imagine having a podcast with Jeff sessions? Is You sitting across from Jeff sessions for three hours and talking to him about things? Dude, I've heard and this is like, I hate this. I smells like salt. I hate

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       to say this. I don't want to say this. I've heard he's like funny and he's like, likes to argue and he's cool out with. That's what sucks. Yeah, you want them to be like smelly. Say that. But if you had him on a podcast, I bet you chip away through all that. All those, that party personality, no, these people, this is a problem, man. These people, they're not lizards. They're not lizards. That's a problem. If there were fucking lizards, if only jeff sessions was a fucking lizard. The problem is it's like they're not like that. They're just, they're confused.

Speaker 2:          01:56:15       Yes. Mass does sessions. Podcast is one. Thank you. Father. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Know, the problem is we have to have compassion for these people because they're not bad. They're misguided and they're informed and they can be turned around with the proper experiences. Right. And if they're willing to abandon their previous notions, but the problem is so many people are so invested in their identity that it's impossible for them to give up. Their notion is just like the Egyptologists. I don't want to look at the possibility that may be there've been doing these fantastic constructions in Egypt a lot longer than we think, which is entirely possible. It doesn't mean that the great pay, I mean take it back to Egypt one last time. Like no one's doubting that the Great Pyramid of Giza was constructed at somewhere around 2,500 BC according to the previous or all the data that we have right now because they've been able to carbon date stuff that they find like in between the stones.

Speaker 2:          01:57:08       They're pretty sure that it's somewhere in that range. You know, they're off here. They're a little bit, but there's some other construction that John Anthony West pointed out that's buried under sand. They find that's like wait, like it might've been buried for who knows how fucking long. And it's a different style of construction and it looks really old. Like one of the things about the styles of construction and the things that they find in, in, um, in Egypt is a lot of it is buried in sand after why even the Sphinx itself, you know, when they found the Sphinx. And one of the things that one of the people that is in, uh, some of the ancient hieroglyphs, it's attributed to being alive at the same time as a scroll. I forget which pharaoh, but he heard in a dream that if he uncovered the Sphinx, that he would become pharaoh of Egypt because it was covered in sand, like to, he had written down at that time and this was like 2000 bc or something crazy like that.

Speaker 2:          01:58:01       It was covered in sand then. Wow. They don't even know. I mean there's so little they know about you made it and why you know the answer to this. How, and this is probably a dumb question, I'm sorry, but not deep as the sand out there. Like how far down does that fact? It's a very good question. That's a very good question. When does the sand, here's the other thing is in San from oceans beating down rocks. Yeah. I mean that's what sand is. Yeah. This, that's what's the most fucked up thing about the desert. There's, there's no goddamn ocean, but you've got so much sand. Yeah. That is mostly from, what isn't it? I think sans mostly created, it's probably created few different ways, but I think it's mostly created by oceans beating down rocks. Right. So that's just time. You're just looking at time.

Speaker 2:          01:58:50       The craziest fucking stamp of time. We can look at it. Yeah. How long does it take for an ocean to turn rocks into a Goddamn desert? Holy Shit, dude. What is under this is Sam Mega Lake. Oh, I need the sands of the Sahara desert. Scientists have discovered evidence of a prehistoric mega lake. There's a monster down there using images of wind blown sediments, sediments produced by running water and bedrock seen by radar beneath the desert sands. The geologists piece together, the profile of an ancient wow. So goes the sand goes 69 to 141 feet in the Sahara and three feet in the Simpson desert. I don't know where that is. The depths of sand varies widely around the world. And I know 141 feet. Wow. 141 feet of just sand. So am I right? That sand is created by the ocean beating down rocks. I think that's true most of the time of maybe it's not true all the time. It's so nice to be so stupid that you just ask.

Speaker 5:          01:59:51       Sounds Fun to figure it out. Like you get to know, like it's great. No idea.

Speaker 2:          01:59:56       Yeah. I was, um, talking to a Neil degrasse Tyson the other day and he was trying to explain to me, um, uh, escape velocity like any, he takes my shoe, he goes, let me see your shoe and he takes my shoe and he goes, now if I throw this up in there, it's going to come down. But if I throw it hard enough, it will escape the pull of the gravity of the earth. And once it's free, it'll go on forever. Yeah. You see it? They're like, wow, that's fucking cool. Yeah. Like he tried to like put that in your head like, wait a minute. What

Speaker 5:          02:00:31       goes on forever? Isn't that the problem? Now this it sky, this is great to just dummies talking. Yeah. Isn't this the problem with the moon is that not the problem with the moon, but if you jump on the moon, you can escape the escape. Like it's easier to get out of the escape velocity. The moon. No, it's one six. Earth's gravity. Oh really? Yeah. I thought we started on the moon. You can like, no, no, no, no, no.

Speaker 2:          02:00:54       Can theoretically you can jump higher. And if you believe in NASA, bro, there's some videos of guys jumping around on the moon. Yeah. The problem with the videos of people on the moon is that there are videos that look 100% fake, but guys fall forward and it looks like they get yanked up by wires. There's a lot of video that looks fake as fuck. I don't know if it's fake. I don't know if it just looked fake because it's one sixth of the Earth's gravity and we don't know what that really looks like until you see it play out. But there's some videos of guys falling down face first and getting yanked back up. It looks like the yanked by court.

Speaker 5:          02:01:30       Have you seen that picture of that thing that looks at Jamie? What after we talked about this last time, some people send in videos of an NFL. Players do the exact same thing in the end. Yeah, super

Speaker 8:          02:01:40       athletes. It's three or four guys doing throw their body, but they don't have a giant pack on their back. And when wearing helmets, they're wearing helmets. That Shit's light compared to what the astronauts are wearing. Dude, astronauts have like a once in a suit that keeps them grabbing a drink concept is the suit. If there, the concept is they're not even on the fucking moon and then that suit, it could just be paper Miss Shea, but some of the ones where they're pitched completely forward and they just go badly what it is. I'm trying to find it right now. Yeah, I would love to see it. That's interesting. So you, you're still wavering on whether we went to the mint. I'm more weight. I'm numb. I'm too dumb and uneducated to really know. Right. But I am wavering more on the possibility that some of the footage was faked super quick. It's a five second videos like no. Interesting. Go ahead.

Speaker 11:         02:02:23       Boom.

Speaker 8:          02:02:25       That is not the same thing Jamie. I can do that. Super similar bull shit. I can do that. That guy goes to, I'll do that right now. Find another one. The guy goes to his knees and then uses his momentum. The pop up from his knees. I've seen some that look pretty crazy though, man. Dude, that's ridiculous. The moon ones are way more preposterous. Better examples in that though. There's super athletes. Yeah. What they're doing is springing up and you can see the kinetic energy from their legs. It's forcing them up. They're super athletes, right? They, they show off. Those guys do back flips and shit all the time there. They are physically capable of doing things in a normal person cannot do, but they're not physically capable of defying physics. What you're seeing in a lot of those moon videos looks like someone's defined because it's like they pitch forward and they bounce back up.

Speaker 8:          02:03:09       I think they shot a bunch of shit and I think some of the video, if you're going into space and you're experiencing deep radiation, the van Allen radiation belts and from the sun did, you can't even go through the fucking x ray machine at the airport, the old x ray machines with film. They wouldn't let you. Cause if you went through with Phil and would kill your fucking film, so how are they getting these perfect videos and photos and none of them are fucked up by radiation. It's entirely possible that they did go to the moon, but they faked a bunch of the film footage because they wanted to have something and they couldn't really bring anything back. It's entirely possible. There's fake footage from the Russians. 100% is a precedent. The footage of Yuri Gagarin when he's circling the earth for the first time and he goes on a rocket and the first guy in space, it's fake as fuck dude.

Speaker 8:          02:03:53       He's inside this tiny little compartment and all sudden there's, they've got ruined there for a camera. Get the fuck Outta here bitch. You See a light source this way, the light source. That way he's got dueling shadows behind him cause they got lights set up in there cause they're filming him inside this capsule. No, he shot up in the space. You really did do it but they couldn't fit it. Bad damn camera in his tiny little capsule. Right. It's, there's no room so they just faked it after the fact. Make sense? Of course it makes sense. A lot of money. There was no internet back then. There was no vhs tapes back then. They broadcast something on tv as far as their eyes and their mind goes, that was the only time people are going to see it. Right? All they have to do is show it to you once, pull it off.

Speaker 8:          02:04:33       Nobody ever imagined you'd be able to pull it up on your phone or to stoners like you and me. We'll be watching on a podcast. It's even find the video of Yuri Gagarin from inside his, what would you call those things? Pods. Pods, which call it Yuri Gagarin in space. You Watch it. You go get the fuck Outta here. You watch it and you go, what? That is fake. That is not him or this. Not Him in space rather. So your nose and blast off. Here he is. He's getting on the bus studies. Headache to space. I can't believe it. You're ready? Show me where are you? Right, so he's in this state. Look at that. I didn't back it up. That was it. That's it. Watch this. Are we good? We're good. We're going to strap up. How am I go and turn off to look at the lights? You see, hold up, back up, back up, back up. Stop. Pause it. Leave the shadows. Shadow to the left. Shout out to the right. This is fucking lights in front of them.

Speaker 8:          02:05:35       They would lights in there. He's in his tiny little cat. This tiny little pod. How's it lit up? No, maybe they just have, I don't want, I mean it's still windows. Why couldn't they have lights in there joe? Because they've got no room had it seems like there's enough lights back then. Think about these candles. They campfire you fire in there. I saw a few breakdowns of the moon landing two that said it would be way, way, way harder to fake it back then than it would have been to actually just, I read that too. Yeah, I've heard that too, but I don't think we're talking about faking going to the moon. You're not understanding what I'm saying. We're talking about faking footage, not talking about faking going to the moon like I think they probably did go to the moon, but I would imagine that at least some of the footage you're seeing is horse shit. From what I, I wasn't obviously alive then. It was like a 140 minute live stream.

Speaker 8:          02:06:27       No, no, it's not. No. If you, if you just have people in orbit, it wouldn't be hard to fake. Look, I think it'd be harder to go there. That would be to fake it. I think going there, if they did go to there and I think they probably did was an unbelievably difficult thing to do, but like thinking that they were there, how hard would that be? Like? Like after the fact like filming footage. We're filming footage of them in orbit and is the part you can't, that would have been a mile of film Joe. It's really interesting. Why do you know that all that Shit's missing? You know all the original footage is missing. That's the weirdest fucking thing, man. Yeah, I know you're doing, you're being skeptical guy. I looked it up. It's missing or a bigger one that only that you know what else is missing but telemetry data, all the ones and Zeros that show the location of the capsule or whatever the fuck it is on the waist.

Speaker 8:          02:07:16       I thought from what I read, they still have that data that just the original like paper, it was on it. The original magnetic tapes got reused because they needed to. Okay. Well why would you say that? Unless you just, why don't you just google it and find out? That's what I read. I read when last time, you know, what'd you read? I read that that original tapes got written over because they needed to magnetic tape because there was a shortage at some point. Right. So but still, but the date is still somewhere else. There was a short, they recorded over the original tapes of the fucking moon landing. How much of a shortage of magnetic tape do you have? Where are you going to record over all of the video from the mother fucking moon landing hank it. We got a presidential parade from 76 you want to keep that?

Speaker 8:          02:07:56       Yeah, Kate, that keep, that's a good one. It's like if you're going through like your family's vhs tapes, like what do you want picnic from 82 yeah, that was when Mikey threw up. Save it, save it. They're saving everything, but they record over the fucking moon landing. Let's just fucking record over the first time in human history. Literally the craziest thing in human history to ever record. Oh, it is the dumbest thing in human. I'm not saying they didn't do it. They might have, the official story might be legit casino, but it might not. Where do you put your money on the moon lighting? Because you know what? I'm detecting Joe when we first got to be friends, as I recall, you didn't really believe in the moonlight. I didn't believe in it at all and then you went through a phase because if the podcast and having a lot of conversations with different people or something happened where you started shifting your ideas and thinking, we did go to the moon.

Speaker 8:          02:08:49       No, I started shifting my ideas about everything. Or Moon landing is just an example. That's an extreme example of a position I took that I think represents there is there is mystery to that story. Yeah. There's a lot of mystery to that store is still to this day. There's a bunch of weird shit connected to the moon landing a lot of it. So when I, and people are like, no, there's not shut up. No, there is, there is. There's a bunch of weird shit connected to it. How about the fact that they give a fucking moon rock to a, was it the Prime Minister of Holland, uh, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins signed on this plaque and they gave this moon rock to this guy in Holland and it turned out to be petrified wood. It was fake. Like it's, there's so much weird shit connected to the moon landing that it makes you go like wow.

Speaker 8:          02:09:38       Right. Creepy speeches that Neil Armstrong gave 25 years after the moon landing, talking about uncovering hidden truths, patrice protective layers that are, you know, oh great deeds that could be done to those who could remove one of truth protective layers. This is a speech that he gave. There's so much weird shit. Some people say there's alien relics as people. Ridiculous. There's no evidence to that. But there is evidence that these people are talking really weird about the moon landing. Jamie, can you peel a clean set? What Clinton said in his book, he wrote a book called my life and in one of the chapters in my life he talks about a conversation that he had been a carpenter when people landed on the moon. He was working in a construction site and the guy said, I don't believe it for a second. Those television fellers they can fake anything. He says. Back then I thought the guy was a crank, but after eight years in the White House, I was starting to think that maybe he was ahead of his time. Now this is what bill fucking Clinton wrote in his book, my life.

Speaker 2:          02:10:34       Wow. Why would the fuck would you ever write that if you were the God damn president of the United States for eight years and you're saying, hey, maybe the guy who thought we didn't go to the moon was right, might not be right. It might be that they faked some footage. They did fake some photos. There's a photo of micro Colin's who's on a moonwalk from like Gemini 15 and it's not a real photo. It's a photo of him from the test runs that they did. It's in a warehouse and it blacked out all the background. It's been proven. They reverse the image and blacked out the background. You could see the two of them, if you overlay them line up perfectly, it's the exact same image, right? So someone, whether it is a, uh, you know, an overzealous pr agent for NASA or a journalist at the time who actually made that photograph, but somebody did and tried to pass that photo office space.

Speaker 2:          02:11:26       So there's some deception. We know that one is 100% sure. So then you look at the other ones, you look at the videos of guys falling down, getting yanked back up and the bouncing around like they're on trampolines and some videos where they're hiding behind the lunar rover. Like, what the fuck are you doing? If you guys tear your suits, you're dead. Sure you guys are jumping around on the moon. Like you're having a party up there. Is that real? Right? How come I can't get a fucking regular camera through the radar machine? The extra mission at the airport? But you guys can fly through the radiation of space and that should comes out, but what will, those cameras were insulated. There were different kinds of camera. The camera is not true. Housel bad said it. They were the same God damn cameras. It's a regular camera.

Speaker 2:          02:12:06       There was no specific protection. There's nothing unusual about the protection that those cameras had. It's interesting, man. You've like gone back. No, I haven't. I think it, this is the thing, man. I'm not taking any position. You're agnostic 100% because I don't know anything about space. I don't know anything about the physics of space travel I go to, I don't know anything about the requirements of technological requirements, but I do know it's one of the only things that happened between 1969 in 1972 and it's not cheaper, easier and faster to reproduce today. It's weird. It's a weird spent a year. It's a weird thing. This is the only time in history. People have been more than 400 miles from the earth's surface was always moon missions, all the Apollo missions, man, everything since then, all the space shuttle stuff inside 400 miles satellites, you know, like a space station.

Speaker 2:          02:12:52       You talk to people about that part and they'll say like, we just don't need to go there anymore. Maybe we don't. Maybe they're right. Maybe they're right. They might be right. We don't know. But it's juicy to think they're not right. But it's interesting how rapidly people fight off the notion. Here's the other weird shit about the Nazis were running our space program. That's a fact. Operation Paperclip, Varun Navon promise a fucking Nazi. They brought all the scientists over like legit Nazis who would hang Jews in front of their fucking rocket factories in Berlin. Git guys who were, we're tattoos from the Holocaust, identified Wernher von Braun talked about him being in there. That was the head of NASA. That was the guy who was trying to get us to the moon. Yeah, dude, there's a lot of

Speaker 3:          02:13:32       weird shit and now you're getting deep

Speaker 5:          02:13:34       bend to it. It's the Nazis doing some kind of thing where they're like trying to fake the moon landing like at some out get to attach to the Nazis.

Speaker 3:          02:13:42       I think the Nazis were the best rocket scientists available. Right. Or one of them other than the ones that we had here and then the ones the Russians had, there was a lot of competition to get the best rocket scientists but some of the best rocket scientists were in Nazi terms. Sure. So when Nazi Germany fell, operation paperclip took place and in Operation Operation Paperclip, they brought a number of Nazi scientists from Germany secretly to America. And one of them they put as a head of fucking NASA.

Speaker 5:          02:14:09       Yeah, this is where the, this is where it gets really cool. Someone was explaining all this to me about how basically it's the thing is like, okay, you think in World War II that we just rounded up all the Nazis and they just disappeared. And it's like, what do you think are the Nazis went and they bought the ones who were really good at making cool shit yet we'll bear aspirin. You know, like the, the idea is that the nar aspirin. Yeah. Well look up. I'm so sorry to ask Jamie, but do you mind looking up bear as brandon psych on be like and, and, and, and the Jewish slaves? I think working for bare aspirin, but when you look at like a lot of the core, the idea is that the Nazis didn't really go anywhere. They just started corporations and some of the biggest corporations we have right now. Or

Speaker 3:          02:14:51       do you know why Zyklon B is I clumby because icon beat took the smell out of it is I climb a, was the stuff that had a sea, an agent in it that made it smelled terrible so you could smell. So when they used it to gas, the people in the concentration camps, they changed it so that it was a undetectable. Yeah. Did, did you, what would it say? What does it say? Jamie is quick with the trigger here today, getting frustrated with us changes the camera. So if you guys aren't the Bayer Aspirin company is finally apologize for the inhumane acts of its parent from including using Jewish slave laborers during the Holocaust. Holy Shit. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:15:27       And there's all kinds of examples of this and where it gets really weird is like this is, this is one of the great conspiracy theories is I think the Bush family is somehow wrapped up in it. That's where it gets weird. It's like the, it ends up getting wrapped into American politics. It's like, Oh, do you think that the Nazis just became rocket scientists? Do you think they just know they became pharmacists, pharmacists and they started running the companies and corporations and then like they, and they're still here and their descendants have lots of money and like to think that they went anywhere is nuts. The Nazis didn't really go anywhere. They just went deep into hiding. They just sink back into the immune system of society. Like you know like the way aids hides in different parts of your body. They just hid in the shadows. And this is one of the reasons people are freaking out about the kind of like um, friendly emergence of some people who are like clearly white nationalists who are just kind of like being like interestingly accepted and embraced for, you know, what's at least have a rational about

Speaker 4:          02:16:30       how you want to start a white ethno state. You know, that kind of stuff because it, who's doing that? Well, I mean, isn't this something Richard Spencer talks about it, but who's taking that guy and talking to them rationally? Well, there's these, a lot of these people are getting like a lot of airtime, but I think this is a bit of an exaggeration. You're like, maybe we're talking about Steve Bannon. Steve Bannon got into the White House and a lot of people state their name is, but he has, he, has it been proven, I mean it's really easy to call a guy and a white nationalists. Has it been proven? I don't know much about Steve Bannon. I don't know what, honestly, I think a lot of, I think, I think some of these people, it's, I think it's like God, I mean, you're going, I'm going to get like a fucking, I'm going to get like an avalanche of like you're a fucking guy, tuck, Tuck Kami.

Speaker 4:          02:17:10       But I think like for example, when you look at trump's reaction when they were saying asking about the KKK and he's like, I'm not going to talk shit about this group. I don't really know him. Remember that like, or the fact that a lot of like, I think you're paraphrasing. Um, he, I think what he said was, uh, a little more acceptable but still weird. Can we look at it? It's like a little tip telling. It's like if someone's like, Hey Kay, Kay Kay, what do you think? Well, he's also said something about there was people bad behavior on all sides, on all sides. And that's one of the, one of the white nationalist groups picked up on that and said specifically that trump didn't criticize them specifically. So this was a good thing. The whole thing was very good for them. It's like a white nationalist groups said that, but that could have been just him just not doing a good job preparing.

Speaker 4:          02:17:57       What are you going to say about something and talking off the cuff, which I think he does with most things. I think that guy does most of his shit off the cuff. Yeah, he, you know, he said that and one of the things that he said, but in the wrote that book, the art of the deal, he doesn't make plans. He just goes, it just goes to work and gets things done and just work. Work off of instincts. I don't know. The thing is like, it's generally like when you think of certain people, right? Are they a white nationalist? Like when I think of you Joe, are you a white nationalist? No. Right. It's simple. It's simple. It's like there's no like, well you know what? Even a nationalist, I love America, but I'm not a nationalist. Exactly. Yeah. So the problem is with some white what you don't want.

Speaker 4:          02:18:37       This is one thing I don't want, I don't want there to be a blurry thing. When people think of me about whether or not I'm a white nationalist, you know what I mean? Like I don't want there to be a like, well maybe he does have some kind of ideas that are based around the importance of upholding European culture and making sure that we do everything we can to prevent people from having sex with people from other races. I don't want there to be any question, but like I have zero problem with everyone humping everybody whenever they want mixing the Paints and doing whatever. There is no question. I don't care. Like I think it's fine. Whereas some sounds like what a racist would say. What do you mean? Trying to like divert attention away from your racism. I said, what the fuck you're doing? I see what you're doing, man. This is virtue signaling but virtue. Oh,

Speaker 3:          02:19:28       do me a favor. I hate to dwell on this one more time, but you please go. I want to make sure I'm right about this, that the hassle bad cameras from the moon landing weren't insulated in any bizarre way. See that up there are set. They were different cameras. They were mates a specialty while they were made for this chest thing. They also had a special special film developed developed by Kodak Special Film. Is that true? Because I read that it was exact same film. Who but who says it? Who says it has a big breakdown? I'd look it up. It had a pixel, which is a big cause too many fucking, there's too many different people commenting on it that like, like me, like I'm muddying the waters myself by not exactly knowing what the fuck I'm talking about. Well Dude, I mean that's, I look at the camera or behind the historic w what is this?

Speaker 3:          02:20:08       Who wrote this? Had a pixel. This is a pretty well, this is fucking shell to shell site. This is CIA front. Even the shadows, the lighting, the lighting. Why is it so well lit? It's in the shadows. God dammit. There's a guy behind it with one of those big reflector booms. This is on in Nevada. There's a tarp back there. And uh, if you look real close, you could, uh, see gum wrappers, films, listen, look at all that gum wrapper and fake round. We've got fake that ground looks, oh no man, look at that. Look at it. Shitty tin foil on that spaceship. Yeah, super likely. That just landed on the moon. It's just more fun. This is why I abandoned the idea that we didn't go to the moon. It's more fun to think that we didn't go to the moon. It's more exciting. So I have to be careful going that way.

Speaker 3:          02:20:53       That's why I changed my opinion on it because then I started really looking at him like, what the fuck do you know about space travel? Almost zero. But what do you know about bullshit? I know I'm the law. I'm good at bullshit. I know about bullshit. And when I watched that press conference, the Post Apollo 11 press conference of Mike's Samoans, but bullshit shit, something's weird here. And I think it's entirely possible that they were forced into, uh, accepting some stuff that wasn't real in, they kind of knew it, but that they probably did go to the moon. I probably don't understand how you're, this is like get back and forth in your head. When I say alien artifacts on the moon right away, you're like, no, I don't think they leave shit behind. I think if they're smart, they uh, they clean up. Have you not seen the clean up fucking rack?

Speaker 3:          02:21:37       There's a division of alien. No evidence they'll look the face on Mars. We've looked at women really well. Picture of that space ship that crashed on the moon. Oh yeah, that's true. That shit looks crazy. Of a real, I like to think that you space ships. I think they get to a certain point, they just traveled through dimensions. I really do. But think of that more and more. I don't think spaceships exist other than like the really crude civilizations like are relatively, oh, that's super real. Which one do you mean it's most drawn with crayons? What the fuck is that? It's roaming. That's an episode of Star Trek, Bro. That looks like a ship, like the eyes of a mountain line behind it. Come on, man. The eyes look at this is a fucking volcano. Look, look, that's a fucking topographical map. That's you're isolating a tiny little area and you're choosing to look at it.

Speaker 3:          02:22:24       You got to ship. How dare you. You could look at anything in Moab, Utah and decided that that's a space ship. This is why they don't want to go to the middle ground. It's the fucking ground. There's a hole in the ground that's a ship. It's not a ship. And look at that trail. It's like a bobsled trail. You know what's interesting? We look for Shit on the moon or in space in general, and a normal thing in space is fucking amazing. Like if we find a microbe on the desert floor, no one gives a shit. Oh look, your lives in the sand, it's incredible. Nobody's going to pay attention. But if you find something in space and you can prove that this thing exists, it was a living organism, a primitive organism that's on Mars. So we know that some life existed on Mars. Right.

Speaker 3:          02:23:07       And then take it another step further. If you ran into some dude who was jerking off in your apartment building, you just open the open the wrong door and some dudes in there jerking off and he's screaming and he's an old man. He's got a tank top on. What the fuck can you tell your friends? We'd laugh at it, but if you found that guy on the moon to some old Dude Jurgen off on the moon, imagine if that's what we found. I went to anyway, go crazy. Realize you realize like like that. We literally are in a simulation and this is how we find out. There's a guy on the moon jacking off and he's got boxer shorts on and socks with crocs and he's just sitting there. He's probably knuckles up, right? He's sitting there with a hunchback knuckling up on the moon and he got dirt, but he's got mouthfuls a dirt.

Speaker 3:          02:23:48       That's how he gets by. That's the creator of the universe. He's just gone crazy. The creator of the universe went insane. Now he just jerks off on the moon. Oh, it's an old man. He looks just like an old man. She was like, the universe is so infinite. There's an infinite number of possibilities that lives can exist. Like someone's explaining this the other day, that the infinite is so vast that literally it's entirely possible. There is a darth vader somewhere like a real legit darth vader who runs an empire. Like it's real thing somewhere. That's how many possibilities exist. So if that's the case, why can't there be a possibility on the moon of an old dude who eats dirt? He's got a tank top and spaghetti stains on it. He's knuckling up on the moon. Nah, Nah. We find them. We have to film them front page of the New York Times. They found an old manager and off of the moon.

Speaker 3:          02:24:33       Do you think they tell us if they found an old man jerking off in the moon? It's like that's what they find. Like the space probe lands and then right in front of it's like fucking look at this guy's great ball hair. He's, I'd love see this left press conference, half his guts hanging out, spaghetti stains all. How do you give it spaghetti stains on his shirt and no one knows. No one knows he's eaten dirt on the moon jerking off on the probes. Now what? Now? What are you going to do now? What is our civilization to, how do we deal with this? Well, it's the same thing. It's like this a elon musk car in space. It's like you see the image of that car flying through sprint. You're like, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait, is this real? Is this really going on or am I in it? Goddamn movie, right? Like what's happening here? It's just got to really spend $100 million a shoot a car and it space. What the fuck is this? Sure, he's got a camera on it. It's broadcasting images of a mannequin. Find what the fuck is going

Speaker 4:          02:25:24       on, man. Cascading levels of absurdity. That's what's happening. We're seeing cascading levels of absurdity and like the more that it, the more that absurdity happens, the more normal it seems. Yeah. And that's kind of I, this is what I've been thinking is like what, what the apocalypse really looks like because everybody thinks when you think about the apocalypse, when I think about the apocalypse, I think of media, yours, volcanoes, the classics, you know the ocean dying of like just cataclysms right, right. But really it's like more like absurdity starts avalanching into time to the point where things start happening so quickly that we can't even catch up. Like now we gotta deal with the fact there's a fucking tesla infinitely flying through space. If it slams into a spaceship that's coming to visit us,

Speaker 8:          02:26:15       fucking a man. Could you imagine it was like the alien overlord. So like they're finally ready, let us visit and they come in at light speed and then the moment they read merged from lightspeed, Tesla comes through the windshield, hits him right in the face, takes the head off the emperor and it's just fucked. Just explosions. Just like in Star Wars. Boom, boom, boom. Laura dern is at the wheel holding on or turn around. That's what happened in the new star wars movie. Spoiler alert. Remember when they hit warp speed, they went right through that one jet or that one.

Speaker 4:          02:26:52       Yeah, that's, that's probably going to happen, dude. Or it hits a meaty or it hits a meteorite that wasn't going to hit earth and then knocked the trajectory so that it does. Yeah. I think, yeah, there's, there is now. Elon musk kills us all when this stupid fucking car flying through space. She has his fucking car out. Just grazes and asteroid clink and it just, yeah,

Speaker 8:          02:27:17       right towards La.

Speaker 4:          02:27:18       Yeah. We don't know, man. It hits the laugh factory that's been the center. That's the fucking main place. It smashes. Make God laugh. Yeah. It's two side of 18 semis and it hits the laugh factory.

Speaker 2:          02:27:37       No one can hear. No one can hear it, so it's so loud. Everyone's ears explode, please. No. If you're nowhere near it, your ears explode. If you in Kansas, if your ears explode from the impact you're never hearing ever again. Ever. No one within up

Speaker 8:          02:27:52       5,000

Speaker 2:          02:27:53       mile radius ever hears again.

Speaker 4:          02:27:59       People in The Bahamas, like what? What? What was that? Yeah. Yeah. That's crazy. Hey Z,

Speaker 2:          02:28:09       the earth rings for a million years. That's fucking crazy. They sent, when the earth got hit by that one that hit the Yucatan 65 million years ago, it rang for a million years just to drown. Just like it got cracked like a gong for a million years do. That's fucking crazy. You ever heard the descriptions of how deep they think that thing was in the earth within the first second of impact? No. It's something bananas like a miles deep into the earth within the first second of impact. That's how big that thing was called Manhattan size chunk.

Speaker 4:          02:28:51       Yeah, man. I love that because that's reality. Isn't that funny? That's the funny thing about existing on the planet is because everybody walks around imagining that the world that we're living in is permanent, permanent and stable and not just our world aren't just society, but your own life. Like people walk around through their own fucking life. This is the thing I was thinking about that uh, that terrible. It keeps happening but the Amtrak train crash. Yeah. Cause it's like when you think about that you're just going to work.

Speaker 2:          02:29:21       Why do you use it? Here's the thing that disturbed me the most, and this disturbed me a lot lately. This is a real issue. People that were on the left were saying that they were happy that it happened, that God had done something to kill these politicians because there was a lot of right wing. Oh yeah. G O p people that were on his Amtrak thing. Like could you imagine just saying that, not, not, not only thinking it, but saying it on twitter, like you're so confident. Show your righteous with your desire to have strangers dead in a horrible fucking train accident. Yeah. Like somebody died in that accident and they're like, great. Going to herb and someone's Dad's dead. Yeah. Right. Someone's mom be of was a male or female at died, but someone's mom dead. Someone's sister dead look good. Good riddance them.

Speaker 2:          02:30:12       God had a plan for them. Fuck down. Like, cause they're on the other team. Yeah. Dude, that shit does terrifying. That shit's really sad. But it never used to be the left. That's what's the scariest thing to me. The left was never like advocating violence. They were the exact opposite during the hit, the, the Vietnam War, they were the hippies. They were the people that wanted to bring the troops home. They're the people that didn't want war. They didn't want violence. They didn't want to hate. They denounce tate. Now they're, they're like, they're like talking about violence being the answer. I see certain certain political movements. I punch a Nazi.

Speaker 4:          02:30:46       I saw a term on reddit that I liked a lot called liberal baptist. Have you heard of this? So basically the idea is like a, you know, like in fundamentalism of any sort really. Like the idea is when you're saying that you're religious, it's you're, you're not really interested in another person's soul or saving another person. What you're interested in doing is creating an ethical hierarchy that you can dominate by being at the top of the ethical hierarchy. Right. So what you're running into with this that you're talking about is people who don't really seem so concerned with how society is supposed to be as much as using their refined system that they've come up with, which is like, they call it being woke or, you know what I mean? It's like, it's this rough, crazy, it's hard to even keep up with it, but they use it to try to dominate the people around them by making you scared to speak your mind.

Speaker 4:          02:31:44       Because the idea is it's like, you know, like I, one of Mike the guests on my podcast that I get fucking yelled at more than anybody else for having on Jordan Peterson that really pissed a lot of people after I had him on my podcast because they feel they misunderstand him and they think that Jordan Peterson hates a transgendered people, I think. Or they think that he's a, uh, I think that he's, they think that he's like, all right, they think that he's like some kind of outright spokesman. And the truth of the matter is I don't, I don't fully know all of Georgia, the spectrum of Jordan Peterson's views on things because it would take me a very long time to do that. I know he's fucking smart. I know it was really cool for him to call my podcasts and I know we had a really great conversation that didn't really talk about that stuff, but it didn't fit the narrative that they want.

Speaker 4:          02:32:37       The narrative that they want is that he's a hateful person and then he hates transgender people and that he's a bigot and then he's just right wing outrights poster boy, but it's not real. The problem is people aren't willing to adjust that once they stand on that stance, once they have that position that this is, I'm left disguise right way and he's a pig, he's ruining things like that. They just make up their mind. But can it, can we throw it, let me add one thing to this. Imagine this. Imagine Jordan Peterson and I don't honestly, I don't know, but just imagine there is a piece of him that doesn't for whatever reason, like it he, I don't know. I'm, again, I'm not saying this as an I have no, I'm not implying it either. I'm just saying imagine fucking short Jordan Peterson. I don't know. I'm trying to think of some offensive thing that he just imagined he had some piece of him that was definitely politically not correct.

Speaker 4:          02:33:31       Right, okay. That doesn't mean that all the other shitty saying is invalidated by some piece of him cause people are made up of lots of different pieces. Well that's basically in a way, I'm not categorizing Jordan Peterson the way you categorize descartes, but that's what he was saying. Right. That with great people, they all also have, what was the word? He used a not great sin but great. What was the word? He used to remember the word, the expression. He ain't got shit. They've got shit gun shit. Yeah, the great flaws as well as, and I this, this, this devices. That's what he said. This is to me where the big fucking problem is, is that people have lost the ability to be nuanced and people if and, and that to me is where things are really fucked up right now, which is like you were throwing the baby out with the bath water.

Speaker 4:          02:34:22       And I'm not saying like, oh, let's give a platform to people who have like hate speech hate. Yeah. But, but the idea that we have gotten to the point now where just like free balling and throwing around ideas, just like we've done all over the place here, I guarantee you when I look at twitter, there's going to be at least like five people being like you fucking piece of shit. Only because like I'm throwing around ideas because my hope is through that process, I'm going to get closer to the truth and I'm going to be able to look at myself like what you said about the cock, the coke boy. You know what I mean? I liked it because you're right. And I like what you did, even though his comedic is funny. You're right, dude. Why am I giving that guy a hard fucking tax you're going to do?

Speaker 4:          02:35:05       He can't not be born a cookson. Right? It's, he's like you can't change his birth and his who he is he doing? So he taking over countries in Africa. I know he's making cute shirts and he's banging a hot woman yet. Hello. I'd so that's to that. But I liked, I liked that having these kinds of interactions with friends because it helps me adjust even though I don't have any real animosity for the koch brother from that kind of thing. I can look at my own fucking pattern and be like, whoa shit. Yeah, that's like a, that's something to think about cause I like, I could be more compassionate there. So my point is what, what, what ends up happening and what leads to someone who started off being [inaudible], who's a, who considers themselves part of a group. There was true that's trying to stop war.

Speaker 4:          02:35:45       That spawned the hippie movement and now they're like thankful that a train accident happened. That is a result of gradually shutting down their ability to understand that a human is much more than just one fucking thing. Jeff sessions is not just an anti marijuana person. Jeff sessions is probably an elephant, an elephant as sweet at that and a person who's got a lot of love in him and he's done a lot of good things for a lot of people, but also he's got the worst fucking concept of what marijuana is and that sucks. But that doesn't invalidate any of the love he's expressed throughout his life. And this is unbearable for some people to deal with because we want a darth vader. Well, it's because we are inclined to gravitate towards tribalism. It is a part of being human being. It's always going to be a part.

Speaker 4:          02:36:37       It's the same reason why those egyptologists were rejecting these ideas from John Anthony West. Robert Schoch cause they weren't a part of the tribe and these new people coming in with some shit that they didn't figure it out on their own. There's a thing that people do on, whether it's male versus female. You're seeing a lot of this when it comes to this me too stuff. One of the weirdest things that happens is that you start to getting this divide where the men are men and the women and the women in the matter of the men. Even people that are non offenders and and non victims. They shore up on teams and yes, it's good that people are being exposed for doing bad things to people, but it's also very dangerous for us to just be men and women be on opposite teams. We're humans, right? We're supposed to be nice to each other.

Speaker 4:          02:37:16       It's, it goes back to what we were talking about earlier. We, we don't say that enough. I really don't think we say it enough. I really think we need to, it needs, it should be reinforced and it sounds like, oh, it's a fucking growth thing. That's your advice, Bro. Be Nice to each other. Yes, it is. My advice. It's not my only advice. I think you should also get your shit together. I think you should have some fucking discipline. I think you should eat right. I think she'd do a lot of things. You should read books, they should pay attention. I think he's tried to educate yourself. I think he's tried to be aware about objectivity and tribalism. Where are the influence. But I also think it would be really nice if we all just agreed to be nicer to each other and just have it as a conversation that the country has and then ultimately the world has.

Speaker 4:          02:37:55       But that list of things you just gave before that. Yeah, I think that all fits into the category of being kind to yourself. And I think that the way you're going to learn to be nice to other people is by learning how to be kinder to yourself and being kind to yourself means treating your body better. And that's loving yourself. And like this is actually one of the things this Guy Jack Kornfield taught me, which I like a lot cause I was talking to him about, man, you know I want to fucking get in shape and like I feel bad cause I want to be more in shape. And he's like, okay, but the way you're talking about it, you're hating yourself right now. Yeah. Don't get in shape because you hate who you are. Get in shape because you love yourself enough to want to feel better and to what?

Speaker 4:          02:38:37       So saying that it changes the way I'm looking at it. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Like you just saying that I'm like, yeah, all right. Yeah, don't hate your body loving by getting it healthy and then by loving you, that's loving your site changes the intention around from like, I'm going to destroy my fall myself and replace it with a better self. It's like I'm going to love this being I am right now and the way I'm going to do that is by, you know what? I don't need to have five beers a night. You know? I don't need to pour the booze into the thing every night as much as I have been. I don't need to smoke cigarettes or I don't eat whatever the thing is. And that attitude of like, I'm not doing this because I am not doing this because I hate myself.

Speaker 4:          02:39:16       It's just this is a different ways of me too, for me to express love into my own world. And then from that it radiates out. That's what you did. I mean that's what you do is like part of what appeals I think. And and you that appeals to people is that you're sort of radiating this like way of being that offers a lot of people a sense of like, oh shit, I could probably do that. I could probably do that. And it draws people in. So this kindness that you're talking about, it's contagious. Yes, it is contagious and it should be, and it's our cultures operate on the momentum of the people that are in them. Right? Nazi Germany is a good example. So it was Denmark, so it was Norway. I mean it was really interesting cultures that are very different from other cultures. China's very different from a Ethiopia. I mean we vary widely in the way we behave and I think there's a bunch of different styles of being a person. And I think the problem is, and this is a problem

Speaker 8:          02:40:14       that I had as a young man, I had an ultra competitive issue. I was competitive with my friends, I was competitive with other men. I was competitive. I would shit on people that I didn't know. Look at this fucking loser, you know, like it's a natural thing that young men go through. And it took me until I was probably in my early twenties till I realized how toxic that was. And I moved myself out of it and instead started celebrating people around me. I changed my vibe because I, I was very flawed as a young men, but also super hyper self critical. So my hyper self critical, I always wanted to be a better version of myself, but, and I would, I wouldn't do it the right way. Like it was Jack Cornfield's idea. Who's, who is it? Cornfield Jack Cornfield's idea. I didn't do it the right way.

Speaker 8:          02:41:01       I didn't do it his way. I did it the way that a barely educated 21 year old man who's mostly just read books on a combat sports and fighting philosophy in psychology. I have a very limited amount of information in my head, but I realized that there was some flaws in the way I was thinking and I realized I was spending all this energy getting mad at people that I didn't know, hating people that had things that I didn't have and I really, I was sitting around thinking about this once and it was as I was becoming more successful as a martial artist, I was realizing that one of the things that was holding me back before was my mind. And it wasn't just my physical talent, my skills, which also got better, but it was also that I had a better way of approaching competition that I had when I was younger because it didn't carry as much anxiety.

Speaker 8:          02:41:46       I was, I was still anxious, but less anxiety because I was more at peace with being around all these different people and stuff. Fuck this guy who's this fucking guy. I changed my strategy and it changed who I am and then as I got into comedy, I was alleviated by the actual real threat of competition, which greatly relaxed to me. It was a giant weight lifted off my back, but that carried a little bit of that. In the early days of stand up, I would look at other comedians like, fuck this guy. I get jealous of guys that were doing successful I that we're doing well rather that we're successful. I got jealous of guys who were funnier than me, like, why is he fucking funnier than me? It was, it was a stupid thought process and it took me till I was like, you know, like 2123 I started realizing like I got to snap out of this.

Speaker 8:          02:42:28       This is unhealthy. Like I'm wasting this energy where it should be concentrating on positive things. So I just started supporting my friends. I started being like a more complimentary person. I started, I just went out of my way to just be nicer to people, be nicer to people, not because they could do something for me, just to be nice, like it feels good to be nice and I just slowly cultivated a better philosophy and it took me a while, man. It took me until I was in my twenties till I really like, as I was like getting closer to 30 is when I started really getting good at it with comedy, you know, like bringing comedians on the road. Helping people. Yeah. That's fostering other career. Telling kids that were like seven years before, you know, behind me like they were, they started out seven years after me.

Speaker 5:          02:43:12       I'm at a seven years ahead of you. You can do this. Anybody can do this, right? Just do it. Just do it. And if you fuck up, learn from that fuck up. Get better. This is, this is the thing that you can do. You're a funny person, right? You're just, all you have to do is just keep doing this and you're gonna. You already made it. Yeah. No, this is the, so this thing that you're talking about, the thing that I, that the Rom Dass people teach me, which is invaluable and it to me and it really inspires you, is that they talk about Ron does his guru, neem Karoli Baba and how when he was teaching, he never said, here's what this is going to do for you. Right? He was never like, this is why this is how it's going to help you. He was always saying, here's how this is going to help the people in your life.

Speaker 5:          02:43:52       And so the moment you make that little shift where working on yourself as it's called, is not about doing something so that you can fucking have a fucking six pack and played. But the moment you start doing our fun in a cow and ride a horse, shaving, shaving your stomach, but, but the moment you start fucking doing this stuff because you know that it's going to directly help the people around you in ways you can't even imagine. Like you don't even know yet because there's going to be a moment in every single person's life where someone comes up to you who is in a lot of trouble and they need help and it might not be money, it might not. It might just be something you could say to them. It might just be something you need to be lucid in that moment and because you've been like, you know, not paying attention and you're blurry and you're angry and you're fucking shut down that you're not even going to see that person.

Speaker 5:          02:44:49       Right. That person is going to just be another face in the crowd that you don't even see. But that's the whole point is like this practice your practice. It ends up helping so many fucking people and if you want to get excited about something, at least for me, what makes, it's really kind of difficult for me to get super excited over like I don't know, some kind of like thing that's like, and it give me an extra thing. It's way less exciting than to think that like, Shit, man, if I can be more calm and more connected, then the next time around somebody I love and get angry, I'm not going to hurt them because I'm learning how to not react to my own bullshit. Right. You know, you're getting better at live. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:45:36       And it's through trial and error. I mean, that is a trial error, honesty. And you also have to realize that we're not all coming from the same starting block. You know? Right. Some people came from uh, abusive childhoods. Some people came from super supportive and loving childhood. Some people were spoiled as children and that's what they're, they're the people that struggle the most. Sometimes you see in kids that grow up in like really rich families where the pee pee parents weren't hands on. They're so disconnected. Right. You feel really weird and titled and they have a very distorted version of the future. And those people, it's very hard. It's very hard to adjust from a place of bounty, right. To a place of struggle and success and in in, you know, self realization almost more difficult for some of those people. Compassion look neat growing up as a person who didn't have money, you know, and, and thinking as when I was a child, when my family was on welfare, thinking I still can remember at least I have a, an idea of a memory of us drinking powdered milk.

Speaker 2:          02:46:32       I remember that. I remember being really embarrassed if people would come over our house. We had powdered milk, we are poor, you know, and that memory of being a young man, of being a struggling young comedian, doing a bunch of odd jobs, trying to make it like this, this real hunger and worry. I remember one of the most embarrassing moments of my young life, um, I had this thing fall out. It was like some management company was interested in me and they were like a music management company and they were thinking about branching off into comedians and guy was talking to me about it and it was falling apart and I was driving with my girlfriend and I was 21 and the whole thing was so frustrating to me that I just started crying, tears rolling. And I remember she looked over and she's like, are you crying?

Speaker 2:          02:47:17       I was like, yeah, fuck yeah. And she's like, oh. Like she was like mocking the fact that I was crying. She couldn't help herself, you know, she was same age, we're both at 21 we were both kids, you know, and she just thought it was a bitch move. Just be crying about being frustrated about your career. And I remember being so embarrassed, like, why did I, why did I let that out to her? Like, why did I let that out in public at this frustration of not knowing where the future lies, but that frustration and that hunger of like wanting to figure out a way to get out of this cycle of work in shitty jobs and figure out how to do something that I actually love doing. Like be a comic that, that burning hunger cause you don't have shit. That's where it all comes from.

Speaker 2:          02:48:00       Would you don't know where the fuck you're going to pay your rent. You do. You do not have an escape route. There's no net. You got to figure this fucking thing out man and you're not figuring it out right now. Right now it's fallen apart and nobody, nobody thinks you're any good. You can't get booked like fuck. You're trying to figure out what's the next job. You're going to get it so you could feed yourself. We tried to figure out this weird thing that nobody could really tell you how to do, you know, but then going through that struggle, that is everything, but people need to hear that you went through it too. They need to hear that, that during the dark days where it doesn't seem like it's ever going to work out, are you alive? Can you see? Can you talk? Can you think get better, get better, get better, whatever you're doing, skip better so you suck at it.

Speaker 2:          02:48:39       Now everybody sucks at everything when they first start. That's the whole thing about getting good at something, but if you love it and you're really honest, don't lie to yourself. Don't lie to yourself. Look at it for what it is. Look at it for what it is and work on it. Whatever the fuck it is, whether it's writing books or make you sick or composing a computer code, whatever the fuck you want to do. If you suck at it, get better. But look at it for what it is. Look at it for really what it is and that's one of our biggest problems. One of our biggest problems is that people have a really hard time looking at things for what they are if they're not flattering. That's right. Yeah. Do you want to think, oh fuck this guy. Fuck this guy goes a pussy now that guy, it shot a fucking rocket into space with a car on it.

Speaker 2:          02:49:22       Okay. And he did it with his mind. He figured out how to make these calculations. You figured out how to make enough money so he could shoot a car in a space. If you don't respect that, it's digging tunnels under La. They'll let them dig tunnels. There's an earthquake ridden area and this motherfucker is digging holes in the ground. We're worried about fracking, but we're like Eli musk got it. He said it's not going to cause an earthquake. It's not going to cause an earthquake. Yeah, we're worried about people fracking. We're not worried about Elon musk turning our fucking city into Swiss cheese.

Speaker 5:          02:49:50       Yeah, but you know, man, the thing is is that the guy you're make, you're like creating an image of the guy was like Fuck Elan. Good. That guy is real real. That's real. That's me. I was 21 right. Can you felt like you can quit and you felt like shit. That's the important thing is like that. That's all coming from feeling like shit. And when you get around somebody who's acting like that, if you've looked into yourself enough to see where you feel like shit and then you get around somebody and you realize like, oh this person is like being a complete fucking cunt to me right now feels like shit. And this is the, I went to see the Dalai Lama and Anaheim and who you're partnering with Ron Doss. The Dalai Lama. Wow. This is like not parting with it. I would love to party with a fucking Dalai Lama.

Speaker 5:          02:50:41       I would love that. I'm really might nullify my cock if I got a chance to party with the Dalai Lama space forever. It's another thing to talk to. I'd do. I'd love to be around that guy man. Just cause like when he was like so far down in this massive place, this little guy, you could feel his, the energy rushing off of this guy into the room. It will be trippin maybe. But anyway. But anyway, the thing that he said that stuck with me as he's like, one of the things he says is so simple and it reminds me what you're saying now is he said you can always be kinder. And then the other thing he said, and it sounds so simple, but really people don't realize that you can always be kinder at any moment. And then the other thing he said is if someone's being unkind to you, it's not them being unkind to you.

Speaker 5:          02:51:29       It's an echo, is what he said. Like it's literally an echo of the unkindness people being cruel to them throughout their lives and that shit is bouncing off of them like sound. It's bouncing onto you. And so when you get around someone who's like being a shit, what you're really experiencing is that there you're a lot of sorrow from a lot of places you don't know. And that doesn't mean you're supposed to lay back and let them like spit on you or be a shithead to you or whatever. But it also, it helps you find a little bit of compassion, right? That's just just so you can be with that person and let them be what they are without adding more suffering to it. Right? Which only compounds

Speaker 8:          02:52:15       this situation. Well, you have to learn how people are responding to that behavior too and, and adjust accordingly. Get and do the hard work and look at yourself. And when people get super self indulgent, one of the things that they do is they don't think about how other people are experiencing them. Right? Like if you're around people like fucking the fucking worse look always fucking happens to me. It's safety every day at work. Fucking boss knows it wasn't. Mike did put in the work. I put fucking 65 70% of the work. Yes. Yes. Whoa. Does she leave?

Speaker 8:          02:52:51       Yeah, those people are gross. You're like, I gotta go, man. I can't. When people started go, which don't do, what is the worst thing people do to you? When we were, what should I do? What did the should do? Metal neutral advice and needs. Invites. Hey, hey, hey. No, you don't. You dust sound. What's going on? You want me to talk about you? You're making me focus on you 100% you're not asking me for help for yourself. You're not helping yourself at all. What you're doing is making me concentrate on you are, bro. Fuck, I'm really feeling depressed right now. Well, do something about it. I'm not saying don't reach out to your friends, but I'm saying you got to do something to man. You can't just always talk about your problems. Talk about my problems. You didn't want to hear him because that's all you talk about.

Speaker 8:          02:53:34       What's your whole life? A problem, right? Jesus Christ. Maybe that's the way you're thinking. Maybe this is the way you're behaving. We mapped out your life or am I saying that you shouldn't be there for your friends when issues arise and there's a, certainly all of our friends are super supportive. We've all gone through some weird shit in our lives. We've all been super supportive, but if I'm super supportive to you, I know you're super supportive to yourself. Yeah, I know you're working on yourself too, right? Not just relying on me. They broke. What should I do today, which I do tomorrow? What are you thinking? If you could sit down here with me for a few hours and map out my future roadway pressured cause it's just fucking hard out there for me bro. You gotta do shit. Don't fucking bullshit dude. You're fucking, you know man. Fuck you had a good headstart. You're white guard from North Carolina. Fuck you dude. It's what it is man. Come up these toxic excuses for why their life is shit without ever looking inward. And they'd want you to admit your privilege and admit your fucking advantages bro. Hello you Duncan [inaudible] it was easier for you. The truth for me. But,

Speaker 5:          02:54:39       but the question is like, cause I know exactly what you're talking about and I know that person and I know when I run into that with that is there's a part of me that, and I like what I know sometimes you just have to put someone you have to like avoid their presence. So you gonna say put them on blast. I thought you were going, can I put them on blast? No, cause it doesn't work. That doesn't work. But maybe it does for you. I don't know, but it does put, there's a, they just get mad at you, right? So, but there is a thing of like I, and this is where I might just be fucking naive or crazy or one toke over the line, sweet. But I believe that with any body that you're around, if you've cultivated love, like if you can really love them, even in the midst of that cyclone of bullshit that you're talking about, if you could look through the cyclone right into their soul, like into what they are that's love and see that and love it, then the psych clonal start calming down a little bit right in front of you.

Speaker 5:          02:55:39       I think it's possible. I think it's possible that if, and this is why I think it's fucking worth figuring out a way to cultivate this shit that you're talking about so that when you get around a Turd cycline like that, you know that you, you actually, you become potentially the person who like not by giving them money or giving them advice, but just by giving them love and letting them be this cyclone of shit for a second and loving it for real. You might be the thing that, that just like musk's fucking tesla hits the media or in sends it into earth, you might be the thing that dings the media or of their life and prevents the catastrophe that they were spinning towards.

Speaker 8:          02:56:20       It's entirely possible, but it's also entirely possible that like most things in life, you need a lot of various elements. You don't just need one person, right, that you cling to. You mean to look at humanity as a whole. You need to seek inspiration in the great work of others and you need to look at yourself in a way that you think maybe perhaps other people look at you. Right. And that is something that a lot of people don't do. And that lack of introspection and self critical thinking is one of the reasons why people don't change. Right. Cause they don't adjust. Right. Like you're not the guy you were 10 years ago. I've known you for a long time. You're a better version because you've adjusted. Yeah. I mean not that you were bad then. I love you back then you were awesome. But you're, you're a more together, more philosophical, more at ease with yourself person than you were 10 15 years ago. Yeah. Like when we were living together and I, we lived together when you were at a down spot. You're a totally different human now. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:57:13       Cool. Yeah. And you are begin. And that's the thing, man. Because you are like in those moments when you were like, when we're riding in my fucking mini cooper and I'm trying to listen to Elliot Smith and you know, I'm depressed

Speaker 8:          02:57:24       and you're like, dude, what are you listening to? What the fuck you listening to you? I'll never forget that. And I'll tell you, man, in my head, I'm like, what a Dick was definitely being the day. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:57:36       But, but, but that what, what that was was like though, it was what you were doing is helping me, like get out of that vibration that I was, you were wallowing in it. Yes. And I needed in it. And I didn't in those moments when you were doing that shit, I was like in my head resisting. And I'm like, you know, but that's the other thing, when you decide to help somebody and that way you can't expect it's going to, there's shift or change. It's going to happen instantaneously. But because of that, I still to this day when I put on Elliot Smith, I think at that moment, man, I still, they hear your voice in my head going to go, he it, what are you doing? Because you know what I mean? Because, because, and I'll tell you why man. Because sometimes when you can listen to Elliot Smith and not be wallowing and it's just really pretty and sweet, but don't listen to that shit if you're wallowing because it's like, it's, yeah.

Speaker 8:          02:58:31       Oh, won't feed the wallet. Don't feed the wall. Yeah. Don't feed that wallowing spirit inside of you. Don't. You don't need to feel that everybody experiences loss and everybody experiences bad moments. You just going to you, you never going to get life perfect. Right? So during these bad moments, what you got to realize is just accepted. Feel it, get through it. Realize it's a journey that you're going to get through. But yeah, realize that there's better ways to navigate it. Then some and some ways are really bad. The is a really bad way to navigate it and started doing heroin and start fucking listen to Elliot Smith ago holding a knife over your stomach in the middle of your fucking bedroom going, fuck it man. Fuck it, man. I can't do that. You can't do that. Well, you can look him, but it's not, it's not the healthiest way to go. That's going to give people around you and you yourself the most joy. It's not necessarily selfish, it's self indulgent for sure. I don't necessarily think it's selfish. I think it's just, it's, it's a pattern of behavior that you can get trapped in. Yeah. And I think we've all been in bad situations where you just feel like shit like you, you get in a pattern of behavior and you feel trapped, but you gotta, you gotta learn from other people who've been through those patterns and learn from your own experiences getting through pat.

Speaker 5:          02:59:43       Yeah. Cause you get you, well that's the thing man. It's like when you get around someone, he's like a teacher figure. Like you early, you get around somebody know that he was like really doing it from love and not trying to fucking like fuck with you because that's, that can happen the worst or be superior to you or, right, right, right. Pull you down and yeah. Yeah. You down when you get around somebody who's like doing it out of, out of love. There is such a massive difference in, in the, in the way that feels and, and what they do quite often or what a lot of my teachers do, which is really fucking cool because like in the same way you've seen me kind of go shift, you know, a lot of my teachers from the Rom dies camp like in the beginning when I was actively trying to offend them because that was what I would try to do. It's like it'd be funny not be funny cause I was thinking if I can offend these people about the practice, they're teaching me and they're like, hey, you can't say that or that's blasphemy or anything like that. Then I know to get the fuck out of there cause it's like, you know what I mean? Because you were, you were calculated. Fuck yeah. Is calculated with one. It was one of my teachers. Ragu,

Speaker 8:          03:00:49       his name's Ragu. Like the spaghetti sauce. It means a different thing in the, it does change your name Bro. It's a, my name's spaghettios but listen bro, don't think about it like that. And my master spaghettios taught me, what the fuck did you just,

Speaker 5:          03:01:04       he's amazing. He's amazing. And like in the same sauce the same way you're doing that with the garlic, the same way you're doing that with him. I would try to do that with like their teachers and, and, and, but, and I would try to do that too because I was like, fuck it. If they get mad at me right then I know then who cares if there's a thing where I don't like blasphemy, I don't like the idea. I can blast fee, man, that freaks me the fuck out. But it was like when named Karoli Baba, you know, they tell me these stories and I'd be like, you know, I just don't, I just don't really believe that man. Like I don't know if that it's, I don't know if I believed that shit. And rog you, I still remember saying that walking in this at the retreat with him in Hawaii and he gets a big smile on his face.

Speaker 5:          03:01:42       He's like, yeah, yeah, I don't blame you for not believing in it. It's like, Whoa, cool man, this is fucking cool. And it's that. That's the, so when you get around a real teacher, what I'm saying is the place that you're at, they let you be there, but they're not like in the sense that they're letting you do the pattern that you're in. But by allowing that to happen in its own way and then adding to it the intention of like, I think I'm going to help you grow here. That's when you really start changing. Not when someone's like you, when you were in the car and listen to Elliot Smith and you were fucking recognizing in me a lot of sadness and a lot of fucked up Nez. You weren't scolding me, dude, you are giving me love. But the way you were giving me what I love was by making fun of me in this really sweet way. And it worked. You know what I mean? It was, it was. So that's the thing. That's what a real teacher does. And that's why it's like, you know, it took to learn how to get to that spot is one of the most important things you could do.

Speaker 8:          03:02:46       Also from a selfish standpoint, um, when you have a good friend that is all sudden looking for a place to live and then they could live with you, it's cool, it's far right. But it also feels really good to help some money to help somebody that you love and you really care about. So I mean, I don't even think I thought about it for three seconds. When you called me up and you were in a hotel room, I go, dude, come live with me. Yeah, it was like instantly Dunkin's live with me instantly. I was like, she got a place to live, dude. You never have to worry about having a place to live. I wanted you to, you know, and also you were, I've had a lot of people that have offered the tank to anytime you want, come on by, you can use tank.

Speaker 8:          03:03:27       You were the only guy who use it on a regular basis. Like when it tate live with me. He didn't touch that fucking crazy thing. He's like, fuck this. He might've gotten in there once, I don't know, but that was not his style at the time, you know? But you were in there all the time and you were writing journals and shit. When you get out of, then we would talk about it. You would talk about your inner voyage when you'd go in that tank and just think about your life and how you, you're, you know, well what you're doing and what happened and what went wrong and where were you to and

Speaker 2:          03:03:58       just look, Damn. The fucking stress of trying to be a professional comic is it fucks. You know how I know it fucks you? Because it fucks me every two years, every two years when I abandoned my act and put out a special and I'd have to write a whole new one and a goddamn sweating. Just thinking about it right now, like Thompson girls gone through that right now, our, he's going through that right now. That's, that's the shedding of, of all you've got. And then you've got to start from scratch to fucking terrifying again. And that's the thing that makes you keep growing. The thing that makes you keep growing. But when you're, when you haven't had any success, like when you were in the beginning of your career and it just hadn't happened yet, you're like, you don't really believe it can happen. But once you do have it happen, then you go, oh, I see. Just gotta get through that

Speaker 5:          03:04:46       dude. The thing you're talking about with the comedy, it's, it applies to everything. And it's like the, it's because what you're talking about, someone's always telling me, like if a snake doesn't successfully shed its skin, it dies. And, and, and that, so a person is the same way in the sense that many of us clean to ways that we were thinking, that's who we still are when we're not. Yeah. And, and, and you have to learn what parts of yourself you to let go of, like, and you have to have the guts to fucking let go of it. And Dude, that is one of the craziest things. When you really have a thing that you've become attached to, for a lot of people, it's a relationship that sucks. You end up in a bad relationship, bad job. You end up just come attached to some version of yourself that you just aren't anymore.

Speaker 5:          03:05:45       That's not who you are, right? You got to let go of that. You got to let go of it. And, and, and letting go of it is death. It's a form of death. It feels like death. And so people want to avoid it. And what ends up happening is you run into people who are just fucking don't even realize, did their valets covered in bags from all these preview. They're hoarders and they won't let go of all these things, all these ways they used to be. So that's the, the, the, the, what I, I've learned is that through this act of like scanning the south are looking into this south, you'll find places where you're stuck, where you're stuck. Like for example, you were saying, okay, I get jealous. I was getting jealous of these people. I was getting jealous. Well, you were stuck there.

Speaker 5:          03:06:34       That was the plan. It wasn't just Joe's worse than that. It was a toxic or it was, I didn't like them. Yes. Mad at them. Yeah, you were stuck. Yeah. And you are attached and you were like in that attachment was making you unhappy, miserable, heavy, heavy. The feeling is literally not just that week. We, we felt weak. Well those were really bothered because all the energy that's being put in, they carry no, in my judgment of myself. Yeah. Yeah. Not, not weak, like tired, like didn't have the energy week. Like, Oh, you bitch, you bitch, you're just jealous. That's you. That's you now. Yeah. I know man. And the, these are like, you know, like when I'm fuck dude, when you get a really bad muscle spasm and then you go to a misuse and that, that moment when the thing finally gives way and you're like, oh, that place in your back that hurts so bad suddenly just feels like you're back again.

Speaker 5:          03:07:28       And you're like, ah. Well the, the, uh, the same thing happens with suffering. So the suffering and a lot of people's lives, they're repeating suffering. That's a karmic muscle spasm. And, and it's like, until you literally push into it and the same way you get rid of a muscle spasm, it fucking hurts man. Until you like get the blood flow going back into that place and really fucking go deep into why do I get jealous? You know, for me, the thing I just figured out or that's haunted me, it's just jealousy in relationships. It's like, why do I do this? What is this? This is just like you're saying it's weak. It's not a good look. I don't like it. And it's indulgent. Like while you're doing it, you realize it's gross. Yes. And You keep doing it. Yes. And you're like, oh my God, I'm being a bitch and I'm gonna keep going.

Speaker 5:          03:08:19       You fucking texted him first. Yes. That Joe, that it's so humiliating and so embarrassing and so fucked up and so brutal to the person you're with. So like that thing I figured, I figured out a lat, am I say let it go? Oh, it's the illusion. I don't, not putting out there that you can conquer, you know, eternally parts of your identity or whatever. But I've been able to let that go and that feeling of really being able to let it go, wow, man, that's, to me, that's one of those monumental things when you can start dropping these things and it's different for everybody. Everybody's got their own fucking muscle spasm, but you'll know what it is. You know what, any people listening to it right now, you know what it fucking is. We are incredibly, uh, so we, we are incredibly susceptible to patterns incredibly.

Speaker 5:          03:09:12       So. Yeah. And if you have a pattern of weakness and you accept it over and over again, it can define you and you have to be really careful that he got it. Well, yeah. And but in, what's the beauty of it though, is the very fucking thing that's hurting you like that. It's also simultaneously the thing that's like your, it's your fuel for improvement. Yeah. It's like you're turning your trap. This is such a cheesy thing that I thought I said that I'm, that I'm never going to like make it a blog post or anything, so I forget me if I did think about this. It's turning your trap into a trampoline. It's like you find this fucking, you have a self help speaker. I need, see right now in a theater, I know that's like a big screen behind you. It's trying your tread happen.

Speaker 5:          03:09:57       I knew that's why he has it. I deserved to be made fun of for it and I'm not going to ever use that in a book or in a blog post or anything, but I really do like the concept of like finding the place you're stuck and realizing that that's not a place you should avert your eyes from, but in fact more than likely that's a door, right? That's a fucking door. And you can go through that door into a whole new existence where you're no longer horrified by yourself and that that is really exciting. It's really fucking wonderful moment. You know, not just in comedy, but I think in anything

Speaker 8:          03:10:30       it's always a powerful thing to improve. It's a, that's one of the things that's good about doing things that you're not good at. Um, is it, you get the opportunity to see what happens when you work at something and then you improve. And I think that applies to everything. I think if you learn how to play a game, you get really good at a game. I think that figuring things out in your mind how to get good at this game applies to life. I think there's a, you could get caught up in a game where like chess or whatever it is becomes your whole life and then it's almost too much. Right? But you can also use things like chess or a lot of different things. Like we have, people have a heavy prejudice against video games, but this, it's been absolutely proven that video games can enhance many aspects of the way people think and problem solve.

Speaker 8:          03:11:12       It's been proven. I mean there's studies don't doing that. People are doing on it, but we associate video games with wasting time slacking off being a loser. Mimo. Jamie, what the fuck were you just telling me the other day about how much money these guys make when they're playing twitch? Yeah. Thousands of dollars a day, if not hundreds of thousands a month. Hundreds of thousands dollars a month playing fucking video games. How has being a lawyer better than that? You fucking asshole. Is it about making money? What is it about, cause these twitch guys got you beat fuck face. Yeah. You're out there just making people get divorced and raking in the cash. This guy is shooting aliens on twitch and it's making it way more. Yeah, you're a loser. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          03:11:55       Private Gucci shoes. He's got a diamond crusted grow legs and he plays video games. Do you understand how crazy that is? You're over there working on family law. Do you watch twitch? No. See that's the thing, man. You know, uh, things to do, but I don't mind God Z. I play, I play a lot of games, man. I only have so much time. I played, I play pool. I shoot archery, dude, you got to, first of all, you got to watch twitch just for just for the sake of definitely don't. Just so you know, for the podcast, you don't have to, but you need to look to that. You could see the how one, how it sounds when you hear about it. I remember when I first heard about it, I'm like that there's an unseen mighty mouse. Do it. It's really entertaining. Yeah. And it's really funny and it's like when you're looking at like the, the community that forms around these people and like, then you realize like, man, there really is something really soothing and addictive about watching.

Speaker 5:          03:12:51       Dude. Have you seen that twitch guy who trolls people and uh, what's it called? My space that, what's that world where, what? No, no, it's chuck not vr chat. There's this dude goes into different video games playing a character and trolls people inside the games and it's some of the funniest fucking shit you've ever seen. Like he goes into what second life? He goes into second life somehow makes it into a, like a enclave of people playing the part of bikers in there. And he goes in there and they're like, they're acting like bikers. So they're like, how'd you get in here? And he's like, I don't know, I'm just, you know, I'm here. He's like, dad has this very calm voice that like, you need to get out of here. And he's like, I just, I, you know, I, I'll come, I'm going to go, but I'll be back tomorrow.

Speaker 5:          03:13:38       And they're like, no, you will not be back here tomorrow. You are not coming back. This is our place. Or you had to show that. Can you show that on? I was looking up second life isn't allowed on twitch for some reason, but this, it's a streamer. Look up second life are, this is our place. I don't know if you can, if you'll even be able to find it. So our play suit, it is the funniest shit. So there's a video that he recorded. Then you put it online so people would watch it and he trolls. Shit. Tons of people this way man. If you find it, I found a video says extreme angry, extreme angry ranger for a hell. Hilarious. Trolling that. Probably a second life. Three fingers. What can I see it? I'll know what it is right away. That's a theme. I think it's probably him.

Speaker 5:          03:14:21       But go back and look up. This is our place biker. Second life troll and maybe someone on twitter can help us find it cause it's like a pretty famous troll video. But it's like the funniest fucking shit man. Like I've watched it a million times. I'm looking on twitter right now to see was there ever trolling before the Internet? This is it dude. I think. I think that's it man. Second life will shut her down and I will speak to me. It's one of them. What's the one? So she's talking you have a different one. What's the one in that yet as a second life.

Speaker 5:          03:15:04       Hold on. What's that one? You going to come to a fucking MC motorcycle club. He's using. Yeah. Abbreviation. I have a reputation that precedes me. You can go anywhere and you can mention my name. Why am I am famous? You know what? Because Heights, people that be like, that's not him. That's amazing though. What's the one in the lower and the first suggestion right there. I was hooked already now that, anyway, the point is watching video games is a, is a fucking blast. I wish I could finesse. It's weird. Look, watching games is a blast. I like watching. That's that guy. The doctor disrespect. Yeah. Um, there's like, there's a lot

Speaker 3:          03:15:50       of things that's interesting. I like watching people play pool. I do, right. I don't even play golf. And I like watching people play golf because they talking or should I do, what should I do? Like things going to make it. Yeah. I think he's going to fuck up looking at me. Sweating. Yes. It's fun. Yeah, it's fine. The thing about video games is you can do it from the first person so you can look at it from their perspective.

Speaker 5:          03:16:08       Yeah. And it's fucking crazy to watch me. I went to, I went to the um, Blizzcon, you know, blizzard has the Blizz con like, like I, I was lucky enough to get in there, man. And I got to watch like a East sports. I got to watch people playing star craft and an auditorium and it was awesome and the energy and there was so fucking intense. People were there, I don't know, hundreds, hundreds. It was like shit, tons man. These are like famous players do it. These are like world renowned Korean fucking star craft masters in like when they're there and if you know anything about starcraft and you see what they're doing, it's incredible. And it's just like, you know the applause, the fucking like people are like,

Speaker 3:          03:16:54       well it's super complex. So fun to watch. That's what I'm talking about. What this people that have these prejudices about video games, there's super like video games, especially like starcraft. They are super complex. They require a multilevel thinking. Oh yeah. Oh yeah, you can't fuck, you can't just play star craft. Not against those guys. I mean I've seen you play it for two and I'm like, what are you doing? And moving shit around like what are you doing? Like Oh, I'm setting this up and this is for later. Like what? I know, like what is this

Speaker 5:          03:17:21       tried to return to it. Talk about like feeling old. Go back to try to play starcraft after a couple of expansions of come out and you're just like, I can't, what the fuck man, I have to learn. You don't have that kind of time. I don't have that kind of time to like learn how to do fucking [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          03:17:38       is again, I don't want to be, I liked, oh my God, this is that like the o two arena. It looks at opening ceremonies and soul for 2014 legal legends. Oh Wow. God, it's a football stadium. Yeah. It's like a giant soccer stadium so bad. Oh my God. It's filled with people. That's like 50,000 people there. Yeah. That's cool man. That's insane. It's so big in Korea. Huh? Holy Shit Dude. All those people look at the size of the police too. Why isn't that caught on like that here? There's what overwatch league, they just started this week or this month. That's in the, in Burbank. I liked the old Johnny Carson theater. Oh sure. Yeah. That's cool dude. When I was, uh, addicted to quake, I would watch demos all the time from this guy named thresh. See if you could fine thresh quake. There was this kid, God, I wish I remembered his name.

Speaker 3:          03:18:31       I think his last name was falling tennis fong. There it is. Dennis Fong, he was the best. And while he was playing before he retired, he was the best. Like he was so good that people would watch his demos and try to emulate his moves. And what he would do was he would figure out a map like absolutely. So He'd have these one on one duels and this is another thing that's surprisingly complex is playing duals in. This is quake one that we're looking at here. Oh No it's not. It looks like quick three. Hold on. Quick one tournament. This, it goes at a new version of it. Oh No, it's definitely quick one. Okay. So there, cause you see the shotgun shells and shit like that. There's all different stuff. There's rocket launchers and this didn't have a rail gun. The rail gun changed a lot of shit and quake two.

Speaker 3:          03:19:12       But the point being that you would have these strategies because you had a map and it would all be about controlling the response. So all of the items, well it's a rocket launcher or shotgun or whatever the fuck it is that you're picking up. And the, the Ammo, all of it would respond as well as the health. So it was all about controlling where the respawn is, keeping your health up really high and then making sure your opponent never gets any good weapons. And so they would, it was really strategic and they chase each other around the map. This one dude just fucked everybody up. I mean, and he lost a couple of times too when he was, you know, starting out. But he eventually got to a point where he was like the Michael, like the right there, boom. He's, he's that guy. Boom Jackson.

Speaker 3:          03:19:53       He knows where you're going. He's firing rockets down hallways. He anticipates you're going to be going down and when you would watch these guys play it. See like right there, that guy was there and he's just waiting for him. Boom, boom. And he just killed the dude. And I would watch these guys in these demos and try to learn from like how they were maneuvering. There's another guy called fatality and he was really good at it and there was different games that guys would play too. There was this game and some guys went over to unreal and they played unreal tournament. It's got the armor st every time it responds, he's going to be running back there to get that armor running back there to get the shotgun shells, making sure that his opponent doesn't have a rocket and you just keep killing them. And then when he responds he chased him down, kill him again or weaken them.

Speaker 3:          03:20:36       And then these are fucking really complex multilevel games. You have to think in advance and you have to plan things out and guys would even have timed things that they would put in a program so that it would show on their screen. Rocket launcher responding and 10 seconds, nine Aa. Yeah. Yeah. It's crazy how when this came out, it was so bad ass. And now it looks so ancient. It looks weird. But, but go to quick. What does the quake for one, what does the new quake one quick tournament, what does it? Quake champions and the, it's called quake champions. There's one you could play online now. I think it's called quake champions.

Speaker 3:          03:21:18       Oh. Came out last year. Now Watch this shit arena. That's what it is. Quake champions arena. Is that it? But look at the fucking graphics now. But it's the same kind of concept, right? So you know this, this guy is playing a one on one against someone and there's these crazy maps. Looks bad ass at was the last time you played quake forever. Dude, I'm terrified. No daddy got problems. Like you're like, watch. I'm feel crazy dude. I'm telling you I can't do this. I used to play this shit for eight, 10 hours a day. I told you I got a t one line stolen my fucking house at is so fucking funny though. Just nailed him with a real gun. Yeah, I was. I had a real problem. So, uh, I prefer, uh, archery and a bunch of other things that I get addicted to, but I could easily get addicted to this again.

Speaker 3:          03:22:11       Yeah. Is so fun. Look super shooters. What? Oh, you, but you don't, you just don't play them. Right. Listen, if we decided to do that, would you come and play it here? Yeah, of course. Okay. What we're thinking about doing is we have a conference room that I'm thinking about turning to a land party room. Oh, cool. And have it set up. We'll set up a quick games and then we'll, uh, maybe we'd host a server and let a certain amount of people online. Yeah. And then we could have what you call deathmatch outcome with death matches. Like you have 10 people on a map and they're all just going crazy and you respond with all your shit. Just do that. But what about, why don't we pick up a new one like this, this fucking game in this game. [inaudible] battlegrounds. Battlegrounds. Yeah. Man, this is probably bad at, I don't want real physics.

Speaker 3:          03:22:55       I don't want to move around like are moving around in real life. That's the thing about quake cause you move weight quicker than you do in real life. It's like you're bouncing and jumping. You're hitting trampolines and flying through the air. Oh Man, this thing looks pretty cool. If you'll look, we think you'd like it cause you hunt people. You're hiring someone else and I'm not even a hundred people bro. I mean the hunting aliens that can move faster. The people with rocket launches you didn't buy. Those are quaker. What about hearthstone? Joe, why don't you start playing hearthstone? You want me to cast spells like you do have to be naked again. I like overwatch then cause that's a little bit more, yeah, overwatch is. That's a third person thing. This is the one I was explaining the overwatch league. This is the viewing of it.

Speaker 3:          03:23:36       So I specialize. You can view it, but I like watching things through someone's eyes. That's it. There you go. First person who the Rogers. Hey this looks great. This looks great. Yeah. This is team based. We should have an overwatch league. I suck at it. You know he's good at it as Pemberton you can get pampered. Sure. Just look at them. So is this um, something that you played with a pc or is this an okay, I know this one's on all of them. This one, I can't play xbox games. Once you play with a mouse and a keyboard that controllers just so wide. They're supposed to be making an update soon. So you can do that. Actually a mouse and keyboard on the next box. Oh well that's what they should be taking. So long to do that. Lizard has said there is so bad ass ears ago.

Speaker 3:          03:24:16       There's still a thing like an x box has said recently they would allow people to play, I guess people on playstation network, but Sony doesn't want to play friends with them at Sachs. Well see the thing about computers is when you have a mouse and a keyboard, you can just have so much more precision. Guys get really good. And they also have like auto aiming. It keeps you in the box when you're using those. They, the Vicks, they've made it a little bit better. So there's a little hand controllers are more accurate than they used be. But man, it ain't the same when you're, when you have a mouse and keyboard, like if you watch that guy google fatality in the eye and fatality was a number one. This guy would hit people with a rail gun in the middle of the air so often it was almost like he was psychic crazy and you'd watch him play and you watch through his eyes and you realize how bad you are at the game and that was part of the reason why I got so addictive made it to number one on that new game I was talking about.

Speaker 3:          03:25:09       He did his twitch channel says right here, it's not a stream. Listen play. That's him. He's a savage. I met that kid in Vegas. Very nice car. He's not a kid anymore. I'm sure he's in this deep in his thirties now I think because it's a long ass time ago that he was running quake unless he was six. There he is. He's a dad. He's got dad bod, got a fucking golf shirt on. It's dropped his kids off at their fucking out people online. I love it man. If this is like such a better future than I predicted when I was a kid, like I never imagined that we would be able to watch people play video games or that, that you could make a career out of playing not just a career, but make more in a month than lawyers make any, had some odd, these people were all painting and playing music and stuff.
