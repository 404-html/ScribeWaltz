Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello

Speaker 2:          00:02          Bitches, I want to talk for a little bit about the cryotherapy because this is something that I emailed you when there was a disturbing article that was sorta poopooing the benefits cryotherapy in the article was I thought it was really poorly. Well, poorly done, poorly researched and it was also, it was studied really subjective things like how sore you felt after exercise and whether or not benefited from that, but yeah, but there are real positive benefits of Cryo therapy that are measurable.

Speaker 1:          00:33          Yes. And that happened as well. First of all that article that you're referring to from that,

Speaker 2:          00:38          um, whatever website it was, but the article was Steve Novella is a guy and I think what he did is he rushed to put this article out because that woman died in Las Vegas from Cryo therapy and it was a really tragic incident. She was by herself. There's two different types of cryo therapy. One of the things we should point out, first of all, I don't have any guys I've been accused of this. I should just say right now, I don't have any vested interest in cryotherapy. I don't own any of it. I don't. I don't make any money from it. Nothing. I enjoy the benefits of it and I use it, but this woman who did it, she did the type. There's two kinds. One of them goes from the neck down, so you stand in this booth. Your head is above breathing and normal oxygen, but below you is liquid nitrogen.

Speaker 2:          01:19          You can't read that stuff in. That's why your head is not under. If you do breathe that stuff in, you don't have any oxygen. You'll black out and that's what happened to her. She did it by herself. It was poorly set up and apparently she was quite short so her head was kind of below the the the limit where you're supposed to be. So she was breathing in the liquid nitrogen and she fell asleep and blacked out. So you get one of those times I thought she was in like, no, no, no, no. The full on ones are much rarer and what the full on ones do is they super cool the air with the nitrogen. So the air itself is pumped in really cool. What I did, that's what you did and that's what we're gonna do today too, if you have the time.

Speaker 2:          02:01          I love that. Okay, let's do that one. You can breathe in. It's just fucking unbelievably cold. Okay. So the one that she did was she set up by herself, which you're never supposed to do. You're always supposed to have supervision. So it wasn't whether or not. I mean she's the only person I've ever heard of this died from this. And it's a horrible trash committing suicide. No, no. She was just worried there. And sometimes women will, um, they'll put their face under it because they want the effects of a cryo facial [inaudible]. Cryo facial has been shown to improve Collagen and

Speaker 1:          02:33          flattens your therapy actually prevents it. Stopped. It inhibits enzymes that break down collagen called college and is. And that's actually part of the reason it helps with arthritis. Arthro College Nase is break down Collagen and they break down like, you know, the tendons college and around the tendons and seven, it can cause arthritis, arthritic pain. So doing it would make sense why you'd want to do something cryo because it. It would have an effect. Right? I understand.

Speaker 2:          02:56          Yeah. Women love it when they get their face done. Apparently get or

Speaker 1:          03:00          vein men to or any man. Hello, you don't have to be vain to college. But the point being that article came out and all these people were saying, oh see, I told you cryotherapy was bullshit. I'm like, oh my God, what a Piss poor article. And it was all talking about soreness and one of the things that he said that really drove me crazy was you. You'd get just as much benefit from a cool down and stretch after a workout. I'm like, tell that to these fucking people that I see that go there all the time, that do it twice a day because they have severe arthritis and it's the only thing that's given them any form of, of, of freedom, of movement of their hands. I know a bunch of people that go there that have had some really debilitating arthritis and this has given them relief where nothing else was given it to them other than like pretty severe pharmaceutical drugs or Ibuprofen at high levels or what you were talking about, like there's a lady that goes to my thing, but she was raving about how she can finally stretch your hands out.

Speaker 1:          03:53          Like her hands had been locked in this position for years. Yeah, it has. I mean the, the cold itself is a hormetic stressor that is activating a variety of antiinflammatory pathways, antioxidant pathways. You know, and it's also last time I think on the podcast we talked about, it increases norepinephrine, norepinephrine itself. It can. So cryotherapy and cold water immersion are two forms of cold exposure. Cryotherapy just two minutes at like a minus 180 Fahrenheit can increase norepinephrine. Twofold. That's twofold over what you were before you went in and nor epinephrin. In addition to the brain benefits we were talking about how it makes you feel good, how it helps with learning. It also is a very potent anti inflammatory, so it inhibits the production of TNF Alpha, which is very. It's kind of like in arthritis, tnf Alpha is kind of like going haywire. You're making too much tnf Alpha, and what happens is tnf alpha is a signaling molecule to or your immune cells that says, hey, there's an infection here because that's normally what happens when you release Tnf Alpha is because there's some bacteria or some something that you need to kill.

Speaker 1:          05:02          And so your immune cells, all they see is the signal. They don't know what's causing it. They don't know that it's because your gut cells and your immune cells in your gut are seeing bacteria because of your poor diet or whatever. And so that's getting into the bloodstream and causing chronic inflammation. It doesn't know that it. All it knows is that this means there's a threat. And so they start to increase the production of your immune cells make hypochlorite, which is like bleach. So you're making bleach in your body to kill things. And that's happening chronically. That's gonna cause some tissue damage. It's going to cause pain. Um, it also, they also make hydrogen peroxide. You make that your immune cells will make that so cryotherapy inhibits the signaling molecule so that your immune cells quiet down because now they're not seeing that signal that says, come on, hey, fire up, fire up.

Speaker 1:          05:47          It's not there. So that's a good thing to inhibit tnf alpha. And like I said, with the college and a's as well. Um, but there are so many. I did, you know, I just spent two weeks just researching and reading. I've been doing some cold exposure, you know, like cold shower and also jumping in the ocean ice bath. And I really liked the cryotherapy, um, that I did last time we were here and uh, you know, so I've, I've been very interested in it, like understanding why you feel so good. And so I did some reading on it and there's so many different positive hormetic benefits from doing cryotherapy. So you have, you know, the, the, the anti-inflammatory part and this, and this also, it's been shown that doing like 10 sessions of cryotherapy in a row, it increases the expression of glutathione reductase by twofold.

Speaker 1:          06:37          And another glue of that fly on related enzyme glutathione peroxidase by like 68 percent. And these are these enzymes like you could be taking all the liposomal glutathione you want, like it's not going to matter if you don't have the enzyme's active to use it. So you can take lyposomal glutathione and that's great. You're increasing your, you make glutathione inside of yourselves. But, um, we, we can't make as much of it as we get older, but if you take it and you don't have the enzymes that use it to actually do the good stuff active that it doesn't matter. So cryotherapy was shown to activate to different glutathione related enzymes, which is pretty awesome. So it would enhance your body's ability to absorb glutosiome no, it doesn't enhance your body's ability to absorb it. It enhances your body's ability to use it right off the bat and then you're using cryotherapy.

Speaker 1:          07:26          It would enhance it. Um, so what I'm saying is that the lyposomal glutathione that you take, all that does is increase glutathione inside of yourselves. Gludethyon inside of your cells does nothing without enzymes that use it to, uh, to basically sequester damaging inflammatory things. And the cryo therapy increased, activates the enzymes that use it. So it's like, great, I have all this food with Iowa and sitting around on myself that I've been taking and I also now have the enzymes that use it to do good stuff now are being turned on that. What was very interesting is that it took like multiple sessions before, before those got like 10 to 2010 and one at least 10 and yeah. And then the other study was 20. So it was it consecutively at 10 days in a row. Yeah, 10 days in a row. But the first day I didn't do it.

Speaker 1:          08:18          So that, that was also very interesting. So it's almost like your body is saying, okay, this crazy fuck of them. And do data response. Yep. Yeah. Your body's preparing for war. It's like a, it's stressful. It's a stressful response. The other thing that's really cool that we didn't talk about last minute podcast is the thermogenic effect when you, when you release Nora norepinephrine. So that's, I keep going back to that because it's like you can't refute that. Steven Novella, no one know debunker, no skeptic, no, I don't care who you are. You can't. It's just, it's consistent in every type of cold exposure period. It's, it's, it's consensus. You release norepinephrine will. There always seems to be some sort of a rationalization with a lot of the debunking. Like whether it's the benefits of exercise, whether it's the benefits of cryotherapy. That's almost like a rationalization for not doing it.

Speaker 1:          09:07          It's like you're looking for an excuse to not do it and not really very objective that was, which was disturbing about it. It's like this is like you're poopooing something that's often people grape. Yeah, I, it was clear. I mean after I especially, especially after I did the two weeks of research. I mean I think there's a kind of mentality when you're. Sometimes people like to think I'm a deep thinker and I'm not, I am. I am intentionally. Like. Because if you get in this mentality of always debunking something, you're, it's like the spiral and you can't see the good. Like you can't keep an open mind to like get past. You're like, what's in your box that you know? And that's very dangerous. I think that blind spot it is. And there are a lot of scientists that I know they're very smart, extremely smart, but they are in that loop where it's like just they have to debunk and criticized and it's like, you know, at some point huge discoveries are made by like connecting the dots and like getting past that like, I mean you have to be critical.

Speaker 1:          10:06          Being critical is very important, but you also like, I think there's a certain threshold where you just start to like, you know, you get to this like spiral, but well it was also was infuriating about this as the data's out there. This is not like, it's not like there's no data. It's like he made a cursory examination of the evidence and what he chose to focus on was it was so subjective. It was focused on a study that tested muscle soreness, posts, exercise with cryotherapy. Well, actually the study that he referred to as a Meta analysis, and it was subjective, but it actually came to the conclusion that there were benefits, however it said more studies that needed to be done because there wasn't large enough sample sizes and the quality of data was poor because there were not double blinded placebo controlled clinical trials and I have to say to you so that, so they're actually what he resided in that article.

Speaker 1:          10:57          There was a positive effect of the cow, but the problem is is that because they followed it up with, oh well it's poor quality, basically poor science. The reality is is that you can't do a double blinded placebo controlled, controlled trial with cryotherapy. Like you're going to be cold and they're gonna be putting this chamber where there's like cold or you're not and you're gonna know, you know. So anyways, I thought that was ridiculous. I just like whatever. I'm in Oregon, I'm gonna. I'm going to read about this stuff because I know I've experienced it. There's definitely something going on and one of the things that happens is the norepinephrine and when you released, when you released that norepinephrine, it activates a pathway in, inside of your cells, um, that basically our causes, your energy metabolism, metabolism to ramp up because you're trying to generate heat, you want basically your body wants to heal.

Speaker 1:          11:49          Your body is saying, I don't want to die, I need to make heat. And so a couple of ways it can do that. One, it can shiver and shivering is when your muscles start to contract and that it requires energy for your muscles to like twitch. It's very, it's not very thermodynamically favorable. So you, it's not a good way to generate heat but you generate heat because you have to like ramp up to twitch. But then what happens after you've been exposed? And actually this happens to me because we did the crowd twice. The first time I did it, I was shivering. The entire time I was shivering. It was really crazy because I've never shivered like that in my life. But the second time I went in I did not shiver. And after reading about it, what happens is your body quickly adapt so you adapt.

Speaker 1:          12:30          And what happens is non shivering thermogenesis, so the nor epinephrin causes your Mitochondria, which are the energy producing little organelles inside of yourselves, what causes them in your, in your adipose tissue to like get activated. And it does this by increasing the expression of a gene called UCP, one which basically freaks your mitochondria out because your mitochondria are kind of like batteries, they're charged, they have a negative charge on the inside and a positive charge on the outside. Will you see p one totally uncouples that so that there's no more charge. And that charge is very important because when that charge is there, your body knows, okay, I've been making energy because the way you make the charge is by making energy. So when the charge goes away, your body's like, oh my God, I know energy. So it just starts to ramp up fat metabolism.

Speaker 1:          13:16          So it does that and you start to make more mitochondria. So you're, you're making more mitochondria in your fat cells. And this is often called Brown fat. Um, so you can actually, the reason it's called Brown fat is because when you look at a fat cell under the microscope, if it has more Mitochondria, then it looks Brown, so you actually start to burn fat and you have this thermogenic because you're burning fat. It's creating heat as a byproduct so you're warming your body, but it has this nice side effect of burning fat, which people like. And the more you expose yourself to the cold, the more you're browning your fat, the more you're increasing those mitochondria, your fats, which means the next time you're in the cold, you can tolerate it longer. So people that have been exposing themselves to cold, like yourself, when you're doing the Cryo, you know, often you actually can tolerate the colder for longer periods of time because you have more mitochondria in your fat cells.

Speaker 1:          14:05          And this allows you to then generate more heat. So, and this has been shown in people, people that have been exposed to a cold, that they have been shown to increase their, their, um, Brown adipose tissue. But like 38 percent, if they're exposed to 10 days of 50 degree air, like outside air, just regular air, 50 degrees all day, 10 days. So like six hours a day out and like, you know, New York in the winter or fall, I don't know, something like that being out there for six hours for 10 days in a row. Men were able to increase their brown adipose tissue by like 38 percent or something like that. Why people from the east coast or from the northeast? The move to California and then they go back during the winter, they go home. My blood gut too thin was really is there really is like a physical factor of your body not being accustomed to dealing with Colebra.

Speaker 1:          14:50          You adapt, you adapt. And that's what Brown adipose tissue. And that's really one cold. How cold got really popular. Popularized because people wanted to use it as a hack to lose weight, you know? So they were like, Oh, if I do these cold showers, I use it for the brain benefits because I noticed I feel really good and also more focused. So I like that. And a lot of people I've talked to have felt the same way. Um, but then I think the other part of this article was the, the effects of it blunting some of the strength training and you know, I talked about this in this report that I wrote or the in the podcasts that I released and it's so complicated I had to like sit there and literally just read for like two weeks to try to figure it out because you know, the problem is that exercise is a hormetic stress.

Speaker 1:          15:35          Cold is a hormetic stress. So exercise itself, you need some of the inflammation, you need the bad stuff to get the good stuff. That's how it works. But you know, the inflammation that's happening happens while you're exercising and up to one hour after, one hour after. That's when the whole hormetic response kicks in. And this has been shown in multiple studies. One hour seems to be when the anti inflammatory response kicks in. So you've generated the implementation and then now you've got the antiinflammatory effects. If you do a cold exposure within that hour after exercising, it's possible. You may blunt some of the inflammatory effects that the exercise is inducing because the cold is activating anti inflammatory genes too early. Now I don't know that for certain, but I do know that this study that showed there was one study that showed strength training. If you did it, there were, if you did see cryotherapy immediately, like immediately after a Cold War, it was actually cold water immersion, which is not the same as the Cryo cryo chamber that it blended some of the anabolic I'm signaling.

Speaker 1:          16:37          And so there was like some of the muscle mass was, was not gained, but you know, there's other studies that have been done that have shown for some reason. All the insurance guys, they always wait an hour. It's kind of weird. So what I'm wondering is if people that are doing this research like sit down, take a step back, you know, people are always in this. I got to publisher to publish, you know, was a real big publisher parish mentality in science where it's like your bread and butter depends on your publishing and so you're just constantly trying to get that data out there. But you really, I think things are so complicated just to sit down and take a look at everything that's out there and start to go wait a minute, there's lots of little details that need to be considered to design this trial correctly.

Speaker 1:          17:19          So I'm hoping that at least for those people doing strength training, that they'll do one where they actually wait until an hour because there's been other studies where there that um, strength to strength training in combination with cryotherapy done much later. Even the next day. There are actually benefits, performance benefits. Like they were able to do more of those leg curl things. I don't know what they called leg extensions. Those, you know. So, you know, I, I, I don't really know what's going on but at what I do know is that it seems as though it's very likely that doing the cryotherapy like immediately after and now. Then again, if you're, if you're talking about someone that's doing, like there's been studies that have been published showing that people that are doing two bouts of exercise. So they're like riding a bike and then they, they're waiting, whatever. Our 30 minutes and then they go and run or something.

Speaker 1:          18:08          If they do cold water immersion in between those, they actually have performance enhancements, but you know, if they, if they wait, I'm sorry, I have to do it between two bouts of exercise. Some of that's due to the fact that cold, the cold water, it seems to improve heart rate variability. It's actually been shown to improve it by like two to three fold. So heart rate variability is the change in oscillation between heartbeats and it's also, um, people, people judge a, the heart recovery from a workout. So as soon as you're done with an intense workout, the ability of your heart rate to lower immediately within minutes, that's like a marker of heart rate variability. And it's supposed to be good because you're able to deal with these stressful changes, you know, because when you're making cortisol or something, your heart starts racing more or some of these other stress hormones.

Speaker 1:          18:54          Uh, so it's been shown to improve that. And, and having, being able to have your heart rates slower right after a workout and then immediately going into a workout again, you can imagine there would be a performance enhancement with, with that. So there's also, there's a difference in the, the physiological response between cold water immersion and Cryo therapy, right? Well, it depends, you know, if you're there, there are differences in the ability for those two different modalities to extract heat from the body, know if we're talking about submerging ourselves and cold water up to our shoulders. Um, water or ice is a much better. It's much better at extracting heat from the body than error. Um, but surface area also plays a role and the end, the temperature change. So if you're sitting in cold water that's 57 degrees, um, that's not as cold as going into a minus 180 or whatever crowd chamber.

Speaker 1:          19:48          But you can also sit in the cold water for a lot longer. So I to do it for 15 minutes. I think that there has been a study that compared the norepinephrine release, 20 seconds at 40 degree water up to the shoulders is comparable to two minutes at a minus standard, something one 80 minus one 84, no epinephrin, but a lot of these effects are mediated from Nora Norepinephrine, but listened for 20 seconds at 40 to reverse those two minutes. So imagine, imagine staying in the water for five minutes in that and this has been shown, so if you have someone that stays in water 57 degree water for an hour, they increased their norepinephrine by fivefold instead of twofold. So you have a more robust response so it could be good, but it could be bad if you're talking about doing it right after a strength training session and jumping into cold water for five minutes.

Speaker 1:          20:39          That could. That could have some very potent anti inflammatory effects. So the best way to handle it would be to wait at least an hour, I think. Yeah, that makes sense. What about anti inflammatory markers in the blood? So there happened studies that have shown that cryotherapy lower c reactive protein, which would be an inflammatory marker, and then the glutathione related enzymes going up and also superoxide dismutase, that would be a marker for inflammation because there's also a decrease inflammation when you have more of those. So, so cryotherapy does. And then also, um, there's been mark measurements of TNF Alpha going down. Like I said, I'm also another marker that macrophages release macrophage inhibitory protein or something, some inflammatory molecule that's made. There's less of it when you, when Cold War, I can't remember if it was cold water immersion or cryotherapy, but it's cold exposure. So. And that was mediated through north and ignore epinephrin mediates a lot of stuff.

Speaker 1:          21:38          It's, it's mediating the brain effects. It's meeting in thermogenesis, it's antiinflammatory, it's anti-pain. People get injected with norepinephrine and their spine to alleviate a pain. Yes, because it's anti-inflammatory. Wow. Jesus. There's probably other things going on as well. So science just science, just the hard science. There's plenty of evidence that there's benefits to crow therapy. Oh yeah. So why would need write an article like that? I'm, like, I said, there's the, there's the bad article that was the anabolic blunting effects which was done immediately after exercise, which made a huge splash because it's like, Whoa, you're right, your gains. And then you have the, the, the hardcore, very skeptical people that are like, well, the quality of data, you know. Well the thing is, is that there's a large body of data and sometimes if you can't have a double blinded placebo controlled trial, then you have to look at mechanism.

Speaker 1:          22:33          You have to look at animal studies combined with human studies. You have to understand what's going on. You can't refute the norepinephrine. And we know that in orbit difference doing all these things, you know. So I think you just have to be very comprehensive, especially when the, when you know, there's the argument that the, there's no placebo controlled trials are too subjective, but there's lots of ways that it's not subjective. And this has been measured in people. People have measured c reactive protein, they've measured these enzyme activities, they've measured these inflammatory molecules and people also when animals, you know. So I, I'm confident when I say that there are absolutely health benefits from doing cold exposure for your brain, anti-inflammatory, for, um, for thermogenesis.
