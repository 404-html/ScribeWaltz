Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Five four, three, two, one, boom. And we're off. What's up brother? How are Ya? Good, good. Thanks for having me on my pleasure. Nice to meet you, man. You know, it's, it's funny that you just brought up doctor a Tia. You know, when we were, we were, you were saying that you download the podcast. You were saying, I got to get that guy on.

Speaker 2:          00:00:20       Yeah, yeah. It was funny. I was auto downloads and that one popped up and I remember thinking about a week before that I was like, well, when I, when we first scheduled this one, I was like, I told Joel about Doctor [inaudible]. He was one of the kind of first guys I really followed when I kind of dove in 10 of the high fat approach to nutrition. So, um, yeah, he's a fascinating guy who was a great, listen, I had to listen to it like twice.

Speaker 1:          00:00:40       Yeah. He's a weird guy. He's one of those guys. We talked to them and you think, oh, this is a good, normal, really nice guy. And then as he starts getting into the medical aspect of things, you go, oh, okay. You're a fucking super genius.

Speaker 2:          00:00:52       Yeah. Yeah. He's tricks you. Yeah. I remember one of the first things he ever said that really kind of resonated with me was I think someone was asking him about like, what the facts are or where the key to genic die in terms of like micro nutrients and what maybe he'd be missing based on kind of like that normal profile of what you're supposed to get. And he was just like, you know, it's, it's interesting because most of those studies in recommendations are based off of basically a standard American diet or higher carb Diet. So he's like, well, you might not need the same, we need to do more. And he's always looking to kind of push the envelope a bit. So cool guests for sure.

Speaker 1:          00:01:27       Yeah. And you know, I'm fascinated by you and I'm fascinated by anybody who does the kind of shit that you do. I mean, please explain to people all the different ultra marathons you've done and what you've accomplished.

Speaker 2:          00:01:44       Yeah. You know, it's, it's interesting because like, I still kind of see myself as a pretty average runner because like, um, I mean I competed in high school and made state cross country and state track and that kind of thing, um, for a small school. And then I went to a small division three school and was, you know, pretty much, you know, average amongst a real good program at the d three level. And, uh, I always just did kind of like running longer though. So, um, like once I got done with college, I kind of decided, well, let's, let's see what's longer than that. Some of those traditional like collegiate races have like five k to 10 kilometers and a, and I started kind of just dabbling that stuff. And then in 2010, I think I actually did my first ultra marathon, you know, partly because I was just like looking around and there turned out to be one in the state.

Speaker 2:          00:02:29       I was, I was living in Wisconsin at the time and, uh, there was one that, uh, was kind of in my neck of the woods and I actually had just decided to go back to Grad school and that one had a thousand dollar prize purse on it. And I was like, you know what, if I, if I can win that thousand bucks, go a long way during Grad school. So I did that one and I ended up winning it and it, uh, it definitely hooked me. It was like the type of thing where I was like, I want to do more of these. And, um, by 2011, I kind of jumped all lane at the end of the year and ended at three 50. And I think it was about a nine week timeframe. And, uh, it's so crazy. Yeah. And I mean, it gets crazier. There's, there's some freaks out there.

Speaker 2:          00:03:08       There's guys who will do like a couple and the weekend and stuff like that. So, I mean, it's, it never ends. Um, but yeah, you know, it was one of those things where after that I was totally hooked. So what is it that got you hooked? Um, you know, it had to be partly just a little bit of success. You know, I wasn't necessarily used to winning. So like, I mean I've had good races and good times relative to what you probably see like in an average person. But you know, when I went to like a competitive 5k competitive marathon or something like that, um, you know, I wasn't going to win unless it was kind of a local race. So kind of finding, you know, it's like anything, I guess you kind of gravitate to what you feel you're good at and then that kind of Piques your interest.

Speaker 2:          00:03:48       Um, so that was part of it. The other part was just I really enjoyed doing the long run. Like when you break up kind of like a training week, you can have like a variety of different things. You've got like kind of, you know, base level runs, you've got specific workouts for the distance and then most training programs are going to have a long run once a week. And that was the one that was always my favorite. So wrapping my head around doing a bunch of those a week instead of just one was, was really it kind of appealing to me. And when you're putting that much time into whatever you're training for, it's, I think important to enjoy it. So being able to kind of enjoy the training process a lot was really appealing to me. Um, and uh, and then it's just the variables when you're out there for that long, there's so many variables to consider and it's like, it's a blast for me to kind of like work through those, plan for those and then adjusted them on the fly when you're out there and, you know, things inevitably go wrong or things pop up that you didn't expect.

Speaker 2:          00:04:40       So it's, it's, uh, it's just, uh, it's, it's kind of hard to explain, but it's, it's weird. One of the things in ultra marathon running that people will always say is like, they'll have a race and even if they have a bad race, say like, I'm never doing one of these again. And then the next day they're on, uh, on the Internet looking for another race. So it's this weird thing about it that you don't really know until you do it, but it, it sucks you in. That's the case with a lot of people only talk about things that are like,

Speaker 1:          00:05:03       they have to suffer through. You know, I've heard that when guys talk about like those extreme hikes, you know, when they, you know, like they do that, you know, that one that goes from Georgia all the way to Maine, you know that it's insane. Like what does that call the Appalachian trail? Yep. Yeah. Did they say, I've never fucking do that again. And then they're like, okay, what other, what other hikes can I go? It's just once the pain, the physical pain dies down. There's something about that challenge that stimulates in people like you and people that are into these really long distance things. Like there's something about distance, there's something about like, like you were saying like you weren't the best runner in high school or college, right? But there's something about the mind of an ultra marathoner. It's a different mind. The purse, the type of person that can run a hundred miles, 200 miles, 238 miles, those type of people, they're different people. And there's like, there's a strength, a mental strength in the ability

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       to just keep going on and on and on. That I'm absolutely fascinated with. Yeah. You know, it is interesting too, because it's a, in the sport's grown a bit, quite a bit in the last decade or so, but it's still very much kind of a niche group. And then when you kind of hang out in that group, you start to kind of normalize it a little bit, I think. So then you start thinking like, oh, a hundred miles, it's just what we do. And then you, you know, he actually tried to like separate yourself from the fact that you've done a few of those are separate yourself from the fact that you've been hanging out with other people who are doing it and you realize, oh, this is actually kind of a weird thing to kind of do as, as a human nowadays. It's very weird. How many of these things of you?

Speaker 2:          00:06:34       One, uh, I don't know how many I've won it. It's, I think I've done just shy of 50 total now. Um, you know, everything from 50 kilometers to the furthest I've done is 200 kilometers, which is about 125 miles. Um, yeah, I, I'd have to look to see how many I've won. It's, it's, it's, it's really goofy cause when you start getting into the longer stuff, like a hundred miles and beyond, you start, at least in my training program, you start to kind of pick smaller races to kind of use as training runs. Um, and some of it I think is just because for me, if I'm going to go out and do like a 30 mile or 40 mile training run or something like that, it's kind of tedious to do that by herself and then plan all the logistics of it. So if there's a race nearby and that's not too hard to get to, it's easy just to sign up for that, go and do that.

Speaker 2:          00:07:20       So some of those, you know, I'll, I'll win if they're, if they're small enough, even though I'm not necessarily trying to go forward, you know, go all out so to speak, cause I'm hoping to recover kind of and, and get back into training. Um, you'll pace yourself at one of these local races maybe. Yeah. You know, the way I described it is, um, and this is, this is a real hard thing for a lot of people to do. I think it's a, like you go into a race saying this is going to be a moderately difficult long run. Uh, so maybe a little faster than what I would do if I was just going to do it by myself, like on supported, that sort of thing. And then I always tell myself 80% is the hardest you can go if you want to be able to come back and start training on time to meet the actual goal or the race.

Speaker 2:          00:08:00       Um, so when I do those, it's like, it's one of those things where like, you know, who knows, someone might show up that's, that's like as fast as you or maybe a little slower than your normal. And if they're deciding to just hammer it that day, they might beat you and you gotta be okay with that. Um, the competitive part of you flare up though? Well, yeah, it does. And that's the hardest part. And that's, I think the main reason why some people won't do that approach because there are certainly people who just, they stay away from races and less, it's there a race and they just say, I'm, if I'm going to do a long run, I'll do it on my own and, and, and, you know, not do that. Or, you know, there's certainly, I'm sure folks who do it and then they'd get caught up and then ended up leaving there a race out on, on the b race, I guess, so to speak. So, um, yeah, it's interesting. It's, uh, it's kind of a, a sport that I think is still a lot to learn, which I think is actually the case for a lot of things that, you know, even things that are well established, you know, there's always something to learn

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       or new things to pick up on. Well, it's one of those things, right when we went, once someone runs a hundred miles and then a bunch of other people start doing it, like you said, it almost becomes normalized and then people start to try to push that boundary. Now I've been hearing, talk about the woman candace who runs the Moab to 40. Yeah, yeah. They're talking about doing a 500 I heard that. I was like, here, you're out of your fucking mind. People are going to die, but maybe that'd be normal in five years and we'll get used to like four or five day races. Yes. So it's really fascinating. It took me a couple of years to do this before I got into the sport, but once I was in it for a couple of years, I kind of did a little, a little, a little research to see like what the deal was with them.

Speaker 3:          00:09:33       Some of this stuff. And the, the funny thing is that type of a distance isn't even unheard of. They actually, I forget what the book is called, but they actually had in Madison Square Garden, they used to host a six day event where guys and Gals, I'm not sure if gals were doing it back then, but um, guys for sure we're going there and seeing how far they could run in six days. And uh, yeah, I know crazy. And uh, I think if I remember right, they would actually, people were betting on them that way and so they'd fill it up. Like people would come and watch us like spectacle. It was in the late 18 hundreds I think is when they started it. I'm not sure. Oh, here it is. Six Day cycling, the six day grind at Madison Square Garden Valley ranch. Oh Wow. Look at this map to some crazy person decided to leave the bike at home.

Speaker 3:          00:10:20       I guess this is super old. We're looking at this on youtube folks. It says six day cycling, the six day grind at Madison Square Garden, and so it's just a track and these people are, this is old timey shit. This looks like the 30s right. That guy just went down and so they're, they're just riding their bike for six days. Oh Shit. When they wipe out. Oh my God, they probably a terrible breaks back then, right? Yeah. That was their feet probably right, or the railing. Yeah. Yeah. So this is so endurance sports like this or nothing new. Yeah. It's actually fascinating when you like kind of look into it because nowadays in the United States, the trail running scene is definitely way bigger than like the road running or certainly the track, the track scene, but that wasn't always the case. If you look back and be like the 70s and eighties there was a pretty big surge and ultra marathon running a for flat bass stuff.

Speaker 3:          00:11:13       That's where we see a lot of the, the records coming from. Um, so that's like a track and you run as far and long as you can on a track like track or a road or really flat road. I had goggins on David Gardner. Yeah. And he was talking about the first time he did one was on a track. Okay. Ran In circles on a track, which is almost got to be more taxing for your mind cause you're just seeing the same shit over and over and over again. Yeah. It's really fascinating because I've done, I've done both. I've done a hundred miles on the trail and I've done a hundred miles on a 400 meter track. And uh, the fascinating thing is it is like what you said, it's almost a different event where mentally you're doing everything you can on that track to kind of separate yourself from the actual

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       environment and envision yourself being somewhere else. You know, looking forward a little things to kind of not necessarily be thinking too far and advanced cause that can get overwhelming. Whereas when I'm out on the trails, it's like you're using a pretty pristine, beautiful area and you can kind of just take it as it comes and say, Oh cool, now I get to see that, or this is a neat area, or I like this section. And you look, you look forward to that kind of diversity. Whereas on the track it's, you know, you see it once and you've seen it every time. Um, and then it, you know, it just kind of beats you up mentally from that side of things. Um, but then, you know, there's other things about that too that, that help out. Like logistically, when you're on a track for foreigner meters, you bring out one person, you put everything you might possibly want on a little table.

Speaker 2:          00:12:34       And if I want something, I say, Hey, can I get that 400 numbers later? I have it. And even, even if we mess it up, I'll get it 400 years after that. So yeah, we're, whereas, you know, the trails, it depends. They've gotten a lot better with aid stations as the sport's grown. Um, but like, you know, you mess up your aid station or if you get caught up in the moment and just blow through it and don't take care of yourself, you might have to suffer for an hour plus before you get help again. So that's where it kind of gets a little different I think logistically when you're on the trails versus versus on the road. And um, but, but yeah, it's, it's kind of a different thing. The track is interesting too in the sense that you're essentially making that same exact motion, exact motion, the whole way.

Speaker 2:          00:13:14       So like there's certain areas of your body that fatigue, um, and they don't get a break on the turn and just running flat, like running flat. You're going to kind of localize some of the way you stimulate your muscles or your gate is going to be pretty similar throughout. Whereas when you're on the trails, like you might be going on a slight incline, a steep incline, slight decline, a little bit of flat, some rolling and all kinds of things in between. And then trails can be kind of undulating. So you're just kind of moving all that force is around your legs a little more than you would be when you're running on a flat surface. So, you know, it's one of the things that I always tell like my coaching clients and, and myself when I'm planning for something, it's like if you really want to meet your full potential, like specificity is king.

Speaker 2:          00:13:53       You need to be on that environment in the environment you're going to race on and really get your body used to kind of that type of a motion. And um, it makes it a little more interesting when you're doing a track race cause that means some kind of long runs on a track. So, um, you're kind of balancing doing just enough to get ready for it and not doing too much so that when you get to the race you're like, screw this. I've done too much of this already. I don't want to see another loop. Um, that's kind of a, an interesting concept.

Speaker 1:          00:14:17       It's, it's interesting to me too that you're, if you're planning to run a hundred miles, like what you were saying about running these shorter races as a training run, which makes sense because how else are you going to prepare for a hundred miles? Like if he just decided to just go out and run a hundred miles, you'd have to like map it out. Like how far is a hundred miles? Where am I going to park? Where am I going to put water?

Speaker 2:          00:14:38       And Yeah. And then people will also kind of get like, forget about the aspect of just all the stuff surrounding the race that you can kind of fine tune when you're doing a race as a kind of training run where like, you know, usually you're going to travel a little bit for stuff like, um, so you're probably going to stay in a hotel the night before you're going to, you have to wake up early in the morning and have to get yours, your, your gear ready. And so it's Kinda like going through that process of what you're gonna have to do on race day. So then when you're big race comes up, you're like, okay, I've done this three or four times in the last six months, so I know what I'm doing

Speaker 1:          00:15:10       now. What's different between you and a lot of guys, and this is one of the reasons why I wanted to talk to you about this, is that you, you are on a fat burning diet. You're essentially, you're on a ketogenic diet and running these races.

Speaker 2:          00:15:23       Yeah. You know, it's, it's a little interesting because the way I kind of the, at least the way I came into it, like I explored the ketogenic diet mainly because I started noticing some things. Oh, sorry. No worries. Yeah. Yeah. So I started kind of exploring the ketogenic diet back in late 2011 because I started noticing some, some goofy things going on with my body from, from the, from the high level of training and then, and then the racing. And um, that was right around that same time I did those three 50 milers and nine notice. Uh, I would wake up like three or four times at night and then like, I'd have to like pee all the time at night and I'd have like swelling in my ankles and stuff a lot. I'll just like huge energy swings throughout the day. Like I would, you know, I was, I was a teacher at the time, so I remember thinking like every day at like one or two o'clock, I could have laid down and take a nap on spot if I had had the opportunity to.

Speaker 2:          00:16:16       So it was just like a lot of weird things that I thought was pretty abnormal for 25 year old male at the time. Um, and so it was kind of becoming clear to me that what I was doing was either unsustainable or the way I was doing it was unsustainable. And you know, I was really intrigued by the sport and I didn't really want to necessarily back off of that if I didn't have to. So that's when I kind of started to explore nutrition and diet and things like that. And, um, I was very much following what I would have considered a healthy diet before that. At the time it was, it was high carbohydrate, but it was like what you would think of as a healthy high carbohydrate diet with like what was a normal meal. Um, you know, I wake up and I usually go for a run and then have like some oatmeal, raisins, maybe some fruit or something like that, some, some eggs or something with, with that in the morning.

Speaker 2:          00:17:06       So not junk food, just know it was clean. It was like clean, like, you know, you know what you say, they say like get your whole grains, fruits, vegetables, that sort of thing. I definitely, you know, focused heavily on that and made sure I wasn't eating like junk, junk food. I wasn't going through fast food restaurants or eating oreos and bond bonds and that sort of thing. So, um, so it was kinda interesting to me to think like, okay, I didn't really realize that it was necessarily the nutritional side of things. Like, it wasn't, it wasn't like a big slap in the face and the sense that, oh, I just got to cut out the junk. Cause like according to most people, I wasn't eating junk. I was eating really good food. Um, so, you know, that's when I Kinda got introduced to some folks, like a doctor Valek and doctor Finney who were kind of, I guess, I guess the pioneers of like the, this latest way of, of kind of the high fat approach.

Speaker 2:          00:17:54       And, um, you know, they were, I started reading their books, listening to podcasts and things like that. And, and it, you know, it was interesting because I was, I was training upwards of 20 hours a week at the time. And you know, I started kind of thinking like, uh, how much time am I going to invest in, in just running, you know, how can I kind of kill two birds with one stone? And, and that's kind of when I discovered podcasts and thought, this is sweet. I can learn something and train at the same time. Um, and so I just kind of like, went all in on listening to a bunch of podcasts and stuff like that. And I'm actually one of your previous guests. Uh, Ben Greenfield was one of the first podcasts I really kind of did a deep dive into and he was always kind of like a ruling out stuff that was like kind of new or cutting edge. So like, um, he definitely had a lot of information there. And, uh, I was facing mania, don't take his advice on what he does with his dick shooting stem. So when it was dick, he's turning himself into a Guinea pig, but he's an odd duck.

Speaker 2:          00:18:52       But yeah, he definitely had a lot of info from guys like Doctor Finian, Doctor Walik and uh, and I was lucky to meet those guys too on a couple occasions. And, um, with, with doctor Valek, I've done some podcasts with him and certainly in like exchange emails and stuff when I've had questions. And, uh, so I kind of just tested it out, you know, I was like, what's the worst that can happen? I can just, I can always go back. You know, like it's not like I have to stick to this to for the rest of my life if it's not something your issues were swelling and energy and why did you attribute that to your diet? Like what was making you think that as you'd died and that was doing that too. Yeah. So you know, I wasn't sure. I thought, I thought for sure that something I was doing was wrong and get your blood work done, check your hormone levels, all that stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:19:33       Yeah. You know, I didn't have probably as much blood work done as I would've liked you to really be like look at stuff and see like the way I look at blood work is if you're doing it regularly, like often enough and not changing things, that's what you're going to see the most. Cause you're going to see changes versus just like, oh, I'm chronically low in this or I'm always low in this, but it doesn't seem to be an issue. Uh, but you know, there was no big red flags on my blood work. Like nothing that would have said said like thyroid disease, right. Nothing, nothing quite that wrong. And you know, it wasn't like the wheels were coming off at that point. There were, these were small things that I kind of associated like nagging things. They, they were like things I could get through.

Speaker 2:          00:20:11       Um, but they weren't ideal. So, you know, I'm, I've kind of been a curious person like my whole life. So I was, um, it was just looking to kind of optimize I guess more or less than, and I didn't know if it was gonna work. I was, was terrified that I'd find out it wasn't and then I would have to stop running as much. And at the time I was like, that doesn't sound like what I want to do. So, um, this was just something I decided to explore first. Um, and it's, it's really goofy because like I've certainly evolved and kind of how I use it from that. When I first started, when I, when I first started, I went like really kind of really low carb. Like that clinical ketosis level where you read about where they're like 50 grams of carbohydrates are last.

Speaker 2:          00:20:54       And, you know, I did that for about, I think it was like four to six weeks and, um, I didn't have as hard of a time as what I think I've, I've, I've seen some people have with it. You know, you have people talking about everything from what the Keto flu to just like feeling really lethargic for awhile before that kind of metabolic switch flips. Um, what I kind of noticed was, um, I felt really good doing like really like low level type mundane task, just like day to day work and things like that. But like maybe every second or third day I'd go for a run and just feel awful. And, um, I kind of knew enough about it that I thought, okay, let's give this a solid four weeks before I make any judgments on whether that's going to be something that sticks around or not.

Speaker 2:          00:21:38       And you know, after about that point, my energy level's kind of normalized. Um, and then, you know, I was, so at that point I was like excited. I was like, this is sweet and well, I should have mentioned too, like during that process I started sleeping through the night again, which was like kind of really an eye opening thing for me. Um, because usually like I'd wake up at least three times. What do you attribute that to? Um, you know, I, I don't know for sure of, but, uh, you know, it could be anything from just the amount of stress I was causing on my body from kind of two angles from the training plus like, you know, like I don't want to demonize carbohydrates because I think they have a place, I think they're a great tool. I just think like, the, the question everyone should ask is at what level do they become kind of a margin to diminishing returns for you.

Speaker 2:          00:22:25       And you know, what I think was likely happening is that, you know, I was reaching past that margin at diminishing returns and, um, it was causing more stress than what my body was, was able to tolerate and that was causing cortisol spikes or something like that, that was waking me up at night. Um, but you know, who knows really like it's a, it all I know is the only thing at that time I changed because my diet, and we should probably point out that this is not universal, that everybody's diet is going to affect them differently for sure. Fine with carbohydrates. Use a lot of people out there that, you know, high carbohydrate diet and they have zero issues with it whatsoever. And it's, that's one of the weirdest things about people, you know, that we are so variable depending upon your ancestry, you know, what part of the world that they evolved.

Speaker 2:          00:23:11       Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's fascinating to me because I mean, I'll look at, folks are doing complete opposite of why am and there they're doing just fine. Um, and it's, you know, then I'll look at some folks too that are doing the opposite of me and they're doing just fine for a while and then they ultimately start noticing the same kind of things I did and then they can clean it up. Uh, so it is kind of it, I think at the end of the day you just gotta be kind of honest with yourself. And you know, some people I think are really, really robust and they can, they can hit their body with that high octane fuel of carbohydrate like day in and day out at a high level. And it doesn't seem to bother him much. But you know, other people I've yet think just that it can kind of, it's like playing with rocket fuel a little bit where you know, a little bit can be great and not too much of it can kind of burn you up a little bit.

Speaker 2:          00:23:55       So you're saying that you started off at like 50 grams of carbohydrates a day, the grills trick, Ketosis Diet, what did you eventually move to? Um, it, so the way I call, as I peered eyes it, so like when I look at my year, you're, you can pick out a week where I'm kind of in peak training and then pick out a week where I'm kind of in like a recovery phase or off season. And it looks like two completely different lifestyles. So my first thought after kind of like working through the cold ketogenic approach, um, cause I should add too, like, um, once I got like feeling good about that, I started adding back speed workouts and things like that and I definitely noticed that I was missing kind of that last year. Like it was a lot more difficult to go out and really throttle down. Like I could run all day at a slow pace.

Speaker 2:          00:24:39       But if I decided to go out on the track and do like 400 meter repeats at like a really fast, like a really fast pace, um, it was really hard to kind of, to be able to do that. That's a common complaint. Robb Wolf, you know Rob, Oh rob wolf had a similar issue. He's gotten like very heavily into Jujitsu and he was telling me that he just can't stick to that 50 grams of carbohydrates a day and still have the energy to go hard. Does, does, do you notice robb wolf work out more than one time a day? I do not know. Um, he looked very fit though. I'm not sure what his, uh, what his schedule is, but I know he works out very hard and if he's doing Jujitsu, this is really, it's very difficult to do Jujitsu any other way than hard.

Speaker 2:          00:25:20       Sure. Yet he says one thing I've always been curious about too and you know, I'm not, I'm not trying to come, come on here and say like everyone should switch to doing what I do. I mean I think you should follow your own your own set, your own personal self and if it'd be honest with yourself, you feel great, do what you're doing. If you don't then probably look to change something. But like one thing I'm always looking at nower suspecting is that like it's more about the recovery between efforts than it is about the intensity of the effort or the duration of the effort in terms of how much carbs you need to bring back or want to bring back. Because I've also had circumstances where like I'll do like a big workout or a race or something like that and then I'll go really easy for like a week and during that week I'll go like super strict to Quito.

Speaker 2:          00:26:04       Um, cause I'm recovering, I'm not doing anything intense, I'm not doing anything too long. Um, so that's, that's the point in my training where I kind of say, all right, let's get rid of the start the fast acting fuel sources. I don't need them right now. And reset that whole fat adaptation thing. You feel like you, the fast acting fuel sources of carbohydrates, you only really need them when you're pushing hard, right? When you're really running fast. Yeah. And I actually think it's, it's when you're doubling down on those on a regular basis. So like if you're working out really hard for like 45 minutes to an hour a day, I think you can probably get away with almost a ketogenic or like a really low carbohydrate approach because you're giving yourself like 23 plus hours between sessions for your body to kind of a restock glycogen stores from other areas.

Speaker 2:          00:26:46       Like, you know, from fat and proteins and things like that. I think when you start getting into a system where you're like, myself, I'm doing two days a lot, and then sometimes one of those is a speed session. That's when I feel like I need to bring some of the carbohydrate back. And I think it's probably just to get some of the glycogen and a little faster rate because that is going to replenish your glycogen stores faster as a carbohydrate then like a fat or a protein probably would. So how many grams of carbohydrates to do with having to deal with that? Um, when I'm in like peak training, which is about 20 hours a week of running strength training and mobility type stuff, you know, I'll probably let myself get up to like 15 to 25% of my intake from carbohydrate. Um, what do you think that is in grams a flu?

Speaker 2:          00:27:29       It probably, it depends a lot on like what I actually do because I don't count calories very often. I used to just to Kinda like see what was going on and then I kinda got intuitive with it. Uh, Graham Wise, you know, it's probably anywhere from like two to 300 maybe. And then when I'm in those phases of training, it's really intense in terms of like just a, or I shouldn't say intense, it's just really tedious and the amount of time and energy required for it now or you blood monitoring at the time you checking your millimolar? I am sometimes like when I'm like, when I get curious about that type of stuff or I've done it in the past. I've actually, what I did originally is I got the blood ketone monitor and they also got one of those key tonics. But like it's like this little usb thing and then you blow into it.

Speaker 2:          00:28:18       And is that accurate? Um, I think there's, I think there's varied results. I think they've gotten a lot better with it. Um, but what I did is I actually measured my blood ketone and then I would use that and I tried to find kind of like if mine was matching what that thing would say. So I kind of had an, I got it to where I kind of had an idea of where certain ranges on that thing would kind of indicate whether I was in Ketosis or not. Um, so like I very much is coming out of ketosis during peak training. Like when I would, especially when I would get up to two, 300 grams of carbohydrate, I would come out of ketosis. Uh, and I probably go back into ketosis throughout that, for that phase. And when you said go back in and come out, like what kind of time period are you talking about?

Speaker 2:          00:29:00       Uh, it, the time period was more indicative about what I kind of ate during it too. Like if I did, if, if, if I did or I shouldn't say what I like, how I kind of structured those two to 300 grams of carbohydrate. Like if I did like a big bolus of it in one meal, I'd get back into ketosis a little quicker because then I wouldn't come back to the carbohydrates again for a while. Very inside the day. Yeah. Yeah. Like, I would still like if I, and here's where it got kind of interesting I guess is I do a lot of my, the heaviest bulk of my training in the morning. So I typically wake up and have some coffee with like coconut milk or heavy whipping cream or something like that. And then, uh, you know, go for my run. So then when I get back from a run, you know, it might be two hours, sometimes even three.

Speaker 2:          00:29:45       And, uh, you know, at that point I had just slept for eight to 10 hours. Then, you know, by the time we got done with my run, you know, I hadn't had probably had an e I had essentially done like a small intermittent fast for the most part. Um, so like, even when I had the higher amounts of carbohydrates, I'd find myself going back into the coat ketosis at the end of something like that sometimes. Um, but really it was, to me, it wasn't necessarily a question of whether I was in Ketosis or not because that really wasn't important to me. Um, like it's is important. Exactly. Yeah. And what I wanted out of this approach was, um, I wanted to be able to rely on my body to body to burn high levels of fat when I needed it to. But I also wanted to be metabolically flexible enough where if I needed to hit the gas pedal, I could do that as well.

Speaker 2:          00:30:33       Um, and I think that's where people get a little uh, uh, confused are up in arms or something because there's not a whole lot of studies that kind of look at that specifically. Like, can you do that or can you not do that? Some people think it's kind of an all or nothing thing where you either get really fat adapted or you get really carved dependence and then everything else is kind of like, you know, this gray area that you can't really get into. But that's not my experience. My experience has been that like I can get the cure, here's my kind of litmus test. If I can go out for like a four hour, even five hour run with no fuel other than water and electrolytes, then I'm fat adapted enough. I don't need to get any more fat adapted than that because I can eat during the race and everyone else is going to be, so like, I don't really need to get more fat adapted that from a performance standpoint.

Speaker 2:          00:31:19       Um, so when I get to that point, then it's like, how many, how many carbohydrates can I bring back to kind of give me that extra nudge or that extra fuel substrate. Um, have you ever tried mixing exogenous ketones with carbohydrates? Um, not, was talking about that and doing steroids. It was incredible. Yeah. He's, he's a maniac. He's a maniac yet there's a, who else was it? Was it dominic d'agostino is playing around with that stuff quite a bit too, or he might've helped. Uh, he might've helped, uh, with the, the creation of some of that stuff. I know there was a, I'd have to look back in my emails and stuff, but I actually had a, there was a guy who was doing a real clinical version of the exaggerators ketones and, um, he had sent me one a while back to kind of do a little test for him.

Speaker 2:          00:32:05       And, uh, it was like just this little canister of exaggerates ketone and you wanted me to kind of check my ketones when I woke up in the morning, take that test at 15 minutes later and then test again after my run a ketone ester. Yeah, I think so. Super potent stuff. Taste like Dick Matt Brown brought some of that in and it's like woo. Yet, did you test your ketones when you took it at her? No, I did and I didn't have a monitor on me, but it tasted terrible. But I felt great after it was over. And you have to take it with a glucose. Yeah. Yeah. See I think that's, maybe that's where I messed up. But uh, um, besides that, like my ketone levels shot up. I woke up that morning, I think I was at like 1.0 millimoles or something like that. I took that exogenous ketone, um, and 15 minutes later and I test I was a 3.7 millimoles.

Speaker 2:          00:32:53       Wow. So it was like, okay, stuff works. Yeah, it worked. But I don't know. Here's what I, here's my question is with that stuff from a performance standpoint is like it's people are looking at that kind of, I think more like an light where it's like I take this on top of my energy source, whereas that's actually an energy source, a fairly potent one to. So like when I'm out there racing and I'm trying to kind of limit, I'm not trying to eat a certain amount so that I kind of keep that energy where I want it, but I'm also trying not to go overboard because I don't want digestive stress. Um, that's interesting. So like as you're running, you have to maintain like a certain amount of food and your system, but you don't want to have a large meal. Yeah, yeah. Cause like basically the way it seemed to simply put it like digestion requires blood volume, you know, to move into your gut and like digest the food.

Speaker 2:          00:33:47       So when you're running, especially when it's hot, your body is also trying to use your, your blood volume for muscle function and cooling and things like that. So by kind of introducing another use for that blood volume, your body's probably is running out of resources to kind of make all those things run smoothly. Um, which is why a lot of times an ultra marathons people find out, like they have the worst luck with like throwing up and stomach issues when it gets really hot out because their body's got to go double down on the cooling side of things with the blood volume. And then it's like, well, something's got to give. So it just picks up everything you put in your stomach. Oh Wow. Yeah. So, you know, is there a way to medicate that, uh, eat less? That's it. So when you, if you're running like, what's the size portion?

Speaker 2:          00:34:29       Like what do you, what would you say if you're doing a hundred miler? Yeah. And you have to pause for fuel. Um, you know, I'll, I'll typically aim for around a hundred to 200 calories an hour when I'm doing an doing a hundred miler. And to kind of put that in perspective. When I was a high carb, I was aiming for three, four, and sometimes even 500 calories an hour. So when I kind of went into the approach where fat was my primary fuel source, the the need for that carbohydrate essentially got cut in half if not more. And for me that's a win. As long as energy levels are the same because it means I have to eat less during the race as one last logistic thing, one less potential stomach issue. Um, so what, what's a typical meal? A typical meal like when you're running?

Speaker 2:          00:35:12       Oh, while I'm running, I, you know, I usually stick to like, uh, um, uh, like water based stuff. So like I'll use a product called, um, x endurance fuel five, and it's essentially like a really, really high level sports drink, um, with like a varying, um, it's got, it's, it's carbohydrate based and I can tell you why I use carbohydrates instead of fats during a race in a minute too if you want. Um, but it's like five different types of kind of that release at varying points. So you get some that's kind of a little quick jolt and others that are more sustained, like kind of like a sweet potato type of a release. Um, so I'll be just trickling that in. So like if I'm doing like a hundred miler and let's say I'm aiming for like 30 to 40 ounces of water, uh, per hour to kind of stay on top of hydration, I'll put, um, you know, to like a hundred to 200 calories with that stuff in that water.

Speaker 2:          00:36:02       So then I'm kind of killing two birds with one stone and getting my fuel in as well as hydrating at the same time. So what, and why you taking carbohydrates while you're running instead of fats? Yeah. So that's, that's the other thing like in, and I see this as, as somewhat of a, I don't know if it's an issue necessarily, but it's an interesting thing for that at the very least is when you, when I talked to folks who are like really into the high fat approach, you know, some of them are like zero carb or like really ketogenic all the time, 24, seven. Uh, there'll be taking in like fat sources during a race. And I've never understood that. Um, just because when you look at your body's energy systems during a race, like you have your glycogen stores and then you have body fat and I think a lot of people kind of get misled and they think, oh, I'm a really lean runner so I can't rely on body fat.

Speaker 2:          00:36:49       When in reality, even the leanest endurance athletes have enough body fat to get through an endurance race. Like even if your 4% 5% body fat at your leanest you, that's a much bigger fuel source then your glycogen reserves. So when I'm doing a race, I've got enough fat to take care of the fat metabolizing portion of that energy, a requirement for the race. What I might run out of is those glycogen stores, which are really small in comparison. So I'm trying to just slowly trickle in the, the, the sugar or the carbohydrate during a race. I'm just enough to kind of keep my glycogen stores where I want to be so I can hit the gas if I need to. Um, but not at the level where it's going to cost stomach distress or compromise or heavily compromised. My body's like willingness or ability to burn fat either.

Speaker 2:          00:37:34       That's fascinating. So like as you're running, your body could switch back and forth between fats and carbohydrates because you're so fat adapted. Yeah. And I, you know, it's actually probably happening like simultaneously, it's just that different rates like, like someone who's really fat adapted, they could be running kind of the same effort and the fat after person might be like burning 80% fat, 20% carbohydrate and the carb dependent person might be like a 50, 50 split. So that carved dependent person is going to exhaust our glycogen stores a lot quicker or they're going to have to fuel themselves at a much higher rate to make up for that deficit. And um, when you look at like how difficult that is, cause you know, some of these, especially some of these mountain races where you're running uphill, it's like you, you might be burning 800 plus calories an hour and it's really hard.

Speaker 2:          00:38:19       I'm all right. Yeah. Uh Huh. Yeah. And it's really hard to replace that on the fly if you have those running uphill one. So I would think that's a much more difficult race. Yeah, I mean it's a different setup. It's, you know, it's one of those things where I'm pretty new to that actually. Like, um, most of my ultra running career folks, moral flat stuff. And part of that just because I've lived in a lot of flat areas and like I was kind of saying earlier, if you really want to nail race you have to be specific. So I learned kind of early, probably around like 2013 or so. That was in my best interest to make my peak racist flat ones if I really wanted to meet my full potential. Um, now I live in Phoenix, so I've got a lot more access to mountains.

Speaker 2:          00:38:57       You, I can get on the trails and the and do some significant climbing right out my back door. So, um, I've certainly been able to practice that more and as I've gotten more competent at it, I do recognize like, oh, it's not quite as hard as I thought it was originally because I was going into it essentially. Undertrained whereas now it's like I go into it, I'm like, Oh, I'm, I'm more adjusted to this. So I mean, it's still hard. Like going uphill is hard no matter how you skin it, but it's like, it's one of those things where if you kind of figure out the pace, it shouldn't be any more hard. Like it should be just as hard to run flat because you're going to have to run faster. Um, and it's just, then it just comes down to I think, the right training and, you know, pacing everything.

Speaker 2:          00:39:37       Right. So interesting. You're saying you're living in Phoenix, do you run the summer in Phoenix because Phoenix is fucking insanely hot. So I moved there in January. So good wake up call comes, you're like, whoa. Yeah, it'll be, it'll be warm. Um, I actually kinda like it because right now I'm training for the western states 100 and that's in, it starts in squaw valley and ends in Auburn, California. Uh, and they go through like these four canyons that get, can get brutally hot, like 110 plus some years. Um, and like it's like a vest. We have water bottles attached to or anything. Yup. Yeah. That stuff has come such a long way since I started the sport. I remember when I first started it was pretty primitive type stuff. And now the, the sport is, I think through hiking plays a big role in this too has gotten so popular, are popular enough where now companies are really tight dialing that stuff in where you can get like a pack, um, that just sits nice and snug on you.

Speaker 2:          00:40:33       And you can put what like I use, I use a brand called Nathan and they have like ones have bladders on the back where they also have ones that you can put water bottles on the front. Um, and then just, you know, different setups and stuff. So, so yeah, that's like a must in, I mean, he, even in early mornings, it's got to be brutal in Phoenix. Right? Yeah. Uh, I mean I have yet to see the worst of it. Why did you move there? Uh, well, part of it was, um, I want to carry a gun. Well, I'm looking at, well, I moved from Sacramento, so let's say I'm looking into that now.

Speaker 2:          00:41:07       But yeah, so it's, um, it was, it was a combination of things for me. Like, uh, I'm trying to kind of balance a few different things. I, I train a lot. I also work for one of my primary sponsors, ultra footwear, uh, and like for me to be able to kind of do this stuff for them that I was wanting to do, it made more sense to be in Phoenix, just be product testing and stuff like that. Yeah. That, and just like putting on like, like small group runs and events and things like that in the area. Uh, like if I wanted to invest or if I wanted to kind of appropriately handled the territory, phoenix made a lot more sense in sacramento. Northern California has just grown so much for that company in the last couple of years that they needed to get someone in there who's going to do full time plus to really cover the area.

Speaker 2:          00:41:49       Um, and then I, you know, I also got engaged in, in January as well. So, uh, um, my fiance, she, she was best served being in the Phoenix area too, so it was kind of a mutual, uh, she was from Dallas originally and Phoenix was kind of like a, a mutually good spot for both of us. So, uh, um, we, we both kind of looked at it as like, well, what do we want? And it was, we want trails right in our backyard, but we also want access to flat stuff. And we, we actually kind of want the heat because it like, there's races where you need that to train for. So when it gets hot earlier, you can prepare for them. A much easy reason to move to Phoenix. I'm enjoying the heat for training. Well, I'm not even the craziest one in the house.

Speaker 2:          00:42:34       My, my fiance's a savage. She, yeah, her name is Nicole Calla dropless. She like, you know how like, I thought, I've always thought I'm a hard worker and someone who like puts a lot of time and effort and the things I do. And then I met her and, uh, you know, I like took, she's, she's cut from the Jackal cloth, let's put it that way. Right. So, yeah, she'll do like, she, she works for a company called Towers Watson. Um, and uh, Kinda does a, manages the Midwest division for like stuffs. So she'll be on like a conference call with Amazon and then, you know, go out and run three hours after that and then come back and get on another conference call and just keeps going and going and going. So, yeah, it's, uh, it, it was, it made sense for her job and my job to kind of be in Phoenix and with as busy as she is and as busy as I can get from time to time, like it's nice to be able to go out your backyard and be on the trail five minutes later.

Speaker 2:          00:43:26       Whereas both of us didn't have that before. We both had to drive to get to any kind of trail, especially her dallas. It was a lot of, it's just like flat road running in her area. So um, to helps us him hardly any hills. No, no, you will. And that's, that's, that's what is impressive with like, so she's done western states a few times. The race, I was telling him before the canyons and I, she's been sixth place there twice, just training on flat roads, basically. Crazy. Does she do anything to augment that? Like doing lunges or anything like that? Uh, she does, uh, some strength work and stuff, but really in a lot of it was just, you know, she would go out and run and run a lot and then I'm sure like she hasn't met her full potential at that specific event or certainly like mountain type races just because she wasn't trained in mountains.

Speaker 2:          00:44:10       Right, right. Yeah. And she's, she's good though. So like, I mean, she was a division one recruit for college and stuff back in the day. So like, and she's got some rung talent, no doubt. Um, and then she puts in the work is consistency is a huge thing. Like if you can't find the specific stuff and you're really geeked about a specific race, like I don't think not having the right training environment as a reason to not do it if you're excited to do it. Um, so like for her, she was more excited to get out on the trails and she wants to go, you know, do something on a track or a flat road. Like I was, so for her it was like, even if I'm not quite where I would like to be, I'm going to do it anyway. Now I'm not familiar with ultra footwear, but what I wanted to ask you is, does anybody wear like minimalist shoes and run these ultra marathons?

Speaker 2:          00:44:53       Yeah, yeah. There was, uh, there was actually a Gal, I cannot remember her name, this is a couple of years ago who ran ultras in um, those vibram fivefingers yeah, yeah. And a trail stuff too. So, um, you know, it must have been a beast. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, hard to run just a couple miles. Yeah. And it's, you know, it's interesting because so ultra footwear made the shoe this last year called uh, the, the vanish and it's essentially a minimalist shoe. I'm just like a little bit of fabric on the top. Super, super hard flat base. And that's kind of what I like when I'm on a road or a track. Um, so I was wearing that, the vanish vanish. Yeah. Pull that up and see what that looks like. And it's a, so I went to this, this, this ultra race, and I wore those thinking I'm going to have the lightest shoe out of anyone here.

Speaker 2:          00:45:40       Three guys show up running completely barefoot. Why? He ran an ultra marathons barefoot. Yeah, he had to, that's another level. There was one, there was one guy who is Christ. He's like a to 22 or 23 marathoner and he's barefoot. And he said that he like runs a marathon bear, so he doesn't do the marathon barefoot. He actually said that, uh, the, that's a little bit of padding in that it looks like we're less, there's a lip on the outside. Is that the vantage or is that it's his vantage point. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So I mean there's, there's a little bit, there's like a, it like a carbon fiber plate and you see where that little cut is in there. There's like a carbon fiber plate in there that makes it a little more firm. So when I'm looking for in a shoe and I'm looking for kind of like that natural feel is something that's got to affirm its soul or affirm durometer because like I don't want to squish down into the shoe.

Speaker 2:          00:46:27       I want to pop right off the ground. Um, and I think like really like that is just, I mean you've probably experienced this with the, with the vibrams where like, um, if you spend the time, your foot feet gets stronger and stronger and stronger and it's only a matter of time before they get strong. If you've got to keep kind of working at it, just like a weight lifter, you know, when they start out weightlifting, they're nowhere near where they are 10 years later. Um, so like for me, back in 2012 I think I kind of like, you know, I read born to run and I've even heard of the book. Yeah, I've heard some amazing, yeah. You know, I, I read that and I was like, this is intriguing, you know, and it made a lot of sense too. It's like, you know, if we were meant to have a wedge on our heel, like we would have had a wedge on our heel.

Speaker 2:          00:47:12       Yeah. No that's, that's a ridiculous thing that Nike came up with. And it's really unfortunate that so many people have adopted that and they've run, he'll first like that. Yeah. Well and the problem I think too is that like the shoe is essentially a cast for your foot. Even even that vanish that I had up there, a little cast compared to what you're normally going to see, but it's still a cast. That's why I liked those five fingers cause there's nothing, this is a very, very flexible, Robbie's a rubber underneath and it's a glove for your, for your feet. Yeah. Yeah. And you know, people just don't know that. I think that you can really work those foot muscles to a point where you can exhaust them the way you would in a shoe. Um, it just takes a lot of time cause like if I broke my arm, put a cast on it and then like six, eight weeks later got the cast taken off, I went back in the weight room and did a normal routine, I would be wrecked the next day.

Speaker 2:          00:48:02       So when you take your foot out of that shoe cast, you have it in or take it out of the position it's gotten used to and put it in a different position, it's like taking a cast off and trying to do that full mode of mode of a training or motion. So like you know, I when I first kind of got an ultra running, I, I I worked my way down to a minimal issue. I spent probably six months before I was running exclusively and something that was um, really minimalist. And when I say minimalist, I mean zero drop and no cushion or little to no cushion. Cause I think some people confuse that too. Like that the shoe you saw up there cause was like, oh it looks like it's got a little bit of padding there. So that's like zero drop with cushioning or that she really doesn't have a lot of cushioning, but, um, there are shoes that ultra makes.

Speaker 2:          00:48:46       It does. And what that does is it takes you from, like the way I describe is this is someone in like a, um, someone in a traditional running shoe, real built up cushion. A lot of support is on one in a spectrum barefoot runner. Like those dudes that I ran into at the track, um, they're on the other end of the spectrum. There's all the steps in between to get to that. So like, I can't believe people run ultras barefoot. Yeah. It's crazy. I don't think there's too many periods this fucking savage. I look at this dude barefoot. Ted. Ted. Ted. The Sandal. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:49:19       Is it a sandal? Yeah. Hmm. Well that it wasn't that in the born to one that these guys had made sandals out of tires. Yeah. Uh Huh. Yeah. I've been using something called a pull up, this Vivo Vivo Barefoot. I've been using these. Um, what I like about these is that I don't have to look where I step. There's no cushioning at all. The trail one, I'll use that one. The far left, the far left. Yeah, that run. Um, there's no cushion to it, but it's got some tread and the bottom is hard enough so that I could run on hard rocks and then I don't think about it. It's hard to tell in that image how little there is underneath it. But there's a, there's nothing going on in terms of like there's no squished to it at all to just some good size knobs. So you have, uh, some good, um, some good tread, you know, so you can, you know, you can get good traction and dirt and mud and stuff like that. They weighed nothing

Speaker 2:          00:50:15       that's, yeah. And you know, it's normal that thing up to your foot muscles are flexing every which way they,

Speaker 1:          00:50:19       yeah. That's cool. It's made a big difference with me, man. But honestly to five fingers are probably the best for that. They just don't have as much traction and I have to look where I'm stepping, you know, like I have to be careful like sharp rocks and stuff. I have to look down. Don't step on that one. I'll look around. I don't like looking it just run with those. I can just run. Just flow through it. Yeah, you can get a faster pace with those

Speaker 2:          00:50:42       [inaudible]. Yeah, and that's, that's, that's where I kind of draw the line too is like when I'm on the roads and on the track, I don't mind having that like no cushion type of thing. But then when I go on like the trails and Phoenix, it's very rocky and hard and then I'll use like a shoe called the king empty. That's kind of like the one that you had there. It's a little less nimble I would say. Then that one, but it's got that, that like really aggressive lug. It's got the foot shape, toe box, so I don't feel like my feet are getting pinch together. What do you think barefoot Ted does on like on the trails? I was trails. I think he probably wears those sandals probably,

Speaker 1:          00:51:13       right? Yeah. Just something where it's just something that keeps him forgetting.

Speaker 2:          00:51:17       Cut. Yeah. But there are guys who just do that barefoot to fuck. I think they're very few, but it's, it's, it's doable.

Speaker 1:          00:51:24       Have you ever see that show dual survivor? It's one of those wacky survivor shows. I don't know if I've seen that one. This one guy, I think his name's corey, who has the most disgusting fee I've ever seen in my life. Almost as disgusting as that one guy was cutting the bottom of feet off and feeding into dog. That guy with the knife. Yeah. That video's awful to watch. But a, this guy walks barefoot everywhere and his idea is like, do you gotta toughen your feet up? Because you might not have to have shoes. You know, they, they get real crazy with this whole survival, this then, so this guy is basically has, I'm not joking, like a good solid half inch of callous under his entire foot. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:52:02       It's amazing what the human body will do when you put it in a position to need to. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:52:07       Well it has to adapt. I mean, that's one of the reasons why I'm fascinated by guys like you, these ultra runners is because the, for the average person, that's an impossible feat. But you've built, there's that guy's foot. Look at that dude. What ends up fuck it looks like elephant skin. Yeah, it's fucking gnarly. Um, but the guys like you have adapted your body to this position where, you know, you can do that and it's just a matter of putting in the training runs and making sure you're fueling up correctly. And, you know, a hundred mile race is not a question whether or not you could do it. It's how fast he could do it.

Speaker 2:          00:52:41       Yeah. You know, it's, it's interesting, the cool thing in this, Michael, back to what you asked, like why ultra marathons, and I think it is part of it too is like in a hundred miles, it's almost like it's not a matter of when is something going to go wrong. It's, um, or I should say, if something's gonna go wrong, it's a matter of when and how do you respond to it. So it's a typical thing that goes wrong. Um, you know, I think a lot of people will have like cramping or they'll, they'll bonk, I mean this is one of the reasons why I love the high fat approach is because like bonking from the light energy side of things is essentially nonexistent explained bunkie too. People don't know where you talk. So, so bonking is essentially what happens and it's, it's, I think it's actually more common in the marathon just because people are running a lot faster in those.

Speaker 2:          00:53:24       But essentially what's is you're depleting your glycogen stores to the point where your body doesn't really have access to that fuel substrate anymore. And if you are trying, if you're not good at metabolizing fat or you cannot burn fat at a high rate, at a decent clip, a grinds to a halt and you see people staggering and falling over, losing her mind, hallucinating and stuff like that in those situations. Um, so like, you know, banking is something that is, is an issue with ultra marathon because you're out there for so long. If you get behind on fueling, you know, you could bonk and stuff like that. So, you know, part of the reason, and I talked about before with like, there's a lot of logistics with an ultra marathon and there's all these variables are just, just, just so prevalent when you're out there that long that if you can eliminate some of those are reduced, the potential then flaring up, that's usually a wind cause then there's less chance of something popping up that you wouldn't expect or an uncertain thing happening during the race. And, but they still happen. You know, I've done the, I would say the most efficient hundred miler I've done is, uh, when I, I ran 11 hours and 40 minutes and 55 seconds at a race in 2015 called Holy Shit.

Speaker 3:          00:54:28       You bet you ran a hundred miles in 11 hours. Yeah, that was, that was on a trip. That was one on the track in a Spec of a fuck. That's crazy. Ran a 11 hours. You were at a hundred miles. Yeah. So I think the thing that, how long does it take to drive a hundred miles? Okay. It takes it. I mean, if you go a hundred miles an hour, it takes an hour to me longer to get to the airport. If the traffic on the five how's that bitter? Broke the US 100 mile record. You average seven fucking minutes per mile for almost 12 hours. Dude, that is insane. That is fucking insane. Bert Kreischer, he brags when he runs 70 minute files for like three miles. What did, what did burdened up running that? The La Marathon in six and a half. Six and a half. I think it was close to that. Yeah, it's going to shorter than that. I think it was five, five or something. Yeah. No, no, no. Ours. Dad. Yeah, he's fucking JV. Well, I'll say, I'll say, I'll say this here, bird, if you're listening, contact me. I'll get you to four and a half in six months. You're challenge is Zach fucking man. If he tells you you can do it, that is, that is an incredible number that you broke the u s 100 mile record by running seven fucking minutes per mile. It's, it's, that's crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:55:54       The thing. And the interesting thing I thought about that event was when I was talking about efficiency is I stopped twice during that race and it was for maybe a total of like 60 at most 90 seconds total. And it was just, it was just a p two times. Do you have a thought about just pee in your pants and just keep running? Well, black shorts party rolling. There was a guy who did that. Uh, it was two years before I did that race and he was trying to break 13 hours and he was like right on the edge. I mean, he just whipped it out and peed

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       all over the track, I'm pretty sure. Okay. What would he put his penis on? Pants. I don't know. Yeah, I mean, I think that's probably what I would do. And um, it's uh, uh, that guy dude, he did himself well. Everyone who's been doing endurance sport long enough, we'll have, have a situation like that unfortunately. Got Him of his legs. He must've just exploded last. It must have been a bomb bomb went off. Oof. Yeah. It's, you know, it's, it's okay to poop your pants does a sign, is that him with the same guy? Different person. It's very a sensitive subject for folks. Yeah. Your parents. Yeah. It's, it's a, it's a running joke in the endurance running community though. Cause if you do it long enough to spend, probably happen to eventually passed it. Right. And I would imagine you're running a hundred miles and your body's gonna.

Speaker 3:          00:57:08       There's gonna be misfires for sure. How do you time your meals? Like before you run it, like say if you're going to run a hundred miles, what is your last meal before you get there? Yeah, so I'll eat a big dinner the night before, probably around like four or five o'clock. And what would that be? Um, so I'll do like a huge steak. Uh, I try to keep 16 ounces, 20 ounces at least 1620 is probably a pretty good number. 140 pounds give or take a lot of fucking meat. That's crazy. Well, this is where it gets fascinating with the lifestyle thing I was telling you about is like there's days during the year where like I'm in training where I'm metabolizing two to three times my resting metabolic rate. So I've got to feed myself appropriately for that. Um, and that means a lot of stake. Wow.

Speaker 3:          00:57:54       So was that your primary food source? Um, I don't know if I'd say stake for sure, but definitely fatty meat sources. Um, a lot of like, uh, like saturated fat based oils like coconut oil, like Geeky, that sort of thing. Um, but yeah, I don't, I don't shy away from meat. I usually have meat or eggs for every meal for the most part. And interesting in every meal I should say. Yeah. There's a lot of talk lately about the Carnivore Diet. There's a lot of people that are delving into that, including Jordan Peterson's daughter, which is a really interesting case because she had severe autoimmune disorder. Like she had some severe issues with like horrible arthritis where she's had, um, I know she's had hip replacements and that believe she's having an ankle replaced soon too. Okay. Like, she's like severe issues and if she eats anything other than me, it flares up horribly.

Speaker 3:          00:58:50       It's really crazy. I've never, I'm not going to, I want to try to talk to her, maybe even get her in here. But, um, I, I've never heard anything like that. I thought I heard somewhere. Um, it was after the last time you had Jordan on where he was telling you about how he just basically he meets in Greens. Where was on his daughter's recommendation? Yeah, I think he's cut out all vegetables right now for at least a trial. I thought I saw something about that. Um, but yeah, it's, it's one of those things where I think like some, it's like what I was saying before, like why I don't necessarily want people to say like, well Zach is saying everyone should do exactly what he's doing

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       and then, you know, they, that's important to bring up. Everybody's body is different for sure. I mean to the point where like you have people like that, like when I had issues I were having were incredibly minor compared to the Jordan Peterson's daughter. Like, like, I mean, she's in a spot where, you know, she had to make changes if she wanted to even just probably do daily activities. Um, and you know, that's that, that's I think the hard part for people to kind of understand is like, there people are at different stages of that. Some people, like no one's breaking themselves overnight. So it's like this is something that's chipping away at people and sometimes it chips away at them quicker and some people and it takes longer for others. Uh, so if you have an issue like that, it's like you almost have to go back to square one and say, what are, give me a couple things that I know aren't going to upset me. And let's start from there and see if we can start adding things back eventually. Maybe. Or, um, you know, we, uh, you know Sean Baker you had on the podcast, we actually started recording some podcasts together and um, we are having this gal come on who's been a carnival for eight years and she was kind of in that situation where she had a whole bunch of goofy things going on even with the Quito Protocol and she eventually just cut everything up with meat and has been doing great ever since.

Speaker 1:          01:00:36       That's a vegans nightmare and things like that. Like, well, yeah, I just wish people could separate their ideology from the reality of certain people's bodies. And, and unfortunately, and this is very, unfortunately, you've got a separate, also all your, all the horrors that we associate with factory farming and all the other things that we associate with meat and meat consumption, those things are real and terrible and he absolutely should be avoided in absolutely factory farmers should be illegal. I mean, I think it's one of the great horrors of modern society. I really, really do. But take that away. And you know, some people don't think animals should die at all, but they don't live forever. And other animals eat them and it's just like this is just a part of life. Then you're into health and whether or not consuming meat is actually healthy and there's no evidence that it's not, there's none.

Speaker 2:          01:01:27       Yeah. You know the thing that like I want a Vegan to sit me down and explained to me is that like when I look at bioavailability, um, of micro nutrients, it's like you can't find much better than liver. Like it's like the stuff is super available.

Speaker 1:          01:01:46       Quite Alpha wolves immediately go to the river when they kill something.

Speaker 2:          01:01:50       Yeah. So like it and it, so like it's like I need that. Like, I don't know. I'm sure there's ranges of what people can do in terms of absorbing something like, like a non heme iron versus a heme iron. But like for me it's, it's like if my iron levels below low, the first thing I'm going to, I'm doubling down on liver, doubling down on liver and it's like far as nutrients.

Speaker 1:          01:02:12       Just talking about, just from a purely objective standpoint, the consumption of nutrients, organ meats are some of the best for sure. You're aware of Chris Kresser? Yep. Chris was a macrobiotic Vegan and you know, I mean he was like fully hardcore and this was having all sorts of huge issues. His body just didn't react to it and he fixed all that by eating organ meat. And that's like his primary food source.

Speaker 3:          01:02:35       Yeah. Um, what's the Gal's name? There's a lady who she can't remember what she had. Uh, I'm, I'm not going to think of it, but if I do, I'll remember. But she did pretty much the same thing.

Speaker 1:          01:02:47       But some people are fine with the Vegan diet too. That's the other thing that's important to point out. It might not be the best for them in terms of like bioavailability, bioavailability of nutrients, but it's certainly better than standard western diet.

Speaker 3:          01:03:00       Sure. American diet, but for some people they can get by with it and not have any issues. Well, some people get away with even more. I mean Courtney to Walter Candy, right? Like it's candy and drinks beer, Eatsa Nachos. We took it to a Bagel place. She fucking chow down hills and cream cheese. She's a fucking animal man. I read an article about her not too long ago and she said that she's got like candy jar sitting around the house and she's like, before I go for a run, I'll go anywhere from just like, you know, nibbling on it to a small stomach ache. So we're not operating from the same field I guess.

Speaker 1:          01:03:32       And that she's a real freak man, you know, there's people that know her that just, they're stunned by her because what's interesting about her is she's not a fast runner in per say, like, like the way she would run a marathon. She'd run a marathon and like three hours. So did she, did she talk about how she got into running when she was out here? I believe she did. Do you remember her specifically, Jamie? Sort of like you, she ran in high school I think a little bit, but was she was teaching as well. Okay. Yeah. While she was teaching, she was running and doing these things and then eventually she was able to get enough sponsors so that she could run full time, which is what she does now. But with with her, I think, and this is one of the reasons why I'm fascinated by you folks with her, it's her mind.

Speaker 1:          01:04:15       Her mind is just unbelievably powerful. When she was experiencing cornea, a deimos might hurt. She couldn't fucking see man. She was literally blind that she barely could see her feet and she still won. She fell, cracked her head open, blood's pouring down her head and she's still one. Was it, was that at run rabbit run? I don't think that was what it was. Yeah, I think that's what it was. And there's an image of her crossing the finish line. Literally can't see shit. She's got her hands in front of her. She's covered in blood like she's up fucking savage. She's, she's,

Speaker 3:          01:04:46       she's a, if you take the, then just think about ultra marathons is like, we kind of, we're small enough sport where it's like you can't really say like, Oh, I'm a hundred miler. It's like, okay, you everybody, wait. No. Well it's like, yeah, I know. So like you have everything from a 50 kilometer that's got over 10,000 feet of climbing and descending to a six day event on a track and they're all the same sport. When you look at like people who can kind of do really well at all of them or in Courtney's case really well at all of them, you can't find a better female on the female side of things. Someone who can do it better than that like she does. She goes, it goes on the track,

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       kills it. She goes and 240 miles through the mountains. Kills it. It's crazy.

Speaker 1:          01:05:23       Yeah. She's something on really, really unusual. You know, a buddy of mine, my friend Brian, it was texting me about her while she was getting, Brian is, he doesn't even run, I don't think are barely, I mean it's not a, but he was just so fascinated by this one woman that was so far ahead of everybody was like, what the fuck is she doing? Then she beat the second place guy by 10 hours in a 238 mile race, 22 miles. She was ahead of him. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:05:49       That's an interesting topic to where like the, where like men and women in an ultra marathon and how that kind of like where it's one of the rare races where women can win. And it's the, the interesting thing to me about it is women can and do win some races, but when they're like, like Courtney's very much the most, I would say, talented person to do one of the 200 milers. Yet, like there hasn't been a lot of what like the, the top of the sport hasn't really moved into that. I mean, courtney certainly is top of the sport, but she's, I think she's the best. I think she's the best woman all around. Right? If certainly in the United States thinks she's the best at running those 200 milers, uh,

Speaker 1:          01:06:29       is it dependent upon altitude gain and loss and

Speaker 2:          01:06:32       bleed and it, and just variables to the day? I think like, so like, I mean, there's, there's some real, like there's a guy named Kilian journey, um, and he spells his name, j. O. R, n, e t and uh, he won the, um, or he, he's, he's, he's essentially the best mountain runner by far. Like there's maybe one of the guy who could maybe compete with him at something under a hundred miles, but if it's like he's, he's, he would probably like beat everyone by who knows how much in a 200 we've seen one of these videos before. Yeah. He'll, he'll run on these, he'll run on these like ridge lines and like, it'll be the death on both sides and he just

Speaker 1:          01:07:12       play these fucking guys, man. Oh, I have cms. This isn't even nearly as Shane. Oh, Mike. Yeah, that's, that's crazy. Look at him. It looks like a freak to the gopro strapped to his heaven. That's gotta throw your balance off. He's running with a Gopro. Put that down intention. That was my son. I'd be like, pay attention where you're running kid Jesus.

Speaker 2:          01:07:36       Yeah, he's interesting because I mean, his parents were like mountaineers I think, and like, so he was like basically playing in the mountains at like age three and basically grew up doing this stuff. So yeah. So he's the, he's the type of guy who like, he's, he's probably the best in the sport right now. And it's

Speaker 1:          01:07:50       my guys jumping around. He's an asshole. He's an asshole. He's, he is running folks. What is this a video? Instagram. I don't really know. Okay. [inaudible] spell his name. Kay. I is that two l's, one l one l. I. A n. J. O. R. N. E. T. And he's running in [inaudible]. How do you say that? Chamonix chaminade. Chamonix France. And he's running one on what looks

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       like the fin of a shark. If a shark was the size of a mountain, this guy's a fucking animal, man. That is so scary. Oh, I get sweaty. My hands are sweating just watching it. And so he is the best on the mountains for sure. He doesn't do anything that's not mountain. It's like he did western states and one in 2011 and he was complaining about it being too flat. Oh Jesus Christ. What is the gain and loss of elevation in Western net downhill? So it's 2100 25,000 feet down. 17,000 feet up. What? So he's complaining about that. Yeah. It's too flat. 17,000 feet up and it gets much crazier. And that you can do, you can do like 50 miles or 100 k's that have the same profile as that. So you can get, like, if you're doing like what he's doing, that probably does feel kind of flat for him.

Speaker 2:          01:09:06       Like he likes that steep technical stuff. So, but yeah, so as far as the mountains go, he's, he's the guy to beat for sure. And he'll do races on a regular basis when he is running because he's actually a professional skier too. So like he's only running basically half of the year and he's skiing. The other half is Christ. Yeah. Yeah. So He's, he's a fun dude to follow for sure. Um, but yeah, it's a w when you look at like some of the races that are kind of the big races, like Western states, 100 is the most competitive hundred miler in the United States and ultra trail Mont Blanc, which is actually by chaminade where you saw that video, um, is probably at least a last year was the most competitive in the world. Um, those are the reasons I like to look at to kind of see like where the divergences from the males and the females.

Speaker 2:          01:09:49       Uh, and if you look at like course records and winning times, like, you know, the men are finishing like two plus hours ahead of the women are on a pretty regular basis on that type of stuff. And um, at ultra trail mount blonde, you know, sometimes it's four or five hours, uh, and then it, so then you can kind of lay, it actually kind of is more in line with what you see with other endurance distances like marathons and stuff like that. Uh, the crazy thing about it though is, uh, that doesn't mean that's going to happen every time. Like there's certainly years where women do really well and finish like in the top 10 amongst the in like look western states or utm be, um, one year in 2006, uh, this gal and Nikki Kimball, uh, she finished third overall at Western states was, which is the highest finish finishing finishing place for a woman other than this other lady named Anne Treyson who she hasn't really race anymore, but she was, she's kind of like the legend of the sport from the women, uh, where she's, she's uh, um, one western states like 14 times and had like 20 world records at one point and stuff like that.

Speaker 2:          01:10:51       And um, but Nikki, Nikki Kimball, she finished third and part of it was, cause that was like the hottest year in the canyons on record. And if women do, one thing I'm pretty confident women do better at these hundred miles in men is they're not nearly as stupid. Like the man will go out. And like, if it's competitive, it takes one or two guys to kind of run a little too fast and he's gonna bring five, six, seven guys with them. And then it's actually a fascinating racing concept, I think, because then it's like if you're watching it, you're like, okay, one of these guys didn't have the race of his life and hold on for dear life and run a spectacular time. Everyone else is going to blow up. Apically when's it going to happen? So you can thin out that men's field really easily when that happens. I think the women are a little smarter than that.

Speaker 2:          01:11:35       They catch them off. Right. Wasn't, wasn't there a guy that was like way out ahead, uh, that, that might've been the case. Yeah, he dropped off. Yeah. Keep it up. He was probably running way too fast for what he was capable of doing. And then you see that all the time and it's really easy to do at 100 plus miles because really at the end of the day, like if you feel comfortable at the start, you'll probably going to fast now. How do you pace yourself and something like that. Like what do you, are you using your watch? Are you counting steps? Like what are you doing? Yeah. Um, I like to get to a point where I can use perceived effort, which is basically like listening to my body and I can know like okay this is a little too hard, I need to dial it back.

Speaker 2:          01:12:12       Um, I'll use heart rate a lot in training to kind of get myself to the fitness I'm looking for. Your rich roll was talking about that he was saying that he tries to stay under one 40 or in the one 49 inch. Yeah. And the thing about heart rate that I, where I kind of deviate from heart rate is when you start getting into these really long events that go past like two or three hours, heart rate starts losing its value in terms of being able to trust it as like a metric that's going to tell you to do the right thing. Like there's so many things that can kind of disrupt that from like dehydration to just cardiac drift, all kinds of, all kinds of things. So I think like if an athlete really has things dialed in that can use heart rate and training and they can look at heart rate if they want, but they also need to connect that with perceived effort so that if something goes wrong with that or it starts, you know, issues start coming up with the heart rate side of things, they can still kind of like reflect back in on themselves.

Speaker 2:          01:13:02       Like, okay, this is a state sustainable pace for me. Or this is not a sustainable pace for me. Rich Roll, we should point out is a Vegan. Yeah. And you know, he's one of the few guys that is fully functional. It has no issues at all keeping that diet up. Yeah. Yeah. And I think he, I mean, he puts a lot of work into that, I think. Oh, you have to. Yeah. I mean, you really have to be just super dedicated to making sure you're getting the proper amount of nutrients and making sure you get in microbiology and all these different forms of b12 and yeah. Yeah. And then whenever someone comes to me and says like, I'm a Vegan, I'm a vegetarian or something like that, it's like, who should I look to? And he's the, he's the first guy I point to is like if there's someone doing it right, it's him.

Speaker 2:          01:13:38       So now he's definitely doing it right now. When it comes to something like Moab to 40, how does someone like courtney below that whole field, the way like that? Um, I think some of it is just, that's a really new event. Like I think they're in their like third or fourth year for two hundreds. There's three of them in the United States and they'll probably be four or five in the next couple of years. So it really hasn't, it's in its infancy. I mean, think of it like, uh, like with UFC, like back lake in the 90s, like, and then where does that today? So like those two hundreds or kind of like UFC was in the 90s. And I mean, if that becomes a thing, if people start gravitating toward it, then you're start, you'll see some of these course records just get blown out. I mean we saw that with the hundred mile distance and you've seen that with, you know, a lot of all the trail course records.

Speaker 2:          01:14:24       Um, because like a lot of fast guys and gals have moved into the sport and the last five, 10 years. So we've just been, it's been like just deeper talent pool, more likely to get a complete genetic freak more likely. And the other thing too is like, um, a lot, like a lot of times what you have is you get competitive enough in a sport then, um, people start playing with fire and training and they're doing it because they know they have to get to their optimal best. And sometimes they overtrain overtrained get hurt and, and then, but then the people that make it through that are there as fit as they can get. So then you can see, you can see some really good times. Do you peak for a race? Yeah, definitely. Same way a fighter would peak for a fight. Yup. I'll usually pick two, maybe three races a year and those are the ones that I'm really going to try to nail. Those are the ones where like I'm gonna like try to do everything I can to be ready to hurt during that race. And then I'll usually do, maybe it's usually ranged, like I'll usually do about six to eight ultra marathons in a year. And then the other ones are kind of like those training races that I talked about before or every once in a while I'll get invited to a race that's like overseas and it's like a free trip to go to China or something like that. We'll speak in birding

Speaker 1:          01:15:37       during a race. I know that a lot of ultra runners are utilizing cbd and even using edible marijuana while they run and that they found that this is a great performance enhancing.

Speaker 2:          01:15:52       Yeah. Yeah. I don't know if you ever messed around with CBD or, Yeah. Not, not within workouts though, like more as like a sleep aid or anything but like, or an inflammation thing. So it's like more of a post war. There was an esquire article,

Speaker 1:          01:16:07       Cole or Maxim, one of them guy, guy magazine type things, and it was all about, uh, marijuana and ultra running and that it's, it's somehow or another, uh, become a big part of it that for a lot of these guys,

Speaker 2:          01:16:21       yeah. I think find a champion. I, you know, it's interesting because like, you know, marijuana use, I'm not sure about cbd, but marijuana use is like, is illegal in competition. Yeah. It's like all of them. Uh, yeah, it's, it's, so there's like a Usada type standard. It's the same, it's the Usada Protocol. So I think, I think it's like, it has to be below a certain level for like, that's great. Then, so they, they're testing you for epo and all those things. I mean, it's still pretty primitive and ultra running, um, like there's testing at some of the big races, uh, and that's even relatively new, like in the last year or so. So like Western states, they'll test, they'll test a, the top 10 on each side and then a few random people. And then, uh, I think ut and B, which is the other big hundred miler I was talking about, they tasks.

Speaker 2:          01:17:05       Like I was tested after when I broke the $12 world record in 2013. I got tested after that. Um, have there been any big superstars that pissed hot? Um, there's been people who have, uh, they weren't like individuals that were like kind of like a poster child of the sport necessarily though. Lamps, Lance Armstrong, nothing, nothing like that. So, um, and it's, it's really interesting because like, I mean there's certainly people skirting the rules and ultra marathon running. Um, I have no doubt about it, but I think they're doing, uh, probably like, what is it? Uh, I dealt, they're doing like blood transfusion, things like Tour de France talk. Cause I mean that's an expensive hard thing to kind of put together. You need a doctor essentially, if I'm understanding it. All right. So they're probably just doing little like minor things, like maybe like peptides or something like that would be my guess.

Speaker 2:          01:17:57       But I also do think it's not nearly like people, I think nowadays it would like with Icarus and all that stuff, like now people are on the opposite side of what they were a few years ago where they, they suspect everyone's doing it versus I know they're not doing it. They haven't gotten caught yet, which is where we were probably a few years ago. Um, in ultra running. I think, I think the culture plays a huge role in that. I mean like when you had lance on and they get, he was pretty good about talking about like how like, you know, like you come into the sport, you go over to Europe to race and like they asked you to get on a protocol. If you say no, they send you back. Like it's like that's a cultural thing then to like let it gets like you, you have to do it to be in this sport almost in with ultra running. I just kind of the opposite. I think. Um, I think the culture is stay away from that stuff. Like, like we don't, we don't want that

Speaker 1:          01:18:45       because it's a mind thing almost more than anything, which is why people like courtney who aren't maybe the fastest marathon runners but have this just bulletproof mind that allows them to compete and that you really, there's no supplement for your mind for willpower.

Speaker 2:          01:19:01       Yeah. Yeah. And there's things that can go wrong just from the duration you're out there.

Speaker 1:          01:19:06       Yeah, I can imagine. I mean it seems to be so much of it seems to be your ability to deal with discomfort and pain and just press on.

Speaker 2:          01:19:14       Yeah. It, you know, the way I describe ultra marathon running is it's still a running sport.

Speaker 1:          01:19:18       See runner's high. The athletes use marijuana to improve their training. What was that in? Was it in the Guardian? I taught both of those and yet, but guardian stone, marathon runners may seem like walking contradictions, but there are hints that the drug and long distance running could go hand in hand. I'll tell you what, man, I've only done it a few times where I got super baked and went running. It feels awesome. It feels great to feel so scared though. Like, ah, what am I doing? But I would imagine for some people it's a, you know, euphoric, 50% of the runners are meaner, avid cannabis user to say almost none of them are open about it says avery.

Speaker 2:          01:19:56       Oh yeah, yeah. Avery Collins is, he's interesting because he's, he's a spokesperson for marijuana use and you know, like, I mean, I don't, you don't have to look far into like marijuana and how it got to be where it is in terms of its legality or illegality to recognize there are some tomfoolery going on there. Like, I mean, you don't have to be like a historian to find out like, like why that's criminalized world, whereas alcohol isn't, and that sort of sorta thing. And Avery's been like a pretty big proponent about kind of, uh, de stigmatizing it. Um, and, but you know, he understands, at least he understands that it's illegal and competition. And I think he's been tested at least twice after races. I mean, he was six that western states last year. So he had gotten tested for that. And Caffeine, illegal and competition? No. Um, I think at a certain level, I think it is, although they may have just removed it, I'm trying to remember if I saw that right. But it used to be like you can have caffeine but at a certain level it would be illegal but it was like the equivalent of like 16 cups of coffee or something like that. So you'd have to put down like four of those Nitros

Speaker 3:          01:21:05       nitros right before your race if you wanted any, any chance of going over that. And you probably go into cardiac arrest before anyway and by the time you got to the end of the race he would probably be out of your system anyway. Well, it's interesting, I actually, this is

Speaker 2:          01:21:17       diverging a little bit, but I, I read a story a while ago that there was some high school kid who was playing football and he like slammed a red bull or some one of those like high caffeine energy drinks and then like was like on the kick return team or something returned to kick for touchdown, was just jacked out of his mind, slammed another one and then went back on the field and had a heart

Speaker 3:          01:21:37       tack or something like, I'm sure it could happen is you go too hard. It's not just caffeine. Right. A lot of those things have a bunch of other worlds. Once it, I'm too, you remember red lines? Oh yeah. I took one of those ones. I drank the whole bottle and then I looked at it, it says like four servings. I'm like, Oh shit. Well servings like 150 milligrams of caffeine or something. Nuts. Yeah. Well, and then they put a bunch of other stimulants in there that people don't know about, so yeah. Tarin and all sorts of other shit in there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The kind of those pre workout supplements were kind of wild. Yeah. Oh, remember those a ripped fuel. I took rip fuel once and went to a Jujitsu class. I had to stop. I had to stop training. I'm like, I'm, I'm, my heart is beating so fast.

Speaker 3:          01:22:18       I could die here. Like this is, this is not good. And that was right before they pulled it off the market. Cut It in just in time. I guess it was the other thing they pulled off the market too, that was killing people. Was it called Jack Three D. Oh, okay. I think I remember hearing them. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They, that killed a few folks. I think it killed a few folks in the military. So you know, you're not talking about like some fucking sickly old man's like, I don't know, have to get a truck. It's like fucking soldiers. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I'll use caffeine in races. I think it's pretty clear that caffeine is a performance enhancing and it just happens to be one that's equally, that's legal and some mild performance enhancing and using coffee or taking pills

Speaker 2:          01:22:56       a little. I've done a variety of different things. Um, in I've done, uh, I did a race once where I was trying to figure out like my fueling rate and like kind of what was ideal, and this was a while ago, but I did 100 k race and I did nothing but mountain dew and it was like, wow. I think I took in, it ended up coming out to about 158 calories an hour of just mountain dew with some luck. I added some electro lights too. I feel like if you, if you're just sitting around doing nothing, mountain dews probably terrible for you for sure. If you're running hills and really kicking ass like that, the amount of fuel you're burning. Yeah, mountain dew might be a great move if you don't go overboard. I mean, so does that every aid station at pretty much every race?

Speaker 2:          01:23:40       Yeah. So it's definitely something people have identified as useful. But like since then I've been a, that product was talking about before the x and fuel five. They make one with a little caffeine in it too. So now I'll usually, if I want to caffeine, I'll just use that instead of the non caffeinated one. Um, but then I'll do like, you know, I'll still sometimes do a little bit of Soda, especially at the end of the race. Um, just to kind of change things up a little bit. Cause that's the other thing too is like if you do the same thing, you know, after a while it's like, just give me something different. Yeah. Well I know floyd mayweather drinks soda after he works out. Oh really? Yeah. And, and people were like, what an idiot. And I was like, maybe not first of all, maybe the best boxer of all time.

Speaker 2:          01:24:17       So definitely not an idiot. He's doing something right. He's doing something right and if he's that good on top of, you know, having a terrible diet, I think part of his like terrible diet as a joke. Like he'll eat cheeseburgers and shit and show you and say, look motherfucker, I'm kicking everybody's ass eating cheeseburgers. But not really. He really does help them when the chefs making some gourmet meal, I mean, he has a personal chef. There was a whole article about it recently, but I think that the fueling up with like really heavy sugary drinks after a very hard workout, it's not a bad idea to replenish the glycogen in your muscles. Yeah, I think that depends. I think like, I think the science is pretty clear if you're on a high carbohydrate or a least a higher carbohydrate diet that you know, carbohydrate and protein within like, you know, 30, 45 minutes of the post workout is going to be in your best interest of people like chocolate milk for that.

Speaker 2:          01:25:09       Right? Yeah. That's gotten, that's gotten kind of like labeled as that perfect ratio of a protein with shittier sugar. Yep. Where, where it's not clear or at least it's, it's getting clearer is like where the variants there is for someone like myself who following a high fat approach and we have added a little bit of a glimpse into it from some studies. Uh, and I, the interesting thing is what they did this one study called a faster study, um, and it looked at, uh, like it was 10 guys who are on a high fat diet and 10 guys from on a high carbohydrate diet and the guys on the, they tried to pair them up as twin, so like similar like performance achievements, a similar like body metrics and then kind of compare the two in the high fat cohort. Actually when they finished the, one of the workouts was a three hour treadmill session and then they were, they taken like blood tests and stuff and they had like the oxygen mask and things like throughout the course of it.

Speaker 2:          01:26:06       And they tested things before or after. Um, and one thing that they saw was like, uh, the, the high fat folks actually had this kind of big like surge of glucose in the bloodstream post workout. So the thought is like, you might not want to double down on that if you're in a fat adapted state because like, I mean, some of the levels, this is, it goes back to, it would have been like, like this is what something I'd like to ask a doctor a tia about. Um, is that like you get these big kind of post workout, like blood glucose spikes sometimes to the level of like what would look like a type two diabetic. Um, but it's not, it's not, it's, it's in a different context than what you would see in someone who's just like following a normal diet where that would be kind of a red flag.

Speaker 2:          01:26:50       And, um, so like to, to hit the body with another source of glucose essentially might not be affecting you the same way. So yeah, it's, it's, it's interesting stuff. So like, it's actually like, um, what I've done sometimes too is after a big hard workout, if I'm not hungry, I don't always eat right away. I wait for my stomach to come around and like my body to say, you're hungry. Just to let all that stuff kind of go through. And then, then I'll have a, depending on, depending on what I'm doing next, like all, if I'm, if I'm taking an easy day or a couple of easy days, I'll go like really low carb. But if I'm going back out that afternoon for another workout or the next morning for like a speed session or something out, that's when maybe I would try to drop in a little bit of carbohydrate to kind of speed up the glycogen, uh, side of things. So I'm ready for that next one. Well, Zach, you're a bad mother fucker. I wish you all the best and I really appreciate you coming down here and talking to us and it's a fascinating what you do, man. Thanks for having me on. Thank you. Thank you very much, man. Thank you.
