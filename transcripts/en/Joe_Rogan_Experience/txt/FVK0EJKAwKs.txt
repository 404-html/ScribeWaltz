Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Whether my brother just has this expression where you just kind of gives me the slow nod, which is he's gone, you know, my father was dead and I went in and I saw him on a Gurney and shit and it was so strange and I go outside and I was a smoker, like cigarette smoker in those days I was going to have a cigarette and uh, Donald comes out and I was like, uh, oh, this is a shock and whatever, you know, we're upset and stuff. And uh, I said, how was it because he was there. I said, what happened? And Donald tells me the story of like a dad woke up and had this like big reaction. Like just like, I'm hot, I'm hot, there's thrown the sheets off. And Mom Freq test. She's like, what's the matter? What's the matter? She told Donald Call, I'd call the ambulance, call the hospital, and he was gone within seconds.

Speaker 1:          00:00:42       So that's bad enough. You know, he was hot and uncomfortable. You don't want to hear like, oh, he died in his sleep and we woke up and he just didn't. But then my brother says, this thing probably defined my life. My brother goes, uh, he died screaming and I go, what? And he goes, he, he died screaming. And I was like, w I mean as, is that a figure of speech? And he goes, no, he literally, he died screaming and you could see my brother was haunted by it. And my father wasn't like a, I wouldn't say he was a butch man or a strong man, but he wasn't a soft men money stretch of the imagination. And I never heard him get real loud or anything like that. And the notion of my father dying, screaming, changed my life. Cause I was like, even a good man in this world.

Speaker 1:          00:01:27       You played a game, he played straight. You play by the rules, you do everything you're supposed to, you're going to die screaming. And at that point I was like, there's no point in not trying to accomplish every stupid fucking dream I've got. Even if it's dumb shit, like fucking, you know, Oh my God, I've always wanted to collect this money. Fucking a Wayne Gretzky cards in one fucking binder. Or if it's like I want to make a movie, or if it's like I want to put on a podcast or I want to do a TV show now I want to write a book, chase it all down. Chasing whimsy is what I've been doing for the last few years. Just smoking weed and chances went whimsies anytime I'm like back in the day, I'd have a good idea, something I really wanted to follow through on it. And also you can get scared.

Speaker 1:          00:02:03       You start thinking about some of what some of the fucker's going to say and be like, oh, it's stupid. Why would you fucking do that? And fucking why? Why? A lot of why people in this world, I try to surround myself with the why nots motherfuckers who you're like, I want to try this. Like why not? Let's go, let's give it a shot. You gotta be game man. People help you achieve your dreams and shit. So for me, the last few years I've just been trying to accomplish every dopey dream to big shit. The little shit you got to do them all. You can't just do the climb every mountain shit, you know he did sometimes late a bar down, step over it and be like to the house so you feel accomplished but chase it all and do it all because we're all gonna die screaming and you might as well enjoy it here and I and when I say chase Saul, don't fucking do it at the expense of someone else.

Speaker 1:          00:02:44       Obviously don't hurt somebody else but go after your dreams man. If your dream is to like I want to kill 12 children, that's, I'm not saying I'm not talking to you, but go after your dreams if they're not going to hurt anybody. You seem now I wish I knew you before you became famous because you seem like if I had a guess, I bet you haven't changed at all. Pretty much know how did you navigate that? That's a very friends, those dudes like those days that I was like kitten, the bell, like they don't want it do the show and that is that they, they really don't want it. I mean, not really like Kevin, we don't want to do this, but Walter is just like, Oh man, they just grounded you so much. You never gave into the tide of those two craziness. I've got friends.

Speaker 1:          00:03:21       I mean, I've never had butch friends who like fucking punch you and wrestle lunch called butch. I mean it is to a fake dude like me. That's Bush, Dude. Those are bullies. But like the hard Boyz is, my mom used to say it was good. We'll leave those hardy boys alone. Kevin, I never had, I didn't have the rough house playing around like let's wrestle and shit like that. What I had was more psychological, more oral, and that sounds dirty, but I don't mean oral. More like the dozens. Motherfuckers keeping it tight. You grow up fat, you gotta be fucking sharp. Stand your toes or else you're a fucking victim every time you walk in the room, because most of the world don't look like you. So you get sharp. You learn how to fucking take yourself out first before anybody else can steal their thunder.

Speaker 1:          00:04:03       Hey, I'm fucking fat. And then people are like, oh, you know, you know, and then there you've removed their fucking card. He'd taken their biggest weapon out of their quiver to biggest thing they got and then suddenly you've changed the focus and hey, he's easy with himself, blah, blah, blah. And it makes people allegiant, you know, just all that shit you pick up over the years, you see it. It's, it's what shapes you. It's what makes you who you are. So being able to hang out with people who were quick enough to like shred you, but you had to be able to protect yourself and funny. And it's like hanging out with Ninjas all the time who just or not in India so much as Keto from the old pink panther movies were just hired them to literally attack him out of nowhere. That's what your friends do.

Speaker 1:          00:04:41       They just like attack you out of fucking nowhere. And so by doing this all the time, it made me sharp, but it also kept me very, very real. So these cats, even when the movies would take off, where were I was doing this one or this one, they were never like, oh my God, the fucking, we had no idea you were hidden genius. They remain the same exact individuals. So I didn't like that one. Oh fuck yes. Really? Yes. Oh yes. In a heartbeat. In a heartbeat. They'll let you know and they'll let you, like I brought them on a mall, rats to come work on the movie and stuff and they made it, they were in it in a few scenes but they worked behind the scenes. They quit after about two weeks cause they're just like, I don't want to do this. I have no interest in this.

Speaker 1:          00:05:19       I mean, and that's cool. Like I respected that. I was like [inaudible] that's Brian. That's Walter. Like that's who they are. Rather than be like, all right man, we're going to do it because it might upset Kev if we don't. They're just like, oh we don't want to do this dude. What makes the Dyno self kind of thing? I'm sorry, what makes you think that without them you wouldn't be you though? What makes you think that without them you wouldn't have pulled yourself to the ground? I wouldn't have had that sense of humor. I think my sense of humor largely came from them, largely came from my friend Brian Johnson and Walter also kind of shaped it to some degree. I was, I've, I was funny, like don't get me wrong. And, and high in high school I write sketches for the comedy shows and Shit like that.

Speaker 1:          00:05:56       But I there it was their sensibility married to whatever sensibility I had is one of three kids, raised Catholic and highlands New Jersey. That clicked that like kind of made me the version of me, you know, the person that you would want to meet or the person like that was different was like Kev 18 years old, 1718, before we started hanging out with Brian and Walter. Um, those were the cats that kind of helped me define who I was. And if you look at clerks like that movie is [inaudible] Dante and my friend Brian Johnson has meant to be Randall. The guy that I most wanted to be like, he knew, always knew what to say was fucking funny in a room and shit like that. Really misanthropic and stuff. And so that it kind of all communicated without those cats that I don't think I know I wouldn't have the jobs I've had cause I wouldn't have the sense of humor I have now. And I don't think I'd be if, let's say I got into entertainment somehow, I doubt I'd be as grounded. Knowing those dudes have kept me kind of grounded for years. That's pretty cool man. It's good. It's good to have something like that and your life, man. Well, I have any similar can weed, why aren't you smoking weed? I thought this is a weed show. We already got high and

Speaker 2:          00:07:03       let's get higher experiencing it. Hire Kevin just gave me a heart attack and he did his even realize it. What way? What way? By talking about all that life thing. I almost died a Friday night when I, uh, was out. And you just told me, and I'm like, uh, I was at a karaoke bar in Burbank right across the street from a, the Jay Leno show, like the NBC building temples. I've see, I've, see, I drive past that. I've seen that place. I came out, me and my girlfriend around 1130 when we walking out the front and we parked. So I'm opening the door for her to get in. I have no where this big, tall black guy, about six to wearing a fake gray beard, like a Santa Claus beard that was like tied on with white strings and a hat in this big Hobo jacket shows a gun in my chest and was like, give me your fucking wallet. Oh man, you're harsher. My boss. Yeah, nevermind. Keep going. And then my girlfriend was, my girlfriend was pretty drunk.

Speaker 2:          00:08:02       That's good. Here's, my girlfriend was pretty drunk, so because she has like social anxiety, so she drinks, you know, when she goes out, she thought it was a joke. She looked over and thought this was like a character or something. Right. And so he's like, give a shit, you're shaking telling him, you can tell it's still fun. Yeah. Fucking night, I would fuck me up, keep going. And so he said, uh, he said, um, you know, give me your fucking purse bitch. And she just like, like looking at him, like what? Like she was drunk and shocked and I'm like, give her, give him the person. So I get gave her or she gave him the purse and then he goes, get in the car, lay on your fucking stomach. And he's shoving the gun in my back while I'm laying in the car. And I'm thinking like, all right, this is like execution style.

Speaker 2:          00:08:39       Like he's telling me to, you know, get in there and then suddenly he goes, get laid down to the, to my girlfriend. And she laid down on her back because she was just so freaked out. He said, I said later on your fucking stomach bitch. And he's like, she's shoving a gun in her back. And then finally we just like both laying there and then he slams the door and just takes off. And so now, like the other day I was at the grocery store and I saw a black guy that was tall and I'm now I'm like freaking out like, and if it was a red head that robbed me would have been the same way. But now I see these guys and I'm like becoming like a racist from the 50s now where I'm like walking around, I'm like, what's he doing on my side of the store?

Speaker 2:          00:09:10       You know, like it's crazy. It's like at this point you had your, you were in that moment. Yeah. What did you, what was it like? It was really when I was laying there and it was like, this is it. And but you think that they think, what did you think? You know, I didn't think about anything except my girlfriend the whole time. And I'm like, cause hearing him yell at her, that's just you. You think that you can just kind of look around and look for a weapon or something like that. But when you're in that biggest shock, you're just like, oh, I wouldn't look to fence lines. So not the butch dude. That's again, there's a word I'm showing up. The dude that's like, where's a weapon? I'm going to do this. My immediate, my reaction is going to be like, let me suck your Dick.

Speaker 2:          00:09:46       Let us go. I will suck your Dick until you let us go and he's like, you've got a girlfriend. I'm like, still, I'll be better than her. Yeah, I can really deliver. I, that's where I go with, I would never go defensive or offensive. All these people in line, of course it's like, Doug, what'd you get for not doing Jujitsu? Like if I had two guns in my pocket, I still was doing it, but fuck yeah. I mean if you add yourself strapped the dynamite, maybe then you could be a little, look at this bitch, right people, those you should have. People should shut the fuck up. No one knows what that's like until that happens to you and you should always give someone what they want. Usually they just want to fucking get your money and run away. They don't want to shoot you.

Speaker 2:          00:10:21       Is that the case? Usually you hear at once in a while though, like, like Old Lady, you know, did nothing still gets shot or something like that. If it's a young kid on fucking PCP, it's really a gamble. This is a birthday and then time where you believing about midnight and three months before that or six months before that I was in Fuddrucker's in Burbank and some guys like stealing this girl's person running out the door and I'm chasing him. I'm like, I'm in Burbank right now. Why? You know, and we talked about, uh, the Kmart shooting in one podcast, the, the, the, there was a shooting at Kmart in Burbank and the officer that got shot was the one that came to rescue me when the other night. And I was like, you're the, you're the one officer. And he's like, yeah, he got, he got shot in the leg and stuff like that.

Speaker 2:          00:11:08       And so he became like a celebrity guy because, well he's been shot at in Burbank and, and Kmarts like, you know, makes saw him on TV. But it's like, it's like, it seems like you always hear Burbank is so safe and stuff you don't think at Burbank is like Bob and lived there. How could it be right there could be no terror. Well, liquid lake. I wonder how many checks one of bone, that guy because he, the celebrity cop that got shot. Well I had to wait a bunch. Right. Gotta be right. There are checks that doesn't fuck fat dude. You gotta be checks that wanna fuck fucking a hero cop. He wrote cop that got shot in the leg. I bet that guy gets beaten off the pussy just waiting for forensics. Like I had to wait like four hours because I mean this is like the closed off helicopters and everything.

Speaker 2:          00:11:50       That was like cops and stuff and then they wanted a fingerprint, my car. So I'm just sitting there and he's like going ask him my girlfriend like questions like weird questions like, so what do you do? Oh, you're dance. Uh Huh. Yeah. Well you look like you ain't and stuff like it was a computer. No, he was totally an awesome, nice cop. But it was kind of weird like hearing like my girlfriend having to talk like, yeah, it was an exotic dancer. No, but just asking weird questions. And then was he going as close to hitting on her as he could and still remaining a cop? Was he doing like with this guy? Yeah, he was, I don't know. You see me and they see my girlfriend. Maybe he thought I was like paid for her, like if she was a hooker or something, you know, like how long do you know this guy you gotta like he said exactly in Brian Flux, we'll reserve. But, but what's weird is, I don't even know what it was weird. Oh, but we're just, when he was talking to me and asked me all these questions and he goes, well, and I was like, yeah, I would like to be a cop, but I like marijuana too much. And he goes, yeah, I see that. Yeah, you know, marijuana. And he's like, it's going to be legal soon, so don't worry about that. And I was like, all right,

Speaker 3:          00:12:51       this cough is Korea. I don't know if he's got a fucking crystal ball. Yeah, come on man. Come on. And that was the only silver lining to that horrible story was like at the end of it, the cop was like, don't worry kid. One day we, it's going to be lean now I'm scared of black wizards. Wizards. I'm going to be, Halloween are going to be one black wizard. It's going to tack it onto the Spring Mass at any be an internet. Me and my friend, black wizard wizard. You're scared of monsters. You know like where I was smoking my strike. Let's get a werewolves, bro. I love you were a little stir. Now I'm scared of Jaguars and pants. Did you find the monsters or the video? I tweeted the other day of a Jaguar killing a fucking crocodile. Somebody tweeted it to me and I retweeted it.

Speaker 3:          00:13:32       It's a Jaguar killing a fucking crocodile. How scary are Jaguars? I don't think there's a crocodile in the reference you've made to a Jaguar. You they do care. Care led Zepplin and big cats. The cats to me. Yeah. Well, not here, unfortunately, but there are pumas in this neighborhood. Really? Oh yeah. For Real. Yeah. Whenever we see deer, this deer in this neighborhood and there's pumas. All right, so there's two. It's not stay out of this one at Burbank. It's not uncommon that people have spotted them in this community several times. Really? Like mountain cats. I mean there's there, there's a known population of them that live like around Topanga Canyon in this area and they travel really far. Like one of them, they tracked from South Dakota all the way to Connecticut. They get hit, he got hit by a car and Connecticut. And they had decided, I saw this. Yeah, they did the DNA test on this fucker and they found out that it's from South Dakota. So this is from a group of genetics from South Dakota. This thing had walked 1800 miles. He was looking for sugar to put in this to a lump. Ooh. Three or, or a dog or two eating some nice plump dogs along the way. They do downing months.

Speaker 3:          00:14:42       All right man. Let's change up the topic cause you're scaring me now. Now I don't want to go out to my car and this neighborhood and I don't want to watch the video of the Jaguar killing a crocodile cause it's fucking amazing because you think you look at a crocodile and you look at that as a God damn dinosaur designers, farmer, evil lizard. Like what? Who would fuck with that? And the Jaguar, it's just like playful with this fucking crock. And I like knows it's going to kill it. Just playing with it. Swats added pause at it. Just looks for the right moment, get sideways on it and then right behind the fucking head. It's crazy. It's like what? Uh, if, if they're not scared of Croghan miles now do we have the US fleshy bags of pink, you know, these big black, muscular, evil looking cats

Speaker 1:          00:15:28       in a world where you been following up on a wildlife tech stores. You've been seeing all the bear stories like the two bears in Yellowstone this year, the Animal Beers, two guys who've been killed by bears in Yellowstone this year. It's rare you read that story online about the kid who got bit by a polar bear. Yeah. That was fucking astounding. The dude literally tells a story where him and his trooper on, you know, they're out in the fucking woods or something like that. And there's a kid sleeping next to him, a sleep in a tent. And this polar bear comes fucking through the tent. The kid woke up to like wailing and gnashing of teeth and the fucking thing, ground and blood all over its face and the thing bid him on the head, had his head in its mouth of polar bear had his kids had in his mouth.

Speaker 1:          00:16:13       And he said, it bits so hard, they cracked his fucking skull and he heard it crack in his head. And what he also heard in his head, louder than life, sense around style from the 70s was growlin because it's fucking mouth was over his ears. And he starts punching this fucking beast in the head, punching it, and they had real hard and shit. And finally let's go enough for him to like make a move or something like that. So He's, he survived the body. His body was right next to him died and they interviewed the kid and he's talking about, he's like, I got a lot of guilt man. Like it could have been me if I'd slept on that side I'd be dead. But I'm like, dude, you got your head bit by a polar bear. That's, I'm not going to say it's worse, but that's pretty damn.

Speaker 1:          00:16:59       So he got away and it just went after his friend next. No, his friend was done for, by the time the kid woke up, the polar bear had taken what it wanted, I think from the, his friend did Malta instantly it says face. Oh my God. Yeah man. Nature. What do you think it is? You think it's like they're hungry and a weather condition changes and they're just coming into the neighborhoods now. Cause you don't hear a lot about this back in the day, but a lot of it happening now. A lot of more shark attacks, lot more bear attacks. Maybe the really true statistically, well I'm asking, I know know more. Maybe it's just, I'm reading more about it.

Speaker 3:          00:17:30       Well, where we have more access to information. I do know that they said with this yellow stone attack to the last time there had been a death from bears and Yellowstones. It was an [inaudible] 86 yeah. Yeah. So that's a long time man. I mean, Shit, you know, that's a long ass time for nothing, nothing to get killed. And then all of a sudden two people get killed quickly. But those two people could have been sprinkled any time along the way. It's, you're in the wrong place. The wrong time. You Zig when you should have zagged. It didn't rain enough. So the fucking is not enough food and then all sudden bear start eating other things. Bears are omnivores. That's the crazy thing about them. They can eat whatever the fuck they want. So it's like us. But the terrible thing about bears is because they're not strict carnivores.

Speaker 3:          00:18:11       They don't kill their prey before they eat it. They just start eating as I'm going to stand for a bit and I just don't want the camera looking at my Dick. The whole, we could all stand. No, I just want to stress. No, no, I'm all good. How long do I stand for the cop not wait till it gets awkward and then I'll kick back down. Dear balls ever fall asleep from sitting too much like I've lately I think I've been sitting a certain way where it squeezes the blood blood pressure off on one of my balls and then it feels like my whole crutches a numb. That's the inevitable progression to you. Growing a vagina. It was going to happen. What happened? Balls are gonna, they're gonna melt together and then pop open. Like you remember that scene and John Carpenter's the thing where the chest cavity opens up and becomes a big mouth.

Speaker 3:          00:18:56       Yeah. That's going to be your new book comes off. That's your new pussy. No, my balls. I'll fall asleep. Usually. Never have you never had that happen. It's such a weird feeling. No, but my good. Should I try it? No, it's horrible. I do the Ari Shaffir sometimes though when I'm reading a, you know, he has a joke about, uh, taking a shit and his leg go numb and you'd get off and fall down to the ground. I read magazines all the time and the toilet, and you do, if you read magazines, you're essentially, you're choking out your leg. That's why Jiu Jitsu works. Jiu Jitsu works cause he cut off the blood and what you're doing when your feet go numb is you're putting all this pressure on yourself and wait, you're, you're essentially choking out your legs. You're making hemorrhoids. That's what it is. Yeah. Yeah. And when, when you choke someone out in a Jujitsu choke, what you're doing is you're stopping the blood to their brain.

Speaker 3:          00:19:37       You're cutting it off, stopping it from happening at squeezing it. And that's what you're doing when you're sitting here on the toilet. If you have this hard surface beneath your leg and then you're on top of your leg, you're basically giving your feet a slow choke. Oh my God, Dude. All right. I do this all the time. I do too. I sit on the toilet for so long. When I get up, I got pins and needles and I can't walk the hall and then like sometimes I'll try to man up and get through it, but by the time I hit the bedroom like you start laughing because it's so you're out of control because the nerve is are all dead and my wife's just like, how long when you get to learn, like you go in your shit, you get out. Like why aren't you staying in there till your fucking leg falls asleep?

Speaker 3:          00:20:19       And I was like, cause I'm getting shit done. But I, it's, I guess that's unhealthy. I read car magazines. Is that what you do? I go on the Internet. It's the only time I read car magazines. I don't, I won't let myself go in the Internet in the toilet. That's where it gets ridiculous. I'm like, I'm down to the occasional magazine at least. Let me finish up. Matt Taibbi Rolling Stone article in here on the crapper do wipe sitting up or sitting down. What the fuck you mean stand who you, I've never done that. You never stand in wiped up? Only

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       when I was a kid. And this is weird. Wow. All right. You're getting something out of me. I've haven't said publicly. It may be ever when I was a kid, I remember, uh, like I take a shit, I'm trying to remember what age the stopped, but I'd be like, I'm done. And somebody would get up, he'd stand up and they'd wipe your ass for you. And I think I did that till I was like seven, which is weird. It is weird. Yeah. But it was pretty good. Like in terms of like, I didn't really have to figure out how to fucking wipe my own shit for until that point. And then you had to train yourself to do it from sitting down. I think it's an ever perfected and ever perfecting art form the art of the wipe. It's not, you know, there's no one true measure and, and I think it develops as you get older, you learn better technique and stuff. But um, no, not since then. I've never stent, I'm a more of a front wiper though. Like I'll reach, cause I got a lot of back fat. Rather than reach around, I'll reach through my lean forward and reach through my legs. So I'm wiping almost like my man puss, but I clear the ball so it doesn't hit my balls or anything like that.

Speaker 3:          00:21:48       Fascinating. You walked away.

Speaker 2:          00:21:51       The wet wipes have really helped my life. They just come out of nowhere. It couldn't. They have those in the 70 [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:21:57       will Smith was the first one that called them to my potential. I mean they had baby wipes forever, but these flushables asshole cleaning of fishing out. Yeah. Big Time Man. He talks about it and he did. He literally talks about an interview. He was just like Barry Barry Sonnenfeld on men and black turned me on to wet wipes for handy wipes for, for going. And he's like, why would you use toilet paper when you can use this? And he's like, I haven't gone back since. And so one day I went out and got a pack. I was like, this is fucking amazing. It's like taking a, she flushed them, but these are flushable so you can at least say they're pleasurable. Let me tell you what happens.

Speaker 2:          00:22:30       I, I've used it for years and never had it

Speaker 1:          00:22:33       problem. You were probably about to, I had a set

Speaker 3:          00:22:35       problem with what not. I had a, I had a tree growing inside my, my pipe here. Oh Dude. It was the most ridiculous thing. I tweeted it. It's almost impossible to find now someone, someone on the Internet, I'll find it, but it's a, uh, literally there was a branch growing like it was huge. It's crazy root system and everything that was growing in my toilet, I kept having this clogged up toilet. Didn't matter if I port draino on it and nothing would work. So I had these guys come over. I figured they just going to snake the toilet. Will they cut out a fucking tree because nature is such a motherfucker that a tiny crack had grown in one of the pipes and these a route from one of the low, the nearby trees had forced its way into this and found out that there's all this water in this area. So spread apart the pipe by growing and then grew up the pipe. It's incredible. It was just an invasion by this plant species living off my poop and it was all clogged up with those little fucking flushable wipes, those flushable wipes.

Speaker 2:          00:23:35       You know how the flushable wipe comes in like that little treasure chest, you can just get like refill it and throw it in there. I don't do that for that long because if you look at like the taint or the button of

Speaker 4:          00:23:46       the thing, you know sometimes if you had a second wife you might have a little poo on your hand and that builds up. If you smell that it smells like an asshole. I never used the button bring, I just open it and draw them out for that very reason. I don't want to touch cool button ever. Yeah. What's up with that, right? Yeah. Poobah that's a silly move. Did they give you a rubber glove to use that thing was, that's what they should follow because you give you a rubber glove. That should be what? The wipe to the deep sincere. I'll take them. I'll go knuckle deep to why when you're cleaning yourself out. Exactly. You never know. If somebody gonna be like, tonight's the night I might eat your ass. So people are so funny about assholes. No real. Are these people uncomfortable about it?

Speaker 4:          00:24:26       Don't like you talking about your own. Just like certain things you can talk about. You can talk all day about your y'all. I have psoriasis on my elbow. It's really annoying. It's itchy and scratchy. Look at my Eczema. But you started talking about, man, I just, you guys ever like just massaging your asshole. Do you massage your ass off? Then people are like, what the fuck are you talking about? You know, you could say, dude, when I get home I'd massage my neck on the way home. You know, sometimes it gets so stiff. I just give it a solid massage on my own. I feel so much better. Yeah. Yeah, me too. I know what you mean. I like to massage my asshole. It feels really good. It feels, no, I don't, but, but if someone said that, you know, but do you know? No, that'd be awesome.

Speaker 4:          00:25:04       But it's something about you talking about your asshole and pleasure that makes me terrified. Does it really? Okay. I'll tell you a pain story about salaries because it's sitting on the toilet, as you said, for all that time. I got an anal fissure. Oh, Jesus. You ever had one of those? No. You never want one of these. This, I've never, I've never been punched in the face or choked out or anything. Fucking cool, but this was the most pain I think I've ever felt in my entire life. Really. It's that ring it, that sphincter is the fulcrum. Your entire body. You start to discover anything you do reverberates in your asshole. I know it sounds deep. It's not move your finger. You can feel it when arm. You can feel it and you only really realize it when there's something wrong down there. And an anal fissure is when there's a tear right on the fucking lip.

Speaker 4:          00:25:53       Uracil somewhere on the ring or this one extended it a little deeper and I, I didn't know what it was. It's painful, man. Like so painful that like I asked my wife and my wife's never fucking see me completely naked, let alone my asshole. I literally was like, I'm going to ask you to do that fucking thing. I never imagined I'd ask another human being to do. And she's like, what? And I was like, I'm going to lay on the bed. I'm a fucking crane. Open my two fucking cheeks. I'm gonna need you to look in there and tell me if something looks funky. Now I've never even seen my own asshole, but I know for a fact, dude, I've got hair down there too, so I'm, I'm, I'm telling her, I'm like, now you might have to deal with a little shrubbery down there. There's no manscaping. So if that's the case, you might have to move hair. And she's like, oh my God, please don't make me do this. Like there's

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       no one but you. I was like, I'm sorry. I wouldn't have, I was in pain, dude. It was, and I was crying. It's hurts so much. So I lay down, she's looking at it and she was like, I don't know. There's just so many roles, you know, she couldn't get to it. I was like, come on, do you see any blood? She's like, I think I see some blood. I think I see like an inflamed area. And I went to a doctor and the doctor, it's like, get up on the table and whatnot, and I'd never want to Approch tologist and I'm laying on the table and he opens my cheek and he doesn't even, he puts a flashlight on the outside of my fucking ring piece. He done, I'm waiting for her to like the fletch move. We're moving along river. He takes a look with just the flashlight.

Speaker 1:          00:27:22       He goes, oh, anal fissure. I go, really? Is that what it is? He goes, yeah. I was like, you're going to, you don't want to go deeper. He's going, I don't need to. And he's going, you don't want me to either. And I said, what do you do about them? It's going to give you two, uh, creams. One's topical, one a little more insertion. He's going, uh, basically, what was the figure? He said, God, I can't remember. He said, in eight to 10 weeks, you'll start feeling 50% better. And I looked at him like, dude, what are you kidding me? And it may not have been eight 10 may have been four or five but it was a long period of time, only 50% better. And I was like two that I don't like these odds. He's like, that's as best I could do. He's like, that's either that he can go for surgery, but trust me, you don't want that.

Speaker 1:          00:28:04       He's like, I said, what surgeries? Like, well basically we get in there and the needle and sew you up. I'm like, forget it. I'll wait for it to heal. And it was fucking misery getting in with a needle and sew you up. And then how long does it take for that thing? And then it takes her a while to fucking heels. So their whole thing is like, just keep prompting this topical on it and natural. It'll heal itself. Try not to fucking rough around with them. Like I don't want to even go near it. Going around with your bundle. Yeah, I'm like to use those terms, I said, doc, I went around with it son. I said like Joe Rogan, I like to massage my asshole. What will this mean for that? But he said, uh, he was like, it's very common. He goes, if you're in a room, 45% of the people in the room are dealing with anal fissure and he's gone.

Speaker 1:          00:28:44       Nobody talks about it. I said, why? He's gone because it has everything to do with your ass hole. He's calling people. He was saying the exact same thing. He's like, people don't talk about this kind of thing. Public, it'd be much easier because you wouldn't have people waiting as long as they do to come in. It's going, it's common practice. He says, you know how yours happened? And I was like, I don't know. I thought he was going to be like a lot of fucking bathroom activity, man. A lot of fucking blow glory holes and Shit. I said, no, no, I don't know how it happened. And he said, you sit on the toilet a lot. I bet. I said, I do. As a matter of fact, he's going, well, your weight sitting on that toilet and he's going, I bet you don't just go and leave. You sit there for awhile. I said, yeah, he's gone. It's just think about it. Gravity's just pulling it that you know, as you sit there, it's not like you're sitting on the toilet and your butt cheeks are clenched in your asshole is fucking tight. Is that how you do? I'll tell him nothing's getting in here. Excellent posture. Your shit comes out through your balls. My Shit comes out when I tell it to all look out. Do you never want

Speaker 4:          00:29:42       that? Oh my God, that sounds horrible. So I remember, so only 50% fist six weeks, 50% when we're done. Did it take until it was 100% oh, honestly it felt like months. I think it was months for months. All I could do literally was like lay on the bed, belly down. And if I took it on, oddly enough, when I took a shit, it felt better, but it only felt better for the moment on I was taking the shit because then I guess what? I don't know what I don't know. I can't even tell you the science of it, but when I took a shit, I felt better. As soon as I was done taking a shit. That's when the agony kicked in of like reminding you it was there and you would literally just flinch and squirm on the bed, like fucking withdrawn or something like that. It was men nasty. Yeah. The last thing you want to get household problem.

Speaker 2:          00:30:27       Yeah. It's the fulcrum of your body. I had to internal hemorrhoid for that reason and they had to do the rubber band technique where they Tyrol band around inside your asshole and he tight super tight so it gets no blood supply and it falls off. Well, I'm like this is this going to hurt? And he goes, no, it's more of an annoying pain. And I'm like, all right. I go home and it was like somebody shoving their like fingernail into your ass hole from the inside and just sing there and twisting it and turning it like a fucking shit passage. It's shit. Get caught up on the banner. No, I don't know. How big is this thing that you can wrap a rubber band around it and it was pretty big. And then her having get rid of the hemorrhoid or grape or whatever. I've had a hemorrhoid before they said that I was supposed to go back maybe two or three times.

Speaker 2:          00:31:09       This is a whole process. The first time it's probably not going to do it. I wouldn't go back to the second one. So now I live with the little guy and he's just this little teeny guy now. But once in a while if he eats like if I eat the wrong thing it blows up and is like Yo bitch, not Jews claim to clamp style. You still have it in there tied up? No, no, no, no, no. The rubber band dissolved but it's the internal hemorrhoids still exists. Yeah, he's got a clip so I just returns whenever it wants to. It went whenever I like get crazy, eat a bunch of hot peppers or for eating. It's hot peppers. It's a lot of fucking like caffeine. It's a lot of like really? I had heard that it's from greasy forcing your shit out. Monitors from pushing like I've got a resident just like yours is mostly quiet. Nice. Lodger but periodically, hey, if I'm down here and it's always fun,

Speaker 4:          00:31:54       I'm fucking up like on the toilet and I'm fucking pushing. Maybe I'm not ready to go, but I'm like, if I don't go now, I'm not going to be able to go for a couple of hours.

Speaker 2:          00:32:01       Once in awhile he shoots somebody and there's blood everywhere. You know it's like a code. Yes. Oh yes. My buddy. Yeah. Bloody nose. No big deal. Bloody asshole. Oh, for reals.

Speaker 4:          00:32:16       Want to go to the fights, dude. Some of them were last time around. I'm going to fight. We got to do it. Roll a camera on me though. Okay. So are you could watch me for sure. Well, there's, um, there's going to be a big card on Fox coming up real soon. Um, uh, I think it's November. That I don't want to say, I think it's the 14th. I have to look at his schedule, but it's, uh, it's going to be on Fox and I think they're announcing tomorrow who the, uh, the fighters are, but

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       that'll be an Anaheim. So that's fucking clothes. And you do all of them. Are you always the guy? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. All right. I didn't do this. I don't have to buy tickets for this shit. Yeah, we'll hook you up, man. Come on Dawg. Like you spend your money fucking Smith. Kevin Smith punched in that ring. I want to make sure to get paid. I'm happy. Oh they get paid a motherfucker now. They must be paid a little bit of our gate. Right. That's how it's different. I mean they get different deals but you know the gates, it's almost always sold out. Almost all the, almost all of the domestic UFC sellout. We've had a few problems and other countries where they really weren't like hip on the UFC. You know, Germany wasn't like the biggest success when we were over there. We don't like this stop hitting each other.

Speaker 3:          00:33:27       Didn't, it wasn't like, it's not like Australia. Australia sells out in like an hour. Whenever we put on a show in Australia, people go fucking nuts, but it was a little more difficult. What about cooking it on its, they blocked us from television or something in Germany too. There was something crazy or you can only get it on paper view. They couldn't have it on live television. Germany, Canada, Canada, Canada is great because I always find it's very similar to Australia or vice versa. Canada's awesome. I fucking love Canada. I would live there if it wasn't so confusing, you know, if I didn't have to pay taxes to two different countries, GST and pst. I think Vancouver's city's government and the province, you know you're paying, it's the saint and essentially federal and state taxes. Yeah, but then you also have to pay for American too. Unless you want to wait a minute.

Speaker 3:          00:34:10       If you want to live, if you want to live in another country, unless you want to give up your citizen's suit, you have to pay American taxes. Yeah, you would have to owe. If you're talking about doing dual citizen, I'm not saying I hate America, I just like, I would, I would live in Vancouver and Vancouver is that shit. [inaudible] fucking cities ever. I'd go for Toronto Hockey Hall of fame. I love Toronto, but it gets cold as a motherfucker. Don't whether I grew up in east coast, I grew up in Boston and I'm scared. You know, it was, you don't want to go back to Edmonton. I would lack eyes too, but my lady would never let me live in Canada. Man. You guys don't like Vancouver. Well, my life, Vancouver, I, she was at school there. I shot a TV show there and movie. They're like, I do, but it's not, I'm not into whale art.

Speaker 3:          00:34:51       All right. A lot of that up there, man. That and trees. Fuck tree. As a comic, you know, I, I traveled too much, man. I would stand up and with the UFC I traveled too much to risk being snowed in. So if I live somewhere like Toronto, I would always risk being stuck, you know, and you risk being stuck. It's not, it's not a sensible place to live if you're a traveler, unless of course, you know, you can, you know, figure out how to get out of town before the snow hits and you work your other and it shows up in the snowcat snow cat up that mountain. Totally, man. Just look out for the dude behind the fucking ah, with the ax. I do think that I liked that one. Did you didn't see that, that Jack Nicholson motherfucker shining. He couldn't shine that at all. That was a great God damn movie. Oh, it's brilliant. And Stephen King doesn't like it. You know that. Yeah. No. So

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       much so that he made sure they made another one. Assess makeup. Make a worst one. Make a terrible one. This other one was too good. Make a bad one. Yeah, that, that other, the TV movie one is tough. I never saw the TV movie or remember it. Even Weber from wings replaces Jack Nicholson right then and there. I mean my stealing Steven Weber because he, that's balls of steel dude. You know what I'm saying? To be like, all right, I'll give it a shot. The dude or, but to be fair is what heath ledger did years later. He stepped into a role at bat at that Jack Nicholson made iconic and stuff. That all being said, hats off to Steven Weber and movies a Tufts. It, yeah. It ain't the shining by parents.

Speaker 3:          00:36:18       It was on so many pills. He didn't even know what fucking, you know what position he was taken when Heath Ledger died, he was on so many different pills. Is that what they said? Yeah. Who knows? Yeah, he's his state of mind. I mean, when you hear it, all the different shit that he was on when he died, that guy, I mean there's, there's a lot of those. Don't give a fuck guys that can put in like spectacular performances like that. Like that heath ledger joker was a fucking pretty spectacular performance when a dude has something like that and sign of him, you know, you don't, that's a, that's an a amazing abundance of energy and you're not exactly sure how he's controlling that. Not everybody can have that kind of a burst of energy inside of them and, and, and put it under control. Some people like literally aren't capable of that kind of a performance.

Speaker 3:          00:36:59       You think he was, you think, I think he's probably had a little bit of crazy in a man. No little bit of crazy. And then he gets on pills. Some cats just make pretend real well. Yeah, for sure. No doubt about it. But with all the pill thing and that I don't want to place in his fucking like I was high. It's got into the headspace of the joker. I don't even think that. I don't know. I don't know. Not, I just think he's just good, but I'm just thinking that being really brilliant at something like acting and being completely fucking insane or like next door neighbors, man. Yeah, it's a thin line. I agree with that total. The ability to lock onto a character so completely and captivating

Speaker 1:          00:37:39       and create it real. Make it so real that you're sitting there like, look, I love that joker performance. It's spellbinding but I sit dial like one movie back and look at them and the gay cowboy picture that the performance he gives him that movie, that dude exists. Like the joker performance is big and it needs to be big and like pray. You never meet someone like that in your life, but you would meet the carer. I think it was ena Serenas he played the character he played in Brokeback mountain. That performance is so fucking frighteningly real. That was the first time I was like this mother fucker's or an actor. I thought he was that dude from 10 things I hate about you. But he had shops cause he made only one other actor will to others parks. Michael Parks did that for me and from dusk till dawn, like that's why I've read state exists. Cause I watched the opening 10 minutes of from dusk till dawn back in [inaudible] 95 I was like, this mother fucker's Yoda. Like how do I want to spend a month on set with a dude who can drop site performance

Speaker 4:          00:38:36       science, this fucking brilliant, this laser sharp, this other worldly. Um, but then the other one, God who was, I just had it in my head. What was the other one? I said parks. Oh, Billy Bob Thornton in a simple plan. Do you ever see a simple plan? That fucking movie is a, wasn't named guy. Did Spiderman movie was us as a movie with Bill Paxton. Uh, a simple plan. Bill Paxton, uh, Bill Bill. What's the, what did I say his name was? You know, Billy, what's his face? I was going to that new guy, guys fucked Angelina Jolie, Billy Joe, Billy, Bob Thornton, Jesus crap, Billy Bob Thornton and uh, and who else? Oh, Bridget Fonda's in it. This fucking movie is so good. So well done. It's about dudes who find money in the woods, drug money, and then they're trying to like, it's a simple plan. We're going to hold it and whack it up together.

Speaker 4:          00:39:30       We're going to wait some time and then it just gets more and more complicated and fucking horrible things start happening and shit. Excellent movie. Well done. But Billy Bob Thornton gives a performance in this movie where he ceases to be Billy Bob Thornton and you're just like, that character exists. The man who is in this movie, there's no connection to Billy Bob Thornton. Like it's literally a dude being possessed of someone else or something like that. He changes his look. Changes is deliver is every perfect example, I think to, to be that good you do. There has to be a part of you that's a little bit fucking crazy. And we know Billy Bob Thornton is a little bit fucking crazy, no doubt about Meryl Streep. She, you think she's a little bit of, she just keeps it together. By then she keeps her composure and then she just got better composure, more self aware, but that the demon inside her beats just as freely as it does in Billy Bob.

Speaker 4:          00:40:17       She just knows how to control it and our social life, but she can blast it out when she's pretended to be some other person. She can just let that fucking demon free. You know? Uh, Billy Bob Thornton is crazy as fuck. Yes. I think to a certain extent, yes and no. I think it's completely containable. Yeah. I, I've seen Daniel Day Lewis get interviewed and I think he's, you know, he's a brilliant guy who's clearly like doing it as an artist. You know, he's clearly got a good handle on the whole celebrity thing when the guy like, he quit movies to be a fucking shoe cobbler and he said his crazy deep, interesting Weirdo. That is one of those stories that like everybody knows that Daniel Day Lewis. Yeah. Abo think it captured everybody's imagination. Whether he was serious about it or not. It may have been his most brilliant fucking move because for the next 10 years, whenever somebody says Daniel Day Lewis, somewhere in the next minute they're going to go, you know, he was a fucking, he quit to be a cobbler.

Speaker 4:          00:41:12       He studied shoe making. Like it captured people's imagination. Like why would a guy this good at the job go off, quit and make shoes for what? He came back sooner or later. But that shoe thing captures people's imagination. And you think he probably went to it because it wasn't acting. It was the furthest thing from acting. Cause you're right, you look at dude, who gets into a role like he does, he probably does go to someplace fucking dark and you, you know, a crew, a bunch of years of doing that, one after another. Maybe go on a fucking make shoes in Milan. Feels good. Sounds good. Simple. Doesn't require much. Use a different part of your brain. No darkness and fucking Koblin. You know, unless one of those fucking witches show some of his movies where he does go dark are the darkest characters in the history of cinema, the fucking guns, gangs and you love it.

Speaker 4:          00:41:58       Jesus Christ build a butcher. That's what his name was, right. Jesus Christ. Who's at a fucking scary performance isn't any accent great. Yeah, he'd seems like he really would cut your fucking head off with a machete. One of the lucky. Really. It's real. You're feeling it all the way. The one and the only conversations I ever had with Martin Scorsese was after a screening of that movie. I was coming out of the theater and I hear somebody go, Kevin, and it sounds like Martin Scorsese were like, no way. Martin Scorsese would be fucking saying Kevin and I turned around and Martin Scorsese was sang Kevin. He was talking to me and I was like, Whoa, holy shit man. How are you? Did you ball tangle? I very much. You know what I'm saying? Like in a way of life. Like the way he called me wasn't quite peer, but it was like he had no reason to know my name exactly.

Speaker 4:          00:42:40       And he's like, what'd you think? I said, I fucking loved it man. Like an I'd stayed through autocrats, which I said, Oh my God, I love that. You got to tell me how did he arrive at that accent? And he goes, we found cylinders, old cylinders recorded around what is 18 whatever it turned the centered 19 whatever that period flick was set. He said, we found cylinders, which we just sat there and played and Daniel took the accent from there, worked on a little bit and took the accent from there. And I was like, what are the cylinder sound like? He goes, surprisingly crystal clear and like you could literally hear what a person like what that guy sounded like in that era. I see an amazing, I mean it was Danny Lewis is probably our best representation of it cause I bet he nailed it.

Speaker 4:          00:43:20       He must've, because we've never heard the cylinder. I've never seen him not nail something down. He played a boxer and it's the best version of an actor playing a boxer ever. He really looks like a boxer. Like as he's moving, he's doing everything correctly. The way he's holding his hands, the Lay's responding to being hit the ways following through with his punches, with his footwork. He leaves literally looked like he could be a professional boxer. This takes so much energy and focus to get that good. Like he didn't just look like an actor. He wasn't. They taught how to box like is a perfect example and I don't mean to diss them but Marky mark, Mark Walberg, whatever. The fighter and the fight. It was a great movie. I love this performance in the movie but when you watch him boxing it looks like an actor is boxing.

Speaker 4:          00:44:03       Okay. Really? Cause I thought he was like, it looks like you can box. I bet he can box. I bet he can box but it doesn't look like, like when you watch Daniel Day Lewis do it. Daniel Day Lewis is moving like a real professional boxer in. When you watch him, the Mark Wahlberg thing, it seems like I'm watching a movie watching a movie where there's boxing in it is there's a, there's a difference in the reality. What about Stallone? Did he convinced? No, no, he didn't look like a box and I never, I mean he looks like a guy could kick your ass.

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       Oh, they'll get a wrong. Louis does the does the way a way, a professional fighter moves is very specific. You have to, unless you're some Roy Jones Jr freak of nature athlete who can keep your hands down and do all kinds of crazy shit because nobody can touch you because you're so fast and your timing is so good. But there's only a few of those guys ever. And if you look at a classic boxer, they have very, you know, very simple characteristics. The hands are always up high. The Chin's tucked, the shoulders are up. Nobody does that in a movie and a movie. Everybody, their hands are down the throne, wild punches and flexing their muscles and it's my turn to hit you and then it's your turn. He hit me and it looks very obvious. Nobody, I've never get into like a 32nd 42nd embrace.

Speaker 3:          00:45:12       None of like where they have to get split up. You can't do it realistically unless you're going to let people hit people and you don't want to do that because you only got to get one shot at it and people aren't going to like it. No one's going to like a halfway fight and it's not it. It's like, I'm going to let you hit me and then I'm going to hit you back. We're going to agree that there's a certain amount of times we're going to hit each other. We're going to hit each other realistically hard. You can't do that. You can't do it. You can't fake it. I could do it. Yeah, because they can do it realistically, real easy. Let me ask you this. Other than Daniel Day Lewis, who has convincingly fought in a movie that earned your respect, where you're like, all right, that looks like it.

Speaker 3:          00:45:50       Other than Daniel Day Lewis was that bars too fucking high, dude. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Washington. Denzel Washington. When he played a ruin, her current started fucking hot. Can't you give me some of somebody? It's just like, nope, you need a guy like that. You need a bad mother fucker who just really commit over. Like my friend Terry Clay Bond, uh, trained him for some of that and he would go down to the Hollywood boxing gym. It was on Labrea and uh, he said that guy would be out there every fucking morning at seven o'clock. Blair in his music, in the parking lot, fired up, and he said he would run up the stairs and he would train like a professional boxer. He said he did everything I asked him to do, did it exactly the way I told him to do it. Skipped rope, sit ups.

Speaker 3:          00:46:29       When he's in there every day, he literally transformed himself into a professional boxer. There's a, there's only a few guys who can hit that level, that Daniel Day Lewis, that Denzel Washington level of commitment. And it was only a few guys who can do that. So Daniel, so that was the only two guys that I've ever seen that looked like real fighters. Daniel Day Lewis and Denzel Washington fighting each other. Who went Daniel Lewis, can the fuck add it as a crazy one? I had, it's gotta be done. So he'll get tired. He'll gas out. He'll start off strong. Daniel taking punches for talking shit, Bro. Talking about talking shit. I just have to guess if I looked at the boxer that Daniel Day Lewis was and I looked at the box or the, you know, Denzel Washington was, I think Denzel Washington. He looks like a very good athlete. Moves very well, but it looks more like Daniel Day Lewis is a real boxer. If we base it on their movie rules, then uh, Daniel Day Lewis held out long time as John proctor and the crucible.

Speaker 4:          00:47:32       Denzel Washington, one of the best actors ever, right? When you say, Oh God, yeah. And you know what they gave them when? When they gave him the Oscar for a, what was it? You Know Kong? No, that was the thing. They should have given them to them. Oh, right, right, right. That performance. If you ever go watch Malcolm Max footage, you know, on Youtube, but you can now they've got tons of it and nothing but free. Fascinating. You look at that and you realize like that. Do you want to talk about a Denzel Washington and up at six training like a boxer, he didn't even have youtube to pull clips from. He became Malcolm x. The mannerisms, the way he holds his hand, uh, as he speaks, it's in, it's crazy. He should've gotten, I think he got nominate. He should've won that year. He didn't.

Speaker 4:          00:48:17       Then they gave it to him years later for, to a King Kong and got nothing on me. The training day, training day, which he was really good in it. That's the thing. He's like, I remember when they first gave him the award, I hadn't seen the movie. I was like, oh, they're making up for fucking overlooking Malcolm x. But then you see his performance in that movie and what could be a simple programmer or a simple, a good guy, bad guy. He ticked that role to the next level. Um, so it may have been overdue payback for a fantastic performance. He didn't get enough credit for, but I think he earned that 10. I agree. A hundred training day. I agree. 100% this performance alone. Yeah. He, he, he legitimately seem like a corrupt cop. Yeah. He, he becomes it. He's the one of those guys. It was Russell Crowe guys sick.

Speaker 4:          00:49:01       You believe sociopathic and like him giving them the like smoking. Then he's like, you're smoking the wet and like he enjoyed it. He was a little malicious. Seem real. Very real when he was enjoying it. Yeah. I mean to, to put your minds that place to allow yourself to go there. You've got to get real close to crazy. You got to get right next door neighbors to crazy. You got to see crazy every morning when you're getting any cars morning. Crazy. What's the crazy issues? Who's who you worked with? Like I've seen someone go to that place. We on RedState we would Michael Parks. I don't think I've ever said Michael Parks and Melissa Leo went to weird places like incredible places where I'm like, Oh shit, this is other worldly stuff like true fucking actors, man. True across the Michael Parks is the preacher. Yeah. This and folks, if you see one movie this year, see red state, it's Kevin wants me to this movie.

Speaker 4:          00:49:50       Now listen, I had known that Eo thing. I knew nothing of what this movie was. I had no idea and I showed up. I showed up with Aubrey and we had not a fucking clue in the world as to what this movie is about. I assumed it was a comedy and I heard some whisper online. I heard it was a horror film question mark. That's all I saw. So I go in with an awesome blank slate and it halfway into the movie, I'm like, what the fuck is going on? I'm like, it may be 35 45 minutes in. I was like, this is the craziest fucking, this is Kevin Smith's movie. It's seats. You don't even, it's like you have to throw out everything you think of as a Kevin Smith movie. Kevin Smith movies are always fun. Comedies, you know, in this movie just gets so fucking crazy so quick and just keeps and goes.

Speaker 4:          00:50:41       And you know, I really, I appreciate so much about that movie, but what I really, well, the one thing that's staggering right off the bat was that guy who played the preacher, Michael Parks of Mosley. If that guy doesn't get nominated for the academy award, he loves so much attention, uh, fuck awards, right? Fuck, fuck theW who cares? You know, it's, I mean, to a seven year old man or this business turned its back on a long time ago and clearly has better chops and most of his peers who went on to other things, it means something. That award, it may not mean shit to me, like me getting awards, but him, that award means something and it's still, he comes from an era where it does mean it does mean so well. I wish we could substitute that with the, the greater opinion of, you know, whatever people, nice people all across the country and people discerning individuals.

Speaker 4:          00:51:30       If you watch this movie and don't think this guy's a fucking super genius, all that Shit that I said about Daniel Day Lewis, the exact same shit I'm saying about this guy, one of those right there, he was playing this fucking preacher and he had this one long non cut monologue. I mean the camera is on him for a long fucking time and it's all one run and it's brilliant. It's brilliant. He sucks you in to the point where you're shitting your, you know, this is going to, something terrible is going to happen. You don't know when you don't know what and it keeps, he just holds you there with this conviction in this character and this character is belief that is fucking scary. It's fucking scary. There's, you know, there's imminent death. Yeah. Like it's set up right there, but his performance is so riveting.

Speaker 4:          00:52:25       He's so, so fucking good at the craft that you'll put, cause the movie's moving along at a nice clip right there. We put the movie on pause and be like, Ladies and gentlemen, Michael Parks, and it does a fucking essentially a guitar Solo, the Most Amazing Guitar Solo you've ever heard. And rather than be like, move on, fucking get to the murders that we knew were coming. People that kicked back and go like, oh my God, that's so beautiful. And he finishes his solo and the movie begins again. It's, it's pretty weird. It's pretty astounding. Guitar Solo. What kind of music you or you saw it. It's him. It's his voice. I'm talking about a metaphorical, oh Jesus Christ and I was so high. More stone than me. I must be possible cause you keep going. You keep going and dragging me in with you. I'm telling you, I've been around at all. Vege wow. I'm an idiot. This ain't even happening. We're in this meditation tech. You're in the meditation tank and we're just having this conversation. How did that character come about? Oh yeah, for sure. I'll let you know how the character coming back at that guy, Fred Phelps. What? How much of this church

Speaker 1:          00:53:25       guy and basically that that dude created that character for me that create the movie for you a little bit. I mean it was kind of a two or three pronged thing. Like number one, I saw parks in from dusk till dawn, which was a Quinton's movie with Robert Rodriguez and he's in the opening 10 minutes. He's astounding. Like the, the this I, I love acting. I love actors, love people, actresses, people that could take the words off page, Meghan Sing. But you know, there's only so many ways to skin a cat and fucking, even the best of him, pretty much like concede the strings and whatnot. You know how acting works. Every once in a while you meet one of these performers or see of her former, you're lucky you get to meet him. It takes it off the fucking grid off the charts. This guy does this and the opening of this movie, which from dusk till dawn is a fun vampire, fucking Romp Romp.

Speaker 1:          00:54:16       Rather, this guy comes in and drops a performance that could have won. It showed him in a fair just world would have won a supporting Oscar nomination. Like you know, Judi Dench gets one for Shakespeare in love and she's in the movie. What? Seven or nine minutes? Parks in from dusk till dawn, roughly the same time and gives a performance that's as electric as believable as off the charts. Wonderful. But you know, it's a genre film so he don't get the attention and stuff. This guy fell in love with him. I'm watching a from dusk till dawn, 1995 to lendlease, lendlease sunset five uh, Bob Weinstein's. Thank you Manny [inaudible] and VIP. It's movie has a Gaf. Fuck Alan. I see the vampire movie and I went to go see this vampire movie made by Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez. But what I left there was with, I have to work with that man.

Speaker 1:          00:55:06       I don't know who that fucking man is. That sheriff guy in the first 10 minutes who? Spoilers, spoilers, movies. Fucking 16 years old, but just in case he gets killed, the first fucking 10 minutes whole movie. I'm like, no. That dude was the fucking truth. The absolute truth. I walk out of that theater, I go, I got to work with that guy to sit at the fucking feet of a Yoda like that. And like for a month on a set, you man imagining my mouth fucking information you can glean steel fucking benefit from. He's pure, pure genius enacting form a clear genius when you're watching him. It's so spectacular and riveting. So good. I told them there were days on set like I did. We didn't do many takes at all because we were just, you know, we didn't have a lot of money and she was low budget movie and when the performances are that good man got John Gum, I'm Melissa Leo, you've got parks, the crushing it take one and shit.

Speaker 1:          00:55:57       So you know, I'll leave it up to them and they're like, I'm good if you're good. I'm like, I know I got, I don't direct the movie as much as I sit there and edit it in my head on set. And because you don't direct Michael Parkinson when willing to do go up to him and be like, here's how I do it based on my experience. Plants Silent Bob over the years. Did he ad libbed any of that? Oh yeah. He got in there and definitely seemed like he could probably just start talking in that guy. Uh, he sees so in tune with that fucking character man. Yeah, he was, well, he, he had that script for what, two, three months ahead of time by the time he came to the set and I have no, I'm not the author of that performance. I got authored his own performance hands down there across the boards.

Speaker 1:          00:56:34       You don't direct the movie like Red State. You just let it happen. But all they should keep it on the tracks. This dude's like his, uh, he would, he had the script for a while when he came to the set. He is like, can I, can I have the space? Can you show them into space? And we brought them to the chapel and whatnot. They were still putting the finishing touches on it, but he kind of did a a laid out like the way you would lay out a dance. He essentially kind of didn't say the dialogue out loud but he would just sit there and you'd watch them kind of moving his arms and stuff and it looked like he was slowly waltzing by himself and they'd stop somewhere and ask somebody, put a mark here, blah blah blah. I'll put a mark here. Then he put it all together.

Speaker 1:          00:57:12       I got to see what he was doing the next morning he had choreograph this fucking thing. Like he could do it from top to bottom. Like he could do the entire scene, which was I think in the script. 12 pages, 12 pages of dialogue or something ridiculous like that and he could fucking do it from beginning to end. And you watch him hit his marks. He knew exactly where he wanted to ban stuff. So much so that like I had done a draft right before shooting and I was like, hey man, this is the new version of the sermon. And he fucking bristled. Cause he was like, no, no, no, no. I mean that's other stuff's great. What do you need this for? Blah Blah. And what I realized was because he was dialed in, like he knew what was going to happen when you hit that stage.

Speaker 1:          00:57:51       He knew where to be so that he could just let his art come out of his mouth. But he was still framing the movie for us, still commanding the stage. It's a movie, let's keep things moving. He wasn't content to just stand there and deliver dialogue, which he could have and he still would have fucking captivated you. Instead he choreographed his movement. Um, it, it, it was fantastic. He was a dude that just gave beyond given you, you know, I, I wrote it with him in mind going, I know what it's gonna sound like cause I'm a big fan of the students' work now. And even getting to the set, he would still deliver over what I heard in my head. Like, oh, like I remember, I'll never forget what a month, month before we start shooting, where in my kitchen's May John Gordon is Bruce through the movie and um, and parks and we're just talking about when we're going to go and it takes a while to get money together.

Speaker 1:          00:58:38       And so we're leaving the kitchen and that we're talking about something in the script and he stops and he goes, he drew delivers one of the lines and he delivers it so flawlessly. And it was the first time I heard parks do what would be avian Cooper. And so I was like, oh my God, parks. My heart skipped a beat and shit. He left and I turned to John Gordon. I was like, dude, he's going to win an award. I don't know what it is, but like there's no way people don't cite him. It was like it for that one line, he slipped into a, and Cooper, you could hear it. You can the Gravitas of the life that Michael Parks has led, informing like every, every job he did or didn't get an entire life brought to bear on this, he gave him, he gave a monster soul.

Speaker 1:          00:59:21       Like you look at that character on the page, very two dimensional, easy to hey Michael, put a sole on them where you know, you still hate them, but you're like, oh there's this somebody under there. You know, he's not just like a two dimensional cartoon. You could easily write off. He brought something to it and I wanted him to do two dimensional cartoon. Like I was just like, I'm gonna put you in track suits. Cause that's what Fred Phelps wears and you know, you could talk like him. He goes, I don't want to do that. If you want me to do Fred Phelps impression, get somebody else who's gone, man, it's fucking boring. He's like, I came to act. I was like right on. And he did charismatic instead. Wow. He's a dude, man. He don't fuck around. This is a duty as a straight shooter, you seven years old, he's not pulling punches.

Speaker 1:          01:00:00       He's going to tell you exactly are you fucking feels and he, what is it that have Bisbee a little intimidating though when you have that kind of a conversation with him. You wanted him to do that though, right? Yeah. I wanted him to do all this because of him and like he'll give, you know, like I'm a grown up so I can take good ideas, leave stuff behind. He gave me the wonderful idea of seen the movie. Like it ends with somebody going shut the fuck up from off camera without spoilers, spoilers. Um, that came from parks. It wasn't in the script, it was just, you know, just ended where it kinda ended without that. And parks was like, how about instead you go off of me and I'm trying to be vague. So it was not to spoil it, but I hope you remember what I'm talking about.

Speaker 1:          01:00:38       I do totally go off of me singing and then you go down to another cell and there you are, you know, and, and you see, given away way too much. Your movie right now it's a little bit, but again, I said spoilers, but I tune out folks. Yeah. But anyway, he goes to you say blah blah blah. He said that line. And I was just like, um, I said parks I would love to but I think it'd be weird in this moment I saw, I liked the idea that line. I said, but cutting to me in the movie, I'm not in the movie. And I think people would take people out of the movie and he goes, why? And I was gone because people would recognize me and he goes from what? And I realize like, oh my gosh guys, like not, he has no clue that like I've had this whole other career as far as he knows that it's red state and red.

Speaker 1:          01:01:28       So he only knows I made some movies, has no idea what they are, didn't know I was in them or anything. That was so sweet. It was going in pure, you know what I'm saying? Like this dude went in all about the craft and he drops science on that performance. And he would sit there from time to time like and be like, can I grab one more take? And I'd be like, parks, you can have as many takes as you want. We're literally all here because of you. Because I saw that performance and from dusk till dawn. So it was kind of like the whole movie was kind of a parks celebration. You know, people that didn't know him fell in love with them as we made the movie because the dude just every day you were awed by something he did. But you were sitting there going, oh my God.

Speaker 1:          01:02:08       Like do you remember when he started singing in the movie? At one point we had the whole chapel, you know, everyone in the chapel singing and, and I said, uh, for some other part of the movie, he said, Hey man, uh, while this thing's going on over here on camera, I'm going to push in on you. You want to sing one of those Gospel hymnals. Cause he picked the other one old rugged cross. I said, you got another one you want to go with? And he's like, yeah man, the AUC can sink farther along. You want that? And I was like, yeah, whatever shirt. Totally. And we shoot them, we're pushing in on him and he sings farther along. And it's Kinda is, it is in the movie. He's got this beautiful soulful voice. The men had made records. So, um, oh, it's, it sweeps me off my feet and it's a church song, but I'm still weighing into it.

Speaker 1:          01:02:49       Next day I come into work, everyone on set periodically here and go my father alone and they're all singing it and I'm like, it's good. I said, right? Like, it's catchy to like, yeah, for Jesus Song is pretty catchy and stuff. So he brought that to it to the elements of, of singing charisma, charisma. And that's what he went for. He said he wanted to play it as a charismatic, he had this whole backstory for like, you know, his not only even Cooper's father, but his grandfather, he was like, oh, he's very close with his grandfather, wrote a backstory. He's himself to create for the care. Yeah, he told me he's just like, look, he was tight with his grandfather and his grandfather was still fire and brimstone, who's charismatic, but he was still strict but it's grandfather is still also had a sense of humor for the kid.

Speaker 1:          01:03:31       So his grandfather would be the one in the kitchen, you know, pulling like a train whistle down with had one fist and lifting a leg and fart and with the other. So we were still kind of human so he loved his grandfather had Cooper even though we premium preached the holy word and he loved them for it. His father also preached the holy word, this, this killed me cause parks going on all eloquently. It goes, his father also preached the holy word, but he probably touched his dick. So we don't talk about his father ever. I was like, that's astounding dude. That's amazing. You just bizarre. But he gave it thought, he gave thought into buying the outfit duty, went out and picked out to the the wardrobe with Beth costume. A wardrobe person picked every piece. She was us like never really done that before.

Speaker 1:          01:04:12       Ghana, you know, gone out with girls who are looking for a specific sizes, but he right down to the underwear and the socks. The dude had to be involved in picking the choices that what aid he fell represented. Yeah. And he put the outfit together. I remember the first time she showed me a picture of him in the office, Beth Beth up past Beth Beth pock. Anyway, regardless, best shows me pictures of uh, a bin and um, and in his outfit, Michael Parks and I'm going, oh man, that ain't it at all. I was looking for a track suit, like this dude wearing Khakis and button down shirt and a tie. It looks like a school teacher. And I had, you know, had written, I'd read state in my brain for like five years, you know, wrote a five years ago. And I'd always had very specific idea of what he looked like, which was stolen from the look of Fred Phelps.

Speaker 1:          01:04:57       And I remember going like, I dunno man, like, how do I adjust this? I don't want him to wear this. And she, she was like, you might want to go with it. He's dialed into the costume and it was such a good choice because the clothes made the man like, I don't even know how else to say. I did sound, it sounds Corny, but the, the outfit made him just allowed to do what he had to do up there. He felt like if you see him early in the movie, at one point he's at the protests holding the cup of coffee outside is wearing just a jacket, a windbreaker and a tee shirt or some, but whenever he spoke the holy word, he would put on what, you know, his Sunday best essentially and this was his Sunday best, like the button down shirt with a tie and he believed in presenting, particularly if you're going to go up there and preach the holy word, you should look respectable and bullet all this philosophy behind just the outfit and the whole time I feared it until we want in front of cameras and I was like, this looks beautiful.

Speaker 1:          01:05:49       Like the outfit is perfect and in some weird way because it gives him this just air of respectability and that makes the shit coming out of his mouth that much more heinous. I realize I'm still standing. So he was uh, yeah, he's uh, that guy's a unique talent. It's hard to believe that it's taken them this long for, um, Mo, it's taken me this long to find out who he is. You know, like why doesn't America, Quentin and Robert Quentin Tarantino particularly made that guy charming, quick story. I love the story because shows you that we're all like fucking kids in this business. We go see the movie acquaintance guys own fucking movie theaters. House looks like a fucking real movie theater, movie seats, fucking popcorn shit. And he's got these awesome sculptures from his movies all around by this artist named cleat shields. Great own personal movement there.

Speaker 1:          01:06:40       Sits about 50 or 60 or something like that and maybe a little less. So we go watch red state. There's me, Gwen and parks, Michael Parks. And he liked it. He liked it. See they really loved, I don't want to oversell it, but he dug the movies so much. He watched it without us when he wasn't supposed to. Like he got the print two days early. We're supposed to watch it with them the day that we joined him and he was like, I'm gonna be honest with you. I watched her ready twice. Fucking love it. You know, I was like, oh the, you don't have to apologize but us fucking awesome and shit. So he watched it with us again. Then afterwards he goes, come in the house and you know, cause the theaters separate from the house and he brings us in the house and this fucking charmed me.

Speaker 1:          01:07:20       I will never forget this. He goes, I got to show you my tape. I got to show you my Michael Parks tape. And he goes into, you know, he's got a big entertainment centers, DVDs everywhere and stuff hightech everywhere. But he also still has VHS. Dude lays hands on a fucking VHS tape almost as if I thought I hit the fucking flux capacitor cause I haven't seen one in a while and they're scribble on the fucking side and marker. Because remember we used to ride on the side of our video tapes when we made our own tapes. Um, Beth, the best of Michael Parks and Quentin throws this tape in and what it is, is he such a fan of this guy's work, he loves him. Gone back to then came Bronson. He loves this dude's work so much. Anytime this dude's going to turn up on TV or it gets a video of him, he v he records from tape to tape or from TV to tape the segments of his performance, everything that Michael Parks and particularly the highlights and shit.

Speaker 1:          01:08:18       So what you have is a collection of like some of the cheesiest exploitation, straight to TV movies or straight, you know, Blake about of high school volleyball team or college volleyball team and stuff like that. Murder mysteries and whatnot, like real programmers. And as he's shown you the clips, even though it's programmers all around him, Michael Parks is still in each one of these scenes that Quentin is pulled off and put onto this VHS dropping science performance science where you're just like, this is crazy. Like this dude's doing Shakespeare in the middle of Shit and yeah, not to put off, you know, anybody who made those movies down or off or whatever, but clearly like everyone else has kind of like, you know, here we are collecting a check and that is about the best furthest we can go. And this dude is like crushing it, crushing it.

Speaker 1:          01:09:10       Like what movies? A lot of TV, I don't even know them do Darl TV movies from like the sixties and seventies is a little bit into the 80s and that's what Quentin had collected. He would like this, he's got an encyclopedic knowledge of, of cinema and even bad trash cinema. There is no such trash, such thing as trashed cinema to this guy. He watched that movie and he found gold like diamonds in the midst of Shit that was just maybe simple or fucking program and material. And he collected them for years on a fucking VHS tape long before he ever knew he would be a filmmaker, long before he ever knew he'd meet Michael Parks, let alone become a film maker, make movies with Michael Parks and them direct Michael Parks and inspire me to make a fucking movie where I put Michael Parks in it like he, that's what he said to me. It's like, oh my God, he's gone as a Michael Parks Fan, I love this.

Speaker 1:          01:10:01       This is an, Oh, this is the ultimate Michael Parks movie. I was like, right, right. So for me it was, that was, I loved that the tape dude, he still had it. If he had just told us the story of ice to this tape, man, when I had the best, that would have been cool enough, dude. But he produced it and we all watched it together and I sat in a chair off to the side and him and park sat on a couch and it was there. I would've rolled the tier if it wouldn't have embarrassed him both or made them be able to get out. Um, but there they were like the man whose, whose work that this kid, filmmaker loved so much. Think about the shit you made mix tapes of when you were a kid. He made him this guy's performance and there he is watching that very same tape with the guy on the tape, the WHO, you know, the actor he loves.

Speaker 1:          01:10:46       Oh, it was touching. That's inspiring. But it's also inspiring that this guy's like Tarantino out. They're real enthusiasts, you know, due to get really fucking super excited about some shit and that's like you with, with fucking MMA or whatever. Fuck. Like the shit that you're into your super into you get geeky about. Yeah. Yeah. He does Kiki fucking movies. And that passion will translate to an audience for everything. When, uh, whenever it is that you're doing, man, I never want to see a fucking, you was UFC, UFC fight, but you, when you talked about it in the shower was just like when you came on our show, I was like, Oh, you know, I would go see this now. Like you, when you talk about it with the passion, enthusiasm you do translates to somebody who was never sold before and I wasn't even on the fence really. But then when I watch you talk about, I'm like, this motherfucker's smart. Like he's one of the smartest dudes I ever met that everyone was running the organizations. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:11:38       intelligent. It's, it's, it's a totally different thing than what people expect. Right? Hear the term cage fighting. You think, well, there's going to be a bunch of, you know, barbaric assholes and you know, and, and, and mean people beaten up. Other mean people. That's not what it is at all. I mean, what it is, is people that are trying to attempt to do the most difficult thing in all of sport. Put your body and your health at risk to go after another person's body and shut it down and taken out. It's the craziest game of all time. But it's the oldest game of all time. Male dominance over other men. And look, we have a society where obviously that's illegal. You can't, you can't beat people up. You can't. It's good. We want everything to be civilized, we want, but in the midst of evolution, when we find ourselves in this, this stage along the way from changing from a a wild animal to a conscious being, we still got a lot of chimpanzee DNA that needs to be satisfied and there's one or two ways to do it.

Speaker 3:          01:12:34       Either you can suppress it, you can pretend it doesn't exist, or you can give it something like porn or violence on television and movies and in, in, in, in, in, in sports. You could give it something to live vicariously through. I like porn. Yes. If, cause, if you don't have these other ways to live vicariously through it, there's only one other way around it. You have to go find whatever it is you're looking for, whether it's fine violence or find sex. But if you can get violence and sex and a television form, you can eliminate it from real life. The Japanese have believed this forever. The Japanese believe that you know, you're much more likely to commit a heinous sexual crimes if it's difficult to get laid. You know, there's so freaky over there. You can buy used women's panties and dispensers. It's ridiculous. You put some cash, you buy underwear.

Speaker 1:          01:13:18       Porn is, there's no pubic hair. It's only nipples. And even those are kind of very strange shaking out. But their animation and their comic books. Yeah. Fucking like intense. A lot of bondage.

Speaker 3:          01:13:32       Giant Cox two, yeah. Giant vein later. Not Allowed to see hair, pubic hair. So bizarre. Yeah, they have a, it's an, it's got to be weird when an entire country looks so similar physically. I mean, obviously you can tell the difference between one Japanese guy to another. I know a lot of Japanese people, but essentially the vast majority of the people that live in Japan have this one look dark hair. You know, the, the, the Japanese look, I mean, they are a clear race, you know, it's gotta be so strange to be a part of such a specific ethnicity. Like I'm a Mutt. You look like you're probably a month. You're a mud. You know, we're a combinations. I'm a little bit of Irish, a little bit of Italian, but you know, I'm just a white guy, you know, to most people. But when you, you know, Japanese people like Dan is a very clear race, has got to be very strange to be a part of like a real powerful dominant like, you know what I'm saying?

Speaker 3:          01:14:27       Like, it's like, like you look at like, uh, like, like it's some Italians, you can see this and you know, you, you, you look at them and go, oh clearly that guys some sort of an Italian guy, you know? Or if not he's Armenian or something like that, you know, that the sort of dark look. But it could be a bunch of different things Japanese guys look like Japanese guys, you know, if you understand what like the w with Asian people look like, you know, Koreans have a different look to them. But it's, it must be interesting to be a part of like one of, I mean, how many millions of Japanese people are there, you know, and to have such a similar look with all these different people that like you that you could be recognized immediately somewhere else in the country. You know, I think it'd be awesome to have a culture, like they have a culture.

Speaker 3:          01:15:09       Oh if you feel like we, I mean we have pop culture, which thank God cause that's why I have a job, but they have a culture that goes back eons and we don't really didn't add them in. And as, as White Mutts, we don't really have a culture that goes back eons. What always impressed me about the Japanese is the culture of discipline. They've had this culture of, of discipline and of martial arts. You know, the discipline of, of, of war and strategy like way before any of the European countries ever figured out what the fuck was going on. Right. You know, the, this Shogun, this tattoo that I have on my arm is Miyamoto Musashi battling a tiger. This is a, this famous Samurai guy. And um, he wrote this book called the Book of five rings. Some amazing book man, where you got to get into this guy's head that he's living, I believe it was the 15th century.

Speaker 3:          01:15:59       So I think it was like the 14 hundreds. I'm, I might be wrong with what he, whenever he was writing this book, basically he was a Ronin so he would travel the earth. He had no, uh, no master. He had no emperor. So he was traveling the earth basically having fucking sword fights with people. He had like 60 duals one-on-one duels with other men and killed them and hand to hand one on one combat. I mean, it's a crazy thought and thinking about killing people with swords. This guy did until like 60 different guys swords. And in, in some situations he, he thought swords are too easy. So he would use, he would let them use a sword and he would use a stick and he was fucking, it was a fascinating character, but his, his whole life was based on unbalance. It was about art, it was about philosophy, it was about, it was about seeking the correct way. And for him, the way of the sword was simply the way to be successful. The most successful movements in any given situation as far as what combat is. But he acquainted this combat to artistic integrity, the ability to create things freely, the ability to draw and paint, the ability to write poetry and and, and to elegantly

Speaker 4:          01:17:10       express your feelings. To him, it was all connected. It was all one piece of excellence and that is like a guide to live your life by. And he had this, this, this statement that I read when I was a kid and I always stuck with me. Once you understand the way broadly, you can see it in all things. And the idea, the idea being that once you find out how to tap into anything, it's like find out how to be a great movie director. Find out how to be a, a great guy draws animation, a fucking singer. Would a chess player and say it again, say you're fine. The, once you understand the way broadly, you can see it in all things. This is a translation from Japanese, so it's not probably not totally accurate, but what, what, that's what he meant is that you find greatness.

Speaker 4:          01:17:55       You find greatness as a carpenter, you find greatness as a Samurai. Does that same thing when you just tap into the zone where you're just really tuning into whatever the fuck you're doing and then you let creativity sort of spread it out for you. Comes better with age too, doesn't it? But it's just like it comes with awareness. I think blue awareness and not even just with age. I think the age is just experience and that's awareness or eventually a quick learners. I don't think it's necessarily just an age. There's a lot of people that they get older and they, they put that box closer and closer to their head. You know, they want to see less and less of the world. It's, it's all your, you're seeking as well. You're not trapped in some sort of a box every day, so as you get older, of course you're, you're going to get more tuned into things.

Speaker 4:          01:18:41       You're constantly still asking the questions. You're not trapped in a slave box. I used to be a destination guy. I talked about it with Mosher on spot cost quite a bit. Back in the day I was destination. He was very journey oriented. For him. It was all about like, hey man, everything's a journey and you know, it's like the journey is the fucking fun and Blah Blah Blah. And I was like, no destination, get there. I just want to get to where we're supposed to be in the last few years. I flipped and now I am kind of like the journey is more important to me and know why that is. Why cause you're rich as fuck. Oh we did that too. But it's also you're successful. You don't have to worry about it anymore. Yeah, you're fucking Kevin Smith. He got 2 million friends on follow followers on Twitter. You can talk to them whenever you want to.

Speaker 4:          01:19:25       They want to come and see your movies. You're in this weird zone where you don't have to give a fuck anymore. Yeah. You know what it is. And I love the expression and I've it, but they said, uh, they said he doesn't, Kevin doesn't have to work for anyone anymore cause he works for the audience. And I was like, Oh God, that's perfect. It's true. That's it. If you could get to that place where it's not about like, fuck everyone, none of it. You don't rely on anybody for anything. It's all coming from within you, your camp or something like that. Not like there's no help. Of course you get help within your world, but do you know how comforting is it is to know that I don't have to do prep.
