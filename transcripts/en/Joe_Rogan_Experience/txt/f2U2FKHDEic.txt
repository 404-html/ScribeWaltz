Speaker 1:          00:00:00       As soon as we go. Lot five seconds now. Josh was just telling me about how he's going to start his own cult. Yeah, for sure. Absolutely. You know, uh, everything else, it seems like fucking work to me. So yeah, starting your own cult, if you could pull it off. The key is to not take it too far. Don't get too crazy, you know, I dunno if I have that ability though, man. I'm sitting here wearing, you know, black metal tee shirts and you know, listen to the crazy ass music. I think taking it too far is, it's kind of in my nature. You still driving the muscle car? Oh yeah. Every day, man. All about muscle cars. All Muscle car plus in this traffic still drives a manual. Yeah. That's Gangsta six speed. It sets your method number one method of transportation. If you're driving a man respect drive, a manual transmission, fucking Orange County.

Speaker 1:          00:00:46       You're still in Orange County? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I've been out of Orange County for a while. I was in downtown for a while and then, uh, and I live in Hollywood, like a vampire kind of also getting a lot of extra sparring and Hobos and knives and stuff like that. Oh, were you in like the bad area of downtown is there? Well, you know what, here's the thing about the bad area of downtown. It doesn't stay in the bad area of downtown. You know it, it's like, oh well this is a really nice, oh, we got a quaint little lofts and loud died. It's like, by the way, you see that schizophrenia crack head, he's going to fuck your shit up. You know, it's like Hancock Park, you know where Hancock Park is? Hancock quark is fucking amazing. It's like one of the most beautiful sexual urges.

Speaker 1:          00:01:28       But you can go two blocks down and you got gang graffiti, like, like two blocks down. You're in some sketchy area. Like as soon as you get out and you start going east further, like you get some fucking sketchy neighborhoods within a mile of these, like 1920s mentions of old Hollywood money mean those things are incredible. Right. And to me it's just like, wow, it's the most fantastic tourist guide ever. Like, Hey, come to la, you might get fucked or you might not sleep. Roll the dice. Let's see how this works out. Yeah. If you want to walk through downtown La, you could, you could take a wrong turn and a walking dead episode. You could be just strolling down seventh, everything's looking great. You're passing uh oh seven grand and Malo and all this stuff and then all of a sudden, Oh shit, where the hell am I?

Speaker 1:          00:02:18       That guy's got a tent, but I don't really think he's camping. He people who think that their downtown is fucked up, you don't even know what fucked up is. You need to see skid row like people don't see, I've shown people skid row and they go, that's not real. It looks fake as fuck. It looks like an episode of the walking dead. And the first time I drove through it and there was like some, and I'm seeing all these just people just, just milling about and it must have been later in the night, like not super late but getting to probably six or seven or it's because at some point there there's this mission or something down there and it's got this gated courtyard and at some point they close that gate and there was just people inside the courtyard and there were people outside of the courtyard that was his like clamoring to get into this thing and it was just insanity.

Speaker 1:          00:03:02       I go, fuck man, this is straight out of like some sort of dawn of the dead. If you get in by a certain amount of time, you're locking, you can stay in there. Yeah, I guess whatever. Shit. So like some people like they've got to get away from the crazy people on the street, I guess, or probably get some place to sleep and eat and what have you. You know, and you know, it's tell each other psalms. Isn't it weird that we look at people like Dan will go, yeah, you're, you're a loser. Like all you people, we're not going to help you change any of the, it's, it's easy to do that because to look at the situation on a, on a far more complex level, you know, looking for what all the issues that can write into this. I mean a majority of these people are probably mental health issues.

Speaker 1:          00:03:44       So there are crazy to simplify it and then they get into these, let's say drugs come into play or other things. I mean, they just, they need help, right? And there are some people there that may, maybe they are just total fucking down and outers that they just gave up on life in one way or another got hooked on something or hooked on something else. But I mean, at the end of the day, it's, it's too easy. It's much easier for people to just look at it as like, these guys are losers. There's loses of the system and where I'm some sort of a winner. But I mean they, in a way, some of these people were born losers. Then I guess because they didn't get to choose to be born with schizophrenia or any of these other sorts of things and have childhoods. There's a host of factors that plays in to someone being like that, but it's weird how we get to, someone gets to a certain age, like you're 35 you were homeless for a, sorry dude.

Speaker 1:          00:04:33       Can't help you. I feel like a 10 if you're 10 on the street, homeless will a call. Come on buddy. He's a little guy. Scammed. Yeah. Who's just, who's his parents left him and he didn't have any food and he's got a really cute newsboy cap. It just seems so scrappy, you know? I think I'd like to make him my sidekick and we're going to travel around the world with him everywhere. He's got a bag on the end of a stick. Yeah. Yeah. Look at that bindle man. He's been places. That was the move that they had. Here's this is re we're looking at video right now and what's the name of this video pulled up like skid row says homeless on skid row in Los Angeles, all in caps. And it's fucking crazy. It's a, a whole series of homemade tents at these people put together.

Speaker 1:          00:05:14       They've created these like little apartments, a little structures and they're on the street and there's, I mean this is a pretty good video of, it just shows you how weird it is, but it's way crazier at night. Well it's even this just shows you were just looking at one street. Yeah. And we're only looking at like a few structure. It's like a little square radius of streets that encapsulate this, this, this area. And you know, I mean some people are like, well, oh yeah, it's not really that dangerous. And I'm like, well, I guess it really depends on the person. I personally, I wouldn't stroll around down there. I feel like I'll be all right, but why increase my likelihood, you know, having some sort of issue, especially if somebody is literally crazy, it's, it's really not a matter of whether they're jerk or

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       whatever. It's just they're operating in unstable, irrational way. So there's no way to, uh, to negotiate that very negotiated, no way to even know if it's going to happen. Right. And when someone's completely bonkers, this some guy doing it on his bike through it, whoa, that dude's got skills. Let's get some bike skills. [inaudible] on the front of his bike, die death. See each egg. Oh, the bunny pegs in the front. So maybe he could have, he could pick up a guy. I grabbed one homeless dude. He put them on the front and then they can go like, well, the steering wheel. That's, is that an impressive, that handlebar thing he just did? That shit's incredible bark. Yeah. It's just, it's not incredible. I can't do it, but, but does that like a standard move, Josh Barnett? Uh, you know, I do know how to ride a bicycle.

Speaker 2:          00:06:43       Probably not to the level of this guy doing that. Flipping the bar around. That's fucking, that's pretty wild. It's a, it's like having a fidget spinner. This is, except if you fuck it up, you're falling down. You're just eating shit and losing teeth. Yeah. I don't ride bikes much like that. Bam. That shit's incredible. Camera edit too sure is. Wow. We, oh, that's pretty slick. Yeah. It's a, it's an interesting dynamic and then it's not a simple situation to solve either. Right. You know, it's like some people would would easily just look at it like, oh, I'll just get rid of them. It's like, well, you can't just do that with somebody. I mean, that's not the way you do it. Is there a way to reprogram someone? I think who, I forget who the quote was by some famous dude, Frederick Douglass, but he said it's a, it's much easier to raise good children and the repair broken men.

Speaker 2:          00:07:36       I can believe that. Yeah. You know, we have, it's, it's always harder to take a fighter with a bunch of bad habits and try to cure them of that or reestablish new good habits than it is to just start off teaching them something correct from the, from the fucking get go. Yeah. You always see that for whatever reason with kicking technique if kicking technique, like a lot of guys that come from bad backgrounds, they have a really hard time like maybe karate to Moy, Tai real hard time transitioning over. And like I would see it even in taekwondo guys that came from a karate background didn't understand the importance of raising the knee up above the hip. It's like when things got weird, they couldn't pick their knee up for certain kids and it, it also did, I guess it would depend a lot on that style of cutoff day.

Speaker 2:          00:08:16       So like one of my guys show her Yamamoto is a, he's a junior world champion and kilkee when he was the youngest ever to compete in the world open weight tournament at 18 years old. And, uh, and he was like 190 pounds when he did it. 180 and 18 years old. There's fighting holy shit. You know, like your glover test Sherra's and with guys like that. Yeah. To kilkee shit is crazy too. When you watch those guys punch full blast the body but kick to the head like not punching to the face. I don't know where that really came about necessarily, but yeah. Yeah. You can kick them full on in the face. Kneed him in the face. Crazy things like that. But don't, don't throw a punch to the face, but it's like his kicks are pretty awesome. The next level

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       of taekwondo, it's like taekwondo. They said you couldn't punch to the face but you could kick above the waist and calc. Shannon's like, how about we kick the legs too and elbow and elbow. And I'm like, okay. Yeah, it's better. It plus it doesn't get stopped as much even though taekwondo is supposed to be continuous. Uh, like Olympic style. Yeah. They clench or appoint get scored and the raffle kind of, well, you know, there's always these little breaks. It seemed to happen, you know? Yeah. It's, it's interesting because I always feel like for little kids, especially what's really good about taekwondo is a same thing that's really good about gymnastics and even like cheerleading control and flexibility and yeah, there's all kinds of readers, right? I think taekwondo can be really great for that as well. Yeah. I think a lot of, if you're going to do taekwondo or really any, a lot of these traditional martial arts, it really depends on that teacher that makes, that makes it or breaks it.

Speaker 1:          00:09:46       I mean, you could have like some old, uh, take you on like gnarly old Korean dude who was going to teach you how to punch to the face and throw people and all kinds of stuff, but maybe gear your competition training towards the rule set that's allowable, but, or you could just have some dude that just wants you to flip around and scream at your points, which is the most ridiculous almost up there with like flopping and soccer, like flopping and soccer's hit some new levels lately. People think they know that. I think it's hilarious as some good sent me one and the guy doesn't even get hit. The other guy like throws his hand back and it doesn't even come near him and the guy launches himself through the hair rising on the ground. I've never seen anything like it. What is it that, how, how does one graduate to that position?

Speaker 1:          00:10:31       You know, here I'm, I'm out here, I'm playing a sport at let's say the highest level and I'm competing against other incredible athletes and we train our asses off and we develop all these skill sets and we get so good at handling a ball with our feet. And not even for foot fetish stuff, but, but just to play this game, and I'm going to now concede in such, like completely destroy all the toughness, all the grid, all the work, all the, all the things that I've developed mentally to, to be able to run and kick and do all this stuff and build up all these wind sprints. And then I'm just going to see a guy swat his hand at me and then I'm a fling myself on the ground and screamed bloody murder. They w they flap like fish. I don't they flop around the ground and twist and writhing in agony there has, there's like a mental disconnect that has to happen like you must just like I'm going to bitch myself out right now.

Speaker 1:          00:11:24       I'm going to completely just destroyed every element of toughness within me. I think they're just willing to do anything to get some sort of an advantage and I don't know what, I don't understand soccer. I don't know the rules so I don't know what kind of an advantage you would get if you handle the shots penalty shot, so you would get like pretty close to the goal. Yeah, they get to, they get to take a shot on goal or something like that. Pretty sweet. It is. That's just too much persuade. I just couldn't do it. I think it's worth too much. I think what you got to do is if somebody does you,

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       if somebody like actually fouls you, that guy just gets removed and they bring in a new player. Like it seems pretty simple like this panel, they have reduced the uh, the element there and in terms of what, what the reward is, the risk or an hour, you see people flopping like penalize them 100%. Yeah. That guys for a year. Yeah. You're slowing the game down and you're making us look like shit. So stop. People are talking about you on podcast, Bro. That's not good. You have no idea what happened to that game without Mike. They came. I've been for the championship of the world between the two greatest teams of all time. I don't know about that. No, I just know that dude flopping around and we saw the Jamie flopped on this. Preflop get the fuck out of here. Did they call it flopping? Are we making that up? They call it flopping and soccer day. She called it taking a dive. Oh, interesting. Alright. Alright. Oh, oh no way. Oh my God.

Speaker 3:          00:12:48       A little bit.

Speaker 2:          00:12:50       That is hilarious.

Speaker 2:          00:12:53       Are you kidding? The Oh my God. Watch this one. That is hilarious. I'm so hurt. Oh God. And the guy standing right there. That's the thing. You know the ref has to adjust, which needed to grab. Did he grab you grabbed his right. Oh, now, now they flop out on his right. Did he land on his right knee? Okay. That guy might have blown his knee out. Hold on. Go back to the ref because the ref might have blown his knee out because I'm looking at the way he falls. Like washed. Not this guy. The next guy. That guy here washes. Oh no, he's standing around. Then he'd just, he leaps onto the ground one more time. Oh, and he starts grabbing his shin. No, I think he's grabbing his knee now. He might have his Shin Guard is fucking bullshit. I mean they have these guys just kind of flops out of the huddle. That's ridiculous. It's almost as if these guys are so tuned to any touch that once they feel it, they immediately just, they die. They fall down, they cry. If they're screaming

Speaker 4:          00:13:58       box, that's where you get the penalty shot and that can literally change the whole game.

Speaker 2:          00:14:01       Oh, oh. So people just fall down when they just fell on his own right next to him. Oh, so they just try to fall down and get hurt. Oh that's hilarious. So was that the guy just stopped and the other guy, we used him as like a tripping mechanism

Speaker 4:          00:14:15       because if you can get the right card, you can get a guy taken out of the game and then you're at a huge advantage for the rest of game. Like if you could manipulate it ref and the MMA fight, which you kind of can I suppose, but like you can't get the other guy's Dick cute all the time. There's definitely rules for that. And here you just got to trick a guy.

Speaker 2:          00:14:31       Did you see that? There's like a I understood of like, yeah, we're fucking with the game right now. We're pretending to be hurt all the time. This is Larry is, what is the name of this video?

Speaker 4:          00:14:41       It's like best flops or funny dives of 2017

Speaker 2:          00:14:44       2017 funny dives and simulations just this year. Oh, that's hilarious. We'll see. Some of them, they're exaggerating. This is not the best edit because some of these guys are just getting tripped. I mean, they're just falling like that guy's just falling like this is stupid. Edit. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:15:01       Is there also the best athletes of all time? Like the shit. I be just falling.

Speaker 2:          00:15:05       Oh, okay. I see what you're saying there. Yeah, but people fall, you know? I mean the other ones, there's so many of these that are like that. That shit is so ridiculous. Look, oh my God, I can't make it. I mean, that shit is so funny. It's like there's a culture of falling and pretending you're hurt.

Speaker 4:          00:15:22       There's a little, they could be, I mean, I don't know if they really are because it probably takes away from their stature as an athlete, but getting in these videos where you're just getting shown all over the Internet again.

Speaker 2:          00:15:31       Honestly, a couple of these were guys doing goofy stuff and then laughing about it as like ha, I guess it's just what we do. We pretend to be heard all the time. And so it's some sort of an accepted culture with, oh my God, I just falls down. It's accepted within the culture of playing the game. As much as I can understand now that guy taking a dive made sense cause he saw the other detail and all that. It's great. These guys just touched faces and then fell to the ground. Like they get hit with meteors. There's snipers out there just in the audience just picking them off left and right. They just fall down like in agony. Oh look at this guys. Like look at this guy just falling down. What do you do? What you're doing that thing. Stop doing that. God, it's a, they have to revamp the rules. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:16:22       Clip. They've uh, they started finding people that were doing it, but I think they sort of cut back on the fines. They tried to make it monetarily not a good thing to do.

Speaker 2:          00:16:30       I know Ian Edwards love soccer and I love Ian and he's trying to get me to do a soccer companion, but I feel like about soccer would I do about like speaking Latin? Like it's just some shit that's just leftover from a long ass time ago. It's currently code if we still remember how to do it. So he, we don't, we don't want to not know what Latin is and like how, what the word, we don't want to get so confused that we think this is like some forgotten languages, but uh, especially since it's within all of our scientific, uh, tax and all that. But it's nonsense, right? Yeah. That's nonsense. I would rather than Latin then learn how to flop out of fake injuries. I just, I don't know about that. But you respect a, an actual skillful soccer player. Those guys are awesome athletes.

Speaker 2:          00:17:13       Actually. What, what, what, what makes it so a disappointing is that I know how good those dudes are. I know that they must be super talented and great, very skillful and in great shape to then take to get yourself to that level to let's say, elite level at your sport, at your skillset. Jimmy Aldo. Who? Josie. Josie. Aldo. Play soccer. Oh, I'm not surprised. Amazing. Yeah, I bet. Like professional level. Do you think he would flop? Nope. I cannot see that happening. I don't think so. That's probably what held him back. It's too busy throwing low kicks

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       at the, instead of, instead of kicking the ball, he's just chopping people's legs out from under him.

Speaker 2:          00:17:53       Yeah. There's some video of him playing and moving around and he's fucking really good. Which, where's Aldo? That ball? That was him doing the ball flip. Oh yeah. Yeah. Watch this. Look at that. We're really, that's one of the best players in the world. He did it against Neymar. Now do you think they're just playing and having a good time as a charity match? Right. Just sticking around but still look at this. I don't think he's just like, okay guys, like, look, ain't running for real, dude. I have actual games to play. I'm not blowing out my acl, like trying not to get pumped by an MMA fighter. Right, exactly. It's like, okay, you can have this moment, but I've seen videos of him practicing and playing. He's like, like a real professional soccer player you're looking at and be like, wow. Yeah. It didn't surprise me in the least I was that Jose. Yeah. He, he goes, hey, just he's kicking three pointers in where he's trying at least,

Speaker 1:          00:18:46       hey, uh, I would never happen for me. Never. I played like little intermural soccer and college for a second, which just like these pickup games with all the international kids. I just thought it'd be a good way to get in shape. I didn't know really much about playing soccer, so he too big a, I don't know if there's really a too big around that much. Well there's also that not good enough. There's that, that part too, when these, when these dudes from like Scotland and Argentina and all over who would play like all their like triple a leagues and stuff and I mean I'm out there playing defense and I could hustle. I had quick feet and I wasn't movable so that was kinda good. But uh, you know, at one point, uh, they see my team kept trying to get it. I get an opportunity for me to score on goal and I'm like, no, no, quit. You know, I got good enough to dribble and pass it away a little bit. Don't fucking ask me to kick this thing is never going to go where I want it to and it's just careening off everywhere. It plus this dude from Argentina was just all over me every single time. I'm like, everyone else is like, oh, it'd be funny if he could be great if he could get a shot and this guy like fuck fat, I'm going to fucking, I'm on. I'm like stink on shit. Am I wrong?

Speaker 2:          00:19:52       Taking it, there's like a build that would excel at football, which you think so? I could think so. And then I would think that soccer would require, because you run so much. I would think tall and lanky would be good for soccer or even maybe just a long leg. Short torso. Yeah. But that messy guys are like really small. Right. That's just like super fast. Just being very quick. Yeah. It's been very quick and very agile and being able, but I was just thinking tall cause then you could more headers, more body up, up top. Let me ask you this. As a proponent of violence, why? How come rugby never took off here? That seems to me to be the real sport.

Speaker 1:          00:20:28       Ah. You know, I don't really know why. I think because American football is American football. Maybe. Maybe that's why

Speaker 2:          00:20:37       seems kind of stupid in a way. Because you have a helmet on pads and you're running into each other and we already know that that's not a good idea. It isn't. It actually makes it way worse.

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       Right. You can let harder. They've figured out some new technology, which I know they're working on some packed resist in helmets and things that which that kind of changes everything. If they do that and they get it to the point where guys can collide heads and actually be okay. I don't know. I don't really think that I just there they can get these, these helmets that are going to take the impact, uh, and reduce it and all that. But I just, once you're a 300 pound dude running a four, seven smashing into, uh, another 300 pound, dude, I just don't, you know, it's just like I would get in the arguments with the, uh, with like these kids that, uh, at the University of Montana rugby team, like, he should come and play rugby. You should play rugby. I'm like, no, I want to fight.

Speaker 1:          00:21:28       And you know, rugby that seems fun and all that, but, and well, it's, did you play football? Yeah, I played football all these way tougher. I go, AH, hold on. Uh, you, the pool you're drawing from, I'm sure there's some good athletes. The pool we were drawing from when I'm going to University of Washington football camp and when I'm playing against, you know, nationally ranked teams like, Oh, day you, this is different. Yeah. We're, who they're drawn from is a much, much bigger pool. The stakes for them are much, much bigger than you and your college team floating around and then drinking beers after your games. This is not like that. This is a different story. You especially someone that has a potential nfl career and they'll like super focused. You know, if you look at the some of the super athletes that you get that entered the nfl to that just the sheer size and speed that these guys have and it's only so much that can be genetics.

Speaker 1:          00:22:19       You've got like some serious training involvement and dedication. Like they know how much money's involved. Exactly. And there are people that are grooming these athletes from a super young age to to meet these requirements and so I was like, look, rugby is super awesome. It's tough. It's a great sport. I like Rugby League way better than rugby union cause unions got all the scrumming and all that. It slows it down. It's League is seven tackles. I believe. That's all you get. You got to tell you get, but you, you, it's constant. You're constantly moving up the field. What if you go more than seven? Like what did you don't? Once you hit seven, you have to drop the ball and then they change is over. But it moves super fast and it's very aggressive and it's just, you know, con it's like watching people play wishbone the whole time.

Speaker 1:          00:23:03       They just constantly taking each other down. Yeah. And so, you know, they're hitting, boom, this tackle happens. Then they're going to try and shuttle the ball back to their other teammate and then shovel shoved the ball down the line again and keep it moving until they can finally break through watching the other one. To me it slows down way too much. So I don't really enjoy it. Which, you know, that's Kinda how the argument with American football is that it slows down. And to me, I'm like American football, I was like watching two armies go at it. You set, you have your, your, your skirmish, you regroup, you skirmish again, you regroup, you skirmish again. And by the end of the, all these skirmishes, the war is either is won or lost by this team. Yeah. That's the way I look at it. But, uh, well, you know, that was, it was designed to sort of placate people.

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       What, that's all games are designed to be a diminishing aspect of war. But American football in particular was actually literally like systematically designed, like we know the time that it happened. There's a whole radio lab podcast. Okay. It's pretty fascinating, man. And about how they ran into problems when they let American Indians play with white kids. Oh yeah. The natives are just fucking all the white kids up. That's a brutal last games and natives did some gnarly shit. Did they eat their hearts? That kind of part of the problem. I don't know what the problem was, but uh, it was an issue. That was it. Again, it was an issue. I would, I would have loved, you know, Steve Rinella on recently and he was talking about the guys who killed custer and little big horn and one of these guys were just this massive guy.

Speaker 2:          00:24:29       What does the name mall is that they called them gall gall and he went on to a wild wheels. He was the Conan book. Right. Is there, that'd be how cold a conquer. Yeah. Take it out. Right. But this guy was apparently just massive and I mean, I would've loved to have seen that with my own eyes. Like would it looks like to be like a direct lineage of warrior culture? Like if that guy was living in the 18 hundreds, like he is directly from the original native Americans that came here from Siberia, you know, whatever. Thousands and thousands of years ago, that would be something, fuck yeah. Uh, chief Seattle, which my fucking phone don't work. Fuck it. Uh, he had some quote about being at a football game at the University of Washington. He was, and I can't for the life of me remember exactly how it goes, but it was just like, oh, it's not a lot of white men fight each other today.

Speaker 2:          00:25:21       I don't know why the hell you guys are into this, but whatever. Yeah, they didn't really have like, like that kind of a game. There's something uniquely brutal about American football. There is. Oh, and I look at rugby, I'm like, okay, that to me seems more realistic. It is more realistic. I think in some ways, um, I, it's, it's even, it's more brutal in some and less than others. Like I came in May versus maybe kickboxing. Yeah. Well, and the thing is at one of my arguments with the rugby kids is like, dude, you, you don't get hit as hard as you do in American football as you're doing here in rugby. You just, you're, you're not, um, plus the athletes are smaller and you know, go do a kickoff. Guys, they talk about fucking insane. But what would you think would happen if like what if by some crazy reason people decided, hey look, we're going to no longer do American football.

Speaker 2:          00:26:13       We're going to do rugby, rugby league, which is open to regulate. I don't totally understand the difference between the two of them. I'd have to watch a few games I guess. But those guys who dominate and football, wouldn't you think they would be the guys who dominate in rugby? Yeah, I do. Everybody would just get bigger and faster and stronger. Yup. We'd be just like American level football players pretty much because the, the, if, if we're talking that everybody would switch over to rugby, that means all these rugby teams in the league and all that would then be the ones with all the big deals in the TV

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       deals and all the, all the money would funnel into it and therefore the potential prosperity of it would drive the interest for people to try and apply there. Where's it being not only a part of that hero myth that would come with being a champion football team player, you know, our rugby team player, but also with the hero myth of just being a part of that within, you know, your normal society or of this elite exemption, exceptional status, this thing that stands alone that it seems a bit foreign to your normal person, but also the money and the success that comes from that kind of notoriety and the doors that it opens in terms of, um, you know, to use a overused word, the privilege of being at that level, at, within that inner circle of exceptional or seen as exceptional people. Anyways. Do you think?

Speaker 1:          00:27:39       What's the short drive? It you've had a long career in mma, long successful career, but it's very rare. It's very rare for someone to be operating the same level that you're at seven years is the cutoff. Like once you get to about seven, everything starts to just rapidly decline. Like he'd just fall to shit. Do you think it's an injury thing? Is it a training thing? Is it just a life thing? They didn't, they didn't, uh, or at least they weren't able to single out any particular factor in, in general. But you know, there was a lot of theories as to why that might be, but they were able to track professional fighters, careers, uh, over length of time. I think they had some metro having, I don't remember, but it's on the, it's on the Internet. Uh, it, uh, I do believe that they have counted, they were able to account for a number of fights too and weigh that against that metric and see how that may influence things.

Speaker 1:          00:28:33       But seven years was this magic number, like six, seven years. And once you start going over seven years, your, your, your percentage of success started just crumbling. Like it was dramatic about how a guy would be like 13 and three and he'd get to seven years and all of a sudden it's like 13, six, 13, seven, 13. He just starts losing just about everything. Yeah. Bj Penn's good example of that. Right. You know, like there's certain, there's a certain drop off where the person just looks totally different and, and you know, we could honestly look, it would be, we would have to isolate a lot of different factors to figure out any one particular thing. But there's so many elements that go into being a professional fighter and being successful at that. And so for let's say we'll take Bj, you know, maybe, maybe it is physicality, maybe he's lost a little bit of a step.

Speaker 1:          00:29:20       His reactions are a little slower, uh, through any number of reasons why maybe his, his strength has diminished maybe slightly or it's flexibility, maybe certain physical elements regardless of injury or not have diminished enough that at where they used to be. It was an edge where it is now is evened out or is or is below what is necessary for him and how he fights to be successful. Uh, maybe could be beyond physical deterioration. Maybe it's just mental, uh, elevation. Yeah, exactly. So maybe he's just not as motivated to push in the same ways that he was or maybe he's not able to, uh, I don't know, recognize, uh, things that he was five years ago, six years ago, and seeing those opportunities and being able to react on them quicker. Uh, there's a number of things and especially when it comes to mental now, now you're getting into such a subjective area that, you know, go, go, pull that apart.

Speaker 1:          00:30:21       Yeah, that's a really good point. The mental aspect is a really good point because who knows, you know, the only, only the person that's competing knows, we really never have any idea how, what's going on inside a person's head. I mean, for me, I decided to take a break after my Arlovski fight and that was somewhat physically based, but most of it was mental. I, uh, I just didn't, I had no interest to go into any kind of training camp to put myself through all that again to then to fight again. You know, it's just for one when you start off fighting and what those goals are too, as you get further in and further in and further in and, you know, getting it 20 years of being a professional fighter and being a top 10 heavyweight and arguably and top five most of the time for Shit, 16 of them, something like that and high level competition and uh, it's just, and youngest ever UFC heavyweight champion.

Speaker 1:          00:31:18       That's right. That was until that, that son of a bitch, Jon Jones came and beat me out by a few months. That talented bastard. Now you're the youngest ever. Yeah, just heavyweight champion instead of the youngest ever UFC champion. But, um, it's, it got to a point where it's just like, well, you know, my reasons for fighting are essentially still the same, but all, I don't have the same motivation to go out there and be like, oh, I'm going to conquer the whole world. I'm fight. I can beat that guy. Could be, I know I could beat guys. Like it doesn't, I don't, I'm not trying to prove it to myself anymore, you know, but that fire that wants to fight still exist. Just like, well, you know what, I'm going to take some time to work on some of the other stuff that is going to be more of my life after this because fighting is going to end sooner than this stuff is.

Speaker 1:          00:32:07       How old are you now? 39. Now when you think about, do you have like a number in your head? Like when I hit 42 or, no, no, no, no. I don't, I don't have anything set like that. I just figured that if I'm being honest with myself and self aware, the, I'll know when that time has come, when that, that moment is, is getting to that, that edge where if you keep going, it's gonna fucking it's going to go downhill versus okay, you've got right to that point. Call it fucking good. Move on. And there's still athletic windows open to me with grappling and maybe a few other in professional wrestling. Uh, but, uh, fighting is going to be a much shorter window and the fact that I've got 20 years out of it or however long that I take this to is going to be pretty phenomenal.

Speaker 1:          00:32:56       Yeah, it's pretty incredible. Are you thinking about doing some more grappling? Yeah. Yeah. I mean I've been approached by a few things but uh, either dollar wise just to really hasn't made sense or mainly that's just it and uh, I feel like it's just one thing that people have to figure out as super popular and get it until, or super exciting rather than give it on television. So many watches like your match with Dean lister, you know, you're the first guy to tap out dean lister and how many years? Like 17 years or 15 years. Something crazy. And you caught them a scarf hold. Oh yeah, it had an arm boom. Judo style. Yeah, it's fucking bad ass. Here's the thing, I had seen that the last time you'd been subbed. Was that really? Yeah. So I already knew that and I'm like, well, I'm going to put this in my back pocket if I need it later on in the match.

Speaker 1:          00:33:39       And after I've been riding him and grinding on him and beating on him. Once he's huffing and puffing, I can get it. I know it's going to be real hard for him to stop this. And so sure enough, I look up and it's like, oh shit, I don't have a lot of time left. Boom, hit it. Go. And it worked. Yeah. And then he run, gracie was a big feather in your cap to because he, ron is what, one of the most respected young Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt guys out there. Like he's super respected. His and defensively like re very tough defensively, didn't, couldn't tap him. Uh, he all those guys like here on Hallock, uh, Henner they were all very successful when they were competitors and I know people want it. Yeah, they were, they were kicking butt a fact. What was it? Henner tapped Jeff Munson back in the day.

Speaker 1:          00:34:27       I think it was a quick triangle. So, uh, when here on was the only guy that how it could get to step up and wrestle me. That was, that was the option. There was all these heavyweights and all these dudes and I'm like, I found a bunch of guys that had, I had recently competed and won belts and stuff or one tournament like, Hey, pick, what about that guy? Now he's like, he won't do it back. I won't do it. That guy won't do it the whole bunch from, I'd be like, well they won't do it without the G. And I'm like, okay, well that's, you know, that's not an option. So why even bring it up? See that black dude, really high level Brazilian Jujitsu world champion guy who wanted to get in there with you. There have been, but well no. Well there are a few like cyborg wanted to do it, you know, but then that's an interesting one guy.

Speaker 1:          00:35:05       He got interested, he got injured and so then it was like, well how do we fill that gap? What kind of injury do you have? Do you know? Rib, I think. I didn't really look into it too much for me. It was just a matter of that matches and happening. Right. Move on, you know, try to salvage this thing. And so I like to see that match though in the future. That would, I think there'll be really interesting. I could happen. It could happen. I trained for it. I felt real confident going into it. I really wanted it to, because everybody was like, as soon as I beat Dean, well the first thing was, oh, what an idiot. He's wearing shoes. Oh, that's a dumb is saying he's going to get his leg tore off. What? How he's so dumb. And then I went, it's like, what a cheater.

Speaker 1:          00:35:41       He wore his shoes, gave him such an advantage. He had so much grip. Oh, that's bullshit. It's like, which is it? Oh, he was to 70 and dean was 185 pounds. Like, what are you talking about? I was like two 50 and dean was like two 30 the guy was a big massive, and people forget he, he's pretty thick dude. I remember giving him a hug at the quote unquote way. I mean, we didn't weigh in and I'm like, Ooh, this dude is silverbacks status right now. He's huge. Yeah. He's a fucking massive guy. He's strong and talented too. And so I'm like extremely technical, very. And you know to, to me, I'm seeing all the blue belts going nuts out there and I'm like, well, he's a, he was a heavyweight too, so I didn't just go out there and outsize him. You know, I used my game on him and yeah, I wrote him heavy.

Speaker 1:          00:36:32       You know, butch is a skill to develop, but um, you know, you don't see dean making excuses. I mean we just went out there and gave it our best and I was able to beat him that day. Well deems one of the best leg lockers in the country. Yeah, I mean really it's like super knowledgeable and when it comes to any aspect of Jujitsu, but in particular leg locks. And he spent a bunch of Tom on the east coast at Henzel his place. And Eddie Bravo said that's sort of where hens, those place became like this leg lock Mecca. You think of like Gary, Tony, planet teens and John Donahoe like, yeah, his, his like what teachings that he lent in over there sort of spread. And now they've, since Donna her was a real wizard since spread it into his own sort of ideas and philosophies on a task.

Speaker 1:          00:37:15       That's the thing. You just never know what can come of, of any, even the smallest to largest influence allowing that that seed can take place anywhere, but someone may tend to that garden and all of a sudden boom, you know, a big export, a big expansion from that idea can come from it. And that's, you know, one of the great things it was, that's one of the things that people like about you is that you're, you, most of the time you're going old school. I mean, you're doing catch wrestling stuff. I mean, you're doing like the shit that Karl gotch and all those dudes from those uh, old school wrestling catch wrestling books. Like a lot of those submissions, you're proven those things to be 100% legit. Yes. And I, you know, I understood, I understand completely the, some of the incredulousness about looking at that and being like, that doesn't fucking work because you think, well, if it did it would be everywhere.

Speaker 1:          00:38:08       But for one it's just there's just not enough people teaching it. So that's really diminishes the ability to expand it. Although like myself and, uh, all the people from the Japanese shoot wrestling side that that has come from like Sakharova and my Fujiwara. I mean there's nothing that people, we explained that connection cause it's really kind of fascinating that who will, who went over there was it, it's called [inaudible] Antonio Gnocchi to create the new Japan pro wrestling Dojo and teach all of his student all, all of the wrestlers, how to be catch wrestlers and to give them a foundation and basically shooting, which is real fighting. So then they could go out there and work these matches, but keep the intensity, the realism, uh, the, it's like the difference between, and I know you're not the biggest fan of professional wrestling. How dare, how dare you, I dare, I dare if I had a gauntlet, I would throw it.

Speaker 1:          00:39:05       I'm sure there's a gauntlet in here somewhere. Look at this fucking place. Yeah. Uh, but, uh, you know, I also understand some of the gripe with looking at like where the way wrestling has been for quite a while now. It's like, oh, so it got outed, right? So everybody knows it's worked. So people operate on this premise that it's fake. So whatever, like why bother? Make it real anymore. Let's just fake it up all the way. And then people would open up skills and it would be like if, if, uh, if all magicians were just like, hey, look, all of our tricks, they're not real. They're not real magic. Here's how you do them all. And then I'm going to open up schools and just teach everyone, you know, just pay me 500 bucks for three months. And now you too can be a magician.

Speaker 1:          00:39:45       And it's just like, well, uh Oh man, that would ruin going to magic shows. It would just make it so shitty. But you know, that's how a lot of these, these guys get into wrestling now. That would never be restless. Like to be a wrestler back even in say the 70s, early eighties, you had to be a fucking tough guy. Like dusty roads. You look at him and you're like, that guy is not tough. You're like, no, actually he was recruited by the fucking Miami Dolphins and he was like, ah, I think I can make more money being arrested then I can be in a football player back then. You know, or ric flair was like a all American or college, Big Time College football player. And he went and trained under a vern Ganja and uh, Billy Robinson at the, at this barn out in Minnesota somewhere. And they would have to run miles and lift weights and do squats and wrestle each other for real.

Speaker 1:          00:40:37       And it's just like all these dudes, you think it's like, oh yeah, Woo. And all that. These motherfuckers had to go through some real shit and they had to prove themselves to be legitimately tough enough to be even a professional wrestler to work matches and they used to hold do things like hold tryouts and people would come down, they paying their money. Then these wrestlers would just run them into the ground and then all right, whoever's left, whoever could get through the endurance part of this, okay now you're going to get in the ring with some dude and then they would just get the shit tortured out of them. The APP, you know, just totally ripped apart and then like, all right, cool bye. He didn't make it because that's just the way it was. You couldn't become worked right cause it used to be, it was one point in time. It was like they would do like pro matches in 30 intervals, maybe their thirties like a farmer Burns' date. Right, exactly. So originally professional wrestling catch catch as catch can was 100% real like these guys, this is how people would travel the world. This is how midsole my Ada that you Doka Jiujitsu guy ended up in Brazil

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       doing catch wrestling pro wrestling matches and then ended up staying in teaching judo and Jujitsu and catch wrestling through the gracies, the, the actual birth of Brazilian Jujitsu, which is amazing because you could trace it. Yes. It started as catch, catch the started judo and catch wrestling and can we pull up because of it burns hanging himself. Oh yeah. The hang mantric. Yeah. He used to, his neck was so strong that he would do this trick where he would put a noose around his neck and drop and hang from his men and support his, and he was probably about 170 pounds. I'm like, oh, something like that. Yeah. And it would hang from his neck and not die. Yes. Which most of us. How do you even get to that point? How do you test that theory? Do you like ease into it? To think that just an off ever while I was doing it.

Speaker 2:          00:42:14       I hope so. What a wasted opportunity. Maybe David Carradine. Chill guys to fucking hang himself. Go. Go to the one where you see his full body, the far left there. Yeah, look at that. I mean the guy had a neck that was so fucking strong. He literally could hang himself. I mean he had his hands free so it could reach up and grab the rope I guess. But uh, I mean I wonder how long you would survive doing that. I Dunno. I could make it hard to, uh, to give him a blowjob afterwards. Yeah, for sure. There's certain dudes that like, you look at them today and you don't think of them as being like 20 inch neck on 165 pounds. It's amazing. I mean, any whistles? Yankee doodle. Oh Jesus Christ muscles. Yankee doodle. While we can be dropped from six feet, what, what, what?

Speaker 2:          00:43:05       Drop from six feet. So it probably wasn't even six feet tall. So he's dropping it from his own height and catching with his fucking neck and then he whistles. Yeah. Is a gay for pay pro body builders as well as maybe mel prostitute. Hey, gay for pay. Hey, what are those little things that they put on CNN? Stuff like that, like miracle weight loss cure, and then you go pay dad. Like what does, what do you have these paid ads? That's ridiculous. Yeah. I leave what she looks like today. And you're like, what the fuck is this? So you're running that through a CNN through like an accredited news website. Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is the kind of stuff that people did in the late 1900 for fun because there wasn't anything like TV. No Internet. So what do you do? You end up hanging yourself from seeing if he could drop from six feet.

Speaker 2:          00:43:52       I wonder how many people tried to emulate that and it just didn't work out. Talk about Darwinism. Oh, there had to be a lot, right? Yeah, for sure. Is there's gotta be some dummies like, argh. Fuck up. Snap. Yeah. Oh, for sure. Oh Man. There was a lot that died because there wasn't a whole lot of entertainment back then. It was either that or get dysentery. There's a crazy story going around. Some youtube couple did, some stunt where the other girl shot the guy, right? Yeah. Yeah. And killed him. Oh, pt. It was thick enough to stop a bullet style. And what kind of a round was it? Cause uh, a nine millimeter. Even a low, not, not, not like a, not a hot load. One

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       hot mode. Uh, not even a real, like a site, like a personal defense round or whatever it will pierce phone books. No, no problem. Yeah. I don't know what the fuck they were thinking. Can you imagine just having trust and encyclopedias? Well, up a bullet. They even test that out. They put an encyclopedia on the ground and shoot at first at this crazy bitch probably. She probably put some Kevlar and a book and said, look of even in the littlest buck will stop a bullet. And then she gave him the book with no Kev warm plan. Well, I don't really believe that folks. This is just a joke. Don't sue me. Women, women and men, man, they can, they figure out how to ways to be tricky all the time or stupid. It's fuck. They figured you're dumb as fuck. There's a lot of dumb as fuck out there.

Speaker 1:          00:45:11       It's just a matter of whether or not you can survive it. Dude, I've been trolling the past a day on instagram putting up these barriers. Thoughts about bears? Yeah. So many people think I'm serious, dude. I wrote about forest rangers infiltrating bear. I saw it. I read that. And he'll try to find there too. People are so fucking stupid. It's like what we were talking about before the podcast started about apple, the forum cults and Right Tology Oh, Ron Hubbard and all that shit. Oh, it's this the diminishing element of have of critical thinking. It's not just about the reduction of critical thinking in today's society. It is the effort that it takes to be a critical thinker. And four, I would classify it under this, under the, this, this concept I have that I've been working with called the human entropy. So entropy is the, the in physics, it's um, things returning, simply put, it's things going to their load, a state of energy and human beings, human entropy will go to their lowest date of energy, given an opportunity.

Speaker 1:          00:46:10       And to the point where you see wally, if you've seen that movie and all that, the big fat out, just gnarly people just floating around on hover beds being fed and taken care of and having zero strife in their life that we will do that if given the opportunity. And so not having to think critically, finding a group identity of some sort, even as crazy as a cult or which I would argue that there's a lot of ideologies around nowadays that are just as cult-like is as scientology or you know, heaven's gates, stuff like that helps a lot of people so out of line, uh, but, uh, um, to, to be, to belong in one of these groups, to be a part of that identity means that you no longer have to take as much responsibility for your own actions because this group has decided your, your value system, how you're going to operate your ethics.

Speaker 1:          00:47:08       It also, I mean there's, um, some philosophical arguments that part of that also ultimately stems from, I think it was from Ernest Becker. It stems from fear of death and having to mitigate the anxiety and nihilism that could come with confronting and accepting the fact that you're going to die and everything that you did is going to die with you, essentially. Like your, your lack of existence is coming around the corner. Not If you put on the purple Nike's and cut your balls off. Wait for the comment. That's right. You drink the Koolaid. Did you hear how the, the guy, uh, he saw everybody dying horribly and he's like, Jonestown, yeah, we'll fuck. I'm not going to drink that. Please. You know, do something else. Instead it's like, shoot me, I don't want to, I don't want to take the drink. I'm sure it didn't they kill like 900 people or something like that.

Speaker 1:          00:47:56       Yeah. Town something saying all of those lines. Yeah. Yeah. It's just, it's very interesting watching people just given to the influence of the hive. Of course, whatever hive that is, whether it's a religious hive or I'm fast and operates on the same principles, you know, whether it be religion and you can tell people, of course, to me religion is kind of one of the ultimate ones because the, everything we do has, is, is measured against a wager. You know, if we talk from, from games. So what, what's at stake and cruises, the importance or the of, of the game itself. So, you know, fighting increases that, that threshold and so much higher because the more greater potential for death or hurt pain, whatever, right? You're fighting somebody and as you go down the lines, but you know, poker is, is popular because the raised stakes, the money as at play and the reward that could come with it and the potential that you could lose from it.

Speaker 1:          00:48:56       So everything has this, this and value. There's this measure against what you're, what you're potentially giving up. And what's it, what's it hazard. So with religion, what's it hazard, your eternal soul, something that is so high value that you can't, oh fuck, I can't risk that. So fuck, I guess I better, you know, I mean it's, that's why it's so powerful, but also it is, it is a panacea for death because like Nicha we'll talk about the concept of true world values. This is not the true world. This other thing is the true world. So all of this suffering and strife and difficulty and any like bullshit that happens to me, all of this, in the end, it really isn't gonna matter because eventually I'm going to go to this true world and this is the real world. And this is the, my payoff for all of the, all the Shit I had to go through down here.

Speaker 1:          00:49:54       And so for a lot of people, the concept of having meaning for their difficulty, for their struggle is absolutely important because otherwise, why am I doing this? You know, to take your own existence, your own being in the world and take it on to yourself and have all your own accountability and look at it as I'm here living the best life I can because I need to live the best life I can because it's the only life I will ever live. Yeah. That is a lot of weight. And you know, um, the anxiety of people dealing with that, trying to really take that on face on with death and their, their, their lack of permanence in this world. Uh, that's the, the argument is that was where nihilism can come from. And then with nihilism, it's like, well, nothing matters. So if nothing matters and you're not, you're not able to, to operate anymore, you're just like, what's the point?

Speaker 1:          00:50:52       The moment matters though. Of course, it does all of it. Everything matters. Well, it see, it's up to, you do assign your values as to what you're doing anyways and why you're doing it. Um, but again, that involves taking responsibility for those values and caring those, that burden of what that may be on your own shoulders and not somebody who was one of the reasons why learning some kind of a discipline at an early age. It's probably like really important for people. I think. So. I mean, I think for me a lot of it came from being ostracized as a kid and being someone that was not of hive mentality and out of herd mentality and that you get ostracized. For what? Because of what? Just, uh, for, for one it was being bigger and for all the things that I was interested in, all the dorky stuff or weird stuff or played dungeons and dragons, I would, if I had the time I play dungeons and dragons, I would play warhammer 40 k I would, I still play magic the gathering from time to time. Oh yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:51:48       Fuck yeah. Are you kidding me? I tap that man a motherfucker. Ooh, I love it. Yeah. But, uh, you know, for being into that kind of stuff, but also just for being, just for, just being different. And some of it was like big brother syndrome stuff. So it's like, oh well you fuck with big brother because it's fun. And eventually he gets mad and he finds you and he beat you up and you cry and you know, but you do it again the next day. Anyways. So for me it's like, oh, here's this big kid and he's going to get upset if you start fucking with them. Uh, and it's funny, Haha until I get ahold of you. And then it's like, oh, you just beat me up. That's fucked up. And I said, well I didn't, I didn't want to beat anybody up until you started fucking ridiculing me in the first place.

Speaker 1:          00:52:29       So, but when you're a little child, you don't understand regulation of emotions as well. You also don't understand the social parameters in which all this stuff is functioning anyways. You just don't have that kind of insight. And so, you know, it'd be like nowadays someone could walk in here and be like, fuck you, you suck. And I look at him and I would laugh about it because we were talking about this yesterday. I was saying that I saw it happen. Chocolate, Dell. I have saw people try to pick fights with chocolate dell and it's hilarious. It's like, yeah, why are you fucking suicidal? No, no, no, no, I have not. I've never had anyone really try to pick a fight with me. I had a guy at a, at a concert once, I get all, get all butthurt about me not letting him pass in between me and this, this girl that was standing with me, cause people kept trying to cut through to get it was at anthrax and he wanted to get, and I'm just like, fuck this.

Speaker 1:          00:53:14       Why do people keep trying to walk between us? Like Jesus just go around, right? So eventually I'm like, no, I'm not letting anybody by. So I got my elbows out and people would bump into it and then go, go around. Well this guy, he just kept going, kept tap in. It's just like, man, fuck you dude. I'm standing here with a girl. Go Away. He was trying to give a treat and you and your girl. And so eventually you can get like a Dick Rub. Like, uh, maybe, I mean, if he'd asked nicely, maybe he would've got one. Well, I don't know, that's a bold ask. But you know what though? Fortune favors the bold and I'm a kind human being. Maybe he didn't want me to rub his dick, but that's what he have got. You would've got that to give and you take sir. So, uh, the guy comes around and he finally goes around us and then he's just, he looks at me, he's like, hey man, I was trying to get through.

Speaker 1:          00:53:56       And I go, look, I'm standing here with this girl. Like, yeah, go somewhat. You just go around and he's getting all, he's getting pissed about it cause I'm dismissing him, you know? So eventually I was like, just, you know, let's go, let's walk away now that gets his fucking hackles up and he's all mad and he's, he's looking at me, he's like, you, this and that. And I started laughing at him. I go like, Oh, you want to, you want to scrap because you can't get through here. Is that, is that it is, this is what you want to do. And he's just like, Wah, Wah. And I go, okay, okay, we'll just move on. Oh, fucking chest up even bigger. And it's just like, he looks like he's going to walk away, whatever I'm saying, all right, you know? Okay, do your own thing.

Speaker 1:          00:54:31       He's like, Ooh, he's just getting even more looked up. And he points his finger out and I'm laughing at him. And the girl who, uh, who was, uh, does Jujitsu and was a fighter, she reaches out and grabs the whole disguise risks and pulls his hand out. And she's like, don't you don't want to do that? And then he looks at her and he looks at me and I'm just smiling and he pulls his hand back and I go, I know what must have gone through his head is just like, this girl's grip is serious. And she's telling me, don't fucking do it. It's probably a good idea not to fucking do it, probably. Exactly what, but other times there have been like, uh, you know, I'm not impervious to getting in a mood. And so sometimes I've been out and about and someone was being a dickhead.

Speaker 1:          00:55:12       And I see it and it's like, okay, this guy is, he's, he's clearly trying to egg something on somehow. And so maybe I, you know, add a little something to that scene to feel if he'll, uh, he'll bite and just happen, you know, or I've had some people go, oh yeah, of course. No one's going to fight you then know who you are. I'm like, are you fucking kidding me? I'm some sort of deal celebrity. Nobody knows who the fuck I am. So get away with a lot. And the thing is, if a guy who had a fight, who would know who you are, if a was a fan of fighting, he would know who you are. And those guys would be way less likely to pick a fight in the first, there was one dude who was at this bar and Fullerton, and he's being just belligerent.

Speaker 1:          00:55:49       He's being an asshole and this place and, and my buddy hammer, he was the door guy at the time and the southern and they're like, come on. And he's, this guy's fucking getting all riled up. And I'm standing there with hammer and just looking at this dude. And eventually the other tour guy comes over and he's like, hey, you fucking dumb ass. You're wearing the fucking tee shirt of that guy right there. So maybe you might want to shut the fuck up. It's this guy's wearing one of my affliction shirts. And the guy looks at the shirt and he looks at me and he was like, Oh shit, this is stupid. Getting your ass kicked. Because you picked a fight with a guy whose shirt you have on like you, you are, you're wearing a Josh Barnett shirt and you don't know who Josh Barnett is. Well, and some, a lot, a lot of this shit comes from people putting themselves into situations where they have upped the ante to wear for them not to follow through.

Speaker 1:          00:56:42       Is, is going to bring about like a, a huge internal conflict with them. You know, they're going to know that they raised the stakes and then they had to back down, which I think is really hard for just about anybody to deal with, to get yourself to a point where you're like, yeah, you know, I'm in the right. And then to, to dial that back. I mean, people don't even want to really apologize for anything, let alone have to admit that they took something too far. It got to a point where they weren't willing to go any further and they realize they fucked up and then to fuck and Tuck, Tuck tail and leave again and back down. And there's a lot of insecurity involved in that. There was a lot of insecurity probably to get it at that point in the first place, which is why people that really know how to fight don't have to go out there and try to prove to somebody else that, that they are capable or that look at, hey everybody, look at how, how bad ass I am.

Speaker 1:          00:57:33       So you know, when it was like for me, I just, I don't start fights, you know? I mean, barring that, maybe that the occasional moment where someone I thought was being an asshole or I thought they were being a shitty person, the reason they're being a shitty person is because they thought that no one would call them on it. You know, and for me to call them on, it is more about there doesn't need to be any conflict here tonight, but you want to create it because you're an insecure little prick. So I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll be your huckleberry. All right. Now that you see that somebody was willing, now how much is it worth to you? And of course it's, it's almost, it's never worth it to them. And even people that have been all fucking fired up and you know, of course they're operating off of anger and emotion and, and of, of upping something to a point where they don't feel that they can back down.

Speaker 1:          00:58:19       Cause if you give someone an out, especially in these kinds of things, 90% of the time they take it but a this, that always that last word thing that everybody wants, they want to feel like it was winning the fight to a lot of dickheads. But you know when you, sometimes you turn to somebody, you go, you don't know anybody that knows anybody that knows anybody that knows anybody that can kicked my ass. So I don't know what you're going to do right now or who you're going to call it, but it ain't going to fucking work. Or it's just, you know, turn to somebody and you're like, how many friends you got with you? That ain't enough. You know, go get more because I don't know which one you guys want to get involved. But the first one that I can get my hands on too, I'm a fucking cripple you.

Speaker 1:          00:58:58       I'm a fuck you up. I'm a fuck you up. I don't know if you guys can take me, but I want to know how many of you I'm going to take with me first. Or my favorite is people nowadays don't really, so everything is the reduction to violence. Essentially. Everything is a reduction to violence at the base level. Finally, the final element is violence. So what I'm saying is that, so we create all the, we create laws, we create social norms, we create all the customs and things to honestly, to avoid things getting to violence. But even your simplest law is essentially rooted in the element of violence. So, okay. Uh, you, you will use some, some, some law, right? Like a ticket of some sort and it's like, Whoa, I'm going to find you for the thing. I'm not going to pay it. Oh, okay.

Speaker 1:          00:59:50       Well then we're going to find you some more. I'm not going to pay that. We're going to do this. I'm not going to do that. Well, okay then if you're not going to pay the thing, you're not going to, you're not going to do this and you're not going to let your not going to, oh, well then what we're going to do is we're going to arrest you. No, you're not. At some point it reduces down to violence. So we're using violence all the time too. Or at least the con, the for a lot of things for pretty much everything. You know, in terms of social controls. Eventually if someone doesn't want to adhere to those controls in some way, violence is the final solution. It's what it's, what it boils down to. It is the basis for, for all of our police and military and even honestly it still exists within all of us on a social level.

Speaker 1:          01:00:37       It's just that we have managed to take that concept and put it on to something else. The law, right? Police, something like that. But the reality is is that if some guy just at some point says, you know, I don't really give a fuck and you were an asshole and I'm just going to wreck you. Okay, you can sue them, you can do this. You can call the cops on him, you can whatever. But violence is going to happen whether you want it to or not and whether this person was in the right cause. That's another thing is like violence in and of itself. Even if you're the winner. Like I had to remember what philosopher once said, you know, winning the dual doesn't mean that you are correct. It just means that you one, you know, that's a good point. So tools. Yeah, but um, uh, so all these things are, are, you know, customs norms, all a lot of this stuff is to avoid anything breaking down to violence because you know, you bump into someone, you spill their drink and they turn in and go, hey man, well that was fucked up.

Speaker 1:          01:01:35       And you turn them and you go, you know what it was, I'm sorry. Or You could turn on me like, you know what? Fuck you. Fuck me. You spilled my drink. I have, I'm taking offense to this. I now don't have my drink. Who's going to make this right. I don't really give a shit, Huh. That everything starts to escalate. And as soon as, as, as one person takes a stand, and if that other person rising to that, to that next level to then, and they raised it again, eventually you get to a certain point, it's like, okay, what, where are we going with this? Where is the solution? Where does any of this lie ad it's, you've, you've stripped down all other options until he got to a point where all you got allowed yourselves was violence or to completely re pull yourself entirely out of that situation, which a lot of people aren't necessarily.

Speaker 1:          01:02:23       If it really, really, really got to that point, they're not willing to do because that was too much of the emotional maturity to realize they've made a mistake or to just not engage and not want to be a part of it. Yeah. But then there's that psychological thing of wanting to win. What a weird battle of words. Right? Well, and there's, there's uh, other complex things, like if it was a males, you know, there's social hierarchy stuff. Um, if it was females, their social eric, our stuff between that. If it's male on female, it could be, you know, well there's always this side up. If you're really super concerned about what other people think or how you're going to be perceived by others in a group setting, you know that that could also plan to a factor which happens, you know, out and about on the town or whatever. Your buddies always see you in this situation or other people. Everyone, okay, you got their attention now what are you going to do? And so if they see you completely retreat, everyone's like, uh Huh. All right. Well that guy really wasn't what he said he was

Speaker 5:          01:03:23       right, right, right. Yeah. You're not down, man. Did you ever see that thing where Sean Connery, uh, I was talking to Barbara Walters and she asked him about hitting chicks. Yeah, I've seen it. And he's like, sometimes she gives them to lash word [inaudible] from rough. They have to shape more when you're trying to get from one retro for Mark Level Schmuck. Yeah. That's just sad.

Speaker 1:          01:03:45       Was just like, uh, she didn't know what the fuck she thought she had them. Yeah. She thought it was over and he dug his heels in. He's impervious, I guess, you know. But, uh, I

Speaker 5:          01:03:57       no common his body because he probably fucked 15 different women that day. And it was just like Carne from non trench conversational. We're having Kira do I need just from Acura? I'm Barbara. I'm fucking Sean Connery. James. Look at the smile on his face and look at my mustache bald. I don't care. I'm on them. I'm a man's man. Let's play. Can we play it without getting pulled off of Youtube?

Speaker 6:          01:04:23       A woman now. And then as I remember you said you don't do it with a clenched fist. It's better to do it with an open hand. Yeah, I remember that. Yeah. Yeah. Remember that? I really love that. I haven't changed my opinion. It's to slap a woman. No, I don't think it's good. I don't think it's bad. I don't think it's that bad. I think that it depends entirely on the circumstances and if it merits it, oh, oh. What would merit it? Well, if you have tried everything else and women are pretty good at it, they can't leave it alone. They know what they want to have the last word. Then you'd give them the last, last one, but they're not happy with the last one. They want to share it again and get into a really provocative situation. Then I think you're absolutely right.

Speaker 5:          01:05:15       Wow.

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       Oh boy. Oh, that's so people get sean connery being rude and aggressive. Play that up. Next. What is, what is he getting rude and aggressive about it?

Speaker 7:          01:05:29       Do you work for the tabloid, the National Enquirer or your wedding? A jock strap on what? I've knocked. Not Tonight. Okay. That's why you're smiling. I haven't dated too tight. You probably knew you were going to be here. What? You make another film director again? Would you do another interview with me? I wouldn't do a film. Go. Wow. I don't know. I'm trunk on the rear. How are you? Funny. If that was right next to him, it's ready to take some deck.

Speaker 1:          01:06:09       Honestly, it didn't seem that rude or aggressive. They just didn't like the question and he fucked with them about it. Yeah. Well, clickbait in any ways. I personally do not put hands on women. I'm not in the mind into that. I also give her a chick tried to hit you though. Oh fuck yeah. Are you kidding me? No, I've been to, I've been chin checked while driving once I have a like snack. Oh that was cool that we had each other and that's, is that what it is? Wants to get fucked hall. You're not fucking her hard enough judge. Apparently not shit. Put your boots on those wrestling shoes he wore when you tap dance to a lace up motherfucker put some uh, some uh, some tack them on my arms. Make sure to get a good grip. You might want to throw the mattress on the ground.

Speaker 1:          01:06:51       Right. You know, so you could really like dig in. I can tell sort of thing. Really. You can really trust bottom that thing out. Yeah man. Like you will push up against a wall and a, your feet just on hardwood for, that's what I'm thinking. Right. You just planking and just, you know, driving actually offers carpeting. You had your bedroom like the stuff that stain resistant. Yeah. It's got that grip on it per gripping. Girls are like, what the fuck is this? Like why is your carpet show part fuck up? This is going to get real real in a second, but you're going to love me for it. I, no, I've been, I've been hit. Uh, I, uh, I'm not gonna, I'm not like, Oh, you've been in abusive relationships and not like that. I mean it's just people, it's frustrations and people not being able to manage those.

Speaker 1:          01:07:35       I remember one, uh, this Gal, uh, she trains, she fought and at one point and she used to do all kinds of shit, right to go. You know what? That is the most fucked up shit. You really abusing the fact you know your, your gender and that you know that you're a woman. So I'm not going to do anything, but you're going to do shit to me that if you were a man, I would just knock all your teeth out. Like you, you crossed so many lines and been so disrespectful and, and done things that are, you know, an invasion of personal space and respect. It's just like, man, that's just too much. Like you went way to you while you're driving? Yeah. Yeah. What if you went out bad? Have been hilarious. A girl knows how to fight and you know what? The person, well this one, but the one that punched

Speaker 8:          01:08:16       me while I was driving didn't know how to fight, but uh, yeah, well, you know, it's like they say to what the what the drunk guy, he passes out and he's always the one that doesn't get hurt. Right. So I would have been like, and then the car was cheap anyway, so I wouldn't have cared and she probably would have got tossed to the window. But, uh, uh, but I just remember her saying to me this one time, this the one that did train, she's like, you know what? You don't fucking kills me. I could, I could just hit you as hard as I wanted to. I could do whatever and it wouldn't fucking matter. Cause you know, cause you're, you and I bought and I, you're just so much to say we were installed and I'm just like, Jesus, fuck, why is that my fucking fault? Right. You know we're having a, we have an argument about something and you escalate it and then you're mad at me because you couldn't beat me up. At the end of it. You got so mad that you can't kick my ass and now that makes you matter.

Speaker 5:          01:09:05       Let me play armchair psychologist cause I'm good at this. What I would think is that a gal like that, first of all, she probably enjoys having a certain amount of physical power over people and went, Shit escalates. She wants that violence to be real. She wants it to be a real threat coming from her, which is why she probably started fighting in the first place. Now when she's fighting, when she's arguing with you, all the sudden she's in this fucked up situation where what she's worked for her whole life is to become the scary girl. Or the girl could fuck people up. A girl who's like literally a threat physically, she could probably knock a lot of dudes out, right? But she's confronted with a giant former UFC heavyweight champion and she's like, God dammit,

Speaker 8:          01:09:46       I doesn't work that, that psychology can absolutely hold true for this one particular girl. Um, for her, I think it was a matter of not being able to, you know, having this frustration about not being able to get the outcome that they wanted, um, and having what they would feel is no recourse to get me to, to come to term tom come to their terms and their way. And so she uses physical violence, never used physical violence, never worried about that then, uh, Nah, you know what it was, it just insecurity, it's insecurity and it was just like, how is that even, why, why? For one, you know, this, this, this girl, uh, I was with her for a long time. You know, I haven't, this one was a long time ago. My most recent one on the other hand, that one, I've actually seen use violence before.

Speaker 8:          01:10:40       Um, and it's just like, how to me, it's just like, even with, with arguing, we would get into these arguments and someone would make you know, statement a and I'd say, okay, well, uh, I don't think St Manet holds true because of these reasons. And then we'd start going and then all of a sudden statement a is get straw man into something else. And then, no, no, no. You can't leave statement a because you're basing your arguments on that. We're not talking about statement b. That's, that's a whole different scenario altogether. This argument isn't, is going nowhere now. Now it's getting circular and you keep taking me away from the original argument to begin with to start hitting you with six years ago you said this to me and stuff like that. It would be, it'd be something on, I dunno, she turned into a gigantic Marxists.

Speaker 8:          01:11:27       SJW So yeah. While you were dating her, yes. She turned sjws Social Justice Warrior, Ladies and gentlemen, if you're an online loan, it would just be like, well that, okay, hold on. That doesn't make sense. I don't, I don't know your, your logic here. I don't think falls, you know, being correct turned into this, like she didn't start out doing this. Uh, I think it existed, you know, she's from, she went to Berkeley. So, but nonetheless, it wasn't something that I ever saw, especially to begin with. It didn't seem like that was what I was in store for until one day. You know, I look over and I'm like, Huh, bass copy tall. Well, yeah, I think reading Marx is interesting and I think it's worthwhile to understand some of his, his arguments. And I think he's got some interesting critiques of capitalism, especially back in its day with it, with this industrialism, uh, industrial society at that time.

Speaker 8:          01:12:23       But he doesn't understand people at all. His solutions are fucking hackneyed and you know, he's coming from a very interesting position because he doesn't even, he as a person doesn't even stick to his own, his own shit, you know, but in any ways. So we're having these arguments and then it would turn to a pejorative and I'm like, well, okay, why are you attacking me? I'm not attacking you. I'm not even being angry about your statement. I just you, you made statement a so I don't believe in it. I don't, I don't think that that's correct. So we're having a discussion, but now it became a personal attack once even gets to that, let alone someone, even back in the day talking about, oh, it really upsets me that uh, no matter how angry you know, my, whatever, if I hit you or did this, it wouldn't matter because you're you.

Speaker 8:          01:13:11       It's like, well, both of these statements come from the same, same. Both of those scenarios come from the same place. It's like, well now you're trying, you're attacking me, the individual. Because if you're going to do that, you aren't thinking about me as the person that's, no, no, no. I got your back through heaven and hell, I will kick the gates of hell down and kill everyone there. If I got to the four year, they're there. They want to devalue a, they want to devalue me, the person, because they, they feel attacked in some way. They feel like they're, they're so attached to their, to their statement, to whatever that may be, which has some attachment to maybe what they feel is their existence. That to re to change that is dangerous. To haul it outright wrong would be an even bigger problem. And I mean, you know, I, it's just like this stuff would start showing up at the house.

Speaker 8:          01:14:02       And so I'm like, all right, I'm going to start doing research on marks and angles and all this different stuff. And then as I would go further and further and further down the rabbit hole, I come back and I go, oh, okay. So this argument stems from this and this and this and this and this. And they're like, no, it doesn't like, wow. Okay. Uh, why, why do you think people operate? Like what, what do you think their whole reasoning is? You know, we get into these arguments about capitalism and capitalism is a neutral system. Ask you this. What is it about social justice warriors are left wing people that were Marxism is so attractive to them. Uh, well for one it's, it's this idea of equity. Like this sameness, like everybody, nobody is being left behind and no one is, is becoming greater than anybody else.

Speaker 8:          01:14:43       Uh, it's also the idea, I like to think of it in, I think a lot of these young people look at it as grow mom's house, mom and dad's house. So when your mom and dad's house, someone does your laundry, someone cooks your food, you know, you always just show up. You got a place to live, uh, you know, the TV turns on and then they stable government should become mom and dad wants you. Exactly. So they want mom and dad's house to exist forever. So it's just like they can run off and do whatever they want to do for food. There's plenty of money for shelter. We just need to spend it. Right. Redistribution of wealth. Right, exactly. Because if you exceed that system more than they deem that you should have, then you should give it to somebody else. And it's like, well, how do you think I got this?

Speaker 8:          01:15:26       Oh my God, how many? I'm sorry to interrupt you. Go ahead. Let's just like, how do you think I got this? Uh, people can say, well, it was you got it through you and inherited it. Okay, that does happen. I could also have got it through hard work and dedication and some, some guile and some smarts and made it happen for myself. Does that somehow mean that I had to do it at the expense of someone else? Not necessarily shitty argument. Right. That's the, but that's the argument that they keep bringing us. But if you're successful, you did it on the bits all grant. It's all grift. Yeah. What do you think? Why would, this is what I wanted to ask back from someone else is an interesting thing too. It's like if someone agrees to do a job, if their skill set is limited in such a way that they were owned, that they were capable of doing this job at this moment.

Speaker 8:          01:16:10       Now of course, if you're asking me, they probably, they have a potential to do more than that. As long as they're willing to invest back in themselves and find another skill or expand that skill. You know there's always possibility for growth within a human being, within their lot in life, whatever that is and that that could be transferred into work could be transferred into a personal goals. I mean it's all about how you value things also. So this person gets into this job working, making widgets for this guy who invented this widget. This guy invented the widget, the argument that okay, the worker deserves just as much as the guy that invented it. It's like well hold on. Without the guy that invented the widget, you have no job. Like all of these people that are working out, working underneath them get would have nothing. They would have zero, there would be no widget to build. And the guy that made the widget also has the most responsibility because he had to come up with the money to produce the widget to be able to hire the people to make the widget, to then market the widget to do all these

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       things to the widget to get it out there to make it successful enough to then support more people. And that doesn't necessarily mean it's on the back of that other person. Because you could also say, well, is everything on the back of the guy that made the widget? I mean, do you just, his idea is not worth it. Is, is not, can't be belonged to him because he created it. We, we should take it for us, even though we never, we did not come up with it. We never created it. We didn't even have the facilities to make to created and didn't invent it are the ones who want to define how much this guy should get for inventing it versus how much they share. And I would get into arguments with my ex about, she's like, oh, I think all businesses should be ops and my thing.

Speaker 1:          01:17:47       You're like, what does that mean? Well cooperative where everybody is getting an equal share and into the business itself. Yeah, I would say it is hilarious and also because I would say all businesses can be co ops. There is no one stopping a business from being a co op. We know it stops businesses from being a co op. If somebody doesn't want it to be a co op or a, someone decides, well that doesn't, I can't do it that way so it won't make as much sense for me to create a co op situation as it would to not or a colab sounds nice and enforced. Co op does not sound nice. Of course club sounds nice if like say if you and I live on a block and we say, Hey, we got this fucking patch of land. Let's start a garden started a little small farm.

Speaker 1:          01:18:26       Correct. We'll just have a little co op here. Right. All right, cool. Great. Yeah. Beautiful. But that's everybody doing volunteer and says, Josh Barnett, is this the Josh Barnett Farm? Yeah. Well you're going to have to turn this into a co op and you're like, what the fuck I am. Well, we're going to put you in jail. Exactly. And then it's, then it comes back down to violence. Here's the question. This is what I kept meaning to ask before I forget. Do you think that the, what do you think the numbers are of the people that are involved in these ideas that have never competed in anything? Now that's, my ex girlfriend is a professional fighter and she fights in tour. However, the idea of the meritocracy, of being a fighter, it seems it's not, I don't think it's lost on her. I just think that she, she doesn't like the way it's worked out for her and that makes her an upset.

Speaker 1:          01:19:14       Whereas for me, I found success as being a fighter and it sometimes it would appear that she would be, she would be upset at me for what I was able to do and somehow think that maybe I was less deserving or somehow, um, it's an exception that who knows what, but the reality is, is like I can sit back and go, oh, Mark Hunt just made $800,000. Her thought might, it might be more, let's say if we're, we're just, I'm making this up. I'm not saying that she said this, you know, he's like, well, why does he deserve $800,000? Why I make a $4,000 or $5,000 or whatever. I've seen people say that, right? It's just like, okay, well I could think of plenty of reasons. And then he draws more tickets. He's got a better record. He's, he's one, he's a k one she champ or whatever, you know, at the end of the day, if any in New Zealand. Right, right. And if he's selling more tickets than you are,

Speaker 8:          01:20:08       then he gives it, he deserves a greater percentage of that money. Now, now you come to me and I'd be like, well, I beat Mark Hunt. Right? But what's her argument for that when you say that? Uh, her argument for that would be that, you know, this other person isn't any more deserving than,

Speaker 5:          01:20:24       so everybody should get paid the same. So Jon Jones, Fides, Daniel Cormier, Yay. Huge fight. Everybody on the undercard gets a fair share.

Speaker 8:          01:20:30       Well either that or just like, well, I deserve more than this. And it's, and my argument would always be when, when, when she was upset about what she may be getting paid here or there and some of this, I'd go, well, look, you know, for, for this, for what we're trying to accomplish and for what, what is available in these markets, that's not a bad payday. Well, that sucks. No, I agree with you. You should make more money, but we can't, it's not available. So we have to deal with what we have for me. And then I would look at something like Mark Hunt and be like, well, I beat mark comp. It's so what? I'm more glad that Mark Hunt was able to create an opportunity to make $800,000 so therefore if he can make $800,000 now the potential for me do that exists as well.

Speaker 8:          01:21:11       And it's just similar to like the old Gina Carano thing where everyone got on a train about wanting to be Gina Carano fucked junior crunch, not even that good, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. All this hate at Gina Carano. When the reality is like, okay, well even if you beat Gina Carano, you're not going to get what Gina Carano gets. You're not going to get that and people aren't going to like you just as much or more. It's really not about any of that. The only thing you can control is yourself. At the end of the day, you can only control yourself. You can, you only you can can work to try and increase or you're in determine your value in terms of what you're trying to sell, but isn't part of selling today at least talk shit. Some of it

Speaker 5:          01:21:45       seems to be like because of honor his proficiency at it. Yeah. And his massive financial success because of it

Speaker 8:          01:21:53       wins. He wins all the time. He won belts, he made very bold statements and then went out in one. Um, another person could then go and talk shit. Maybe they win and people still don't care as much. Right. You know, you can't force people to care. And what makes them care is a metric that you just can't define. You know, there's one way of doing it is to make them all hate you. But when you lose your, your, what's going to happen is you're going to drop off. Often everything that you gained will be lost. But as they hate you, as you continue to win, they're going to be more in incited to watch you fight. They're going to be more interested to watch you fight.

Speaker 5:          01:22:33       Big Guy like randy coture, everybody loves. And even when he loses, everybody loves in the same. Sure.

Speaker 8:          01:22:37       And, and you know how that combination comes about is

Speaker 5:          01:22:41       magic. Well, I think with randy, it's sincerity, but I think, look, look at Kevin Lee and Michael [inaudible] from this past weekend. Perfect example of like a few of these guys put together talking shit to each other at a press conference. They get in a scuffle at a press conference and all of a sudden everybody cares about the result of this fight. And then the fight has a controversial ending and now it's even more crazy. And now there's a lot of eyes on Kevin Lee and Michael Essa

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       that three, four months ago, just saying both guys are super talented, chef guys have some really good wins. And um, I think Kevin Lee's get some real fucking potential. But people weren't really talking about on the way they are now. So a lot of other fighters are going to look at that and go, yeah, that's what I gotta do. I've gotta Talk Shit on Gina Carano or I've got to talk shit on. A lot of that is, is what, what the Gina Carano thing, that was insecurity and that was also, she was a superstar and the only thing was, and people want it, they thought that they could have what she had by taking it from her. And it's like, well, that's not actually how it works. You can, you can beat her and that'll definitely do something for you and by fighting her it's going to elevate your status but not the same status.

Speaker 2:          01:23:47       I know Holly Holm, you're your own knocks out Rhonda. Sure. I mean she devastated Rhonda, right? She was the first one. Right. Is undefeated. It looks like a tank that's coming at her and holly wines of head kicking her and knocking her out. I mean, holly is still a really highly respected professional fighter, but you mean it's not the same? It doesn't have the same. Well, it also did something for her. Her accolades coming in, so she's just heavily touted boxing champion. That boxing championship looks more interesting now after she goes and she wins the MMA belt too. Let me ask you this, why don't they set up Cyborg versus her? Isn't that the fight Cyborg versus Holly Holm? Is Holly Holm drawn to me? I don't know. A lot of people thought Holly Holm should have won that fight. It was a very close fight and Duran to me definitely hit her twice after the bell.

Speaker 2:          01:24:34       Really significant and should have been a penalization. So why the fuck is holly fighting? I know she just fought [inaudible] but as soon as Megan Anderson dropped off, if holly could take it, I mean she didn't have, I love, she was not injured. It maybe she is. Who knows? She might be managers. Yeah. Who knows lookers. Who knows? Who knows what, but that's the fight. That's an interesting fight. Holly versus Cyborg is the fucking fight. It would be a great fight. I think people would be interested to watch it, but for sure not the fight it's being made and say we don't Tonya average juror stepping up and fighting a Cyborg and Stan. Yeah, and short notice, you know, but Tanya's a Gamer, she's very tough. She will fight anybody. He would fight the fight because of that, because she's so tough. That's what makes it exciting.

Speaker 2:          01:25:16       But you know, cyborgs. That giant person is, she was massive. She bought for explosive, which to me, explosiveness in women's MMA is a massive difference between success and not like if you're, if you're super explosive, like that usually makes a massive, a big difference. In terms of your success rate, did you see cyborgs barn with Claressa shields two time Olympic gold medal in boxing and hanging in there? Man. I mean, she's an outbox for sure, but not by much. She landed some good shots. She's still game and moving forward, fighting and throwing stuff. Dangerous and dangerous against a super high level boxer. A girl that's even arguably bigger than her too. Yeah, and lightening fast. Yeah, but watching shields, like we've set things up and use that jab like, dude, I just want to

Speaker 1:          01:26:06       learn some fucking sprawl specialization. You know? That's the thing about boxing and the connor and mayweather fight is it's the specialization of, of a boxer versus the MMA person. I would say the MMA fighters, the superior fighter, right. When you, when you start to me the most open and he, the most, even playing field is the one that has at least rules. But by funneling that down to those specific skill sets with boxing, you create a specialized athlete. While there are skills with boxing that will transfer to mma, even just in terms of boxing, uh, the, the, the timing and the footwork that you might use in boxing isn't necessarily what you would use in mma and uh, and vice versa. Distance. Right. But so I see that, you know, it would be great if conor goes out there and wins. It would make mma look that much bigger, you know, but uh, and he's got the power and he, he's a, he's a great athlete and he's got good timing and accuracy.

Speaker 1:          01:27:03       I just don't see him being able to get flush on mayweather the way that it's going to be needed. It seems highly unlikely unless he old school Bernard Hopkins Hymns, you know, remember Bernard used to fight, he's to clinch guys and just sear. Sure. Off muffin clinch outside. He was just straight defensive. But do you really think that boxing referee's are going to let that happen? I don't know. And there's going to be even more eyeballs on conner to diminish that aspect because they're going to be expecting him to do stuff like that anyways there or you know there's, I'm sure there's already, I've heard that there are elements in the contract about kicks and things like that. They have to put that in there. That would have to put that in there, some sort of side dish to haul off and kick him and that's it.

Speaker 1:          01:27:43       You lose all your money. Yeah, that makes sense. But I feel like if you, if you looked at conner and like his skill set, like what's what he's capable of doing. Like overall I could see how he would think like man, it's just striking. I feel like I could probably get close enough. Yeah, I can get off on anybody. Sure. But that level that floyd mayweather is at like to have zero professional boxing fights and to spar with him and you know also from Congress perspective he's thinking I this is a chance to be a hero. This is another opportunity to be a hero. I have hardly anything to lose, if at all. And all to gain the potential of winning. I also have a big payday winter lose, so everything works out towards a win win situation for him. You know, it would've been great if connor could get, get this stipulation will only box, but we were mma gloves. Yeah. Well a floyd has had issues with his hands in the past, which is why he almost exclusively where's winning gloves in the there. So that would never happen. Thick fat glass. And I think they're fighting with 10 ounce gloves too. It's a big glove. Tends not eight. No, I don't think so. I think the, the agreed upon weight was 10 see if that's the case. Is that the case? Yeah. Ah, ah, I'm surprised. Interesting. I would've thought eights something a little bit like what? 147 pounds

Speaker 8:          01:29:02       or 150

Speaker 5:          01:29:02       fight. 55 okay. And I think I thought 60 was the cutoff, but [inaudible] 68 or one 74 where they go to 10. Huh. But uh, either way much bigger than four. Which is what gs accustomed to. Yeah. And I feel like if, but look man, it's still, you know, I had a conversation with a buddy of mine who's a really good jujitsu black belt and he was gonna fight in mma and he had very little sparring in terms of like mma sparring or very little, uh, kickboxing sparring, almost no strike king. And uh, I said, you know how you can do things to be bull on the ground where you get some guy who does know what he's doing, you can just do whatever the fuck you want to him. I go, this guy's, they can do that too. Standing up like you gotta be careful. Like you can't get this in your head that you're awesome at something. So you're awesome at everything, right. Cause the, the type of mentality that a person has to become, whether it's a championship level mma fighter or a boxers that that focus, that intense focus. Like sometimes guys get twisted and they think that because of my Brazilian Jujitsu champion, I can be a kickboxing champion. I could be an MMA champion, do whatever the fuck I want to do, but the road is long, man, the road is long.

Speaker 8:          01:30:11       People forget all that they went through to acquire such a set of skills to get there in the first place. And I understand that, you know, a highly, highly specialized Jujitsu or wrestler can go out there and experience success in mma right away. However, like you said, they might come across that guy who is so good on their feet that they can do the whatever they want to to that guy and just leave them clueless and when, or does he take them down or there's that where that there's that person that you're just not able, you take them down once, twice, but they could keep your Mac their feet. Now all of a sudden you're tired. You've been pushing so much harder because you can't fight Eh, a, a plan B or, or in this other plane you have to fight within the plane that you're an expert because you put all your marbles in one basket,

Speaker 5:          01:30:59       not a mighty mouse. So you can kind of do it all in any forum. Your a Damien Maia who's learned how to kickbox got really good at it, but when you fight Damien Maia, you know, real clear what his plan is

Speaker 8:          01:31:10       for sure. And even still at Damien Maia has, has learned to create striking that that helps mitigate other people's striking so that he can get his best game off. Yeah. So that's still a type of standup work that he's working on within that has been specialized for mma as he fights in the UFC. Do you agree though

Speaker 5:          01:31:31       that a guy like conor mcgregor would have way more like, I feel like the odds of floyd beating conor are extremely high in a boxing match and the nine high 90% sure. Right. But the odds of connor beating floyd an MMA match or 100 pretty much. Pretty much 199.9999999 Connie would have to like really fuck up. He'd have to get chin checked. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       Doing something stupid now he would just not kicking, right? Yeah. He would kick the shit out of his leg. This isn't, this isn't a fight about who's a better fighter. Right. This is a fight about who's a better boxer. Yeah. And the idea that Congress is going to step in and just clang floyd with a straight left is almost as ridiculous as the idea that flow is going to step into an mma fight and catch connor with a big punch and knock them out. Ray Mercer, Tim, Tim Silvia, Silvia style. I say it's more like floyd mayweather jumping in that cage and armbarring car. You know, it's like that. Yeah. Catching him in a fucking rolling teen. Yeah. Fucking victor role and do a knee bar. Get hit him with an MNR. He's been catch him with one of them crazy heel hooks, like you know floyd and his heel hooks.

Speaker 2:          01:32:46       Ah, well when, that was one of the crazy things with James. Tony fought randy coture like there's all these people speculating like how much James Tony had been training mma and then he got to see him do some stuff with like an MMA trainer and you're like, oh, okay. He's not barely doing this. He's barely doing this. He does that. He stopped. He doesn't know anything. Well, this is crazy. And then randy just goes out there. The angle, the single and the ankle just falls over in that end of that night. Yeah. Low single randy on top. That's a wrap. Randy was merciful though. I mean you punched him a few times and then just choked him. Yeah. Yeah. Randy isn't really, he wasn't known for being a particularly vicious competitor. You have a feeling you probably would have treated that situation slightly differently. Yeah. I would've tried to term absolutely limb from limb.

Speaker 2:          01:33:29       Not, not, not because of any particular personal animosity, just because I go out there to wreck people because I want to make sure that if I'm winning, I'm winning. But if you had a guy like, like a James Tony on the ground who came in from pr, professional boxing, no one may fights, would you have it in your mind that you need to prove a point? Did you have in your mind just finishing when you can smash them any way possible? You know, I chop his leg, whatever, shoot a double blow through them, get on top and then just start doing whatever is available for such a nice guy and such a well spoken guy. You enjoy hurting people in a very disturbing way. I, it's what I'm good at. It's what I was, that's what I, I learned at an early age that it was something that I excelled at.

Speaker 2:          01:34:11       I asked you just in partly to see your response because I knew that you're going to get worked up about it and he were to think about smashing him and like what you would do. Like it's seen in your eyes thinking about taking them down. I love, I love, that's part of the reason why by leaving fighting I know was going to be tough not competing because I love going out there and in some way it is. I was explaining this, I was actually out of philosophical lecture the other night and uh, cause I'm a big fan of philosophy. What was the philosophical, well, this, this lecture was on 16 part series on a America and it was this last one. This friend of mine hit me up. She goes, hey, this thing's going down, uh, at this, this, this school. So, hey, why don't, why don't we go check it out? All right, cool. And so

Speaker 8:          01:34:58       it had something to do with the futurism and I forget what else, but as the lecture was going on, people would chime in and say stuff. And so at one point, I'm listening to some of these, these arguments that I'm just going, man, you just don't really, you don't understand people that well. I mean, every, a lot of these arguments always come from some idea of a base motivation from somebody. Like the idea that all capitalism is theft. It's like, well, you know, you don't have to be a horrible person to operate successfully within a capitalist system. Just as much as just because you create a communist system doesn't necessarily make you benevolent. Because as you will look in the Soviet Union and as you've had, um, uh, um, Robert, uh, our, uh, Jordan Peterson on here, and he'll tell you all of the elements of, of the brutality of communist systems.

Speaker 8:          01:35:50       And then of course, I remember being in the 80s and even seeing a slides from, uh, one of my teachers who was over in the Soviet Union and sneaking photos out of the USSR because they didn't want any photos of, of living conditions and all these sorts of things, bread lines, all that stuff brought back to the western world because they felt it would make them look bad. Well, of course, because it did, you know, and people were entrenched in these systems and abusing these systems to their benefit, just like Paul or politicians abused our system to their benefit, just like all human beings will abuse the system to its benefit when given the chance to do so, either out of selfishness to the point of maliciousness or even just direct maliciousness. So the human element is the, the key process in all systems there. They're pretty much the cause of all systems failing.

Speaker 8:          01:36:41       And they always will be. But when you try to create some other roundabout idea, you try to assign, uh, you know, these other crazy concepts as to why or you know, you create these micro group I ideologies and you distill and distill and distill and you constantly create like with, with Marxism, it's a conflict theory. So there's always has to be some sort of a presser. There always has to be a conflict. And you know, a lot of human beings aren't out there trying to oppress people. They're just trying to get theirs and or you know, creating their little tribes and creating what they, you know, to use a overused word, safe space for themself that which they understand this area. They understand these demarcations about this group and these people and this thing and even this area of land in which you live in, you know, the idea of going, I know I'm going off on a tangent here from our original discussion, but the idea of like personal property and you know, you have your fence line around let's say a piece of property.

Speaker 8:          01:37:41       I was walking through Joshua Tree and looking at all this stuff and pondering some things and, and you know that, that that property line isn't just about me owning this and keeping other people out and being and looking at it and someone wants to say, Oh, you just want to be selfish and own and be greedy and dominate something. And it's like, well actually think about it this way. That line is the same as an extension from my own personal space. You know, I know you so fuck, you know, you can get right in my personal space and I don't care because we've already vetted each other. We've already had a relationship. W I, I, I have a good understanding of who you are as Joe Rogan and, and your being in the world and you understand me to a degree as well as Josh Barnett versus some guy just shows up at your house versus some guys, some things, some, anything that you don't know you don't know is, so you have this fence line is, is what you're doing is you're, you're creating this space that is just in a person.

Speaker 8:          01:38:31       It's just an extension of your own personal bubble of your own personal safe space. And so within that you feel like you've vetted it, you know these rocks, you know these planets, you understand the, the pluses and minuses of this area that exists. And so within this place of existence, you can be your most authentic self without any concern of the rest of the world. Now if somebody's something was to come and want to cross that line, you'd want to say, well, I don't know what it is yet. So I want to vet that source and then say, okay, yeah, it's okay. I'll allow you into my, into my space, into my area. And so now you too can also be open to the vulnerability that I'm giving you because that's what it is. You know, our personal space is about our vulnerability, about the ability for someone else to, you know, interact with us physically as well as emotionally.

Speaker 8:          01:39:22       And so even just having your little cabin with your little fence, that little thing isn't just again, have that right. It is a Marxist ideas of no private property and acre. Yeah. There's not like a lot of full on old school marxists anymore. They're all pretty much neo marxists from the, as as Peterson and other people have described from the Frankford schools, uh, you know, uh, uh, permeating into the academia and, and going after the, the superstructure instead of the base. I think this is an undeniable aspect that you talked about before were with your ex girlfriend at least, or with some people like that. We don't even have to single out her that people that are not successful in this, in the competition of life seek to diminish the success of those around them. And yes. Yeah. Which is, so it's, it's the other thing about that is the value that you create where, where, what is your values were, what is your value system and, and how is that going to influence you?

Speaker 8:          01:40:21       So if you, if your value system is based on external elements, like, you know, Nisha talks about the, the danger of unchecked envy, envy being a life affirming element. You know, if I envy Joe Rogan and his podcast, which I do, I can see that, well joe was able to create this podcast. So the possibility exists. So for, for a person to create a podcast and they'd be successful with and expand from there on out so that mv can drive me to then work towards it because I know it's a possibility. Having unchecked envy would be to be angry at you for having that podcast

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       and thinking that, well, you know, he's got this thing and I want that thing. How do I deserve it too? And I don't have dessert. It burn it to the ground. Why? Because you're so upset about it. But that's the lowest of self esteems right? The people that not only do they not think they can't compete, they don't want anyone to be successful because they don't think they're ever going to be every day without social, with, through, throughout social media. People are seeing Mandy manufactured manicured interpretations of life and thinking and weighing themselves against that. So that's just one example of how you are using these external forces to determine your value systems are putting value on things that are beyond your control or, or putting value in areas that are unnecessary, that are actually harmful to you. And so people, if I had to just walk away from everything, like my muscle cars and all that stuff, and I know, I know it's a horrible thought.

Speaker 2:          01:41:47       I have a, I have some projects that are, that are going to be to completion here soon that are, I'm just so looking forward to, are you still driving the challenge of though that your main mode of transportation is? My daily driver, but I'm replacing it with a 75 formula firebird with four 55 that I punched out the four 70 automatic overdrive trans and hotchkiss suspension, wilwood brakes all the way around on it. It's going to be fucking great. Nine inch board in the back. Speaking of which Gabriel Iglesias was just on Jay Leno's garage. Yeah. And he's got a dope Burt Reynolds fucking smoking the bandit Trans Am. Yeah, they do build them up for the new Camaro's. Yeah, he was loving it. But is that what his, his, his, his from the delta, the new Camaro. I just saw the picture of him with standing with Jay next to the car.

Speaker 2:          01:42:29       That car looks, it is a, it's a sweet car. I've seen him at Sema car that doesn't impress girls at all. That's only for Liga, that fucking thing. So that's based on the one on the left. The one on the left is a real old one. 27 78 has a brand new one. Holy Shit. So there's, Oh my God. They put a front new new nose piece on it and they put the Shaker scoop. They put it and this one he put it, they put an ls three and because they do all this stuff for folks, folks who don't know it doesn't even exist anymore. I wonder if they could do that with the Zl one. I'll do it with anyone. Zl One of the fastest cars to ever lap the nurburgring yes. Faster than the corporate zero six fascinating. It's incredible what we're doing with cars.

Speaker 2:          01:43:11       But if I had to give all the shit out now, if I have to give all this shit up, I would hate it. That's amazing. I would hate it. Love it. Yeah. It's a burt burt reynolds addition. Holy Shit. He signed it. Yeah. So, but if I did truth be told, I look at the hearse shifter as hard as a rock truth. Truth be told, I can, I can get rid of all these things. I can be free of all of that stuff and still have a life that makes me highly, uh, happy craves Nancy. I know. I don't want to, I just want to get crazy extreme. Those Marxists. They're fucking with your head man to change in your value. You know, they want to take my firebird and my gt 500, all that stuff, but uh, and I can't help it that my car has more boosts in yours. Yeah, you can't. But, uh,

Speaker 8:          01:43:57       uh, the thing is, is that it's where I put my values were what, what, what is valuable to me and what's valuable and living and being so for someone else, they put these things on other stuff and they, they give responsibility. What they end up doing is transferring that power to external sources. And when you start working off of external sources as your, your value is your value system, then you've taken away that power from yourself.

Speaker 2:          01:44:23       Right. And so, well, there's also the rejection. I have a rejection of the idea that you can enjoy people's creations. I think of a car is a creation. Yeah. I'm going to think of it a lot of ways is like a mass produced piece of art. Sure. You know what someone's done in creating like that? Uh, that new a, what is it? The Demon? Yeah. Dodge demon. Right. That challenge or that we'll go nine sixties. It goes zero to 60 in less than three seconds. And it's a production car. You can't drive it. If it's colder than 15 degrees out, he can't drive it. It's like, it's such a, it's such a fucked up car. But like that to me is I'm fascinated that someone chose to make it. I liked, if I look at that the same way I look at them doing space exploration, like, oh, that's all going to trickle down to regular cars.

Speaker 2:          01:45:08       Sure. You know, they're going to figure out how to make tank out of this. Sure. And that's the thing is that these things wouldn't exist if people weren't driven to, uh, to express their will, to power and grow, to want to be their greatest version of themselves, to create a greater thing than the last thing to, to push that envelope. Right. And while it's not always going to be successful, it's the idea of creating something greater and greater, greater. Now, I mean, there's the argument with, with science that there's always a, you know, is it, uh, should, uh, or could, uh, you know, of course there is an element of ethics. It has to play into that I think that you need to be aware of and is also with objects you don't want to get obsessed and fixated on that. Rejects, but it doesn't mean you can't enjoy a new laptop. Right. Well, and I think that a lot of these, these new like champagne socialist type folks, they, they enjoy, they enjoy these, the new lab laptops

Speaker 8:          01:45:59       in the new iphones and all that stuff and it's, they love all the modern conveniences of the capitalist country that we live in. And you know, if someone wanted to sit down and talk to me about the, the danger they out the elements of our society, of our capitalist economy and how it, it is an, is an issue, the issues within it now. Totally. I get it. No, our system is fucked up and a lot of ways, don't get me wrong, but by replacing it with, with, uh, you know, some sort of a Marxist system now you're just asking for, I mean, we already have enough trouble with people in power being unsuitable and in a sense like us being hiving of very ineffective way of really effecting our political system and creating change within it and having things taken away or new laws created, altered, like it's so impossible.

Speaker 8:          01:46:52       Right. But it's like, it's a system that works outside of us, even though we're supposedly the ones that can quick can control it. But, uh, it, you create a, uh, a communist system, right? You create a full states, a secured system, you really have no ability to affect that, right. Without some sort of a violent revolution, which, uh, doesn't, not probably in your best interest, uh, with the way technology and military and all that stuff. I mean, it's just, I mean, no one wants to things to get to that point. And so, so they always preach a ramp down version of it though, because like the, well, there's never any true, by the way, there's never been a true, a true communist system or they're never been true Marxism. It's always the fucking no true scotsman fallacy. It's like, it never happened. This never happened yet.

Speaker 8:          01:47:37       It's like, what the fuck do you think the, the, the Soviets were doing? What do you think that the malice, they all thought they were doing it. Right. Right. You know, but it, and even then when you go to look at China nowadays, like, well, they got all these capitalists elements within it that are making their economy just fucking flush with money, so flushed with money that they're, they're like, oh, I don't want to give it to the government. So they send it all over to Vancouver and buy up all these houses and stuff like this and then have their teenage kid lived there all over Hollywood, even Bel Air. Right. A lot of, a lot of Asian money, a lot of money from Saudi Arabia as well. Right. And you know, Saudi Arabia, you know, you're talking theocracy. Yeah. And they're worried about their money getting taken away over there.

Speaker 8:          01:48:16       So they drive by real estate over here. Yeah. And also it's very valuable, like keeps going up. It's a good investment and when you're making trillions of dollars by sucking oil out of the ground. Sure, sure, sure. And, you know, at the end of the day, um, uh, the thing about all this stuff is that, that the, when the, if you give people the most opportunity to be free, you're also giving the most opportunity to be shitty. And you have to accept that. You just have to accept that some people are just going to be fucking assholes. Some people are going to be Shitty, some people are going to try and create a system that, that you're not gonna like it's gonna reward others for things you don't think it should, but you're always going to get those hedge fund dudes. You're always going to get those guys who have those gigantic estates in the Hamptons and fuck people, you know, and my girlfriend, uh, graduated with a, with a physics degree, didn't use it.

Speaker 8:          01:49:06       Okay, fine, but you spent all this money to go to that school and should it have cost that much money? Should, should the rates on loans be with you? I don't think so. I think that's, that's a real scam. You, you know, you didn't probably understand or we're ill equipped to understand like all of us were when it came to school. Yeah. When you're 18, you don't know what the fuck do. I mean we didn't really understand how, what a racket it was at the time. So I, you know, I totally feel for her there. And then, so then she goes, she gets a different job doing something else but made her great money but she hated it. Didn't like it. What didn't want to be in that. All right. So then chose to fight and do like, you know, personal trainers stuff and then would always gripe about how she didn't make enough money and it's like, well, you could do, okay, well then how about this, you, you charge x amount per hour normally.

Speaker 8:          01:49:49       Well, how about you set a limit to where you get to x amount of people and then once you go over that, now you double the, the fee because it's not really worth it to you anymore, is it? So you create, uh, an increase in you, you see what your, what your minimum is. And then over that and if people are wanting to pay it, then they pay it. Why couldn't do that? That would be, that would be unethical to charge these people double what I'm charging these people or whatever. It's was like, well, okay then how about you create a class schedule set up and you iron out some time here and it's very specific here. Instead of teaching one person, you teach five people, but then you charge them, you know, two thirds what you charge it. No, it's just like, well I could, it's like, well, okay, if you, at the end of the day we have to do what we need to do to pay our bills and do these things and do whatever, but we also have to determine how we acquire those bills to what our expenses are going to be.

Speaker 8:          01:50:39       And if we can't create a system that supports that, then we have to reevaluate that and then change appropriately. The one thing we can't do is just be upset, you know? And that's what people like to do, of course, because they would like it to be, oh, I can do this or I can do, I should be able to do this. I should be able to do that. It's like, well, nobody can. You can't do these things. You can and just chase their tail, go around in circles. Freedom, uh, being truly free, and let's just say an existential sense means that you have to take responsibility for all these actions, but it's also all on you to find your own success. And that means you're going to fail. That means you're going to struggle. That means all these difficult, you're going to happen. But I personally believe that through struggle and these difficulties, that's where growth comes as well.

Speaker 5:          01:51:26       Well, the question is what's the alternative? The alternatives. What? You sit around and complain whenever someone else's more successful than you sit around and complain that you're not making enough money. You sit around and complain that the deck deck is stacked against you. Sit around and complain that you didn't use your education. Sit around and complain that in your field of choice. And it didn't succeed.

Speaker 8:          01:51:42       Here's the other thing. A lot of people then want to find somebody who is the reason for their downfall. This thing is what's keeping me from, uh, being successful as the boyfriend. I wasn't, you know, I, everything I did was to help as much as I grow. Too Big, too much shit, too opinionated, too smart and tired. Um, yeah, I, I put it, I, you know, at the end of the day, you know, fuck, I got, you know, I got completely betrayed and cheated on for months in the end of it. So it's just like, oh, well, you know, I put all this investment into trying to help this other person and create a life with them only to get completely screwed over in the end. But I'm sorry day about that. But we're getting super personal here. It's true. But, but what it comes down to also is that when you look at these kinds of things, you have to say, well, okay, well what would I have done differently?

Speaker 8:          01:52:34       And you should be like, for the most part, you shouldn't have done anything differently. You know, when you invest in somebody else, when you do for somebody else, you don't do it for the return or for what you think you're to get out of them. You do it because you're doing it because it, it is what you believe is the right thing to do. And then to be, you know, you can be upset about other, the way things have turned out. You can be upset about like, well, you know, ethically I think you did this or you did that and you can be upset about those things. But then two, it's just like whenever you come across that person that just has nothing but shitty things to say about their, like, it's probably you. Oh Dude, you know, for me, I could be like, Nah, I thought my ex was the greatest woman I'd ever met.

Speaker 8:          01:53:12       And she absolutely possessed the qualities that, uh, aligned with that. But she also had some really terrible ones that ended up being, you know, horrible. Whenever you meet someone and all they do is complain about their axes, it's usually there's a little of them and what they're saying. But see that that's just, you know, this is just human beings in their own existence and so be it their relationship, be it their business, be it, you know, all these things are, are all stemming from the same elements within themselves. Now they are subject to others, very specific elements too. Like things that relationship like what kind of elements? Well, okay. When it comes to a point to like what's the, for most people, like what's the, the big factor in not getting their shit together. Uh, the big factor, not getting their shit together is not coming to terms with their own inefficiency, uh, failures or inability to accomplish a certain task and looking outside of that for a reason versus looking internally to see like, I didn't have enough a skill to do x, y to do this thing or I didn't put in enough time to acquire the skill to do that.

Speaker 8:          01:54:22       Or I made a mistake here that costs this when it comes to our relationships, you know, it's there. What, where it lives, where the difficulty lies. There can be specific to different emotional elements, Dubai, you know, versus your work versus, uh, how you even find time to make the most out of your, your leisure time. You know, these are the, every, every situation has its own subjectivity to it based on these other external factors that change from each situation. But ultimately everything stemming from you anyways. So your way of approaching these things and dealing with these problems and how you let them affect you. And I'm not just talking about being a complete stoic and being just cold and unfeeling, unaffected and I'm feeling, it's just about having these things happen. And then what do you do about it? You know, how do you also, how do you measure that metric?

Speaker 8:          01:55:19       If you have the greatest year of life and then you have, you know, an hour that's super shitty in traffic, did that become, and that really stuck with you and someone hit your car and your, you know, my challenge has got a dent in it and it's like, ah, did I really have the worst day ever or did I just have an hour of an aggravation that sucked. But ultimately how can that, if I allow that to take away from everything that happened up to that point, then, you know, I just assigned all this value into this one moment that really it was unnecessary trained. A lot of fighters you work. Do you, do you sit down and talk to them about this kind of shit as well? 100% is this a big part of like how you like think about it as a program for sure. Because whoever I take under my wing, I don't just train people to train them.

Speaker 8:          01:56:07       Um, I don't eat them. Being fighters is one piece of their life. One element once, honestly, eventually it'll be, it'll be a small element, but it, but it has a lot of impact and meaning I mentor people when I work with them. I'm trying to help them visualize and achieve their greatest state of being from what they can get. Now, fighting may be a vehicle to help try to achieve that, but ultimately they're living their life and they have a, they have something that they're trying to accomplish with that. And so for me, I'm trying to help them realize what that is and that's going to be different from other, for other people. Just as much as you can't coach everyone the same way. Everybody needs something a little different in terms of what they're trying to achieve. And people want to achieve different things.

Speaker 8:          01:56:55       Of course, they've got this, they have this element of fighting and success within fighting that that is a bond that is a similarity amongst the rest of them and even amongst me. But beyond that, that changes from there on out. So, um, you know, just recently I've been working with Travis Browne, Eh, you know, people are like, Holy Fuck, you guys are your homeys what the hell happened? And it's just, there's, the thing was, is that Travis, uh, was, had tried to get in touch with me through a marina before, like, hey, he really liked, he really, really wants to talk to you. And I'm just like, ah, okay. I want what he wants to talk about. And this is like, uh, over a year ago I think. And then, but for one reason, the other, we weren't able to ever cross paths, but through that time it would keep coming back.

Speaker 8:          01:57:44       He really wants to, he really liked, he really liked to really liked to see you, not just text you, not just chat with you on the phone but actually see you. Okay. You know, that already says something to me that that already has a lot more meaning. And so sure enough, I meet up with them this, this one time with a coffee shop and he just wanted to sit down, man to man I and just go over like any of the beef that we had had and, and make his statements any apologies and, and anything that I might have to say in any apologies. And I was like, Holy Fuck, you know, a man, uh, I use man, I'm not trying to be specific, but any person that is willing to sit down and be accountable and hear somebody else's side and just show up and be like, look man, I'm not looking for something from you, but I'm trying to be open and deal with whatever this, this is out here.

Speaker 8:          01:58:36       Put it to bed. Yeah, that's very admirable. Exactly. It is such a rare commodity. And how long ago did this happen? Uh, maybe about six months ago. And he's got a fight schedule runs, right? Well maybe he's even a little more than six months ago. He's fighting a Alex Olynyk. And so he hits me up, he goes, Hey, I would love it if you could help me out. So for me it was a no brainer. Like fuck yeah, I'll be there. All right. So I drove out to vegas with one of my guys show, Hey Yamamoto who was getting ready for his, uh, the kill chain kid is fighting a locally here in cxf. So I'm like, I'm going to finish his kid's camp out here, away from everybody else and I'm going to help you out at the same time. Cool. Cool. So he put us up in his place.

Speaker 8:          01:59:16       Uh, we would go and we train twice a day. I would work with him on grappling. I would spar with him and, you know, just take on that role of coach alongside Ricky Lundell and Ray sefo and he's a fantastic student. When did you start working with ray? Uh, I think he's been working for, with ray for about a year now. About a year. I think that's a good mood. He's kicking again. Thank you. On knees, which is great. Yeah. Guy Six foot seven. He's six [inaudible] seven and moves like, yeah. How many crews and when he was not, sorry dominic. But I mean, when he was at his best for a heavyweight, there's no one who moves like him. He was, he's very agile on his feet. He's got great, great quickness, good a and he's got great reach, good power. Uh, hell I should know. And, uh, the thing is, uh, he, he was having, he just didn't feel that he was getting what he best needed.

Speaker 8:          02:00:04       So he made a change. And even still for fighting someone like Alexi, he felt that, oh, we'll having a guy that was a good grappler and also good at that head and arm position, which Alexi likes, um, to have someone come in here and work with him in these very specific areas. But, you know, for me it's like, well, if you want me to be here, I'll be here and I'll help you in any way I can. And so, uh, I would work with them while we're spar and we would do situational stuff. And, uh, you know, he was just like a sponge and watching him get better every day and having some other, uh, guys around to help and be bodies too, and ended up being great. It also is great for show, hey, because I was able to, uh, put him in a very isolated environment and keep his focus, so razor sharp.

Speaker 8:          02:00:47       And he went and knocked this guy out in 22 seconds who was undefeated. That's awesome. So, uh, so now it's, you know, travis is in town doing some press stuff and I'm going to try and link up with him as much as possible and just keep working with them. And the thing is, he's the guys like that. I mean, they're already physical. They already have fights under their belt. They already accomplished it with them. It's about nuance. So you're going to be like, as head coach, uh, there's discussion of that. Yeah, maybe just, I mean, but the reality is, is that I, I just need to do whatever it is I can do to help him and his team and be a part of all that. And you know, whether I'm a head coach or assistant coach or I don't, I don't really care. It doesn't matter what the title is, just you need to be in there in the trenches with these guys putting our heads together and helping travis be the best he can be as as a fighter and end even.

Speaker 8:          02:01:37       Then while through these training sessions, you know, teaching somebody about getting out of a move or teaching somebody about doing a move, but wrapped in that whole bubble is, okay, you're having a hard time right now. Yeah, yeah. Okay. That's okay because you're still moving forward. Don't worry about how difficult it is. Sometimes this is going to be hard as shit. Other times things will work just like that. It doesn't matter. The matter is you got to keep going. You've got to keep moving forward. You got to keep fighting and you got to keep working and you then went, you know, from, from one position it's like, well, you can't afford to be here at all. So no matter how hard it is, you got to get out, but you can rest over here. Or it's like a, you know, this, this, this training session was super fucking hard.

Speaker 8:          02:02:20       That's great. If you're not pushing yourself into your absolute exhaustion now, how do you think you're going to perform when it's at its utmost? So it wasn't getting that? No, no, no. I think it's just, I'm just throwing out examples, but I still about working with him on a mental level too, and getting his mind and that best state to then best use those physical capabilities because ultimately, in my opinion, mental is the most important aspect when it comes to fighting. How you approach this things, your mentality towards each individual skirmish within that, that fight that eventually leads to either your success or your failure and um, that is always, that's always the thing. It's like whether I could teach somebody to throw a kick this way or kicked that way or you know, there's always a way to make something work. You know? Maybe there are some techniques that are more low percentage than others especially, but there'll always be a guy that can make it work. You know? However, your mental, the way you approach a fight mentally is the thing

Speaker 2:          02:03:22       fucking thing. That is the hardest thing to hone. The hardest thing just to change over the hardest realizations to create is all in terms of how you mentally approach a fight, how to control your nerves or how to over fighting this out like as a book. Yeah, I do. I think about writing. I think about writing. I think in terms of fighting, I think about writing in terms of philosophy. I think about maybe doing speaking engagements, stuff like that. You know, talk to me about a few sat down and came up with like sort of a comprehensive step by step for, for young fighters they'll be like super valuable maybe, I don't know. I guess if you, if you come up, sure you could do that and uh, which of course is going to be just like you said, framework. Yeah. Give them tools to fall back on. If they're in a certain situation, this is something you can call on. This is something you can think about if you find yourself stuck. This is the mindset instead of just swimming out there freaking out and treading water and trying to figure out how long you do it for, have a very specific mindset that you adopt or that you take on when you're in a bad spot. Sure. And, and a lot of, uh, drills and things that I'll create for, for fighters are based on creating comfort and, and

Speaker 8:          02:04:33       charity to where things get to a point where you're not thinking about it anymore, but you're, you're so comfortable and in that moment, in that space that you can react and act easily the most easily as possible. And also once you end up in a position that is even, that is a negative to you, that is a detrimental how to then work your way through it. And still do. So with comfort, like I loved watching Liz Carmouche and Ronda is back because Rhonda states so, so calm that that's how she was able to work her way through it. Fight that arm off her head, keep in good position, and eventually work our way out of it instead of seizing up and possibly, you know, locking in place. And then Liz being able to finish that face locker, that show, what did you think about that? Kevin leak. He has a fight. I didn't watch it. Watch.

Speaker 5:          02:05:27       He didn't watch it. No. How dare you? I, I, I know I'm a fighter that doesn't really watch fights is a crazy ending. So I heard, yeah, Kevin Lee took ts as back, which is CASS's thing, right? Yeah. And he took his back, sunk the choke in guess afar off. He went palm to palm key asks, uh, like it was trying to gut it out. He says, and Mario Yamasaki steps in, it stops it before he taps. I wouldn't have done that. No one does that. Especially do it choke. It's one thing if a guy's arm is snapped and you see it broken and then you call the fight. Right. But this is not that. This is, and he's saying that he thought he went out. It's just a hundred percent poor officiating. I mean, I haven't seen any argument from anybody on the right side. I mean, on, in terms of, um, people that are either work for the UFC, trainers, fighters, even Jujitsu athletes.

Speaker 5:          02:06:18       Yeah. Everybody says, but I don't go out. You gotta let them go out. It's not great. It's not a bad thing. But, uh, you know, people don't know. It's not, you don't get, it's not like getting knocked out. Yeah. He could have been shut off being with two chicks. Yeah. It doesn't, it doesn't hurt you as my point for people who don't understand what we're advocating. It's not like let a guy get knocked out what we'd get knocked out. It's not good the way you get choked out. It's almost nothing. It literally is almost nothing. Pretty much. It's, it's, you're, you're next going to be sore. Yeah, for sure. I don't think, uh, yeah, I know Mario. I've known him for a long time and uh, he's made a mistake. And that's the thing, you referees are human. They all looked, it's a fucking very hard job.

Speaker 5:          02:06:59       He probably thought castle went out. He thought he saw here we can get, take a look at it here. Let's let play the whole thing back from the beginning, Jamie. So you could see that. I can only get it. Okay. Just, okay. Go from there. So He's get it. He locks it on the next year. He's got the plastic trying to kiss his fighting. He peels it off. And then Kevin Luxy Body Tried d trial triangle down tighter. I see it. Yeah. Yeah. Gets that palm to palm and look at this. See, he's fighting it off and look, he's not out at all. He's like, I didn't tap. What the fuck I didn't tap. I think that's a bullshit stoppage. And it's not, you know, look, Mario made a mistake, but it's a bullshit stoppage. 100%. I can't even imagine anybody defending that stoppage. No reason. Well sound like, because if you don't defend your that making that stoppage, he's crazy.

Speaker 5:          02:07:46       Well, I understand that but, but people don't want to, uh, they didn't want it to end. They don't want to accept any blame. Blame May, he's in, he's gutting it out. Yeah. He's, he's gutting it out, man. They look, people don't realize it takes a lot of effort to squeeze that palm to palm in particular using a lot of muscle. There's not a whole lot. It's not the same kind of leverage that you get when you do the, she, I see his hands Kinda, you know, around the area. But I mean you can still grab, you could touch the guy's arm. Yeah. Yeah. And they're, they're stiff. Yeah. He's still resisting and you don't have to, it's not like strikes where you have to have your hands up covering yourself, like to resist it. He can resist by just really flexing his neck. It's not smart.

Speaker 5:          02:08:26       And tyron Woodley had the best commentary on this, honestly. He was on that a UFC panel show and he's like, look, you shouldn't, he goes, you shouldn't be in that position in the first place. You shouldn't be defending it like that with your hands like that. And you shouldn't have let that guy get his arm under your Chin like that. All of those things are bad technique and he's dead. Right? Yeah, he's dead right. The whole thing is kind of crazy. I mean, yeah, but he took him, he took a beating before that. This is one of the things you don't get in the context of this. I think he was getting shellacked yes, cause Kevin Lee had his back and while he had his back, see if you can find that. Well, I mean I can see that he's cut. Oh he's been bleeding. He had his back and he was beating the fuck out of him from behind with his back. Just Bang, Bang, Bang. While he's back riding them. He'd beat the shit out of him before that. So He's probably stunned. Right.

Speaker 8:          02:09:14       I'm also of the of the sort that sees guys that are getting hit and the four point position turtle position, you know guys are swinging on him and they've got their arms up in their covered like often. A lot of times they're like, just keep letting it go. I you're not, you're not getting through. But reps will see like, oh, it looks bad when we're stopping. It's like, but he's not really getting hit.

Speaker 5:          02:09:32       I agree with you 100% I think there's been many fights. Were fights were stopped quick when a guy was covered up, but there's nothing else he could do cover up. What else is he going to do?

Speaker 8:          02:09:41       Yeah, the guy swinging on him, but he can't, can't land a successful, the only reason that guys flooring so hard really. I mean, well not the only, but the main reason is probably because he thinks the ref's gonna stop it exactly on that. He wouldn't put that kind of effort into it unless he's just completely losing his shit. Me and like, Oh fuck it change and he's not thinking about it. Which could come back to haunt him. Like I've seen a lot of times. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:10:01       Old, old, old

Speaker 8:          02:10:02       cool fights guys even in mount, just try on load on a guy and the guy survives. It reverses it and eventually he gets his

Speaker 5:          02:10:10       and it and it's done. You know, we got a car when Brock Lesnar. Yeah. Perfect example. Shane Carwyn beat the fucking shit out of Brock Lesnar for a full round. Got on top of them. Full mouth dropping bombs on them. Somehow or another, brock lesnar's survives. Take Shane down the sac around, submit some quick. Yup. It happens. You got to let fights play out. But I think in that situation it's, he, there's no for stopping

Speaker 2:          02:10:34       the fight because it's not like strikes like w there could be an argument where brock lesner is on the bottom and he's not moving enough and maybe some people are a little bit more cautious, might have stopped that fight. But there's no argument to stop that. I don't think that the fight should have been stopped. Uh, yes and easy to do a better job of not letting guys get under his chin. Yeah. What do you, what do you do about that? You're the commissioner. If you're the king of the world, do you do a contact contact commissioner? You, uh, I dunno. I kind of feel like you have to keep him, give him the win. It's hard to reverse it like that. It's a mistake that the referee fucked up for sure. He stopped the fight, but he stopped the fight based on a, and this is where I want to go against myself.

Speaker 2:          02:11:14       A very advantageous position that was as close to finalizing and finishing as you can discern where a guy's no longer defending with his hands. He's hanging in there. I mean, I think Mario fucked up cause he didn't let it get to 10, but he let it get to nine. It got denied. Yeah. Yeah. That's the thing too. He was so locked into that show. Can't take his victory away. I feel like you can't take Kevin these victory away. Me Too. Uh, it's just no good. They're no good that comes up that it's not good, but you give them an immediate rematch. I think that's the move. That's exciting. That's a good, yeah, I could see that. But here's the thing, you know, this is price fighting, right? Is there the interest all right there. Make it happen. I think through it and make it happen. Because you're going to mention the promoter's got to make money on it. Yeah. I think that's a good fight to have in Detroit because I think they're going to do a UFC in Detroit. I heard I'm scheduled to do as a UFC. Isn't Detroit having a UFC basically every night? Oh No. I think it's different. It's like a, it's more like a battle cade old school chunk already just hanging around with me. Like, oh, that's so sexy. Sexy to, he's riding him like a pony.

Speaker 2:          02:12:27       Most people have no idea. Oh, I, I have party with John Perretti. That is, I love John Proteins commentary. Oh, it's hell. It's, I just enjoy him. He's fantastic. I mean, and you know him, he brought a lot of a really good fighters to the world of him. And then he had a great eye for picking talent. He was the guy that find, found Andre Arlovski. He, uh, yours in Novia, Mario Sperry. Mari Smith. Mari Smith. Matt Hume. Yeah. Well, I was going to bring it up. Sakuraba like when soccer rob a fought Conan and the UFC, that was the first time we saw Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt gets submitted. Right. We were like, whoa. We thought they were in vulnerable. Well, and up to that and the fight before that, uh, he clips soccer up with a good shot. Sakharova drops in on a single and then big John Accidentally stop the fight, but then they let him fight again, which is the craziest fucking thing ever. Like they would never do that. Never. That's crazy. I forgot about that. That is a very, very, very nice randy couture beat Marie Smith for the UFC heavyweight title and his, his tights got torn so you could see his, his speedos underneath that that randy was wearing. And so when frank shamrock also beat Kevin Jackson. Yup. Armbar oh, it's been like 20 seconds. Which shoes on? Yup. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:13:46       Old School, man. I loved it. That was the first year. That's when I quit. I quit that UFC. I'm like, I'm not going to Japan. That's when I quit the back in the old days when I was doing the post fight interviews. Did we do on a back in the day on the uh, on like the graffiti brick wall? Yeah, we did something man. Yeah. Yeah. That was, um, you know what, when you won the title, I was there but I wasn't working for the UFC. I was just watching and uh, that was back when I was just a friends with Dana and I was uh, I was just going to the events and enjoying them. I remember watched you fight randy from like, I think I was like six feet away. I think it was like front row back in the day. Josh Barnett back in the fucking baby face assassin with less stars and a lot less gray hair.

Speaker 2:          02:14:31       Dude. I remember you fighting in Hawaii. Yup. Super Brawl. Yeah. Dan Severn and that eight man tournament that I won that had all those dudes in Abu Dhabi champion Rigo Rodriguez and uh, John Marsh. Uh, Travis Fulton. I think you only had like 115 fights at that point. How much does travis have now? It doesn't have like 305 snowing now. Something insane. Jeremy Horn. I always thought it was insane because he had like one 50 and then you find out about travis and everyone's got like a hundred does he? Yeah, I got a hundred victories, I don't think. Sorry. You said you've been doing a little bit of pro wrestling but no fighting. He had a very gray blurry line between fighting pro wrestling to put it charitably. There was like some, some, there was a couple that people had called it into question. A couple of the Katas in there. Mm. Yeah. Well it's amazing that he kept it up as long as he did, but that was because of a solid wrestling, you know?

Speaker 2:          02:15:23       Well that just like real serious competitor, you know, he had that competition streak that would allow him to continue to drive and, and perform like that. But as he got older, you know the wrong match ups. It could be a guy who never even heard of and it's like, oh shit. Dance ever just got shellacked. Yeah. Well, when you look back at your initial fights in mma, like in super broad and then entering into the UFC, which is like, when was your first fight in the UFC? What year? Uh, 2001 yeah. See, that was when I was 2000 not working with them yet. That was when I was UFC 28 yeah. Gam Mcgee and then UFC [inaudible] was Pedro Hazel 32 Assam Schilt 34 was Bobby Hoffman 30 slot. Pedro his or when Pedro his, it was Pedro. His, oh yeah dude. We showed a clip yesterday of Pedro, his own leg kicking some guy and making them fly through the air. Some journalists holds the pad on his leg and Pedro leg kicks him in. The guy's legs literally go upside down where his legs are above his head. He goes flying. He's such a cool dude, man. It's just like seeing him over over all the years. Training at his gym in, in Brazil. When I was down there, he can't pick me up. Uh,

Speaker 8:          02:16:30       picked up me and my accident. We, we went out there and train with this guy, a master late dial. Who is one of the, was this before or after your second fight? Uh, after our second flight. Oh Wow. Yeah, we were down there, me and my ex and uh, eh, we're down there to help corner Shana and her last fight in the UFC, it was in Brazil against a Nunez. And while we're down there, it's like, Hey, I, I still want to get in training. I don't want to train with all the that Luke delievery like catch derived guys that I can. And so yeah, what we trained with a master lay towel for a while and Pedro is let us use his gym and we would sit there and talk and I go, you know, one of the things about Pedro, I go, he, he taught me how to throw the counter right hand even better than than I had ever known.

Speaker 8:          02:17:11       And that pivot step and they hit it from the other angle because he knocked me the fuck out with it and it was so beautiful and the replay, like, I need to learn that. I got to learn that that's two. And Pedro would just laugh about it and he goes, oh, well, you know, you got me. I go, who gives a shit, man? We were too busy having fun. Would you caught him with a left hook? Right? Uh, I caught him with a counter right hand, did you over his Jab and I saw him stumble a little bit and I charged for it. And then with a running left hook. Yeah. Um, because I saw, uh, the window of opportunity to get to get in there, I'd already stunned them. Uh, and so to a degree I'm like, thanks Pedro. Thanks. [inaudible] the hardest leg kicks you've ever felt a cro cop, Cro, cop.

Speaker 8:          02:17:52       Really? Yeah. Wow. That's crazy. Well, I would, I would imagine, I mean, if anybody here, here's just a cro cop story. So it's me and Marco and Eric Paulson and we're training in Vegas. Uh, I think, I don't know if I was doing commentary on that show. If I was fighting pebble, not too low. Either way. We're training at this gym in Vegas and miracle came out. So we're rolling around and training together and have a good time. And, and I think I was fighting and so on, uh, Paulson's holding pads for me and miracles like, ah, do this with your leftover and said, all right, how about Nah, that's not it. No, no, no. Here, let me show you here. You hold the pads. So Paulson's got this full on typepad leather typepad and he's holding it for miracles, right hook. Since you know, we're talking lead Hook essentially, right?

Speaker 8:          02:18:40       So miracle was like, no, I want you to do this. You know, you're doing it like x is, I need you to do it like this. So Watch, oh, and he hits this heat, right? Hooks, this pad, this typepad it goes, it tears the straps off of Paulson's arm and it goes flying across the room and hits the wall and bounces off the wall and falls on the fucking ground. And everyone was just like, uhhh. And Paulson is just, his hand is still like this and he looks at me and he looks at a miracle and miracles and, and I just, everybody's just, it's just silence. Wham flat. But I am, I just went, see, I took that, that that's what I was getting hit with and I still managed to stay on my feet because I'm an idiot. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:19:28       Geez. I remember thinking, how the fuck is this guy? He's just at his best is just absolute pure like explosive power. Just just destruction. Yeah. Well, you know Bob Saps eyeball and he did one fight. Remember that? Yeah. Dude, he crushed people with, with those high kicks. He, his middle kick was so dangerous to me is middle and is locate where the most dangerous because I felt like you could, you could, you could see, you could more read the high kick, but if you read the high kick or if you were to two d to set up to defend the high kick, if he ripped you in your body, that's your ribs. Can we chop that shag heath herring versus cro? Cop were cro cop's kicking them in the body and cro, cop's Shin is like halfway to his spine. I think he was only one kick to one kick and it was like boom.

Speaker 2:          02:20:18       But it's when you see the penetration of that kick, you realize like that's insane. And he had a taekwondo background that helped him to be, but you know, a guy like that you could have gave him fucking, you could have had him doing anything and he's just going to be a beast. You know, he had just such ferocious, ferocious explosive power. I remember his stare down with vandelay probably the best deer down of all time. First Time vandelay got out, stared. No, he's vandelays like doing the crazy eyes and Mirko was just staring at him like a fucking evil predator. The two of them looking at each other. I'm like, I got to give that one to cro cop. I can't believe this. Well, think about cro, cop, Cro, cop that got that motherfucker was, yeah, look at that kick. Oh Fuck Jesus Christ. I mean that is deep into his body and right, right where his liver is.

Speaker 2:          02:21:04       That's a insane power kick. That's that left leg. Yup. And he was the first one to flatline vandelay to remember that when the head kicked vandelay because uh, I was, I was watching that fight because my next, cause I was going to go fight Nogueira after that. So I'm sitting here hoping that these guys beat the shit out of each other and he goes out there and just fucking crushes them. So now I'm just sitting here thinking, God dammit, that dude spent two minutes of beating the hell out of this guy and now I gotta go out and fight. Nogueira how crazy is the chin on Mark Hunt? He gets fucking head kicked. Fullon he goes down and gets right back up. Oh, there's an Ovi but here's the vandelay one. Climbing a ridiculous speed and power. And because of the fact that he had that traditional martial arts background, he didn't step before he threw that kick.

Speaker 2:          02:21:56       A lot of times he just threw it and you didn't see it coming. That one just goes over the top of the glove and that's right leg. Yeah, that's right. Leg Hospital. Left leg. Cemetery. Body. Yeah. Done Dude. Now that fight, I remember he hit Mark Hunt with that a couple times. Yeah. He just, well he dropped him with it. And one of the fights and k one k one fight. Not In the, and the MMA fight. Mark Hunt actually one that one. Yeah. Well that was my editorial to it on the chin. That doesn't a Guy Carwyn. No, wait, that's a raw waterman. Ron Waterman. There you go. Boink Minataro was one of those guys. It was almost like too tough for his own good when he was younger. Well that's why who acts kick. That's why when he got towards the end of his career, he was just getting knocked out left and right because he'd taken, he had lived on his chin for so long that he could no longer take a shot anymore.

Speaker 2:          02:22:48       And that's honestly, it's not that uncommon. Uh, Ooh. Fujita getting a need, uh, as he got a cooler, easy highlight reel that you forget sometimes how insane the highlight reel of Mirko Cro cop is. Well, people in the, oh Alexander in the UFC never really saw, they didn't see this guy, you know what I mean? No, he was in pride. Well, I still maintain to this day that like pride was some of the most exciting and spectacular fights in the early days of MMA by far. They agree I'm insane. Matchups and especially because it was a big percentage of it was the heavyweight division was a huge percentage of what they, and, and the stage that they set for us to compete on wasn't crabs and people's like talent super arena. It was fighting in front of, I mean, I was fighting in front of Pete like 40,000 people every time I went out there swishing, it could've maintained.

Speaker 2:          02:23:44       I was a fan of it. When, when I was even working for the UFC, I was always a big pride fan. I'm like, look, there's room for everybody. Of course, you know, and the thing is the people that were by having pride, it opened up eyes. I would always say like having another company with a different flavor. Maybe it will draw in other, other, uh, fans that wouldn't maybe necessarily be a fan of the UFC, but they liked the way that pride did it. And so that would get them interested in mma and therefore then they might also, okay, well maybe I will give this ufc stuff with tribe. Maybe. Well, I like this one fighter. Uh, so I'll watch when he's on, you know, it just, it expands the market. It doesn't diminish it. I think that's the same thing with bell tour. Yeah, I really do.

Speaker 2:          02:24:28       I mean, I think that what, what's good about Bella tours that they're developing real world class talent now, Michael Chandler, you know, Michael Venom page now rory is over there. I mean there's world class talent there. It's true. And uh, you know, he had mitre on fight fueled our, which you crazy man. You know, double knockdown gets up first and it's crazy. Crazy thing you can't, can't plan for. So a guy like fate or when you see him at this stage of his life and you see him getting code again, what, what are your thoughts on that when you watch that? It sucks to see that that's the case. I mean, I love Matt known to man. He's a, he's a great dude. I, I trained him when I can and I'm glad to see him get that victory. It's a massive victory fund as was I, but I'm a, I'm a friend and I had been a friend of orders for such a long time.

Speaker 2:          02:25:14       It's, it's, it sucks to see him not doing well even saying his name right. It's a big commitment. Yeah. It's like everybody else's fader. Yeah. But y'all got to get, you got your fancy Yannis, right? Like Dostoyevsky Fyodor Dostoyevsky not fate or, well, what does everybody say instead of dose, gift, Ski? I think they just don't say anything. They're like the d a f d what's the correct pronunciation? Dus Dose. [inaudible] Dostoyevsky Dostoyevsky Dostoyevsky isn't a weird hub. Languages like develop, like they're totally different kinds of sounds like, you know, English has certain sounds. Sure. Russian has these like very specific noises that you have to, and then you go to like tonal languages, Thai or Vietnamese. Oh, man. Or Chinese. Oh, yeah. Crazy. So interesting. You know, and, um, uh, Steve Rinella again was here and he had been in Guyana and they had these interviews they did with these local people that were speaking in their native tongue. And it's like this really strange ancient language. It doesn't sound like anything else. It's a really cool to hear. It's like, wow, you, this might be like what mayans sounded like. Ha. Yeah. Really freaky. Well, when I was at

Speaker 8:          02:26:27       Romania, they were some, some of the, I don't, I don't know the truth on this stuff. Uh, I haven't done the research, so it up to your listeners to go follow up that they were saying, the Romanians has said that they have found texts and, and, and archeological findings that would show a language that was not a romance language that still possessed words that existed in modern day Romanian. And that the idea that perhaps that the Romanian language was older than Latin. Oh. So, but they also had a, the also went to the, uh, the palace of live the impaler and in the middle of Bucharest, which was awesome.

Speaker 2:          02:27:06       Oh Wow. You got to see that guy's house. Yeah. Yeah,

Speaker 8:          02:27:10       that's all dug underground, uncertain. And so that, you know, keep it cool

Speaker 2:          02:27:15       for people who've lad the impaler was, he was a guy who literally put, put people on sticks and then eat in front of them. He would stick sticks through their assholes and I put them on spikes out their mouth and then have them all lined up around him while he sat down and ate.

Speaker 8:          02:27:31       He also took the, uh, the merchants or the, the, these guys that he felt had been,

Speaker 2:          02:27:38       uh,

Speaker 8:          02:27:39       he's cheating and scamming the we'll Aki in the, in the area that he was in in Romania will lock you. They're the people and really getting super rich off their backs in a way that they didn't have an option. And so he went and grabbed them, them in their kid, their kids are and would have them build. They were building the steps, uh, up to this, to the, to his, to his, to this castle or whatever. And if, if the, if the dad died, they would just take the kid and put them in its place. And it's like, this is going to get until this is completely done. You know your debt still exists.

Speaker 2:          02:28:13       Whoa. Jesus Christ. Brutal Dude. Brutal Times. That's the guy that Mary Shelley bitten all that. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Mary Frankenstein, but

Speaker 8:          02:28:21       they fuck's his name. He wrote Brahm Stoker. Bram stoker. Yeah. He kind of based it. A lot of it. Yeah. Yeah. Well, and also like the story go away, which is a undead creature in, in Romania, which is actually a really pretty funny Romania movie called sort of toy, which is like a, it's a comedy horror thing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's the name they use in that TV show to the strain. Oh really? Yeah. Yeah. They use that term a lot. Have you seen that movie, that show? No, I, I don't have cable or anything like that. I packed since I moved out. I haven't into my own place. I hadn't had time to really set up my tv and all that kind of shit. So you just live in like a wild person kind of. Yeah. Yeah. He got an email though, right? I have email, I have internet, I have my laptop.

Speaker 8:          02:29:08       So I'm, I'm do watch netflix like on the laptop, still watched like documentaries or something. I don't, you don't, cause I'm, I'm, I'm always out and about. I just got back from Seattle. Uh, I was in Vegas Helping Travis and with my fighter show. Hey. Uh, then I had to go to the fights for my guys show. Hey, an aga, they both fall on that night and corner them. Um, shit, when I was, I went to Japan and pro wrestled in June, but I was also there again in March. Uh, she, just a rambling man. Basically after the dissolution of all that I had been putting all my efforts into for four years, we got past that. Right. We moved, but this was, this was the very therapeutic, well, here's the thing, it's just like, all right. Uh, no matter what, you know, I still have a lot anymore, but we're not, we're not, we're just saying that, that, you know, it's just like a moving into, you know, I had all these things that I was trying to accomplish and so it's just like, all right, well, uh, since I'm not putting energies in these areas, then I'm going to take that energy and put it somewhere else.

Speaker 8:          02:30:13       I'm going to make, make use of it. You know, don't sell, pressed and sit around and get bummed out at life. No. Well, and your own advice, there's lots of shit to get bummed out about. Not even be beyond even that thing that we're not talking about your podcast, I wish would happen. Uh, I hate to say it, but Fox really dropped the ball big time on it and the people that were working on the podcast, uh, just completely shit the bed to the point of like, I had, uh, had Natto and Scotty Epstein on and we're sitting there 15 minutes before we're going to go on and just chatting, whatever. And then it's like, all right guys, we're going to go, we're going to fill now. All right, three, two, all right. Boom. Do our thing. Nobody even pays attention to look at the front of the footage and cut it from what's not supposed to be aired.

Speaker 8:          02:31:03       And then they just throw it up there. Raw Silver Song and I'd throw was being [inaudible] and we're all doing our stuff. And then I get this email and was like, Yo, what the fuck dude? You know, I'm, I do a character and they go, what are you talking about? I go look at it and edit it, edit it all. And there were stuff like, uh, hey, uh, I know you're going to be on vacation, but I'm going to do a on location interview with this bank. Odour I'm going to get it all. I'll get all the NP, I'll just send it to you. You can cause someone edit it. Oh, I'm off on vacation. I can't help put their fucking nobody there. There's zero, there's no one. So then I had to go and reach out to another friend and be like, hey man, do you have some time to fucking chop this up for me?

Speaker 8:          02:31:44       And just make a few edits. Yay. I could do that. And then put that up. And then it was another thing like, okay, well hey guys, if I'm going to do this podcast, I want to have music in it. I want to have bands that I know and love and whatever I want to play there who have rights for their music. That's a nightmare. Right. Well, so I said, do you have some legal forms that we can put together, some boiler plates that we can do and have this happen? Oh, we don't need it. You don't need that, it's just no big deal. Okay. So I go and I get the management artists, everybody's on

Speaker 2:          02:32:16       or is this person that said that this is okay. Is this guy a young guy that worked there, there, there was the not knowing anything. Was it like a tech guy?

Speaker 8:          02:32:23       I am not going to throw anybody's names. There were these two dudes, there was one guy that was like, uh, he was a part of the head of the division or whatever. And then there was another dude, it was a producer of sorts who I got along with. Great. But when it came to getting it all done, obviously fucking it did work. But the guy that was above him was unable to take blame for anything and uh, and own up to any like fuck ups. And so it wasn't like I was asking for much from them. I'm just like, well, tell me what we're dealing with here so I can know how to appropriately act. And then, you know, getting this, this whole okay about music's all right. So I go and I do all the legwork, get everybody to agree. Have my guest on, we play some music to start it off. We played music, you know, while they're there while he's there and I'm being an asshole Masha and around the room having fun and joking around. And then I watched the video of it and it's like silence the fuck I look, I'm just stomping around the room to silence. What the Hell is going on?

Speaker 2:          02:33:22       Oh yeah. Illegal wouldn't clear the music and like well why the fuck are we dealing with this now? When I asked you before we even did podcasts one before we ended the first episode, why did we not get that out of the way? Cause you told me we didn't need it and it's just like shit like that. And so we're, we're, we're now like, look, we're not even doing it for money right now. We're just doing it to, to, to, to establish a relationship. And this already gone sour. Stop you. Why do you, why are you doing it with a person like a network? Why do you doing with Fox? Because they came to me, you can do it on your own. They came to me. Listen, all you need is that phone right there and a fucking a microphone that plugs into it. It's like I use this one for a podcast that I did recently. This is not an endorsement. I'm just, uh, anybody who's listening to this, it's simple. This microphone right here, no endorsement and I have to say the name of it, but okay. It's a blue right. Okay. This microphone works on a cord

Speaker 5:          02:34:18       that plugs directly into your phone. You set that bitch up like that. He stick this in. Bang. Stick that in your phone. Press record. It's that simple. And I've done actual podcast that millions of people listened to with this thing that sits in my hand. I closed that bitch up like that. Put it back in this little bag, stick it in my laptop, could take it anywhere you go. It's, it works on USB. It takes no energy. Super easy to do. And then you just have to upload that somewhere and you could add, you could figure out how to edit. Simple stuff like that. Audio. Sure. You're not talking about like making records. You talked about anything, a simple audio file, you can figure out how to do that.

Speaker 8:          02:34:54       And I hear you there. I also realized that, uh, you know, for me doing a podcast mean it meant it had to be like the amount of effort I was going to put into it was going to be equal to the kind of product I wanted. So I started,

Speaker 5:          02:35:07       yeah, but don't get confused about this, right? No, I hear you there. You're there. The effort is in your mind and your thoughts and what you're trying to put out there and that's your, you're really good at that is what I'm saying, that you don't need some network. You just need an account with like Libsyn or one of these podcasts hosts, they upload it to itunes. That's it. You're done. You know, people find out about it. They like it, they get addicted to it. They start download to get more and more. You know what I mean? You're really good at this. To get connected to something like Fox and have someone who's non-motivated they came to me and it sounded like, all right, well we could probably monetize this in some way and exist during the fighter and the kid days, uh, early, early. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:35:45       See they thought that they were doing something and then now they've completely changed their tune there. They've decided to, the only people that they're investing their time and now are people they have exclusive relationships with their eye, their thoughts about the fighter. And the kid were, and Brendan shared with me some article that they were talking about him and where the fighter and the kid, they feel like road on the Fox name and then became really popular and then made it is a delusional perspective. I mean, they don't understand what happened. What happened is there is an entertaining show and two guys are really good. And then another entertaining show like mine has them on and then millions of people find out about it and then they go on other entertaining shows. Like whether it is, uh, uh, fucking, uh, Jason Ellis or whether it's whatever they're doing. Yeah. And then this buildup, the same thing that happened to Tom Sigora and Christina Palicki and Bert Kreischer and all these popular podcasts, people find out about them and they're good. It has nothing to do with Fox zero. Right. So he did was host at the end of the day day.

Speaker 8:          02:36:44       I mean, Fox isn't the one creating the content. Fox is the one that has, the idea is Fox isn't the one cracking the jokes, telling the stories

Speaker 5:          02:36:51       or it doesn't hurt, doesn't hurt. Being connected to foster that, it's definitely legitimate, not what they think it is.

Speaker 8:          02:36:57       And I even said stuff like, Hey, I want to have whatever I want on this podcast. I have no problem. I go, no, no. I want to have whatever I want on this pile. I want to talk about anything. No problem. There's no pussy farts with Josh Barnett, Pussy farts with Josh Barnett, if that's a, you know where we wanted to go with it. But of the things I said

Speaker 2:          02:37:15       to him, I go, Hey, I want to talk about the the the fucking insane Nazi, a cult division. I want to talk about all that crazy shit that they did and I found this guy who was an expert and we can talk about all the weird stuff and cult divisions. Yeah, they had an occult division, the Nazis. Oh, okay. You said it extreme Nazi. No, no. I said the, the, the, the extreme crazy shit of the Nazi. A cultivation. How they would go around trying to find the spear of destiny or the Ark of the covenant and all these, right. I mean, that's why we have raiders of the lost Ark and all the really cool movies. Would you have on to talk about that? Because I go, I'm going to bring this guy on to talk about this stuff and they're like, can't have Nazis on.

Speaker 2:          02:37:53       I go, no, no, I'm not. I'm not talking about Nazis. I'm not, this isn't, he isn't Nazi Holocaust history. You couldn't have a history professor maybe wrote a book on Hitler. Come on and talk about Nazis. Oh yeah. Yeah. You don't need them. You don't know what this was. This was years ago. And so after that was like all this stuff was, was adding up and I'm like, fuck man, this sucks. It's not even their fault, man. They're stuck in this old way and they think this old, which works for television shows they're old way works great for television show. They control the advertising. They secure the town. I don't know how much the shows, it was Fox itself. I don't know if the machine Fox was really paying that much attention. I think it was really just the main dude who was above who is in charge of this shit, who was fucking it up and didn't want to put the effort in and didn't want to, you know, it got to the noise from the last, the last podcast I did.

Speaker 2:          02:38:46       Uh, they didn't even put the video portion up. It took them weeks to, it's just like, wow. Okay. I guess you don't have any contract with them. Yeah, I could. I could still, people still hit me up and go, hey, we like you. You know, we'd love it if you do a podcast again. I'm just like, ah, just do it. Just do it. Dude, you're really good at this. It's easy, easy for you. People can get mad at me. They're like, God Damn Joe Rogan, you always trying to get people to do podcasts. I would listen to your podcast if you had a podcast. I listened to it all. I'm saying. Um, I, uh, I have, I have lots of things to talk about, but I do like to talk to a broad variety of people. I love the fact that you're bringing on guys like Jordan Peterson or Sam Harris or, uh, uh, God's sod.

Speaker 2:          02:39:29       Interesting guys to talk about interesting stuff. Even much as possible, getting the into scraps with crowder over here, which I'm like, oh, that's hilarious. Yeah. I like crowder. I mean nothing. I don't know. I do see him as like an aggregator or aggravator just kind of like, like Milo, like Milo might say something interesting, but then he's, he's couch all of this stuff and trying to like create shit with people because part of how they get a lot of attention and popularity, but I think he puts out funny stuff too, man. He, he did some funny things where he, uh, he's done a bunch of like funny sketches where he goes undercover as different people is, it's like a Communist, um, uh, French character that he goes on the cover as and no, no, no. Crowder does crowded. There's a lot of funny shit. People that get mad at me for saying he's funny. I think he's funny.

Speaker 5:          02:40:14       I think he does funny shit. He's uh, he's done some really hilarious social justice warrior things where he, uh, showed up at like some, well he definitely dressed as a trans person for a while. I was trying to like push the boundaries of what, what, like when can you decide that your transition, how do you know whether or not someone has decided that they're transitioning or whether or not they're hoax and you know, like, who are you to say with that? I'm not really trans. Like, so he went to like one of those a all women's gyms and said that he was trans and then they let him in at first and then after awhile they were like, what the fuck I'm, they kicked him out. I don't think it was an all woman's gym. In fact, I think he just went to a gym that said that they accept trans people and then when he went in and he wanted to shower in the women's room, but he was like, you know, I had like a fucking five o'clock shadow. Right.

Speaker 8:          02:41:00       So the idea is like, it's the sincerity of it is, is almost what that comes down to. Like, well you're not sincere about being trans. So is that what it comes?

Speaker 5:          02:41:08       But he's pointing out like how crazy these lines are. Right. And like where are they? Whether or not you agree that people should be able to do whatever they want, they want to, which I do. There is a real hysteria involved in this and there's something very odd about these arbitrary lines. Well, we decided, we had a guy that we were watching a video tape yesterday who identifies as a six year old girl. Oh, the German guy? No, he's, is he German? He's definitely foreign, right? They, it was all,

Speaker 8:          02:41:32       yeah, he had a wife and kids and all that. And then he's like, I'm a six year old.

Speaker 5:          02:41:36       Like what the fuck? But you have to include that. So then it's because then it gets to, well, can you be transracial can you be like Rachel Dolezal? Is that okay? Can you, I don't know why not. Look, everybody came from Africa originally. If you identify more with African Americans than you do, as I say, Polish Americans, why not? I don't, well, Ben Shapiro's argued that that's less preposterous than changing your gender and that like why can't you do that? If you can change your gender? Like why wait?

Speaker 8:          02:42:05       He's an interesting one because I like how hardcore and how like straight to the point he brings great arguments. Very smart guy. I can tell that he's that dude that just fucking, he's just, he doesn't hardly get along with probably with anyone. It just got me decided. Well, one of those, one of those personalities, it's just not good at socializing in any way. Like he, he's very rigid but very smart. Yeah. He's, he, he seems like a total prick, but an all right dude. In his own way, I guess. And you know what's funny is it's, I, I always, I'll talk to people about, you know, left leftism versus right as I'm, and I'm like, well, you know, it's pretty easy, most of the time to look at the right when they're being idiotic because it's so preposterous. Like, you know, theologically based arguments or you know, if you're going to, I mean, that's really what it comes to.

Speaker 8:          02:42:52       Stuff like that. Or, or like, um, how they will take this whole stance of like, no, you just, you get what you can get, but if you fucking fuck up, fuck you. You know, like the, these really extreme conservative arguments usually just are like, well that's not uncompassionate right? Yeah, I know what you know, it's, but you go to the left and it's like, everything is couched in this like, oh no, no, no, no, no, we're, we're good. This is all for the good look at how nice. Where it being like, well, you're just as fascist as this other guy, but you, you couch it into an under a different thing. You do things like use postmodernist, uh, philosophical arguments to then take the word racism and redefine it so then it works for your benefit. And that not only works against black people, it doesn't work against why people like going against white people. Yeah. People get weird with their arguments and it ultimately becomes a about control. Sure. Of course. And power is creating power for a person, uh, to, to affect that against someone else is in creating or it's also a creating moral high ground so you can feel as if you're in the right to say this or that. And because you are supported by all these other people around you.

Speaker 5:          02:44:00       Yeah. I tried a bow, I'm trying to balance it out, I should say, but people get mad at me when I have too many right wing people on in a row. They start thinking like if I've been accused of being like Fox News, I'm like, come on man, I have left. He's on all the time. She's not paying attention. Whether it's Julie Kedsey or Abby Martin or a w. What does it, Pete Holmes is a super, super lefty judd apatow. How's a soup and lefty he was on last week. I tried to have as many lefties on as possible, but they don't get mad at that. They only get mad when I have like super righties on when I have super righties on. Then they were like, oh yo, your shows like Fox News.

Speaker 8:          02:44:29       Well, culturally, you know, it's just like, well we can this, this, this argument will listen to you, but not this one of course. But at the end of the day, what really sucks is that when it came to, uh, you know, in such a, I had gotten so into a politics because of my living situation. I, as I'm looking at all this stuff, trying to understand the currents of what's going on, I'd find I'd have to go read like the most crazy leftist stuff and then I'd have to go find some gnarly alt-right garbage and have to go there and read all these preposterous arguments, racist, shitty arguments on both sides. Just ridiculous stuff to them because even amongst some crazy racist or some, some crazy, you know, communist, either way, there's got to be some truth there that they figure is useful to their argument that may be different from the other, but it still doesn't change it from being true.

Speaker 8:          02:45:23       It's like, uh, uh, you can't, the truth doesn't change from place to place. You, you can't, you can't change it anymore and you can salt salt, uh, said by Cormac Mccarthy and it's like, well I have to now go outside of this because I can't find anyone new sources going to be completely honest with me. So then I have to look and all these places and then try to piece this whole story together based on what truth I can find. And honestly it, it got to be so tiring and reading just crazy shit on each side and having to, it's just like, well, some of this stuff, it's just so fucking fucked up and it's not like I needed a trigger warning or something like that, but it's just, he's just gets tiring it. They didn't also think like people coming up with like, uh, racial Iq things, trying to create some, some idea there and I'm like, ah, fuck man, this is, people believe this.

Speaker 8:          02:46:15       It's like trying to to navigate flat earth shit and stuff like that and go, come on. I hear it. The first time I read it, I'm like, okay, yeah, whatever. You just don't get it. But then when I see that there's even some small amount of traction, it's just fucking disappointing. It's very disappointing. Yeah. Well, it's too easy to get by today and there's a lot of dummies that have gotten bots, right. That's one of my arguments is that this is the softest, easiest fucking way of living we've ever had. Now I understand there are difficulties, but are difficult. Even our poor are still more wealthy than like the 90% of the world or something like that. It's true. Crazy. Yeah. If you make more than $34,000 a year, you were in the top 1% of the world. Yeah. And we don't, we don't see it that way.

Speaker 8:          02:46:56       No. You know, we're too busy thinking about what we don't have or what we should have or what, how are we deserve more than this person or that person or how you know, you know, if you want to argue about the difficulty it is to buy a home nowadays, I'm totally willing to listen. If you want to argue about the, the shady aspects of banks, I'm there with you. You know what I mean? Yeah. But if you just want to start trying to cut me down into some specific class and minimal to minimize me and then devalue my opinion or who I am, it's just like I'm not going to, I understand the, the biological potential for tribalism and the fear of the thing of it is the unknown being maybe too much of a risk. So if you look at wild animals, they don't really get into fights all that much.

Speaker 8:          02:47:41       If they can help it, because the risk of being injured, maimed, or dead, potentially, it's just too much. She had, most of the time they get into their little scraps and they disperse, right? And if you're a full on Alpha, you normally don't get into any fucking fights whatsoever. It's the bait is always trying to like pick their way up and maybe eventually find an Alpha that's that they might perceive having a weakness. But once they finally get to that point that they're going to really fucking full on fight, it means everything because everything is at risk. Well, you know, you look at some cave people, it was probably the same way the first time. You know, uh, one group sees someone that looks completely different from them. They're like, oh, what the fuck is that? Can I risk it? Is it going to destroy my community?

Speaker 8:          02:48:22       Is it going to be damaging to, you know, it's like cave man shit because they don't understand until somebody creates an understanding. So, uh, but it's very hard for people to accept other people's ideas. Of course your ideas are different and then their ideas, you want their ideas to align with yours. And in the case where we're talking about with a lot of these people, they're trying to enforce or ideas on other people, you will now obey and go along with my standards of behavior and thought it's insecurity and it's fear. And, but to me I'm like, okay, I can understand that on that base element, but we have the ability to overcome that, to be greater than that, to be better than that, to not to not sit there and, and value people on all these surface level shit. You know? I mean you can, you could stereotype things all you want and be like, oh well this looks like a duck and quacks like a duck and this looks like it.

Speaker 8:          02:49:10       Goosing Hong, like whatever. Fine. But if you try to continue to keep people in these places, you're, you're diminishing who they are. You're also, you're creating this, this element of prejudice. You're creating those barriers for, for that to, not for that interaction to not happen. You're the one that's, that's helping create that, that tribalistic element. And so as you continue to widdle these people down in a more and more groups, but you know, with the, that now when you couch that in with this neo Marxist elements, it's like, well, now you need the more tiny or the group you get, the more you get to be oppressed, the more you're a victim of something. And so, yeah, them, it's a good market share and being a victim, we've got to get out of your mouth. I gotta end this Josh Barnett. So what's the future right now? No fights.

Speaker 8:          02:50:01       Scheduled, no fights. I am, you know, uh, actually I'm still dealing with my Usada stuff. Uh, we have to, my understanding, but my management saying is that you sought out to a completely satisfied with understanding that, uh, that this supplement that I took was tainted. And then we even went out and after they tested the one that I gave them, they went out and bought a whole brand new bottle on, opened, tested that one again laced with the same shit. And they had already, you know, they had tested me not even that, that much in between are they testing me in between like or there was barely any time in between test anyways. So my managers telling me that the guy at the lab is going, well this is such a negligible amount that it looks like you've been whatever you took was tainted in the first place.

Speaker 8:          02:50:47       So because there's no reason why a guy your size would even bother to have such a negligible amount of whatever this shit is and your system. And I'm like especially since two to explain that between the last test and this test, yes you would have, it would be such a small amount, right, that there's no way that you were on something and you cycled off. Exactly. It didn't make any sense. They have you suspended too. I don't know. The thing is, is that we've gone through, I've spent like two grand having supplements tested cause I would keep bits of everything that I would take just in case and keep him around. And uh, Christ, you know, and I, this was a brand I'd taken before. This was a, a supplement that had been an ingredient and other stuff that I've never had a problem with.

Speaker 8:          02:51:31       You know, I always would check everything against that global drove thing. I would do all their steps about cross referenced this, that and the other always. Okay. You know, making sure that I'm always on a towing the, are not toeing the line, but uh, being up front on this and doing what they said too. And then, you know, all right, so I got some, some bullshit and something I didn't expect. So, all right, we go, we test it. They go in a, they, they back their findings up with a completely brand new bottle and batch that matches the one that, I haven't acted on that and now I'm still waiting, but I, I'm

Speaker 2:          02:52:06       still suspended, but I don't, I don't understand. You know what, what, what more could I do? Right. You know what I mean? Right. All right dude. Um, Josh l Barnett on twitter and instagram. Instagram. Yeah. Thanks brother. Those was just fun. Always in here. You're going to do another podcast. You're going to start at the war machine chronicles war machines soon. I mean war machine. I say, that doesn't mean that when you more Master Sis Warren m, they just flow together so well fucked up the end of the podcast. Ladies and gentlemen helped me want to change major bummer war master. We give out a couple other nicknames, haven't you? Baby face assassin. What was the other one? Philadelphia. Jailbird. Josh Barnett. Ladies Gentlemen.
