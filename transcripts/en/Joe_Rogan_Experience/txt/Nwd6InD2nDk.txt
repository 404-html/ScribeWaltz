Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Well good already. Damn. I didn't even see a countdown. Jamie, you're so fast. Uh, thanks for doing this, mark. Appreciate it man. Totally. My pleasure. I've enjoyed your tweets. I've checked out your website and mark's Daily Apple and, uh, all of your, uh, the different rules for the primal blueprint. And I found this really fascinating because, um, it seems really straightforward. It seems like, oh, well this makes like eat lots of animals, insects and plants move around a lot at a slow pace, lift heavy, things run really fast. But what you've done essentially is created a guideline for optimizing your health and your body. Yeah. Um, you know, I've always wanted to be healthy from a really early age, like 12 or 13 and a read a lot of books. Uh, wanted to do the right thing. Um, tried to figure out the, the hacks, uh, before they were called hacks and got to the point where I was, you know, I was doing a lot of running because aerobics was supposedly going to make you live longer.

Speaker 1:          00:01:04       I was eating complex carbohydrates and a ton of them in order to fuel the aerobics. I became a pretty good a endurance athlete, but I fell apart, uh, as a result of the training and the result it turns out of the Diet. So the Diet was very proinflammatory as we say. So I started doing research into, uh, the ways in which I could re access this health that I was seeking from the early age, uh, and not fall apart and not be decrepit and beat up. Uh, and this became my mantra is how can I be strong, lean, and fit and healthy with the least amount of pain, suffering, sacrifice, discipline, calorie counting, portion control, and everything else. And where it led me was down this path of looking at human evolution and how we got to where we are today, how we derived this genetic recipe that we all have that wants us to be strong and fit, combining the research only in the last 10 or 15 years, uh, with the modern genome [inaudible] sequencing the genome and figuring out the actual mechanism of how lifestyle behaviors and foods and sun exposure and sleep turn genes on or off.

Speaker 1:          00:02:15       Uh, and they can turn on genes that make us a strong and build muscle. They can turn on genes that burn fat more efficiently, then say glucose. Uh, they could turn off genes that caused us to be moody and depressed, turn off, Geez, it might predispose us to, um, to get cancer. And when I arrived at was sort of a simple set of guidelines. He's 10 primal blueprint laws that not ironically emulate a human nature and human behavior for the first two and a half million years of our existence. So the genome was, was forged in this crucible of eat plants and animals, uh, avoid poisonous things, move around a lot. At a low level activity. Sprint once in a while, lift heavy things. Every human that ever lived up until 10,000 years ago did that every single day. And that's how those genes got passed along to the next generation to become us.

Speaker 1:          00:03:09       Where we've screwed up is in the last, certainly the last couple of hundred years, but starting 10,000 years ago with a agriculture, we went from being a hunter gatherers and moving around a lot to being sedentary and sitting in one place and uh, eating processed foods. Um, uh, not terry, not disposing of our waste. Uh, lots of, lots of little things that sort of conspired to make us a smaller and weaker and more susceptible to disease. So you were involved in triathletes and endurance activities which kind of break down your body. That's one of the big issues that a lot of people have with, uh, with that kind of training. It's just constant and brutal and that's catabolic. It's, it's, uh, you know, it's a, it's a great pursuit. I wouldn't take back my years as an endurance athlete. I was a marathoner in the 70s, and then it was a triathlete in the early days of triathlon and the, uh, all throughout the 80s.

Speaker 1:          00:04:02       But the training was a, it's devastating. It really does tear you down. And you, the assumption was at the, at the time that you had to put more miles in than anyone else to be one of the best. You had to, uh, you know, dial everything down. You had to work harder. You had to suffer more. It had to struggle more to achieve greatness or to, or to win races. Um, what we've discovered in the last five years is that it doesn't have to be that way. How crazy is that? That it's only the last five years? I mean, we're talking 2010, 2011. Yeah. Um, so you know, a lot of this, uh, this new paradigm is based on science. It's been brewing for 40 years, but it wasn't the, the findings weren't palatable to most of the athletes who are training. They certainly weren't palatable.

Speaker 1:          00:04:49       The coaches who'd had been invested in training a certain way, putting it a lot of miles, eating lots of carbohydrates, managing glycogen throughout an event, uh, which meant not only, um, carbohydrate loading the night before a race, but seeing how many gel packs you could slam down in an hour to keep the sugar burn throughput going. Uh, and that's certainly what my generation of athletes, uh, wound up depending on. And, and we all trained that way and it, and it was sort of, um, it was counterintuitive to think that you could learn how to burn fat as much more efficiently, that you could possibly go faster by going slower under certain circumstances that you could spend time in the gym doing heavyweights and have that manifest itself in a, in, in better endurance. So these, these later sort of developments that come out of the laboratory and come out of the clinical studies, you know, they were sort of interesting to the people who are reading them, who knew how to read the studies, but it didn't make it into the mainstream a training mechanism. What was the science based on where the, where people had used carbo loading carb loading

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       and using all those gel packs and eating a lot of pastas and stuff. Wait, where did that come from? Like what, what was the, the idea behind that?

Speaker 1:          00:06:05       Um, it was, that came from studies that they go back into the 30s and forties, but it was basically this notion that the body needs to burn glucose to go fast. Uh, that it, it was assumed that you couldn't burn fat at a high rate of throughput. And if you couldn't burn fat, then the only thing he could do was manage your glycogen. There's muscles can store four or 500 grams of glycogen Max, which is only enough to run 20 miles, let's say. Um, and uh, if you couldn't, so you, you had to learn how to manage that glycogen so he didn't deplete it in a, in a marathon for instance. So you'd hit the wall at 20 miles. So how'd you get through the wall? Well, you start to learn how to, I mean, gatorade became out of the science. The gatorade was the great first real performance enhancing substance that athletes used.

Speaker 1:          00:06:57       You could drink this sugary drink that had salt in it in a race and um, and then stave off that wall a couple of more miles. So for years, for decades, um, the science revolved around a continually try to continuing to try to figure out how to manage glycogen. So Tim noakes, Professor Tim noakes out of South Africa was the go to guy in this. He wrote a book called the Lore of running. It's a 900 page tome. He, he was the, um, the source that everyone's cited for decades when it came to carbohydrate intake and glycogen management and all of the things that had to do with fuel partitioning during an endurance event.

Speaker 1:          00:07:39       And about five years ago, he looked at the research partly because he was, he'd been a runner himself. He'd been employing this same strategy of carbohydrate intake and carbohydrate management. Uh, but he was a type two diabetic. He'd become, he had become, despite his training, a type two diabetic. Um, I think his uncle and his father had died as type two diabetics. So he, you know, he got the fear of God put it in him and he started to re evaluate the research and he literally had an epiphany. He goes, Oh my God, I've been, I'm the guy that's been promoting this way of training for decades and now I have to completely change my, my, my opinion on it and say, what I told you was wrong. And the body is developed and was designed to be a great fat burning machine and not rely so much on carbohydrate and not rely so much on glycogen or glucose.

Speaker 1:          00:08:32       Um, and the guy is taking so much shit for it in South Africa. They like trying to run him out of the country. There's a trial going on right now. Oh yeah. Here's a professor Tim noakes. And in my mind, that's the epitome of a heroic science, a man of science. He, he's gone down a path. He's dedicated his life to being the guy. And then he, he looks at the research and he goes, Holy Shit, I, I messed up. This is terrible. I, you know, I've been telling you the wrong thing and I'm willing to, to basically fall on my sword and tell you that because it's this new revelation is the truth. Well, that's how it's supposed to be, right? I mean, that's what science is supposed to be. It's not supposed to be relying on this bad information just because you've taught it to people.

Speaker 1:          00:09:19       It's supposed to be, you find the new data, the new data doesn't correspond with the old data. You have to let everybody know. I sound that it's like, you know, that's like Unicorn farts. I mean it's, it's a really, science is, is kind of dirty and, and uh, and messy and there are no black and whites in science. There's no absolutes. There no is no right or wrong answer. They're just theories and opinions going forward. And if you're a scientist who's had an investment in your life's work being one way, you're going to, you're going to defend that position even sometimes in the face of new new information that that really becomes a huge issue when they deny information just because it's bad for their ego. And just because it's bad for their career and they can just, I mean, he can, I'm sure have just kept his mouth shut and just coasted and everything would've been fine.

Speaker 1:          00:10:05       It, uh, well it would have been fine for awhile, but they, the coroner had been rounded. I mean, enough other scientists, uh, had, had started to look at this and I, you know, he, uh, he cited me as one of his influences in, in helping to turn that corner. But here's a guy, he was reading my blog posts and sort of, you know, having, uh, uh, a new perspective cast upon his information and was willing to look at some of the research that I, and Rob Wolf and a number of other bloggers in the new, in the emerging Paleo sphere. We're talking about that, that we are, um, we're born to, to excel at burning fat and we shouldn't have to depend on sugar. And in fact, the less sugar we burn in a lifetime, it probably the better off we are. So for the longest time when people were doing all this carbo loading and when they were, I'm just following the old methods, they were creating extra inflammation because of this food.

Speaker 1:          00:11:03       I mean this, the, the, the, when you're talking about simple carbohydrates, pasta and bread and such, they cause inflammation. Correct. So sugar is proinflammatory if you have high blood sugar levels that causes inflammation. And if you are, when you say that to people, like explain to me what, what do you mean by inflammation mean? Like joint inflammation? So, um, good question. So inflammation is a process in the body that's designed to deal with an insult. So he twisted ankle, um, and inflammatory process begins the, uh, the ankle swells up because a water accumulates there. The cells are being, uh, partly protected by the, the water, uh, white blood cells rush to it to try and assess the damage and fix it, repair some of the damage. Uh, there's a a long process where the temperature of the localized temperature of the areas raised. Um, all of this is contemplated to deal with a short term insult that hopefully over time it repairs.

Speaker 1:          00:12:02       Um, in many cases it repairs even stronger than it was before. You know, you break a bone. And sometimes that where it broke his stronger, um, or a callous is an example of a, you know, a stronger skin from having been irritated but the same. And we can, the same sort of process happens if you get a bacterial insult. If you get a microbial insult, you know, you get infected with somebody and something and uh, maybe by somebody and you get, uh, uh, and there's a, there's a reaction to that infection. Um, and it may happen in the bloodstream if, if the, if the bacteria goes into the bloodstream, then there's a, there's a response to that which, which is an inflammation and inflammatory response. Uh, now if you, uh, and by the way, a lot of this happens as a result of, of genes within cells being turned on or off based on signals they get from their immediate environment.

Speaker 1:          00:12:54       So genes don't work in a vacuum. Something has to turn the gene on or off. Something has to give the reason, the gene reason to build a protein or have whatever action. It's going to have. So when you've got, um, let's, so now let's go back to the food analogy. You've got certain foods that you can eat that cause the body to, um, to initiate an inflammatory us, what we call a systemic inflammatory response. It just, it just, uh, maybe emulate something that would've happened in an infection, but now it's caused by an over abundance of a maaco sits omega six fatty acids. So you're literally turning on genes that are causing a systemic inflammation. Now, over time, um, in, in the short term, not a big deal, one meal here, uh, you know, some, uh, some, uh, temporary insult, not a big deal, but over time, if your diet is such that you're continuously, um, presenting these sorts of foods that would prompt inflammatory genes to turn on, you get what, what is known as an inflammatory response.

Speaker 1:          00:13:56       Now, um, sugar has that response. A refined grains can have that response. Sometimes even whole grains because of the, uh, there's portions of the grain that we say are natural, but they're actually, um, uh, there, there's slightly toxic to the body. Uh, the industrial seed oils that are pervasive in our diet, that would be, you know, corn oil, soybean oil, canola oil. All of these can have the effect of causing a systemic inflammation, that systemic inflammatory response in the body. Uh, when, and a lot of times you'll see like you'll see it, you look at the biggest loser and you go, God, that dude lost 25 pounds the first week. That's unbelievable. How do you do that? How do you burn off that much fat? They don't burn off that much fat. They lose that much water because by re, by eliminating the proinflammatory foods, the inflammation, the systemic inflammation that was causing them to carry literally 30 or 40 or 50 pounds of excess water, that causes of inflammation goes away and the water goes away.

Speaker 1:          00:14:57       The swelling goes down. So you could look at the cause of heart disease. Heart disease isn't caused by cholesterol or saturated fat. It's the proximate cause of heart disease as we know it today is systemic inflammation. It's an inflammatory response in the, you know, in the, in the blood vessels. So when you, when you say someone looks puffy. Yeah. Like people who drink a lot of alcohol, they start looking puffy. That's lit. That's actually literally, they're, they're inflamed. We get water. Yeah. They're, they're retaining water as a result of an inflammatory response. The body is having. So, um, where we went to that from training, um, I don't, I don't know how we, how we get down that road, but the idea of, of eliminating these proinflammatory foods, um, oh, so I'll tell you where it went. I had arthritis in my feet at the age of 27, 28.

Speaker 1:          00:15:52       Uh, I had to smile this hard running and biking and from the Diet because I had this systemic inflammation, right? I had this diet that was promoting an inflammatory response throughout my body, not just in the ankle that I might have just twisted or whatever. Uh, I had, um, uh, I had arthritis in my hands when I was even into my, um, even after I cleaned most of my diet up into my forties, I had arthritis in my hands or my fingers that I thought was just a normal artifact of getting old. And the last thing that I eliminated from my diet was grains, which I found were causing, were a huge cause of issue for me. When I got rid of grains, the arthritis in my fingers went away. All grains, sprouted grains as well at zeal bread. Yeah, I mean, you know, yes, yes.

Speaker 1:          00:16:40       Let's, for purposes of this conversation, let's say all grains and then we'll talk about what that means over time. But I'm getting rid of all grains. Uh, I got rid of, I had irritable bowel syndrome most of my life that I thought was because I was a type a stress ladened individual. It couldn't handle it well. Um, and that literally that ibs had run my life. Um, that went away. The, um, the upper, upper respiratory tract infections I would get several times a year went away. Uh, I had lingering sinus infections after I'd have an upper respiratory tract infections that those one way and I, all these things I'd assumed were just a normal artifact of being human and getting older and part of life. It doesn't everybody suffer these things. They went away. And that was a real epiphany for me to, to realize it.

Speaker 1:          00:17:33       If I had made, um, I'm basically a researcher and if I had done all the research and still defended my right to eat grains in the, in the face of the research I was doing, how many tens of millions of people you know, might be effected by this. So, and I don't want this to an anti grain crusade today, but I'm, I'm, I'm sort of suggesting that a lot of what happens to us in a, in life, um, certainly a lot of the root cause of illness or the beginning etiology of disease, um, has deep roots in what we eat or sometimes more importantly, what we don't eat.

Speaker 2:          00:18:09       One of the things you said, I think this is really fascinating, is turning genes on and off. And for most people like me who don't have background in medical science and don't necessarily understand genes, the idea of genes being turned on or off by lifestyle, by a dietary choices, things along those lines. It just doesn't make any sense to people. They go, well, no, no, you got your genes so you don't got your jeans. You know, he gave the got red hair or you got big feet and that's genetic and that's it. No,

Speaker 1:          00:18:38       exactly right. So, so yeah, there is a huge assumption that the genes are finished when we're born. Right. You know, and then we just grow and we have our eyes and we're, we're, we're doomed to be 50 pounds overweight because our parents are, or we're doomed to get breast cancer because her mother did. Or, um, genes are at work every second of every day. Uh, rebuilding, renewing, regenerating, recreating us based on the signals that they get. So jeans are these little switches, it that cause the production of proteins that actually run our body. So it's a proteins. They make a that run our body, whether it's muscle protein being built or whether its enzymes to cause certain reactions to take place. And um, and the jeans, uh, are basically not doing anything until they get a signal from the environment. Now, the, when I see the environment, um, it might start from what we perceive as the outside environment, but eventually it's a biochemical signal, uh, or some sensation, some transmission of information that gets through the cell to the genes themselves and causes a gene to turn on the switch to turn on the protein to be built.

Speaker 1:          00:19:44       And that manifests itself in whatever that gene is assigned to do. Uh, so the beauty of the primal blueprint and the lifestyle that I've been promoting for 10 or 15 years is this notion that we can discover these hidden genetic switches that we all have. And we can make choices in our lives that direct us in a, in a direction of health versus down this slippery slope of illness and disease and, and falling apart. Um, they're, uh, they're not right or wrong. They're not good or bad. They're not black or white. They're just choices. And I'm not going to criticize you for making whatever choices you make. My job as a blogger and certainly a running mark's daily apple and writing the books that I write is to offer you some, some, uh, educated choices that you might elect to undertake based on what you tell me your goals are.

Speaker 1:          00:20:37       So, you know, if you say, well, I want to lose weight and I'm want to get stronger and I want to, you know, uh, maybe participate in a five k we can look at a number of different, whether their dietary and I mean they, the more the better because all of the strategy will have some impact, but there's certain foods you can eat that will cause you to become better at burning fat, uh, and will cause you to burn two to build muscle, uh, more effectively. Um, there's an amount of sleep that you'll get that will reduce the amount of cortisol that you secrete. Cortisol is an adrenal hormone, uh, that we secreted in response to stress. Cortisol tends to make us carry a little bit of extra weight, some of us. So if I can reduce, if I can increase my sleep and improve my sleep patterns, uh, and reduce cortisol, it all has effect an effect back at the gene level, uh, to, uh, to, to get me closer to where I want to get, want to be.

Speaker 1:          00:21:30       How much do you sleep? Um, probably nine, eight and a half to nine hours a night. Wow. Yeah. They say wow, because that's a lot or that's, that's a lot. Yeah. Um, you know, I have friends who, who brag about getting 10 and make no apologies for it. Um, and, and almost more, more importantly is the consistency of sleep. So I don't like to stay up late because I wake up early, I wake up the same time every day. So if I stay up late, you wake up six 30, you one of those, get out of the house and go run around. No, no, no. I'm a no. I, I sort of Mosey on down to the coffee pot, make a pot of coffee and read the paper and you know, I ease into the day and I typically hit the gym around nine 30 or or go paddle or whatever it is I'm going to do for the day.

Speaker 1:          00:22:13       I don't do it first thing in the morning. I want to be kind of refresh for it and ready for it. Um, but then we can talk about sun exposure and we can say, well, you know, so many people are Vitamin d deficient and uh, they've been that way because conventional wisdom has suggested that they stay out of the sun, that the sun is bad for you. That any amount of sun exposure is, you know, is going to cause you to get or predispose you to getting cancer. Well, what we say in the Paleo community is they're probably more people who have gotten cancer from having avoided the sun than ever got cancer from too much sun. And the reason I say that is because sun exposure, uvb light is what? That's the stimulus that causes cholesterol in the skin to convert to vitamin D. And vitamin D is one of the most important vitamins that she actually should be a hormone.

Speaker 1:          00:23:00       It's a, but at one of the, one of the implications is that vitamin D is, is strongly involved in cancer prevention. So the more vitamin D you have, the more, the less risk, the lower risk you have for most cancers. Isn't the issue with people sun damage though? The issue is no, exactly. So if you go out and get sun burned, and I've never advocated that, but, but there's a difference between spending a little, a little bit of time in the sun unprotected and going in and putting on a shirt or even if you want to stay out putting on some sunscreen at that point versus, you know, just uh, rubbing baby oil and us and a, what was it? Iodine. We used to put back in New England and there was very little sons. They had to get a cram for that. Suntan. I had dine.

Speaker 1:          00:23:43       Huh? I didn't know that. No, I did baby oil. Baby oil with iodine was even, it was like a, it turbocharge. It was like, it was like the, it was like the buttered coffee of Suntan Lotion. That's what that stuff is. Yeah. What's the mechanism behind iodine? Like how does that show? I don't even know. I don't even know. But that was the, again, that was the old wives' tale. Conventional. Okay. I went, I was worst burn I ever got. Um, uh, it was a winter break or spring break. I went to Williams college in Western mass. We drove from Williamstown to Fort Lauderdale, straight through, straight through, uh, in a BMW 2002. There wasn't great little car, great car. Four of us smell like a goat farm by the time he got down there and, uh, fell asleep on the beach at nine o'clock in the morning and then just burned to a crawl from zero sun exposure, you know, all winter, um, all the way down to Florida, all the way down the beach barbecue.

Speaker 1:          00:24:40       There you go. Wow. Yeah. That doesn't sound like it's recommended. Nope. Um, now just just to clarify a inflammatory response. So when you're eating grains, like say if you're reading a lot of pastas and things along those lines, what exactly is happening that's causing an inflammatory response? Your body's processing the, the gains. And so pasta, bread, um, a lot of cereals, especially the processed cereals, sugars, they, well, so, so those grains turn into sugar. I mean, they turned to glucose like really rapidly. As soon as they hit your, your gut and the body doesn't really know which glucose, it doesn't know the difference, whether it doesn't know the difference in a bowl of skittles producing the glucose and a loaf of bread, it's just, it's just glucose to the body. So if you raise that level high enough, um, you will have some issues. Now, if you, if you introduce high fructose corn Syrup, which is, uh, which is, uh, uh, you know, uh, frankenfood created in the 70s to um, to provide sweetness at a lower cost, uh, typically coming from corn, uh, now you've, you're introducing yet another variable, another agent, because a fruit toast in and of itself is, is a somewhat inflammatory.

Speaker 1:          00:25:53       So this is, uh, that's the, that's the, the glucose portion of what we're talking about here. But then some of the grains have what we call these anti nutrients in them, uh, that may cause issues with some people in their gut may open the gut wall and cause it to literally leak fecal matter into the bloodstream. Whoa. Yeah. So if you've heard of leaky gut syndrome, um, that's probably a reason why a lot of people, uh, have autoimmune diseases or at the very least a systemic inflammation. That's fascinating. And that's caused by your body processing too much glucose. It's not caused by your body processing too much glucose as it is. Uh, it's a side effect of it. Yeah. There's a, um, because it's not the glucose it's causing that in that case is now we moved on from sugar and glucose being a, a cause of inflammation to, um, uh, certain elements in Ho let's say whole grains that turn on certain genes that cause certain responses, one of which may be in some people to open the junction between the cells lining the gut and allow undigested food particles, shall we say.

Speaker 1:          00:27:04       Uh, to, to enter the bloodstream. Now the body sees those undigested food particles, which the gut is only supposed to really allow in a free fatty acid, simple sugars. Um, and, and, uh, you know, uh, amino acids, single peptides die, peptides may be, but if you get a large undigested food particle in the bloodstream, sometimes the body goes, hey, that's a, that looks like a bacteria. We better go get that thing and set up an or an immune response to it. So you get an initial form of inflammation where the body's just saying, look, there's some foreign matter in the bloodstream. We don't recognize it. We're going to kill it. And that's sort of bad enough in it, in and of itself. But if you, if you, um, if that continues long enough for some people, sometimes that, uh, inflammatory response that, that immune response, now it goes to look for similar molecules and it might see, uh, a, a Beta cell and the pancreas and go, oh, that looks just like that other thing. I just set up a response for let's go kill this. Or it might do it with, um, the, the, um, in cells and the joint, the chondracytes in the joint. And you may get rheumatoid arthritis as a result of it. That's an autoimmune response to body set up, setting up an immune response to itself.

Speaker 3:          00:28:24       So when you hear people talk about gluten sensitivity and you know, people are trying to go gluten free, do you think that a lot of, a lot of what that is, is the body responding to an excess of this glucose in the body, uh, excess of focus in the two different things. So the glucose is one thing that the sugar is, is what it is that from breaking down breads and Pastas or, or candy or cakes or pies or um, you know, um, snickers, whatever it is, our soft drinks, which is a huge issue, um, cause softdrinks or, or a large part of the problem. But gluten is a different, an entirely different mechanism. Now we're talking about, uh, a protein, a protein. It's a plant protein is folded so densely that there, the theory is that humans haven't had enough. Most humans haven't had enough time to adapt to, uh, the digestion of that type of a molecule. And as a result, uh, there, it causes problems within the lining of the gut. Right. But what I was getting at was the p people always talk about having gluten sensitivity, but really what you're saying is that a lot of what people are having issues with is these simple carbohydrates is like breads and pastas against, sorry. Sorry to be, that's just, there's like two parts to this equation, right. And

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       either part is kind of bad, um, and together they're kind of like, why would you do that? So, so on the, on the glucose side, and it's just unfortunate. Gluten and glucose have the first glu but they're not related. So, so on the Gluco side, that's the sugar, that's the, that's the thing you want to avoid. Partly because the, one of the other things that happens is even if you don't have an inflammatory response, it raises insulin. Insulin is a, is a storage hormone that tends to take every calorie you ate at the last meal in excessive what you needed and store it as fat. Now, if you're a skinny, uh, east African marathoner, then you're going to burn it off. But if you're a typical American eating couple hundred extra calories a day in the form of this sugar, you tend to store it as body fat.

Speaker 1:          00:30:25       And if you haven't built a mechanism to burn off the body fat that causes problems over time, that increases your risk for cancel, that, that increases your risk for heart disease. That increases your risk for type two diabetes. I don't think I have gluten sensitivity, but I do know that when I went, when I decided to go gluten free, I kind of quit it after a while, but I did it for about six months. My face got thinner, a lost body fat. I had more energy, I felt better. And uh, I attributed it. I was trying to figure out what it was, but I tried. I don't think I have a gluten sensitivity. I just attributed to the fact that eating all that pasta and breads and all those things was just giving me all this extra sugar, eliminating that from my diet made a difference and that, so that is the sort of the first line of defense for a lot of people who want to lose weight.

Speaker 1:          00:31:08       It's just just by getting rid of those, those foods, and I want to say limiting yourself, but you know, including meat, fish, fowl, eggs, nuts, seeds, all the vegetables, a little bit of fruit, healthy fats, oils and nuts. Um, you know, that's a pretty nice plate of food that you can offer yourself up. Um, as long as you get rid of the, the, the carbohydrates, the simple carbohydrates, you're well on your way to re reducing the, the excess body weight, which includes the excess retain water in the fullness and the face and all the things that we talk about. Now if you give those up and you find that you, that your joints work better or that you have, uh, you know that your immune system works better, you don't get sick as often, which is what a lot of people notice. Now we probably are looking at the fact that you might have some, some level of sensitivity to gluten and gluten sensitivity exists on a spectrum of no problem at all to I'll die if I eat it.

Speaker 1:          00:32:05       And you could be anywhere in the middle anywhere on that spectrum. I mean this again sort of the operative, a mantra here, no, no right or wrong, no black or white, no, no good or bad, just choices. But if you're a person who really wants to dig deep and kind of make those, those changes that are going to get you closer to your goal quicker, that might be a choice that you might look into. So there's no right or wrong, but there is a spectrum in terms of tolerance. Your tolerance might be much better than mine and some people just really shouldn't have it in the Diet at all. Whether some people can have a fairly good amount of it and really not have too many issues.

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       Yeah. We say what, you know, what can I get away with? And that's, that's sort of an interesting concept in and of itself because people, humans, you know, we tend to see what we can get away with. You know, you might save saves, this is, this is really good for me and, um, or this is really bad for me. I'm never going to do it again. But if I don't die from it and it, there's no consequences, then I'm going to take it right up to the edge and sometimes a little bit past the edge. So there are a lot of people who can get away with eating a lot more carbohydrates than others, even though they don't train hard and maybe not gained that much weight. There are a lot of people who can get away with, uh, with consuming, um, you know, Omega six oils and not get into that proinflammatory state as readily or as, or as quickly.

Speaker 3:          00:33:21       You just, you know, as, as Ronald Reagan said, you know, man's got to know his limitations or it was that dirty Harry, one of the both. But I think it was dirty Harry. Yeah, I think, I think Reagan restated it later on, but yeah, so, uh, I was reading this article yesterday and I talked about this yesterday in the podcast about this woman who, uh, she wrote this article about she's in her seventies and how her whole life people have been shaming her for being fat and she was sort of like trying to promote fat acceptance. And you know, and I, when I, when I see articles like that, there's two reactions. One reaction as, as, as a human being. I look at her and I say, oh, this poor lady, you know what a fucking shitty roll the dice. She's gotten life and she's been overweight her whole life feeling fat and gross and she's trying to get people to lay off her, leave me alone.

Speaker 3:          00:34:09       And she sort of, it's a very biased account and not science or exercise physiology based where she sort of describing all the various times in her life where people have said she's unhealthy. But meanwhile she's been very active and she like lists all the different things. She did tree climbing and hiking and all this different stuff. Right? Which obviously to a guy like you or someone like me who knows a lot about competitive athletics and like the uh, the amount of calories she's actually burning out versus putting in, it's probably skewed. It's probably fucked up. And I don't, she didn't really discuss the actual, what she was actually eating. She was talking about very bland foods and a thousand cars a day the doctors are trying to put her on, which is the wrong approach. Right? Absolutely. And it's really, when I, when I see things like that, I don't see a woman who's like 70 years old who's coming to accept the fact that she's overweight and it's no big deal.

Speaker 3:          00:35:05       And who, you know, everybody's got these, you know, ideas about body image that they're based on skinny supermodels that are actually anorexic. And yeah, I usually just leave me alone and I'm plump and I'm healthy and everything's fine. I don't buy it. I, I look at that and I say, this poor lady has been given a bad set of directives. She's been getting given bad information as far as her diet. And you don't have to be fat like you can, you can eat healthy foods and, and you know, and live a healthy life and your body would lose a lot of weight

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       just eating healthy foods. That's absolutely true. And so that, that brings us back to this, you know, this idea of, um, good or bad and, and judgment because you know, people self judge, people judge other people. Um, I have to be very careful, uh, when I look at people not to make that judgment. I mean, my tendency is to, is to say to myself, Holy Shit, I could, I could, I could fix that person or I could help that person. You know what I mean? And people resist that. Well, and I don't do it. I mean, I say it to myself because it's, it's pretty clear that, um, you know, you have to want to change. And, and we, we talked about what, you know, what can I get away with? Well, if I can get away with being fat and people still reasonably like me, then I don't have to do the work and therefore not motivated to do what it's going to take to get to that point.

Speaker 1:          00:36:27       Um, but it's, uh, uh, it's a, it's a slippery slope with, with talking with people about, you know, like what's the ideal body composition, right? It's, um, the ideal body composition is where your body says back to you, Joe, man, I love what you've done with the place. This is phenomenal. You know, you've lost 50 pounds, not you, but you know, you're, you don't get sick as often. You've got all the energy you want, you maintain it. Uh, without a lot of, uh, you know, dieting or anything like that. You eat pretty much, you know, how you know you're supposed to eat, but you're never hungry. That's your ideal body composition, man. And if it doesn't look like the cover of muscle and fitness or shape magazine, so be it. Um, by the way, I can get you to that point for a lot of people where you are on the cover of shape magazine or muscle and fitness, but it's going to cost and it's going to cost not in money, but it's going to cost and sacrifice and discipline and pain and, and hating life.

Speaker 1:          00:37:18       So, you know, the science can get us there, but is it worth the life? The, the main thing we do at the primal blueprint is we try to live an awesome life. So, so in fact, my tagline is primal blueprint live awesome. Living awesome means enjoying as much of every moment, every day as you can extract and the greatest amount of pleasure, whether it's movement, whether it's with friends, whether it's food, um, again, with the least amount of pain, but in a way that's sustainable. So it, it, it not only benefits you right now and today, but over the long haul, you're going to live longer. You can be happier. Um, you won't get sick, you won't tap into your 401k to pay for a $200,000, whatever, uh, operation. Um, it's about, it's about how can I enjoy life right now today, now back to the overweight person who's trying to, trying to get to that point.

Speaker 1:          00:38:11       And I, I see a lot of, you know, overweight people are quite happy I guess. Um, but I see a lot of others who are maybe hiding it and going, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm the jolly, you know, fat person. But inside I'm, you know, I'm, I'm the sad, whatever the sad clown. Um, you got to deal with that, that, you know, there's a lot of, and there's a lot of baggage. So some of this stuff comes from the, the changes you make in your diet. So there's a lot of easy things that we do. I can, I can write anybody a program that they'll love that, that says, um, you know, we're gonna, we're gonna have a buttered coffee for breakfast. We're going to have a two eggs and a little bit of Bacon. We'll have a salad with some salmon on it for lunch, we'll have whatever and they'll never be hungry and you'll start to burn fat and life will be wonderful.

Speaker 1:          00:38:55       And um, and sometimes they'll get to a plateau and they'll go, what happened mark? I did everything right. Well, you know, you went from, you're a woman, you went from two 25 to one 75. You know, you still have some work to do, but for right now you're at your ideal body composition because in terms of your body, the body, it's a survival mechanism. You know, if you, if we get to this, you know, this sort of, um, uh, secular, uh, or you know, discussion about life and what we're, what we're, what we're after. The human body is a vessel designed to carry two strands of RNA DNA into the, into the future. And it's a bizarre permutation of several hundred million years of evolution. But the bottom line is the body is, is designed to survive long enough to procreate. And that's, that's the reality of human and evolution and the fact that we live longer and we enjoy life.

Speaker 1:          00:39:48       This is all wonderful in icing on the cake. But from the body's perspective, your ideal body composition is that composition at which again, you don't get sick, you move around, great. Um, you, uh, you, you know, you can meet a mate, uh, you have all the energy you want. You're not hungry. So that's it. If it's, if you're a woman and that's one 75 for now, you get, you got to go. This is fabulous. I embrace this. I feel good at, you know, whatever. Now, if you want to get dropped the next 25 pounds, okay, now we got to look at refiguring that the diet out and adding some sprints in there and doing some, some little tweaks in there and we'll, we'll, we'll get down there, but it requires number one, um, I identifying an appreciation for what you've done so far to get to where you are.

Speaker 1:          00:40:33       A number two, it requires acknowledging any past insults in your, in your life. And there's a lot of stuff going on in the mind and the brain that wants to keep people a protected with armor. Um, whether it's, um, sexual abuse, whether it's, uh, you know, verbal abuse, uh, uh, some, you know, scenario that happened in childhood. There are a lot of people carrying a lot of emotional baggage around with them that in some cases, if you dealt with it, you know, in an inappropriate manner that might free you up to lose a little bit more weight. And I've seen this happen.

Speaker 2:          00:41:08       So when you're saying armor, do you mean in terms of like emotional armor or is it the body fat that they keep on top of them? Is it almost like a distraction or is it the food that distracts them? The overconsuming of food to sort of nullify the effects of the abuse or whatever trauma. It could be any of those, any of those and all those.

Speaker 1:          00:41:29       Um, but it's, I see it fairly, um, where people will, you know, do everything right and then hit a plateau and wonder what I need to get to the next level. And do you got to, sometimes you need to really do the deep work.

Speaker 2:          00:41:42       Yeah. Why, why? I tried to explain to someone when they try to gain weight when people are carrying, I want to, I want to put some muscle on. Um, I tried to explain to people that like that that is not an easy thing to do. And matter of fact, your body doesn't want to do that. Your body has a limited amount of resources and it does not want to spend resources created on this extra muscle. And in order to do that you have to be uncomfortable. Like this is the only way. And people say, Oh, I've been doing all this lift and I'm not getting any weight. Well you probably lifting not enough weight. You're not putting in enough intensity. You're not a, you're not eating enough. I mean in order you have to get your body to say, all right, this has hall wants to do dead four days a week now or squats or you know, he, he's doing all this heavy stuff. We have to adjust accordingly because the, the environment in which we're existing in obviously changed and now we are going to need a lot more muscle.

Speaker 1:          00:42:34       No, I mean, that's again, the nature of the human body is to preserve itself, to pass the genetic material along to the next generation. Part of that preservation is, I don't want to waste precious resources building something that I won't need, right? So, um, in, in a lot of people, how that manifests itself is if you don't lift weights, you don't have any muscle. So you have this lack of muscle, this lack of, of, of um, uh, of muscle mass. And you know, he said, well, what, what's wrong with that? I'm skinny. Well, you know, you could be skinny, but you could be what we call skinny fat, no muscle. You got a little bit of excess fat, you're memory, more prone to getting type two diabetes. But almost more importantly, if you don't train, and as you get older, it becomes more and more important to maintain muscle mass.

Speaker 1:          00:43:17       Um, people don't die of old age. They die of organ failure because they just, you know, something wasn't keeping up with the body. But the concept of dying of old age is kind of ridiculous when you think about it. So the typical old age scenario is you got a 75, 85 year old man or woman, hasn't done anything active for years. So there's no muscle mass. Um, and because there's no muscle mass and they haven't done anything active, the bones, there's no bone density. So the bones go, hey, I don't, I don't want to, I don't need to build a structure because this clown isn't going to the gym and doing anything to require it. So I'm going to, um, save resources, not build bone density. The muscles are not building bone mass. Now the heart's going, this is easy. I can pump blood all day at at 5% of my volume or maybe 15% of my volume.

Speaker 1:          00:44:06       The lungs go, Hey, I, you know, there's no, no requirement for excess oxygen. This, this clown's just sitting around in a chair all day or you know, watching tv or doing minimal activity. So the lungs, they sort of ceased to function at full capacity. Same with the liver, same with the kidneys. And as, as you go down this path, then one night you get up to take a leak and you trip over the cat and you fall and you break your hip cause of bone density sucks. And now you wind up in the hospital and you get pneumonia and you die because the lungs can't expel the sputum for the pneumonia and, and the heart can't keep up. So you maybe you die of congestive heart failure. I mean, this is a very typical scenario for a lot of people and it all goes back to creating a need for the body to want to change that.

Speaker 1:          00:44:56       Great. Um, Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston movie where, how dare you say that there you say that great. Vince Vaughn, Jennifer Aniston movie gnosis things ever. Sorry. There was a great line in, uh, in a mediocre Vince Vaughn, but you're the one I'm talking about where she, they're, they're having a fight and uh, and she says, honey, come help me do the dishes. He goes, no, that's all right. I'm going to watch the game. And she goes, no, help me do the dishes. He goes, Nah, I'm just, that's all right. I'm going to be over here watching the game. I just watched the game. She goes, come help me do the dishes. He goes, all right. All right. All right. All right. I'll come help you do the dishes. She goes, nevermind. I don't want you sh. He says, why? He says, I don't want you to help me do the dishes.

Speaker 1:          00:45:34       I want you to want to help me do the dishes. Oh, Christ. Right, so get a new chick. The so the body, the body, sorry about that was an arcane movie reference, but the boss, you got to give the body the body needs to want to change and you do that by using your, your brain to elect to go to the gym and lift weights or to embark on a, on a, a more rigorous and strenuous regimen than you had previously encountered. Well, changing patterns is very difficult for people. That's why New Year's resolutions are always such a joke because everybody, I mean, the amount of people that stick to those things that they prescribed on January 1st like this is it. I'm going to write it down. I'm going to January 1st from here on out. It's all salads and salmon and running up hills and then come February 13th for lucky fucking over.

Speaker 1:          00:46:26       So over your right, back to the same thing. So sustainability is a huge part of this, uh, of any program like that and that changing patterns. And that's what we like about the primal blueprint is that the foods are sustainable. So I mean literally and figuratively, the Diet, the eating strategy is a sustainable strategy. Rule number one is you never let yourself go hungry. You just, instead of eating a Bagel in the middle of the afternoon, you know, you eat a spoonful of coconut butter or something that's got fat in it that satisfies and you scoop coconut butter for a snack. Coconut butter, just butter. You know, like the peanut butter. Oh hell yeah. You just take a scoop of that. Not, but not coconut people just checked out. They're like, this fucking guy's, well, should we talk about the same thing? Coconut butter, I like peanut butter. That's the meat of a coconut.

Speaker 1:          00:47:09       It's like what's in an almond joy? I want to fucking cook. Like I don't want a candy bar. I don't want a god Damn Colantoni man. Okay. So you have to suspend disbelief a little bit here and a humor me, go buy a jar of coconut butter and try it instead of a cookie or whatever. Do you participate in any sort of intermittent fasting? Not really. And I'll, I'll tell you why. Um, this is again about seeing what we can get away with. And I'm pretty lucky that I can, I can get away eating what I eat. Now I have, on the other hand, it compressed eating window. So you could argue that I intermittently fast every day. So I, I eat from 1231 o'clock to 7:00 PM and then I don't eat again. So you don't eat it all in the morning? It's, no, there's no concept of the word breakfast for me.

Speaker 1:          00:47:54       I have a cup of coffee and that's it. So I'll go to the gym fasted, I'll do whatever workout I'm doing, whether it's a heavy weight workout or whether it's, I mean, it could be a leg day, could be, you know, uh, intervals on a bike. It could be a two hour paddle faster. You find that when you do that, that you have less energy than if you have like some fruit. The difference here is I'm really good at burning fat, so I derive my energy from stored body fat better than a lot of people. Not because I'm genetically gifted in that way, but because that's how I've lived my life. That's how I've orchestrated my eating strategy over the past 15 or 20 years. So I become, I wake up, I have all the energy I need. I don't need to tap into the stored glucose in the form of glycogen in my liver or in my, uh, in my muscles.

Speaker 1:          00:48:38       So you essentially have you follow a Ketogenic Diet? Yeah, but it's not ketogenic. So it's, it's a high fat, moderate protein, moderate carb diet. But I have enough carbs. I have maybe a hundred to 130 grams of carbs a day. Uh, which would be in, in, in no one's estimation would that be ketogenic? But I'm good at burning fat because I've spent enough time in that sort of low carb area. I've built the metabolic machinery to burn fats really effectively. So I'd probably, you know, I'm just going to suggest that I have a lot more mitochondria in my muscle cells then than other people do because of the restricting the carbs and restricting the sugars and forcing my body to become good at burning fat. How does that work? So how does that pertain, baby? Please tell me. So how does it promote more mitochondria? Well, when it's called mitochondrial biogenesis, so when you are, when you're born, you're born again with this recipe that wants you to become really good at burning fat and it very quickly you change the script.

Speaker 1:          00:49:37       So you, the parents feed you grool and oatmeal and why back and toast and whatever and uh, and pureed vegetables and you become very dependent on, on carbohydrate. And the body says, I don't need to burn fat because I'm getting fed carbohydrate all the time. And a couple of responses are, um, I got to get rid of this excess glucose because, uh, if I don't, it'll, it's toxic body shouldn't have more than, you know, 90 to 100. Uh, your, your blood sugar count should stay between say 85 and 70 and a hundred Max. Um, what does the number of, uh, you know, milliliters per desk deciliter? I forget what the exact number is. They're all over the place with cholesterol and blood sugar. But the point is that there's the entire amount of sugar in your bloodstream right now is probably the tablespoon, you know, five grams of sugar.

Speaker 1:          00:50:32       Um, so it's not copious amounts. And, and if it rises above that, you start to get into problems that sugar can interact with, with protein molecules and cause a reactions that lead to a clogging of arteries, a destructive, a destruction of, of nerve tissue. That's where the, the diabetic damage comes from. Just excessive amounts of sugar that are in the bloodstream. So you, so the body wants to kind of keep that level low. Um, and if you continuously feed it carbohydrate a all day long, if you're not burning it off, if you're not running 20 miles a week, there's a tendency for the body to store it, store the excess as, as body fat, uh, and over time. For some people that's a real problem. For others who can get away with it, not, not so much a problem. So we were, many of us are at grow up depending on uh, this carbohydrate as a main source of fuel.

Speaker 1:          00:51:26       Uh, and you know, you eat a carbohydrate meal, a high carbohydrate meal causes a surge of insulin because the insulin is there to take the glucose out of the bloodstream and store. Cause again, it's dangerous to have too much. Um, but the, sometimes the insulin surge is so great that it drops the blood sugar and then you get hungry again a couple of hours later. That's why there's these swings throughout the day. If you are a sh what we call a sugar burner. Uh, if you, if you try and look at a way, a different way to configure your energy, um, uh, sources. If you restrict sugar and restrict carbohydrate a little bit, you don't have to, you know, be draconian about it, but you start to create the need for the body to, to start to burn. Some of it's stored body fat. You say, well, the body goes well, if I've, I've got to save, saw my glucose from my brain because at the brain runs on glucose and ketones and I'm going to, um, and I'm going to, I'm going to learn how to burn fat more efficiently.

Speaker 1:          00:52:23       And in order to do that, I got to build more mitochondria cause that's where the fat burns inside the Mitochondria and explain to people what Mitochondria. So Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell. So every cell has, most cells have mitochondria in the muscle. Cells have lots of Mitochondria that are creating ATP, which is the energy currency of the body uses to move to, to live, to exist. What does ATP sound for a and triphosphate? It's a very, we're not going to get a biochem lesson right now. That's okay. But ATP is, this is this currency of the body and it can be recycled using, um, certain different pathways, a glycolytic pathway, which, which doesn't require oxygen. And, and, and one of the pathways is, is using oxygen in the Mitochondria. So that's a very important place to not only build more mitochondria, but improve the efficiency of the Mitochondria and how that happens.

Speaker 1:          00:53:15       And this is the elegance of this again, is it certain signals that you give the body by, by cutting back on the amount of exogenous carbohydrate you take in those signals go directly to the cells that say, I've got to make more Mitochondria. And then unique to every other organelle in the body. Mitochondria have their own DNA. Um, no other organelle within a cell has it, but Mitochondria had their own DNA and the DNA and the Mitochondria go, well, we better be more efficient at what we do. So you upregulate the mitochondrial biogenesis, the creation of more Mitochondria, and you upregulate the efficiency of the Mitochondria all done at the level of gene. All done through a signal that you gave by in this case, restricting carbohydrate. And it could be increasing the amount of, uh, of, um, uh, low level aerobic activity you do theirs. And it can be both. And that we talk about that in, in my new book, primal endurance.

Speaker 2:          00:54:10       Read your new book and I want you to mark down what he just said, like the time on the podcast. What time is it here? Like, uh, an hour and 10 minutes in or something like that. Three minutes and 53. That's it. Okay. Um, that's very important. I'd never heard that before. I did not know that your body can change the amount of Mitochondria. Absolutely. That's, that's incredible. That's just from restricting carbohydrates.

Speaker 1:          00:54:37       Well, it's, it's from a comp. There are a lot of things you can do it a certain forms of, uh, of weightlifting. You can do like what, um, you know, you, you could do, um, sustained a maximum power output stuff. So you know, you've got a dead lift. What are you going to dead lift Max of 500, which are dead lift Max jail, somewhere around there. Okay. So a little heavier than that. I'm Kinda Yo. Um, so you'd, um, you'd do a workout in the gym where you do 80% of your, of your Max, a se to 400 pounds, and you might do it four or five times and then rest a few minutes and then do it again, four or five times and rest a few minutes and do it again and do it instead of doing three sets of 10 of whatever it is you're going to do.

Speaker 1:          00:55:20       Um, you, you load this up, you load deeper and deeper into the fibers. Uh, to the extent that the workout's over when you, when you can only do one, you know, and, and you know, you can only do one. You don't even try to get the next one. The workout's over. And maybe it's, um, maybe that winds up being 15 sets by the time you're done, but you've maximally overloaded so much at a high, not 100% Max because that's, now we're talking about danger, danger, issue, but you know, you can do 80% Max and three or four. So that's one example of, of how we can, and then that'll prompt those muscle tissues to, to want to build more Mitochondria. Because if you probably heard, you know, a truly effective weight session causes you to burn fat throughout the day. Right? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:56:06       Well, it's one of the best ways to get lean. And it's one thing that people sometimes aren't aware of. Most people when they want to get lean, they think about cardio. They start doing a lot of extra cardio. I know

Speaker 1:          00:56:16       it's weightlifting that really makes you lean. Yeah. No, I mean, um, weightlifting and spreads nothing, as I say, nothing cuts you up like sprint hills. Yeah, yeah. Hills really do it. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:56:26       when you were talking about increasing mitochondria, like how, how much of an increase are we talking about?

Speaker 1:          00:56:33       Double. Double. Yeah. I mean, up to up to double. Wow. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:56:38       And what are the other effects of having double the amount of Mitochondria? What are the other positive benefits? It's,

Speaker 1:          00:56:43       um, you know, more energy throughout the day because now you're so good at burning fat and you have all this machinery to burn the fat, um, that, uh, you, you're hungry less often. And you know, it's interesting when we look back at, um, how hunger runs our lives. And again, if you look at the carbohydrate sugar burning paradigm, you get up in the morning, have the most important meal of the day. It might be a bagels and toast. Special K. Yeah, yeah. Special K, um, a glass of juice. Don't forget, tell you, you, I have that instant sugar water hundred and 50 grams of sugar before you, you know, before you head out the door and you're not even supposed to have 150 grams of sugar in a day. That's what I'm saying. Yeah, it was. Most people said what I'm saying, I'm saying you're not supposed to have more than I like one 50 is a max amount of total carbohydrates that I have in a day.

Speaker 1:          00:57:31       So sugar is as a minor minor subset of that. And then, but then, uh, you know, you get to work and 10 30 rolls around and it's time for a break. Don't break room, don't at somebody brought donuts today, shelly. Uh, and then, you know, where are we going for lunch? Ah, Skoda, you know, get a pizza or whatever. And uh, again, another break in the afternoon, they get home and you have dinner and maybe you have some ice cream or something watching tv. And the next thing you know, you've, you know, you've taken in six, 700 grams of carbs in that day. Well, if you're good at burning fat, the first thing that happens, you wake up in the morning, go, ah, I don't need to eat. Really. I don't feel like I need to eat. It's, I'm not hungry. And, and one of the things we talk about in the panel blueprint, if, if you're not hungry, then don't eat.

Speaker 1:          00:58:16       That's, these are the signals your body's giving you. And if you can get away with not eating, and when I say don't eat it, it's clear. It's important that we have to say, because I'm not hungry. If you're hungry, eat, but if you're not hungry, then Eh, you know, move on. Um, I did, uh, a thought experiment a while back and I thought, you know, it's interesting cause when I was, when I was in college, um, every one of my college buddies know me as Arnold. They don't even know me as mark. They call me arnold because when we were in college, there was a TV show called green acres, and there was a pig on the show called Arnold Ziff. And I could eat more than anybody in, in the, in the college I went to, including the football team. And so people would call me Arnold Ziff.

Speaker 1:          00:59:02       And so I became Ahrens, Arnie Arnold for most of my life. It's just because the amount of food, just because the amount of food I could eat. And, um, did you have a contests or is this, everybody knew. It's like you're going to eat that dessert. You're going to eat those, you're gonna eat that steak. You can have that. Um, but I was running a hundred miles a week. I was a skinny shit have weighed 30 pounds less than I weigh now, but I just, the throughput was, was where it was. And because I had a leaky gut, probably a lot of it just went right out the button out the button. So, um, uh, the thought experiment was that my whole life I sort of was guilty of this. Like how much food can I eat and not gain weight and not be uncomfortable. You know, that's, and I think a lot of people look that way.

Speaker 1:          00:59:46       It's like, all right, we're going to go eat lunch. How much food can I eat and a, and not gain weight or how much of that cake or that pie can or whatever. People I think tend to this is this is the, what can I get away with part of it? Well, what if you shifted that around and you said, what's the least amount of food I can eat and maintain muscle mass and maintain energy and, and not get sick and most importantly not be hungry. And you find if you do this experiments pretty interesting. If you become good at burning fat, your, your appetite. So self regulates and so mitigates that you find yourself pushing a plate of food away after a couple of bites or not being hungry or eating just the right amount of food to, to, to get you through the day.

Speaker 1:          01:00:28       What do you keep your body fat out? You know, so I'm 62 now and build. Great. Well thank you. I mean my people would look at me and go, oh, you must be six, 7%. No, probably nine, maybe nine and a half, maybe 10%. Um, a lot of people lie about their body fat. Uh, you know, you hear these stories of the wide receiver that's, you know, two and a half, 3% body fat. It's, that's not even possible. It's impossible. Yeah. Yeah. And, and even with the bodybuilders, the ones that, that get down that that lien are so close to death, you know, that's a, that's dieting down that the day before the contest to get there and they better, they pack it right on afterwards. So, so, um, yeah, so the body fat thing is, uh, I, I've stayed at this same V v visible I should say, um, you know, body fat level

Speaker 3:          01:01:15       since I was in my twenties. So this is a result of a lot of strenuous exercise, a lot of long distance running, a lot of the, the, the different things that you participate in as well as this body burning fat primarily because you're talking about if you've been in this same body fat percentage, most of your life do you haven't adjusted what usually happens now? So now forties when you adjusted your, you're done in my forties. So, so what happens now is I, I don't run at all. I was a career runner for the first part of my life and uh,

Speaker 1:          01:01:51       uh, I haven't run a mile. I have not run a mile in like 13 years. What do you do now for exercise? So I lift, uh, twice a week. I do an upper body sort of full, full routine. I don't separate, you know, chest and Tris and back and buys and all that stuff. I just do a full routine. That's a smart way to do it. That's separating stuff kind of malarkey. Well, it's at separating stuff as if you don't have a job and it's good for a body building to go to the gym every day and do two hours and whatever. But yeah. Um, I, I try to get some long, either a paddler a hike in once a week. Um, I do a pretty focused a interval ride on a bike, but half an hour once a week. And then my big thing meaning like a stationary bike, stationary bike.

Speaker 1:          01:02:33       And then I, and I go to the gym, not to ride the bike, but to catch up on our reading. Oh, okay. I read while I'm on the bike and whatever. Um, but uh, then the, the big workout for me is my Sunday ultimate Frisbee game. So you laugh like you get to some images, some pastoral hipsters barefoot. I don't even know exactly what ultimate Frisbee is. The greatest game ever been fed. Lucky you can always, you've got to get you out. Joe. Whole demeanor changed. Got his smile line. Your eyes lit up. What is all, what are you doing? Ultimate is just, um, it's a, it's a very fast paced game. It's played on a field like a football field or a soccer field. Two teams trying to advance the Frisbee down the field by making completed passes to their teammates. When you're a pastor, you can't, you can't run, but everybody else on your team is trying to get open.

Speaker 1:          01:03:21       So they're running, trying to get away from their defenders. You complete a pass and eventually if you complete a pass over the, the end zone or the goal line at a point and a, but if at any point in time Jamie just puts them on the board here. Oh, there he goes guys. Yeah, check that out. So yeah. So Watch, here we go. Yeah. So, uh, you know any, at any point in time, well they need some black people on this report because first of all, no, there's a white guy was running slow. She definitely got to that anyway. It's a pretty, it's a pretty athletic game. These are, I don't know who this is. This is a, I'll tell you what, they're not black. There is a good layout right there. Okay. Um, that was a good catch actually. No and we, but we have those every week that we played a bunch of those.

Speaker 1:          01:04:02       So it's a very fast paced game. And if you, if you lose the Frisbee, if it's turned over by your teammate, either drop it or something, it becomes the other teams, a frisbee going in the opposite direction and now you've got to get back on defense and defend the same guy that was defending you in most cases. Okay. So if you throw the Frisbee and the other guy doesn't catch it, then the other team gets it. Correct. And then it got to try and do the same thing. Interesting. And so you're sprinting a lot. A lot. I mean we have, you know, soccer players come out and basketball players come out and they go, dude, this is, I couldn't walk on Monday after that game. That's, that's just ridiculous. So you know, running except ultimate thing except you know, eight to ten second bursts. And how that, how that plays out for me is, um, you know, some of the recent research is you go, instead of doing intervals like the old days, we do 60 seconds or a minute and a half interval as a marathon, or I used to go to the track and do 16 times one half mile, you know, uh, at race pace.

Speaker 1:          01:04:57       So now we're doing all out sprints, 10 seconds, 15 seconds, maybe 20 seconds, but your Max, Max Max the whole way. And then, uh, uh, uh, sufficient enough rest and come back and do it again and do it six, seven, eight, five, six, seven times and you're done. That workout is over and you have accrued the benefits probably at a greater rate than would have had you done

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       the old method of training, which was to do, you know, again, repeat quarters or 200 or whatever. So do you think that a lot of what the old methods were doing was just as, as people getting through with mental toughness and you're, you're getting some benefit of it, but you're also kind of breaking yourself down too much? Yeah. So most of endurance athletics is, is pain management and overtraining. Yeah. It's like half the races that I was, I thought I was most prepared for. Um, I sucked in because I was overtrained I left everything on the training field. That's a big problem with fighters as well. With UFC fighters. It's a gigantic issue. I'm trying to figure out what is the right amount of work you should do. Yeah. And especially with fighters because in mixed martial arts or dealing with different disciplines, you have your grappling every striking give, putting them all together.

Speaker 3:          01:06:12       You have submissions, you have takedowns, you have a bunch of different things that you have to train as well as rigorous strength and conditioning programs. And there's a lot of debate as far as what should you put, uh, most time and effort into and some of the more successful people, it's really an interesting, have been going away from skill training during camps when they prepare for a fight and going almost exclusively to strength and conditioning programs with very minimal skill training where the strength and conditioning program takes precedent over everything else, which I find very fascinating. The idea behind that being you already know how to fight. So what they're going to do is get your body to a place where it can function at the highest work rate. And a big factor in that is maintaining a healthy heart rate and make sure, making sure that you don't overtrain making sure that you have enough recovery time, 100% agree.

Speaker 3:          01:07:01       Um, we, we say that in, in, um, training triathletes and runners here. You know, the amount of time you spend on the bike after you've been doing it for a couple of years, you know, how to ride. So let's train the component. Let's break the race down into its component parts. You know, how can you, how could you sustain your power over the next three hills to where your output on the third hill is essentially the same as it was in the first hill versus in the old days where you are 100% going over the first hill and at 90% over the second hill in 77% going over the third hill because you didn't, you hadn't trained that part of your, of your, um, in your, in your regimen that one of the things we say to endurance athletes is how many races have you finished where you were out of breath and maybe you had to sprint, you know, to, because you were neck and neck with some guy. But most endurance athletes don't finish a marathon out of breath because long ago their form fell apart. Um, their, their muscle tissue started to break down because they hadn't trained for sustained power. And so the, the, the aerobic part of it was like, feel we could do this all day long. You're just going slow because you didn't, you didn't train appropriately. So there's some strength training components like even to something like marathon running. Absolutely. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       So now we're, we're saying that the next, you know, the next breakthroughs in in marathon running will come from somebody who has, who has trained Quito genically and, and we didn't talk about that yet, but you know, has restricted carbs to the extent that they, um, cyclical. He, they know how to access ketones, which are a byproduct of fat metabolism and they can use the ketones in place of glucose or glycogen. Uh, they can use the ketones to fuel the brain to, to will them to continue the pace they've done the work in the gym where they can maintain a sustained power output over 26 miles and not have it fall apart and not have formed breakdown 22 miles into the race. Uh, and, and if you put all of these, these different component parts together, now you and do it with a, with an elite, a world class athlete, you know, now you look at, at the next level of records being broken, the problem is it's so antithetical to the way we trained for the last 40 years that you take, uh, an elite, um, professional runner who's already had some amount of success.

Speaker 1:          01:09:18       And you go, dude, uh, we want to shift everything around. It's going to cost you the next 18 months to adapt, but there's a good chance that you'll be better. The guy's gonna go, ah, you know, so hard for his. Yeah. And it's so hard. Well, it's so hard to, to give up something and give up something that's working right. You know, to, to get to that. Yeah. Um, I want to go back to something you said while you were just explaining that, that you, you get someone to train ketogenic. Yup. And what do you mean by that? So now you, there are periods of time when you're restricting carbs so much that you're, you're creating a more ketones, which are this byproduct of fat metabolism. So you've already become good at what we call your become fat adapted. As we say, you become good at burning fat and now you're building further metabolic machinery.

Speaker 1:          01:10:03       That access is ketones better. So now ketones, which we we refer to as the fourth fuel. So you'd have proteins, fats, carbohydrates, ketones are the fourth fuel, the body. Uh, we evolve to use ketones very efficiently. There was, there were times throughout millions of years of human evolution where it wasn't like you skip lunch, it's like you skipped last week eating right and you had to maintain muscle mass and maintain a thought capability and maintain speed and health, um, despite not eating anything. And the only way to do that was to access was to access the stored body fat that you'd stored from overeating or eating slightly more than you needed be at the last time there was actually food present, which is why we're all wired to overeat. And this ability to, uh, to use the byproduct of the fabric capitalism to fuel the brain. So ketones actually the brain loves to run on ketones.

Speaker 1:          01:10:59       Uh, one of the things that happens in particularly in endurance contest, and I suspect that happens in mma fights toward the end of the fight is, um, you know, you, you feel gassed and you run out, you starting to, to run low on glycogen and you're starting to, um, to really feel like the wheels are coming off. More often than not, it's a brain just is a lack of glucose to the brain. The brain isn't being powered enough and the brain goes a timeout. We gotta, we gotta, we gotta pull over the side of the road and take a nap. So it'll make you mentally exhausted because your body's running on glycogen and glucose rather than exactly. Exactly. So, so when you run out of glycogen and glucose, the old theory was, well, the reason that you hit the wall in any of these events are you bonk, as they say, uh, is because you've depleted glycogen so much.

Speaker 1:          01:11:46       The muscles can't function anymore. Well, the research now shows that you'd never really deplete the glycogen in the muscles. If you go from 500 or 600 grams total in the body, you never get lower than one 50. So there's always some glycogen laughed. So what's going on? Well, it's the brain and its lack of access to glucose that is shutting you down. And Tim noakes, the guy we talked about, professor Tim noakes at the beginning of, of the show here, um, he coined a phrase that the central governor theory of the brain, and he said, the reason a lot of people hit the wall isn't because you're out of glycogen. But it's because the brain as an override mechanism says, in order to prevent further damage, we have to stop. And, and it, it manifests itself as a system, as a sensation of tiredness and whatever.

Speaker 1:          01:12:30       Now, if you could find a way to bypass that, uh, and, and keep the brain going, because remember, it's, it's the brain running on glucose, uh, that once it runs out of that fuel says, um, I'm sensing there's no fuel, so we're going to pull over. So that's what ketones do. So when you become good at accessing stored body fat in producing ketones, and you've built the metabolic machinery, particularly in the brain, to use those ketones, and we know from history and from genetics and from modern science that that the brain runs really well on ketones. Now you founded a substitute fuel for glucose, so you can run out of glucose and yet the ketones will keep the brain, you know, revving and uh, and, and guiding you at the same pace again, provided you've done the, the work in the gym to maintain the, um, the form and the power.

Speaker 1:          01:13:23       Uh, and it's, uh, so you know, this is all, I'm going to say kind of theoretical now because the real world records haven't been broken yet. Some are being broken in the ultra events, the hundred mile run. There are a number of guys doing ketogenic and low carb training who are breaking records like crazy. I'm Zack bitter is a guy who in the in the lab has shown that he could derive 96% of his total energy running seven minute miles from fat. So, in other words, it's seven minute miles, which is like race pace for, I mean it's, what am I saying, race based sprint pace for most people. It's not that fast for a marathoner or even an elite runner and elite runner, but it's a, it's a substantial patient for, for a guy running a hundred miles a, it's a pretty good clip. And to derive 95 to 96% of all energy from your stored body fat or from exaggerates Fathi or eating and just a tiny bit required from glycogen or glucose. I mean I think 30 or 40 years ago we would've said not only was that impossible, that was like twice as it twice times impossible.

Speaker 2:          01:14:29       Well, the benefit of that for athletes has got to be incredible in terms of motivation, in terms of enthusiasm towards the end of the race or an end of a fight or something along those lines where your body would run out of the glycogen into glucose and instead you have fat to burn. So your, your mind doesn't drop off as much. Your mind doesn't hit that wall. Right. That should be she, I mean, that alone should be motivation for people to at least attempt to pursue that.

Speaker 1:          01:14:55       Yup. Now, when it comes to highly glycolytic, uh, experiences like mma and you know, you can't, you can't derive a us a substantial part of your energy from fat that's still has to come from, from glycogen. Why is that? Well, because, uh, there's a point at which, uh, your, your throughput of oxygen, you know what I'm talking about, endurance athletes, they're measuring their output over two, three, seven hours. You know, now you're talking five, five, five minute, uh, now you've got a, uh, you know, you got to that same output is concentrated now and you're going, um, at a, at a fairly high rate. Although, you know, I, you see them, you know, they're jumping around and dancing around and you know, moving back and forth. So there's recovery periods in there, but you still have to have that hundred percent intense glycolytic output. So when you're in a hold and trying to escape or when you're, you know, you're trying to defend her and try to come in for a barrage, you have to be at 100% of, of output, but it's brief periods of time.

Speaker 1:          01:15:52       So conceivably you could train in the gym to access that part of, of your body that Burns fats that Burns ketones. Um, you know, almost the most important part would be making weight. You know, if you, if you're look, especially in mma, it's about power to weight ratios to a certain extent. I mean, there's a lot of obviously skill, but, but a power to weight ratio. If I'm, if I'm, you know, 142 pounds, I don't know what the weight with the divisions are, but if I'm, if I'm carrying around, I'm at one 65 and I have to cut down to one 42 to get to my division. Um, I'm going to lose power. But if I maintain that power and I never, I never even get up to one 65 anymore because I'm not gaining fat because I've learned how to burn fat and I could stay effective and functional at, at, at the weight that I'm at that has benefit, you know, and it's a power to weight ratio concept.

Speaker 2:          01:16:44       You would have to have some sort of a hybrid diet then yes. In, in something like mma.

Speaker 1:          01:16:48       Yeah, it was so, so once you've built the metabolic machinery to burn fat and to burn ketones, it doesn't go away when you start eating carbohydrates. So you can, you can do what we call this cyclical approach where you spend, uh, in, in the early phases of your training, you become really good at burning fat and, and you do stuff that's, that's contemplated to, to make you the best possible fat burner. You can pay a, then you might introduce some carbohydrates, uh, the day before a really hard glycolytic workout. It doesn't, that doesn't turn off your fat burning. That doesn't even really negatively impact your ability to handle ketones if you do it for six weeks. And you do nothing but cars for six weeks, then it all shifts back again. Upregulation and downregulation of of enzymes based on gene input, a gene expression. But if you built the metabolic machinery and you keep coming back to it, then you can craft a strategy where you say, well, tomorrow we're just going to do, um, 100% glycolytic stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:17:43       It's gonna be be prepared to puke all afternoon or whatever. You have a, you know, 150 grams of carbs and the sweet potato that for dinner that night you topped off your glycogen stores, you're still good at burning fat. You have all the glycogen that you even could possibly have loaded if you'd just been a carbohydrate based athlete ever since. You just pick the, the times when you're going to up the ante with, with ex extra carb intake and you make sure it's not sugar, but it's, you know, a good, um, you know, a starchy carb in this case, something like a sweet potato or you know, yam or something like that. So how do you regulate the amount of sugars that are in your body? Do you limit the amount of fruit that you eat? Do you uh, or how do I, can you eat as much fruit as you like or is that not a good idea?

Speaker 1:          01:18:30       It's just not a good idea. It's just, it doesn't, uh, most fruit, some amount of fruit is good. But I think what, what cracks me up is number of people to say I'm on a, I'm on a very healthy diet. I'm eating a, you know, 12 servings of fruit a day and I go to Jamba juice and I get a big fruit smoothie and I go, dude, you're taking it more sugar than, you know, the guy is drinking two, six packs of coke. So even sugar that comes from fruit is not necessarily healthy. Correct. Now again, all these things exist on a spectrum, right? I might have blueberries every day because I love blueberries. Grew up in Maine, you know, picking them wild. So I love blueberries, but they're low in sugar, they're Tart, they've got antioxidants in them, and I don't overdo them, but you know, you will limit yourself to like a cop or something like that.

Speaker 1:          01:19:16       I don't even limit at look at for 99 a pack for organic blueberries. I limit myself based on budget, not on right on any other metric. Um, how many servings of fruit will you allow yourself in a day? Oh, just because I don't feel the need to eat fruit. It doesn't, it doesn't, I don't have a craving for it. Um, maybe made a, maybe two servings is the most elliot in a day. Some days. None. Um, but I don't, you know, bananas, um, some of the citrus fruits, some of these things can be way over done pretty quickly. And I'm not necessarily saying don't eat fruit. I'm just saying don't consider fruit the healthiest possible alternative to, you know, bread and pasta and then replace all of the calories you've got from bread and pasta and cereal and whatever. Don't replace that with fruit, but figure out a way, like vegetables for the most part are the ideal source of carbohydrates in our diet.

Speaker 1:          01:20:12       They're locked in his fibers matrix. Um, it's, you know, they're basically low glycemic index, so they kind of drip into the bloodstream at a, at a reasonable pace. Don't cause a huge surge in glucose. So celery with coconut butter would be a much healthier alternative than a banana. That's it. Again, not that healthy. Healthier is the wrong term. And we were making choices here based on what we're trying to accomplish. No good or bad, no right or wrong, but, but in a, in a, in a, you know, like in a perfect world, celebrate the coconut butter is a great choice. And a banana at the right time is maybe a better choice, like postworkout bananas, good choice. I mean, it depends on who you are. If I fast after the workout too, because that's kind of interesting. There's so much of, of these little nuanced science bits that you pick up.

Speaker 1:          01:21:02       And I've been in the supplement business for 30 years designing supplements for other companies. And one of the supplements I made a bunch of years ago, um, for a very large company today, um, was a post workout drink and everybody loved it and everybody thought it was the greatest thing they'd ever tasted. And it was in, it had, um, uh, you know, had it had carbohydrates and it had some protein. It had some creatine and it was great drink. But the purpose of the drink was to recover from the hard workout you did today. So you could do the bitch again tomorrow. And that's not how I train anymore. So I don't do two hard days in a row. So for that particular purpose, if you're going to train hard every day and you want to replace glycogen, then that's a strategy. And that's a choice.

Speaker 1:          01:21:50       If he say, well, we're going to do some hard glycolytic work today, we're going to, for whatever reason, going to do some hard glycolytic work tomorrow, then then let's have a post workout, high carb, relatively high carb, um, supplement because there's this window in which the body manufacturers glycogen refills glycogen stores at a higher rate, just workout. That was the whole reason for the postworkout meal. That's why people like to drink chocolate milk. Exactly. Exactly. But if you are, um, you know, so, so if you're going to go, uh, from day to day, then that's probably a good thing. Now, another strategy would be to go really, really hard today. Do a deep leg day and then fast. Well, what happens when you fast is you don't replenish the glycogen but you preserve the pulse of, of growth hormone and testosterone that happens as a result of the leg day, which we you would otherwise blunt by taking in a sugary drink.

Speaker 1:          01:22:47       Whoa. Okay. So again, these are, it's, it's, it's complex and yet it's pretty cool. The science is pretty cool. So, uh, insulin, uh, has an effect on growth hormone and testosterone actually lowers it. So if you are eating a, were a, a post workout meal that's high in carbs because you want to refill the glycogen stores so that you can do it again tomorrow. Um, then the postworkout meal will cause a rise in insulin, which will blunt the glycogen, excuse me, the growth hormone and testosterone pulse that you got from that workout. But you'll have glycogen stores slightly more ready for the hard work out again tomorrow. Now what are you trying to accomplish here? What what I'm saying is I'd rather just do the workout really hard, get all of the benefits, the growth benefits then looking for and not have to do it again tomorrow I want to work as little as pot I want.

Speaker 1:          01:23:43       If I want to do a leg day and Puke, you know because of it today I don't want to do it again tomorrow. I only working out to get the benefits. I'm not working out for the sake of working out. I'm not working out every single day because I just love to go to the gym and some people do by the way, and I'm not going to judge that, but if I'm working out to get the most amount of benefits I can from the work that I've chosen to do and in this case that includes my strategy post workout. That makes sense.

Speaker 2:          01:24:11       It does, but it's fascinating because I've never heard that before. There's a catch 22. So refueling the glycogen levels actually deplenishes though it blunt. Blunt is the best word. Yeah. Deplenishes I sent even a word. I like it. You make it up. Let's trade trade market right now to plan it. Just, I said it like it was real too. Um, but I've never heard that before. So there's, there's gotta be catch 22 in there then it seems like. So is there a negative effect of having those hard workouts more than one day in a row? And would you be better off in, would you gain more if you went the way you're doing it by not replenishing, I'm saying you do. Wow. Now it's even for an elite athlete that's competing in a sport like say mixed martial arts or something along those lines. Yup. Well,

Speaker 1:          01:25:02       it depends on what the game plan is for the week and what the game plan is to get you into the ring or to get you to the starting line. And in this case, if, if we say, um, you know, you're doing, um, uh, let's just use a leg day again, you know, you're doing hard legs, you don't want to do it again tomorrow. So there's no need to, to take the post workout drink because here's what else. The other thing that happens is if you have, if you wait a couple of hours, maybe you have an hour or two, you have a meal, but it's not even a high carb meal. It's just a regular meal. It's not high carb. It's not contemplated to, to increase glycogen stores, but within that meal and within the next meal and within the next meal, your body will riff. It'll replenish glycogen. Eventually it'll, it, it wants to do that. It's not, you're not preventing it from replenishing glycogen. So there's no immediate urgency to do it with a, with a post workout drink. If the meals for the rest of the day or the next morning have some amount of carbohydrate, some of which will go to replenishing glycogen. So you might wind up instead of having restored, you know, 275 grams of glycogen. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:26:16       Restore 230 big deal. What about the benefits of forcing your body to do more work to up your conditioning level and would that be mitigated or wood with some like what you will your strategy being too, not replenish the stores after the workout and to not have those hard workouts two days in a row? If you, if you instead had the hard workout when, through your idea of allowing your body to have its natural, uh, uptake of testosterone and growth hormone because of that hard workout, then giving yourself adequate time to recover before engaging in the next hard work. I would you in fact have more progress then keeping slamming your head up against the wall, which is at least with like, uh, wrestlers and for mixed martial artists, a lot of the time that's the standard operational approach is to beat your body down to be absolutely exhausted. And you think that's in fact maybe counterintuitive? I totally think, I totally think that is wow.

Speaker 1:          01:27:17       I mean, the, the notion that, um, and again this is during sports and, and mixed martial arts are, are very similar in it's about pain management. It's about, it's about managing, um, literally a pain and perceive pain, um, and a exertion over time. Um, so you know, to the extent that you can, um, that you can train in the gym in selective areas that all come together in the fight. That's a legitimate choice. But another choice and the one for the last 30 years is sort of the rocky Balboa choice, which is just go hard every single day and build up the cause. Maybe when it comes up, maybe it's the, you know, the fifth round and mental toughness, um, really comes to play there and you're able to dig deeper just because you know how to beat yourself up. So it's not to say that one's better than the other, they're just alternative strategies.

Speaker 1:          01:28:12       One of the greatest runners the country ever produced. Steve Prefontaine was fairly talented. He was not the most talented runner in the world. And, uh, and he would, he would go to the starting line and he'd look at some guy who was, who was clearly a more talented but hadn't had, they'd run the Sim similar times and Prefontaine would look them in the face and go, dude, he said, you may be more fit and more talented than me, but I'm willing to die for this. I'm willing to hurt more. And, and he was, and that's, he could dig, dig deep. And maybe it was a result of his hundred and 20 mile weeks of training and, and beating himself up every day. I suppose there's value in that in a sport where you know, from the time that gun goes off till the time you cross the finish line, you never sang to yourself in a marathon.

Speaker 1:          01:28:56       Fuck, this is fun. Let's do this again. You know, you never know if you're at the elite level, you never that, right? So it's about pain management. And there's, there's a legitimate strategy in maybe having some days where you do what I outlined and some days or some weeks where you do what you outlined is, are they mutually exclusive though? Like, here's the question. Like, do you have to beat yourself up in order to be mentally tough? Can't you be mentally tough just through meditation? I don't think you have to beat yourself up to be mentally tough. And the danger there is you literally beat yourself up, but the dangerous you overtrain and maybe that, maybe doing that and trying to force yourself into these mentally tough exercises is actually a form of weakness because you're not able to look at your body objectively. You're not able to assess it.

Speaker 1:          01:29:44       And more of a scientific fashion. I mean, I'm telling you, back in the, back in the day when I was doing training for marathons and triathlons, I defined myself worth as based on the previous workout I'd done, you know, and you skip a day and you feel like a slacker and hoser and a loser. Um, and, and yet, um, I, oh, I was chronically overtrained all the time. I wish I had those days back because, you know, I would have, I would, my career would have been extended. On the other hand, if I had him back, I probably wouldn't have arrived at where I am today through the pain and the suffering and the sacrifice, you know, trying to figure out how to fix that. Yeah. Yeah. Um, my friend Steve Maxwell, who's a strength conditioning coach, says that you should monitor your heart rate every morning and if your heart rate is over a certain beats per minute, it's over what?

Speaker 1:          01:30:37       It's naturally normal, five plus beats per minute. You just take the day off. That's one. That's one modality. That's one protocol. Um, there's now heart rate variability, which, which looks beyond what the heart rate is. It looks at the, at, at the time between the beats and suggest that if there's greater variability, if there's more time or there's, there's you know, 0.8 seconds here and 1.1 second here and 0.7 and 1.1 that that's better than having 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9. It's sort of counterintuitive because you'd think the heart, you'd want the heart to beat metronomically. Yeah. But if it's beating metronomically it's a sign of overtraining annually. Yeah. Yeah. It's a sign of, even if it's a low heartbeat. Um, so correct. If you wake up and you got 40 beats per minute, but they're all the same equal beats. Yeah. That's not going to happen.

Speaker 1:          01:31:26       It's typically going to be higher with if you've overtrained as well as having a metronomic interval to it now. Um, but there are programs you can get so you can wear your heart monitor and get these hrv heart rate variability programs and they'll literally tell you what the score you for the day till he's use those. I don't, um, primarily because, um, I have a premature ventricular contractions, so I'm, I'm now at 62. I've been doing this for 40 years. Um, actually 50. I started running when I was 12 a to and from school, just like that nut brown African lad, you know, with my converse, uh, you know, uh, sneakers on. And, um, so I've been doing this a long time and I spent so much of my career, stupidly, foolishly, my heart rate, heart rate out every day. So I've, uh, I've, I've written about this for the last two decades about how training for endurance competition is somewhat antithetical to health and certainly training the way we used to, which is accumulating miles and miles and miles in, in, uh, in, uh, at a heart rate that we call the black hole, which is, um, it's too high to benefit, uh, on a regular basis, but too low to, um, to create sort of the interval training deal.

Speaker 1:          01:32:47       It's, uh, uh, it again explain it in the book, but we, we spent years and years and years, decades training a lot of athletes at say anywhere from 75 to 85% of their max heart rate for an hour, two hours, three hours at a time. We'll, over time the heart responds to that and gets, it gets thicker, the heart muscle gets thicker and thicker. Um, partly it's like the heart can't, it doesn't have a say in it. So your brain tells your legs to run right in the heart goes, shit, I gotta I gotta keep up with this cat. So the heart's pumping away in, pumping away, in pumping away. And if you do this enough, day in, day out, day out, over years, the heart starts to get damaged a little bit. And in some cases it gets thicker. The ventricle gets thicker and thicker because it's growing muscle.

Speaker 1:          01:33:33       Yeah. But it's, it's, uh, it's not necessarily a good kind of thicker, so it's, um, it may be stretched, you know, too much. It may just not have, it may not recover. When you go to the gym and you say, we're going to do, uh, you know, uh, 200 preacher curls of 75 pounds, you know, you're, you're going to say, well, you know, my boss, well maybe your biceps can handle that Joe, but my camp. So, um, you know, cause they'll, they'll fry, they'll shred, but they feel it. You feel it. The pain is there. Well, the heart doesn't feel that kind of pain. So if you force the heart to calf to keep up and it's a demand Oregon, it just, it just feeds whatever the demand is from the body. Uh, and if that's held at too high a heart rate for too long, over decades, it can manifest itself in problems.

Speaker 1:          01:34:17       There's item, there's an epidemic of Afib, atrial fibrillation in my generation of runners from that very problem. So anyway, having said that, so I have the occasional premature ventricular contraction, which is just a couple of cells in the heart, maybe a thickness in the ventricle that misfire every once in a while. It's not, it's not life threatening. It's not, it's just annoying. But it, it, it makes my hrv look really good cause because there's big interval between beats sometimes, you know, but it's an, it's a false positive. Wow. That's fascinating. So you don't necessarily monitor your heart rate because of that? No. So you kind of more go on the way you feel. Yeah. And again, as you know, I'm at my, at my age, I just want to have fun. I just want to play. I, I don't, I'm not seeking to win any age group competitions anymore.

Speaker 1:          01:35:05       Those days are long behind me. It hurts too much. It, it's, it's too much. You know, I'm, I'm trying to extract the greatest amount of pleasure out of my life. So when I, when I go to the gym, it's pretty much contemplated to, um, to do as little as possible. That keeps me looking good naked. But also, uh, it keeps me somewhat immune from injury. It's a very honest of your brother or whatever, you know, a lot of, I don't even care about that anymore. Yeah, yeah. No, I still going to care about that until the day I die. But, uh, but, but, but for the most part it's about, um, it's about avoiding injury when I'm playing. So if I'm playing Frisbee, you know, I'm, I'm sprinting, uh, I'm, I'm keeping up with 20 somethings on a, on a long bomb run to the end zone a and then have to come up, turn around and come back and get them on defense.

Speaker 1:          01:35:50       Um, that, that, that has some cost attached to it. Some, some metabolic costs for an old guy like me. So the stuff I do in the gym is trying, is trying to keep me from getting injured, knock wood and uh, and then I spent time on the paddle for two hours and it's a best upper body workout you'll ever get paddling. Stand up paddling. Yeah. And uh, um, you know, it's fun and I don't think, Oh God, when's he going to be over? I'd think, Oh shit, I gotta get back cause I've got a meeting, you know, I'm out hanging out with dolphins and whales and looking down at fish and catching the wave once in a while. So I'm trying to, I'm trying to have, I'm trying to have fun. When I,

Speaker 3:          01:36:23       when I moved, when I workout, I did some, uh, paddling a few years back. I did a canoe trip down the Missouri River and, uh, it was, I was shocked at how tired my arms got. I'm like, this is like a legit workout. Like I thought I was in pretty good shape. I'm like, it's going to be nothing paddling St Shit. No, no, no. It's hard. It takes a good shots when w, you know, after paddling, and that's how I tr I treated it as a workout too. Just decided like, okay, we're doing this for a couple hours a day. I'm going to go hard. I'm going to just, I'm going to leave it all out there on the river, you know? And we were with some other guys who were under the boat. I was trying to kick their ass. So I was just trying to stay ahead of them the entire way and calling them pussies and yelling at them. Yeah. But it's great. It's lat work out. It's Serratus, you know, it's deltoids, it's everything. One of the big issues with a Jujitsu competitors and, uh, people just practice even as a hobby is, um, is a joint injuries, inflammation in the joints and um, and also spine injuries, a lot of bulging discs, a lot of things along those lines. Do you think that some of that can be mitigated by reducing the amount of inflammatory foods?

Speaker 1:          01:37:31       You know, you, you, you've got such a trauma based sport, um, maybe a little, you know, if you're, uh, if you're 10% less prone to getting the disc issue or um, or the joint, the joint pain as a result. But a lot of that is just the brute, just the brute force of the impact and, and uh, you know, that's just, that's a choice that you make to be in those sports. Well, I'm not

Speaker 3:          01:37:56       even impact like with grappling, a lot of it is just, it's just twisting and twisting and constant pressure and yeah, just the day to day grind. I think Jujitsu is one of those sports where a lot of recreational practitioners who get really addicted to it because it's really fun. You know, you're essentially, you're having a life or death struggle with someone and you can tap out and then go right back at it. And it's, it's very different than a lot of other, other martial arts in that way that you can, you can kind of do it a full blast, right. Whereas sparring, like kickboxing and things along, you really can't do it full blast for very long because the body just can't take it. The head can't take it. Especially. Yeah. Um, but with Jujitsu, a lot of guys are injured then they, they just wrap themselves up and kind of go back in where they say, oh, I'm just going to roll light and my next bother may just lay off my neck.

Speaker 3:          01:38:46       And I always wonder, like, is there maybe a dietary choice that could perhaps limit the amount of inflammation that you're experiencing after these brutal workouts? It depends. I mean, if the, if the, if the Diet is currently horrendous, then just probably some amount of, some amount of, um, of, uh, you know, uh, management of that, that could, that could be increased in pain management. Could be a little bit better and less inflammation for sure. But if the Diet's already good, then um, you're still, you're still putting the body through some unnatural torsions. I'm just amazed that we were talking about your hands and arthritis deep into your forties, that you were able to mitigate that just by changing your diet. It was so powerful. It was a, it was really, actually the most powerful thing for me was the ibs cause it, it literally ruined my life or ruled my life.

Speaker 3:          01:39:36       Um, but, but the arthritis thing was like, I mean, I play golf with friends and I was like, I can't even grip the frig and club the way I need to. Yeah. And now you have no bag. I'd meet you and I go, shit, is joe going to try to out bro, shake me, you know, and take roads, take me to the ground with, you know, with a, with a firm grip. Have it when they get the tips here. Oh Geez. All silver. Those tapes of the fingers guys were shit. I hate those fucks. Yeah. Um, so that's, that's very well, I'm very careful. Shaking hands too, because I know a lot of people with broken hands cause yeah, fighters especially like after fights you have to be real careful. Like I give them like the most gentle handshake possible. Um, what other, um, what other ways do you think there are dietary ways to reduce information other than a reduction of grains or, or elimination of grains? Know I say if you, if you get rid of the industrial seed oils, so you replace the soybean oil, the canola oil, the corn oil, and, and look at the labels of the ingredients because they're all over the place. The different, what's the different mechanism in the body as far as like the way your body processes s soy or corn oil versus coconut oil is the profile of fatty acids. These are polyunsaturated fatty acids. Sometimes they're partially hydrogenated,

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       sometimes they've got, they've been processed with, um, sort of nasty processing agents like a nickel. And, uh, they've been, uh, they've undergone enough alteration that maybe they contain some transfats. Transfats are known to be proinflammatory. Um, uh, the Omega six, by the way, Omega six in and of themselves are not, they're not bad. They're, there's Omega three, there's or make a six or nine to seven. There's 12. There's all these, but the three to six ratio is the one that's gotten the most pressable s decade omega three fatty acids that are found in, uh, you know, uh, fish, krill oil or fish oil, things like that that just supplement with fish oil a little bit. Yeah. Not a lot, but a little bit, um, couple of capsules, um, every other day. Oh, really? Other day. Yeah. Uh, and I, and I manufactured them too. I mean, it's part of my, my, um, my line of products, but because my diet is pretty much based on, um, uh, an otherwise healthy intake of Omega threes and more importantly, a reduction of Omega six.

Speaker 1:          01:41:54       So it's, it's not the Omega threes are by themselves. Antiinflammatories they are and Omega six are proinflammatory, but it's this ratio. Um, there's some requirement for Omega six in the body, but when the ratio gets way thrown off, it tends to be a pro inflammatory reaction. Where do Omega six has come from? That those are the industrial seed oils that we talked about. So there's a slight benefit to having some industrial seed. Well, no, no, there's a slight benefit to having omega six from other sources. So what are the other sources? Um, you know, any, any most, uh, fish. We'll also have oh six. Um, you know, they're, they're everywhere. They're in any kind of fatty food, um, nuts. We'll have them. Uh, uh, that's probably the source of most people on the Paleo movement get the Omega six from. Um, but yeah, it's, it's about sort of the totality of the Diet, not, and, and it's largely a result, again, of what you're not eating, what you eliminate from the Diet that has the greatest effect, not what you're reading. So when people say, well, Paleo Diet, I mean, I've had such great results on the Vegan Diet, or I've had great results on a, you know, in some Vegetarian Daddy, oh, well, you know, you're, you're not eating the same shit we're not eating. So the fact that you get your protein from plant sources, I'm maybe gonna suggest you could have more protein, but it's not that big a deal. It's really about what you've eliminated that that has the greatest impact on your health. Yeah, I

Speaker 2:          01:43:18       have conversations like that often with people that are Vegan. When they start talking about all the different things they eat, how much better they feel, and then I tell them, listen, I eat all the same things you eat. Like my diet is pretty vegan other than meat. Yeah. I mean, most of what I, like this morning, what I had, I drink a Kale shake. So I blend Kale with cucumbers and I know it's gross, but it makes me feel amazing. I blend Kale with cucumbers, garlic, um, celery, ginger and pear. I throw a pair in and a I that up. Oh

Speaker 3:          01:43:52       and a half a beat. I blend that all up and I had an elk stake. So the two things together, that's, that's what I eat. That's my lunch, you know, that's what I had. I didn't eat breakfast. I just ate lunch today. And how does it, how does the Kale shake tastes like shit. Yeah, it doesn't as good. One of my rules is, one of my rules is I don't put anything in my mouth. It doesn't taste awesome and it feels good man. I'm telling you, I eat that. I get this burst of nutrients I'm going to, I'm going to keep doing it. All right, well I'm not going to terrible with a full pair in. Yeah. You know, cause the full pair, I mean so big Bartlett, pear, a little bit of garlic. Very, yeah, it's very sweet. Yeah. But is that too much sugar?

Speaker 3:          01:44:31       That one pair? It's, it depends on how much, what your sugar load is over the course of a day. If that's, if that's the only sugar you get. Pairs are pretty high and you know, they're pretty high in sugar. But um, if the whole pair, I don't think I eat a pear before yoga class too. That's what I was, that that gets me through a yoga class cause I got pairs. Your favorite fruit or something like pears. Wow. Is that okay for you? It's totally good. I just get the first, first guy I've known it's favorite fruit as a payer. Really. I mean I like a pair, but I said, ah, I like mangoes. Mangoes are my also favorite. Those are awesome. Yeah, I, I'd take sliced so I'll do that. What would we be better? Pears and mangoes, I guess. No difference. Difference, difference. But fruit is what I usually choose before I work out.

Speaker 3:          01:45:12       But now I'm thinking that maybe fruit is a little too high in sugar listening to you or I should limit the amount of it I have in a day. And again, if you, if, if you like where you're at and everything's good and life is wonderful and you enjoy it, then I'm not going to tell you to stop doing it. Well, I'm all about optimize them. I mean, I, um, if I can chug down those Kale shakes, I'm obviously willing to eat some horrible shit to feel better. Um, this is not, it's not that horrible. I, I kind of exaggerate a little bit how my tolerance for gross food is pretty high. I can, I can, I can eat it. Jerry eat any of that shit on fear factor? Yeah, I hit a bunch of good, good. I uh, I balls, sheeps, eyeballs. I super worms.

Speaker 3:          01:45:51       Those, those worms, they use a on cadavers cleanup bones. Yeah. I ate a tomato hornworms it was pretty gross. I ate a Madagascar hissing cockroaches. That was the one that was at, that's the one I think it would have drawn the line in. That one was the easiest to do. Yup. Yeah. It's all psychological but that's chewy. But it's very mild. Like it has almost no flavor. It was all just in your head. That was no big deal at all. The really hard things to eat. It's really interesting. The smells were probably the hardest part and a big factor in the smell was the um, he would add this really expensive cheese. They would go to this beverly hills. What is up for module? What is it? One of those fucking places called where they sell the cheese for Masuri. Anyway, it was a very expensive type of French cheese that just smells like fucking death because cheese, a big part of what makes a cheese fragrant or interesting is the culture, which is actually bacteria.

Speaker 3:          01:46:51       Yeah. So we would buy this bacteria laden cheese that smelled so fucking bad. They would take it and they would open the little cup, the little plastic tub in front of me and sticking from, oh. They'd be like, dude, that shit is expensive. Really expensive. And we would throw that into like a blender full of maggots and that's what would make it disgusting. The maggots on the, on their own. That's really didn't have that much of a smell or taste. Yeah. It's more psychological than it is anything. Yeah. A lot of stuff on fear factor. And then there was a lot of, it was just the sheer volume. Like they would have to drink, you know, a gigantic blender, phil with his horrible shit. And there's the amount of mass that you're putting in your body and you have like three minutes to do it or whatever and keep it down and keep it down.

Speaker 3:          01:47:39       Yeah. Yeah. I think we gave them like they had to keep it down for like 30 seconds or something like that. So that at the end of that 30 seconds they would sprint towards everybody hurl. Oh yeah. I saw more people. I probably seen more people throw up then like a very small percentage of the population than most ers. Right? Yeah. Well maybe ers would have me like nightclub bouncers might have me, if you, if you put in 20 years as a nightclub bouncer, you'd probably see more people puke than me because you're seeing it every night. Maybe it was only one day a week. Yeah. But one day a week I'd watch it at least two people just fucking hurl. Just raw projectile vomit. Yeah. But, uh, again, more psychological than anything, you know, the, uh, the actual taste of those things, especially the roach was nothing.

Speaker 3:          01:48:26       It's like really no big deal. Like if I was, was, I was starving somewhere and I found like a, a big batch of a hissing cockroaches, those Madagascar ones, I would definitely scoop those up and eat them. Well, you know, um, uh, there's a, a bar company called Xo that makes their bars out of cricket protein and I'm an investor in their company there and I'm fascinated by the concept that, that uh, you know, billion and a half, 2 billion people around the world eat insects all the time and think nothing of it. Yeah, well that's what a lobster is. One of the things that we found out when we did fear factor was if you have an allergy to shellfish, you also have an allergy to roaches. We found that out the hard way because a guy who listed shellfish as an allergy, eight, a roach and got really sick and we had to take him to the Er, they got to give him an adrenaline shot, the whole deal.

Speaker 3:          01:49:13       So the, the enzymes apparently are very similar, but you can eat those bugs and there's the very high in protein and very good for you. And they can also be an excellent source of protein for a inexpensive source of protein. For a lot of people it's the cricket thing is very sustainable. It's like 20 times less resources, fewer resources to, to an equivalent amount of, uh, of steak and also equivalent amount of amino acids. It's like a very good profile. Yeah, that's really fascinating to me that you could get like really high quality protein from,

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       yeah, we're, we're prejudice against bugs I guess. I mean, I'm trying not to be anymore. Do you eat your bars? Oh yeah. Get all the time. All the time. All the time. Just because I don't, I don't use those kinds of snacks. I make my own bar, but because they, the guys who started expo are really onto something and they're trying to, they're trying to change the way the world thinks about sourcing protein. So the first hurdle you have to overcome is making a bar tastes great and not turn people off because it's cricket because it's crickets and you know, there's not like heads and antenna sticking out of these bars. It's a powder. It's been ground down to a fine powder and it basically looks and probably taste the same as whey protein isolate does. Once it's ground down, down, down. Um, do you lose any of it when you're dehydrating in or grinding it down or turn away?

Speaker 1:          01:50:36       It's, it's, it retains its properties pretty nicely. So there's no benefit whatsoever to eating it fresh. Um, not necessarily. No. I mean, if you can compact more into, uh, I mean that's the beauty of, of I think insect protein powder is to be able to fortify foods, uh, that, that otherwise, you know, rather than having 40 crickets on a stick, you know, to, to have the powder equivalent in a bar is kind of a neat way of doing it. I've eaten crickets like that too. Like roasted crickets. You don't taste bad at all. Not Bad. It's all in the head. Yeah, it really is. It's all in your mind. Like you, you, you chew them, they're crunchy and they're broasted over a fire. They're actually not bad at all. I mean, they're sold as delicacy in the streets of sure. You know, in Bangkok and most of Asia.

Speaker 1:          01:51:19       Yeah. Especially if you put some spices on them or some point that they can actually be quite tasting like maybe some butter or some oil and some spices on them. Yeah. We have these ideas about different things that are good to eat and not good to eat. And since more based on custom than anything and a lot of ways, yeah. I wonder how many people that are vegan would be willing to eat bugs, you know, Vegan as far as I know it goes against their religion, which I don't even want to use honey. No, I it's, it's crazy. That's funny you say that because we've got a bar that we just introduced with grass fed whey protein isolate and, and uh, um, it's got collagen in it. It's a great bar. Um, and we tried to bake one for the Vegan community and because it has honey in it is as a suite near the Vegan said, well we can't, we can't eat cause it has honey, it's bs, you know, that's there's are slaves, man. Yeah. Whatever. Okay. Whatever they want. You know, you want to go that way. Yeah. Honeys. Awesome. It fucks.

Speaker 1:          01:52:21       Is there any like nutritional benefit to being a Vegan or is it an deficits, you know, it's involved in it. Um, I think that's probably some foods that you're not getting that would provide a micro nutrients, the micro nutrition that would be beneficial to you in the long run. And, and yet the human body is so frigging, uh, adaptable to, to any sort of dietary strategy. I mean, you know, you see, uh, eight foot tall, uh, Africans, you know, the go play in the NBA that grew up on a, you know, 500 calories a day and cow patties. Um, you know, during the Irish potato famine, people live for six weeks on shoe leather and seaweed. I mean, the human body is pretty adaptable. So you on that one hand, um, you can't describe the perfect diet. So if you're choosing to be Vegan and that's what you want to do and, and you're mindful about it, um, and you're not militant about it and not trying to convince everybody else that that's what they ought to do, then then go for it.

Speaker 1:          01:53:21       Well, that doesn't exist yet. So few. That's, that was a requirement. That's the Unicorn Fart. A requirement of membership. Yeah. Um hmm. What, like what, what are the, there's a few plants that do have a full, complete amino acid profile, right? Like keen Wa is one of them. Yeah. I mean there's great plants. I don't know, I wouldn't say they have a full amino acid profile. It's what's lacking. Well, there's probably, if there's nothing lacking, it's the, it's the relative amounts that make the difference. So it's a protein efficiency ratio, right? Uh, the, the, the, um, the protein amino acid score that, that, uh, really determines whether a protein is, is exceptional and that's where the, you know, meat and eggs and, and, uh, you know, that dairy and things that someone was trying to describe that to me, the amount of Broccoli you would need to get the same amount of protein and amino acids as an eight ounce steak, something insane.

Speaker 1:          01:54:14       It's like two pounds of Broccoli. Yeah. I still, I don't think it's insane. I just think it's a cause. Ll those same people will argue that there's, um, there's, you know that it's a on a, on a, I think it's on a per pound basis. It's almost like it has the same amount of amino acids. I forget where I, where I heard that some, some Vegan side of that to me and I, I know that broccoli does have some amino acids in it. You just have to eat a big bowl of it and if you're a Vegan, that's what you do anyway. So, uh, I'm not going to criticize that choice. I just think that um, if you're missing certain amino acids, you better balance it with something coming from lagoons or some other source. You have to figure out what amino acids are lacking based on what plant protein in the human diet was always based on a wide variety of things that you were taking it and just, you know, not, not just one kind of thing, but something off of this Shrub, off of this Bush, out of this ground and the tuber here and some quail eggs here.

Speaker 1:          01:55:05       And, you know, it was always a 200 different choices, uh, within a five mile radius or whatever. You can just get whatever you get your hands on it. And that's where the insects came in. That's where the, you know, we don't talk about, you know, amphibians, but imagine living on frogs and snakes and, and eggs and, uh, uh, you know, in wheat grass and just, it's, uh, it's pretty amazing the variety of foods that we can eat. So typically you start your morning off with butter, coffee with mct oils, which I don't just eat a regular coffee and it's regular. That's just, I don't, I don't, I'll have a buttered coffee every once in a while, but I don't, I don't feel like I need the calories to get my day going. I just want the cup of coffee. You just want the caffeine, just want the caffeine.

Speaker 1:          01:55:46       And I actually don't want to, um, I don't want to interfere with burning off my own body fat. So, uh, not that it interferes with it, but that's 500 calories that, that or 250 calories coming out of the coffee that otherwise just coming off my, you know, my gut. Interesting. So when you wake up in the morning, it's all dependent upon how hungry you are. Yeah. So if you're hungry, maybe then you'll have some butter coffee. And if you're not hungry, it was her regular coffee, black, a nod, a little bit of cream, but just enough to color it and like, uh, your first meal of the day, it's probably lunch. Yup. And what did, what does that, uh, usually a salad. I have a big ass salad, I call it. And uh, it's um, it's lots of Greens and some form of protein might be salmon, might be chicken from last night's dinner, might be a tuna.

Speaker 1:          01:56:37       Um, well what size? Like an eight ounce portion. Now it's a bitch. No, I mean, no, not much protein. I, that's the other thing that I've realized over the years is that we don't need that much protein. And even if you're doing work in the gym, you know, you don't need 200 grams of protein a day. That's bullshit. You just can't process that. What is that from? That's from a bodybuilding power lifting my town that's from the muscle and fitness days. And that's from Dave draper and his fricking, you know, blender full of stuff was dave draper. Oh my God, you don't. So Dave draper's before your time, man. So he was on the original, uh, southern California blond bodybuilders. He was in every ad for, for shakes and, and mass gainers and things like that. Mass gain. Yeah. It's all sugar, right? Yeah. Oh that does it. That's nasty stuff. That's just like cheap cheap ass protein and high fructose corn. Yeah. They're, yeah. Stayed there. Yeah. On the beach. Hello ladies.

Speaker 1:          01:57:35       So that guy, uh, would advocate massive amounts, but I mean that guy, you know, when you, when you can process, when you take it in, uh, you know, super human levels of steroids, you can process all kinds of protein. Look at them today. So today, Jamie, yeah, still looking pretty good. He's probably about 70 their yolk. 60 what? 63 63 right there. He's your age. Yoked is fuck. Look at them. Maybe does a little steroids too when we think, do you think could be huh? But a, so people using needing protein, it's, you know, maybe women probably need 50 to 75, maybe 80 grams a day. Um, even guys, you know, training fairly hard, don't no more than 113 hundred 40 grams a day. Now what is, what's the muscle and fitness mentality or the powerlifting mentality? It's like there's a certain amount of grams per pound of body weight. Describe. Well, you know, that's all over the place. So it might've been one gram per pound of body weight at 1.5 grams per pound of body weight. Well, it's like 200 grams a day for me or, yeah. Yeah. Graham, I'm 200 pounds.

Speaker 3:          01:58:42       200 grams of protein. That's a shitload of broke. How much is a steak? Like a 12 ounce steak? 50 60. But Jesus Christ. Yeah. So I'd have to four fucking stakes in a day. Yeah. I mean by the time you cook that down, yeah. It might be less. Right. What about eggs? How much is it an egg? Seven or eight per ticket. Yeah. That's why these guys would do a whole dozen eggs in there, shake. Um, you know, that'd be 70 or 80, or 80 or 90 or whatever grams of protein plus some powder in there. And, but you know, the, what we learned a long time ago was a body really can't handle more than 30, 35 grams of protein at a sitting. So the rest of it turns into, um, you know, the farts. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:59:23       So if you're, if you're eating, that's one thing. If you've ever been around people who drink a lot of protein shakes and eat protein bars, they're farts are brutal like bodybuilder type dudes. And that's just, they just, there's too much protein, right? Yeah. Among other things. Yeah. Yeah. A lot of that is, you know, they haven't, um, who knows what's going on with their, with their gut bacteria too. That's a lot of protein to put in there. They're probably, if they're eating that much protein, they're not eating much of the way of vegetables and those muscle milk type supplements, although there are delicious, there's a lot of sugar in those damn thing. Absolutely. Yeah. All those bars, a lot of bars have a lot of sugar in them. This is a giant issue. Yup. Yeah. Hmm. So, um, you think that these guys, these bodybuilder guys are power powerlifter guys that are operating on that inefficient method of one gram per pound.

Speaker 3:          02:00:13       If they had reduced it, they would still have the same amount of gains and maybe their body would operate more efficiently. Are we talking on juice or off the juice? Oh, okay. That's a good point. You know. Yeah. So back to your on steroids. Back to your point about, um, you know, I'm a hard gainer and you know, putting on muscle is, is, is difficult. Um, most people are overweight, don't want to hear this, but putting on muscle is much more difficult than losing body fat. You know, you take a 165 pound guy and you say, oh, he says, I want to put on 20 pounds of muscle. Ain't going to happen. You know, might put on 10 pounds of muscle, might put on seven over a very focused period of time. It might have to work hard to keep it on because that's the body also going.

Speaker 3:          02:00:55       If you don't create on a daily basis, my requirement to continue to maintain this muscle mass, I'm going back down to where it was right there. It seems to me that there's a number of days or years or whatever it is that you maintain that body mass where it starts to become normal. Then your body says, well this is what we way now. Yeah, and then you, you maintain it, but there's this touch and go period. Say if you weigh one 65 and you put on that 10 pounds like, well you got to keep pushing for a long time for your body to say, listen, this is what we way we need all this power. We needed all this horsepower and we were going to be able to carry a lot of heavy shit all the time. Yup, exactly. Yeah. Bring your own honey. Is that what's going on with no, no, no. Jamie, what is that? Oh that's you are honey. I'm having some which just like to here.

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       This guy's serious. This brings his own hunting. No, no, no, but honey is good for you, isn't it now? Raw honey. No. How dare you. I know. Who are you? It's not. It's not good for you. It's not going to kill you. You know any that's one of those moderation foods. If you want to use it to like in this case I put a couple of drops in the, in the tea, but I always hear it's really good. Like raw honey. Did you hear? Who Do you hear it from? Not The vegans money that people make, honey. Yeah. I don't know. It's just a, it's something that I've always heard is it's not bad. It's just all sugar. It's a form of sugar. And if you overdo it then it's probably not as wise a decision as to cut it back. So we got to your launch your launch, which a big ass out with a small amount of protein.

Speaker 1:          02:02:21       So maybe like four ounces of protein or something along those lines. Yeah. Okay. What piece of chicken or a piece of fish or something like that. And then, um, what about dinner? Um, dinner. I like to have a stake. I got this Wagyu short rib that I get you. Like that stuff is so good, but it's all fatty. Yeah. That's the point. We like that. That's the point, ma'am. Yeah. And uh, cause you liked fat. Yeah, no, I, my diet is probably 55% of my calories come from fat, but Wagyu is a lot of corn fed animal. All right. So I'm, so I make a little bit of an exception there. Um, I could get a grass fed when I, you know, when I, when I look forward at a Pc Greens where I shop in Malibu, but um, or at whole foods or whatever.

Speaker 1:          02:03:03       But this, this Wagyu, uh, it's just such a delicious, you like a nice tender juicy steak. Yup. Is there any benefit like what are the health benefits of eating grass fed meat and using grass fed cows? Butter? Yeah, it's really interesting because, um, one of the things I, I just kind of have to raise my eyebrows add is I hear about grass fed whey protein isolate, right? So you have grass fed whey protein. It's whatever they put in the drink. Well, the reason you eat grass fed cows is because the fatty acid profile is more, um, uh, it's, it's a more desirable fatty acid profile. The protein compliment is the exact same in a corn fed steak or a grass fed steak. You just can't tell the difference in the protein. It's the fatty acid profile that's different. The other difference might be the residual hormones and antibiotics.

Speaker 1:          02:03:53       So when they raise corn fed beef and they start from an early age, that's not the, the cows native diet. So they, the cow tends to get sick, get infected and so these antibiotics and they have to use a in, sometimes he use growth hormone just to get them off the lot quicker. So, but, but the, the, the reason to have grass fed beef is the fatty acid profile is much more desirable. Uh, and yet it's still, it's still fat. So it's just a couple of different versions of stearic acid and, and different versions of the saturated fat that you're talking about. So it's not even like this life or death decision that you make. Like if I have a wonderful cut of corn fed steak, I'm going to die. If I have grass fed a live forever. These are just choices. And if, if you, if you can find a great tasting grass fed steak, by all means habit.

Speaker 1:          02:04:45       If you can have a great find a relatively inexpensive, you know, lined line caught wild salmon, that's a probably a better choice for your stated goals. Then some farm raised salmon. So yeah, the farm raised salmon is a, it's problematic because of their diet, right? Yep. But so back, but just back to the, the grasp of things. So when you get to grass fed whey protein isolate, whey protein isolate is 90 to 95% protein. There's, they took all the fat out of it so it doesn't matter. They all the good fatty acid profile that was in it because it was grass fed is now gone. So it's like a marketing strategy to call it grass fed whey protein isolate. So it's not bad, but it's not any better. No, it's, it's definitely not bad. It's, it's not demonstrably better to have grass fed whey protein isolate versus just regular.

Speaker 1:          02:05:34       What about grass fed butter? Grass fed butter? Yeah, yeah, absolutely. That's all fat. So that there's, and there's an example of, that's the exact opposite. Now they took all the protein out of it and now just giving you fat. So grass fed butter is a great choice. And what is the difference in the profile? The, the fatty profile of a grass fed butter versus same as it is with the meat. So it w when is that difference? Um, I can't, I can't cite the research and I can't cite to break down to the of the fatty acids. It's just that they're more appropriate for a, a cow that was raised on its native diet. Pop was the difference between the fact, cause I've heard it but I can't cite it when somebody wants to bring it up. But I prefer the taste of a grass fed meat.

Speaker 1:          02:06:17       Yeah. Cause it's a leaner, like more dense meat. It's more like wild game. Right. Then um, like uh, a ribeye from a cow that's fed corn. Right. But you're saying that like health wise had rib eyes pretty good. Pretty good. Yeah. It's more of a fatty cut. Yeah. Um, so, but you're saying there's not that much of a difference in terms of like the health benefits. If you can get a, again, a humanely raised a cow that was not given antibiotics or hormones, um, you're pretty close to where you want to be. And so I'm suggesting that the fatty acid profile isn't going to be hugely different, isn't the issue with cows that when you give a cow grains, their body isn't designed to process it. So they develop a lot of infections and, and that's, that's why they use the antibiotics. So isn't that, I mean, just automatically problematic if you have a grain fed cow?

Speaker 1:          02:07:10       Not necessarily. So a lot of times you'll have a cow that was raised on grass and then finished with grain. Um, and there's different types of grains. So some it's not automatically problematic. Um, it, it could be, but if you look for the cows that were, uh, pastured up until a certain point and you know, again, they might've been grass finished, sometimes they'll, they'll say grass fed and they won't, they won't tell you it was grain. And when they say green finished, how much time do they spend feeding them grain? It's a couple of weeks. That's it. Yep. Okay. So they just fatten up for the last couple of weeks before the end. Yup. And so they don't have enough time to develop a lot of the massive issues of they might have if they were, uh, in Corinth the whole life in theory. So, um, you'll, you'll lead a little bit of steak and a steam vegetables.

Speaker 1:          02:07:56       That's what I have my big plate of Broccoli or Broccolini or partial spouts or, you know, whatever. And what about like drinks? What do you drink mostly? So I used to drink wine at meals. I don't drink a lot of water. I'm a soothing a throat today, but um, with this, but normally I wouldn't drink much, uh, much water during the course of the day. I let my thirst mechanism, you know, just sort of tell me what to do. And I don't get thirsty that often. I mean, I used to go on 50 mile bike rides and not get thirsty, so I've got a real, yeah. Yeah. Is that just weird? Just you missed, I know other people like that. A lot of people are of the belief that you should drink water all day, so you have to pee all the time cause you're flushing your body.

Speaker 1:          02:08:37       I don't, I don't buy that at all. No, I think it's unnecessary. It's probably, yeah, it's, uh, I definitely don't agree with that concept. Um, but you might want to do it once in a while just to, you know, do your own little cleanse or whatever. But I don't think as a rule of thumb that, that there's any particular health benefit to that put about the toxins, the toxins out. Man, I didn't pay clear. I need to drink more. Yeah, that's, that's bullshit. Um, I think so. Yeah. Um, I know a lot of people who still do it. I know a lot of, you know, people at the gym bring their gallon jug of distilled water in or whatever the hell it is really bad. Right. Ros, Ros water yet. Yeah. Because when you drink distilled water, there's no minerals in it. It actually robs your body of minerals because they're like, takes the minerals out.

Speaker 1:          02:09:20       Right? Yeah. Um, so don't drink unless your Thursday. I mean, that's my rule of thumb and I, and I don't, so what do I drink with meals? Um, until recently I was drinking wine with meals. How come he stopped? So, uh, I'd written a lot about wines over the years and, and how, uh, you know, the research shows that wine drinkers live longer than teetotallers, resveratrol, all that stuff. And, uh, there's a lot of good, compelling evidence to drink wine. And yet at the root of the matter, wine is still a source of ethanol. Ethanol is toxic to the body. So you're putting a toxin in your body every time you drink wine. I'm starting to look at that in my own case and realized that I wasn't sleeping as well as I want it to. And sleep's a big thing for me. So, um, but I was a two glass a night wine drinker for 30 years.

Speaker 1:          02:10:08       I'm just, it wasn't dinner if I didn't have wine. And, um, so I went on a 30 day, which I do often when a 30 day experiment of one, see what happened, it cut out the wine, um, felt great, uh, slept better, and that I was never really, it never woke up hungover. I mean, I've never, my kids have never seen me. My kids are 22 and 25 they'd never seen me drunk. My wife has never seen me drunk. It's not like I was abusing anything, but I had this regular pattern of drinking wine. So I went off it and I realized that I was benefiting from it. Uh, so for last year and a half, I really cut back on the one I still have a glass or two. What was the benefit of that? You watched? I didn't wake up at three o'clock in the morning and then not be able to get back to sleep for an hour.

Speaker 1:          02:10:48       That was the big thing that I noticed for myself was I would fall asleep really easily and then I would wake up two or three in the morning and have a tough time getting back to sleep. And that sort of subsided when I went off the wine. So the, that's that's the result of the effect of alcohol. Your body processed to the alcohol. The alcohol is a depressant and knocks you out, your body processes it, and then once it's done processing it, then your sleep cycles disturbed. So you wake up, is that what happened in Chinese medicine says that that's when your liver is working at at three, three o'clock in the morning. So maybe that's when the real processing was starting to take take place or I don't know. You know what item, not huge adherent of Chinese medicine. I'm not suggesting that it's not an important thing to look at, but in my case the sleep benefited tremendously.

Speaker 1:          02:11:31       So feel any better other than the sleep? Yeah, I mean I think so. I mean, I didn't really notice. Like I say, I never woke up hung over and I've always felt refreshed waking up, but I didn't like not getting that sleep and, and having to, and then in my case, because I'm a, I'm not good at managing stress and I have a fair amount of stress, just business stuff in my life. So that's, you know, when you can't sleep at three o'clock in the morning and that's when all the business shit kind of starts to circulate in the brain, you know, and how's this going to happen and how are we going to do that? So, so I didn't like that part of it. Um, so year and a half went without drinking wine and I replaced it with, I used to be a prodigious beer drinker before I gave up the grains.

Speaker 1:          02:12:11       Um, and uh, and I started, I found a couple of, um, nonalcoholic beers that I like. And, uh, so again, it was for me it was about the habit that the ritual of dinner. So I needed, I couldn't just drink water. I hate, I hate drinking water with dinner. So I wanted to find something to replace the ritual part of the wine. And I found these nonalcoholic beers drink. So I had one with dinner at night, maybe one and a half. These non grained made, no, they're, they're made with grains, but it's not, they don't affect me, uh, to an extent. And uh, and so that's, that's what I've been doing for the last year and a half. And then recently, um, I came across a guy who is looking at Paleo wines and, and I, I'm going to do it if you coined a new phrase, this as a marketing ploy.

Speaker 1:          02:13:00       Now there's these wines are 300 wineries in the world among the tens of thousands, uh, that don't use additives or sulfites or colorants or formaldehyde or any of the shit that we put in wine in this country. So if you look at what, how wines are made in the u s some of the more, um, desirable wines from a nose perspective have all kinds of crap in them. And there's like 87 approved additives that the government allows us wine makers to put in their wines. And that's the shit that causes you to get the hangover and feel bad from drinking the wine, particularly red wines, uh, and wake up in the middle of the night and not be able to sleep. So, um, this guy approaches me one day actually I met him at, um, at a conference and uh, he started telling me a story and last I'm not, I'm not buying it.

Speaker 1:          02:13:55       You know, you've got these wines that don't have, that won't cause you to fall asleep or don't, won't cause you to wake up in the middle of the night. He goes, I was like, you mark. I gave up drinking wine and I'm a, I love wines, but it gave him up because I didn't like what it was doing to me. And I found this new, these new wines. So he sources wines from around the world that are made in wineries that don't use any of these additives. And I, and I, he gave me a case of them to try different brands and different things and none of them from the u s they're all from Europe or South America or whatever. Um, and these are wineries had been around for 300 years. They just never bought into the concept of adding shit to wines. Right. And, you know, I realized I, some of these wines I can drink and enjoy and feel a little bit of, uh, taking the edge off and then go to bed and have no ill effects at all. So I'm sort of opening my mind to the fact that there's some, some Paleo type wines out there that don't have the additives in them, in them that, um, that consumed in moderation or probably enjoyable and potentially helpful.

Speaker 3:          02:14:58       The term Paleo seems to be a loaded term because people connect it with the idea of the Paleolithic era and what people ate at that time. But it's not, we're not talking about that when you're talking about Paleo wine. You know what I mean? Like it seems a weird, it's a weird term. Yeah. And he doesn't, he doesn't really use the term he uses natural. Yeah. Um, but, but it, the market to which he was catering at the time itself to Paleo communicates the Paleo community. Yeah. Yeah. It's almost like they need a better word than Paleo because it's not necessarily even what people ate during the Paleolithic era. You just reducing grains or eliminating them and, and concentrating on fats. That's not necessarily what people ate during the period.

Speaker 1:          02:15:42       I mean, that's one of the great misnomers that general public has about the Paleo Diet. Is it, if a caveman didn't need it, then we should need it. We'll, none of this stuff existed in caveman. It's time. Nothing that we'd even, even the stuff we get out of the ground or off the trees didn't exist then. It's all been manipulated by farming and, and, and, uh, you know, whether it was inserting gene, it wasn't inserting genes, but we still did genetic manipulation of, of foods to get them

Speaker 3:          02:16:06       sweeter and more protein or whatever. Maybe it's a loaded term and we need a new term, something like primal maybe or, right. Well, the primal blueprint. Oh, hey, that's a good one. Maybe you should run with that. I thought I'll try. It honestly is probably better than Paleo, right?

Speaker 1:          02:16:21       I thought from the beginning, I s I started, uh, my project, uh, writing the blog in 2006 and I knew early on wanted a brand that was sort of unique and separate from Paleo. I thought Paleo had too much baggage from caveman on it. And primal sort of has a primary, you know, first importance kind of thing as well as, um, as well as going back to primal times and primal urge or whatever. So, um, hence the term primal blueprint and my primal fuel and my food products, primal kitchen, they're all kind of based around that. So these additives that they're putting in wine, it's just from an economic standpoint, it allows the process to want to know. It's from a consumer demand point of view. So you know when you get some of these, um, I don't want to name names, but some of my favorite really expensive California wines that I used to love because of the way they taste them, a thick and rich looking and you know, Okie and all this just additives all crap they're putting in there because that's what the consumer thinks is going to make for a sophisticated wine.

Speaker 1:          02:17:26       Wow. And all that is chemical additives that fuck with your body. Yeah. Not all. I mean it enough that they all do. Wow. That's bizarre. I never would have thought that. And when I think of wine, I thought wines, just fermented grapes and they go through a process and they store it and yeah, my friend Maynard makes one, I need to contact him. You know, you know the band tool? Yeah. Maynard, the lead singer tool. He has a, an awesome wine company. Could do ceus. Why did they make their own wine? Or they somebody else's, somebody won. He grows his own grease. Fucking crazy though. He's, yeah. I mean, I don't want people to grow grapes in Malibu, but none of them make their own wine. They stayed, they truck it out to some distillery demand. When they truck it out, this guy takes it and throws a bunch of shit.

Speaker 1:          02:18:10       Well, whatever that the grower, the grapes who's got his own label will say, I want it to have this, these properties. It's got to be, you know, this, this color and this thick. And sometimes if the grapes don't, you know, can't pr in and of themselves provide that. I mean, a lot of the stuff comes from the, a lot of the tannins in wine come from the grape skin. And uh, to get the deep, deep, deep, deep rich color, you have to, you have to mash the grapes up in the skin up even more and more and more. So more that Tannin to get the red, the deep red colors in the wine date, they have to provide more of the skin. And that's what's causing a lot of the tannins. So for some people have issues with the, that you hear about the histamines and wine.

Speaker 1:          02:18:50       Again, that's the, that's the marketplace demanding a deep red wine. And so it's a color issue, part of a color. It could be color, it could be, again, some of the, you know, adding sugar to the wines. A lot of the u s wines have a lot of sugar in them, like a, like a fairly high sugar content. The Guy I'm talking about here who, who led me down this this road and sort of opened my eyes to this, he's been in Ketosis for two years and he couldn't drink wine because the sugar would take him out of Ketosis, the sugar and why. So that's sort of one of the reasons he got started on that. He was a lifetime wine drinker, grew up in wine country up in Sonoma, and I'm an adult Delton the business and sort of left it because he got disenchanted and then came back when he discovered that there were these wines that have no sugar, that have no self or, you know, minimal sulfite to me. And I'll, I'll, uh, natural, uh, fruits and vegetables have some amount of sulfites but not added, no added Sulfites, um, uh, and, and none of these 80 or so approved, uh, added ingredients that can affect the color and the smell and the, and the, and the thickness.

Speaker 2:          02:19:54       That is really interesting. That's something I never even consider. I never even thought there was additives and won. I just thought it was just grapes. I thought it was pretty simple.

Speaker 1:          02:20:03       Well, these are American companies that do this. Is there anything local? I don't know. I mean he's, the, the, the things that he's given me are, um, uh, all from, from other countries.

Speaker 2:          02:20:14       That sounds so counter intelligent, intuitive that we grow so much wine in California. But to get wine without any shit in it, you'd have to get it from Europe because we're so concentrated right now, at least this part of the country is, uh, on, you know, natural foods and you know, grass fed beef and organic vegetables. The fact that we would have wines that almost all primarily.

Speaker 1:          02:20:37       Yeah, that's nuts. Oh, it is. Um, and it may be that I'm, you know, that he hasn't sent me any that are from the u s but most of these are from, from other, uh,

Speaker 2:          02:20:46       and where would you order something like that? I want to try that now because I like wine. I love red wine. A dry wine farms is the guys, is the name of the company. Dry wine farms dry.

Speaker 1:          02:20:58       Yup. I always think of dry. It's like a, that's like the way that

Speaker 2:          02:21:03       kind of white wine that people like a dry white wine. Right?

Speaker 1:          02:21:07       Yup. Hmm.

Speaker 2:          02:21:09       I just never would have believed that it was the additives that are causing all that.

Speaker 1:          02:21:13       Well, so now we're back to that, that initial discussion we had about let's, what you don't eat right. That really affects you more than what you do eat. And, and so if you're getting, um, you know, uh, you're eating appropriately grown cuts of meat and organic vegetables and you're cutting out the, the organic, I've, excuse me, cutting out the industrial seed oils, cutting out the sugar, cutting out the processed grains and some of the other grains. And in their place, you're, and you're cutting out, in this case, crappy wine and, and, and substituting fruits, vegetables, meat, fish, fowl, eggs, nuts, seeds, and hit. Now we have, you know, again, if we want to enjoy life, and that's one of the things that we might consider an enjoyable part of life is, is partaking of a glass of red or white wine with dinner. Now it's kind of back on the menu for some people.

Speaker 1:          02:22:02       That's interesting. That's really interesting. So, but it's not necessarily on the menu for, you know, so, uh, and having said that, um, I'm not finding myself back in that situation where I'm drinking wine with dinner again because I've, I've, I still recognize for myself that it's the ethanol that I'm not, I just intuitively, I don't like putting that amount of ethanol in my body on a regular basis. So once in a while as a hormetic, you know, uh, uh, insult, if you will, that's fine. The body will adapt to it and use it as to its benefit. But on a regular basis, probably. So just the sheer alcohol content of wine was causing an issue. It wasn't just the additives. No. So, so the, the additives were probably causing the issue because with, with these wines, I wasn't waking up in the middle of the night and it was, so I felt as if I hadn't had the wine.

Speaker 1:          02:22:57       So what's the ethanol ethanol is, is that's the alcohol, that's the form of alcohol in the wines. Right. But it's not the additives. No, no, no that, no, that's what you're trying to get at is, is ethanol is the, is the alcohol and the wine. That's what gives you, right. That's not what's being added. Right. So, but you had decided that it wasn't the ethanol, but I still didn't like the idea. It's not about the issues as much as it's just, um, it's like I can, I can consume a fair amount of sugar over the course of a day and not have not gained weight and not have it affect my blood sugar. I just choose not to because I know it's bad for me. Right. So you don't even like a glass of wine once it happens, fine. Yeah. Once in a while it's fine.

Speaker 1:          02:23:38       But it hasn't ever been, has it been shown that there's some longevity? Right. That's, yeah. So do you think that's the Rivera trial, which is an antioxidant? I don't, I think, I think I could be wrong, but my interpretation of some of these studies is that you take two cohorts of people who have each of whom have a shitty diet and are going to die of heart disease in large numbers. And you give one with the cohorts, two glasses of wine a night and you give the other glass or the other cohort none. And over time you look at the two groups and you realize that the group that had two glasses of wine tonight didn't have as many cardiac events as probably cause their blood was thin from it, from the wine or something. You know, it's like, it's not that it's bestowing longevity on these people, it's that they're not dying at the same rate from their shitty diet.

Speaker 1:          02:24:28       Because some, my guess is it's probably some artificial blood thinning that's happening or something like that. Huh. But why is it a, it's sort of conventional wisdom that it's resveratrol. Well, fair one of the components of why, but, but you, you would have to drink, you know, 750 glasses of wine to get the amount of resveratrol that you can get in a resveratrol capsule. There's not a lot of resveratrol in wine. There is some, and it's, it's a, it's a well studied, um, you know, component of, of wine. Uh, in fact, there've been companies founded on just providing resveratrol as an anti aging, uh, nutrient, but it's not, there's not a lot of risk virtual and wine. And I'm not, and I don't think any of these studies have ever pointed to the fact that it's the resveratrol in the wine that you're drinking, that's conferring longevity on this group versus that group. Do you think there's any benefit and consuming exogenous ketones? Okay. Uh, no, not on balance. I think if you're an athlete and you're looking to, um, to maximize performance, there might be places in which you could consume exogenous ketones. First of all, if you haven't, if you're not keto adapted, it's, it's a joke. There's no reason to take exogenous ketones if, if you're fat adapted in Quito adapted, um, there may be a reason to take exogenous ketones in, in an event, um, instead of sugar. But

Speaker 3:          02:25:53       like, say if you're going to run, do some

Speaker 1:          02:25:57       amen. And yet to my knowledge, there aren't many great tasting

Speaker 3:          02:26:02       tone salts. So now you've got a palatability issue as well with a lot of these things. Have you tried them? No, I haven't, but I've been fascinated by ketogenic diets over the last couple months. I've been really considering trying. Yeah. I mean there's, there's some potentially good science there, but I can't give you a practical application right now, uh, where it would, where it would work other than in some elite event where, where somebody was, uh, you know, racing all out for hours and was completely keto adapted prior to the event. And, you know, was, was so good at, um, at, uh, using ketones in the brain that they could, they could hold off bonking for another hour or two. So they would take a, some sort of a ketogenic supplement in their water or something along those lines. Yeah, yeah. Or not, not necessarily on water, but some, yes, some drink would probably be the easiest way to do it. So if you were going to recommend to someone to try to make your body more fat, adaptive, um, what would be the first step? Just just to radically cut back on sugar? Should you do it slowly? She to taper off. Oh, she just, just give him up.

Speaker 1:          02:27:08       Um, either way. I mean, it's easier. I think if you, if you just give it up, he just, you know, go all in. Um, if you're somebody who's been depending on sugar your whole life and you're, you know, you're doing four or 500, 600 grams a day of carbohydrate, uh, then, um, you know, going down to a hundred or 120 is going to be painful for the first couple of weeks. Now I say painful. We have this thing called the low carb flu. So you go from your body, your brain, expecting to have you refuel every meal for every couple of hours every day with carbohydrate to then, um, uh, reducing it down to 120, 150 grams a day. The brain starts to go, what? What's going on here? I mean, the muscles haven't yet built the metabolic machinery to burn fat. They're working on it and they're upregulating the, the genes are turning on to create the enzymes, but they're not there yet. It takes about 21 days to do this. So in the process, the body's expecting sugar, and if you're trying to work out at the same time, you're going to be screwed because now you have your sugar depleted and you haven't learned how to burn fat yet and the brain is depleted. And so the brain goes, fuck it. I'm foggy. I can't thank, I've got a headache. I'm dizzy. This sucks. I'm going to get a Bagel though.

Speaker 3:          02:28:18       It's a lot happened to me when I did the Atkins Diet for, yeah, many,

Speaker 1:          02:28:22       many years ago. A lot of people get derailed first or second week. Yeah. Yeah. So you have to not train during that time or at least cut it way back. Don't do any good look glycolytic training. So just ride the bike easy, go for a hike or do some stuff like that. But you can't really train, train hard when you're doing that because how long does it take to adapt? So f one or two weeks, um, people get through that fog and then they'll, they'll be good. Um, I have a book called the 21 day total body transformation. It's the 21 days is about how long it takes to get 80% of the benefits of becoming a fat burning beast is what we call it. A fat burning piece that, I like that. Yeah. So you got to commit to it and you've got to assume there's going to be an adjustment period.

Speaker 1:          02:29:06       Yeah. Yeah. And, and in that adjustment period, it's not going to be, I mean, for some people it's minimal, is that they just feel a little bit low energy or whatever. Other people get headaches and woozy because that's the brain, again, recognizing that there's no glucose and it hasn't yet built the metabolic machinery to burn ketones. Um, even though the body may be producing ketones and, and when the body produces ketones, um, you can either burn them as fuel or you can spill them out in the urine and the breath. And so a lot of people who have not yet become keto adapted like a sugar burner. Carbohydrate dependent person will still produce ketones. If you skip two meals, you know, you wake up in the morning, you're basically fast and if you're a sugar burner and you wake up and if you don't eat breakfast, you might smell ketones on that person's breath.

Speaker 1:          02:29:53       Or they might, you know, pee on a strip and it shows a certain amount of ketones in the blood, in the, in the, in the urine because, because the body's just getting rid of the ketones because you can't burn them. It doesn't have burn him yet. So to consuming exonerations ketones doesn't accentuate a ketogenic diet. So I don't accelerate it. I don't know. I don't know enough about the clinical trials are going on right now. But my assumption would be that if you take exogenous ketones and you're not fat adapted to Quito adapted it, it's not going to necessarily prompt you to, to become that unless you've done the dietary manipulation as well. Okay. So there's no shortcuts to that transitionary period between, uh, a glucose based diet and a of fat based Diet. There's just going to have to be a transitionary period? I think so.

Speaker 1:          02:30:38       Cause like I say, I think, I think if you skip a meal, you're producing ketones. So just, and you're pissing them out. So adding more ketones, it's just going to piss out more ketones. So you've got to show, by the way, going to be a superstar when you piss on the Strip because you got your ketones plus the exogenous ketones. But this all starts in great. But this also, but I feel like shit I'm doing, but the Strip says I'm doing great. Right? Yeah. Okay. So this trip's not nearly as important as the actual physical performance and where you feel. So no matter what, you're going to have to go through a tree. So if you like they say it looks just me, Gal like me. If you, if I had a shitty diet, I mean spaghetti all day, um, you would recommend that for a couple of weeks.

Speaker 1:          02:31:16       I just take it real light and make this, make a commitment to making the adjustment and the Diet, doing a fat based diet with very low sugar, very low carbohydrates, cut out the grains entirely. You get all your carbohydrates from celery and lettuce and vegetables and some fruits and just make a commitment to it. Yeah. And part of that commitment is, I'm not going to train like a banshee for the first two weeks. I'm just gonna I'll train, but I'll do easy stuff. And that's why the first chapter in our book, which should be about diet, is about training and about low level training. And which book, which the primal endurance book that just came out a few weeks ago. Um, the first chapter should be about die because that's clearly one of the most important parts. But we talk about training first because we figured enough endurance athletes would read the book that if they read the diet part first, they would continue training at the high level and, and, and embrace the Diet and then fall apart.

Speaker 1:          02:32:11       So we got to get the training dialed in first for those people and say, you've got to, here's why you have to cut back. Um, here's why you can't exceed a heart rate of one 80 minus your age for the first couple of weeks, uh, training. Uh, when you're doing long distance stuff and at that rate you'll be burning mostly fat. So you'll be accentuating what's going on on the dietary side, which is restricting carbohydrates and providing more fat and more healthy fats for your body and creating more mitochondrial biogenesis upregulating those mitochondria to become efficient at burning fat. How long does it take before your body reaches the optimum level of Mitochondria? I mean, um, we, we see, um, athletes who are still, uh, who get 80% of their benefit the first three weeks and then s and then another 10% over the next six months.

Speaker 1:          02:32:59       And then the final, the final benefits kick in the last six months because it sometimes you lose your, your, your top end power diminishes as you become fat adapted, you got to get that top end power back. But that's what we build in the gym. Um, so it's a, it's a longer process, but once it happens, so it's like 80% and then six weeks later, another 10% and then six weeks later, six could be six months later, another, another 10%. So in the course of a full year, you're still slowly adapting I think. I think within a year, maybe a little bit more than a year, you can, if you do everything right, you can be this completely rebuilt engine. That's amazing. So, and then there's gotta be some benefits in terms of longevity, in terms of your ability to do work over long periods of time, like, well, one of the things that that's most compelling is a, again, coming from an endurance community where marriages fall apart because the guy would rather go for a 100 mile ride on Sunday morning and then stay in bed and cuddle with a wife, you know, or would would rather Ameritas fall class?

Speaker 1:          02:34:01       One of the reasons, but I thought it was money. Yeah. Well it is money, the $8,000 bike, uh, to go on the, on the ride. Um, so, um, where are we going with that? Uh, longevity. Yeah. Marriages fall apart. Yeah. So, so the longevity part, um, one of the things that happens is you, you train less, there's less total training time to get the results that you wanted because you're doing it methodically and you're not just putting it all out there every day and crossing your fingers and saying, well, I'm training as much as this guy, so I must, I better be as fast or faster than he is. Right. You're doing a, an approach that's very scripted, a detailed and methodical at one on one end of the spectrum on the other end. It's also sporadic and fractal. It's like a wake up today and I don't feel like doing what I had in my plan.

Speaker 1:          02:34:51       Take the day off. Because if you've got, if today's the day you're going to go hard and you feel like shit, do not go hard, there's no magic, there's no benefit. There's no, there's no points that you gain from doing it. In fact, it'll, it'll take you down the toilet. So you, you learn to become intuitive about your training and period. This city is one of the words we talk about where you paradise, you, there's, there's moments where you're, there's times when you're going very make your longer workouts longer and slower and you're a hard workouts shorter and harder. Um, and, and, and in the B in the middle of these, um, you know, be intuitive about, about how you feel, how much sleep did you get? Are you fueled appropriately for today's event? Are you, do you have, uh, uh, is there a purpose to today's workout other than just go accumulate miles?

Speaker 1:          02:35:37       Because I'll feel like shit, I'll feel like a slob if I don't. Uh, and, and if you could get around all that, you can, you can start to see some amazing benefits with less pain and suffering and sacrifice less being beat up, less burnout, less time. And presumably if you do it right, better results anyway than the old, than the old paradigm. So that's going to cause a real dilemma with people that are obsessed with the work rate. Uh, obsessed with just doing more than anybody else, obsessed with proving to themselves. They push themselves, they put in all those hours and accumulate and looking at it. They look at their, you know, a lot of people have apps on their phone. Yeah. Measure how many I know. Oh Shit, it's nine o'clock at night. We just finished dinner. Honey, I only have 16,000 steps. I got to, I'm going to walk back to the hotel or the house cause I gotta get to 20.

Speaker 1:          02:36:27       It's bullshit. That stuff is so ridiculous. And yet, you know, I was there, I was one of those people who, um, you know, I lived my life based on the amount of miles I accumulated and measured myself worth a on whether or not it could hang with everybody I ever raced or race with in a workout, you know, and never let anybody half wheel me on a bike ride, uh, in, in any workout. And it was, it was fun I guess, and it was part of my lifestyle, but it's not, you got to go back to the, to the essence of why are you doing this? If you're doing it just to hang out. People used to say, hey mark, you so disciplined, man, you're, you're out there and you're riding 60 miles a hundred miles. Some days you're running 10, you are so disciplined and might, the joke is, I'm thinking to myself, are you fucking kidding me?

Speaker 1:          02:37:12       I'm not disciplined. Discipline is going to work and, and you know, putting in a full, productive eight hours and then finding a little bit of time to work out or maybe hang out with a family. It is, it was so easy for me to get on a bike and go put some miles in or go for a run and shrug every other duty off. Mm. You know? And that's the one of the dangers of being an endurance athlete. It's addictive. It's a, it's a, it's a very addictive pursuit you are creating, especially if you're beating yourself up every day. You're creating endorphins, endogenous morphine, like substances that sit on those same receptor sites, the painkilling site and the pleasure giving sites that you would inject heroin to achieve. Now you just doing it naturally and you're doing it every single day and you crave it every day. And if you take five days off, you feel like shit you go with through withdrawal. So there's that part of it as well that we have to look at. Why do people do this?

Speaker 2:          02:38:03       Yeah. I'm the obsessive aspect of it, the obsessive aspect of it and the addictive aspect of it. Yeah. Hmm. That's interesting man. Well, listen man, this has been probably one of the most informative and interesting podcast I've ever done. I really, really appreciate you taking your time. And coming here and sharing all this information. I'm going to have to listen to this fucking thing three or four times to work to get all of it and, and your book. So please tell us the book again, the name and how we get, is it Amazon?

Speaker 1:          02:38:28       It's primal endurance. It's on Amazon. Uh, my website is mark's daily apple.com. So a lot of the stuff we talk about here has been broken down into blogs, was 4,000 posts over the last 10 years. Um, yeah. And um, encourage anybody to, to give it a go.

Speaker 2:          02:38:42       Well, I'm giving it a go, man. I'm, you've really convinced me. I'm sold. I'm, I'm gonna radically reduced sugar. I'm going to cut out all my grains and a, I'll keep everybody posted. Cool. I'll hold you to it, man. Please do. Please do. I really, really appreciate it. Thank you very much, mark. All right folks. We'll be back tomorrow with a Hannibal burress. See you then. Bye. Bye.
