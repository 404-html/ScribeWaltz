Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Thanks for doing this man. My pleasure. My right. Here we go.

Speaker 2:          00:00:10       Experience Joe Rogan podcast. There's only been two people ever. The dentist Mckenna's record recommended for this podcast. You and josh worker him, so that puts you in very lofty company. Dahmer. That's the way Daimler. Dame French. It's dumb air. But is that how your family pronounces it the correct way? Damers the best. But do your friends call you a dumb air buddy? Like give you full respect in the French heritage? No. No. That's a thousand years ago. They gave it up after awhile. They gave it up after they invaded Britain. Ten 66. That's clever. That's a good move. You've got a very unusual background, man. I mean, Dennis would not stop raving about you and then when I started doing research on you, I was like, you were. This is the craziest story of all time. Not not the craziest, but it's pretty crazy. You were in burning man during Katrina with you are partying and Bernie Mann with people who work in the Pentagon. Yes. When Katrina went down camp ply a gun. That is the most ridiculous thing that gives me great discomfort to know. The people who work in the Pentagon are partying at burning man rocking. We called for Blackhawks, but we got the order tonight, but that's a whole other. That's a whole story. Well, that's. We'll. When Katrina was happening, you guys were amongst the people that were in burning man, the very few that had a connection to the outside world.

Speaker 1:          00:01:46       If we had a, you know, we're. Our camp was doing the Wifi and the Internet for burning man, for the public and emergency networks, the private network. And so we had a dish and we could takeover satellites. So one of our guys took over recon satellite.

Speaker 2:          00:02:05       Is it a Pentagon move?

Speaker 1:          00:02:06       Is it depending on. Woo. So he took this thing offline and I'd actually been at a, a is NRO national reconnaissance office. I had been at an nro launch just the year before. And then I look over and I see the logo on the laptop and I say, what are you doing, you know, to this man who remain nameless. He said, shut up and turned his laptop away. And he pounded in a code and he took this thing off line and so our iridium phone rang, you know, this Pentagon wireless satellite phone that's like the, the, the general on the other side is saying what's going on and basically the, he instructed the guy not to answer. So we then had control of this thing and we could watch Katrina come in because the government wasn't doing with all this national resource assets to, to help people. And this was the frustration that he had.

Speaker 1:          00:03:06       He wanted to be evacuated to be taken out off Playa with Black Hawks and heavy duty helicopters because he had just come back from the Asian tsunami, you know, the event. And then he went straight to, to Afghanistan and then he went to Baghdad. And then he came to burning man. I looked at this man's face. It was like lying deeply, you know, just unbelievable stress. Can you imagine this was his job. He works under title 10 money, doing extreme comms, extreme emergency relief efforts. And he's invented all this shit, like cell phones that come down on parachutes that'll run for a month. And people pick up these cell phones and push a button and there's somebody who speaks tagalog the right on right there to say, what do you need? What are your. What's your position in that? Cool. That's amazing. That's amazing. Cell phones run for a month. They're like in rubberized cases, this guy has invented all this technology. So this rubber Rebecca

Speaker 2:          00:04:00       case just has a massive battery in it. Sentence

Speaker 1:          00:04:02       recharged. Yup. Yup. So this guy is really thinking. So here, here we have a natural disaster happening in our own country. You know, barreling in. Nobody at burning man knows about it because there's no cell phone service fan back in 2007. It's barreling in and 2005 rather. And we watch it coming in. Now the, the amazing thing is we, we saw you could watch a video for more, but on this screen, on this guy screen, and you could watch people walking down like we saw levy breach the first levy breach in the ninth ward or something. We saw that on the screen from, from our camp at burning man.

Speaker 2:          00:04:43       So when you say you took over satellites, satellites that are broadcasting, what is it? Broadcasting media like news, Fresno, high risk reconnaissance imagery. Okay. So it's a satellite that is like one of those spying on bad guy satellites. Exactly. Whoa. Yeah. Couldn't eat. We couldn't read. I can talk about this. Go ahead. If someone finds out about that, is that like, is this an issue? I don't think so. I mean it's something that would be really frowned upon. Well the, the phone, the iridium phone kept ringing. Yeah. It's like your dad's call and you're having a party. The neighbors are calling your dad going, hey man, I don't know what your son's doing, but uh, the lights are on, there's a million people on your front lawn and the phone just keeps ringing and you're like, ah,

Speaker 1:          00:05:30       but these guys knew who they're dealing with. This is this innovative genius type guy that is totally respected and organization. So the general that initiated the inquiry was covering for him. Oh, I see. So the general could then contact space command and say, I can't get any of.

Speaker 2:          00:05:48       Oh, okay. Okay. I see. I see. He had put the satellite in some kind of a failsafe fallback mode, so they would spend the several days trying to get back into it. Whoa. He was just like, we kept passing it and keeping them out and burn hydrazine and locate, you know, stuff on, on the Playa. Wow. So tell me all the details, but he's basically, don't you know, I'm doing this right. What, what kind of satellite Internet connection was available in 2005. It was a very small, slow upward, a little bit quicker download, but still pretty whack. Right. By that time you have the next year I think they got the big tower on the plier which had the dish. They went right to gurlack with [inaudible] three connection. But what does, what does that mean? What'd you just sick of? Really fast. A sort of, almost like a radar less.

Speaker 2:          00:06:38       What is girl girl? Oh, you haven't been out there? Ah No. You know, I love hippies in small doses. Hippies to me, like pizza. We just can't. I can't eat pizza every day for like a month I was with. But you can hang around ply a gun Pentagon people and yes, I could probably hang around your camp. Went out there with and they're dirty people with Sherpas, Sherpas, Sherpas, Sherpas, you know, they're, they're white people, White Sherpas, servers for the billionaires and they're billionaire camps, but that's too much. And they have walls of motor homes or I want to hang out with 100,000 air camp. I don't want to hang out with ability of Eric. You want to hang out with people who live in rvs and like, everybody's clean. But I don't need Sherpas will come. You know what I. here's a secret that I'll tell you on here.

Speaker 2:          00:07:27       Oh well it won't be a secret. A secret. My of my mit. So Dennis hasn't been to burning man. Dads, mechanic, good. Me and him. Same page. So I've two old guys don't want to party with young kids. So I told him that. Dan, to tell you that Dennis would only go to burning man if you went. Oh, did you do it the opposite way? That's against each other. There you go. Yeah. That doesn't work with me, but thanks. That's sweet. So I would go anywhere with him though, anywhere with Dennis. I really would go with him just to talk to them for days. Yeah. Yeah. He's, he's amazing. The world's most amazing teddy bear. Yeah. He's uh, he's. He explained the stoned ape theory in a way that I've never heard anybody explain before with science and the way that psilocybin interacts with the human mind in a way was like, oh yeah, oh, that had to be a part of it. You know, I'm sure there's many factors that led to the increase in human brain size, but when he describes it, he was like, oh, that's fucking mushrooms has to be. And you know, we were at a meeting, an event yesterday where all the silicide when research was being presented by the Johns Hopkins teams and Ucla and Madison thinks these people are doing silicide funded research to for smoking cessation, end of life, reduction of anxiety and ptsd. And this one young researcher, Matt, that we talked to, he basically said this amazing thing which was, we're not

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       plugging up neurotransmitter portals to deal with addiction here. We seem to be hitting higher order brain functions much higher rather than plugging up your desire for nicotine. We're when we watched the FMRS, when we put people under the magnet, which means put them in an Fmri try realtime brain scanning. We watched this, the parts of the brain talking to each other like the default mode network seems to be changed

Speaker 3:          00:09:25       and is this while you're under while they're on mushrooms. See, I would have to think that suicide suicide, that was the thing that would radically affect your experience because it an Mri and Fmri. Similar because I've been an MRI before. It was like bang, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang. If I was on mushrooms and I was in an Mri, I would freak the fuck out. Yeah. I've never been in a functional Mri. I've never been in Mr and Oh, I was in one less than a year ago. I had a, an issue with my back and I had a bulging disc in my back, so I had to get an examined by an MRI and you lie down on a plank, like a little skinny little gurney thing and they roll you into this tube machine that's a giant magnet and all I could think of some story that I had heard about some kid who died because they left a fire extinguisher in the room and then turned on the Mri and it sucked the fire extinguisher into the bag and killed one freak incident out of a billion usage.

Speaker 3:          00:10:31       It was like a torpedo that killed somebody. Um, but it's a very claustrophobic and strange experience. You roll into this thing and just lay there, you can't move and you can't bang, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang, kick around your head. It's all just echoing around you. I mean, you get earplugs put ear plugs on and you close your eyes and just deal with it. But I would imagine that tripping on that would be incredibly strange. So I would think if for MRI is very similar to its functional Mri, if it's the same machine, that would mean the old adage is, you know, five grams and silent darkness. Right. That's what terence always described her as kind of prescribed or buddy this is like the opposite of five grams and silent dark desks

Speaker 1:          00:11:20       like a. well maybe they've got it down to a baseball cap now. You know,

Speaker 3:          00:11:24       I don't think they do. I don't think they do. I've had two Mris actually in the past year and a half, so I'm pretty sure

Speaker 1:          00:11:30       maybe by the 2015 will all be like this is a theory that I have of where it all this is going. Then I can

Speaker 3:          00:11:36       revealed to you later. Oh, excellent. I'm absolutely interested. But what all I was thinking was that the whole experience of siliciden depends very much so on where you're at while you're experiencing it. If you're in a beautiful, peaceful place, like

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       the colors are brighter and you see like all sorts of cool visions and you have this connection to nature where you feel like you're grounded and. But if you were in like some horrible place and you were on suicide and you would be very sensitive to that horrible place, I couldn't imagine like doing psilocybin and going to like a war zone and experiencing war, you know, or, or anything else horrible like the gym. What was the movie that depicted the Vietnam fats? You know, what? Was that a Jacob's ladder? No, the ones where they got high in Vietnam on all said. Oh, what movie? One movie A. Not Apocalypse now. Apocalypse now weren't an acid. Oh, that's right. Martin Sheen was on acid when he punched him when he did karate and his hotel room and punch the mayor. I know there's another, there's a video of British soldiers on acid and the fifties.

Speaker 2:          00:12:45       You remember that. And they're all thing and they can't be made to fear the enemy or put fear into the enemy or be a part of any organization, which is what the British army was about to become. Anyway. Yeah. That's a beautiful video. I love that video. That was peace and love before the Beatles even got rolling and 59, right? Yeah. Well, it shows you also what a incredible like transformative drug that isn't really for the most part, all psychedelics have that capacity, so incredibly transformative capacity because you're here, you're dealing with people whose job is to kill folks. That's what their job is and what are they doing? They're giggling and they're falling down and they're not thinking about war. They're, they're like, they think everything's preposterous. You know? And it's just amazing when you look at the transformation in our culture from the 1950 [inaudible] to 1970 when everything was clamped down on.

Speaker 2:          00:13:45       I mean, what a radical couple of decades of change. I mean, people don't realize. I mean I trying to explain to people that if you like, I'm a technology historian, you know, I have the Dog Barn Computer Museum, I've got like 30 tons of vintage computer hardware in the barn and I've interviewed a thousand people on how did this all happen? How did the Arpanet get made? How to apple found and all that sort of stuff. And that the years between 1945 and 1970, oh my God. The, the change that happened. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. And really if you drive into a neighborhood like even around here, San Fernando valley houses built in like 1962. The only difference in technology is that there's ether net, like there's an internet, there's a network and there's computers. Otherwise House of 1970, he had microwave ovens and a cable TV in the beginning and all that sort of stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:14:39       Not a lot of difference. Just the digital tech. That's the only really big thing that's come in and that model has now spread to the whole planet. So China did it in shorter time, you know, and I lived in Czechoslovakia and they did the whole transition in like eight years. This incredible South Africans at the transition, like 15, just boom to our model shopping center, you know, off ramp, you know, wired into the Matrix, you know, consumer culture, Boone, the whole world just went bang, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang, adopting that. It's a very strange time, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. And everyone's rushing to that model. I mean, there's no, no stopping it. Well, it's, everything's tied into it now too, which is really spooky. You know, I'm absolutely fascinated by ancient cultures, by the idea that there were great civilizations that fell apart and like what caused it wasn't natural disaster was at this, was that.

Speaker 2:          00:15:36       And when you look at grain ham, Graham Hancock on last month, I've had grandma a few times. He's awesome. And I've also had Randall Carlson on who's also really enlightening when it comes to that subject because he's a true expert in cataclysmic disasters. Particularly the comment, the putative comment impairment that created all that flooding. Yeah, one of his. I mean he's, he's an expert on pretty much every significant traceable impact and it's really crazy. He can drive his suv and read land. Right. You can sort of read the teaching him about what happened. Well, he'll show you some things on satellite images that if you looked at it, you would go, oh, that's just some hills and heal. But the way he described it, he'll draw it out for, you know, here's where the crater is and this is where the craters in the middle of this ocean and this, this part of the ocean.

Speaker 2:          00:16:29       And if you follow that crater out, you realize these are where the waves hit toward the landscape apart like you're looking at a gigantic version of what you see when you see the ocean leave marks on the sand when high tide comes in, but you're seeing this unbelievably extreme version of it that probably happened instantaneously. You remember Jerry personnel and Larry Nibins Scifi classic Lucifer's Hammer. No, it's fantastic. It was about a comment impact on the Pacific and the scene. These are master Saifai writers. They both live in here in the San Fernando Valley. And this wave was a 1200 feet tall and he did. They describe it coming across the southland. And there's this surfer now, the surfers out on Santa Monica, right? Decides to take this wave. Now what's happening before the wave arrives, as the ocean is roaring at hundred miles an hour out toward the sea. So this guy has been carried out, you know, 40 miles out to sea because it's wave is sucking down the coastline, but he knows what is going on because he saw the fireball because I'm going to die anyway. I'm going to try to take this wave and this is a great scifi novel and he does it. And what happens is the wave comes across, he looks down

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       and he can, he's on the face of this wave is coming across Los Angeles and, and he's looking down at the city, you know, like 800 feet below as this wave is because he has on the face of it and he's managing his board and then he just, and he looks up and the, the, the language is great. It's like in the first interstate building, hit like a flyswatter, you know, that's a crazy way to die in the wave crashed. It went inland to like a palm springs kind of indio. That's where. And it created sort of Lucifer's hammer worth getting worth getting. And here's the reading. Uh, Larry Niven and Jerry poor now are the two great hardcore Saifai writers. And Larry told me about 15 years ago, he said, let me tell you something, uh, I was in my office when there was this earthquake, like you've been in the south line long enough, right?

Speaker 1:          00:18:47       There's this earthquakes every x amount of time and they do a certain amount of damage, like northridge was big, but before northridge, Larry sit in his office at like eight in the morning and an earthquake hits, I think it's the whittier quake or something. And the last thing he remembers this a bookshelf coming right at him. Right. And he comes to and he is blacked out. I mean, he's blacked out for a couple of hours. Right. And he has this vision comes to, he sees a spine of books and one of them says Lucifer's hammer hardcover edition. And he realizes I was almost killed by my life's work. Yes. And Lucifer. Samara knocked him out. Wow. So he bolted the shelf to the wall for the next one.

Speaker 3:          00:19:29       That's a good move. Bolting shelves. Always good move here. We started this off talking about, um, being fascinated with ancient civilizations and the fact that we don't really like, we know quite a bit about ancient Egypt in, in sort of, if you look at it, the fact that it's 2,500 plus BC and we know quite a bit. That's a long time ago and we have some pretty incredible structures are still remained from them, which is pretty amazing. But no writing. I mean just hieroglyphs we don't have books for the library of Alexandria was burned to the ground and who knows what was in that, you know, there's so much lost when it comes to ancient civilizations and one of the things that I worry about is that we're moving everything digital and everything, even more than just digital. People are storing things in the cloud like crazy and that when we get a Lucifer's hammer, it's all gone. Right. That's the thing is if we left behind some flash drives and some hard drives in some old computers and stuff and then everybody else died except for like a few thousand people that live like nomads, how long would that stuff even make it? How long would it take? We'd all be absorbed by the earth. Right.

Speaker 1:          00:20:41       You remember wally trying to get all the trash compacted and everything and he's choosing things that he would know the volley

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       of the robot from the movie, the Pixar movie and he's like, oh, keep that. You know, because he's, he's making a library apart, so he hit himself going skins of going for 50,000 years this way and the shit he's throwing away, like he does keep an ipod because it plays his favorite movie, you know, and he's able to rig it up. He's a robot, right? He's a little macintosh robot, right. But uh, it's interesting to see the pixars depiction of what is going to trash and when the earth is so toxic and is covered with trash and the people have a VAT evacuating our living aboard a ship because the earth detoxified. But we're sort of banking on the fact that nothing happens when we have like the Georgia guidestones which are dubious. It's very weird. So key population to $500,000, $500, million worldwide or something like that, you know, it's like very interesting rules to live by, but it doesn't tell you anything about how to set up solar power, you know, what is the Internet, how is it, how does it connect China to the UK, you know, there's none of that.

Speaker 2:          00:21:48       So here's an interesting thing for you. Britton, southern Britain, when Rome fell right and the Romans left, no one was there to maintain lead pipes. So the Romans invented fantastic bath systems with lead pipes that that could run cold water, hot wire, that valves and everything. It's all this stuff went to potty and the roads went bluey and the Roman roads were straight and they had these mountains on either side that you could have watchers and stuff like that. And it was super high tech, right? And then Roman went away and all this stuff just fell into ruin. And the British forgot how to make bricks. So there are no brick buildings, you know, they had to go back to knocking out stone to build the first Christian churches in England were made out of because they did not have brick technology gone. What was the classic example of like, what's going on right now is we have so many things that we need.

Speaker 2:          00:22:43       Like I had a joke that I was doing about how uh, what I thought happened with Egypt was that the dumb people just out fuck the smart people and left behind a bunch of shit that didn't understand and that if I left you alone in the woods right now with a hatchet, how long before you could send me an email, right? Like, we have so much that we rely on on a daily basis. Me, you might not understand it, but I don't understand it. Most people that use it don't understand it. One of the most terrifying TV shows I've ever seen about this as James Burke's connections, which came around 1980. And in the first episode, what you see is this British guy, you know, he's a master presenter, right? And he's walking up to a screen door on a farm and he's saying the electricity has been off for a week, two weeks, four weeks.

Speaker 2:          00:23:32       The people are starving. People are trying to leave the city. You escape the city. You managed to get to this farm. The farm is abandoned, right? You know, it's one of the places you could survive. You are coming up to the door. The people are not there. What do you do? You Go, you see this a milking machine, you can't use it. It's no electricity. You see everything that you can't use to farm even though you maybe you understand farming, but modern farming. Then you go up into the attic of the barn and you find a discarded plow from like the 19 tense. That is your tool. You have to know how to use that and how to put that onto animals, onto pulling draft animals to break the soil. You're now in the 11th century. If you can't master that plow, if you can find that plow and know everything there is to do about that technology, you're Outta luck.

Speaker 2:          00:24:26       Everything else is just trashed at that point and that would go away in a thousand years if that was still left around 10,000 years from now, there'll be nothing. No plows and knowing. So how much do you think happened like that with like ancient Egypt? I mean, how much of that stuff, just whatever they built or whatever they designed, I mean we were essentially, we have fossil remanence of their civilization. We have what, what survived and pottery form and stone form the papers all gone either burned or destroyed or thrown in rivers or whatever. There's very little. That's, I mean, how much of what we have today would be around in just like a thousand years. All the computers would be gone. Cars would be gone. You know, there's that great tv. Was it on discovery or history or they showed the earth after people are center people and man, you knew watch Manhattan, you watch the at 500 years.

Speaker 2:          00:25:23       Uh, the Brooklyn Bridge finally comes down because it's so well built. You know, the, the case ons are all incredibly strongly that the cable ties and everything. They figured it would take about 500 years for those cables to rush through in the finally the decking, whatever's left of it to come down. Nothing has nothing. But that would be the last piece in New York as this. Their skeletal framework, the blackberry bushes would come back, the streams would come back in their normal of Manhattan island, right? It would just come back. Deer would come back in and when the last things would be this, this Brooklyn Bridge coming down. That is so crazy, but that totally makes sense. I mean nothing. None of that stuff lasts. It's not going to lie. We don't build mean the pyramids. Did you know that? The pyramids. I didn't know this when we had this wonderful lecture by an Egyptologist who've worked on the Giza plateau for like 20 years and he said, we've discovered so many things about the city of artisans and craftsmen teams that built the pyramids by excavating this massive area now that they've done. He said, one of the things we discovered as the pyramids were classed clad with polished limestone and they used it all to make Cairo that chipped it all away. It and you find this in vases in China that this stuff was taken off the cladding. Is it? The pyramids

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       used to be shine. These to be like a prism, say blind you if you're coming at a certain angle in the desert, in the sun. They were just this incredible shining pyramid. Can you imagine the power on the average nomads? Seeing that with a gold cap too. There was a golden cap. So like our money, you know, with the little icon on the top. Yeah, but. And so people will rip the stuff off and they took it and it's all over the world and various holes. Assholes ruin everything. But this, this guy, he showed us this initially, he went to the Giza plateau in the seventies. He was part of some kind of a cult that believes the parents were built by extraterrestrials and he was literally in this cult and he went to see it. He was sort of like sent there by the cult, got so interested in excavation and the reality of trying to really solve it.

Speaker 1:          00:27:38       He sort of left the cult, went back, got a phd and he's been working there for 20 years and he gave us. Oh yeah. It was amazing. Wow. And he showed us, like he said, all the Hollywood mythology of slaves building the pyramids and was all complete. You know who we are. Here's, here's the plan of the city of the artisans and the construction teams and the contractors that built a pyramid, central avenue, big hospital complex, the best one in the ancient world, huge bakery. This bakery would make conical bread loaves that the guys could put a rope around, throw over their backs and then go up to the job site and they ate the bread. And then he said, we kept cutting down through sand through these clay layers that didn't see that they shouldn't be there. There's, you know, 20 feet down and there's a layer of clay.

Speaker 1:          00:28:30       They figured out the clay was from a quarry up up the Amazon App, denial rather no wrong, bring going in the wrong place. And then he said, well, what on earth is going on? And so they started excavating horizontally and they found that these were clay tracks. And they said, well, what on earth is this? And then they started seeing these. These clay tracks matter a lot there, not just leftover layers in the desert and then they map them out and there was a whole network of them and what they were were low friction slipways and so they said they put the blocks on some kind of a canvas on some kind of a thing. They had mastered low friction. They'd figured out that clay and an a layer, like a micro layer of water on it creates a hydraulic system that you can move massive tonnage on.

Speaker 1:          00:29:22       And so they built one of them using the same clay from the same quarry up the Nile they made when they brought all these Cairo University engineering students out or probably mechanical engineering and they put like a multivitamin block on canvas on this track and these guys pulled and they were able to get it up to some speed of 10 kilometers an hours. Wow. So this is how they move the volume of the blocks. Wow. And it was probably started out, you know, they've been building pyramids for a thousand years before that. And so there's the famous bending pyramid that's like not collapsed, but about two because they didn't understand foundation because you can't build a foundation for a pyramid. It's on sand. Most of them were. And by the time of Giza, they mastered it. You fill the area with water like you, you, you basically packs and down huge area, acres and acres, fill it with water. And then the teams would go on, they would pack the sand up to the level of the water, water's flat. And then when they started laying down their sort of first case ons that would evenly compressed the sands is the key thing is, is massive compressive strength evenly over the area so that the thing will not abandon fall down. Wow.

Speaker 3:          00:30:37       And they had to do it so accurately that over 2 million, 500,000 blocks or could be like such little deviation to line up at the top. And that's so incredible.

Speaker 1:          00:30:47       They learned that these guys had mastered a whole field, which we lost, which we didn't even know exist. It's sand hydraulics. So these guys were literally using hydraulic sand is a flowing things like water, right? You have an hour glass, it looks like water flowing down, but it's sand and so to, to set keystones, they would have a column, a sand get the keystone to the top and they would pull plugs out and the sand would come down and it would. The keystone would come down absolutely perfectly in the right place. San Hydraulics sound foundations, clay for slipways smart dudes.

Speaker 3:          00:31:27       Isn't it amazing when you say what you said a thousand years like they had been making pyramids for a thousand years. We can barely comprehend what a thousand years. A thousand years to us is like if you want to go back to 1014, can we even like Genghis Khan Times for him? And of course theater cathedrals took a thousand years to master. Right? So think about the fact that they were doing that, making these things for a thousand years. And even though as far as we know, they didn't have electronics, they didn't have computers, they didn't have any of these things. They still have the human mind, the human mind, without electricity, without engine, the contemplate of time, and they had a culture that supported it well. They also had this incredible connection with the cosmos because of the fact that they weren't dealing with light pollution like we are. We've done a really weird thing in our arrogance. I mean, it's not arrogant that we did it. We did it out of innovation that have this burning desire to continually create new and better things. But our cities, which is the giant population centers we've ascended essentially cut off our view of the cosmos almost entirely is incredible. Dan didn't, and

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       they were entirely invested in not just the cosmos, but there are positions in the cosmos, the, the uh, the astrological charts and where things lined up and where the, the shafts in the great pyramid that would lead to various constellation and then the lay lines of Europe. And then incredible Denison. I in August for rent running around Macha Picchu and he said, we've got to find the observatory. We've got to find the observatory. And he knows this place pretty well. I had a wonderful tour of it from him and we found it and it has this rock that has all these angled pieces in and it's a star map or a big, big rock multi-tone rock, but it's carved. So if you look this way, you're gonna you're gonna position on this star and position on that star and and the and it had a sort of a portal at the top and this is what's remaining of much peaches observatory.

Speaker 2:          00:33:34       So it's like all these people have this knowledge gap as long as people stay alive and they keep innovating, they, they do it differently than we're currently experiencing it right now, but they figured out a way to do it and some really intense, very sophisticated way. And if you compare, what does that Jamie the observatory, is that it? Probably. Yeah, that looks like and the thousands of years ago, right? This is like at least a thousand years ago that much. Fifteen hundred. 1,400. Okay. So less. Less. Yeah. In fact, the Inca complexes, Dennis and I and our group are running around a lot of income complexes, including peace sack and the other places, and they, those dudes knew how to cut rock so perfectly. I mean, when you know how they did that, you know, it's not known. They could have used ropes. Have you ever watched ancient aliens?

Speaker 2:          00:34:27       I, you know, I've never seen. I've never seen that it was alien. Everything's dealings I've ever seen that show. I'm a born skeptic. I'm a Canadian, so a more skeptical. Oh, much more. Less religious. So where it is, we have a basically armchair views of America. I grew up watching all Canadians who have watch America with exhilaration and horror and admiration of your porch from our porch. Well, you know, they say there's a joke about North America, which is, there's a three story apartment block in the middle apartment is this out of control fricking party and beer bottles and crapping thrown. That's America. In the bottom is Mexico and all the beer bottles in the crap are falling on that apartment. And up above is Canada and Canadians are leaning over the balcony scene. Can You keep it down a. So that's problem was Toronto has rob Ford.

Speaker 2:          00:35:26       Oh, Toronto. And Arab for. So that's changing. You're getting more American. He'll soon be exported. Thinks so. And we should have him on the show. I would have them on the show. Absolutely. I'd them high get an absolute crack cocaine. I would smoke crack with them just to get them to do it right here on the show. Like one drug to get you in trouble. You helped Graham break is fast. Well he wanted to. He, he kept talking about it and I'm like, you want to try it? He kept looking over your way. Come on. He was great though. He took a little baby, hit another little baby hit and then he was off to the races. You can see it like the cannabinoids receptors firing and all the words flowing hours in his eyes. And yeah, he was. He became like Terrence Well oiled. Yes.

Speaker 2:          00:36:11       Yeah. Well it's back to subject this. It is amazing when you think of the fact that these people did have these incredibly sophisticated societies, we just don't recognize them as incredibly sophisticated because they didn't have electricity because they didn't have the combustion engine. Those are are our benchmarks if you don't have that, you guys are dopes, but meanwhile the reality is they had some stuff that we still are perplexed by some structures that have taken decades upon decades of some of the greatest archeologists, geologists, and engineers to try to even get a theory as to how they put these things together and that's all we've got. Right? I mean, we've got some pretty good information on a lot of things like you're talking about the sand hydraulics, but as far as like the ability to go out and build one right now, good fucking luck, but like it at one of these ruins so soon as the Spanish arrived in England lands right?

Speaker 2:          00:37:07       What they did was have the inca knocked down their own temples. Oh God. And then those stones were carried down fucking white piano to build a Catholic cathedrals. Then the next earthquake happened. The Catholic cathedral is were flattened and ink and complex. We're fine, you know, because there's 12 to 14 degree angles on all the windows. It's built to survive earthquakes for a thousand years. It's incredible. And the water channels that has been no maintenance for 500 years, they're still pumping out billions of gallons of water for all of these firearms. Amazing, amazing and and I stood there in awe of a 30 ton block. You could see this. This was above Cusco and this block was carved like doop, doop, doop, doop and does that mean tube, tube, tube, tube, angles, angles but flat faces and then there was a block next to those was perfectly matched, I mean no gaps.

Speaker 2:          00:38:05       And then the one down below I set the stone. Mason stood and studied a pile of rocks and in his head, because he was such a deep, profound present engineer expert, he saw the pattern of these rocks and how they could fit together with the least amount of cutting and with perfection. These guys had this in their heads and they could like bone. I know cut that. Take that one. That's going on the center and then they had to lift them and they had to cut them first and then lift them into place. They had to be perfect. So this guy had three dimensional mental acuity that blows our minds. I mean any kind of world of warcraft player couldn't navigate that space. The three dimensional acuity of these people. Yet it really is incredible when you think of what has all been accomplished long before people invented the Internet long before people were going to the library to get their books on all this stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:38:59       Or maybe they were, you know, library of Alexandria, of course right now, but it's, it's thought of as primitive, you know, we still think of them as primitive and when you compare the, the work of John Anthony West and Graham Hancock and Robert Schoch and all these geologists and people that are pointing to all these erosion, mark's going, you know, we might be dealing with some really ancient civilization mixed in with some other civilizations that are like, well everyone wants to date Egypt around the same time, but there's a growing movement of people that are saying you're dealing with some pretty significantly different structures. I know Graham cat covered in your show him your last show. It was just fascinating. Thousands of years of rainfall erosion in the last time there was rain fall in the Nile Valley was 9,000 BC. And did you know that? When I was visiting the Sphinx about 20 years ago, our guide said, did you know that this thing has been for 10,000 years?

Speaker 2:          00:40:00       But in the last 15 it has been so damaged by Cairo city sanitation department raising the water table. So every he said, every toilet flushes in the city of Cairo is taking a chunk out of the interior of the Sphinx. So we are pumping in paraffin wax to keep from coming apart. So I mean, look at the destructive power of our civilization, just haphazard and, and the archeologists that gave us this tour of the Giza plateau, excavation, they, he said, look, here's modern Cairo coming up over top of our excavation site. We can excavate under that notice the Warren of chaotic streets and bad planning and pad everything. And on top of this beautifully thought out, you know, fully functional city of artisans and construction people. How have we evolved? Tell us the acef fascinating that this really wacky city is over one of the greatest ancient cities ever.

Speaker 2:          00:41:02       Like Kairos is another example. Yeah. So how are we evolving exactly while we're doing something? Because the Mexico City during the Aztecs, if they knew what we know now or the incose, they would have known the Cortez was an asshole and they were shot him and they would have never thought he was a warrior. That was part God on a horse. You know, they would have not had any misconceptions about him because they would have known what a horse is. They would have had the internet. No one horseshit is horseshit, but yeah, literally and figuratively. Right.

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       So here I want to propose you a theory. Okay. That's kind of captivated me and it's partly woo and it's partly science, but it'll really is my favorite stuff. It's fear. Favorite stuff. I like half, so half of woo. So yeah, you got a t shirt that has the blue on the front wheel on the backs of you turn around your woo. But. So that the Eleusinian mysteries, you know about the La one and mysteries. Yes. So they ran for 1700, 1800 years. They ran, they started out before Greece. The Greek civilization explain people what it means, what it, what it was. It was a kind of like a burning man or more serious than I'm burning man was an initiation ceremony that happened at elusive in Greece and it was run by women, sort of high class women. They were kind of a monopoly.

Speaker 1:          00:42:22       And when they finally got this thing cranked up, because we don't know much about the earlier history, but you can go to the temple of a to date was destroyed in the fourth century by characters that I want to bring up later. This is why we might be still in the culture of the people destroyed ellipsis. So they built this thing. So the fully powered appaloosas theme park transformational experience was a thousand person buried temple could, could house a thousand initiates buried under the ground so the people couldn't see out. So they were totally in an internal process. The initiates came from all over the Mediterranean. They included Roman emperors, philosophers, etc. And you had to go to a loose once in your life because the thought was you then became a human being. So they cAme off their boats, they landed, they wore the sink garb.

Speaker 1:          00:43:15       They had a fasting diet. Sound familiar? They say I had a fast ramadan. It sounds like a. What I would say today, it sounds like people who are doing initiatory practice iowasca for example, people are going to mecca to see people wearing the same clothes. Exactly, bring them down and so the initiates would walk through villages and the villages would come out and their job was to cat call to to swear and bring the people down. Say, oh, you've got a big nose. So, so if it's a noble person who was a lot of wealth, they're getting screamed at by villagers and they get knocked back to la, knock them there, their ego out and and to dissolve them. Basically a boundary disillusion exercise. They were walking next to fields which had wheat which had tiny mushroom like purple. It's a purple. I'm a brain is shot today, but it was basically a rust that would grow on the wheat that was used to make the chi keon drink that would be given to the initiates after nine days or eight or eight or nine days.

Speaker 1:          00:44:20       So this was like some ergot based forgot basis in there. Gotta mean sort of an earth based. How do we know this? Because I thought that was like a giant mystery as to what they were taking. Like some folks thought that it was suicide and some people felt it was an erg. Got beer, there was some sort of an origami beer, I mean, hoffman's book, he talks about it apparently being in ercot beer of some sort, but there was definitely an inefficient potion that was extremely powerful. But what makes you think that it was what you're saying? Um, because you can find this in the area of alyssa's today. You can find, and I'm no expert. I mean you should have an expert on this, on the show. I've read a number of books about this, but, but when I pieced this together, so there's a fantastic book called psychedelia by patrick lundberg that came out last year.

Speaker 1:          00:45:07       He paSsed away. Unfortunately the author is quite a young man, but in the first chapter he details this and what he says is the initiatives would come in, they would go into the temple. They were on this fasting diet, the temple of the people who are running the temple. It was sound and music. It was all factory smoke color and they were driven to this intense state. And then they were given the kike ian. And I think they, you know, a philosophy, greek philosophers and others have written about their experience it appaloosas and they would emerge a really an incredible, maybe they got incredibly high, maybe their boundaries or dissolve, but they emerged with visionary, uh, coming back with vision of what to do, what to do in their world. and when they, when they went home, they boarded their ships and whatnot and they went home.

Speaker 1:          00:46:02       And what did we see happening in that period? Greek theatre, mathematics. The academy road construction had hydraulics, uh, the idea of a city organizational structure, the republic, the idea of polity, the idea of representation. And the indian mystery school was just one of many that were going on. But ellis was a big deal, right? Looses was, was destroyed partly in some periods and then a roman emperor would, would reboot it. And, and finally, and I think it was the end of the fourth century coming in from the north were sort of the savage germanic tribes that were basically taken out the whole western roman empire. And guess who was coming in from The east black robed christians were described as, you know, cranky fellows with a real sort of obsessive perfectionist, reductionist kind of negative. They were described as really nasty characters. They formed this compact and together they destroyed the temple.

Speaker 1:          00:47:08       That elusive. So my woo woo theory is, are we living in an inferior culture that has no initiation, replacing initiation, powerful initiation with what you know, all these other structures of, of abuse and usury, church structures, corporate structures, commercial structures. Are we juvenile in? Are we were we made juvenile? But the fact that we didn't have a powerful initiatory experience at dissolved our boundaries that that opened us to vision that that made us human beings certainly think that's very arguable. It makeS a lot of sense. I mean, if you, if you compare our resources to their resources, what we've accomplished and what we've managed to fuck up in comparison to what they managed to create with no combustion engine with no hydraulics with them, of course they had slave cultures and there were a lot of, here's, here's the other thing and you should ask graham when he's next on that.

Speaker 1:          00:48:05       I'd love to, to hear his response to this. What did you have before the rise of civilization? Especial in The mediterranean, you have the upper paleolithic, you had village cultures. Tribal cultures had quite a bit of conflict but quite a bit of advancement, but that was thousands and thousands of years and then suddenly and for sure they had some kInd of initiatory experience for their youth, especially for young man because as we know, you know in, in, excuse me, in cultures of indigenous cultures that still have an initiatory practice. I think that's a very important part of life. Having some very clear graduation pRocess and we have it throughout schools. We have it in grade school, we have it in martial arts, martial arts, jujitsu and martial arts is where we're bringing it back, right? Strong initiation because you know, you probably see this because the people that haven't had that, they think cruz a loss and they know the ones that have been very apparent, you know, pampered and helicopter parenting.

Speaker 1:          00:49:16       We all talk about thIs and they now talking about the hoop jumping circus train circus pig. Kids that upper middle class parents say, jump through this hoop, jump through this hoop, you know, there are three or four years old and they're jumping through these hoops because why? Because they're being prepped to get into top level university. And so they jumped through all these hoops and there's a, a professor at harvard written the book about all this and he said he's watched and his incoming classes of these kids that are really good at achieving the goals, but they can't deal with ambiguity. They can't deal With irony. They can deal with creatIvity, creativity. They just living outside of the box. Right? So they're gonna jump to, you know, the investment bank or. But they're not very functional, so because they've not had a practice of initiation and if not have a leveling practice of boundary dissolving practice.

Speaker 1:          00:50:07       They've been in this programmatic evolution and it's dangerous. I think that there should be some sort of graduation process for various stages in your life that sort of establish the fact that you've learned from your mistakes you've grown, you've achieved in, you've gotten through some. You've overcome some adversity in your higher. I got it through scouting and Canada because we had a total wilderness situations where we have a bunch of us almost died a couple times. You know, we are out in 45 bulleit below a cracking cold january and we were in a snowshoe can hike with a 60 pounds of birch bark vog logs in our backpacks to tough on ourselves. It was just during no adults and we were climbing over a mountain range and we this, the cold snap came in and I remember, like I said, we're this close to hypothermic.

Speaker 1:          00:50:57       Somebody dying in this group of like six or eight of us or 14 years old, whatever. Because I went out to take a leak one night and you can imagine you're wearing jeans. I mean this is the seventies, you know, we don't have proper clothes even. And I took, I sat down on this rock and I took a leak and then I came back, pass him the next day. I mean my, my piss was freezing on the way out and I realize it's a dead stallion is frozen, solid wildhorse frozen solid, you know, dead. And it was a rock. I thought it was there. I sat on it and we saw wolves and they were really skinny, you know, in the distance. And we realIze we are really close to this is, you know, if somebody goes into hypothermic shock in that environment, you're done, you're done. And another time we were hiking on the west coast trail and vancouver island. We made a wrong turn and the whole group, we found ourselves in this, you know, this rock outcropping with a tide coming in and storm surge and we had to cling onto this thing all night and we couldn't set up any kind of camp. And it was like those were important experiences,

Speaker 3:          00:52:03       rights of passage, overcome adversity, all those different things. I think they should probably be engineered into our cultures and our communities. I have a theory that goes along with your theory. I think your theory is probably absolutely correct that we are a in some ways less sophisticated or less advanced society, at least less what will we will most certainly more materialistic, right? Most certainly more dependent upon the internet and most certainly more dependent upon computers. Technology. I have a theory about people, and this is a very, very shaky, but here's my theory. My theory is I think that everything is natural and I think that all behavior like wolves chasing out the beta and the alpha taking over, I think like, you know, birds of prey, feasting on other birds and bears eating salMon and all these complex ecosystems that we see all over the world.

Speaker 3:          00:53:01       We just accept them as being natural because they're a part of the world that we didn't alter. But ourselves, we don't look as natural because we've altered ourselves. But I think we are entirely natural and I think our society and our civilization and our as fucked up as it is, it's also natural and I think the purpose that it serves is we live to give birth to technology. Marshall mcluhan said that human beings are the sex organs and the machine will hold. And I think that what we're doing right now by our obsession with the newest greatest iphone, elon musk just released a tesla that goes zero to 60 in two seconds. Oh my god. It's amazing. I have to have it. And by continuing to be obsessed with acquiring the latest and greatest gadgets, we push that innovation further and further. We fuel it with money and that eventually it's going to give birth to an artificial life form. It's inEvitable. I think it will give birth to the next thing. and I think we are like a caterpillar that is becoming a butterfly and we have no idea what we're doing. We're just in the middle of doing it and we're just like, oh, so much better. Back in the old days when we chopped wood. And the reason why we think that is because we know inevitably that we are, we're not going to last. We know that it's just a matter of x amount of time before we're were outdated.

Speaker 1:          00:54:24       Here's something not get to. And I, I believe you're right. And here's a nugget to add for you. That goes back to our deepest history. This goes to my practice. I do what I call indogenous visioning. Sometimes in science is called thought experiments or get duncan experiments. But I can close my eyes mostly closed eyes and I could go into worlds and that's what I've been using to design the spacecraft for nasa and origin of life. I work in the origin of life field and I sort of visualize molecular storms and flows and all that stuff because I have this practice of just doing it and I'm not taking anything just doing it. And what happened about two years ago, I was reading an article in science that all. It was an article. It was about as like we found a femur bone that was this small, just a few send parsh portion of a centimeter, a female meters.

Speaker 1:          00:55:17       It's like quarter of an inch long or half an inch long and that it's a femur bone from our ancestors. The ancestors of all monkeys, primates, lemurs, all of them, all of us students. It's our common ancestor is $55, million years old and then they had an artist's conception of this thing that would've been about two inches long and they said, well, our ancestor lived in the forest canopy and ate insects. We are insectivores. So I closed my eyes and I said, okay, I want to go back there. I want to do an endogenous thought experiment in science and see what comes in from the ether. What was our life like fan because that's a big clue of who we are and where we're going. And I had this go into a kind of a dream state serve meditation and breath work and when I go into the dream state and I see this branch at dawn and this a ball, a ball of us all clumped together because insectivores, they protect each other by going close warmth and all that stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:56:22       And I watched as this young proto primate polar herself away from the ball. So story always comes to me to do this kind of shit. And she's creeping out on the limb at dawn. Why? Because she sees a glistening globule of something. and why is this important? Because that's sugar. That's tree sap that comes out at night and the diet of these insectivores are uh, leaves and flowers and stuff and catching like a dragon fly, which is a major kill for protein and sucking down tree sap. So it's like fries, a burger and a shake diet. Let's our diet and an incentive or diet. And she's creeping out on the limb and she's sucking down this glob. You'll have sweet. And one eye is looking back to see if the somebody in the community notices her because she'll get busted, sound familiar the other eyes looking forward on the limb and it sees this very trippy scale pattern, this trippy pattern of color.

Speaker 1:          00:57:24       She doesn't know what it is, but what it is, it's a tree snake. And the tree snake was this sole giant predator that survived the impact in Mexico that killed the dinosaurs. And then we rose after that. Although he may have been earlier, the tree snake is on the branch waiting for her, waiting for her and she. So she's getting high on all this sugar because we still get high on sugar. Here we are drinking our coffees right with our sugar. And she's watching that and that trees, that pattern of scales is evolve to mesmerize her. It's totally there to captivate her. Why? Because of the head is under the branch. The head is about to come up. If she doesn't snap out of and leap back, it will snap her ass down. So this happened for tens of millions of years. This is coevolution. What I believe from that.

Speaker 1:          00:58:18       That vision that I had was I said, Oh my god, this is why we're mesmerized by screens. We're the only animal that is mesmerized by this screening of a phone or you know, texture patterns, movies, moving images. It's totally hardwired into us. We're also terrified of snakes. I mean, we have a hardwired circuit in our brain that if you see something that looks like a snake, you just jumped in voluntarily, right? That's in there too. I thought that serpent on that limb, that coa evolved our brain to vision. That gave us color vision. That gave us a three d high acuity, a vision that we were talking about the ancient peoples because we could see incredible pattern. Why? BecauSe we evolved for for $30 million years with those guys. We had to solve that problem and the evolution for 30 million years. That's a lot of time.

Speaker 1:          00:59:11       It's a lot of programming, so a lot of brain development because the ones that got snapped down weren't as good and so good old fashioned darwinian evolution and I sometimes have these conversations with what did I call them, andre, so I know mother nature or the guy in planetary plant bolus and I said to her at one point, I said, you co, you use this technique to evolve us to evolve our vision so we could drive cars and we could create media and all this sort of stuff, but it is now coiled around the planet, technologies, coil around the planet, squeezing out the lifeblood of the planet. And I asked her, does this bother you? And she said, no, as long as you do the prerogative of my prerogative of life's prerogative, find me a new home. I must make a copy. So what life does this, this, this planet is a womb and it's a two k.

Speaker 1:          01:00:08       This is all just a crazy vision. You crazy vision. It's a womb and attune to home. You're talking about space travel, interplanetary space travel. Yeah. And what we've done as a species in it. So I do a lot of this work for nasa of designing strange space, craft and art. Exactly. Is your educational background when it comes to that stuff? That stuff? It was, you know, it was started out as good old usc trojan, you know, graduating in electrical engineering and the eighties. But of course there was hardly any software out at that time and I was trying to do artificial life in 1987. Can you imagine this on computers at usc connected to the arpanet and it was too soon. So I restarted at 22 years later and I made a project called the evil grid but it was too fricking soon. So I.

Speaker 1:          01:00:56       So you're kind of like the, like the virtual reality. People were also too soon. They were. And in 1993, 94 we all read snow crash and we read near romancer and all those sorts of things and we watched a, you know, a minority report and all that sort of stuff. But I actually started organizations to kickstart virtual worlds on the internet in 94 95. And we have the first conference that I wrote, a book called avatars and help to network together and get all these people in the same room that we're filming avatar, cyberspace and three dimensional, you know, move through and you see objects, fish and people and whatever and they talk to you and et cetera, et cetera. And that's how I got connected with terrence. Terrence mckenna, this terrance was fascinated by that. And I was the go to guy. So he came, he came to the farm and sat at our little table and I put them into these virtual worlds, but it was an amazingly powerful medium.

Speaker 1:          01:01:56       And then we spun that medium into all this work for nasa for 12 years. Using virtual worlds to model the surface of mars, for example, and a rover and how it would work. The rigid body dynamics of wheels driving in bulldozers on the moon and stuff like that. And how do we build moon basis. But we could use three d graphics, you know the serpent. Again, our ability to create these worlds to figure out how a vehicle would work on another planet before we built. We built banta any metal, but it turns out, coming back to the life propagation thing, if you go to the curiosity rover or the two rovers on mars and you take you a screw gun, if you were there, you know, hopefully the vehicles are dead so you're not caught on camera, but you. You drop the belly pan off of them inside.

Speaker 1:          01:02:48       There's a dozen species of bacteria that are just there for the ride. They're inside the vehicles. They can't be knocked out any clean room and they're dry, but there are life, so there's life on mars is. This happens to be in the bodies of our space craft, so there's no way avoid to avoid that really no way. There's no way to. And there's certain species of bacteria that will always be present and in fact the jpl vacuum chamber and where they do the final prep for some of these missions. They found that because they had created the vacuum chamber and the clean rooms, certain types of bacteria evolved to be good at living in those. So they already good at hitching a ride. So of course they're inside the vehicle on there on mars now outside of the vehicle, there's radiation and stuff that make it impossible for them to really spread and get into soils and stuff where there was a

Speaker 3:          01:03:41       fascinating podcasts from radio lab about the galapagos islands and about how many invasive species have found the way to the galapagos, even from just the heels of people's feet having seeds ground into their pattern of their shoes and that sometimes the seeds will get into these grounds and then these invasive species will start growing and

Speaker 1:          01:04:07       and jeff goldbloom and jurassic park, he says, life will find a way out or something like that. What they were trying to say is

Speaker 3:          01:04:14       there really is no clean. Like this idea that you're not going to. That a human being entering into some particular environment is going to not leave a footprint like it's not. It's not happening. You know that just by virtue of you being there, your bacteria or disease and we're

Speaker 1:          01:04:30       carrying around in a single celled organisms, bacteria to help us digest food and stuff and that the body load of that stuff out. Numbers of the number of humans that have ever lived, we're just in some sense, here's a joke for you. So we come, we rise, we don't do the deed, we don't create life off the pilot. We just sort of go away. Planet goes on, runs down 5 billion years from now, the sun is a is a red giant and it's expanding and and we come, the earth comes and it scrapes the outer corona and it starts breaking apart because that's probably what happened and the crust comes apart. Now of course we know that bacteria can survive and all these crustal rocks on maybe traveled to other source systems, but my prediction, the surface bacteria will say, hey guys, and the ones that are five kilometers down or three miles down said, hey guys, listen around a billion years ago or 600 million years ago, there was all this surface gigantic plants and labels and dinosaurs and stuff, and there was one species that did technology and they even took it out a little bit and then they just blew it and went away in the five kilometer deep.

Speaker 1:          01:05:43       A Bacteria will say, you're kidding. That was going on. No one told us, you know, that was happening on the surface. We're, we're used to just being bacteria on planets that never go any further than just the bacteria phase.

Speaker 3:          01:05:58       Well, the primary idea about how life gets moved around about the galaxy is asteroidal impacts, right? Like the idea of panspermia like that, much of what is life sustaining exists on asteroids can be no acids and water.

Speaker 1:          01:06:15       It was, it was a theory put forth, I think in the seventies versus initially sort of panned, but month now we're discovering media rights that have come from mars and landed on ice caps on earth and go in and realize, no, it's quite possible that things hitched a ride and that mars would have cooled sooner, had a liquid ocean, sort of more stable environment sooner than earth would have. So if life arose on mars and got some impacts and blew off some crustal material than we could be all martians.

Speaker 3:          01:06:45       Yeah. Yeah. That was the idea. Right? Well, if that's the case mean isn't the rover, uh, just a very microscopic farmer that. I mean, it's not an asteroid, but it is or something that came from one body and is now occupying another body and it has life on it.

Speaker 1:          01:07:02       So here's the other part of the story. So perhaps, and this is all woo woo, but the bacteria in the mars rovers are communicating with the maras bacteria and saying, listen, you know, we got life started on the earth. We went up to a certain point where we had trial of bites and we had deep swimming things and they weren't really evolving. So we ordered an airstrike, knocked him back and then we got things on land that crawled, but they just basically all he did was eat and shit, you know, and they got big and whatever, but they weren't going anywhere. So we ordered another air strike, kill off the dinosaurs, and now we've got this new thing, these primate things. But we don't know if they're really gonna go anywhere. So we just might order one more air strike. And to start with arachnids, let's, let's do spiders. The next time we gotta we gotta find one that's going to do the job of getting life spread. You know,

Speaker 3:          01:07:55       so you think that that's where our primary objective is to get off this planet and the spread life throughout the galaxy. See,

Speaker 1:          01:08:00       I Think that life life is so powerful. I mean life it, it pushes into new environments from early thermal springs on volcanic islands and it figured out this is the work I'm doing with my colleagues at uc santa and nasa and elsewhere. So to try to figure out a model of how life started in those volcanic springs in those early on, we've come up with a model. We were just actually submitted our paper this week on that model, but life pushes its way in life. Had to learn in that model to survive in the oceans and then it could spread. And these little bubbles that are like pre early life, really fragile and don't have much of a genome, but they can persist long enough. They can get to the next island. You know, life will find a way like jeff goldbloom said, but look at where life has gone and missing.

Speaker 1:          01:08:48       Incredible as you say, if we are spreading wings of the living system, we are a magnificent creation of that. I mean we're, we have the potential to spread life everywhere. And one of the other projects I'm working on asteroid capture and retrieval. No, if you're wanting to hear about that. Yeah, sure. That's a mechanism to actually spread life in the large scale. You know, even though it's indirect, so you know, nobody's going to fund a project to spread life into the solar system or not so visionary, you know, we're pretty pedestrian than we do things for business reasons or whatever. So there's this whole new space movement that's come up, you know, space x and elon musk, all these private entrepreneurs. They're proposing how to get to mars and stuff, right? nasa still in the game, even though they can't launch people, you know, they're going to be using space x and a few years.

Speaker 1:          01:09:44       So nasa has put out this call for, well, let's see, what can we do with the human crew? Well, we can, uh, back in 2007 when they were going to shut down the shuttle program and that was on the books. I worked with a team that worked with headquarters to design what's possibly the very first, you know, we can even bring up that video, how to get people to an asteroid, how to land a human crew using the hardware that nasa wanted to build, which is called constellation at the time. And it turns out it's a tricky thing, you know, who is it? The movie, the deep impact movie? Uh, you mentioned Bruce Willis. He had one and the other one was morgan freeman. There was, there was two, there was a deep Impact and there was harm again. So what we said is, you know, that's all well and good, but how do you really do it?

Speaker 1:          01:10:37       And it turns out that an asteroid even that's a half a mile long, has almost no gravity. So you're not, you're not actually going to as your video that this is it. Jamie's put it up here. Jamie has put it up. So there's almost no gravity. So it's very difficult to land on, so that's a really big object, but then it's going what, like 45,000 miles an hour or something. Then It's rotating and it's, you know, so it's spinning and it's moving, it's moving. So here's our craft. So it's like a football because I was like a space potato. So here we are coming down and we're using our radar to trying to find a spot that might not be so crumbling because these often rubble piles and this is going to be people are going to land. This is a human mission. So let's see the ring of airbags that allows a soft contact, the vehicles under thrust and it's watch this.

Speaker 1:          01:11:25       Here comes a penetrator. Amateurs coming out, there's a pen of trauma. It's like a boom penetrates on the edge of edge of a rope in the penetrate amateurs or to try to grapple the surface. You get tension. If you've got tension on three or four year lines like a rock climber, you can. You've got stability. So it actually digs into the surface and the surface. I can anchor and here are the guys coming out? No sir. They're floating. They're coming out on handrails. They got nice earth flag. They're saluting. This is our design from 2007, which was done for a nasa headquarters study for the administrator actually. And uh, anyway, so that was done. Uh, I unimed barcode it so it was so controversial at the time because the whole bush agenda was to go back to the moon and this was like another target and I thought, you know, we need to go somewhere else if, if human beings are going to ever go to mars, why don't we go to an asteroid?

Speaker 1:          01:12:21       No, this is, this was running around the community. There's sort of an asteroid underground and you know, our center director was one of those dudes and I was sitting in his office and he's a two star general. He said, well you can, you can go public with it because you can't get fired. You're know, you're not a civil servant. So I did. So I lined up space.com and seen it and you know, popular science was on the cover of popular science and we put that out and we said, here's our study, here's how we grapple, you know, we'd talk with an asteroid and we get a human crew, et cetera, et cetera. And that kind of goes into a black hole because, you know, nasa sort of got that kind of institutional thing where they do a lot of studies, but we had done it in public and it actually shaped it, pushed the space industry as I forgot about is 2007.

Speaker 1:          01:13:08       I said, ah, you know, it's out there. If you google humans on an asteroid, it'll come up. But turns out people were watching that. I'm looking at that. We just put it out there. And a guy at, I think it was jpl, saw that baCk in the day and then he designed the next mission. You sort of an outsider, the student at the time. And he said, wow, this is really cool. We should be doing it as an agency. And he came up with, couldn't we bring an asteroid closer to the earth so the crew doesn't have to go so far with what? LiKe pull it closer to closer to it sounds like a disaster waiting to happen. Small one, small disaster or a small asteroid, all asteroid, but you can land on it. You could, you could go and sample it like a geologist with your hammers, how big you're talking about when you say small, literally pretty small between like 12 feet and 30 feet long and you could land on something 30 feet long.

Speaker 1:          01:14:02       You couldn't land on that. You can do what we just saw, but the human crew could park next to it called proximity ops. Yet it could park way downstream. Turnoff. It's hydrazine jets and send astronauts over to to sample it. But how do you. How do you move something like that saved to the orbit of the moon, which would be a safer place. Put a moon around the moon. So nasa had initiated that challenge based on this work which bounced off this. This guy who said we need to bring an asteroid in the moon. And they now they have that as a direction. So a colleague and a me designed a whole system to do that.

Speaker 2:          01:14:42       A system to put an asteroid in orbit

Speaker 1:          01:14:45       around the moon. And here's the neat thing about it. We figured out, here's, here's the problem. You got to one of these asteroids, it's a rubble pile. Most. Most of the ones that we're really interested in for science, right? For sampling there 5 billion years old, there are 4 billion years old. They're collected rubble piles of pieces of the early solar system. So they're, they're fragile. And why do we know this? The asteroid that came in over Russia, the asteroid that came in over africa last year, broke up at a certain altitude so we know what pressure took to break it up so we know how much you got to push it to break up the thing up because the atmosphere did that and then it comes in and pieces and rains down.

Speaker 2:          01:15:26       But isn't the concern that you can't predict what happens when you break them up and then you might deal with a bunch of giant rocks hurling towards earth. Yeah. And that'S why it's really hard to do asteroid deflection by some kind of explosive and you're ready to to that. They want to just be able to push it or put some kind of a webbing on a graph. Changes the. If you put a rag right, if you put a webbing on it, they made us come apart. You, you can use something called gravity tractoring, which is developed by rusty schweickart and ed loo at the un, a separate separate work that we were doing with them. They have this idea of flying a spacecraft alongside something and gradually the gravity will change the orbit. What is the purpose of going to an asteroid though, or especially a human mission, like what would be the benefit of having people go as opposed to having some remote vehicle? Because it seems like as we get better and better with remote technology, you would be like a lot more efficient. It would save lives and

Speaker 1:          01:16:20       well, here's, here's the we. We were asking that same question. So initially nasa said we want to do science. We want to take samples off of something that says old as the earth are older because then for origin of life research, which I'm involved in, I get, I could get a few pounds of this material out from under this space crust that's on it, that has protected it for 5 billion years or 4 billion years. That is precious because it was what was raininG down in the skies of The early earth that was coming down to the little ponds where life may have started. It's like spinning a refrigerator all this time so it's really precious for science and figuring out how the solar system came together. So our design was to go out to the, to the asteroid, up to a thousand tons. They're all rotating. They spend one time, I'm in something like that and half a rotation a minute, put a balloon around it.

Speaker 1:          01:17:17       Just extend this airbeam enough. You've ever done any helium balloon like high altitude flight? There's no. Oh, they're incredible. I mean, julian not lives out in santa barbara is perHaps the greatest designer of these kinds of balloons and he's honored our team for this proposal and he said, look, what you do is you, you extend these air beams, you know, like the, the balloons you have at circus as the guy just like blows up along balloon and makes a dog out of it for your kid or air beams. They're the rigid parts. So you literally go out to the asteroid using xenon gas. You fill these arab beams and they pull your fabric out, you know, and there's a, there's a folder of a bunch of images of the assistant called shepherd I got and it will capture the asteroid here. It's kind of come out.

Speaker 1:          01:18:05       There we go. You can see that it's hard to. So, so this is a balloon. This is literally a balloon captures the asteroid. So the astra is now inside it and it's tumbling is rotating and there's the air beams. Those blue things is how the capture works. And here's the air flow. We may leave it on that one and we'll we can explain what we're doing. It turns out that if you inject gas into this balloon, you will gradually slow the tumbling the asteroid to stop it. Now it's stopped. They've solved. One of the big problems of capturing asteroids is to get rid of the spin and tumbling because if you can't, there's all these powerful forces. If you try to put a net around that would just come apart or terrorists. Spacecraft pieces. Okay, so you put a bubble on it. You capture an asteroid.

Speaker 1:          01:18:51       Now what? Now? What is. You'll notice in our little drawing there, we start shooting waves, the xenon gas at the Back end of it, which puts a force on it, not not a forced to break it up and enough force to shove It, and then we use the same xenon gas and our motor to keep up with it as it moves and we can use like sale power. This is like a sailing ship. We can use sale power moving gas to change its orbit and to retrieve it and bring it to move it into some other. Part of the solar system is this potential technology to avoid gigantic asteroidal impacts on earth or is it just too small? This is too small, so this is only for examining old rocks for an examining on rocks blood. It turns out that when we were investigating this further, we thought, wait a minute, what if we had a piece of a comment?

Speaker 1:          01:19:39       You know, comments are coming in the pleiades meteor shower and the land. It's that come in and they give you this nice light show in the summer. That's all valid voluble volatiles. That's water, that's methane. All this wonderful stuff. What if you had a chunk of a comment that had all this, these gases coming off, you know the rosetta mission the europeans are doing right now, they're orbiting one of these gigantic comments that has these geysers coming out that's thrust doesn't like a rocket thrust. What if you could capture a small comment from further out, put your balloon around it, capture, stop at rotating, capture all the stuff coming off and use it for your engine. You could then create a moving chunk of the early solar system who came outside of, what if we did this and what if we did that and you know, being able to do it would be cool and everything like that.

Speaker 1:          01:20:32       Will it be the benefit of getting some 5 billion year old rock at a space? Oh, here's. And again, why would you want to do it with people? Why wouldn't you want to do it remotely with machines? Well, here's where the people come in. So if you can move a basically a wet space rock, capture all the gases coming out of it. Concentrate the gases in your tanks. A human crew can dock with it saying, you move it to mars, to mars orbit, move it to the Lunar orbit. Now you've got a gas station in orbit. You've got a gas station somewhere in the solar system full of exactly the material. You need to get a human crew. They dock with it. When they get there, they refill their tanks. They now have their return fuel to go back to earth and then they fuel their lander and they go down with. They don't have to carry that stuff. You have gas stations, you have a sustainable space flight system. That sounds beautiful, but if you

Speaker 3:          01:21:28       don't send people out there, you don't need that. So you're saying we would do this because when the people were out there that way we didn't have power, but if you don't need people out there, you don't need this power. And what would be the benefit of having these people out there other than the fact that

Speaker 1:          01:21:46       do it? I think because we're exploring species that are eventually going to want to do it.

Speaker 3:          01:21:53       Right, but what are we exploring remotely with the rover? Aren't we exploring remotely with voyager? We're still exploring. We're exploring. the proposition of going to mars is so unbelievably unattractive to me. Like when I hear that 100,000 people signed up for mars and I'm like, well there's 100,000 people that would just drink draino. Those are 100,000 people that would dive into a volcano. if you can put a camera on them, what the fuck are they doing? Why do they want to go to mars? It's the shittiest neighborhood ever on earth. Imagine going to some unbelievably unhappy, an unpopulated inhospitable environment on earth. Would you go there? Would you go to someplace where you're like sleeping on the edge of a volcano, breathing cosmic gases through a fucking giant mask because you can't breathe the air. You have to have this some air tanks and you have all this gear. Just keep you alive. You'd be like, fuck no. why would I do that when I could live in Hawaii? Why would I do that when I can be in san diEgo? You wouldn't. Why would you go to fucking mars?

Speaker 1:          01:22:53       Except that there are some people. There are some crazy. People really want to see this new shit. The people that pay the $20,000,000 to build the space station, there's gonna to be hitting 50 million at some point to go around the moon. I mean if you talk to the people who went to the cost per person, 50 million. I heard it thrown around, but only rich assholes are Going to Be able to afford going around the moon then. Well, it's like in the days of great exploration. I mean rich assholes funded darwin's. Is it going to be like cell phones where it starts off with rich assholes like Michael Douglas in wall street with the big brick. Huge on that. Eventually on the miracle mile show. Yeah. You go to third world countries and everybody has a cell phone. It's going to be like that. Is that true though?

Speaker 1:          01:23:37       Because it's very disturbing to me that people aren't more up in arms about the loss of the space shuttle and. But the loss, lack of funding. That was crazy. it's so crazy, but it's so confusing because every movie from when I was a kid or even television shows. You remember space 1999, 1999. We were living in space. Nineteen 99. What happened? What was it? Two thousand 14 and we don't have an have an active space program. We don't. And because there's fundamental problems with the economics, but even space x, so space x, what they dId. What elon did down in el segundo here, he said, okay, well we're going to do is make a low cost launcher, gonna up tHe same engines on the second stage as we have in the first eight, not to fricking types of engines with lockheed martin and boeing launchers like they're so complicated.

Speaker 1:          01:24:27       Why? because they're government contractors. They're going to have to bill a lot more money. They're going to overbuild the government for being. That's what it was. Oh, it's incredible. So it stifled innovation. The fact that we're getting money from the government. Yeah, because it's government contractors. So what the government did in the 19 twenties when aviation was just starting out, they gave these contracts with these little fabric error companies to run postal mail. They invented air mail. So they said, well, we'll create a new kind of male called air mail for the post office. It doesn't go by horse and buggy or train or whatever, and these little companies got enough finance from that that they started running air mail around and they became continental airlines and united airlines and all of them came out of that thing by moving it to private enterprise. So it nasa did and it's great wisdom.

Speaker 1:          01:25:16       Sometimes it has great wisdom and created a program in the two thousands and the arts to do this. So you've got space x now and you've got orbital sciences at least, but what? They're not inventing much in the way of new tech. They're inventing a reliable low cost launch or just like the soviets head in the sixties and still have proton, you know, low cost made an assembly line. You look at the air and erica mush factory in Russia that makes the soviet boosters and, and how they make this, the soyuz craft. It's like henry ford's assembly line, low cost, high reliability, you know. So we had lost that culture and now it's coming back with space x. But the economics are still really rotten. So it's coming back because of private funding and the private sector, private sector because of competition, because of competition and innovation coming from silicon valley and other brains than people who work for large aerospace.

Speaker 3:          01:26:10       So it's kind of another example of bureaucracy and government sort of getting in thE way

Speaker 1:          01:26:15       progress. Well, in this case they got out of the way of progress and they said, well, we're losing the shuttle anyway. We'll create this small program relatively small where we'll fund the winners of the competition. So somebody. It was kind of like the x prize, right? This idea of challenges and prizes in the darpa prize and that's created a huge amount of innovation that's really worked. That's been a government thing that worked because they said, well, a cure to new astronaut glove or self driving robot that can track the.

Speaker 3:          01:26:45       So the highway. But so much military technology came out of the apollo missions means so, so much of from the space race between us versus the soviets. So much innovation came out of it and so much of it was was very valuable as far as military. why don't I just don't understand why that didn't continue. It seems like that would be a no brainer, like there will be a very important part of what the military would want and who gets more money than the military. The military against an ungodly sums

Speaker 1:          01:27:15       cash. They're really, really inefficient at delivering programs. they have a high cancel rate and when they cancel a program, it's $100,000,000,000 of loss, but they seem like they've just stopped and what the military has done with the dod has done the same thing. Nasa is doing the public sector chip manufacturers, everything from laptops to whatever are so much more advanced than what the pentagon or nasa can make that they just use off the shelf. It's called cots commercial off the shelf and so they're not innovating. They're just using laptops, you know, and they're using standard stuff they're getting from industry because the industry is so far ahead. Back in the fifties they were ahead in the sixties. Now industries are so freaking far ahead like tesla's batteries. I mean, who can. Nobody's going to create something is superior. Is that right? Or not? Anytime in the near future. Yeah, there everyone's goes by those standards.

Speaker 3:          01:28:10       Do you think that there is a way that we can kind of get back on track because of the private sector being involved in space travel and we can really start saying man, space travel to like we really can make up for that hiccup where we thought we would be with the shuttle down to the and then with only cost 50 million original movie alien. What year was that Based in [inaudible]? 80 two. No, 79. Yeah, it was 79. 80 nine based on. It was based on not that far in the future based on 2020 or something goofy like that. But it wasn't a fee.

Speaker 1:          01:28:43       And you know, blade runner, 2019. Los angeles raining and sidebars and stuff. yeah. Yeah. No, we're.

Speaker 3:          01:28:52       Well isn't that still possible? And then what we were talking about before about the creation of artificial life and the exponential growth of technology, if you factor in those little things, it might not 2019, but it might be 2000, 29. I mean, they very well may have artificial life that's indistinguishable from you are on in another two or three decades. So that's very possible, right?

Speaker 1:          01:29:13       No, no, it's not. It's really not. I've spent at least 10 years trying to figure out why technology and biology are counter pose systems. Why one doesn't do the other very well. So for example, um, I do a talk now and then at the singularity university, I haven't been there for a couple of years, but my talk is why the idea of a singularity is really not possible and I can show up possible not possible with technology we have now.

Speaker 3:          01:29:48       Yeah. But what does that mean? I mean, when you say not possible, if things continue to go along the same exponential rate of progress, right? If it continues to go, it's sort of, I mean has to reach some sort of an end point, right? I mean it has to continue to innovate, continue to grow as long as we have the physical materials.

Speaker 1:          01:30:06       Parents thought that parents read a lot of science articles and popular science journals and I remember sitting with him in his house in Hawaii, you know, up half the night trying to to explain to parents why this idea was not feasible. Why is that? Well terrence, yoU know, you see we just done a whole virtual world thing. I said, terrence, the virtual world that we just were in, it's just, it's a. It's a a cardboard cutout. There's nothing in it. It's just polygons rendered in a scene by a serial processor that's getting bits from a server and it's all extremely fragile. It looks realistic to us, but it's a complete cardboard cutout and on the other hand, here's if you look down from terrence's house down, a captain cook and you looked at the pacific ocean, I said, you take a glass full of water from that ocean of what heck is going on in that class full of water and computational terms is just mind blowing. It's a computational superpower and in fact that glass of water could not be simulated accurately by all the computers we've ever built all running at once.

Speaker 3:          01:31:16       Not today, but couldn't it be a thousand years now. It's not possible to continue to stay alive and innovation continues to push the boundaries of whAt's possible as far as computing mean. you can only imagine what's capable. We're capable of 100 years from now,

Speaker 1:          01:31:30       but the thing is we're building what we're building. say for instance, the steam engine, right? The steam engine was large bore diameter pistons, right? Starting to 18 twenties and whatnot. They got smaller and smaller and better and better. So we got motors, we've got low commoditY and we got gasoline. Right? But the the piston and camshaft model is still what drives your tesla? Well, maybe not because it doesn't that pistons, and I know that's an electric motor, so it for thing, right? Yeah. It's a beautiful thing. It got miniaturize, it got better and better, but it was stuck in a rigid framework of what Its limitations work. Computers are also stuck in that framework. So for example, john von neumann, when he designed the von neumann machine and at in princeton in 1948, 49, and they built this first really reliable, no patch cord, lots of registers and memory and vacuum tubes and drums and shit. They got all working by 1952 and then they gave the plans away. Well, von neumann, the creator of this wrote, this is a contingency architecture. This is just to get something to actually work and not break down in 20 minutes and do something, but it is no way a strong architecture, especially when it comes to dealing with natural systems.

Speaker 3:          01:32:51       But. But how haven't they overcome a lot of that, at least in theory with quantum computing.

Speaker 1:          01:32:56       That's, that's all I'm. I'm not sold on that at all. I think that those are extremely specialized, very, very small processes that we don't really even understand what's going on.

Speaker 3:          01:33:07       But doesn't It open up the potential. And if you go back to the invention of the steam engine, you compare it with a tesla and you look at the x amount of hundreds of years, put a plus of innovation that led to this incredible leap in technology. When you just extrapolate and say like what we have today, you can't possibly say that like flash drives and three gigabyte processes as the end all be all. If we can't do it it with that, we're never going to be.

Speaker 1:          01:33:31       Isn't it true that perhaps in the year 2050 there will be a computer with a serial processor? Maybe lots of like might have a thousand cpas or more, but it's still doing the same thing. Why? Because

Speaker 3:          01:33:44       tied to legacy, it doesn't have to be. It has to be, well why does it have to be doing the same thing that it's doing now? If quantum computing really does turn out to pan out, he has a has to run microsoft word. Why does it have to run microsoft word? Because as the forces that are driving the evolution, it's sort of. But I mean like microsoft word today has almost no relation to microsoft word of windows 95. I mean, it's barely connectable. It's actually slower. Well, it does a lot more though, right? It does more. I mean, where

Speaker 1:          01:34:16       bloatware in. I've got a 19, 91st three, 86 computer running windows. three point one.

Speaker 3:          01:34:25       Mcguire had one of those. He kept that shit deep into the nineties, man that I had it in like 97, 98. He kept at. oh my god. Windows three point one. I booted this up the other day. It comes up. Bam. It's so fast. I'm running

Speaker 1:          01:34:38       word, I'm running. I'm doing email in aol like so quick and then I go. Then I go to my modern machines is 10,000 times

Speaker 3:          01:34:46       powerful. It's like, oh my god. Another processor glitch has happened in the wheel. Have of laconic processes happening in windows or painting slowly because this bloke layer

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       upon layer upon layer of crabs, you really have that much of a heart. What? What do you run? Windows or unix or what are you run through? Ridiculous. I mean, I'm, I'm running vms, like I run machines run like windows on top of a mack plan for him and I have tweaked and I go into all these forums and it's like, oh, you know, windows seven not on a vm has all these incredible problems with a search indexer with. You got to stop this because it'll totally choked the operating system. You got to stop that. You got to do this, so you have to. It's like an automobile in 1910. We get to be a mechanic to keep it working efficiently. The stuff is so bad, but you're running some really complicated stuff though. If you're running virtual machines, well I'm running. You're essentially running a heart.

Speaker 2:          01:35:45       You, you're running an operating system, then you're running another operating system on your operating system that's operating simultaneously and that's a lot of rich source, but it's using the same hardware. But what it exposes is the incredibly how incredibly poor we are as a species. That writing software that's good and it stays stable. So this is just super duper complex. I mean, I don't have a problem with things crashing. I mean, if you compare it to like with windows 95, used to be like windows 95, you see the blue screen of death all the time. My favorite story is if we're halfway between earth and the stars unite, we're halfway to alpha centauri and the 3000 crew are and their deep sleep and suddenly they're all woken up. They're getting out of their vessels and they go and they, they look at the screens on the bridge and they're all blue and it says press control, alt delete.

Speaker 2:          01:36:37       You will lose all data. And we realized we were running dos underneath all of this technology layer upon layer, you know, they'll be doomed. You know, I'm really confused about your, your idea because you, you, you seem to think the things we're better off when they were lIke really clunky and they couldn't run as much software and the software wasn't as complex. For example, windows xp, like when they discontinued support of xp. Oh my god. You found out there were millions and millions and accompanies that were just totally depend on it. Saying this is so robust. This is so such good software and since xp, that course they went to vista, which was a disaster and the windows seven was sort of recovery and then windows eight was sort of a disaster and now of course the evolution of mac ios is maybe a little different. It's fantastic. It's fantastic. The macro s is so much better than it ever was. Back in the day. The days, the pre intel days, the before rhapsody and before mark and unix. Yeah, it was. It was just a kluge. The macro s didn't have preemptive multitasking, no memory protection, no memory protection, all that stuff. I stayed away from max until the unix got onto the 10. One 10 came along with him a lot. But if you look at how can we be so bad and we're

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       spending the maximum amount of cash and only one or two companies and one or two ever efforts make something that's good. We're not really good at software actually.

Speaker 3:          01:38:06       You're talking crazy. This is your. You're like extreme pessimistic attitude towards innovation. Yes.

Speaker 1:          01:38:12       Growing up in the software business and well, you know, seeing how things actually get done and then you meet a futurist or popularizer who comes up with this wild thing and you say, no one's working on the project for one. No, there's no investment going into say putting consciousness and computers and does that. I always ask the question,

Speaker 3:          01:38:34       putting consciousness into computers. We're talking about a completely different thing now. Talking about software develoPment first and you cited will soft software writing, creating. You cited one excellent operating system. Mac ios, which exists right now. I mean we are. We are. We need to say no one is writing it, but it's there. I'm on it right now. It's fantastic,

Speaker 1:          01:38:52       but it's doing stuff that has been done for 35 years in different operating systems,

Speaker 3:          01:38:58       different ways, but that's one of the big things that happened when the transfer to osx came, is that there was this big. You had to get rid of all the old software because all the legacy software was no longer useful. He couldn't use it because it was running on a completely different platform. So that right there sort of contradicts your idea, doesn't it?

Speaker 1:          01:39:15       The thing is if you talk to somebody say in 1990, right? Uh, well, uh, you know, where will software evolution be in 2015? They Probably would just like your disappoint with the space program, right? It's disappointing in the software business is the software business is grinding away. This is what jaron lanier talks about. He, he wrote this thing caLled half a manifesto about 10 years ago, which is like we are so burdened by legacy and for poor practices that we just add. We're building like a tower of babel. Sometimes works well sometimes doesn't, but we add layer upon layer upon layer without thinking. So we're not building great pyramids at giza were building some kind of tower of babel of technology that's really patchwork together.

Speaker 3:          01:40:01       maybe you just know more about it than I do because when I look at it objective as someone who's not involved in the industry, all I'm seeing is continual innovation. All I'm seeing is things getting better, crisper move better, boot up faster when he went last. I agree

Speaker 1:          01:40:15       witH you on that. When we went to say the ipad and mobile devices, they could throw away all that legacy to say throw it no more compact discs, throw it in the trash, no more file systems and layer and that will build a brand new operating system running on flash memory and get rid of the crap and we'll even have new ways to do applications. So when that happened, it was like a hUge breath of fresh air. I was like, oh, there isn't 500,000 features to my mail program. It just does mail. And we dumbed it down. We made it super simple to get away from our natural tendency to. So the space station are going example, like space stations. So complicated, right? It has its 15 nations are 13 nations. There's a hundred and 50 kinds of connectors on it, right? It is designed to be remotely run without any crew.

Speaker 1:          01:41:06       That was one of the initial design criteria that we should be able to completely remotely run in the space station. So it has laptops and ancient computers and huge millions of lines of code to run the space station. So it's a huge cost, it's a huge burden to keep that thing running. Go back to skylab, you know, you're old enough to probably remember skylab was a tin can, does an upper stage of the saturn five, the beautiful saturn five most reliable booster in history thrown away. So one of the last ones, they launched the upper stage as a tin cans, space station, solar panels up super simple, huge interior space. Guys could run around it, remember how they could run and you know, a beautiful model of a space station that didn't require more than a 30 percent of crew time to sort of keep maintenance going on the international space station. The crew or are overwhelmed with maintenance chores. It's so complicated. So we built something and I asked a friend at nasa, I said, what if you put boosters on the space station and senate, tried to send it to mars to carry a crew, said they'd be dead in a month because we're constantly having to send up parts and repair shit that's breaking is not a sustainable platform currently without a huge amount of maintenance and resupply and constant management.

Speaker 3:          01:42:27       Right. But I'm like an operating system. Your, your pessimism though, because it seems to me that if you really want to like nitpick and focus on this blip in time is one blip in time where they may be peaks and valleys in innovation. Ultimately it seems to be sort of inexorably moving towards progress or moving towards complexity. Right? When did you agree with that?

Speaker 1:          01:42:50       But the progress say toward having something as good as biology. How biology operates. Operating and technology is a big challenge. Technology is this, I mean the biology of the cell and how a cell metabolizes products, how it manages its energy, it has its feedback. You know, a cell is like a huge cityscape working. It works. 90 nine point nine, nine, nine percent of the time, otherwise you'd be just mush flowing on the ground,

Speaker 3:          01:43:20       but, but isn't, are we talking about biological processes like processing proteins and things along those lines and yeah, exactly. That won't necessarily be necessary if you have something artificial silicon based, something that's running on electricity and technology and lithium ion batteries here, problem.

Speaker 1:          01:43:36       it's based on two week of a model of physics. So here's, here's the, here's the metaphor that I use and this is why computer people hate this idea life. What idea? The idea that life based on probabilistic events. So here's, here's how you digest sugar. Say you take a nice big bolus of sugar into your body. Um, you know, the, the sugar molecule will come into yourself at some point somewhere. It will hit this molecular storm of shit going on. Mostly water molecule. It will ricochet around the cell hitting just about every other molecule that it can in the cell for a second, second, half to seconds until it hits. It hits exactly the right place on a molecule that has a pocket of the sugar fits in perfectly. And that thing will cause it to band and go click, click and make it into a polysaccharide, which is an important valuable thing, but it's all done through this. What is going on as a probabilistic stochastic process. It's completely nuts, but that's how nature is. And so when you compare that process to the way a computer would work, so a computer designer would say, well that's dumb. That's a whole lot of wasted steps and computation. I'll just build a assembly line. we'll take that sugar in and along the similar line and we'll hit my thing out. Digested immediately. Well, it turns out if you do things like that, they're so rigid that they break almost immediately and in real world and nature.

Speaker 3:          01:45:10       But this isn't this if you're imitating biological synthesis or biological life. And why would you do that? If you're creating something artificial, all you need to do to create an artificial person as have it behave. Think compute, react like a person. It doesn't need to process proteins. I mean these are all. that's legacy. Isn't that like being tied to legacy? What do you throw away from what a person is? How do you define, say consciousness or I don't think you would call it a person at all. Why would you call it a person? I mean, we're not throwing it away. What I'm talking about is creating something completely unique and wouldn't have to be a duplicate of a person I would have to do is look like one.

Speaker 1:          01:45:53       Right? But then we're building cardboard simulacra again, that really aren't the real thing. If you sent that person or the New York subway system, that robot robotic entity, it will be soon overwhelmed with stimulus and programs

Speaker 3:          01:46:07       unless she conditions before it, unless you, unless you built human being one point. Oh, and you found the flaws and then built two point zero and found the flaws and keep going the same way we've described already with operating systems from 1995. A mere blip in time to 2014 and the massive amount of progress has been made since then. If you did that with computer generated or, or, or, uh, electronically generated, whatever you want to call artificial life forms that we've created. I mean, it just stands to reason given enough time. No asteroids, supervolcanoes, no ebola, right? Humans are going to get there.

Speaker 1:          01:46:41       I think it's a harder problem than we can suppose. Like nancy, it's really hard because we don't understand how basic really functions when we don't understand, for example, well, here's another example, the neuron, you know, with 10,000 connections and the body and the sodium channel and there's all these things that come out and you know, the neurotransmitters are generated into this pole and they carry the signal and everything. The neuron Is so frickin big. I do something called molecular dynamics simulation. Our team has done that where you just simulating a molecules wiggling movement, right? and they're doing this now for protein folding where they get 10,000 atoms all arranged in the right place in the simulation and the computer so that it behaves like a real protein would do, which is fold and do all this weird geometry. So they have to simulate the protein being slammed by water all the time. It's this crazy process. It might take those guys a month of computation on a computer. A 10,000 processors to simulate a couple of nanoseconds of that action because otherwise the simulated protein just doesn't behave like it really does in nature. It's that hard.

Speaker 3:          01:47:56       Right? So I think we're in agreement that replicating absolute biological processes would be insanely difficult. Saying may take forever, but my question is why is that necessary to create something new that can think for itself?

Speaker 1:          01:48:10       Because here's the problem. If you created something very small, for example, not a human walking around the New York subway system, it's something we're. What world does it live in? You know, he lives in a. If it's a robot, say it's a little insectoid robot. What world does it have to live in? Just living in this world? What do you mean? Well, if it lives, say on a factory floor, a good example, factory floor robots are really getting good. Like they can carry shit around, they can track spots on the floor and they can do all kinds of shit, but if they ever go out in the parking, if you put them out in the parking lot, you know where they're out of. They're very controlled theory in a virtual world when they're in a factor in there, they see tape and marks and fire codes and all kinds of things that create the mental model inside the robot, but if it goes into nature and the chaos of the natural world and vehicles moving around and stuff like that, you know, the darpa grand challenge, which has all these great teams making robots are self driving.

Speaker 1:          01:49:10       They found out reAl fast that we're, you know, this is hard, super hard

Speaker 3:          01:49:16       currently hard but, but, but isn't the new tesla d you could phone home with this thing and it will literally drive to you.

Speaker 1:          01:49:22       And I heard a rumor by the way, and this is maybe a, a google car in a self driving google car that on the eight 80 there was a, a google self driving car scene that had an irish setter sitting. You're done and we'll hear a dog on her, right? It was sitting in the passenger seat. There was no one else in it. And the cops were told about this. People are calling this, this, this car. There's this irish setter is driving this car and the cops come up and there's an irish setter sitting in the seat and there's no one else and they follow it and it goes to a veterinarian's office and the door opens and the dog laid it, goes into the veterinarian office and this is the rumor that I heard was somebody just didn't have time. They put the car, the dog in the car and they send it to the vet's office, you Know, which is totally in violation of any kind of.

Speaker 1:          01:50:20       Doesn't that story Itself disprove this notion that it's too difficult to do something like this when you're dealing with the real world and all the variables and all the moving parts and you just talked about a driving the fucking car. I meAn that's kind of It right now. And this is only 2014, but you know, in footprint tall in Germany, in the 19th century they were doing a remote control trains. They were doing trains that would go onto the track track to an electrical signal. Stop, pick people up. I mean this stuff is actually pretty easy. okay. And but that's not, we're talking about a road though. It's not a track, but there the difference between that and a living system is those are fixed function algorithms that are doing edge tracing on the edge of a highway saying where's the right line and where's the yellow line?

Speaker 1:          01:51:11       And they're getting a gps signal and if you look at the code, it's not very big. You know, if it was a very big and complicated, it probably wouldn't work. So these google engineers have made something pretty elegant that has fuzzy logic and everything. They've got it to work. This has been tried since the 19 thirties with the radio control cars that had radios on the front and back control of distance and they've got it to work. But is this anything close to what life can do? The adaptability, but like, no, but, but neither was the initial combustion engine even close to what the saturn five rocket was like neither was the original model t in comparison to a tesla. And I mean doesn't that just stands to reason that constant innovation? I agree with you except that when I see really saifai things come in that are just because I'm an engineer, fundamentally when I see stuff that's like, oh my God, I can't even imagine how to get there because they're not even defining were what their term, right?

Speaker 1:          01:52:12       They're not defining their terms and no one's working on the project. So I'll give you one example of how hard this stuff is. So terrence and I would have these conversations about what he called novelty. You remember he used to say can crescents into novelty. So you know, terence left us in the year 2000. I saw the millennium. If you define it as the year 2000, but people say it really started in 2001. But I'm. Terrence was talking about all this stuff and I would say that's pretty obvious to myself. If things get novel, how do they get novel? And for years and years I worked on this project called the evolution grid. What we did was try to say let's simulate actual chemistry inside the computer and see if we can see novelty accreting and how does it do it. And in 2011, after running a year of simulations, partly at uc san diego and up in my barn, we believe that the whole surf all wired together, we found this staircasing formula that was a way that nature form structures in this case bonds form between these virtual molecules and doesn't break them.

Speaker 1:          01:53:24       They don't just all go back to mush. And it was this staircasing thing. I said, oh my god, you know, this took eight months of computation of find this method by which perhaps the universe accretes novelty and holds onto it. So I sort of did a virtual call, the parents and I said, we found the formula, I call it the cosmic wiggle, and he calls this stuff like the cosmic giggle. And if you remember from some talks, I said, we found the cosmic wiggle. But in the process of doing that, what I learned was holy shit, the basis for life, which is this massive, huge engine of stochastic probabilistic storm that's going on that literally ratchets and rocks. Everything from jujitsu matches to the jet. Air. Airplane is a powerful system. It's not at the basis of computing computing is this delicate little thing will take a number and we'll do a thing with it and we'll spread it out here, but nature's this massive machine.

Speaker 1:          01:54:26       So perhaps the future, and this is where we would come together is a merger between computing and natural systems. So this is a project that I'm calling the genesis engine project and it's having a computer control, trillions of chemical experiments all going at once and looking at them and selecting them and saying these are more powerful experiments and it can just search through molecular space. I just talked to a guy from google about this and he was like, oh, molecular search. We're interested in that. We're not just limited our searches to you know, the best bread recipes. No, we would like to search and molecule space and I talked to our neighbor and we have a place in New Jersey and he's like a head researcher at glaxo and he said this is incredibly valuable if you can, if you can actually use molecules to do the walking. run a trillion experiments at once and pick the best ones. And then run the trillion more experiments and walked through chemical space. We can figure out how to make a pharmaceutical in the least amount of steps you can simulate you create new materials and we'll have a hybrid digital and natural analog computer for the first time in this 21st century. But now you're really confusing me because now you've, you seem to think

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       that innovation is going to reach some new plateau if we do that. If we're able to hybridize, I think we're going to make the leaps that you are talking about. Joe, if we can do this hybrid, if we can harness pessimism line, what do you, what do you, uh, I'm an engineer so I know what it takes to build these things. And so I don't want to really oversell that by a certain date. We're going to have a singularity of some sort that certain dates. Stuff is always a goof it. Ray kurzweil wants to do it now with 20, 45 and the 20 slash 25 slash 45. They're being silly by doing that. And I think it's, it's, it, it does the whole idea of an exponential increase in technology. It does that whole idea disservice by like pretending than anybody. First of all, nobody's ever fucking predicted anything.

Speaker 2:          01:56:32       Right? Right. Nobody's ever nailed it. I mean, there's been some fascinating hg wells predictions that sorta came true, but no one said like on November 19th, 1972, there's going to be a telephone that does this. And instead what happened like that? December 21st 2012 drove me fucking crazy. It drove me fucking crazy because first of all it was intoxicating and then it was maddening and then it became ridiculous. And as the day rolled around it, I did an end of the world show you december 20, first 2012. But doug stan hope and joey diaz and my friends, honey, honey, this band. And we did the show. We did it live at the wiltern. It's not, it doesn't exist anywhere. It was just a, just a live show comedy show. Yeah. We just thought the asteroid was going to hit her. The mayans were to come back or the aliens are going to land or whatever the fuck was going to happen.

Speaker 2:          01:57:20       Nothing happened. Of course, down underneath grand central station in New York city with a friend of mine who's a. He's a kind of a psychedelic comic and he does. What's his name? What's his name again? What kind of a friend is this brain is fried. He's a wonderful guy, but we just. We laughed and then no one's gonna find them. 7 billion people in the building. People. we laughed our way through the day like you guys are doing it, the wheelchair and tell jokes and we said we gotta get less serious. This idea of picking a day so goofy. Like I had daniel pinchbeck on the podcast once and he was saying that it's definitely going to change the world to san diego. Do you know that? December 20, first 2012. Something's definitely not easy. It's absolutely, definitely gonna change where I was like, what are you talking about now?

Speaker 2:          01:58:06       What are you fucking. How can you say that? You can't say that. You can never say that. You can never say that date, but here's the show. Here's a real cool and for you, I have some of the last terence mckenna papers, you know, is archivist fire in 2007. What happened there? That was his lips in a rain forest. How the fuck did a fire destroyed after he died? The papers went to excellent. Were you just were on the big sur coast and they stored them in town office in berlin and a quiznos shop. Sub shop. I kid you not at some kind of electrical issue. Burned

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       a whole city block down and the eslan office and terrence papers

Speaker 3:          01:58:46       go, but didn't, didn't his place in Hawaii burn too?

Speaker 1:          01:58:50       No. No. It's still there. Oh, who owns that? You know, I don't know. I think it was sold recently. Jesus christ who bought that fucking thing. God damn. I would love to have that place. But in. so those are kinds of her lost. And as soon as that happened, I heard somebody called me and I called lorenzo. Lorenzo haggerty or dear friend. I love that dude. And I said, lorenzo, the ells have removed the incriminating evidence. Again. That's hilarious. we have to rebuild terence mckenna from extent materials, so it's like a grateful dead show thing. Send in your cassette.

Speaker 3:          01:59:26       Well, his, one of his most problematic theories was that novelty theory that the idea that december 20, first 2012 there was going to be some point of infant novelty and he thought it was going to be a time machine perhaps

Speaker 1:          01:59:38       based on the each and so I got a packet of papers in the mail that I came through, another archivist because I'm also handling timothy leary's, the remnants of timothy leary's library right now that are, you know, we're trying to scan the news archive and whatever, but this packet of material, 15 years of letters and there was a timewave zero edition, you know, in a little binder or whatever with terrence has a little writing on it. And there was a post it note that we're terrence's scribbled something. And then at the bottom he says December 21st. Yes, yes, yes. On the bottom of this post it note 1989. And so I scan that sucker in and put it online in december of $20. here is the nefarious posted note where terrance finally settled on this date, at least for terrence, you know, are they a wireless, uh, associate eric had been involved in this too in the course. But it says, it comes down to this posted note in. I wanted to put that up to sort of. So the absurdity of this is a guy that doesn't really know terrorists, wasn't a technologist and you know, he was a visionary thinker. We love him. I mean, he was an amazing dude. We love to listen to him, but I think you're right. I think he was off the rails on friday

Speaker 3:          02:00:53       too much into that one thing. And not only that, didn't he move the goalposts like at one point in time, it wasn't december 20. First it was like november or something and they changed it.

Speaker 1:          02:01:02       He changed it and he was trying to fit the data to the curve, but he wasn't really an expert in trends and history. And how can you match trends in history to anything. Anyway,

Speaker 3:          02:01:11       I would listen to him talk about that. This is the one thing that I had to shut off. I've listened to pretty much everything that he's ever done, all of the lorenzo archives, all the stuff that yana and put up way back in the day to

Speaker 1:          02:01:24       podcasts. Three 16 in the salon because that one we kind of take this thing apart and I've met with ralph abraham. We meet once A year kind of thing and then 2011 I was setting up to do a program called terrence 2012 about the life of terence mckenna. And I met with ralph and I said, tell me ralph, what was going on in the late nineties because you know, they're the trial or ralph rupert who was on your show, ralph abraham. And, and ralph said, we kind of were getting fed up because terrence was just spinning these stories and we didn't think they had any, any basis. And so at the 1998 trial logs, you know, the trials were, were they all met? And they talked to you there at uc santa cruz. He said, if you listen to that rupert, nice, set a trap for terrence.

Speaker 1:          02:02:11       We trapped him over and over again and we basically for an hour he was squirming and he was pretty up. Pretty uncomfortable slide. Pull out our cassette tape of that and we have digitized it and sure and behold, and you'll hear this within podcast 3:16 and what rupert says, it's terrence is talking about, you know, the internet will come to consciousness in 20 minutes or less, you know, it will be an ai that will no longer need us. And so rupert was ready for that and said, terrence, uh, I've heard reports of voice. You had him here and I've heard 10 versions of this story. And then the last version, it was an ai coming out of a time portal. No, because they're not going to let them get away with this. And terrence is such a good irish. Right? He's such Good on, you know, storytelling, storytelling, and he's good with. And he says, and that to 10. But at the end of that, it's very, very heartfelt and kind of terrence realizes his friends have kind of drawn a line in the sand. And the last thing he says in that trial august, well we want profits but we don't want false prophets. So, you know, I think the story was the thing at that time.

Speaker 3:          02:03:26       So do you think that he just got carried away with it? Like is it mean obviously he liked you and I like everyone we know is flawed as a person and he also, part of the reason why he was as visionary, sort of out of the box thinker, this guy who had this really incredible way of describing potential possibilities was that his mind was prone to going on these little weird journeys and took a lot of chances and maybe might have been married to a few of these chances that maybe shouldn't have

Speaker 1:          02:03:59       you have dennis. Dennis was in The introduction, I think, to the second version of invisible landscape. dennis is writing, you know, this is what we went through and we were in our twenties and we've learned something since then. We don't really know, I don't believe this anymore, and, and you know, I think it's almost like in this could happen to any of us. We get attached to a story. That's our shtick. It's our comedy act. It's our thing. We do our conspiracy theory. It's the thing that brings people into the seats, fills the theaters, and if it's paying your bills and it gives you self worth and whatnot, you can get really attached to that story. it's very unfortunate, you know, because

Speaker 3:          02:04:38       the rest of terrence's ideas were so fascinating. Compelling and listen to them talk about the positive benefits of psychedelics, what he thinks the potential of psychedelics hold and what he thinks about psychedelic culture. and there's so much fascinating. Absolutely fast.

Speaker 1:          02:04:55       I love the amount of him. He was terrence for me. I can tell you, and I only knew him the last couple of years. We didn't know he was on his way out. Frankly. You know, we did this whole fantastic thing with. We brought virtual worlds, sos house in Hawaii office, satellite dish, and he was placed into a world and he became his own ghost. The avatar was fantastic and I was looking forward to a long association with him and we were planning to an excellent workshop where he and I could do pieces of the same puzzle like I could do like the deep tech and weird ideas and stuff, but it was based on science and tech and some visionary thing and he would come in from his history side and elusive and all that stuff and we were going to go on the road and then he had a grand mal seizure two months later and it was horrific and we saw him last in september, [inaudible] 99 and it was like a good event that was held.

Speaker 3:          02:05:45       If he was around today, is there sufficient medical advances that would have helped him?

Speaker 1:          02:05:51       You know, a glioblastoma multiforme is, they're so rare and they have a really bad prognosis. I mean he had gamma knife surgery and I think it was november. I mean Eric Davis has last interview. The interview. Eric davis is wonderful from Hawaii right from, from, actually it might've been on the mainland. You hear a lot of dishes in the background. That wouldn't be the model for. He might've been an occidental during that one, after the surgery, but he's so beautifully cogent and coherent that mean he says he's a master. He's. He's so in his heart. He's so brilliant and you know, he's on all these antiseizure drugs and everything. One of the things he does say, which was this, he said, you need to rethink this thing because I'm an altered spaces because I'm on massive medications because I have a brain disease because, and there are people walking around that are certifiably in altered states and we shouldn't just privilege psychedelics. There are so many avenues into alternate realities is allowed us to see the world and I'm just experienced them and that's part of what my mission in the world is to say don't privilege these substances because then they become crutches. You can. Terrence used to say, you can't do this on the couch, you know, but I've since met a lot of people that are going to profound spaces through other means.

Speaker 3:          02:07:18       Yeah. I think he was a bit. I think he was a little hasty in his, his proclamation that this isn't capable, this is impossible under natural conditions because I have a friend who has had psychedelic experiences. He's not averse to it. He's a regular marijuana user. He's also

Speaker 2:          02:07:36       a kundalini expert and he's become a kundalini expert since I've known him. So over the lAst 10 years has been practicing. I've known him for about 10 years, has been practicing clue a very, very intensely over the past four or five and since then he says, he goes, I have deep dmt experiences doing kundalini and I have no reason to doubt him. I have another friend who does a different type of medication, some, some sort of a. It's not kundalini, but some sort of meditation and he also says that he's like, I have legit, full blown psychedelic experiences and I think I'm, I'm starting to research this and I'm actually going to be working on a book on this thing because I keep running into these people and I call it. And you know, we taught indogenous, so I'm using the term endo endo beings or endo voyaging or whatever.

Speaker 2:          02:08:28       Using your own endogenous ability, because I do it, I think it's just unbelievably difficult to do and I think some people are just lazy. I think that's really a part of it. It's also physical effort. There's a lot of people that are investing a tremendous amount of time and thinking calculation postulating, but the physical effort of meditation is beyond them and that's one of the things that mckenna talked about. Terrance talked about all the time how boring meditation was, so incredibly. Blood had a flash insight. Joe were to come back to the original theme that we're talking about. Why did the ancients could do this amazing stuff that we're now discovering? It's like currently high tech because they weren't distracted. What could they do? It's true. No internet, no twitter. You can check their faceBook every 10 minutEs. They could. A guy could look at a pile of rocks and see the full structure of the pyramid and it's in his head or her head with water flowers and they perhaps because they're not so distracted in a stimulus response, cortisol being shot in and interrupts and to do lists and whatnot, just massively distracted.

Speaker 2:          02:09:36       Those guys were using full power of this endogenous power and maybe a loose. this was unlocking net. It's also possible that they didn't have the predetermined limitations that we have when we consider like what normal states of consciousness exists. We have this idea of list exists and then if you want more than that, you got to take acid. If you want more than that, you've got to get on prozac. If you bought more than this, you know you have to be drunk. You have to be this, you have to be that. So we have these preconceived notions about altered states of consciousness, brilliant insight and, and, and we're so channeled and managed in a technologically are driving like driving here. I mean, we drove down the back of California from santa cruz ceremony, some of those beautiful landscaping. Amazing. Kayla and I are looking at this glowing light coming off the ocean, like what you saw at big sur. Those dudes, I mean we get a little snatch of it, but we don't have the full experience. We're not standing on the shore smelling the plants in a full body

Speaker 1:          02:10:34       of health being impacted by those photons coming, giving us an enlightened states because we're driving past it and we're watching our time and our gas levels and whatnot and we're out of tune. We're not present.

Speaker 3:          02:10:48       I've talked about this many times on the podcast. I had a really life changing experience. It had nothing to do with drugs and it was. I went to the big island. I went to the keck observatory. Wow. It just went because I was on vacation with my family there and we went to the. There's two levels to the observatories is the main observatory and then there's the visitors area and the visitors are just have a bunch of telescopes set out. It's pretty cool, but it's so high that it's above the clouds clouded area. Was it clear? Was it totaLly close, cloudy below us or was just fascinating. We were bummed out. We were like, oh man, we're going to hit clouds. we're not gonna see anything, but we actually drove through the clouds and because they have the diffused lighting all over the big island to protect the observatory from light pollution.

Speaker 3:          02:11:32       Man, the view was stunning. The milky way was so bright and clear and there's so many stars in the sky and it was a perfect night. I went back recently and I made a mistake and went back when it was a full moon and it was. It was actually a super moon. It was awful. I think august, august was the moon. It was still beautiful and amazing and still like, wow, that's a planet floating above us, but nothing like the first trip and that trip, being there and seeing those stars, you've got to think that is what early man saw every day. They were just awash in the mystery. That is the sky and they paid attention so much. They knew its shape, changes, wobble of the eaRth. They knew about the procession of the equinoxes. They had it mapped out, I mean there's so much that they had figured out that the equinox procession is, look what, 26,000 years somehow or another. These people had figured a lot of that out a long time ago

Speaker 1:          02:12:33       and it may have been just total presence and that they built the model in their head with their own dmt, if you'd call it that are endogenously or who knows. I'm sure they took drugs to. Here's a show that was a part of it as it was that as well. Here's another good one. Her friend andrew was commissioned. He's an incredible painter and he was commissioned to paint the caves of last scope, a co. Andrew johnstone, a complete reconstruction of an on like a surface. It was the same rock face, but it was for like a restaurant or something. Oh wow. And so he got all these, you know, different. You can't go in there. I guess it's people's breath will destroy it, but he started to paint this, this, you're going to really tune into this. He stArted to paint this inside this restaurant with the rock face and he was painting the copy of it and he would go out at night because he had to paint at night because the restaurant was in business and he would just know his break and whatever, and he started to study the sky and then we'd go back and paint more of the bowls, horns and the running, missing that, and he would go back and after all this time he started, wait a minute, I'm seeing lusko in the sky, but it's a little different.

Speaker 1:          02:13:42       And he would go back and look at, he was reconstructIng also go from the lowest detail and he said, this is a fricking star map. This is a star map. And he actually submitted a publication to an archeological journal, I don't know, was reviewed. Uh, you know, I don't know what happened. I think he wasn't reviewed well because I don't think that it's in the literature and I'm not seeing it now, chris, the stars are in a slightly different position, right? Let's constellations work, but you know, it doesn't, it's fucking powerful,

Speaker 3:          02:14:14       but isn't it one of those things we can kind of see patterns if you want to like go, oh, I see a bowl. I mean we have, there's some patterns like the big dipper, like, oh, it's big dipper, right? But when you see all the stars behind the changes, make up your own fucking patterns. You know, the big dipper represents to me is like an established pattern that you know exists. So you can call it the big dipper and say it's a dipper, but what it, what it is, is just, oh, that's that, that there they are there. If you know. Oh, I see a bull. Well, you're already fucking painting a bowl, dude. You know, of course you're seeing a bowl in the sky, right? Could be good. Plus you fucking stiff and pain all day. You're out of your head going outside, you're delusional. You're tired right now. Be a lot of things going on there. It wasn't reviewed very well. maybe not a blue wig and started writing a paper on it and everybody's okay. How much paint do you paint? Are you using? Right? How close are you to this pain? Then we get. We run into the mind of science. Yes, of course. It's and it's born to critique has to, right? It has to so much fuckery. You have to.

Speaker 1:          02:15:17       Because it's one of the only human enterprise. It is making progress.

Speaker 3:          02:15:21       Well, think about your friend that you were talking about that was in a fucking cult. The thought that aliens made the pyramids that led him to actual science. The science actually set him free from the cult. It did. It did. Indeed. Doesn't mean that's the whole reason why it has to question everything. It has to go. Okay, what did you see up there in the sky while you're sniffinG paint pal. That's right. You know, the cults can waste a lot of minds and a lot of lives then that's charismatic. Leaders are very dangerous, especially when they want to lead. And also I think that the intoxicating nature of being that leader.

Speaker 1:          02:15:56       What do you think of, you know the talk about sociopathy and psychopathy and that that's a certain percentage of the population is lacking a brain region that just doesn't have it. when they put the system together, that's there's no empathic part of the brain. Do you think, I'm asking you on on the air here, I mean this sounds like a eugenics kind of a thing, but do you think a future society or future earth ought to screen people when they're young kids when they're young to find out if their potential psychopaths and sociopaths and give them different

Speaker 2:          02:16:30       trainings and not allow them say to run armies and countries and stuff like that because they're just not going to have the empathic response. Like if you had poor vision, you shouldn't pilot an airliner, for example. It's a physiological thing that makes you kind of not suited for certain kinds of jobs. Can be proven that this is like there's an undeniable correlation between this particular area of the brain and lacking empathy in that you cannot be a good leader. You cannot be a good. There's so many factors like saying to someone can't be, if they lack empathy, they can't be a good leader, but what if those same factors that led them to lack empathy also lead them to lack a certain amount of ego that would kind of fuck up being a leadeR or law they laid, lacked a certain amount of need to be charismatic, right desire to have all these people follow you, like certain high functioning autistic folks have incredible skills in a lot of areas that maybe people that have extreme connections to emotions or to social interaction might not develop.

Speaker 2:          02:17:40       So I don't necessArily know that we understand. You just don't know all the potential possibilities when it comes to human interaction and messing with that. There's just a, there's this weird range of what is a person, right? And to say that, but there's also people that have taken those psychopath tests and you know, they will technically I'm supposed to be a psychopath. meanwhile, I'm a functioning rational, normal member of my community. I'm a loving father and husband and, and um, everything's great. So what the fuck, like why does this test say I'm a psycho, right? I don't know. I don't know if we haven't nailed yet. The problem comes when we get psychopaths doing really terrible shit like dictators and stuff like that and we can't get rid of them. Then the damage isn't being done and we can't do any. And what makes them a psychopath in the first place.

Speaker 2:          02:18:29       Like a perfect example is saddam hussein's children who were notoriously evil, uday and qusay, where names were two of the most horrific human beings that we've ever seen come out of the, the, the, you know, the brute of a diCtator. I mean he, he developed some unbelievably evil children. Now, why is it that they were evil? Is it the environment? Is a nurture? Is it nature? Is it genetics? Is it epigenetics? Like what is it that. Is it just being unbelievably spoiled? Because you have ultimate power from the time you were a child and you're essentially royalty. What is it? What causes that? It's possible that our survival as a species is going to come down to how well we unhealthily we manager our children. I mean ultimately if we're. If we're not doing that, then like if for instance you were building a mars colony, was going to have 250 people in it and they're going to have children or whatever. You

Speaker 1:          02:19:28       would know that if you get one kind of crazy revolutionary leader that does the whole charismatic thing and whatever, and then there's a shooting thing is going to shoot a hole so the dome and everyone's going to die. So you can't ever afford that. So you have this careful management of human psychology within that call on you to make sure it's healthy and watch those processes and it. To some extent the scandinavians did this a thousand years ago. The scandinavians have the vikings. when they had their war parties, the leader of the war party, they would go and invade east anglia or all the way to greenland, labrador and what they called these guys the preserve or kinks, and these guys were put in charge and then they would go and they will do terrible shit. I mean they would terrorize and murder and whatnot, but when they settled east anglia, when they built york, york, right, they excavated it. Well, the vikings are now settled, so they took the. The worker king. Thank you very much. You've done your job. You get the nice little grass hut at the edge of town and you're off duty because we can't afford that. Now we have to build a community.

Speaker 3:          02:20:35       So what will they do with him? You did retire them off. Retired to mob and how you keep them from killing people. I'm going nutty.

Speaker 1:          02:20:40       He just. Nobody would follow him as the rules. It was the. It was the way that they did it. So when you look at how sane scandinavia is today, maybe they got all that out.

Speaker 3:          02:20:50       That's a funny. That's a very funny thought. That who knows, who knows, who knows. I think it's also there is a potential for technology to play a part in all this. I think that one of the things that's coming out with technology is access to information and access to information. Not just current information, but I'll maybe even future like the ability to read minds, to read thoughts to read, look, fff, mri, [inaudible], although it's been widely criticized, has been used to convict people of crimes in India. There's a woman who was convicted of murder because she had what they describe as functional knowledge of a crime scene and this has been widely discredited and it's very controversial. I don't know. I don't know the whole story, but it was for a television show that I was doing for saifai. We interviewed a neurologist or a neuroscientist and she was describing how this in in our country will never work, but in these other countries where the maybe they don't have as much of as much of an understanding or they were able to manipulate their courts into thinking that this was far more definitive and conclusive than it really is.

Speaker 3:          02:22:07       But the point being that this is just the tip of the iceberg, right? And if they continue to get better at this, and if this human technological symbiotic relationship takes place to the point where we essentially are our memories, especially there pretty piss poor, but if we can turn our memories into some digital archive that you can access, it will. Then we're going to know I've got an I'm going to look into your head and I'm going to know what's going on and to be able to tap into it and we will. We'll be connected the same way we were connected with wifi the same way our cell phones are connected through the cellular network. They'll be some sort of a network of information exchange between all people. And if that's the case, deception will be almost impossible. Motivations would be crystal clear and you're going to know who's full of shit. That's going to be a fucking bad day for a lot of idiots out there because a lot of assholes out there that have been leading along idiots and the they, they believe in these people. You know, whether these cult members or whatever

Speaker 1:          02:23:07       you remember in kubrick's film, 2001 in the beginning when there's the pre, the monkeys, the monkeys model and they're sitting at dawn and they're sitting in this kind of cliff area and they're looking at each other, right? They're looking at each other. I never forgot that scene because it's the scene before they get attacked by that other group that comes in, but they're looking at each other and their nonverbal. RighT. They're not communicating. They don't have to do lists and emails and shit going on. They're just there. And to me like kubrick was trying to show that they are in a group intelligence that just by eye gaze they could tell what the state is and then the share that state. Because if somebody in such an intense environment, I mean if you have nefarious purposes or you know you're going to look away and you're going to have that whole thing. so maybe that's the way we were before we came into mind. Before all this stuff came in civilization mind to do lists, hierarchies and whatnot. We were. There was no way for us like we're way we're looking now at each other. We're really connected.

Speaker 3:          02:24:13       Maybe the valleys of perceptions may be the pre communicative apes where they didn't have verbal communication or language or anything. Maybe they had this sort of intuitive sense of each other and then that was all lost with email and twitter and ended up coming back with some new technology that takes it to a far deeper level. And

Speaker 1:          02:24:34       what I think, and this is my theory, is that a louis. Yeah, we were warning, you know, it looses by packing those thousand initiates and two that buried temple and subjecting them to sound and music and you know, some kind of sounds like a rave. It was like intense, but these people were fashioned. they were fat. They were fashioned into new beings from in that experience wasn't, couldn't it have been a group mind fast and couldn't have been, you know, returning that. And when we siT in medicine circles today, when we do jujitsu, when we do a group yoga, intense things are intense ordeal. Things that people are seeking out now for deep connection to remove isolation from other people. Meditation's all these practices are this yearning to get back to where we were, you know, you didn't feel isolated from others and that we had her in a group mind and that that's the future of evolution of our communities and we may need the shaman to come around, you know, in the upper paleolithic, you know, those communities were pretty helpful.

Speaker 1:          02:25:41       That waS a pretty functional world. I mean, you know, coming into, you know, the karnak and the stone hands and the lay lines and be incredible world of even celtic europe was incredibly together. There was killed at europe is like the european union now. Celtic europe had medical practices and common laws and the druids could come in if there was a battle about to occur between celtic people's. The druids had the power to walk down that line and decide whether the battle should happen or not because there was an authority. There was. So this whole idea of the civilization of the european union after 2000 years of roman interest to seen war, barbarian warfare, christian religious and whatnot, as they've returned to the celtic model, they've returned in sense the upper paleolithic model of civilization of of civil societies and not beating each other in and in doing and of common currency, common exchange, common health comm. So maybe that is coming back that is returning and we're, we're shutting off the culture that came and destroyed illusion looses.

Speaker 3:          02:26:48       Well, I think there's definitely a feeling amongst a lot of folks that the standard model, the cubicle life retirement at 65 is not just unappealing, not just unrewarding, it's surf, surf model slavery. It's a form of slavery that's voluntary mean you, you're, you're, you're connecting to a machine. You're giving your body literally. You're giving your health, you're giving your spinal fluid, ears, soul. Your creative creativity are very. Your body literally is like giving into your chair and your back is being compressed and your discs are bulging. Your feet are going numb, and I mean your, your body is being sucked down into this. Your mind is turned into a stimulus response pieces of jello and I think that's what a lot of this yoga, this, this renaissance of meditation that a lot of people are experiencing, especially yoga. Yoga was never this popular when I was right.

Speaker 3:          02:27:44       it's incredibly popular now and as the rise of technological connection, electronic connections with each other has also facilitated the rise of like and you know, fit these people wanting to do things that are physical, physical. I. On friday I did a pretty long float and we go. By the way they've offered you a free float if you come up to the santa cruz mountains are friends. that sounds like a long trip for a float. I got one in my basement. This is a beautiful flotation. It's the name of the company. Cloud nine. Oh, okay. I've heard of them. Yeah, because jim shaunti and they was fascinating

Speaker 1:          02:28:22       property and I went there for a float and I tell you, you know, it's, it's incredible because it's, it's like doing, you know, a psychedelic in that or doing deep meditation or doing. But the flotation tank is I think better because I process all my brain shit, like for the first hour or something in this probably happens to you. It just grind through and it's like I'm having these repeated thoughts of my mind or my ego is grinding through and through and finally it quiets fine when it's quiet and I don't have stimulus on my body because I'm in a flotation tank and I maybe have my head held up or whatever and I start not knowing my body where it is and I'm free, I'm liberated, and then the I can do the deep work at my god. I mean the next day, this is why I was able to finish this to scientific papers because I floated and I lost all that 2000 years of refer me. It was months and months of being in my head. I mean, I, I. It's such a powerful, powerful

Speaker 3:          02:29:25       tool. It's an amazing tool and it's really bizarre to me that this was something that was kind of forgotten for a long time. I didn't understand when I first discovered the tank when I first saw it in altered states when I was in high school. That, uh, amazing movie with William Murray where he turns into drink. Iowasca became some freak animal. Crazy movie really does not hold up. Don't watch it again. We'll try to watch in 2004. It's a piece of shit. Oh, it's so bad. It's so bad. Like people have watched. It laughed at me like, you fucking like this movie. My brow is 14. Okay. So long time ago. but point is I didn't experience it until 2002. And when I first did it, others plays in burbank called soothing solutions. I was placed. Where did it. The first time I did I wanted to do it forever and I found a place that had it and I was like, how is this not popular?

Speaker 3:          02:30:18       And then when I started talking about it, everybody's like, wow, you're always talking about this thing. Like you're the guy who talks about the tank. I'm like, how are you hearing about this from a goddamn comedian? Like, how is this not the. How's the president not on television and saying we need to create a more introspective commerce society and one of the things we're going to do is we're going to wheel out isolation tanks all over the nation. There will be a beautiful thing to bring them up to some high schools, community centers, universities. This will accelerate thinking. It's one of the best tools for personal evolution I've ever experienced for actually the exact same thing as you said. For me it's the first x amount of minutes is all just going over my own bullshit, but slowly but surely because I do it so often I've gotten quicker with that and it's gotten down to like 20 minutes, but it's just I get in there and I go, here we go. I've got to go through all this stupid shit. Clean all this out. But perspective enhancing like, you know, like no matter how hectic and weird my life is when I get into that thing and then I get out, I'm like, that's all right.

Speaker 1:          02:31:20       Yeah. You're like, I'm the best hippie of the 66. It's beautiful.

Speaker 3:          02:31:26       It's so important for me because I'm always juggling like five different jobs. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:31:29       a million things to. And you know, my back, I put my fricking back out so I go into float and it's like the first hour it's just so painful. It's like slowly like separates and it's like I barely do this and then barely put my. Put my hands down and then then I say, wait a minute, my body can take any position so I let my body tickets own position. It moves itself around until I'm not in pain anymore. And then by the time I got out the pain was down like 80 percent. Yeah. it's, it is an unbelievable tool and it's just weird to me how uncommon it is as terrence's. How do they keep the lid on this stuff? Don't.

Speaker 3:          02:32:14       The other thing that terrence says, the man, sometimes people do the man's work for the man, like no one's putting, keeping the lid on isolation tanks. It's just no one tAlked about it for whatever reason. It's just life is tough. People have mortgages, they have student loans. There's a lot of work that has to be done. The lawn has to be mowed. Got to raise your kids a lot of shit going on. It's hard to servitude jail. We were talking before the podcast about chairs. It's weird chair that I have this saddle chair. Do you use an ergonomic chair when you, uh, when you do your writing,

Speaker 1:          02:32:48       you know, I, my neighbor and I made this chair. We took this body built chair from. There's a plug for you from Texas that's used by surgeons, by brain surgeons. It tilts forward. It has incredible support and we made an extension arm that holds the keyboard of my lap and the mouse exactly in the right place just right where your arms hang, hang, and then I can roll back from the screens. I'm much farther from the screen so I don't get that myopic kind of early visit and vision loss. That's me. I got that chair. Yeah. So I've been using that chair for 20 years, but now what I'm finding unfortunately, just even reaching for the mouse as creating repetitive strain injury for me, even going to get one of them helmets or move around your eyes. Unfortunately I'm back on a laptop where I don't have to do any motion until my friend told me.

Speaker 1:          02:33:38       He said, you're an idiot. You know, I have a friends of the hassle. You know, right away you're an idiot. I'm an idiot. He's an asshole. But I have my own podcast called the levity zone. And I do lots of editing. You know, I know that you could just go straight out, but I'm like a craftsman. I, we have different musicians in each episode for the levity, sound liberties on.org. Um, say that again. Levity zone.org. [inaudible] dot org. It's the world needs more. We have plenty of novelty. We need more at t l e v I t y zone. So you're in the zone when you're listening to these shows at [inaudible] dot org. And so I do tons of editing and he said, you fool, you need to get a kensington track ball so you're just moving your thumb, not your arm. All editors are using track balls for buttons.

Speaker 1:          02:34:25       And I finally got religion and I'm finally not using a mouse. Mac has a, uh, they have like a key, like this track pad. Yeah. It's a larger version of it. That's what I use. It's amazing. I used to move the tracks back and forward and then I use the other hand on the kensington to go cut, paste, cut, paste. Okay. You're doing great. Yeah, totally. Great. Yeah. Well you also have probably have keystrokes preprogrammed on that thing and the buttons. Yeah. That helps cut. Copy paste. Mark's like no collected. I love the track pad. Once I switched to it on a, um, on a home computer or on an imac, I would never go back to the house except for gaming. But I can't it either way. The digi barn museum, we got a new artifact. Doug angle parts mouse, you know doug engelbart, he and building that.

Speaker 1:          02:35:14       She created the mouse and the first online system in the mid sixties and they dug, had something called the mother of all demos which happened on December 9th, 19, 68 and it totally revolutionized what computing was going to be. He was like in this hall in san francisco using a mouse and the cursor was going on the screen is opening windows and clicking the first graphic user interface with 68 house and I don't have that one, but I've got a. If you look up mother of all demos, you'll see the one that came into the dog barn looks exactly like the one that doug is using the demo now. There were several of them made so we don't know, but this has the round buttons as a great big case on it and a key set. So the see he had. He didn't have to go to the keyboard.

Speaker 1:          02:36:03       He had this, this court keyboard. I'll that. Yeah, there, there, there, there are three buttons mean well, apple had one button actually that deep into the two thousands probably from my collection, but that's an alto mouse from the seventies. If look at sandy's, yeah, do tug to mother of all demos and you'll probably find the, uh, the video of it. Is it true that xerox created the user interface in the apple copied xerox and then ultimately microsoft copies apple? It wAs, it was kind of passed from one to the other. So for example, uh, a say sri stanford research institute did this, doug engelbart nls, fantastic demo and everybody watched it and go, oh my god, this totally changed computing into a human thing rather than data processing and batch. And you know, it became no, it's visual. We're visual. This is a tool for our minds. It's a tool for this. This is it. An hour and a half long though. So yeah, scroll around and you can see doug, you can see doug other areas. wow. You see that thing on the right? See that in 68, 68. So look at that. That looks exactly like the mouse. It's at the barn right now.

Speaker 2:          02:37:16       That's remarkably similar to what a lot of people use.

Speaker 1:          02:37:19       Then look at the keyboard and I think steelcase or somebody did that thing and the key set allows you to court key movements like accelerated things and then on screen he has clickable text. He's got a video window that a guy appears from sri transmitted live video. Look at this. Look at this. That's him. Yeah. That's one of the engineers at sri.

Speaker 2:          02:37:43       So he's got live video on a screen. Yeah, this is 68 and 68. He is live video.

Speaker 1:          02:37:51       Yeah, and this is beamed in a big auditorium in san francisco at a conference and everybody in the audience is going, oh my god, this is computing. This is, this is interacting with people and so he's clicking see the cursor. You can just sort of barely see it. He's moving around, he's clicking on things, they're pulling up data, they're doing searches and that's a recipe lists and so everybody looked at this and said, oh my god. And so xerox palo alto research center kind of had a bunch of people from doug's group and then they built the first network, personal computer or the ether net and all that stuff. In the seventies, and you're right, you know, in walks steve jobs and in the croup and they kind of went, oh my god, that's the future of computing, and they created the lisa and the macintosh and bill gates and the company looked at the xerox star and altona and gerald pneumonia who was at park, came to microsoft and created microsoft word based on him creating the first word processor at park and then made a billion dollars. Right. And everything. But no, I mean xerox really did invent the future under bob taylor's leadership in the seventies. They just created the future. Right.

Speaker 2:          02:38:57       How did they drop the ball and go to copy machines? Well, you know, it was such a company full of copier heads and understand what they were looking at it and walked out the door, But dolby came out of that and everybody in ibm in the 19, whatever it was, when they said no one's gonna want a computer in their house. Yeah, the fuck up. It was like the biggest bad call ever. Right? I mean, there were all these predictions that completely ridiculous. Ridiculous. In retrospect, in retrospect, how could anybody. No, that's. Isn't that always the point? Is that like, like we were talking about, you can't predict a 2012 or 20, 45, you're just not going to not going. No one's gonna see it. I am going to have some ideas, but the ultimately the thing itself, like no one ever thought the internet was going to be facebook or message boards or you know, twitter, social media interaction. The way we we experienced today. It's so unbelievably bizarre. this connection that we have to each other. It's so intense and, and, and no one saw it coming. Like for instance,

Speaker 1:          02:40:05       just yesterday morning I got up into holy shit, I'm going to be on joe rogan. I'm going to just at least post your beautiful red face logo, my facebook page and put it on a bunch of groups because available on a mug. So I just put this up. I put this up just on facebook. I only got three or 4,000 followers, but this thing just went bing, bing, bing, bing, bang. And people, you know, there's probably a ton of listeners that there wouldn't have been just because of one little thing.

Speaker 3:          02:40:31       Yeah, I'm sure. I'm sure. Well, it's one of those things too that I love the fact that someone could listen to this and go, hey, you know, bruce damer is on this podcast. you got to check this out, here's a link. And then boom, boom, boom. And then someone retweets it and it gets retweeted a thousand times and sent to facebook and someone sends in an email and

Speaker 1:          02:40:56       it's like, we're back. We're back in that little group of 2000, one eight, looking at each other. But what we're looking, we're spending for sending the whole of our culture and technology in each gaze. It's amazing. I mean, if you could be some kind of super being unwatched the mind of humanity from orbit and study it as a thing that's coming alive and it's moving. It's getting connected, uh, maynard to be better than any trip experience. I mean, just in truth, you know, I look up at the night sky or doing the work in origin of life. I'm looking at molecular streams and looking through microscopes on liquid chemistry and I was like this most amazing universe of just lipids moving around on a slide and then look at the internet. This is the greatest time in the history of and, and you know, the people talk about rare earths, you know, how rare is, are we, you know, the drake equation, which shows solar systems that have planets in the planet that have been the right habitable zone and the develop intelligent life. And we had just the right end asteroid impacts to come in and spin the disk and say, start again. Do it again. And, and we rose. I mean, what's the chance of us snus being out there? How many of them are there?

Speaker 3:          02:42:17       Well, isn't the ultimate mind fuck the concept of infinity? Because the way I've heard it described that if infinity exists and they believe it does, that means the universe is so huge that everything that's ever happened on earth in the exact same order, it's happened in infant number of times somewhere else.

Speaker 1:          02:42:34       Well, I had, I once had a kind of a conversation with the universe and I asked it, so I went through a thought experiment where I went through the origin of life, you know, I just loaded my mind with everything I could do and I went through and saw it. I was like super charged on all this stuff of my meditation and my thought experiments and I came out screaming, you know, I came into the division of the first proto cell and while it was happening, I looked around and I saw all this crazy molecular stuff going on, which gave me the vision to work backwards to create the model that we're just publishing now. But I felt, and this is kind of heretical, but I, I couldn't see that it was all mechanical, you know, it seemed like there was something doing it. I mean, it was so complex.

Speaker 1:          02:43:25       So in this thought experiment, I, I sat up straight and I said, I want to ask one more question if this, if there's something before life. There were, if there was intelligence in the, did this, can I see it? you know, this is, I think when you asked the ineffable these questions ineffable, just get pissed off with questions sometimes and the inevitable, what it did in my consciousness as I was looking out into the night sky into the darkness and it resolved and to starfield and they'll start fill the rural salt into gas clouds and galaxies, and then the whole thing came rushing into, slammed into my consciousness sensor and knocked me down and what the answer was you silly monkey. The universe is big enough to have agency. It grew big enough from the big bang. It grew along the probability streams so that this happened.

Speaker 1:          02:44:20       That's the answer. There's one concept that I. I can kinda understand infinity. I can kind of understand a lot of the concepts of the cosmos, but the big bang, which is I hear it, it goes in one ear and it goes out the other and it's just some words. It's just some shit that's typed out. It's just an idea that someone has that I can't conceptualize. It doesn't. my brain is too fucking dumb. It just doesn't process it. I, I got a vision of it because it's, it's hard for me to, I mean the vision that I got, I was sitting there in bed asking the question of what can I see pack, so I wanted to see back and what came in my head were three buckets and inside the three buckets were three blobs and eat. one of the blobs is super low probability of ever happening.

Speaker 1:          02:45:17       The probability buckets and the others are kind of like ordinary rowboats. And then there's a thIrd bucket. Second bucket has a super low probably blob, and then the third bucket has the low probably blog and the, the intelligence that was communicating to me to teach me said, watch me bing, bing, bing. So when you say this though, I'm sorry to interrupt you. So the, the, what the intelligence showed me because I was asking the question and getting a thought experiment back was saying I can trigger the lowest probability of hanse one after the other after the other. And I said, whoa, okay. And said, watch me. I will rotate them towards you. So the buckets are all lined up and you say you see the path through the low probability events. I say, yes I do. He says watch this. And the path went all the way back to cosmo.

Speaker 1:          02:46:04       Genesys and I went, oh my god, you know, this energy was pouring through super low probability and then the entity said watch this. And I was pulled back and I saw trillions of these tracers coming from, from the singularity, from the big bang. And the answer was that is the power, the power to trigger the lowest probability events in all directions. And that is the power, you know, away from mundane it please. So you're saying that you know, you're communicating with an entity and you're saying, you know, this thing that's communicating with you, this is more likely your imagination. No. Well sometimes it is imagination on steroids sometimes to stuff comes in. It's like your friend you were talking about stuff comes in. I don't know where from, you know einstein for example, used to do this. Einstein will be having his coffee and his swiss cafe pondering about can can light go faster, you know, is there a constant and the speed of light and one night he just sort of sat down, closed his eyes and suddenly he was in this endogenous world and you can read about this.

Speaker 1:          02:47:14       He called it good duncan experiments, thought experiments. He would say, I'm going to try to understand this, but he would open himself to anything and what came into einstein's mind was he became like a train. He was like mounted onto a train and there was another train coming down the track and they each had so it was at night and the light was streaming out and he said, but how can I be the photon going toward that? Other photon in the photons are going twice the speed of light relative to each other and then he had this credible insights about, no, it's possible if you have different frames of reference, it's possible. His face change in all the whole special on general theory of relativity came out from these thought experiments that he did that he didn't quite know where they came from. They just sort of poured into him.

Speaker 1:          02:48:02       Then he had to interpret and into mathematics and into testable theories. Well, when we're. do any ideas come from though really? when, where, why? Why consider the possibility that coming from entities? why don't why? I just think this is your mind, your imagination. Just contemplating possibilities and, and here's where I think, oh, this is a really big woo model because this wound, wu on the front of the stove, the t shirt here. I think that somehow our minds when we're open and we're, we're in a state of not distraction or boundaries or dissolved and we're in a clear state that our minds are big enough computational engines to resonate with a whole lot of shit non locally. So for example, you believe nonlocal intelligence. You think that like perhaps there's some sort of a universal intelligence out there that you can tune into. I think that in some way, like for example, if you trace all of the neuronal pathways down, all the synapses and across all the caps, backwards and forwards in your mind, and you can look this up online, the number of those tracers, those unique strings is larger, you know, or an equivalent or larger than the number of subatomic particles in the universe.

Speaker 1:          02:49:17       Now, all accountable objects in the universe. It's this huge. The common materials are huge because the brain says this network and as soon as it ramps up, so your brain, if you. It's like an informational system, a coding system that, uh, if you could activate this pathway and that little variation of that pathway and that will, is actually bigger than the universe. And of course it's in the universe to, it's not bigger than itself. But then you have the idea of non locality where everything talks to everything non locally, you know, and instantly was this bell's theorem and all this sorts of things. And so could it be that there's some, and this is a total who hand wavy thing. It could it be that your mind really fully activated, really fully present through your filters, through your training, whether you're a roman catholic or you're a skeptical, whatever you stuff can come in that's resonating from some field, another intelligence objects, patterns, stuff in time and history beyond what our little reductionist kind of mechanical thinking gives us that could we be resonating with real shit that's out there, that's beyond what our training is, but it will be filtered throughout training.

Speaker 3:          02:50:37       You're sort of tapping into some incredible, ultimate potential, some potential for accessing information and, and possibilities for, for possibilities as far as connections possibilities, as far as like putting things together in your head and proposing the various scenarios that maybe wouldn't be available. If you impose limitations on where they came from,

Speaker 1:          02:51:00       you try to figure out with your training in your to do list and your algorithms, you'd never get there. So you're literally have to blow your mind completely open. You know, uh, uh, uh, graham hancock gave a fantastic example on your show within the last month, which was a telescope. Remember that needs to shape change the shape of the lands in order for you to resolve and see stars and galaxies. Right? So those people who never use telescopes say, well, you shouldn't have to perturb the mind to see what's out there. Well, they've never looked through a telescope, right? So we should, as a species, we realize we need to perturb our.

Speaker 3:          02:51:40       Mine's always have a huge problem with people that say you shouldn't perturb the mind because I don't see the negative impact of perturbing the mind and I see a massive amount of positive and then I see these people saying you shouldn't perturb the mind and they haven't perturbed them on something like, well, what are you talking about? Like anyone who says that like psychedelic experiences are not valuable and hasn't had psychedelic experiences. I'm like, okay, we're just going around in circles here. We're talking crazy. Like you don't know whether they're valued and you're just totally.

Speaker 2:          02:52:06       They've never floated or they've never done meditation. But the what I think the beauty of psychedelic experience, the actual taking of a psychedelic is, is that it's undeniable mushrooms work on everybody. Dmt works well. Some people, some weird freak people apparently don't have dmt experiences. I don't know. The problem is it's so illegal and it's so. It's so difficult to to. I don't think strassman had any people that didn't find a an impact for the intravenous dmt studies that he did at university of New Mexico, but I think that people that say it's not valuable and haven't experienced it, you're discounting it just thousands, millions, perhaps people who have had incredibly valuable experiences doing it and you're saying you don't need it. Like you know, you're scared. You're scared. All these tribal cultures and that needed that use that to initiate people into humanity, to human being.

Speaker 2:          02:53:04       I think from then then your idea of endogenous access becomes becomes very attractive and it also becomes more plausible because people know that these states are reachable because I think without knowing, like I remember the first time I had any psychedelic experience, the first really big one was a five men. Oh, I had a small mushroom experience, but the five meo dmt experience. Like after that I can remember really clearly thinkinG, well, now that I know that this is a possibility, I have to kind of rethink, rethink my spectrum, everything, and so then one could see reaching these incredible states through some sort of indogenous method that maybe perhaps he would have never even given it the chance before and I think you know, you're looking african communities that used ibogaine as an initiatory experience on ordeal or initiate or experience. they're trying to take those uninformed youths that think they know everything right, and they're and they're exposing them to something so massive that forces them to challenge their own internal state and and come to terms with fears or other things and broaden themselves out there.

Speaker 2:          02:54:20       We even there weft as a human beIng. When they come out of that, they're a member of the community and they're trustable and they look each other in the eye and they had the taps. They're not children name or not juvenile anymore, and this is perhaps it was stolen from us when we lost our initiatory rights and was taken away by priests. It was taken away by corporations or, or maybe it's just a blip. I mean maybe it's not taken away. Maybe it's just in our context of our lives. We'd look at a thousand years being so long, but in the universe said nothing. Nothing. And if this state, this the look to the life of the earth, it's enough and then nothing. so we're like, it's been taken away from us. Like now we're talking about it. It's not going anywhere. We're. Yeah, we're, we're, we're celebrating its return.

Speaker 2:          02:55:06       Listen, we're out of time, but this is an amazing conversation. We could have 100 of these. I think we really could. We could, we could go. We could take the what if train to the end of mars and back and I would like to come back and bring you a bunch of artifacts like that original miles that you can, you can play with on the show here.
