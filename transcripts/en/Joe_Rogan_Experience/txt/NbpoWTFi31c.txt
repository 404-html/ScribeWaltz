Speaker 1:          00:00          Joe rogan experience Joe Rogan podcast. My name's Jane Goodall. At least 100% I found that fascinating. And um, the, the reason being is that there's an actual animal represents called gigantic and it would say that's more than eight feet tall that lived in the most recently we know of a hundred thousand years ago. So that's not outside the realm of possibility. If you look at what we've learned today about things that we thought were extinct, whether it's, you know, the Goblin shark or whatever it's been looking at, or maybe four point there because it's still within the realm of an ape like thing. Yeah. Which is different from the other cryptos all logical folks who say they were dragging. You get life forms that have no counterpart. Yes. Anywhere else. It's a real animal. I mean, they have home stay out of the fossils. They know that it's real animal. They actually found their teeth in the apothecary shop and like a public area in like the 1920s gigantic quite make to that, that they couldn't understand.

Speaker 1:          01:21          They were like, what the fuck is this? They knew it was probably, we knew it was enormous. So it eventually led to a digs in China where they found these gigantic pivots buried their dead. Really fascinating stuff. So that that's a high level of intelligence and respect for their dead. You know, it's really interesting stuff. And the um, the Pacific northwest is a crazy spot and it's exactly where they would come if it came down the Bering strait with humans. It's really interesting stuff because we know they existed with humans. We know it was a real animal coexistence. Yeah. Would they unquestionably side by side in Asia a hundred thousand years ago, at least. That's, that's solid. So it's, that's a blip a hundred thousand years. Especially when you look at like the Pacific northwest and how dense it is. Well, she's saying, she's saying that it existed at some point, but she's not agreeing.

Speaker 1:          02:17          You're still, but randomly, actually this is still there. She thinks enough people have seen the same thing when they brought there. First of all, they have gray hair like silver, the big old six foot tall gray hair. They have photos of dead ones, couple hundred shot, no question. It's a totally, believe it or not, this is more people go through at least this particular where they found these gems, they have a video of one. So there's an interesting fundamental fact. Okay, I'm gonna make up a story. There exist a creature that is large and each every human who has come up too, right? Yeah. Well, how do you know what I said about big foot is that a big foot is due right next to the grill is no one gives a shit. And if, uh, if God didn't exist, it would be mythological and animal that is smart as a human, maybe without three before cortex 40% larger than a person sees people to fall in the ocean and kill sharks.

Speaker 1:          03:45          Kills sharps. Big Four. Can't kill a fucking sharp know. Think about the shit that killer whales. Nothing pops of the killer whale except for people because that sentence, big can't kill. I like these assertions, knows the shots from the jacket. It's not going to be split tasks. Your arguments they have in comic con, you know, or Kevin Smith through. They have a whole four hour podcasts. Look when big word, a Sasquatch or big foot or a sharp, yeah, it's the idea of the animals. It's just like we were talking about earlier, the idea that we're, that we're actually picking shit. Brilliant things that nobody else does. Scotland. Let's say I called it, I told Ya
