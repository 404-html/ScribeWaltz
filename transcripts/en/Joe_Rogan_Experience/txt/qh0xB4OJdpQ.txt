Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Good googly Mowgli. Hello everybody. Welcome back. This episode of the Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by tank. Ting is one of my favorite sponsors on the podcast because I have heard nothing but positive responses from people that have used ting and have saved money. It's a no bullshit and mobile service and what they mean by no bullshit is they have no contracts, no early termination fees, no ridiculous bundling or ride along services, the way they set up their rates. You use what you use and you pay for what you use. No overage charges, no penalties, no add on charges, no mysterious line items on your bill. They decided to put together a mobile service the way mobile really should have been done from the beginning with no nonsense and good service. They use this sprint backbone, so you have a major provider that's providing your bandwidth, providing your, your cell phone service, and you can get the top end android devices.

Speaker 1:          00:01:04       When you buy a device from Ting, if you go to Tim's website, if you go to [inaudible] dot [inaudible] dot com, you can actually save $25 off one of these android devices, but if you see the range of devices that they have, they have all the cool new gadgets like the Samsung galaxy s three, the Samsung Galaxy s four actually is the new one, the Samsung Galaxy note three, which is what I have. The htc one. I mean they have all the really cool, interesting new android phones, so you get the high end phones, you get sprint service. It's exactly the same as sprint. It's not some weird mom and pop company that's giving you some rinky dink cell phone service and you can do it and save money and do it in a way where you don't feel gross at the end of the month like that. Got Me. These fucking creeps to kindle team will also give you credit for $25 of your early termination fee up to $75 per device.

Speaker 1:          00:02:03       Twenty five percent rather. I'll say that again. Tim will give you. It's. They call it their early termination fee relief program, which is kind of sweet. They will give you credit for 25 percent of your early termination fee up to $75 per device. So if you're getting fucked by your other company when you leave and go to tank, they'll try to give you a little bit of relief. It's a really cool way to get your mobile service. It's really cool way that they've decided to provide mobile service. Just no nonsense. And it's ethical. It's clean, it's a better way to do it. Um, we have friends that use it and it's been nothing but positive. We've had nothing but excellent responses. So go to [inaudible] dot ting.com. Saved money and better manage your mobile service using ting. So that's Rogan.ting.com. And save some money. Well you were also brought to you by [inaudible] dot com.

Speaker 1:          00:02:59       That's o n n I t and very excited that we have Dr Rhonda Patrick on the podcast today because she can explain some of the shit that's on it. That confuses me. All the baffling stuff about what, what antioxidants are necessary. What about, what about digestive enzymes, when did they come into play? All these things are very, very crucial for health and very confusing, so we're going to get to that today, but on it.com carries, we essentially try to carry everything that we find beneficial and everything that I use. Everything that arbor uses, everything that our friends use, athletes, mixed martial arts fighters, Jujitsu people, things that things that would benefit your physical conditioning, things that would benefit your cognitive function, things that benefit your immune system, your endurance, what we sell, whether it's our strength and conditioning equipment like kettlebells, battle ropes, steel, maces, those things along those lines, or whether it's the nutritional supplements like hemp force protein powder or new mood or Alpha brain.

Speaker 1:          00:04:03       We just try to sell you the very best, most high quality supplements that are available in the world. Whatever we can find. If we find stuff that's beneficial, we try to sell it to you and because some of the stuff that we sell at onnit is controversial. We're in the process of running many tests. We just got back the results where we actually just started publishing the results of the double blind placebo tests that we did on Alpha brain. If you go to the audit website, you can see the results of that test. It was a pilot program of 20 people out of those 20 people, a few dropped out. So we were left with I think 16 or 17 people. But we got positive results from two categories, from memory and from execution. The execution of a, I think it's actually verbal execution was the, um, you can learn on a.com.

Speaker 1:          00:04:54       The idea behind it is what you're doing when you're taking something like a nootropic is you're giving your brain the building blocks to produce human transmitters. The nutritional aspects of, of, of thought. And when you take, you know, if you're, if you're just getting that stuff through food man, you'd have to take a lot of weird food and you could take, you have to take a lot of it in like really high doses while mosses and grasses and weird shit that you're not going to want to eat. All of it is very controversial, so we're in the process of continuing even more studies. If you go to the website, you can see the Alpha brain clinical trial results. We have them all posted and we're in the process of a much larger test right now. We're also in the process of tests on several of the other supplements because they're controversial even though we 100 percent back them and support them, we offer a 30 pill, 90 day 100 percent money back guarantee on anything that you buy from on it and either supplements. If you try them, you don't like them. You feel like Alpha brain didn't make your brain work any better. You get 100 percent of your money back. You don't even have to send in the pills. We don't want anybody feeling ripped off. We just want to sell you the best shit that's available currently. So go to [inaudible] dot com o n n I t use the Codeword Rogan and save 10 percent off of any and all supplements. All right, that's it. Boom, boom. Dr Rhonda Patrick's here. Cue The music.

Speaker 2:          00:06:17       I'm just dying to ask you, so what's in Alpha brain, the Joe Rogan experience?

Speaker 3:          00:06:24       Joe Rogan podcast all day? That's a good question. What's an APA? Brandon? We could read it all off, but it would sound like another commercial on top of a commercial.

Speaker 2:          00:06:36       It's essentially you said a transmitter or somebody can serotonin.

Speaker 1:          00:06:42       I'm looking. I'm looking. Doo Doo, Doo Doo Doo. I should give it to you so you could read it.

Speaker 2:          00:06:50       Yeah. Because, uh, if trip to fans in there, that's actually a really.

Speaker 1:          00:06:54       Hold on a second, but this is just one. This has alpha brand that has a lot of different shit in it. It is the stuff that we take. Um. Oh Wow. Yeah. Okay. That's A. Okay. Here's the actual ingredients. Read that right there. Here's the actual ingredients. Dr Rhonda Patrick reached out to me, um, because she had some things to say about some of the things that other podcast guests said about nutrition, about health, and tell the folks what your credentials are, what you do, who you are, why you are uniquely qualified to explain nutrition and health to his phone.

Speaker 2:          00:07:29       Absolutely. So my name is Rhonda Patrick, I have a phd in biomedical science. I did my undergraduate work in biochemistry, chemistry, um, and now I'm doing a postdoctoral fellowship, um, nutrition and metabolism. So I, uh, started out with synthesizing peptides and doing organic chemistry and I got really bored with that and I was a undergraduate student research and research and intern. So then I decided to try biology out and I went to the Sulk Institute for Biological Sciences in La Jolla and I did some research on aging using worms as a model because they haven't really short lifespan. And so it was really cool to do a lot of genetic manipulation and see how that changed our lifespan. And from there I was like, oh my God, I freaking love this. I want to get my phd in biology. And I decided to go to Memphis, Tennessee because a, I wanted to do research on cancer.

Speaker 2:          00:08:25       And a St Jude Children's Research Hospital is located in Memphis, Tennessee. So I ended up going to University of Tennessee to get my phd, but I did all my research at St Jude. Absolutely fantastic place. And then, uh, so I was doing a lot of research using mice and um, some human cells and then I decided I wanted a moment, people just glossing over that I did research with mice and human cells and I mean I could go on and on about my actual research mice people. No, no, I didn't make, I've been most people. But um, I, I did a lot of work on Mitochondria and mitochondrial metabolism and how that relates to cancer and how cells die and how they don't die and what, you know, what's going wrong with cancer. And I got a really awesome publication out of it and uh, nature. And um, then I decided that I was really wanting to move on to something, you know, during your phd you like dig, dig, dig, dig, dig deep deep mechanism, you know.

Speaker 2:          00:09:20       And finally you got to get, you just keep digging deeper. And I felt like I was lost from like what everything meant and what was the significance of it, you know? And so, and you kind of have to do that in Grad school because you're learning the tools, you know, how to use tools to answer questions, what kind of questions and how you answered them. And so, uh, I did really a lot of that and, um, then I decided I wanted to kind of take a step back and look at the big picture and, uh, do some clinical research and apply the tools that I learned in graduate school and try to learn some things using, you know, looking at, you know, people. Um, so now I'm at the Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute. We're working with Bruce Ames, a WHO's pretty famous for his aims test carcinogenicity test where he basically made this test.

Speaker 2:          00:10:06       I could help you figure out whether or not a chemical was a Mutagen, meaning it caused cancer. Um, and so I'm working with him and I'm actually looking at, um, what causes the amount of looking at a lot of things. But I'm actually a fundamentally looking at people that are obese and how obesity accelerates the aging process of people that are obese, die, have all sorts of age related diseases sooner. Cardiovascular disease, type two diabetes, cancer by the age of 40. They like there's a 14 year, a reduction in their lifespan, which is I think even greater than smoking cigarettes. So I'm trying to understand fundamental fundamental mechanisms like why these people are accelerating their aging process. And so I'm actually looking at something specifically. I'm looking at their DNA. So, um, I'm taking blood cells so we draw blood from people that have a bmi of 30 or above or 25 and below which are considered normal or lean, which is body mass index.

Speaker 2:          00:11:02       And you know, it's just problems with like using body mass index as a marker for, you know, obesity, because, you know, some people, some people are, you know, lean and anyways, it's, it's kind of marquee, but I'm not going to go into that. So I'm actually looking at a. So I take their, their blood cells and I, I look at their DNA. Um, and how much damages in their DNA, and I kinda want to get into that a little later. I'm kind of explain what that is, but that's Kinda what I'm doing. Um, I'm also doing some research on vitamin D and I have a paper that's actually coming out in six days. It's going to hit the press. Um, I found that vitamin D actually regulate Serotonin, so it's really cool. That makes sense for people in Seattle. Don't get any vitamin D, they don't get any sun.

Speaker 2:          00:11:53       They're all bummed out. It ain't no thing. Every winter people in northern latitudes, a lot of, a lot of people are, uh, having adequate levels of vitamin D. So it's, it's a really important finding to. So that can actually affect your mood. Supplementing with vitamin D when you live in a place where it doesn't get sun. No, I'm not going to talk about the details of this paper because there's like an embargo and all that, but I will talk about absolutely serotonin affects mood behavior, you know, so that's why I was asking if Tryptofan was in your Alpha brain because trip to fan is a rare amino acid that occurs in protein and most people think that, oh, I eat Turkey, I'm getting my trip to fan. But the thing is is that trip to fan, in order to get converted into Serotonin has to get transported into your brain through this transporter.

Speaker 2:          00:12:39       It converts to five htp, correct. It does convert to convert to that we have five htp and then it converts into Serotonin. Yeah. That's one of the principle of ingredients and knew mood knew mood is a five htp and defend the idea being that there's a sort of a slow release effect. The ultra defend converts to five htp and then five htp convert to Serotonin. Five htp can actually cross the blood brain barrier so that can already get converted into Serotonin in your brain and and Tryptophan. So tryptophan actually competes with other branch chain amino acids like Leucine, leucine, to get transported into the brain and it loses. So losing these branched chain amino acids they're at and protein. So what ends up happening if you're not taking something like five htp or something else, is that um, most of the time you're not getting enough tryptophan transport into your brain.

Speaker 2:          00:13:26       Now certain things can help alleviate that competition like exercise. So exercise. You take up a bunch of branch chain amino acids to make muscle. So exercise actually boost Serotonin in your brain by allowing Tryptofan to get transporting to brain. Alleviating some of that competition from other branch chain amino acids. Yeah, and actually it's really interesting. They've done, you can actually deplete someone's brain tryptofan by giving them a big bolus shake of branch chain amino acids because then it really out competes all the trip to fan that you've from your diet and within like four or five hours, you can deplete like 90 percent of someone's brain serotonin. And then they do all these like behavioral tests to see what, you know, what the, what the results are, what, how, how not having Serotonin in your brain impacts behavior and cognitive function. And they found that it really, there's a lot of things that are sort of messed up if you're not making Serotonin, you become impulsive, impulsive behavior.

Speaker 2:          00:14:21       Your longterm thinking kind of, you know, shuts down. Um, some of your method. He actually, there's a study, there was a study where they compared methamphetamine users, cocaine users, and then they depleted just normal people. They depleted their trip fan by that method I just told you about and depleting the trip to fan. So basically depleting the Serotonin in your brain. You were your do your scoring just as bad as a meth user. And Actually Meth Amphetamine Does Deplete Your Sarah Tone. Isn't that frightening? Wow. So that's wild wild. You know, Sarah, the fact that serotonin's affecting our behavior and that it's basically, you know, Tryptophan and vitamin D are important for that. People don't realize, you know, nutrition effects, effects the way your brain works.

Speaker 1:          00:15:07       It does. And it's so confusing. And when you're a regular person that's trying to go online or read books about health and nutrition and what you need, what you don't need, there's so much contradictory information. There's so many people that tell you you don't need anything. Just a balanced diet. Well, what's a balanced diet? Well then that gets squirrely. You know, the balanced diet includes grains. Whoa. No, don't eat gluten. Gluten's bad, you know, stay away from eggs, eggs contain, you know, it just gets so weird. There's so much information. It's so hard to separate the wheat from the chaff. That's the expression, right? Wheat from the chaff.

Speaker 2:          00:15:43       Totally agree. So much noise out there. And it's very confusing. Um, you know, and it's, yeah, you get getting your nutrition from your diet. Well that would be ideal. But the reality is we have, you know, the National Institute of Medicine that we're conducting these surveys every five years. They call them the nutrition and examination health surveys. And hanes is very notorious. Um, you know, in the nutrition field there, we consider n hanes surveys to be pretty accurate in determining what people are getting from their diet. And you know, these surveys are telling us no, people are not getting what they need from their diet. The majority of Americans are not getting what they need in terms of, you know, micronutrients.

Speaker 1:          00:16:22       Yeah, it's really hard to do so. And to do so on a daily basis requires you to really eat clean and healthy. Mean you can get what you need from your diet. But boy, you have to really mind what you're eating.

Speaker 2:          00:16:34       You have to really work at it. And it's, yeah, it's a lot of effort. Um, you know, it's,

Speaker 1:          00:16:40       and there's also the difference between the idea of you just surviving and not getting a disease and you being at optimal health.

Speaker 2:          00:16:47       Absolutely, absolutely. That's something that our lab works on, you know, but where we've got this sort of theory that it, it's hard to do aging studies in people and particularly looking at different, you know, vitamins and minerals and what effects they have longterm. Um, but that's, that's one of the theories in our lab that we've shown some evidence of it, um, is that, you know, the, a lot of vitamins and minerals, there are cofactors for many different biochemical pathways in your body. Like if you were just gonna go buy a biochemical pathways, you'll see this massive image come up and it's just like holy crap, like, and vitamins and minerals are cofactors for enzymes, meaning they need to be there for the enzyme to work optimally in enzymes and proteins in your body are doing everything. I mean, that's what's right and what's doing everything everybody's doing.

Speaker 2:          00:17:41       Um, and so if you don't have, you know, there's certain proteins that are important to survive right now, like your sodium potassium atpase know, you want to make sure your heart's getting the right signals you want. I mean, if that shuts down, then you're dead, you know. So I mean, some of these, some of these functions are more important. So that's the biochemical pathways. I'm talking about these. And that's just a snapshot, that's just a snapshot. So, I mean, all these different pathways, they require vitamins and minerals, essential fatty acids. I mean, these things, it's complicated. And so cheeseburgers don't, don't give that everything it needs. No, they don't. No, they don't. They don't. And what, you know, what is it, what is it that someone should absolutely supplement with on a daily basis? You know, I would say definitely most people are not getting enough vitamin D and that is, it's a steroid hormone.

Speaker 2:          00:18:42       It's a hormone that controls the expression of over a thousand different genes in our body, which is literally like 24th of our human genome, many of them in our brain. Um, so what that means is without vitamin D, so vitamin D is so important that we can make it from the sun. Problem is, we're not, we're not doing that anymore. Most of us aren't out in the sun a lot, you know, I know I'm not, I'm always at my computer inside. Um, and when I'm out I'm, you know, we're worried about skin aging if you're a female or skin cancer, you know, and so I'm bring sunscreen of course. Um, and as a majority of the people from the surveys, you know, if you look at people that supplement and don't supplement in the United States, about 70 percent don't get adequate levels of vitamin D and actually the way we determine what's adequate is based on vitamin D's classical function of bone homeostasis, you know, so we know vitamin D is important to make sure that our bones don't, don't start breaking down, but in fact there's a thousand other things it's doing and we don't know how much vitamin D we need to do those other things, but to at least maintain that, that's considered adequate.

Speaker 2:          00:19:46       And that's like 30 nanograms per milliliter of the precursor vitamin D called 25 Hydroxyvitamin d, which is what most people, when you get your levels measured, that's what they measure. So what should you take on a daily basis? I would say, you know, definitely you should probably be taking a vitamin D supplement. And what dose do you think? So here's the thing, you know, a lot of different things regulate vitamin D, absorption and bioavailability. Body fat, for one, it is a fat soluble vitamin. So the more body fat you have, the more it's stored in that fat and the less of it can be released in the bloodstream to be circulated and brought to different organs in your body and then get into the cells to do its thing. Um, so people that are obese actually require much higher levels of vitamin D because it will be, you know, it's been shown that vitamin D bioavailability is reduced by up to 50 percent and like severely obese people.

Speaker 2:          00:20:40       So that's one thing to consider is how much per body fat, body, fat. Um, I think generally a good marker is like a thousand I use per 25 pounds, but like I said, 25 pounds. You can be 25 pounds of muscle. And so, you know, I think the best way to really gauge how much vitamin D you need is to just get a test. Just go, you know, if you, if you have health insurance, health insurance pays for it. Um, there's other places that you can get vitamin D levels tested cheaply, very cheaply and it's just so worth it. Like, I get mine tested routinely because I just want to make sure that my, you know, dosing is pretty good. Like I personally take 4,000 Ius a day. Is that a lot? Um, I think that's pretty, pretty standard for an adult. Uh, that's, you know, normal weight and in pretty good shape.

Speaker 2:          00:21:29       Uh, yeah, I think that's pretty standard, but I can't say that everyone should go out and take 4,000. I use a day. It can say that you should definitely make sure that you have levels in your blood that's higher than 30 nanograms per milliliter, which is above the adequate status. And actually, if we look at studies where they've looked at, for example, all car cause mortality, lowering, lowering, all calls, mortality, they've shown that, um, you know, huge like large cohort studies. They've done, they've looked at the levels of vitamin D and then looked at mortality, dying of different, you know, diseases, uh, people with levels of vitamin D between 40 and 60 nanograms per milliliter and their blood had the least amount of all cores caused mortality. So basically they were living the longest. Um, so, you know, maybe you want to have between 40 and 60 nanograms per milliliter or based on that study, uh, you know, it's, it's, it's important to get the levels tested. That's, that's Kinda what I like to, uh, advocate because it's so cheap and easy use

Speaker 4:          00:22:31       and why not very few people ever get the body tested for their vitamin levels. It's, it's, it is kind of unusual that we think about health and nutrition, but how few people actually get their blood tested. It's the future really. I mean we're going to start to do that. It preventative medicine, being able to know if we have adequate amounts of vitamin minerals, it's gonna get easier and easier the next couple of decades. I think you reached out to me because of people on the podcast saying things that you didn't think were accurate and you got upset and sent me some videos and some, some different things. So the sort of describe what disinformation these people were releasing more erroneous information, right? Like, give us some specifics. So what thing will, let's just talk about what bugged you. One of the erroneous facts were that most people, most Americans, get all the micronutrients they need from their diet. That was Brian Dunning. That was Brian. Denny is not proportionately based on, you know, the National Institute of Medicine doing these surveys. We know that's not correct. And in fact they've even done surveys where they've, you know, looked at people that supplement versus people

Speaker 2:          00:23:41       that don't supplement and people that supplement have much more adequate levels of these certain vitamins and minerals. So, you know, that's, that's, that's already the first thing that's not true. Um, and the, you know, the, this recent editorial that came out in the annals of internal medicine was really upsetting because they were basically saying that multivitamins do nothing and not only do they nothing, do nothing, they're bad for you. And you mentioned that, you actually mentioned that on that podcast that you had with dunning.

Speaker 1:          00:24:15       Yeah. That's, that research that they. First of all, I think it's one of most irresponsible studies or the most irresponsible press releases I've ever read because if you actually read what the studies were in comparison to what they're saying, they're saying vitamins don't work, case closed, but the studies that they did were on Alzheimer's patients not showing a any sort of improvement. People over 65 that had heart attacks not showing any improvement. I mean just those two things were two out of the three tasks that they did at. They're saying that vitamins don't work when you're talking about a generic multivitamin to synthetic multivitamins, one of those centrum ones, those ones that they find in the bottom of Porta potties. By the way, when they clean out, they find them. They find those little blue pills still like intact, like they pass through people's back. Allegedly that might not be true. I've never learned. What do I know if I even looked online to research. Now I'm just parroting it like little minor bird, but the studies themselves were were really shocking. I mean, I'll read you the the three things. A male physicians over 65 showed no improvement in cognitive decline using a generic multivitamins supplementation like they're dying.

Speaker 2:          00:25:30       Oh God. Can I please just tell me that? So that study was so infuriating because they were giving these, these guys six. Okay. This was supposed to be a high dose multivitamin and they were giving him six pills a day. Six pills a day. Okay. I take a high dose multivitamin. It's one pill a day. Okay. And their, their total vitamin D levels were, were like 100. I use like 100 I use a vitamin D won't do anything and that was considered a high dose. And their compliance meaning. Okay, you're asking someone to take six pills a day for like 10 years. And then you, you call them up every three months. And did you take your six pills? Well, I took it yesterday. So, you know. Yeah, I took it for the last three months. They didn't measure any, there was no quantitative like biochemical analysis, meaning they didn't measure any, uh, any vitamins like choose one vitamin that's in that your, your multivitamin concoction and see if what you're giving them actually raises the level of that, you know, to show that they're a compliance, be that you're giving them a dose that's actually doing something.

Speaker 1:          00:26:31       So you're leaving it up to the person to take it as well. And especially when you're doing the study, they did. Yeah, that's, that seems pretty faulty. And also you say that you take 4,000 units and they had 100. That's not so good. The other aspect of the study was that high dose multivitamins had no effect on the progression of heart disease and heart attack survivors. Again, they're dying, right? These are dying people. I mean this is not people who. Preventative medicine is what. One of the things you talked about earlier about testing blood. And I, I really think that that is the key. It's not about catching you when you're falling apart. It's about making sure you don't fall apart. Giving your body the natural building blocks to repair cells to keep your body healthy from the jump. And that's what we should be doing. We should be doing in intelligently thinking ahead while you're healthy, while you're young.

Speaker 2:          00:27:23       It's so true. I mean, I'll give you an example. So 45 percent of the US population doesn't have adequate levels of magnesium and you know, I think, I think most people in the fitness community are concerned with magnesium because they're always like, oh my God, I sweat it out. I got to replace my magnesium. You know, I think that's their major concern or muscle cramping and things like that. But magnesium is an essential cofactor for a DNA repair enzymes. So let me explain what that is, because poorly, what's DNA repair enzymes. So, you know, uh, everyday just normal metabolism. So our mitochondria are there, they're taking food that we eat in, whether it's carbohydrates or protein or fat, and they're generating what's called electron reducing equivalents through this whole krebs cycle. If you ever learned in biochemistry and those electron reducing equivalents are really important because they have a hydrogen which has an electron.

Speaker 2:          00:28:19       And a proton and these electrons get passed along inside your Mitochondria, these various proteins, and they shoot out protons at the same time and this is basically the way it generally generates energy to then take the oxygen you breathe in and reduce it to water and couple that to making ATP anyways so these electrons get passed around and what happens is they often, because you're taking oxygen, you breathe in and making water to generate the energy you need to make atp. You start making super oxide and on and you start making reactive oxygen species in your Mitochondria. Everyday we're doing this, we're doing it right now. I mean that's the major source of reactive oxygen species. I'm sure you've heard of that. And your body. I'm in these reactive oxygen species. They react. That's what they do. They react with your DNA, the react with liquids.

Speaker 2:          00:29:05       Your cell membranes erected the proteins and the damage and what happens when you're doing, it's called DNA damage. When it reacts with Your Dna, you know, sometimes you get like an, a, you know, a bulky Adec that's attached on or sometimes you get like an oxide of product which then can cause a break. Your DNA is double stranded and cause a break. And what happens is, you know, the cells in your, in different organs like your kidneys and your liver, these cells have a limited lifespan. And so they have to replicate, you know, I'd have to synthesize their DNA replicate in order to replace their limited lifespan. So, um, when the cell then tries to replicate its DNA and there's just like funny stuff there, it doesn't, it's like what is this? And then sometimes it puts another nucleotide, what's not supposed to be there and it causes a mutation and then you have this mutation.

Speaker 2:          00:29:53       It's like, okay, well you can't go back once you have a mutation, it's there. So, you know, if it's a mutation in a coding region of a gene that does something important, then you could really screw stuff up. And so, um, in order to prevent that from happening, we have what's called DNA repair enzymes. Okay, and they basically take this damage that's there and they repair it and those DNA repair enzymes require magnesium without magnesium. They do not work, did not work well. They're very inefficient. And so if you're not getting enough magnesium, your DNA repair isn't going well and you're probably getting more damaged. But the thing is that this is, this is a decade, it takes decades for this to rear its head. You know, you've got a bunch of you and we've got DNA damage, but you can't look in the mirror and be like, oh, I have DNA damage today.

Speaker 2:          00:30:38       You know, it's like, well, you can look in the mirror and be like, oh my gums are falling apart. I probably have scurvy. So it's like, you know, this is something you can't see and what happens is over a year, over decades of getting this DNA damage, because it happens at random places in your genes. Eventually you get it into place that you don't want. You get it in a gene that's important for controlling cell cycle or stopping bad cells from dividing and proliferating. These are called tumor suppressor genes and when you get it in one of those, you're screwed because now you got some funky cell that doesn't pass those checkpoints that usually our genes and making sure they don't pass the checkpoint if they're funny, and then they'll pass it and they start dividing and proliferating and now you've got this clonal population of cancer cells, but you know, that takes decades to happen.

Speaker 2:          00:31:28       So if you're walking around with not, you know, not sub adequate levels of magnesium, you're not going to know anything until you're in your fifties or sixties and you know, you come down with cancer. Wow. So that's intense. So now when you read something like this, uh, you know, vitamins don't work, case closed and you find out this is the research that they did and this is the conclusion that they came to from the research. That's so irresponsible and so infuriating. I agree. It's, you know, there's a lot of studies out there that I've done Meta analyses and shown just the opposite. You know, it's not like this is the only research that's been done on vitamin and mineral supplementation. The thing that's really infuriating is the big overgeneralizations they did here, you know, for example, there there is an important case were taking some vitamins and minerals can be bad and that is when you have cancer and you know, these people had the opportunity to point that out instead of just saying, oh, vitamins or bad meaning like everyone shouldn't take vitamins.

Speaker 2:          00:32:32       They have, you know, in my opinion they have, they should, they should be educating people on, okay, well you already have cancer. This can happen to you. So you know, the perfect example is full eight. Okay. Full eight isn't essential b vitamin and it's mostly fortified in a lot of our breads and even junk food like chips and I've seen it in chips and crackers and stuff, so I'm not that many people in the United States are deficient in anymore. I think like 14 percent of the population. So it's not a huge, huge problem. Like it was. However I'm full eight is it's essential to make one of your nucleotides in your DNA timing, which means without full eight you're not making mean and you have to. You need full eight to basically make new DNA for these new cells that you're making in your body every day.

Speaker 2:          00:33:21       Okay, so when you don't have full eight, that can actually cause a single strand break in your DNA and it can do the stuff I was telling you about by causing mutations and leading to cancer eventually. However, if you already have cancer, everything that's good for you, cancer, it's like cancer drugs on crack, man. That's like, oh, it's good for you. Yeah, it gave me some of that. You know, it's, it's like they, they just take over everything that's good and because well, you know, they want to keep that. That's their goal, propagate. I want to propagate and take over. So with fall late because cancer cells are, they're dividing, they're trying to replicate themselves. They love fully. They love it because that's what they need to make more DNA to make more of their cancer cells. So someone that already has cancer shouldn't be taking high levels of Foley and really I think these people that wrote this editorial had an obligation to educate them and specifically point this out.

Speaker 2:          00:34:13       There's a mechanism why, let's talk about it instead of making this huge overgeneralization saying multivitamins are bad. What do you think the motivation behind the study or the conclusion like that since it seems kind of unscientific, it's confusing, like I don't understand why they would be motivated to say that based on the findings of the got, unless putting out that sort of salacious headline would get people thinking or get people responding and cause attention to their work. Absolutely. It's, it's attention grabbing, negative negative things like that get press, they get attention. I don't know what their motive was. Honestly. I F I kind of feel like that's part of it. I think another part of it is that a lot of medical doctors, they aren't trained in nutrition and they aren't trained in preventative medicine. They aren't trained to understand the importance of all these vitamins and minerals and essential fatty acids and how their cofactors for these proteins and what they're doing longterm versus short term.

Speaker 2:          00:35:14       They're not. That's, you know, when they're trained, they're. They're actually trained to understand how different pharmacological drugs act on certain receptors. How that, you know, it's, it's kind of a different training. So I think in some cases when you start talking about nutrition and preventative medicine, a lot of people, if you don't know about it and you get kind of threatened and you feel like, oh, it must be wrong, I don't know about this, you know, kind of like one of those responses and I. and I think that may also have something to do with the fish. A lot of the physicians that are, we're involved in the,

Speaker 1:          00:35:46       there's a lot of people that want to be, there's this, this is need to be like a no nonsense person Ho come on and all that. Who, that's a bunch of Hooey, you know, need any of that so complicated. Is that a response to not wanting to delve into the incredibly deep waters of nutrition and figure out what all these mechanisms are? Is it just the sort of a knee jerk reaction to, oh, it's a bunch of bs.

Speaker 2:          00:36:11       I think there's two. I think there's two reasons. I think. One is absolutely, it's a visceral response because there is a load of crap out there and it's hard. It is hard to differentiate between what's the noise in the signal. And so some people are just like, oh, it's all crap, you know, but I think there's also people that just, it's just too much work. Like, you know, I want to keep eating what I'm eating and I want to believe it's fine and that's what I want to believe in. So I'm going to believe it. I think that's another really mindset that needs to be changed. And I think, you know, personally, I would love to see people eating more, more Greens. Um, you know, more more of these dark green leafy vegetables which are rich and many different micronutrients like vitamin K, folic acid and magnesium. Um, I can talk about that in a minute, but I think for people that are just, that aren't going to do that, you know, at least give them a vitamin that's going to give him some of these trace elements and minerals and vitamin D and some of these important micronutrients that they really do need. Magnesium. You know, so at the very least it's just, it's an easy way to do it, you know, it's an easy way to do it. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:37:21       Some, it seems to me that in order to really get a grasp on what is required, what is necessary for your body, it takes an incredible amount of study. I mean there's, there's so much information that you have to get, not just as far as dietary information, but supplemental information is, there's just so much. It's almost feels you feel a little hopeless. Like trying to absorb it all and figure out what, what you actually need and what you don't need. And when you read a study like that, vitamins don't work. Case closed. Good. Now I can not think. Let me push that aside and just fucking have an apple and feel like I'm doing my job.

Speaker 2:          00:38:03       You know, one of the reasons why I made a video to this, you know, responds to this editorial was because, you know, a, because I could have done some scientific paper and gone through peer review and, but, but you know, I want to get it to the people and it's like at some level, you know, this other scientists, they don't really care. I want the people to realize that, you know, because these people, like my dad, my dad takes a multivitamin and he listens to the news. He gets his information from the TV like that generation does and you know, it's just, it's so upsetting. Like all of a sudden my dad could stop taking his vitamin and I don't want them to stop taking his vitamin because it's, you know, it's important that he does take his multivitamin. Uh, there, there are certain, you know, think components in that multivitamin that I know he's not getting from his diet, so at least let them get it from his multivitamin.

Speaker 2:          00:38:52       So I this, this study, there was a Meta analysis that included like 30 different studies and I really read through them all and there were a lot of methodological errors and I point them out in the video where people were just, they weren't measuring levels of any vitamins and minerals and saying they're there were measuring some outcome like cardiovascular disease or cognitive function without any biomarkers. Like there was no biomarkers saying, oh look, we gave him this, this changed, you know, that's important when you're doing nutrition research. Um, and that's a really important thing. And if you look at some of the studies that did do that, for example, when they were giving them vitamin D, they gave him vitamin D to a severely deficient population, which is like 12 nanograms per mil. That's severely deficient. We're talking like rickets deficient. And then after their supplementation they were still deficient.

Speaker 2:          00:39:41       They were still less than 20 nanograms per mil, which is considered deficient. So it was like, okay, well you're trying to look at this outcome. And yet the vitamin D supplement, you know, the dose that you gave these people was inadequate. They didn't, you didn't raise their levels to anything, you know, that was considered adequate by, by the National Institute of Medicine. Now when when people take vitamin D, which is the exact vitamin D, they're supposed to take it, they're supposed to take like d, Two, d, three, d, three, d three. You can take d two, but it's just less efficient to get converted into the active hormone. T three is optimal. D three is optimal. Yeah. T three is optimal and you know, like I said, I personally can't tell people how much to take. I can tell them what I take, which is $4,000 a day and honestly I can tell them that they should have levels of vitamin D in their blood greater than 30 nanograms per mill and we should also tell them, if you're not familiar with taking vitamins and minerals, vitamins need to be taken with food.

Speaker 2:          00:40:40       Yeah, I mean you can definitely get nauseous if you're, if you're taking your vitamins on an empty stomach, plus some vitamins like vitamin B 12. If you're a. If you have a. If you don't have an acidic environment in your stomach, you know, you, you basically, if you have to have aesthetic of an environment than you can't absorb it. So it's like there's, there is factors that come into play. I mean it's complicated and also your gut bacteria also play a role in what you're absorbing, particularly in minerals and. And so when you take vitamins on an empty stomach, if they're not attached to fats and proteins and carbohydrates, do they absorb as easily? It seems that, wow, I think there's been research done that shows that your, your, your body doesn't really exactly know what to do with vitamins and vitamin form. If you take them on an empty stomach with no food attached to them. I

Speaker 4:          00:41:34       mean, I think it depends on what, if it's a mineral, what vitamin. I mean, I'm not exactly sure, but some things you're supposed to take on an empty stomach, like amino acids, some amino acids. You take it on an empty stomach. I'm not exactly sure about that. Yeah, sorry. So complicated. Even for Rhonda, I'm saying that's what I'm saying. It's like there's so much to know about what to take away to my friend Dr Mark Gordon. Every time I talked to him he fills my head up with shit that I'm never going to remember the newest information, Glutathione and this and that and just, it's hard. It's hard to keep up with it. It is hard. Things do get complicated and, and you know, I, I don't have all the answers, but I do. I do dig pretty deep and try to get some information out there to people.

Speaker 4:          00:42:18       That's why these folks who are inclined to be of the no nonsense group, uh, they find it so easy to dismiss this. I have a friend who's one of those, you know, he, he and I were talking and he goes, he was like, he had this smug look on his face, see that thing they said about vitamins, they don't work. And I said, did you read it? And he said, look, I glossed over it. I go, did you fucking read it man? He goes, well, they say vitamins aren't working. I go to some what they say and then I showed him what they actually said. He was like, get the fuck out of here. That was the test. And I go, yeah, that was the test. Old people with heart attacks and they gave him a pill. Oh, they didn't fucking die in a a longer.

Speaker 4:          00:42:56       They didn't live any longer. Crazy. And how do you even measure cognitive decline in people over 65 with cognitive decline by a phone call, by the way isn't real. Was by phone call, by a phone call. So they called them up. How you feeling? Okay. No improvement, no improvement by a phone call that, that was. That was, that really got me. Wow. The specific. You were reacting to Brian dunning. Who uh, what specific things was he saying that you got so fired up about that you had to contact me? Um, well, one was that, that everyone gets there. It's there. Yeah. And the other thing was he was saying that was the vitamin C thing that was getting to me too. He, he was going on about not needing a thousand milligrams of vitamin C and then I looked up some of his stuff and he was also talking about vitamin C, napping important or not doing anything for immune function, and then he started talking about some Linus Pauling's.

Speaker 4:          00:43:58       I can tell you what's wrong with that guy and it a bunch of things, but one of the main reasons he does what he does is that he grew up Mormon, very strict Mormon background and then refuted it and now he's an adult and he's just not gonna take any nonsense. He grew up with all nonsense and now he's no nonsense and I have a unique insight into this because I have some friends that grew up Mormon and now they are. They abandoned it actually in their forties and it's really interesting because they're like children in a lot of ways. They really

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       are. They're the fundamentalists lifestyle like growing up in a fundamentalist religion where everything is spelled out for you and everything is preposterous, but you've accepted that your whole life. You've accepted and you were told not to question and you're told to follow the rules of this, this ideology, when you get away from that and you need to try to like figure the world out on your own. You're thinking and developed in this incredibly fucked up way, the way you make your connections to things like you have this black and white sort of connection thing going on in your head and that's his fundamentalism translated to a fundamental skepticism. So his skepticism is fundamentalism now he automatically is skeptical of anything that might require additional thinking or curiosity or or something that's going to counter what like a, a lot of people think like intuitively think to be true. Like anything that is a bizarre or weird. Anything that like doesn't seem like you think about someone and then the phone rings and it's them nonsense nonsense. Immediately try to stop that. You know, he doesn't want anything to be weird.

Speaker 2:          00:45:50       Can wipe it out from, from a scientific perspective, a sciences so often so often gray, so often not black and white. I mean there are so many. There are so many gray areas and there's so many trade offs. Trade offs are really another thing. You know, where you're, you're doing something, you're, you have this certain Diet and you think it's like going to give me best performance, it's going to give me best cognitive function and make me live longer. And it's like, well there's some trade offs here for getting all these things and I think actually a, that's a really important. It's not black and white and so people that have that type of thinking that have been trained that way and it just, like you were saying, you know, they've, they've built up these connections where, you know, it is, it's black and white and if it's not black it's definitely white. And it's like that's just not how it, how it

Speaker 1:          00:46:36       works. Their religion becomes just this skepticism and instead of it being an open minded objective analysis of what's at hand and instead until they just want to stuff it into this skepticism box, you know, and immediately debunk things. People love to debunk things. It becomes like a badge of honor. It becomes like they get a checkmark right in there, Carlo. Yeah, they do. Well, I mean, and when you're talking about science being gray, of course oftentimes it's not. They're not, but often times it is, but the reality of the science of biology is what's really important to kind of drive home human beings very so much. If you get a phone, okay, look, this phone that I have here, I have a good one. It works great, but you could get a same manufacturer, the same Samsung Galaxy note three. You can get it from somebody else or from from a provider. It's the same components. It's built the same way. It weighs the same thing on a scale and your sucks. It fucking breaks, right?

Speaker 2:          00:47:37       It failed. Let me give you a perfect example, so I was talking about Foley, right? It's important to make timing, timing it. Nucleotide, it's also important to when you eat protein and amino acid protein, it gets converted into homocysteine and you need. You need fall late because it's a methyl donor that then gets methylated and reconverted back in any because you don't want too much homocysteine around and you're in your body because it does bad things. Um, you know, basically makes protein started aggregating and it causes vascular disease and cognitive decline. And anyways, 10 percent, no, actually 10 percent, 40 percent of North Americans have a polymorphism in a gene called the methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase, also known as the mth empty t hfr or the motherfucker gene basically, but 40 percent of North Americans have this polymorphism in this gene that doesn't make it work correctly. And so what ends up happening is they can't read methalate this homocysteine to convert it back into mining. So they end up having elevated levels of homocysteine in your blood and unless they take more folic acid to sort of compensate from that, they're going to have higher levels of homelessness in their blood and you know, which will lead to vascular problems and cognitive decline. So yeah, exactly what the perfect thing. It's like how much full at I take versus how much you take. Or if I'm from Canada, you know, who knows, I mean, you may have this polymorphism and have to take, you know, five times more fully than I do.

Speaker 1:          00:49:08       Well, there's also the variables like how many people grow up and uh, you're, you're in an environment that your biology is not accustomed to. People who come from other countries and then they're in a specific country that's unique to their biology, like if they're like what, what the native Americans experienced when they were introduced to alcohol, like this is not something that their biology was accustomed to and they really didn't have the ability to deal with it. Whereas the Europeans who had been drinking alcohol for untold years, they were so accustomed to it, it was a normal part of their existence that their bodies have adapted to it. Whereas the native Americans just hadn't. Your body adapts to what it needs to adapt to. Your body adapts to its environment. Your body adapts to its diet. Your body adapts to the genes that have been passed down for your ancestor to ancestor of epigenetics are attached. It's just, there's so much. So for someone to say, you know, you don't need this and you do, or it's like, it's, there's so much. So there's so many variables. There's so many components. There's so it's so complicated.

Speaker 2:          00:50:16       Absolutely. I mean, even your gut microbiome like adapts like within 24 hours, like if you're eating, you know, mostly a protein diet, the different like interior types that are in your gut, you know, or are there, they've, they've shown that people that eat mostly meat and fat, there are bacteria, they have bacteria that's like geared towards breaking down amino acids, breaking down lipids, metabolizing glutamine because you're given it, a ton of it. But people that mostly, you know, vegetable, fiber and carbohydrates, um, they have a lot of bacteria that is involved in amino acid synthesis, synthesizing these things because they're not getting as much. But you can take that person that's had this longterm diet and give them, you know, meat and within 24 hours to start to get that bacteria that starts to break down the amino acids. So your, your body is very plastic and it does adapt to different dietary changes.

Speaker 2:          00:51:13       Do you take probiotics? Um, I do. So, uh, yeah, I do take probiotics. I'm there. The whole gut is so, it's so fascinating. Um, I work with someone that's doing a lot of research on the gut and so, you know, I get to learn just just from their research and reading on my own, uh, about the complexities of it, but it's fascinating like how important important that bacteria is in our gut and how important certain types are. Um, and how that affects the way we respond to disease the way we age. Um, so it, you know, it's, it's complicated, it's very complicated. It is complicated in the, um, the environment that's inside your gut. It actually can contribute to your mood. It can contribute to depression and attribute to all, all sorts of various aspects of your immune system. Absolutely info. Like if you're. So you know, if your, if your gut is, you know, if you have basically your innate immune systems being active down there because it's unhappy, uh, you know, causing inflammation and things like having high c reactive protein has been correlated to depression.

Speaker 2:          00:52:26       I'm like, that's actually a biomarker that you know, I think can be used with depression is actually c reactive protein instead of just this vague kind of, okay, I feel this, I feel that will, let's measure your c reactive protein levels. Okay. Yeah. Wow. They're really high. Um, they've even done some studies where they've, they've found they've gotten depressed. Patients found that they had highest direct protein, gave him like two grams of EPA. EPA is the omega three fatty acid that's important for. It's like anti-inflammatory as opposed to Dha, which is most, you know, most of your brain lipitor a Dha, but two grams of EPA day, I forgot for how long, but they lowered their c reactive protein and helped with her depression. Um, so that's pretty profound. That's very profound. The, the connection between the human body and depression is such a weird one because for so many folks, the go to a doctor, they don't feel good. The doctor gives them an antidepressant, they feel better. And then that's

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       it. But there, there could have been so many other factors that could have been manipulated either their diet, their exercise routines, hydrating. I mean, how many people are fucking just dehydrated. They'd feel like, Shit, how many people get out of a bad relationship? And they feel like, Shit, how many people have a bad job? I mean, consider what people considered to be a, you know, depression. Uh, you know, you're, you're moody, you're down the dumps, you're not, you're not, you're not feeling good, you're, you have bad thoughts all the time. And then consider what's the stimulation that your brain is receiving everyday while you driving and traffic in fucking pollution to a cubicle where you sit and do shit that you don't want to do all day. You get home and then you force feed yourself, you know, some terrible foods because you're depressed and you're, you know, just sort of indulging, giving yourself some pleasure and fucking shitty macaroni and cheese or whatever. You're stuffing down your face and then you wonder why you're depressed. Right? Right.

Speaker 2:          00:54:24       Absolutely. This reminds me of a study where, um, they're, they're using telomere length. So telomeres are like caps at the end of your chromosomes that prevent your DNA from degrading and from getting damaged. Um, people often refer to like the tips of shoelaces like telomeres because they prevent your shoelaces from fraying. And these telomere length, they're really, they're there when you're young. They're long, but each time, each time your cell divides, they get shorter and shorter. Like with each year they're getting shorter. I think you lose like 22 nucleotides a year off your telomeres and it's a biological marker for aging. So the shorter your telomeres are a, you know, the shorter your life is basically, if you look at lingers for a young person versus an old person, you can see dramatic differences and stress. Stress has been correlated with taking like five years off your team length.

Speaker 2:          00:55:14       And uh, the opposite has been true. Meditation, they've shown that meditation, there's actually an enzyme that can rebuild your telomeres, but we didn't, we don't express it in high levels, it's called telomerase. But Meditation can actually boost the expression of telomerase and, and cause your telomeres to get longer. So there's really something to that. You know, having a more relaxed, being able to meditate, not having a lot of stress, uh, you know, affecting the way you age literally. And we have a biological marker for it. Um, yeah, it's really interesting. It's another thing, vitamin D I wanted to, vitamin D affects the telomere length also. Um, if you, if you google vitamin D receptor mice and pull up this image with the mice. I'm aging mice, so vitamin D actually does affect the way we age. Um, and they did this study on twins where they looked at their vitamin D levels, they measured their vitamin D levels and they looked at their telomere length and they found that those twins with the highest levels of vitamin D also had the longest telomeres that corresponded to actually five years being five years younger, even though they were twins.

Speaker 2:          00:56:20       They're same chronological age. Their team members looked, they were five years younger if they had higher levels of Vitamin D. Wow. Yeah. So what do you know anything about t a 65. I saw sort of a supplement that's supposed to enhance your telomere lengths. I haven't heard of it. I'm now so, but vitamin D exercise is another one that does, they've done studies showing a, again in twins, uh, those, that exercise the most actually had two of them are length that corresponded to being 10 years younger. And those, that exercise sort of like average compared to those that didn't have an average of like, I think four years. So, you know, there's, there's, there's things that affect the way you age and we have markers for that biological markers like Taylor, my length that, that proves your lifestyle is indeed, you know, affecting the way you age you.

Speaker 2:          00:57:15       I'd read this telomere study and I'd seen this with this supplement. Whoa, okay. So let's check this out. So those two minds on that decay, these are the same age mouse said the top panel, um, these mice are about four and a half months old and the one on the left is a vitamin D receptor knockout, knockout mouse, which means it can't respond to vitamin D. So it's like, it's like not having any vitamin D. If you look at the lower panel, those are the same age, four months later. Look how rapidly that mouse aging without having vitamin D. I mean, there's lots of things going wrong. I mean, I told you that vitamin D's regulating over a thousand different genes in your body. So inflammation, I mean cognitive function. I mean there's, there's a lot of things, but look at that. It's pretty striking.

Speaker 2:          00:58:00       Have you ever thought about going into business, like where you provide some sort of a service where people get tested and then they develop a specific vitamin protocols for each individual person? Yeah, I know. We're like my, my, my boss and I were, we talk about that all the time. Why didn't you do it? It sounds like I've got this asset where I can actually measure DNA damage in your body from your blood and that's also a marker for age because the older you are, the more DNA damage you have and I can measure that clinically. So what we're thinking is like giving people magnesium and seeing if we can, you know, less than that damage because there are DNA repairs working better. Um, but that would be really cool. Another thing would be vitamin D, uh, measuring during the vitamin D, magnesium. Yeah. I think there's, there's a few, um, micronutrients that we know of that are really important for longterm effects.

Speaker 2:          00:58:57       You know, like, like I was saying, there's often this tradeoff where, okay, let's say you, you've got, you're getting some vitamin K but you don't have enough. In fact, 35 percent of the US population doesn't get enough. Vitamin K, vitamin K is found in plants because it's a part of their, they need it for photosynthesis. So if you're not eating a lot, a lot of green plants, then you know, you're, you might not be getting enough vitamin K. um, but you know, vitamin K is often known for being part of coagulation, being important to make your blood clot, right? And that's an essential function. So I'm sure any vitamin K you're getting is going towards that because you want your blood to clot, right? You don't want to bleed out and have a hemorrhage rate. But there's other important functions of vitamin K. Vitamin K also prevents the calcification of the arteries.

Speaker 2:          00:59:41       And so if all your vitamin K is going towards the proteins that are important for clotting than the proteins that are important for not having calcification in your arteries, aren't getting any, and then, you know, two, three decades later and you start to see this calcification in the arteries and in fact people that are given Warfarin, which is a really common, a drug for inhibiting vitaminK , um, they ended up having problems with calcification of arteries and stuff. So, you know, there's, I think there's a lot to understanding how these micronutrients work that we don't know yet and you know, we're starting to try to be able to do some experiments to understand them. But the, the bottom line is that, you know, your body's smart and if you don't have enough of a certain vitamin or mineral, it's going to, it's going to shunt it to the one that's going to help you survive now and help you reproduce because that's the, that's what he wants to do.

Speaker 2:          01:00:37       And these other things like, you know, in Dna repairing damaged DNA or you know, having to brain work optimally. You don't have to be that smart to survive, you know, these things, they probably get the short end, you know, so it's kind of like, it's a vitamins in my mind is sort of like a long longterm thinking when you're thinking long term. It's like, yeah, okay, well I'm not walking around with the acute deficiencies, which is what most people think when they're thinking, oh, have enough vitamins and minerals because I don't have very buried. I don't have, you know, these, these problems that are severe deficiencies. That's like if you're severely deficient, you're going to have some symptoms that you'll notice, but most of these symptoms you're not going to notice and they, they're insidious damage. It's happening, you know, little bit at a time over decades.

Speaker 1:          01:01:22       It's amazing to me that there, there's not a lot of these like a center where you could go and get a full workup done and they provide you with like a recipe for your vitamin supplementation needs

Speaker 2:          01:01:36       the future. That is what we want. Like we want to get it to where we can just get a finger prick of blood and will know different proteins. We can measure that are we know, are involved in longterm functions versus a short term functions of these vitamins and we can say based on, you know, having looking at these proteins, we can say okay, you need more of this and this and this vitamin like that's going to be the future.

Speaker 1:          01:01:58       It would seem like, you mean you'd go to the dentist, the dentist is a normal common thing. They're everywhere to repair your teeth and that's such a basic thing, you know, but the idea of going to someone who measures your blood and finds out what you're lacking in your diet, that's not

Speaker 2:          01:02:15       normal. I think instead of going to a doctor to try to find a quick fix to get some, you know, you're depressed. So they gave you an Ssri. Well you know, we don't know what these, what the longterm effects of some of these pharmaceutical drugs are in our brain. Like they just had this study that came out a couple months ago on anti psychotics, which they give routinely, gave people with schizophrenia and they found that these anti psychotics in a dose dependent manner cause brain atrophy. So. And they followed these people for 15 years, this is the first time, this is the first longterm effect of Anti psychotics that came out that it was a really big study and they showed that these skits, schizophrenia patients like the higher the dose of Anti Psychotic, they were on the more brain atrophy and you know, it's like, so here you are giving these people anti psychotics and you know, 15 years from now their brain is like literally it's an atrophying at a rapid rate.

Speaker 2:          01:03:10       So that's just a classic example of us not knowing what some of these long term effects of some of these pharma logical drugs that we're doing. Especially when it comes to the brain. There's so many feedback loops. Like if you're, if you're inhibiting serotonin from being metabolized or re uptake, I mean you've got serotonin sitting around your body, starts to downregulate serotonin receptors, which is how your body responds to Sarah Tony. You know, it's like there's feedback things going on that I don't think we even understand. And you know, one out of 10 Americans is taking an Ssri so crazy. It's crazy.

Speaker 1:          01:03:41       And I know that they have benefited some people, I know people that they, sure, but it's, it's have they exhausted all the other possible options. I have a friend who's on an SSRI and he recently found out that he had been taking propecia and he recently found out that propecia actually caused depression on, in some people it can cause depression and some people. And uh, he, he quit, he quit taking propecia and he's starting to feel like maybe that was the cause of the depression the first place. But he's unnecessarily now. So now he has to figure out what to do. You know, is it, was it the propecia that caused his depression? Was it going to happen anyway? Is it the SSRI that he needs? But he also eats a lot of candy and doesn't take care of his body and doesn't, doesn't really exercise. And you know, has a shitty diet. All those things can factor into a, a low production of Serotonin in your mind. All those things can factor into, you know, just a clogging of the pathways of neurotransmitter.

Speaker 2:          01:04:44       I mean to omega three fatty acids. Um, you know, 30 percent of your brain is made up Dha, which is an omega three fatty acid and they've shown that actually Dha affects the way dopamine signaling in your brain. So you know, and in terms of like back to the schizophrenia, people with schizophrenia, you ha, you make dopamine in this frontal part of your cortex and the dopamine that you make there negatively feeds back on, on this dopamine that you make in the back part of your brain. And if you don't have that negative feedback, what happens is you start making more in that back part of your brand, you start to have like negative things like hallucinations and paranoia and things like that. Yeah. And so they, they've shown that Omega three that they've actually given omega three fatty acids, Dha to schizophrenia and shown that it actually elevates the dopamine and the frontal part of the brain and helps regulate some of that negative feedback, you know. And so it's like how many people are getting their eating fish every single day are getting their omega three fatty acids for the brain every single day. I mean, I know I am, but I'm pretty much an exception, you know, a lot of people that are depressed. Uh, like I said, the EPA is another big thing because inflammation has been shown to be correlated with depression.

Speaker 1:          01:05:59       I'm a huge fan of omega three fatty acids, especially in fish oil form. All right. Lily, they make such a huge, a difference in how my joints feel. The inflammation, anti inflammation qualities of them are really incredible. It's one of the few things that I always recommend to anybody if they tell me they have knee pain or elbow pain or.

Speaker 2:          01:06:19       Yeah, I've seen studies on how EPA like giving even higher doses of EPA to people with arthritis, you know, they're, they're inhibiting some of the production of like arachidonic acid and some of these prostoglandins and things that are involved in inflammation, which a lot of people are getting because they're reading, you know, they're getting a lot of omega six fatty acids too. So yeah, it, I've seen studies where it like it's been shown to improve it. You know,

Speaker 1:          01:06:42       you were looking at this mct oil over here and you were saying that it's lacking something.

Speaker 2:          01:06:46       Oh yeah. So it's interesting because, um, you know, I, I actually cook with coconut oil and I, uh, at some, some periods of my life I'd put it in my coffee, um, and uh, but coconut oil has lower gas. It's got medium chain triglycerides, which basically is 12 carbons are less, lipids are just like long chains of carbons, you know, that are bound together with hydrogens. So, um, the way your body processes long chain fatty acids is very different from short chain fatty acids. The way it, as long chain fatty acids for one, I should probably get to that in a minute. Okay. Let me start with a chain fatty acids. Basically you get your paper and pen ladies. Shit's going to go computer then it's, it's, it's pretty awesome. You know, your, the way you digest, it's different. It goes straight to your portal vein and it goes to your liver.

Speaker 2:          01:07:38       Uh, and then it gets, goes into the Mitochondria without having to go through this like transport system. And it sort of slightly uncouples the Mitochondria. It's thermogenic and you know, it has all these great benefits for Mitochondria. But I'm an interesting thing with Laura [inaudible] acid is that it's also been shown to be an appetite suppressant. Um, it's through a couple of these different appetite suppressing hormones. I think CCK is one, I can't remember what that stands for, but you know, uh, and it's also antimicrobial, so it, it's been shown to kill off Candida Albicans, which is like a yeast. So is 12 carbons and it's a lot of mct oils

Speaker 4:          01:08:16       don't have work acid and I don't, I just can't figure out why they wouldn't want lower gas had because when I take coconut oil I'm like, you know, lord acids, like the thing that I'm really excited about. So it's not naturally in coconut oil or coconut oil, but these mct oils that people put together some, a lot of them don't have acid in it because they'll, they'll have like less than 12 carbon. So [inaudible] acid is a 12 carbon, a medium chain fatty acids and medium chain triglycerides. How were they exactly extracted from coconut oil? Do you understand the process? I don't know how they do that and haven't read about it. Yeah, there is some process that allows it to have this. Laura and I spell it l a l a U R I c Lorac acid acid. It's awesome. Well, I want to make sure that on it starts making mct oil, mct oil with Lauren.

Speaker 4:          01:09:07       And what are the benefits of Lorac acid, again, specifically for, for combining it with mct oil or making sure that it is an mct, but it's the benefits is one is that appetite appetite suppressing. And two, it's a very strong antimicrobial, so it's like good for your gut. It's, it's killing off like yeast. It's been shown to kill off know Albicans Candida Albicans. Um, it also has the same thermogenic properties. All the eight chain, a fatty acid tab. They'll do some mct oils, have it, if you've seen it. A lot of mct now haven't done a survey. I just look at this one. I see that it says, um, it says a eight carbon, medium chain triglycerides from coconut and palm kernel. To me that says it's not having the 12 carbon, which is lower acid, but you know, I don't know.

Speaker 4:          01:09:59       Another thing that someone said to me that they were concerned about was that it's stored in plastic. Is there an issue with plastic leaching chemicals into things like mct oil? I mean they've shown that certain chemicals, you know, especially in presence of heat can leach chemicals into whatever is in the plastic container. So if like that plastic container sits in the back seat of your car and you'll lose your roll down or something along those lines. I always try to keep oils at 44 degrees in the frigerator because it slows that obviously the oxidation process and all those, the heat, you know, slowed down. So ideally though, which should be stored in it shouldn't ideally be stored in plastic. Should it be in a metal? Should it be in a class? You know, it's not a real big concern of mine is I haven't really put any thought into it and as long as it's just not allowed to be exposed to heat and long as you're reasonably sure that the process from the storage in the plant, you know, the, the canning, the bottling, whatever it is to storage to store that you're, you know, you're not, it's not sitting out in the sun.

Speaker 4:          01:11:05       Yeah. I mean is that something that people were really concerned with Riley with plastic bpa. BPA, which can leach into water and stuff. Yeah. A friend, his girlfriend went to drink a bottle of water that was in the car that had, she had sitting in the back seat. He's like, don't drag it, you know, like it's a fucking bomb. Mom did that to be really the same reason? Right. But the plastic, is that something you. I mean, if you have a bottle of water in sitting in your car and it's a hot day, should you not drink that bottle of water because it's been sitting in your car, it's probably not going to kill you to drink it once, but you know, I wouldn't do it all the time. So what happens to the, the bottle like heats up and then the plastics leach out into the water and then it affects hormones in some sort of a way that, you know, I'm not an expert on. I've done a little bit of reading on that so I'm not going to claim to be an expert here. But yeah, they've shown that BPA can have some estrogen mimicking effects and know that's particularly, I think a concern, especially in, you know, developing males. And I'm going to email you this ta 65 stuff because I want you to check it out. Please check the number, but it's about the tele telomere.

Speaker 4:          01:12:20       Um, so I'm gonna I'm emailing you that right now because I, I had a friend who asked me about it and I didn't know and I felt like you were the perfect person to throw this by. And then laura acid going to with, like I said, I don't ever buy mct oil myself. Like I just use coconut oil. So is there a benefit of using coconut oil over mct oil? Well, only if the lord, I think lorich acids in a benefit, but at the mct oil has lower acid in it. What's the benefit of mct oil or coconut oil? I think they just let not having the other long chain fatty acids in there. And that's also in coconut oil would be those long chain fatty acids. Beneficial. It's just fat bad. So you know, bad fat, good fat. Debatable, right? It's debatable. Yeah, I think so.

Speaker 4:          01:13:15       When it comes down to eating a lot of fat, you obviously need fat. I mean fat, it's important. Need cholesterol for your brain. Sixty percent of your brain dry weight is that your cell membranes here that the vegans out there, you need cholesterol, you need cholesterol. I say that in my act, like as a joke about vs that they say things because they don't get cholesterol. Dude, this is what I'm talking about. So I've done a little bit of research and I plan on doing more and actually coming out with a report on this, but I'll just talk about what I've done. So like I planned, I like to dig, really dig and make sure I'm comprehensive, but some of the, when you digest fats, a, you have to make bile acids and in order to make bile to basically be able to absorb them. And some of these bile acids that you make when you digest fat are carcinogenic. So a d deoxycholic acid dca

Speaker 2:          01:14:12       is, uh, is one that I'm talking about in particular. So that's kind of like, you know, every time you're eating fat, your body's making this dca which damages Dna Damage Dna in your eps, your epithelial cells lining your intestine. Um, so you know, that's the sort of a drawback, but it doesn't mean you should stop eating fat, just means you should be aware of your eating 60 or 70 percent fat diet that you might want to consider some of these longterm effects that could rear their head later in life. I'm also a eating fat increases igf one a because igf, igf one is a growth factor and you probably have heard of it because in the fitness community it's sort of like a downstream mediator or growth hormone and people are always really excited about having more igf one because it's, you know, helps you bulk on muscle and on and things like that. But also it's, if you have too much of it that you're making over a lifetime, it can. It's a growth, a signal that tells, tell cells to overcome the checkpoints I was talking about earlier where, where you have these checkpoints where if you have some damaged DNA that has a mutation, then the cell goes, okay, it's time to die. But lots of igf one there says, oh, I don't have to die. I'm gonna keep going. So you know, it's highly correlated with cancer.

Speaker 1:          01:15:26       One Igf, one being in high doses, igf one being like what, like what doses are correlated with cancer?

Speaker 2:          01:15:35       Yeah, that's a great question. Yeah. So basically people with cancer, they have like, it's just out of here.

Speaker 1:          01:15:40       So people of gigantism, they must have an issue with this, right? Like that's people that have like they have to, like we've, we've, we've had a few of those guys in mixed martial arts that had cancer of the pituitary gland and then they had the tumor removed so that they can compete in the United States. They were competing overseas and other and other organizations. I can pry these to allow these guys to fight and they would be fucking these literary giants. We have a guy in the, in the UFC right now, his name is bigfoot Silva, Antonio bigfoot Silva. He's, he has that disease and he had the tumor removed from his pituitary gland and now he functions on a normal basis, but he has to supplement his hormones because of that. And is that a similar thing? I mean, when you're talking about like high igf one is that.

Speaker 2:          01:16:28       Yeah, well if you're making a lot of growth hormone from your pituitary, I mean are they make these pds people are making a lot of growth hormone? Yes. Yeah. I would assume that me,

Speaker 1:          01:16:39       that's why they're heads are so big and their, their bodies are so distorted. That's what he looks like now. That's after the tumor removed. It's, you know, it's, it's really a fascinating situation because you look at the guy and it's quite obvious that his body's gone haywire. Skulls enormous. His hands are enormous. I mean there's. You get to see what it looks like. I mean, he has all the classic, very good fighter. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:17:03       Actually some people that are making when your, when your pituitary makes growth hormone and then stimulates the liver to make igf one that igf one negatively feeds back on the pituitary to shut it off, but people that have that sort of problem don't have that negative feedback and they ended up having all sorts of problems for one, even though igf one can actually make your muscle cells insulin sensitive, which is good growth hormone, can cause insulin insensitivity in like your liver. So they ended up getting, you know, having, you know, insensible insulin, insensitive liver cells and that's, that's a major problem with a it with that. And aren't there certain amino acids that you can take before you go to sleep that will stimulate your body's production of growth hormone? I don't know. I know that I'm take protein and fat, stimulate the production of igf one.

Speaker 2:          01:17:58       Um, but I don't know about certain amino acids you can take to stimulate growth. I do know. So there's, you know, growth hormone can be increased from exercise and also from the sauna. The Sauna. Oh yeah, the sauna. There's this can increase growth hormone to massive levels. The Sauna. Yeah. Yeah. So like, it's a good thing to go into a sauna after your workout. It's a great thing to go into the sauna after you work out and it's also a good thing to go in the sauna when you're not working out if your muscle, if you're injured because that prevents a atrophying of muscles. Yeah. So definitely. That's incredible. I've never heard that before. My husband and I, we did some, I have a report coming out on this, um, and probably in a couple of weeks, so I can't, a friend of yours or I think his might publish it on their site, so I'm not going to mind.

Speaker 2:          01:18:45       Yeah. So I'm not going to give Tim Tim Ferriss. Oh, okay. Cool. So I'm not, I don't want to let the cat out of the bag, but I did. My husband and I did a lot of experimentation with, with, uh, the sauna because we used to live next door to a why MCA, which had a sauna and so we would just go use the sauna like all the time. And aside from all the research that I, that I did to write this article, I'll just talk about my experience and like when I was injured, um, I had some injuries and I couldn't work out for like a month and I would do the sauna every day and I did not. I was not losing my muscle mass. Like I would've, um, if I wasn't injured. Um, and also it helped me deal with stress. Um, and you just know Kayla and stress and being able to focus.

Speaker 2:          01:19:31       Yeah. It's incredible. And I'm so glad I talked to you today because I thought the sauna was nonsense. No. Was the other day I went to a spa and I got a little massage and then they had a Jacuzzi and a sauna. I was like, who goes in that stupid fucking song? That shit ain't doing nothing. No hot in there. It's doing so much. Why is it doing something? It was just getting you hot. I don't understand what's happening. Yeah, there's, there's a lot of things going on. But like, uh, I'll, I'll, I'll tweet you the link. Please do. Yeah. Because email to me and then I'll tweet it because I'll email it to you could go right to the abyss. There's too many people doing. Sometimes I refresh my feed

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       and I, I can't find something that somebody sent me because it's just too much. But um, but the sauna, it's a fascinating thing to me that because there's infrared Saunas as well now. What's the benefit of that? Yeah. So I haven't done a ton of research on like the differences between just a normal dry sauna, which most of the studies that I read, they're using normal dry dry sauna is awesome. Yeah. Dry Sauna. I'm just just elevating your core body temperature basically. I think, you know, the infrared is somehow can heat you up without some of the damaging effects of the heat or something. I'm not exactly sure. I'll just say that I haven't done a lot of research on that, but um, my, you can get infrared saunas and just like put them in your garage. My inlaws have one in their garage. We have one that my wife loves and she climbs into it.

Speaker 4:          01:20:53       It's like a bag. It's like a. it's one of those bags. I've seen those. She looks so stupid there with her. She's got her ipad and she's watching breaking bad and she's in this fucking sleeping bag. It's so ridiculous. I'm not sure if that's. I think to get some of the benefits. You have to kind of push it a little bit. I'm not sure if you're gonna. She's pushing. She okay. She gets out of there. It's like she swam in the ocean. She said, oh, okay. I've seen those on Amazon, but I was always curious if that's a different one than the image shows a different one. The one that she has, she. She actually lives down in it. It's so silly looking, which is. I thought it was horseshit and food. It has benefits on the brain. Think about when you exercise, you know? Yeah. It's like you're elevating your core body temperature, which is. That's exactly what she has. She clemson that goofy fucking thing and not expose their head is out. Yeah. She, she needs to get her head in there. Right. I'm going to tell her fucking bag over your head lady.

Speaker 4:          01:21:53       Well, I mean it sounds like there's a great benefit to having one of those things. Your House if you have room. Yeah, totally. You know, if you've got a garage, I, they don't take up a lot of space. I did not know. That's incredible. I'm so glad I talked to you. I mean I just went last week to get a massage and just looked at that stupid thing. I was like, Ugh, but hot box wish my gym had one. Like my gym now doesn't have one and I miss it so much. Wow. So how does it stimulate human growth hormone? What does it do? Know how it does. Um, but they've measured it, you know, they've measured growth hormone after people have been in the sauna. And is it a temporary benefit of the hours after? It's just like if you were to, you know, Jackson growth hormone, I don't think it lasts more than a couple of hours either. Wow. That is unbelievably fascinating. It is fascinating. But there's an interesting, and I, I did write a post on this, this tradeoff on growth hormone and igf one a tradeoff and that is, you know, growth hormone and igf one are, you know, they're considered really good anabolic there, help you bulk on muscle. They're also good. It's good for your brain, you know, it helps with neurogenesis in your brain, but there's a tradeoff. They've shown that reducing igf

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       one signaling in lower organisms like worms and flies and also in mice extends their lifespan. So if you take a mouse and you knock out growth hormone receptor, it can live 50 percent longer. Why 50 percent longer, like huge increase in lifespan. That doesn't seem to make any sense because you would think that growth hormone would be repairing the muscle tissue, would you would. Um, and, and so when people actually in people, people that have polymorphisms in the igf one receptor that it's associated with, like centenarians, like living to be 92 in 100. Yeah. So, and that's, that's mostly mediated through. I'm not getting cancer. But, uh, there, there, there is an interesting trade off and I think that, uh, in, in lower organisms, the reason is that having that reduced a insulin signaling helps them deal with stress like their, they have an increase in gene expression for various different genes that are, you know, antioxidant genes like jeans, like glutathione reductase and things like that. Um, and also in genes that help them take care of proteins and increasing neurotrophic factors. I'm not sure if the same benefits are true in humans and humans. Mostly. I think it's a, they're not getting cancer because because of having lower igf one,

Speaker 1:          01:24:27       well, here's the answer about a amino acids and a growth hormone. Apparently there was a, there's a pub med study on it. Um, and they, they're saying that a specific amino acids such as Arginine, lysine and aura, thien orthodox orphanage can stimulate growth hormone release when infused intravenously or administered orally. A many individuals consume amino acids before strength training workouts, believing that this practice accentuates the exercise induced growth hormone release, thereby promoting greater gains in muscle mass and strength. That growth growth hormone response to amino acid administration is a. has a high degree of inter individual variability into it. That's the first time I ever read that. I'm 46. I've never read that. Read that word. Inter individual. That's a great word though. Into it individually for individual variability and may be altered by training status, age, sex and diet. Although a parental administration consistently leads to. No, not parental parent. Turell. Parenteral. Parenteral. What does that word? P A r e n t e r a l what does that word? Parenteral administration considering

Speaker 2:          01:25:48       tineal. Is it? Is it parents? Lineal. Okay. A R

Speaker 1:          01:25:53       e n t e r a l any? Oh No, it's not per ren tr. Oh, let's Google that motherfucker. Lists Is this golden age of information. Okay. Let's look up in dictionary. Here we go. It is administered by or occurring elsewhere in the body than the mouth and elementary canal. What's the elementary corral? God dammit. Fucking confusing shit. Okay. Anyway, a Blahblahblahblahblah leads to increased circulating growth hormone, a concentration oral doses that are great enough to induce significant growth hormone release are likely to cause stomach discomfort. And diarrhea booms on during exercise intensity is also a major determinant of growth hormone release. Although one study showed that arginine infusion can heighten the growth hormone response to exercise, no studies found that pre exercise oral amino acid supplementation augments growth hormone release further, no appropriately appropriately conducted. Scientific Studies found that oral supplementation with amino acids which are capable of inducing growth hormone release before strength training increases muscle mass and strength to a greater extent than the strength training alone.

Speaker 1:          01:27:14       Hmm. That's interesting. How that doesn't. That seems to be contradictory, doesn't it? A little bit. Yeah. I. I'd have to take a look at the study. If it says that the administration consistently leads to increasing circulation of growth hormone concentration. World doses that are great enough to induce significant growth hormone release are likely to cause stomach discomfort and diarrhea. So that means that if you do do that, you will get more growth hormone. You will also get diarrhea, but doesn't that mean it works? Sounds like it means it works. If you're looking at growth hormone, circulating growth hormone as an endpoint. Yeah. So how would they know that's where it gets confusing, whether they know that it increases strength or muscle mass to a greater extent than the strength training alone, because a lot of that is variable individually, individually as well, like what have to do a baseline you have to do with the person itself and do their.

Speaker 1:          01:28:05       Do their baseline and then what they would do without the amino acid and then do their what they do with it. So you'd have to compare each person to their own self. Yeah. That's the only way to do it, right? Because I've had friends that can just. I know I have a friend who just can't fucking pack on muscle. The guy will lift weights all the time. He lifts heavy tries, he can't gain weight. It gets a little stronger, but he just can't pack on muscle. And then I have other friends that they just look at waits and it will just grow. It's crazy. It's like some people, they just have that mesomorphic body structure and they start lifting weights and their muscles just start expanding and growing and they just start getting bigger and other people that they have that ectomorphic thing going on and they just can't, they can't pack it on. So how would you weight those factors mean you'd have to know exactly who you're doing. You didn't really have to judge it intensely by the individual alone. Yeah, I think that's the best way to do it is comparing each person to them their baseline self. Uh, you

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       know, so that's crazy though. That growth hormones in mice allow them to live longer than the converse is true. Also, if you overexert, if you make a transgenic mouse and overexpress the growth hormone, like third expressing lots of it, they live 50 percent shorter. Wow. So it's, um, it's a, it's an interesting. It's an interesting trade off, you know, because oftentimes growth hormones except associated with where you want more of it because your growth hormone levels go down as you age and it causes muscle atrophy and you know, your brain, you know, brain atrophy and incense too. So, um, it's, I, I think it, it has to do with more of super physiological levels of growth hormone, like people that are injecting growth hormones, like people that are bodies that are taking 10 units day that may be a trade off and they get those big bellies from it. Yeah. So, you know, like I said, if you're, if you're, uh, when you make growth hormone from your pituitary and then that stimulates igf one to be tomato and liver, that then inhibits the production of more growth hormone, him and that, that feedback is there for a reason. And so if you just keep injecting it, you're sort of overcoming that feedback because, well, your body, you're giving it growth hormone. It's not making more. Even though there's igf one there saying, shut it off, you're saying, no, I want more.

Speaker 1:          01:30:19       If there's ever been any studies on people like bodybuilders that are taking massive amounts of growth hormone over long periods of time because, um, I read this thing, I'm Dorian. Look at that guy. Oh my God, that's a. Oh my God, it's monster. Isn't that? Um, what's his name? The uh, Ronnie Coleman. Ronnie Coleman. Yeah. He's a former Mr Olympia and I think he probably takes a truck load of pharmaceutical drugs every day in order to achieve that physique, but his stomach, that's like apparently one of the things that happens when you take massive amounts of growth hormone is they literally bulge out like they're pregnant. Wow. I would love to see someone study that to see what happens to those guys when they do that over long for that to be a really interesting study. Well, the bodybuilding industry or the bodybuilding as a sport is so fascinating to me because essentially you're dealing with these chemical projects because that's what they are.

Speaker 1:          01:31:15       They're chemical projects. They're not humans. I mean, when you look at a guy like Ronnie Coleman, you don't get that big. A normal guy doesn't get that big. I mean, you can get big. I, I had a friend who was a total natural bodybuilder. There's photos of him in his gut. That's so crazy. It's so bizarre. And you know, I used to think that that was just big stomach muscles. I used to think that he did a lot of ABS, so stomach muscles are huge until I actually read that their organs grow because of all the hormones at their own fucking grass. It looks pregnant. Look at how pregnant he looks. It's so strange.

Speaker 2:          01:31:55       Yeah. Like I said, I, I know I can cause insulin resistance in the liver. Well, people get diabetes

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       from it, from over use of growth hormone. Now the, the idea that there's a whole support dedicated to shooting as many chemicals into your body and turn you into some freak of science. That's a strange sport. Strange.

Speaker 2:          01:32:12       But you know, there's, there's, there's a bit of a tradeoff. These people are bulking up and they're lifting lots of weight and know they're at the trader, at the expense of a, you know, a few years in their life. So I think

Speaker 1:          01:32:25       they'll say, fuck it. I'd rather be huge. It'll be huge. What do you think about, um, the, the, the, well that's not a bodybuilder. What do you think about the studies that had been done on, um, what is that? Uh, the, the thing that happens to cows? God, I'm trying to remember the, the, the exact function. There's something that happens to whippets and it happens to cows. It's a, uh, an accidental aspect of, uh, of breeding that causes them to Myostatin inhibitors. You did, do you know about all that? Oh, great. I'm going to educate you on the fantastic. Something happens. Pull up miles. Staten Inhibitor dog. It's a whippet. Apparently it occurs like quite frequently amongst these dogs and they don't look real. They look like incredible hulk dogs and what it is. Is there something? Oh, what does my Stenton do? I'll tell you right now my own staten inhibitor dogs it tour dog. Look at that dog.

Speaker 1:          01:33:30       That's real. Holy Crap. Holy Crap. Indeed. Yeah. I'm double muscled cattle. It happens in cows all the time. A mile stat misfortunes that actually occasionally takes place in human beings. There was a boy in Germany that had, uh, an issue, uh, with, uh, a milestone and inhibitors. Like I'll pull that up. Boy in Germany, boy, Germany and he, that's a cow that has it. And um, they've done it in mice. And the fascinating thing about them, I'm inducing this in mice is that the mice lived longer. They didn't just live longer. They were fucking huge. They were like super mice. Yeah. Look at this, boy, this is a baby. Look at the fucking muscles on this kid. Look at his legs. Wow. He looks like an athlete. You pulled up a mouse study. What was that? Yeah, look at the mice. Look at them ice. It's a double muscle mass that lives twice as long.

Speaker 2:          01:34:26       That is fascinating. Yeah. Yeah. I'm definitely gonna have to look into that, but I still don't know exactly what my dad does.

Speaker 1:          01:34:32       Um, I'll pull up the thing about the mice. Yeah. I'm pretty sure they live longer. This is hard to do while you're actually trying to do a podcast at the same time. This is how we rock it here though. We do it live

Speaker 2:          01:34:47       because usually, uh, you know, being bulking up like that is associated with living shorter life. Yeah. So that's fascinating.

Speaker 1:          01:34:55       Yeah. Um, I'm here as a Mario Staten. Yeah. There's, um, apparently there's quite a few studies that have been done not just on the mice but also on dogs and cattle to try to figure this stuff out. This is fascinating. If you do a wikipedia, just like what

Speaker 1:          01:35:21       the Myostatin I'm okay. Yeah, I'll, I'll just do it on wikipedia here. Um, okay. A abbreviated, um, milestone and also known as growth growth. Differentiation factor eight of abbreviated GDF eight is a protein that in humans is encoded by the m, s, t e n gene. Milestone is a secreted growth differentiation factor that is a member of the Tgf Beta protein family that inhibits muscle differentiation and growth in the process known as myogenesis. Myostatin is produced primarily in skeletal muscle cells, circulates in the blood and acts on muscle tissue by binding a cell bound receptor called the active in type two receptor and animals lacking myostatin or animals treated with substances that block the activity of Myostatin have significantly larger muscles and this could be of economic benefit to the livestock industry. However, these animals require special care and feeding with ofs, which offsets the potential economic advantage. Look at that boy

Speaker 1:          01:36:30       so it doesn't say anything about their lifespan. Look at that boy's body. What the fuck is going on there? That boy is yoked. I do not want to go to school with that kid. Can you imagine a bombed out? You'd be if you were both 10 and you're like, why is billy have a fucking 12 pack? And I looked like a girl. It was ridiculous. I mean, what does that kid. I mean, I wonder if they're going to allow him to like wrestle and do athletics. That seems unfair. Kids going to take other kids, just fucking hurl them across the room. He's going to be the Hawk live fire. That is fascinating. I'm going to, I'm going to have to dig into that because that's really interesting. I'd like to understand some of the mechanisms. Yeah. So the gene encoded Myostatin was discovered in 1997 by geneticists doctor say Jim Lee and Alexander Mcferrin who also produced a strain of mutant mice that lack the gene and there's, these mice have approximately twice as much muscle as normal mice. Incredible.

Speaker 5:          01:37:33       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:37:34       But I don't know why it happens all the time and whippets that dog, that one whip it, but it does happen in humans. Really, really amazing stuff. Very interesting. Yeah. But these, these sort of things, um, it, it, it makes you wonder what is that the mouse is body. Would they killed it? They killed it just to show us its muscle, but how can we kick off the skin? Yeah. How rude could have just taken a picture. You don't have to forget fucking crazy. The, uh, the ones who, uh, the mile staten dogs, apparently they sucked as runners, but their appearance with significantly more muscular. Yeah. They still fucking, you know, that's the thing about muscle and it's an issue that comes up and mixed martial arts all the time and I talk about all the time in commentary is that you can't just pack on all that muscle and not have sort of A. There's a point of diminishing returns.

Speaker 1:          01:38:33       It's good to have some muscle, but the more muscle you have, the more you have a muscle that's demanding fuel and you have the same heart and the lungs. It's pumping out two more tissue and it just. It's just a matter of resources. You have only a finite amount of oxygen that you can take in a single breath and it's distributed through all this tissue, all this extra muscle and it. It really has a significant factor on people's in endurance, especially in athletics. We got that guy. Is that a real human that's not photo shopped at all? I don't know. It might not be mad what? There might not be photoshop man. What they can do today is just really, really, really bizarre. I don't think they live longer. They don't live long. That's not a milestone guy. That's just a guy taking drugs. I don't think that's a milestone and guy.

Speaker 1:          01:39:26       Right. I don't think there's ever been a human that's lived. I think it's a really recent thing. I Dunno. Just talking interesting to see what their mitochondria are doing. You know, your Mitochondria or when you're exercising, when you're bulking up muscle, you're inducing mitochondrial biogenesis. That's not really, definitely not real. Not Real. Um, you. There's been a couple cases where they've documented children have it in 2004 German boy who was diagnosed with a mutation in both copies of the milestone and producing gene, making him considerably stronger than his peers. His mother has a mutation in one copy of the gene and in then in 2005 and American boy was diagnosed with clinically similar condition, but with somewhat different cause. His body produces a normal level of functional milestone, but because he is stronger and more muscular than most others his age, the doctors believed that a defect in his milestone and receptors prevents his muscle cells from a responding normally to mild staten.

Speaker 1:          01:40:24       And that is what I've heard, that they are trying to develop a milestone and inhibitor and that mile staten producing stat and regulating the size of your muscle tissue. If they could come up with a mile stat inhibitor, it would increase the size of your muscles. I don't know if that's a good thing. I mean it doesn't seem like it as well. It seems like it would help some people if they're, if they have like wasting disease or something along those lines. But it's going to be really interesting though that when they start coming up with like gene doping for that and they start giving it to wrestlers or football players or things along those lines because it seems like anything that affects the body so significantly as you see those mice or those, those dogs, someone's going to take that shit. There is some online.

Speaker 1:          01:41:14       Absolutely. There's a guy with lining up right now with is we willie and his pants and he's ready to just shoot that in there and make up for everything and there's a trade off. But you know, he cares. Well. Do you follow genetic manipulation or studies on genetic manipulation and the potential for what they're, where they're figuring out these days because it, it seems incredible and it seems that the future is going to be so bizarre when you deal with the idea that, you know, the exponential increase in the uh, ability to, to change things and to alter the human body is just going to continue as long as society allows this research to continue as long as society allows, you know, long as we don't blow ourselves up. This work is gonna continue to go on, there's going to be more breakthroughs. There's going to be more significant increases in the capacity for change and know who knows what the fuck is going to be like just a decade, two decades from now.

Speaker 2:          01:42:12       Yeah. I'd like to see some, um, we've already made some major advances in the stem cell research, which to me is one of the most important, you know, because if you can, if we can get to the point where we can replace our damaged motor neurons or you know, make sure we're not getting Parkinson's disease. I mean, I think that's a huge, uh, you know, that's, that's a huge thing in, in helping us extend the quality of our life. Um, you know, because you don't want an urge to interrupt disease. No, that's, that's something that you don't, I mean there's certain things you can do and you're in your lifestyle to try to not get one. Uh, but it'd be, it'd be pretty sweet to have some genetic breakthroughs in these stem cell therapies and, and we're making progress. We just, we're not there yet.

Speaker 1:          01:42:59       I would like to see a study on someone who follows the exact protocol that science that someone like you would prescribe to him or her and that they do it over a long period of time and they have a twin that doesn't.

Speaker 2:          01:43:14       Right. You know, they do. And they do some of those studies where they're looking at specific things like specific vitamins or exercise or things like that. But a long term study where you're looking at multiple changes. I would love to see that as well. Yeah. One person drinks, one person doesn't one person's fault. They did this study they did in monkeys, you know, and it was like a 27 year experiment I think, um, where they, so caloric restriction is known to extend lifespan in lower organisms and also in this monkey monkeys they did, um, where if you give a, give a monkey 30 percent food than it would normally eat. So you basically let the monkey decide what it would eat and then you say, okay, I'm going to, I'm going to give them 30 percent less of that, you know, every day. And they did this for like 27 years.

Speaker 2:          01:44:02       Um, can you pull it? Can you do a google search on caloric restriction monkeys? And just like pull up the image that compares them a big impact. So it has a huge impact on the way they age these monkeys are. They get age related diseases, less cardiovascular disease. Last cancer brain atrophy, nurse of diseases less with a significantly smaller. I'm the monkeys were not significantly smaller, but they looked significantly better. So it's cruises worked better. Yeah. Okay. There's one picture, I think there's one where they're like for Pam was on one of the writers obese though. Okay. Yeah, there had picked up that one with the four panel. Yeah, that one. So yeah, these monkeys are actually the same age here and that monkey on the left a monkeys. It's in its old age 27 and a half years and it's had a normal day.

Speaker 2:          01:44:52       Like it's just eaten what its normal amount of food and that monkey on the right has been given 30 percent less food everyday for like it's 27 point five years. I mean it's incredible. It's incredible. Way Better. I mean you can just tell by the way, looks he's aging better, but he also seemed body. It's actually he looks more muscular. Yeah. So it's. He looks like he's lost less muscle, less much muscle atrophy. I mean, so what they found, they've done like these gene profiling expression arrays where they can measure like thousands of different genes at once and they've seen that caloric restricting actually change the expression in like thousands of genes. So it helps like genes that are involved in protein degradation, protein synthesis, like all these things are changed and these caloric restriction monkeys, genes that are involved in like, you know, growth factors in the brain, those are upregulated at inflammatory genes are downregulated.

Speaker 2:          01:45:44       So it's like, you know, 27 years left less have constant inflammation going on. And so there's, it's very interesting how, and there's a couple of theories as to why these monkeys age better or why calorie restriction, you know, is can, can help the way you age. Um, and one of the big theories out there is that this, they're sort of like a hormetic response. So hormesis is basically where you have like a low level of stress, like a little bit of stress, and that stress then helps you, uh, changes the expression of genes that are involved in stress. And so you basically can then deal with stress later. So it's Kinda like conditioning your body to deal with stress by giving it a little bit of stress. Um, and this is kind of the same thing with a lot of like xenobiotics like plant, polyphenols, catechins, these sorts of things.

Speaker 2:          01:46:30       That's how they work. They actually, they induced this hormetic response where they increase the expression of stress resistant genes that we have in our body that help us deal with protein stress with, you know, reactive oxygen, species, stress with all this different types of stress. And because we're increasing the expression of those genes were dealing with stress better every single know every single day in that, in that case, you know, for 27 years. Um, and so it's very, uh, this whole idea of hormesis is very interesting where you're sort of giving your body a little bit of stress, like exercise is stress and it's a little bit of stress and it does the same thing. But that whole field of epigenetics is just so fascinating how you know, things that you eat, what you do can actually change the expression of genes. And this actually affects the way you age.

Speaker 2:          01:47:16       And really what's interesting, not only does it affect the way you age, it affects the way your children that you haven't had yet age, you know, so are you familiar with what epigenetics is? Okay. So basically it's explaining it for people that might not be. So epigenetics is basically causing a change in your and your gene. Are there factors that sit on top of your genes? Basically to give you a very simplistic topical view, they sit on top of your jeans and like methyl groups are acetylation groups and they turn, they activate your genes. Then when they activate your genes, they turn them on. And so the genes become what's called express. They're expressing the genes when they are expressing the genes, they're doing what they're supposed to do and other factors can sit on top of them and turn them off. And even though the gene is still there, it's like it's not there because it's, it's not being expressed.

Speaker 2:          01:48:03       But these epigenetic factors don't actually alter the DNA nucleotide sequence like a mutation would. So that's the difference. And mutation changes the DNA nucleotide sequence, epigenetic factor. This thing can be modulated. And it doesn't change the sequence, it just, it changes how much of that gene is being active or not active. And, and these epigenetic marks are regulated by what we eat, by stress, by exercise, by all these various factors in our environment. Um, and so that's, that's one study where they've changed in gene expression from calorie restriction. They've done. Uh, and I heard someone on your podcast, I talk about this study. I'm the sweetest Swedish study that was, there's been a few of them that have been done, um, where in Sweden they keep like extensive records of people's, um, you know, there, there's records of what they eat, what diseases they've had throughout their life, when they were born and if they were depressed, what they died of.

Speaker 2:          01:48:58       I mean, they're very extensive records on people and also they have extensive like agricultural records. So they can say like, during this part of, you know, the country at this time of the year there was a lot of famine or there was a lot of, you know, there was a great crop harvest. And so particularly this northern part of Sweden called nor buttons. Sweden, back in, I think it was like the 18 hundreds, they looked back, uh, during this period of time for whatever reason, it was hard to get in and out of there. And so people really dependent on the crops that were there. So if there was good a lot of crops and it was good harvest, people really gorge themselves, the eight they overeat. And if people, if the harvest was bad, um, there was a famine and people really, they sort of are calorie restricted.

Speaker 2:          01:49:40       They, they basically didn't get to eat as much. And so a lot of these Swedish sciences have looked. Scientists decided to look back and see, well what effects did that have on future generations? So it's Kinda like is there a transgenerational epigenetic effect on longevity? So let's look at these people that grew up during the famine versus feast years and let's look at their children and their grandchildren, see what diseases they had or what, how long they lived. And you know, it's not like incredibly, it's not like a controlled study. I mean, it's very correlative and there's a lot of factors missing, but it's still very interesting. Um, what they found is that, um, males that were between the ages of nine and 12, and if they lived during the, if they were nine and 12 during the famine years, they had children and grandchildren that lived on average about seven years longer than the grandchildren of those that grew up during the, the abundance years and when they corrected for socioeconomic status, meaning, okay, rich people kind of well, no matter what, when you correct for that, when you have people from the same socioeconomic status, those, those are grandchildren of the men that were between the ages of nine to 12 during the famine, years lived 32 years longer, which is like crazy, a increase in lifespan.

Speaker 2:          01:50:54       And they also, they had more studies coming out where those grandchildren had were one fourth less likely to get a type two diabetes and also cardiovascular diseases. So I was like, why? Why do you have to be between the age of nine and 12 and a male to, you know, why growing up during that part of the famine, how does that affect your, your grandchildren's lifespan? And we can't, we can't really tell you why, but there's some sort of theories as to why. And uh, during that time period, there's something, you know, your pre pubescent, right? Right before you actually get, get that growth spurt and uh, the, they think there's something to do with the sperm DNA that gets changed. A little bit of stress, that little bit of Hormesis Po possibly. Um, a little bit of stress changes the expression in your genes, sperm genes and that gets passed on.

Speaker 2:          01:51:41       So it's fascinating. I'm so much to learn still about the human body. I feel like we're in a great time in comparison to other civilizations when you look back and what they used to do for medicine, what we're aware of now, but I feel like 100 years now they're going to be laughing at us, right? Yeah. No, it's um, you know, I think the future is preventative medicine, you know, and there's gonna be some breakthroughs eventually and things like stem cell therapy, but I think diet, nutrition and these things are what we can do now. That's what we can do now we have control over and it absolutely has been shown to affect the way we age period. And so we know this. So let's, let's implement it. Let's educate people. Let's do it, you know, as opposed to waiting around for some scientific breakthrough that may or may not happen in your child's, you know, during your child's lifetime. So there, there's just no telling you know what's going to happen. But we do know right now that we can control certain things, you know, and the way we age through, through our diet and our lifestyle. And, and that's, that's what we need to start

Speaker 4:          01:52:46       focusing on. Um, I want to mention another really cool thing about this epigenetic. Turn the microphone a little bit more towards you. It'd be a little bit. Sorry. Yeah. All right, so this, I'm back to the epigenetics. A study, something even as complex like learning and memory can be modulated by, by your environment. And this was a mouse study where they took mice that were transgenically a modulator to get neurodegenerative disease. And uh, so they put these mice usually when we work with mice, they're in this cage has bedding, it has some food and water and that's about it. There's not a lot of stimulation, a lot of exercise. Um, it's really kind of sad, but they took these mice and they put them in what we call an enriched environment. So they give them all these toys that stimulated various regions in their brain, like the cognitive region, motor region, um, Somata sensory regions.

Speaker 4:          01:53:36       And what they found was that these mice scored better on learning and memory tests. And not only did they score better on learning memory tests, they, they had increased the expression of a gene that's involved in longterm potentiation. Longterm potentiation is that signal that you're making when you're learning. You need to remember things, you know. But the really interesting thing about this study was that these mice that were genetically engineered to get neurodegenerative disease had offspring, mice that were also genetically engineered to get an urgent or disease, but we're not put in an enriched environment. So they were putting that boring cage where they had no stimulation, but they had still increased that longterm potentiation gene, that epigenetic factor was passed on. Um, in this case it was through the egg, through the female line to the offspring mice, which had the same learning memory benefits even though they didn't really, they weren't exposed to that environment.

Speaker 4:          01:54:26       So I mean, just, just having cognitive stimulation, just using your brain more and exercising more can affect the expression of your genes. And that can actually get passed on. It is so fascinating. One of the reasons why athletes tend to develop athletes for children is that one of the reasons we're really intelligent people tend to have intelligent children, like is possibly not just environmental and educational, but epigenetics as well. Right. I mean certainly in the environment plays a component and those things. But, you know, the epigenetics, we're just, we're just sort of starting to understand epigenetics and how it works and it's complicated. It's not easy to study, but, you know, it's, yeah, there's certainly a role for, for epigentics and that. So it's, it's fascinating. So fascinating. It's very fascinating and it's so fascinating when you stop and think about how much we're going to learn, you know, what we know now and what we're going to learn. It's incredible. It's just incredible. You just think of the potential for reengineering the human body. I mean, that's, it seems like we're going to be able to do all these things we're doing to mice, given them double muscles, making them fucking smarter, where we're going to be able to do that to people. We're going to make a doctor Manhattan number from that movie, the watchman. We're going to make a document and going to happen.

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       There's going to be a guy one day that's omnipresent super being that, uh, that becomes a God. We're going to fuck up and make a god.

Speaker 2:          01:55:53       You know, I'm, I'm trying to, I try to do what I can to make myself work better and you know, cognitive wise and you know, and also tried to basically age better so you know, it's, it's certainly like we, we can do things like now. Um, but just yeah, like you were saying, genetically changing someone's like literally like, you know, making, making someone's muscle grow like that by like giving them an inhibitor of this certain milestone and receptor. I mean that's like hardcore stuff that, you know, we don't really know what the effects are going to be doing. Things like that. Longterm comes down army of super beings.

Speaker 1:          01:56:30       That's what it's going to be. There's Dr Manhattan, that's what we're going to have. That guy's going to be running shit 100 years. That's our new president,

Speaker 2:          01:56:38       you know, as long as he's really intelligent, let's make his brain like super awesome.

Speaker 1:          01:56:42       Dr Manhattan was really intelligent, unfortunately to intelligent, so intelligent that he sorta like factored in a lot of things like, well, you know, people live, people die, you no remorse and guilt and all these things are really just byproducts of human culture and our correlation to, you know, a cause and effect and our reactions to each other. They mean it. It took away all the joy and fun. The zest of life. You've got a little bit too intelligent. That problem's a problem. Absolutely. I would make people just smart enough, but not too smart. Whether they realize what's the fucking point. You live, you die. You're just a finite organism and even if you live forever, the planet doesn't live forever. So what do you. What are you going to do here? Yeah, yeah. I mean, I've had conversations with really intelligent people. They talk about the futility of life and I'm like, you probably might be. You're too fucking smart and you think it too much, or maybe not even too smart, but you're thinking too much about stuff that really you can't control and maybe you got to be smart enough to realize that this is all silly.

Speaker 2:          01:57:41       Yeah. Thinking about the things you can't control sometimes that that overlap. Like I get these, what I call it, OCD spikes where it. If I'm driving on the highway, I start to imagine all the possibilities that can happen. Like all the things that can happen with all the cars and it liked those. There's moments where it's so overwhelming where I just can't do. I can't drive like it's too much. It's like somebody's husband ends up driving me around a lot on the freeway drive. True story and it's like, so what I often do is I like to live five minutes from where I work. That way I don't ever have to get on the highway because I don't have to think about all the things that can happen. When I'm on the highway. It's, wow, you're too smart to drive. Well, I don't know if it's that I sometimes obsess over what I can't control and the fact that there's like all these people and I'm like, they're doing all these things and all this could happen and all these possibilities and you know, then it's like, okay, it's like overload. I had a moment when my

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       first daughter was born, where when I was in the hospital in the, the moment she came out of the box, I was thinking like how many different people are being born right now simultaneously all around the world. And if you could see that on a giant screen, I mean it would look like an invasion of babies. If you could see the millions of people, no doubt being born all over the world at the same moment, just, ah, just shooting out of Vaginas, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang. Just, it would be so in the. I got over it, I got over it. Glad we have that ability to get out some of that stuff because yeah, it's overwhelming. It's overwhelming, it's very overwhelming. It's sort of the issue with, um, what, what, what one of the main issues with paying attention too much to bad things in the news, and I've talked about this many times, I think we have a real problem with digesting 7 billion people's worth of problems because anytime something spectacular or horrific comes up from all over the world, we get it and we absorb it and it sort of alters our idea of what the world is.

Speaker 1:          01:59:55       Oh, the world is a scary place and it's filled with evil. The really the numbers are pretty against that. The numbers, like throughout your day, you experience very little violence throughout your day. You experienced very little horrific crime. It's very, very rare in most parts of America, unless you live in a terrible neighborhood to experience the kind of shit that you see on your news feed or your twitter feed all day everyday. It's not an accurate expression because it's based on such an insane number that you're not supposed to be correlated. You're not supposed to be looking at a 7 billion people number, supposed to be looking at a tribe of 150 people. I mean, that's what our brain that's with the Dunbar's number is, that's, you know, we don't, we don't really know what the fuck to do with 7 billion people's worth of information. So we become these paranoid messes when we start thinking about all this horrible shit that's happening.

Speaker 1:          02:00:50       But you're talking about a fucking planet worth. I mean literally a planet worth of information now. And it's like that's the same sort of thing. This just freaking out. Thinking about all the variables that you can control. We were not designed for that. Is it possible that we will, that the epigenetics of living in this life will alter our genes and our expression of our genes so that we can accept this kind of information? Is that something that we're gonna like will start to adapt? Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I mean, they've shown that stress does epigenetically changed expression of our genes. So tabloids are fucking us up, right? You know, I don't listen to tabloids, but uh, yeah, I'm sure there are even just fearmongering, you know, just going on at the Alex Jones website, just paying attention to all these people that are doom and gloom, new world order.

Speaker 1:          02:01:43       They're fucking chem trails. They're putting caskets out in the fema camps and getting ready to mass kill people. It is, it's definitely changing the expression of your genes shed stress distress is doing something bad shit and it's also shortening your telomeres don't need that. But I got a problem too. I fucking eat like a pig. That's a real problem on a die young. I, I eat enough for like two or three people. Like what do you eat? I eat everything. I eat whatever's in front of whatever you want. I've got a problem. I work out a lot and because of that I'm always hungry but I eat a lot. I eat so much sometimes waitresses don't believe me. Like when we go, like after shows, like if we'll do like two or three shows a night, I'll order two entrees and then a bunch of appetizers and I've had people say that's too much.

Speaker 1:          02:02:30       Oh, that's a wager soul. Say That's too much. Like just keep it coming. Don't worry about it. I'm putting it down. Wow. That's a lot of food. Two entrees regularly. Two entrees. And that's after having two other meals usually. Yeah. But it's just if I'm working out, if I'm working out in our work at the same time, two things happened in the day, my appetite is just insane. It just, it's a pit that just can't be filled. Well, I mean your body needs the uh, I'm gonna die younger. I'm not going to be like the cool older mouse, cool older monkey that's got his shit together. Fuck it. Take it down a notch that they're trying to do some of these caloric restriction studies in humans to see, you know, what if it's the same, if it's the same and you know, of course doing the longevity studies going to take forever.

Speaker 1:          02:03:18       So that's hard. So they're doing kind of like a year long study and looking at specific end points and they're finding some things are a little different actually from, from, from the mice and monkeys. All I'm sure there's gotta be a difference between monkeys and human beings are pretty profound difference as far as what our needs are nutritionally. And also the, the, the, the, uh, the idea of stress because we can sort of conceptualize stress in a way that they can mean they're dealing with the immediate threats only. They're not conceptualizing, man, I'm not going to live forever. Man. Asteroid hits me, man. That's not. It's not there. I don't want to die of cancer. Hurt. Oh Man, what if my wife's cheating on me? He didn't. They're not thinking about any of these things. What if I get fired? They're not thinking about any of these things.

Speaker 1:          02:04:03       They don't have anything other than immediate concerns, which is kind of what we're designed for. Right? I mean, when you look at the genes of human beings and the amount of time that we've been in this particular type of a society and the amount of time that we've been essentially hunter gatherers and it's, there's no comparison. We have a long stretch of time where we were just living a very specific way and then over the last couple of hundred years things radically shifted. It's very strange and new direction and then we find ourselves where we are now from the invention of the printing press to the fucking twitter feed.

Speaker 2:          02:04:39       Oh, three printers freaked me out, man. People are just going to start making guns. They're actually. Nasa was funding a study. I'm trying to three d print, non living biomolecules like wood chips and like dental enamel and I know it's kind of cool. Very cool. Yeah. So, so that's, that's Kinda Nasa is funding some really cool stuff and other really cool study I saw recently where they took, they took cancer cells and they cultured them in space because they wanted to see if space could epigenetically change the expression of genes and if this would have any effect. And they found it, did that gravity, did it affect actually genes that are involved in metastasis and when you kill culture, these cells in space, it downregulates genes involved in metastasis and those cancer cells become less aggressive. So then they took these cells and like, okay, well there's a million different things that could be happening in space.

Speaker 2:          02:05:31       Is it the gravity or is it like cosmo raise or something? And so they like culture them in the centrifuge, them meaning they spin and they spun on a certain rotation per minute to like copy or mimic this microgravity. And they had, they found the same effect. So literally like the gravity change, the expression of these genes involved in metastasis. Uh, so yeah, so if you have cancer or maybe go to squarespace or the very top of a mountain, I'm just wondering where they're going to go with that next. I mean, it's like, okay, well that's interesting finding, but so what do we do? Are we going to rotate for, you know, if you have cancer, it's, it's, it's just, uh, some interesting.

Speaker 1:          02:06:11       Well then there's also the issue where you can't really go to space for very long anyway because if you do go to space, your body doesn't really. The body's really not designed to be in a zero gravity environment. We had a Dr Chris, our commander Chris Hadfield on the podcast, one of the guys. How long did he go to space for? One hundred 60, six days or something crazy like that, and he came back and he was describing the horrific moments where he first stepped out of the, the, the, the pot or whatever it is that you landon and was walking on the ground for the first time getting nauseous and throwing up and your body's just so not used to being in gravity and standing on the ground. You just been floating around for so long that your body's just totally baffled and he said it was horrific. I, I thought it had been a wonderful experience. Like what was it like when you finally touched them? The ground you'd been up in space for so long. He's like, it is unbelievably awful. Wow. Yeah. Your, your, your body's just in chaos. It doesn't know what you've been doing this whole time.

Speaker 2:          02:07:14       Yeah, it's pretty crazy. The body's crazy. It is very crazy and it's very. It does adapt. I mean there's things that are.

Speaker 1:          02:07:21       No, it does adapt. It's so endlessly fascinating. It's so endlessly fascinating. When you find out what has been learned about the body, how many studies have been done, what, what information is out there and then yet how much we need to learn, how there is to know how much there is to discover. It's just we're not even close. Not even close. We're just learning, which is again, why it's so infuriating when you read, you know, vitamins don't work. Case closed. Fuck you. No, it's not. It's not that simple. A lot of vitamins do work and there's been a lot of studies showing that they work well. It's not an accident that we've isolated vitamin C, it's not an accident that we know that vitamin B 12 gives you energy. I mean these are. This is science that created all this, so all these no nonsense people.

Speaker 1:          02:08:03       There is a lot of fuckery when it comes to vitamins. There's a lot of fuckery when it comes to nutrition, you, you, you're always reading about some, you know, false claims that you know, this company has or that company has, are these pills. However though you're, you, we hear about things all the time and it comes to nutrition and supplementation, especially when it comes to athletics, supplementation, things that are purported to deliver, you know, amazing muscle growth or you know, they've found that a lot of those things that are purported to give muscle growth or erection pills. Here's a perfect example. You know what those things are. When there's a cialis and Viagra, they just sell that. They sell it as some herbal supplement, but they put in pharmaceutical drugs. They get, they buy that shit in bulk and they sell it and it actually does work, but their pharmaceutical drugs, but because of the fact that the restrictions are so small and the band or the punishment of doing that is so small. We had a aubrey marcus in from on it who was describing the whole process of one. One of these companies gets caught selling Viagra as one of these herbal sexual stimulants. They just get a, like a little fine. So they changed the name, they open up and under a different company and go right back at it and they just have the rocket dick or whatever the fuck they call it. I mean, there was a study that

Speaker 2:          02:09:20       it came out not long ago. They showed that like 70 percent of like herbal supplements on the market aren't, aren't actually what you think they are. So in a lot of cases people are just putting some other plane in there and it's like, you think you're getting, you know, Achalasia or you know, and it's like some other crap. And so that's like, I think there's a whole, you know, uh, an opening for people to actually do like some DNA barcoding where you can actually test, you know, what's in a supplement and start a company where it's like, I've, I've tested these supplements and they're actually what they're saying they're supposed to be, you know, because it's like you've got a huge problem when people are trying to buy certain supplements. And then they're not even getting what they think their body, regardless of whether or not there's any science to back up with what they think they're buying. Is he doing anything? I mean the point is they should, they should be getting what they think they're getting.

Speaker 1:          02:10:09       And then of course there's a huge issue of homeopathic cures, which are mostly nonsense. There's a huge homeopathic industry. There's essentially selling you sugar, you total bullshit. They've. There was a recent study on homeopathic the, the actual ingredients and some homeopathic cures and

Speaker 2:          02:10:27       a lot of it was sugar. So like they're literally selling sugar pills. Yeah. There's a difference between, you know,

Speaker 4:          02:10:34       not having certain vitamins and minerals and fatty acids in your diet and things that can, you know, if it affects your immune system and affects cognitive function, it affects all these different things. And then taking all this other crap that I don't know, people like the I the idea of some exotic thing isolated from somewhere and it's like, oh, it does this because it's exotic and you know, the reality is, is people, they should be focusing on what they're not getting. That's essential for, you know, things that we know that's essential for the proteins in their body to work. Um, and so that a lot of that homeopathic stuff, it gets mixed in with the vitamins and minerals to. And that's really irritating because it's really. There are two different things. Yeah. Nutrition and homeopathic. Yeah. There's a lot of nonsense if you're interested in that.

Speaker 4:          02:11:21       Just Google a homeopathic medicine, sugar pills and there's all of studies, there's a lot of different stuff on, on sugar pills actually. They've shown they've done a placebo effects studies using sugar pill pills, um, where they've published. They've given someone a placebo. I mean the whole point of the study was not for the person conducting it to not know who had the placebo. It was, okay, let's see if the placebo effect is real. And it absolutely is real. I mean there are people, people, if they think they're getting something, they will experience something, you know, and it's real to them. And then actually they, they don't get sick as much or they feel better, you know. So there's, there's definitely something to be said for a sugar pill. And maybe that's part of the success of things like homeopathy. That's really confusing, isn't it? The placebo effect is absolutely fascinating that you can send the mind a signal or, or instill it in a mind by taking a pill and then the mind believes that medicine is there and then conducts business as if this new found healing property exists.

Speaker 4:          02:12:23       Yeah. No. And it's, it is real. The placebo effect is real, but we don't know why. Right. I mean, I haven't really done a ton of research and understanding why, but yeah, it's, it's, it's interesting how your brain can, you know, make your, make yourself think that something's working and you actually can force yourself to be healthier. I mean, so it's fascinating. It is very, very, very fascinating. Endlessly, endlessly. So, I mean, the human being is like a human body is to me essentially like the most incredibly complex computer ever. And we don't have a guidebook for it right now. We're just talking about the physical aspects of it. Forget about managing your mind, your thought process, which also can lead to a lot of ailments and incorrect thinking and thinking apps. I mean, when I started getting, when I started researching these studies on the effects of, you know, depleting trip to fan from your brain and how like normal people all of a sudden become like, impulsive, impulsive, like, you know, violence and impulsive behaviors and recidivism. So they, like, they'll do these tests were they punished for doing something wrong and they'll. And they'll keep repeating the same thing. I mean, I was like, I can't believe

Speaker 2:          02:13:32       you can change someone's behavior by depleting trip to fan. Like that's, that was really, you know, amazing to me. And, and the way that nutrition affects your brain function in general and behavior is really interesting to me because it suggests that we have to some degree, some control over our cognitive function behavior. And I think that we should be optimizing that as much as we can to, you know, perform better to have better cognitive skills and to also better society by behaving better. You know, so, you know, they've, they've done studies with like school children where they've giving them like omega three fatty acids and multivitamins and it's absolutely, you know, how effected their, their, um, Iq scores in some cases by like dramatic effects and even affected juvenile delinquency and juvenile. Yeah, it's effected, effected juvenile delinquency. There's been studies showing that giving these people a multivitamin and omega three fatty acids.

Speaker 2:          02:14:24       So it's hard to pinpoint what specifically in it, but I think it's a combination of everything because these pathways are all working together, but it's affecting their. What I think is happening is, you know, it's also affecting their serotonin and so they're, you know, they're not, they're not as impulsive, they're there, you know, it's more like long term thinking there. It's, it's absolutely fascinating that you can actually, through nutrition affects someone's behavior. There was another study where they had given prisoners omega three fatty acids and it affected their aggressive outbursts. Um, you know, because that's another, that's a whole other topic. You know, you've got a population of people that's incarcerated and knows what they're getting fed, probably deficient in multiple micronutrients, including omega three fatty acids and Vitamin D.

Speaker 1:          02:15:11       Guy on recently is kid war machines, have a MMA fighter, John Copa neighbors, his real name war machines, his fighting name, pretty cute, and he was talking about a year that he did in prison where they. They gave him 1500 calories a day and it was horrible nutrition and just how his body just felt like it was wasting away because of it.

Speaker 2:          02:15:29       Yeah. See, this is, I would like to see, you know, we're spending money to keep people in prison. You know what, why not give them, give their brain the proper nutrients they need to try to heal itself, to try to make it work better. You know,

Speaker 1:          02:15:43       you're talking silly because you're talking about a person wants to fix people. They're just trying to make money. I mean they don't really care, but when you're dealing with privatized prisons and you're also dealing with prison guard unions that are trying to keep people in prison, so they have prison guards that have jobs. I mean, you're, you're not dealing with a whole system where the entire system is dedicated to actually rehabilitating people. That sort of bullshit. They pretend it is there. It's just a system.

Speaker 2:          02:16:10       Someone can start a company, you know that, that, that donate. That basically is a charity that we give them to. These people donate money and we give people these vitamins, these Omega three and vitamin D and multivitamins in prison. People are not gonna.

Speaker 1:          02:16:23       They're going to say, listen, if you want to give people nutrients and vitamins, give it to poor people. Give it to poor people that haven't committed crimes, don't ever

Speaker 4:          02:16:30       give it to prisoners. Don't try to fix presidents. I see what you're saying. I see your point of view, but I, I see how people are going to say, if you're going to start somewhere, don't start with people that have already fucked. We should definitely start with. We should definitely give him the poor people also. I mean, you know, we need to make sure that, that these people that can't afford to eat all these greens and fish every day, we can at least give them a fish oil pill and you know, a vitamin D pill and multivitamin to help give, give him some of those micronutrients, particularly the children that are not doing well and on their cognitive tests and having behavioral problems and it's like people don't want to ever think about the fact that nutrition plays a role in that. It's not just all genetics, it's not all environment and you know, in terms of being abused or.

Speaker 4:          02:17:14       I mean that definitely plays a role for sure that there is, there is a component of nutrition that we can control to some degree and it's cheap. It's a cheap solution. Vitamins aren't that expensive. I mean, relatively speaking you can, you can get a Omega three pill, vitamin D, pill, multivitamin, and it's not that much money a month. Now there was something else that you said that you wanted to talk about. The Dave asprey had said that was incorrect. That was the epigenetic tests. Uh, they, uh, the Swedish study I had listened to the podcast that you'd had some time ago and you know, he's got good information, I don't want to say otherwise, but it was just, I wanted to correct that because he had said that the, the children from the well fed, uh, the ones that were grandchildren of the well fed children lived, got type two diabetes less.

Speaker 4:          02:18:06       That was completely wrong. It was, it was the opposite. Yeah. He's a collector of interesting ideas and uh, although I liked the guy, he gets shit wrong and I don't know if he's always that good about recognizing when he has done that and correcting themself. We, we've had a real issue with him as of lately because of microtoxins. I don't know if you're aware of the whole issue of micro topics. A little bit about it. Um, yeah. I'm not concerned about mycotoxins and coffee. I'm more concerned about not getting my Omega three and all the other micronutrients and involved in. I mean aflatoxins certainly something I don't want, but that's peanuts. So mycotoxins in peanuts are a real issue as well. And corn, that's a. that's another real issue. Here's the issue. This guy is selling coffee and now we're selling this coffee through on it. That was supposed to be the cure to this issue. Is this the coffee microtoxins? No, you're actually drinking Hawaiian Kona coffee that I started drinking. I started drinking right after we got our results back on the mycotoxins tests. So his. His contention was that 70 plus percent, whatever it was of all coffee, is infected with mycotoxins and they make you sick. That make the coffee tastes bitter. They make it tastes

Speaker 1:          02:19:28       bad and then make you feel bad. I took too much of this at face value and parotid, a lot of the things that he said and then we decided to start looking into it ourselves. Well, they've known about mycotoxins and coffee for a long time. There's a pub med study from 1980 about mycotoxins and coffee. It's always been an issue, but they've been able to resolve that issue with wet processing, wet processing. The. They know how good coffee providers know how to eliminate this from coughing. We tested for random coffees to random one starbucks, one random bag from whole foods, one coffee that we sell, which is the upgraded coffee that Dave produces, which is good coffee, good single source coffee, and another one called caveman coffee. None of them tested positive for mycotoxins and so we'll have 70 percent of all co coffee as mycotoxins and we had three bags other than the upgraded coffee.

Speaker 1:          02:20:21       None of them are taking is upgraded, quote unquote bulletproof process, which you won't resolve. You know, he won't reveal what this process is publicly. And so I kind of feel like it might. There's some bullshit there for sure. It's not, there's no way we're going to find four bags of coffee and test them. So our friend Tate, who runs bulletproof coffee, he tested two bags and his coffee and this upgraded coffee and allegedly he found below threshold levels of mycotoxins in Dave's coffee. So I didn't know. I didn't conduct that test. I wasn't a part of that test. I don't know if it's right, but what the fuck, you know, like I feel like when you're a guy who's running on and doing these kinds of interviews and spewing out all these facts, you have to be really fucking careful. You know, you have to be really fucking careful to what you're saying is true.

Speaker 1:          02:21:18       And if what you're saying turns out to not be accurate and I find out that you're profiting from what you're saying, it becomes, it becomes bad. It becomes a real problem. And we, that's where we are with this upgraded coffee thing. Um, we still sell it at, on it because it is really good coffee. But we've removed all of our, all the literature on the mycotoxin issue, all of the literature on that. Because when you talk to the people that are in the know in the coffee industry, coffee growers, people who grade coffee and rate coffee, they actually have a rating system that is a, you know, like you'd get a 94 and 95 and you have excellent coffee. Well, your coffee loses points of a test positive for mycotoxins. They test it, you know, so he's, he's sort of created this issue and you know, and made this issue out to be like, there's a reason why you have bitter coffee.

Speaker 1:          02:22:09       It's a mycotoxin. Well, no it's not. It's fucking burnt coffee, man. Things are better. And coffee. Yeah, you, if you leave it on the pot and then he stays heated, it gets, it gets bitter. I mean, that's, they've known that for years. There's, there's no studies out there that show that coffee with mycotoxins in it. Test bidder and you also like this shit of him saying that all these different coffees have tested positive for mycotoxins. There's no tests. He's got no results. Like you can't just go around saying that without producing the data publicly. You have to have to.

Speaker 1:          02:22:41       I've never, I mean, I certainly, like I said, aflatoxins one thing where, you know, that certainly can cause cancer. Um, I've never really been that concerned about mycotoxins in my coffee being a carcinogen. I'm more concerned about my own metabolism generating reactive oxygen species because that's generating more, you know, reactive oxygen species. Then in some micro toxins in coffee. And that's, that's, you know, well, mycotoxins, most certainly existed. They existed. Human breast milk, how about that? I'm sure they exist. I mean I've gotten mycotoxin loopy after all. They're starting to read the different areas where mycotoxins have been found or aspects of mycotoxins that can affect human health. But the coffee one, they seem to have licked. They know what the fuck it is, they know what causes it and they know how to deal with it. It's called wet processing. They know how to not store beans where they can get moldy.

Speaker 1:          02:23:35       They know how to prevent these things from happening. So this guy, they have incentive to do that. So this guy is sort of, you know, he used my platform in a way that I don't think is totally ethical and you know, he claims that he's telling the truth and he claims that, you know, if you sign a nondisclosure agreement, he'll show you always, you know, all his testing methods like. But it's, it seems to be bullshit. And I feel bad because I liked the guy and I think that, first of all he's not. I mean, he's a collector of ideas. He doesn't have a formal education in education, in nutrition. This is not something that he's got a phd and he's not, you know, essentially is what I'm saying. So, you know, when I talked to you about it, I'm getting it from someone who went to really good schools and you do research every day for a fucking living with that's what you do.

Speaker 1:          02:24:23       I do. Um, and, and like I said, I'm not an expert in microtoxin, but I've sort of not really been worried about it and coffee, just based on the little bit of reading that I've done, I haven't, it hasn't, seems like it can be an issue if you have mycotoxin infested, infected coffee. But if, if it does take, it's really infected. We're talking like, you know, if it's like, if there's a trace amount of it, you know, I don't really think it's, that's the, well that's what we found. Well that's not what we found. What we found is the zero. But what tate, my friend tate and caveman coffee found in his is below threshold levels of two different types of mycotoxins. Which is not gonna Affect you at all? Well, not only that, they say that anything that's gonna increase the expression of genes that are involved in stress resistance can have a little bit of a hormetic effect possibly. That's interesting. Yeah. Well, the other thing was that the actual process of roasting the beans destroys a huge amount of the microtoxins. A huge amount of the mold gets. It's, gets killed 70 to 80 percent in some cases. It's reminds me, there's this whole linkedin thing

Speaker 2:          02:25:24       is another thing when you're saying he, you know, that someone destroys the roasting process, destroys the microtoxin. Well, this whole thing with lectins. Two, that's a big, uh, I don't know who, you know, who started this linkedin thing, I think maybe Mercola, Mark Macola, but I think he, he talks about it all. So, um, and it's like, oh, you can't eat beans because beans have lectins and lectins cause an immune response in your gut. And this is going to cause leaky gut. And that's not the whole story. It's, it's a little more complicated. For one, lectins are activated by heat. And so unless you're chewing raw kidney beans or lentils, you're probably not activating an immune response in your gut. And actually beans are really high in fiber and fiber gets broken down into short chain fatty acids, which actually prevents the immune response in your gut. So it's actually doing the opposite. Um, you know, so there's, there's people, some people have good information, but they also have some bad information. And Yeah, I agree with you. You gotta be careful. I mean anyone that's offering you like a magic bullet, like this is, this is it, this is the cure. This is, there's, it's complicated and they're straight up.

Speaker 1:          02:26:30       And I should be clear when I say that my roasting, the roasting process supposedly eliminates mycotoxins. It's just destroys the mold that causes the Mycotoxins, which is the source upstream of it. Yeah. You're roasting doesn't actually destroy mycotoxins, but it does destroy the mold. The 70 to 80 percent of it in some cases. So it's another one of those cases where there's too much to know. There's too much to learn. And I have a guy on, he says he's an expert in some of the things that he says seemed to be bullshit and that's the big one that everyone has mold in their coffee except me. I know how my super secret way of getting rid of him, but I fucking bought it. So here we have a problem that uh, we've allowed to be created, but I don't, I'm not drinking anymore. Um, because of that, just at a general principle will probably eventually stop selling it. It is good coffee. It's good. Single source coffee. There's nothing wrong with the coffee. Just for me. I prefer the coffee from Hawaii. I love Kona coffee. It has a really great taste to it. So I just started drinking that. Upgraded coffee. Yeah. Well, not only that, a lot of people would buy it based on this premise that has not been proven that most coffee has mold in it with no fucking evidence whatsoever to back that up.

Speaker 2:          02:27:39       I haven't seen any evidence that most coffee has microtoxin and I haven't seen evidence that it has levels of micro toxins that are harmful. So, you know,

Speaker 1:          02:27:49       there was one test that showed that in the bitterness area, there was one test that showed that mice, when they were given saccharin infused with Mycotoxins, tended to avoid that Saccharin with, uh, with microtoxins. But, but saccharin sweet thing, I mean, it's a sweet product. I who knows why they're avoiding the taste of the Mycotoxins, who knows if their bodies have figured out that it's fucking poison. I mean, I don't know, but running around saying that the reason why coffee is bitter is because of just stating it as fact. Tenants the same thing that's in the Canon. So that's what, that's, that's why that's the bitter part. Coffee and, but he causes that. Uh, no, they're naturally in, in, in the plants and it gets burned. That burnt taste, you know, I don't know. That burnt taste hasn't been done enough. Research to know what the he does to that process.

Speaker 1:          02:28:44       It's possible. Yeah. Well that's what they say mean. The coffee experts say when I fucking read more about coffee over the last three weeks than I've ever wanted to read or thought I would ever have to. Um, but coffee experts, here's where it gets pretty clear all call bullshit, all of them call bullshit. And what are you saying? They all clapped bullshit across the board, not just coffee providers, not just coffee growers with coffee tasters, coffee experts across the board think that what he's saying is horseshit. That's usually a good sign. This one guy who's not even a fucking nutrition expert and he's not, it doesn't have a phd in nutrition. He comes along with these incredible claims and also has this incredible method to alleviate this ailment. I mean, it's one of those classic examples, you know, create a problem and then offer a solution profit, you know?

Speaker 1:          02:29:35       And that's, that's, it seems to be what's been done here. Whether or not it's intentional or not, I don't even think it was intentional, but I think that he's one of those guys that once he goes down a path to say he was wrong or two to try to win some other product on something, it's hard to then say you were wrong situation where it's. Yeah, it's, it's tricky because it's not bad coffee. It's good coffee. It tastes good. It's, you know, from our testing, it's mycotoxin free. It's single source coffee. If he just sold it as that, it would be a really good product. There's nothing wrong with it. The other thing about coffee experts is they want to know when it was, when it was roasted, they want to know. They want to know like it's like there's a time between when the coffee's roasted and how long you should keep it while it's still fresh.

Speaker 1:          02:30:23       The he doesn't offer that. It doesn't have any of that. So they're calling bullshit on that too though. If you really cared about coffee, you would let let us know when it's roasted. Should have an on a roasted by date or roasted on date. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It sounds like it's pretty fricking complicated. It's too complicated. I have children and jobs and things to do. I don't have time to deal with this shit, but I've, you know, I am obligated now because I got thrust into this situation. It's nice to talk to someone like you to clear up some of the misconceptions of health and nutrition and to find out what's real and what's not and what what are issues. When I talked to a guy like Brian dunning was like, you don't need vitamin C. You don't need this. You don't need that, but look at him. He's fucking totally shaped as fat and just not taking care of his body. He's a no nonsense guy who got fucked because he was a kid and he was raised a Mormon and now he's trying to counteract that by being a skeptic I. that's really essentially what's going on, but that guy can fuck with people's heads because he's not an expert. He's clearly not an expert in a lot of things,

Speaker 2:          02:31:28       so he really shouldn't be reviewing scientific literature in my opinion, like he needs to get some people that really know how to do that. If he's going to start trying to critically analyze science. That's my opinion because I've read some of his stuff where he's trying to critically analyze it. For example, um, this, this linus pauling, he's got something on his website talking about how a vitamin C can't, has no effect on cancer incidents or can help if you already have cancer, can help, you know, kill the cancer cells. And He puts up these studies by the Mayo Clinic that couldn't repeat these early studies that were done by Linus Pauling and cameron, I forgot his name anyways, I'm in the late seventies, but you know, anyone that's scientists will look at that and go, oh, pauling and cameron gave their patients who are cancer patients, vitamin C intravenously. And they did that for a reason because you can only orally absorbed so much vitamin C and we'll get into your bloodstream.

Speaker 2:          02:32:28       But intravenously you can like, you know, raise it to like millimolar concentrations. And so, uh, the two mio clinic studies that repeated it repeated it in quotations gave him orally. And so, you know, you can't, you can't repeat a study and change the method of administration from oral to intravenous and say, Oh yeah, we repeated the study. It didn't work. So when your credit, when you're critically analyzing data, you need to focus on those sort of details because they are actually really important. And a recent study just came out like two weeks ago where they took patients, female patients, I had ovarian cancer and they gave them vitamin C intravenously and they're doing their standard chemo. It's really hard nowadays to do any sort of, um, unconventional cancer treatment that's not, you know, because it's like you don't want to just kill someone. I mean, it's, it's hard. So anyways, they did it with the chemotherapy and it actually killed it. They killed the cancer cells better and it also alleviated a lot of the negative symptoms associated with the chemo. And this was to study published in science, translational medicine, which is a pretty good journal for translational research. In fact. So

Speaker 1:          02:33:38       Brian, Brian has several problems with some of the things he puts out, you know, he's accused me of being a pseudoscience shill and even after the podcast, even after the podcast where he came on and had all these really ridiculous accusations that he, he threw at me, uh, on his website. And we talked about them one by one, what I believed and what I actually didn't believe, what I said and what I didn't say, and he ran after basically just

Speaker 1:          02:34:08       tapping them out mentally for three hours just over and over and over again. You're wrong here. You're wrong there. This is silly. This is dumb. This is poor thinking. He went and wrote this really distorted thing on his website. This is really bizarre account. I mean, he was very kind to me, said he was. I was nice and funny, but here's why. Thanks. I still promote dangerous pseudoscience, but if you look at the videos that that guy puts out himself, he's got this video on fracking and how safe fracking is and how not no need to worry about fracking. And he's got this really hilarious smug video on the reality of fracking or hydraulic fracturing or fracking fucks up environments permanently. All threads with. It's been over a thousand instances of poison wells in this country because of fracking documented, documented instances of poisoned wells. I mean, they fucked up huge parts of this country pretty much forever because of fracking. So what is fracking day like? How do they? Well, it's a very complicated process of getting a, getting this stuff out of the ground, getting oil and natural gas out of the ground, mostly oil right? And it involves water, hydraulic fracturing, and they pump water in and I'm not the guy to be describing is this his thing on fracking here?

Speaker 6:          02:35:26       Why Marvel and Fox blamed the fact that fracking was used in the area and investigation into this family.

Speaker 1:          02:35:33       First of all, your music makes me want to kill babies.

Speaker 6:          02:35:35       Discovered that their wells had been drilled directly into a shallow natural gas deposit. This is common. It's not a problem with the wells. Properly vented. There's wasn't so gas got into their water. How do we know it had nothing to do with fracking? Water wells range in depth from a few meters to a few hundred at the very deepest, but fracking takes place kilometers deeper. Past numerous layers of bedrock years of study have proven what geologists have always known. There's just too much distance of solid rock between the two regions for any seat, but just to take place.

Speaker 1:          02:36:11       Stopped at this camera right here. That's such total horse shit. He's just parroting the words of the people that have been paid by these companies that are making fucking trillions of dollars to say. I mean that's what he's doing. These, these piss-poor studies, these, these people that have been documented on all these various documentaries like there's. There's, there's the two ones on the gas land, one and gas land too, but then there's also people that have done interviews and showing how they can light their fucking water on fire now and showing how their, their wells are poisoned. People who have been really made deathly ill by drinking what they thought was filtered water, but it's not filtered enough because some of the chemicals from fracking got into the water, proven that those are the specific chemicals that are in their water that got there from fracking and this is. He's just one of those fucking guys. There was no nonsense. Guys, don't worry. The government says it's okay, we're fine, but even his tone that's such an affected tone. That's like a fake way of talking. He's talking like this, like reassuring you. That's such nonsense fucking talk,

Speaker 2:          02:37:18       you know, I don't know much about fracking but I can tell you just from reading his trying to criticize science, he's got a very topical understanding of it and you know, when I was reading some of his stuff, like I was just like, this guy shouldn't be doing this. Like, you know, it's very, very naive understanding and so if you're gonna try to criticize, criticize something and turn and say it's not true, then you really need to know what you're talking about or get some frequent experts that are really new.

Speaker 1:          02:37:44       He's got some real problems with this thinking and I think he knows it. He sent me an email asking me about psychedelics, asking me about psychedelics in mind. Expanding. I think he knows he's fucked up. I really do. He saw also indicted by the you mean he's going to jail? He's, he's, he's involved in an Ebay scam. Scam them from millions of dollars. I didn't want to talk about it on the podcast, but after you talk shit about me and go fuck himself, he, he's, he was involved in this Ebay scam where they were, uh, they were cookie stuffing, stuffing cookies. You, you'd go to use an application and I don't, I don't know the full details of it, but it, he's in real trouble. And you pleaded guilty and he's a felon.

Speaker 2:          02:38:21       She was asking you about psychedelics. It's, it's very

Speaker 1:          02:38:24       well. I think he wants to try to figure out what the fuck's wrong with his thinking. Well, I just, I really think that it has to do with growing up Mormon. I really think that there's, there's, it's not a small amount that it fucks your head up when you grow up in a fundamentalist mindset when you were told that there's a man in the sky that Joseph Smith told his disciples about and that there's golden tablets at the last work of Jesus and this guy found him when he was 14. I mean all the shit that you have to believe to be a mormon. This guy bought into that hook, line and sinker, and that's how he grew up. That's how he grew up as a child. That's how he grew up as a teenager. That's how we grew up as a man, until he refuted it and, and your thought process.

Speaker 2:          02:39:05       Now he just doesn't believe anything. It's like, okay, well, everything that I was told throughout my life is wrong. So then everything else,

Speaker 1:          02:39:12       if you just googled dangers of fracking, there is a tremendous amount of information out there about fracking, about what's bad, about fracking, about the dangers. And we had Peter Schiff on the podcast who's, uh, you know, economic genius, very smart guy, but also owns fracking companies. And he was talking about it and when I brought it up to him, he didn't deny the dangers of it. What he said was, look, those people got money and they got millions of dollars because of that. Like, that's a great thing for them. Like in his mind, millions of dollars is okay to poison places forever. I mean, it's, I'm no fracking expert. I don't claim to be a fracking expert, but if one fraction of what is said about fracking, the negative aspects of fracking is true. It's a tricky thing. It's a very tricky thing. Yes, we could use the natural resources.

Speaker 1:          02:40:00       Yes. You know, uh, it would be nice to not be dependent on foreign oil. However, if you really are destroying thousands of wells, if that's really is documented, if really people are getting sick from drinking water that's contaminated with a very chemicals that they use for fracking, you know, that doesn't seem like it's good. That seems like that's something that most people are not aware of. And when you find out who are the people that are, that are funding these studies that are saying it's safe and where's the money coming from? A lot of it's coming from these oil companies. A lot of it is coming from these oil companies and the reason why these, these, these laws are in place in the first place. A lot of it is because people have been greased, a lot of is people been paid off. They understand that there's a lot of money to be made in this and they've allowed the doors to be open for these companies to come in and fuck up giant parts of the country forever.

Speaker 1:          02:40:50       Not according to Brian Dawning, don't worry. Hydraulic fracturing takes place kilometers into the earth. Right. Sleep tight. Don't worry about Ebay. Poor bastard. Poor bastard. I liked him. He's not a bad guy too, but you know, he said after the podcast, he said he would remove me from his list. He said, you've convinced me. I'm going to remove you from my last. Then from just getting crushed by people online, the poor, poor guy got destroyed on twitter because people listened to the podcast. We're so frustrated by him and the ridiculous way he thinks and the ridiculous things that he was saying.

Speaker 2:          02:41:27       Yeah, just the same pod. It must have been the same one. I had only been online. Sorry. Okay. That was so infuriating. Yeah. Yeah. That's. You know, I, I, I haven't seen all your podcasts, but I can tell that you're. You don't seem to be a promoter of pseudoscience. You seem to be an inquisitive person that likes to critically think about things and you're also very open minded. So it's like, well, what if this is, you know, let's think about, let's think about how this could be working in. What if it is true? It's not, you know, there's, there's a difference between thinking like that and, and pseudoscience where you're just like, you know, you're just crazy and like you're thinking, oh, there's the. I don't think he can see the reference. Yeah, the differentiate between someone that's actually just inquisitive and open minded and doesn't see things as okay, it's either this or that and you know, maybe there's something that we don't understand and you know what, there is a lot that we don't understand.

Speaker 2:          02:42:20       Like it's even even for just back to nutrition, you know, like taking, eating a plate full of green vegetables, what we think we're getting vitaminK and folic acid and magnesium, but there's a whole bunch of crap in there. We don't know what it's doing. We don't know what's in there and what it's doing and how it's affecting, you know, you know, processes in our body and we do know that there's good stuff going on in there and things that we don't even understand. So yeah, there's a lot of stuff that we just, we can't explain yet. We're trying to. I'm not sure

Speaker 1:          02:42:49       a concern would look like a fool. So if something comes up and I go, where is that possible? Is that true? [inaudible] let's, let's think about if that's possible. There's a lot of people that are very concerned about looking like fools that won't go down those roads. They won't say something absolutely ridiculous, you know, like, do you think the CIA really did kill Kennedy? Let's think about it. You think it's possible for them to kill Kennedy? The, a lot of people that go, oh, come on now, look, Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. Case closed. We're done here. You know, they want to be that no nonsense guy. That doesn't look like a fool. But the problem is there's a lot of nonsense in the world and if you really look into things openminded, you find that there's some gray and everything in almost every subject. There's some fucking weirdness.

Speaker 2:          02:43:34       I agree 100 percent for Brian dunning. All I have to say to him is I'm hired some people that like know how to, you know, read science and critically analyze it. If you're going to call yourself a science writer for God's sake, you know?

Speaker 1:          02:43:50       Yeah. Well the people like that along with people like Dave Asprey, who got the information on the, uh, the study, the dietary study incorrect. There is a real problem with those guys because they're not a guy like me who's not a fucking expert in anything. Look, if you asked me questions about martial arts, if you ask me questions about standup comedy, I can give you the opinion of an expert. I am a true expert in those very small areas. That's it. When you talk to me about anything else, I'll go, I fucking read some shit online. I read a book. I'm not an expert, but when people start spouting shit out as fact, I'm learning on this podcast that there is a big responsibility that I'm learning how, how the, the pitfalls of having people spouting things as fact that aren't necessarily factual

Speaker 2:          02:44:36       and you know what? I know a lot about nutrition and science and there is a

Speaker 1:          02:44:40       hello, have a law that I do not know. Well, I love that you're honest about it. Know like when I asked you about amino acids in India, taking them without water, you're right away. I don't know, but that's great. That's how the world should be. The guys like Dave Asprey, you ask them, they come up with a fucking answer because they don't want to look stupid and that answer might be a wise was coffee bitter mycotoxins. Are you fucking sure? Where's your task that show Mycotoxins, make coffee bitter. You don't have anything man. You gotTa stop doing that. You've got to stop. You're confusing the fuck out of me. And then I parrot what you're saying. I confused the fuck out of a bunch of people and that happens a lot. Like I said,

Speaker 2:          02:45:15       you know, he, he also talks about the lectins and the beans and it's like and recall it as the same thing where it's like, you know, these, they have some good information, you know, these people have, there are some good things that they say, but there's also some information that's totally wrong and the problem is people think because they have one good piece of information that everything they say is right and it's not, you know, and that's where you get this parenting where it's like, well there's a meme now. It's like, I don't know who started it, but someone started it and it's not accurate. Right. They didn't dig deep enough. They don't understand enough of the science behind it. And so then you get everyone following this, this big following and it's like, you know, like how do you come in and say, okay look, this is how it's really happening. And that's kind of what I'm trying to do in some degree it's not easy and I'm doing it in my spare time because I'm also still doing research. So I'm like, on weekends I'm like writing articles and making videos instead of going out and the bay area, you know, but I freaking love doing it. So.

Speaker 1:          02:46:12       Well listen, I've really enjoyed this conversation. I think you've opened up a lot of people's eyes and you've educated a lot of people and provide a lot of information. Almost too much information is. I'm definitely seeing people writing down all these different things in googling all these different things that you've said, but I think we could have this conversation 100 times. I really do. And if you ever want to come on again, I would love to have that again and tell people what, you know, your videos, where can they find them

Speaker 2:          02:46:35       tube. So if you go to my page, found my fitness.com and really just kind of ski down the social media slopes, you know, I've got really there's three ways people can help me. One is by, by subscribing to my podcast or my itunes and my youtube channel to really help me keep going and also at found my fitness, my podcast, the name of the podcast. That's the name of my, that's my twitter name, that's the name of my podcast. I also have a patrion campaign they could help me with.

Um, and lastly is signing up for my newsletter. I know that's not that cool these days, but I actually put a lot of good information. My newsletter, I'm going to put it this link to this new study on, on the sauna that I was talking about that it's coming out in a couple of weeks. That's awesome. Yeah. So I would love to come back and talk about, you know, absolutely everything and this paper on Serotonin's coming out and a couple of weeks, actually six days. So look for that and I'll probably send you a link going. Okay,

Speaker 1:          02:47:42       send me anything. I'd be happy to tweet it. It's so important to me to have people like yourself that are actual experts with legitimate credentials that can separate and clear the fog on a lot of these issues and I'm, I'm, I'm fucking not tolerating this anymore. If someone comes in and they have all these clams, they don't have information to back up the clients. I'm just going to fucking keep.

Speaker 2:          02:48:03       Hit me up anytime we have a question. I will. I will dig into it. Like I'm going to look into some of the stuff you talked about today that I didn't know about. Beautiful.
