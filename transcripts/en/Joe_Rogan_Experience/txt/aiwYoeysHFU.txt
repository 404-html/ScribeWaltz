Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience. Oh yeah. Forgot to tell you this. What? So when I was, I was having some pretty good thoughts on this acid watching some different pants. The killers by the way, fucking killed it. Hmm. Um, so I've tried, you see stuff in like when you're out there on second dog, so truth, I call them universal truths where you just like, yes, that is real. That is right. 100%. And it's hard to bring that shit back into this realm, you know, to understand it and trying to get us kicked off youtube. It's passing car. So it's hard when you come back to be like, oh, I saw the truth of something and then it's like I, and you can't express it. And when people come back, when they're around you, they say something and you're like, what? And they're like, they realized that get frustrated. They're not saying it right. And then it's slowly going away. Yeah. So when I was there in that place, sometimes I try to remember like when you get back say this to this person, so that state told me to tell you the M and m is one of the realest MCS.

Speaker 1:          01:06          I'm not going to argue with it. I don't know what exactly but it was like does that could be a funny bit dude. There's a funny bit in there like about how like some things are just in the moment. They seem so profound and then I'd be like, what the fuck is wrong with me? And My name was one of the real estate MCS. Why would agree with that? Oh, so he's very, very real. It seems fairly

Speaker 2:          01:31          brill and leary almost certainly played a role, but I think it's slightly ironic that he's a journalist and didn't really go that deep into the role that journalists played in all of this, which was humongous. You know, journalists are sculptors of public opinion and it became the standard way of reporting on any of these things to say that they're bad, to sensationalize it and to not have any consideration for what that would do. Because anytime a journalist writes him scare story, they can really mess with drug policy in a serious way. It might seem like nothing like, oh, there's a bunch of people in Brooklyn and they overdosed on some obscure synthetic cannabinoid amb food Bendeka who cares about amb food? Banika no big deal. Say that it turns people into zombies and if it gets thrown into schedule one, who cares? Not a big deal.

Speaker 2:          02:20          Well, that's a very short sighted way of thinking about all of this because that's exactly what happened with psychedelics and then we're not learning from the mistakes of the past that just because something, it's fun to sensationalize and talk about how dangerous it is at this moment. It doesn't mean that 10 years from now we're going to recognize that it has serious therapeutic potential and we made a big mistake outlawing it. And I think a lot of that also comes from this sort of us versus them mentality that people have where it's cannabis is good. Synthetic cannabinoids are bad. Well, synthetic cannabinoids don't have to be bad for cannabis to be good. Cannabis can be good without something else being bad to counter balance. You don't need to hate something to justify your love of cannabis. And this whole hatred of synthetic cannabinoids I think is totally misdirected because these are products of prohibition that most people wouldn't even want to use in the first place.

Speaker 2:          03:12          And when they do use them, they don't know what they're taking. They don't know what dose they're consuming. And so of course they're having bad experiences that would happen with almost any drug. Caffeine included if people just consumed enormous unmeasured doses without having any idea what they were getting into. And so they're thrown into schedule one. What happens if 30 years from now, once the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids is being really seriously explored, we find out that that Ambi [inaudible] that everyone was saying turn homeless people into zombies in Brooklyn in 2017 turns out to activate a certain subtype of the CB one receptor that's especially useful for Parkinson's disease or something like that. Then we're going to regret having done that. So I think people have to be very careful. Anytime you say anything negative about a drug, you have to be very, very careful because the implications can be enormous. I think that the best stance and all of this is to not speak ill of drug,

Speaker 3:          04:05          any drug. The drugs have breakthrough drug enthusiasm. But also if you really think about the fact that we are in a world where people have to go to work to do a job, that by the way, man, if there is a dude you need to get on this podcast and there's a book that you would love, David Graber wrote this book called Bullshit Jobs. This guy is a fucking genius man. And this book, bullshit jobs breaks down the phenomena of, uh, how many, many people are working in jobs that don't do anything for the world or the company they're working for. And it's not like this judgmental thing where he's like, yeah, that's a bullshit job. You're a blah, blah, blah. He's one of the, he's like an anthropologist. So he's very precise. But one of the qualifications for your job to be a bullshit job is you know, that it's really kind of a worthless job.

Speaker 3:          04:59          It's not really doing anything. And like the companies have gotten so fucking big that uh, they, they end up having like departments or people running departments or extra employees that don't really need to be there at all and they have to pretend to be to work. That's what he writes about. He writes it, if you really want to torture a person, uh, not only give them like the job of like, you know, pouring a glass of water and an empty glass and pouring it back, but then add to it, did they have to deceive their boss into thinking that they're like doing an important job or they lose their job. So these not only are these, like some corporations and companies scanning your pis to see if you're taking a substance that is allowing you to connect with home what you actually are. They are demanding that you spend many hours a day lying to them, that you're doing work that you're not doing.

Speaker 3:          06:05          Like, if you're fucking efficient, you know, and this is another thing I graybar writes about, forgive me David Graver. If in any way I'd misconstrue this, I read your writings stoned, but the, and, but the, the, um, the, the other fucking element to it that is absolutely atrocious and fucking horrible is that, uh, these substances are connecting is to home. They don't want us to be in those states and they're asking us to fucking lie all day. And you know what psychedelic means? The etymology of psychedelic. No, it means mind manifesting or sole manifesting, right? So a psychedelic connects us potentially with the truth, what we are, our identity, right? And these companies, they're asking us to lie, to be the opposite of our identities, to wear weird a suit or, or some kind of dress code. And to sit in a desk where, because you're efficient, you get your job done in 45 minutes and for the next six hours you got to sit and type in, pretend that you're working.

Speaker 4:          07:17          It was an ongoing maneuver of mine. We'd have these hippie writers come in to take notes and I'd say, yeah, I played this fender stratocaster as I hold up my Gibson Birdland, which was known for, and they'd write down, he played in a Gibson a stratocaster. There's no such thing as the gifts reddick guest. So I was having fun with dirt bag anti journalists. So now I'm invited to high times magazine and I was hardcore anti-drug. So I go in and this guy is and here's typically, uh, so uh, tell me about a GSI amboy Dukes, what is it? Like a band? And I went, yeah, it's like a band. So it's almost exactly like a band kind of a question. Is this, how did this all started still draft Sony? How we started talking about when I'm with the MC five and the stooges and we would party and I go, yeah man, I was snorting something.

Speaker 4:          08:14          I don't know what it was, man, I just got higher than a kite. And he goes, wow, you think I might've been a crystal meth? And I mean, yeah, that's what they called it. I never snorted crystal meth and ups and shit just went nuts. And I, we went into the war thing and I go, I don't know anything about war. I'm a, I'm a guitar player. But I went down from my draft physical and when I went into the booth to give my urine sample, I made sure I ate Mexican food all week. So instead of pissing in the Urine Cup, I took a big dump in it was green and went all over the place and the guy went, wow. He really, yeah, really. And so I made up the story for High Times magazine, you know, the great magazine of good information and uh, embed. It turned out that my drummer, Kj night, God bless him, he, Jack, she admitted this in and testified that that's what he did.

Speaker 4:          09:04          We thought it was the funniest thing in the world. We're teenagers and this guy went into the draft physical, just an absolute near death, lumpy shit to get out of the draft. And we thought it was funnier and hell. We weren't paying attention to important things in life. And so the, the Ted Hating liberal press started quoting the high times magazine and quoting an ex girlfriend who claimed that I adopted her, did her, I adopted my girlfriend. If you read that one, I did read that one. I forgot about it. So this kind of stuff, I was like, you adopted her so you could take her on tour with Ya know, so I could fucker, that's what the story was. But that's Ab. Absolutely. I don't think that's how it works. That's not, I don't think it makes it easier to talk than once you adopt them.

Speaker 4:          09:53          I didn't adopt anybody. I never shit my pants since I was eight months old. Um, I've never been with an underage girl since I was under age. I'm not a racist. And what else do they say? Oh, and they seem that they claimed that I made Courtney love blow me when she was 12. I think she claimed that I, yeah, I never met Courtney love. You can tell I don't have a rash. Um, you just gotta be kidding me. They just make this shit up because they know I'm so good at bringing my basic conservative agenda forward that they have to go full, solid Lynskey and lie and lie and lie. And if you go to Wikipedia to find out about Ted Nugent, they will repeat these lies. They're lies. Every one of those things. Every one of those things. If I had done and I go, yeah, it was awesome, but I didn't do any of those things.

Speaker 4:          10:48          Anyone can edit wikipedia, you know that right in the balls. Very strange that she might have edited it yet. So, so I'm glad we got that. Oh, this thing is just persisted forever. Obviously it stuck in your crop because you wanted to bring it up, but the very end, it doesn't stick in my crotch. Just, it's a fascinating example of the dishonesty and the anti journalism agenda driven, um, anti American anti Ted Anti Second Amendment, anti freedom buffoonery the exist. I think it makes for an interesting podcast exchange. I think so. It's not in my craw. It's not even in my universe, but I notice it. It's hysterical. Yeah.
