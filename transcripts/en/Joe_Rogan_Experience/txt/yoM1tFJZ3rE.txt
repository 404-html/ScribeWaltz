Speaker 1:          00:00:00       I get the comedy store, never cashed the checks. So how'd you get into comedy? We are alive. We'll answer bad childhood. Everybody's freelance. If you didn't get into that for that reason, you probably have a shitty act. Yeah. That is so true. Because it lets you, it lets you weren't seen as a child or heard as a child and have this insatiable need to be seen and heard and understood. It's definitely a deficit. You can't be funny. Dude. What the fuck were you doing in Vietnam? Because this is one of the reasons I didn't want to talk to you about this before that I didn't want to see you before this. I just wanted to get you in and I'm glad we didn't talk about it before, but I went to your instagram page and I saw these pictures of you working with these children that have cleft palates and I saw these photos of you in Vietnam. So tell me what are you doing?

Speaker 2:          00:00:43       Um, so there's this charity called Operation Smile and I'm usually working in animal charities because people I think are usually the problem. And I had been helping people just seems to make more proliferate and uh, and in terms of charity stuff, like I think that just why I started wanting to get more involved as like, I'm going to be perfectly honest, I started not liking the person that I was. I started realizing I was the person who was like, God traffic. It's like crazy today. Like, oh my God, starbucks is out of soy milk with the puck. Like I was just like, whoa.

Speaker 1:          00:01:20       That is jus. What did, what, what made you feel like you were going to a place that you didn't like or becoming a person in life?

Speaker 2:          00:01:27       I think it's like, um, you know, doing like working with animals and like, you know, going to sort of, um, parts of town that I wouldn't normally go to to rescue animals and dogs. You start going like, oh, there's a real world outside this. Truman show that we live in of the fake sets and the fake this and the fake people and the fake, you know, makeup and the fake close every. And I was just like, oh, like that. I live in a fun house, you know, sometimes when you're in this business, I mean, stand up keeps me, you know, a real person because TV shows that get you. I think it's TV shows, I think it's writing fake scripts about fake people and fake lots and fake houses and you know, fake edit bays. And uh, I just was like really? I'm concerned about and knowing, you know, way more than I do, but then what I do know about neurology is that our brains acclimate to whatever environment we're in.

Speaker 2:          00:02:21       And I was like, I'm in this environment all the time. My brain is just going to start acclimating accordingly. Right. So it's like, you know, I find it a little ways, like, you know, if I, uh, if I have a small purse, I only need a small purse. If I were a big purse, all of a sudden I filled it up with shit, you know, it's like you kind of acclimate to what you have a. and so I was like, um, yeah, I don't, I don't like the things that come out of my mouth. I don't like my inner monologue. I don't like the fact that I get annoyed when, uh, you know, my uber is, you know, not on fucking time. Like I just, I was like, so I kind of wanted to get some perspective and like really get out there and not just like giving money for my own selfish, like guilt, like I'm just going to give money.

Speaker 2:          00:03:01       And so I went to Vietnam for two weeks and did this. Um, I went to Tokyo for a couple of days before then, which was actually really interesting. Uh, and uh, when I got to, you know, wash the surgeries and uh, it was also cool because I don't know if you are at this ever went through this, but um, I think I got sick of myself. Like I just kind of was like, I'm sick of my voice. I'm sick of my making jokes. I'm sick of being funny. I'm sick of like. And uh, there's something about being around people that don't speak English, that kind of strips you of your persona, you know, of your, all the things that you. Just because some. I mean, I, I just, I don't want to go through life like a sleep walking Zombie who's just like doing a bad impression on myself every day because it's so easy to do and I find, I felt like life was a little bit groundhog day bud, get up, workout jokes, jokes, jokes, jokes, bits, bits, bits, you know, insecure, insecure, you know, and I got a little bit sick of that rhythm and I was like, there's gotta be something more deeper and uh, you know, were seekers and I was like thinking about my next special and the next thing I'm going to write.

Speaker 2:          00:04:11       And I was like, I don't want to just. And I felt like my brain was, had this, there was like patterns and rhythms that I was like, I keep going to the same place for creatively. And I was like, I want to go to a different place entirely. So I got to like challenge my brain and throw some new shit at it. Um, and being around people that don't speak English is really, first of all have no idea who you are, which is another experience when you're used to people knowing who you are and having expectations of you and thinking you're going to be funny or you know, when you're known, all of a sudden you have the power whether you wanted or not in a room, you know, you walk into a room and you have the power whether you're interested in having it or not, you just do, right?

Speaker 2:          00:04:51       Joe Rogan walks in, everyone's like, be cool and everyone's trying to impress you. Everybody changes, right? So you never get to see people's authentic self because you inherently affect them with your presence. You know, there's some, I can't remember the, a term in science where it's impossible to measure the thing because the measuring tool affects the amount. Is that. Yeah, exactly. So you never know how people really are because your presence actually affects them. But if they've never heard of you, which in Vietnam known for me, not a lot of fans over there. And, uh, so you're just like, you know, you can't rely on any of that shit that we've become used to relying on. Um, and talking to people that don't speak English, all of a sudden you're like, oh, I can't use all my goto strategies, charm, manipulation, jokes, like no one cares. Um, and so it was really pretty, pretty cool. Um, Vietnam in general, we'll talk about, I'm sure you have your thoughts on Asia. I'm mine, I think are kind of probably going to be polarizing and get me in trouble because I think it's a fucking mess over there.

Speaker 2:          00:05:57       But there's also, I think that when, you know, I mean, you have kids, you have more of a insight into what's real and what's not. Like. I also noticed that when, um, both of my parents had strokes, which was awful obviously, but I liked the person I became after it happened. Like I was like, all of a sudden when something tragic happens to you, things become clear. Your priorities become clear. If someone asks you to go to lodge that you don't want to hang out with, you said, no, you're not like, sure. I guess I'll switch. Like you're just. Everything becomes very black and white. Do I want to do this? Do I not? Is this an effective use of my time? It's just not. Um, so I was like, Oh, if I just exposed myself to a little bit more, not tragedy, but maybe you know, um, and stop hanging out with a bunch of people with fake problems and hang out and surround myself with real problems. Then maybe I'll stop thinking I have a bunch of problems I don't really have.

Speaker 3:          00:06:48       I always love talking to you because you're probably one of the most ruthlessly introspective people I know. Really? Yeah. Yeah. You don't, you don't think you are, you don't see, you're pretty brutally introspective. I just, I thank you.

Speaker 2:          00:07:02       I just, um, I don't want to be as somby. I don't. Most people are just sleepwalking through life and uh, that does not happen.

Speaker 3:          00:07:10       Yes ma'am. Do you have, you had very many psychedelic experiences. You know, what I have

Speaker 2:          00:07:14       event and I was going to do Iowasca last year, but I had been on antidepressants and yeah, and I only went on them. It's such a bummer and I'm actually want to talk about this in my next special because they were, they were given to me because I was having trouble sleeping. I had insomnia, which I recently learned about how insomnia it sort of came about and it's actually really important. Um, and I wish that there were doctors out there who studied shit like that, like insomnia. Usually people are insomniacs fucking thousands of years ago, people in the tribes, like tribal life before streetlights and alarm systems. There were people who were responsible for staying up all. Everybody else slept. They were like, they called the night watchers basically. And nightwatch would breed with night watchers and s essentially.

Speaker 3:          00:07:58       So you're a nightwatchman. I could be, that could be my. Because you know, there's some people who are like, I just can't fall asleep till three in the morning. I know who never says that. Who Farmers was never say that actually fucking work true. Do to dig holes all day today. I know the most I'd employed people. They're like, oh, I cannot sleep. It's again because you haven't done shit. Fucking well. Yeah. You have three kids, right?

Speaker 2:          00:08:22       I feel like my insomnia is going to go write something there. I feel like as soon as I have kids or something, mine's off.

Speaker 3:          00:08:26       It'll probably still stay there. Really? Oh, I guess I'll be a mother so I'll never sleep the. That's an issue, but it's also a mental loop thing. Like if you go to bed and you have a mental loop, like, oh, I gotta get this. I gotTa fucking get my shit together. I really have to do this. I really got to start this diet and really going to start a journal. There's a book that I need to write. I know I need to write it. I need to fucking start. Should I get out of bed right now and start writing it and then that loop will fuck with you and keep you up. Especially someone like you who's so hyper ambitious, you always have like 15 irons in the fire

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       and you've got a fucking fireplace, bellows. You're stoking and you're on the phone at the same time. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll do that. We'll definitely do that. We've almost got like too many points of focus where I imagine that your brain getting down to a neutral point, it probably has a very difficult time. Yeah, and I've also done a couple things, but also our brains are not designed to see the amount of light that we see. Like we're like the screens and our phones, like our brain produces cortisol. When they see it, it's like, wake up. Our brain thinks our phone is the sun basically. Wake up. Have you seen the new feature on iphones were turns it down at 10:00 PM? You could set it. No, but mine is now in black and white. Oh Shit. Just going back to go back to the phone.

Speaker 1:          00:09:43       Black and white fucking typewriter. If someone sends you a picture, then it's, you know, it's gonna be very hard to see. How did you give her your phone? I've turned a black and white because you do that. I didn't even know that was a of settings. Yeah, because the colors in your phone, a trigger, a bunch of chemicals to be released in your brain that actually activate you and entered entered. So ironic. You have a flower as your backdrop. Flower, black and white. See what the fuck George O'keeffe. I mean our big. Yeah. That. Yeah, that's a really. That's an octopus vagina actually that flower. But yeah, I'm super into a like, you know, just if you understand how the brain works, you can usually hack, get a little bit. So it's like when you look at your phone. So my phone, I actually, I used to be so addicted to it.

Speaker 1:          00:10:30       Now I just have no interest in it because it's black and white. It's just like, it's not giving me the dopamine and the chemicals that you know. Really? Yeah. Color. What color? Turning your phone black and white makes it less attractive to you? Less addictive. Whoa. Yes, because I'm like phone, phone, and a lot of it is just the color, so it's just like, oh, cortisol. Adrenaline read produces adrenaline and cortisol, dopamine, and then I'm just like, no. I'm just like, ugh. It's so. What is the setting? How have you changed? You go to. I'll tell you. Hold on. I'll never do it. By the way. Why not try it? Try it for a day because I'll have a little thing called discipline didn't see. I just want to have sex with that now. I can't do it. Can't do it. Listen, it's not easy and I've learned how to do it.

Speaker 1:          00:11:15       I've learned how to do it so. But I've rules that might not be your. What gives you dope? Me. Oh No, it is. No, look, I could sit down there. I get up in the morning and take a shit and I'll look at that thing for fucking three hours. What are you looking at? Reading? I'm reading articles that I don't need to read. I'm fucking just becomes like a cancer, but what I do now is if I do it, I look at the important stuff. I'll go over, do I have any work emails that are pertinent to check my work? Email? Yeah. There's nothing to deal with. Do I have any text messages that are other I need to deal with? Nothing to deal with. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:11:53       Shut it off, put it away,

Speaker 2:          00:11:55       walk away. You and I though might have a different idea of what I need to deal with them, but I doubt I sometimes, you know, get sucked into stuff that's completely unnecessary and frivolous. That's also an addiction. I'm texting about a fucking baby shower that I'm not even going to and I'm just like, what am I doing? You know, I'm difficult to get ahold of your, but you're very self contained. I'm a little more and I'm in recovery. We talked about it for codependent, so I sometimes struggle with the discomfort or perceived as comfort of others, so I feel like I need to take care of people's feelings sometimes. So it's harder a caretaker and a lot of ways. That's why you love dogs, dogs and dogs. Only the voiceless. Only people. Only like people that are can't help themselves. If you can help yourself and you didn't, that's not my problem.

Speaker 3:          00:12:39       I've learned over the years that I only have a certain amount of, not just time, but a certain amount of focus and that the less focused I give two things that I'm not really interested in, the more focused I'll have for things that I am interested in. Yeah. It's like a real issue with my manager because I just fucking vanish for days. I don't answer phone calls.

Speaker 2:          00:12:59       Jamie, I just got the same thing. I had the same thing just happened with a manager who hadn't heard from me because I went to Vietnam and I got back and I was just like. I recently learned that when someone calls or texts you don't have to respond. Like I, you know, I think we get in this obligatory sort of thing. We have to respond to everything and it was actually interesting going to Japan because that culture is, so. I'm using this word probably a inappropriately, but for lack of a better word, codependent, it's so like having to take care of everybody's feelings. Like I was talking to this guy on a plane. There's so much respect for other people's feelings and status. I went, I'm on the plane on the way over. I sat next to the super interesting guy who creates a tools for animators, like I know like the stuff that makes cartoons, like I, I can't even, I don't even have the vernacular to explain it.

Speaker 2:          00:13:50       Um, but he said it's really hard to do focus groups in Japan, you know, focus groups is when you go around and say, is this working? Is this not working? Right? Because no one will respond until an elder response and everyone just agrees with the elder. You're not allowed to disagree with someone older than you. Uh, which was, uh, there was an article about the, um, a lot of the, I think it was a couple Malaysian airline flights that went down. They say it was pilot error because the copilot was afraid to disagree with the pilot. The pilot was wrong, but because of the inherent respect for your elders thing, he couldn't say like, dude, we're going to crash if you can do that. And the plane went down. So it's so interesting. And I came back and I was like, Oh God, at least I'm not. And I mean in, I mean I think I was a little bit horrified, horrified, not a good word, the right word. Saddened by this culture of like, shame over there. We have it in different ways, but it's like if you disgrace your family, you just jump off a building. I mean it's just. And

Speaker 4:          00:14:52       there's so many people were jumping in front of trains that the only way they could get them to stop jumping in front of trains when they shame their family was saying if people jump in front of trains, we're going to bill your family for the cleanup. So that got them to stop because they were like, well, why don't my family to have to get this bill? Because that will disgrace them even more. So they had to use their shame against them as a way to get them to stop committing suicide. I mean, apple in China, apple had to put nets around the building. So many people were jumping off it. Well that's a real issue in and unto itself because Apple's paying these people and they're living in this building, paying dog shit. I mean, they don't have these factories over in China because it's an awesome place to build phones.

Speaker 4:          00:15:43       They have these factories over there because they could pay people virtually nothing and have them work all day. China, I've been to China before just in general, like, and I'm, and I want to come from a judging place because we obviously have our problems in the states, but uh, it was just a really. I feel like when I went over there and was like, Gosh, you're just going to love it. Like everyone's, like, India is amazing. It's like it's really poor and people die of dysentery and yeah. And there's, you know, I'm a baby girls or have their head smashed on rocks because of the dowery system. I mean it's like there's, you know, I feel like there's this. Yeah, there's a documentary on I guess itunes. It's about infanticide in China and India because the dowery system. So basically to have a child is a fortune.

Speaker 4:          00:16:35       I've had time, sorry to have a female because you have to pay someone to marry her. She can't work at your dad's family. And she's basically just like a financial drain, um, which is just terrifying. So that goes on in China. Still a terrifies me is that that's probably an ancient way of thinking and behaving. So like we look at today and we look at this world that we live in today and obviously we have a lot of issues with equality and we have a lot of issues with racism. We have a lot of issues with homophobia, but whatever issues we have are nothing compared to the, the echoes of our past. And when you look at something like that and when you know, there are hate crimes, that's an individual person against an individual person that's not like a socially accepted thing. Smaller the Nazi, I'm not endorsing hate crimes, but if you know someone, a beats up a gay guy, most people think it was bad that he did that and they go to jail. But it's one person who's fucked up, not entire country. That's like, yeah, that was a good idea. The last echoes, the last reverberations that our way is better. I'm not saying you guys have to become America, but it was just a little bit like, oh, this is like, well, I like fact that they're not America.

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       I liked it. There's all these different cultures because I think it's fascinating that there's different parts of the world where people have figured out a different way to behave and they follow this different pattern. They've carved this groove and all the young people follow into this groove, give or take, and I think that's amazing. I mean when you look at different parts of the world and you experienced their culture or you look at how they're behaving and how they dress and how they speak and how they live their lives and their traditions. It is absolutely fascinating. These patterns of repeatable behavior to repeating, repeating patterns that exists all over the world and that they're so different. They're different in Thailand and then they are in Germany. Totally different parts of the world are associated with like having more humor or less, more or more, you know, more discipline or more artistic freedom. It's, it's,

Speaker 2:          00:18:35       it's so and it's. And then, you know, I mean I always forget how young of a country we are. I mean we are a minute old compared to a lot of these countries do you now, so this is, they have thousands of years of history that we don't have and, but it's like how can you hold on to the really cool traditions and patterns and then release the more backwards once and evolve and grow, you know, it's like, you know, it's just wild. I mean in Vietnam and it from Vietnam is so beautiful you're going to love it. And I was like, yeah, it's definitely beautiful. But I see poverty and air that no one can breathe. Everyone's wearing masks because they can't inhale. There's no emissions regulations. Everyone's on. Like, I was like, oh right, white trust fund. Kids are like Vietnam, beautiful. And they say because they can come back to, you know, Williamsburg,

Speaker 3:          00:19:25       Brooklyn or whatever. That's the thing that why people love talking about Brown people being amazing.

Speaker 2:          00:19:29       It's like look like you're not a better person because you think Vietnam is amazing. Me Just admit that it's, it's in. We need to. I mean, I know we, we fucked it up a lot of, it's our fault of what we did in the seventies, but it was like, it was, um, gave me a lot of anxiety, you know, because it was like, I mean, it was just like the hospitals. I mean, we were in a hospital and you know, we needed four of this machine that puts babies to sleep. Pediatric anesthesia is very different than regular anesthesia and it's essentially bringing people to the brink of death and then bringing them back. It's like incredibly fascinating a job. And they had one of the machines that they need the pediatric anesthesiologist, like we need four and they're like, we don't have, we just don't have them in this country.

Speaker 2:          00:20:17       We just can't do surgery on babies. It's just not in our purview. It's not own our, you know, so. So back to, to the, you know, the kids come in with cleft palates and cleft lips, which the baby is essentially, they have trouble breastfeeding. It's um, and cleft palates just, you know, just kind of this opening here in a separation as a malnutrition in the womb. It's, yep, exposure to genetics, uh, exposure to pollution. I'm sure all that napalm we dropped in the seventies didn't really help. Uh, but yeah, and in America it still happens, but it's handled right away. It's handled. It comes out three months later. It's fixed, no big deal over there. Sometimes it's never fixed. And when you see adults, you see men that are 50 come in with giant, giant cleft lips and palates and they've. And it's even worse in third world countries, especially African countries because there's such a stigma attached to it.

Speaker 2:          00:21:12       Not only is it, you know, in our brains to go, like he's different than me and ostracized or stigmatized someone, but I'm a lot of more religious countries. Think you're the devil or your, you know, you can't get a job. You're completely sequestered. You're thrown out of your family. And you know, and I think, and this is gonna sound Super Corny. Um, but I guess for me, I, I connected so much to maybe it's because we're comedians. I was like, look, life, if you. It's one thing to grow up in a third world country. It's another thing to deal with poverty and stress, but if you can't smile like the basic, the only real medicine we have, you know, everybody has universal medicine of like laughing and smiling. That's how we connect to people. It's, I mean, that's fucked. Like that was frustrating and uh, it's so easy to fix. That's the other thing that's frustrating is it takes like 30 minutes. You're Joaquin Phoenix. Look at Joaquin Phoenix

Speaker 4:          00:22:11       it. Yeah. He has a cleft lip. Think Stacy Keach. Isn't it weird that Joaquin Phoenix got it mean he's like a

Speaker 2:          00:22:19       be genetic. I mean, yeah, but also America has its history was fucked up. Shit, you know. Um, you know, we're by no means squeaky clean. I mean, we're exposed to a lot of.

Speaker 4:          00:22:31       We are the exact Mirka Mirka. Um, uh, you'll like this. Well, we talked, we talked about this last time, just sort of like how we essentially always had to drink alcohol when before we had pottable water, people were just, you know, what people drank wine and of those flats they carried around to keep from getting travelers disease for water. That's what he would call it. Yeah, so it's completely, um, so yeah, what people were such assholes who were just hammering, everyone was hammered. I mean actually when you think about it, it's a miracle that someone. I mean Ford built a car, like it's like as if you were sober, you got to be like Rockefeller. Like I feel like the couple people who were sober just basically became like the biggest sober people who drink coffee. It literally took over the world, uh, because I mean everybody was shit faced. Um, but yeah, so it's crazy. I mean, have you ever seen a surgery? I love it. I've never been in the room, have had a bunch of surgeries, but I've never been in the room. I've had one, two, three, two, three joints. Yeah, mostly. Mostly joints. My nose were constructed. I have had

Speaker 5:          00:23:46       my knees done. Thank you. What was in it was internal, more like, I would never know. Externals so fucked up. It's all broken up in here. It's like there's all these sharp edges underneath. His skin would break open pretty easy because is it cartilage on the end and then bone up here. This is all cartilage, this stuff is all pretty much intact, but the inside of my nose that was all smashed and so it was all closed off. I didn't have any, any breathing out of my nose. No till I was 39 and you're like, yeah, my whole life. I couldn't be that in my nose. No bullshit. I fell down a flight of stairs when I was five and I broke my nose pretty bad when I was five. A cement flight of stairs, a smash my nose and get you an operation smile. Well, it wasn't just my parents just like, ah, yeah, he's alive. I'm alone. Like there was Dr Tripp's. I broke my arm. My Mother didn't believe me. I had to lift it up and it was like up and down. It was so broken and then she's like, break dancing. It's just, you know, back then it was just a different world. Like people were basically like monkeys, you know? My parents were like, monkeys, they're like, monkey have the Internet. Don't touch that. Don't touch that. Don't understand things now.

Speaker 2:          00:24:55       Yeah. But I think there's a little bit of a pendulum swing to the other way of helicopter parents. You. There was um, I was reading this thing about how this designer who's making more dangerous jungle gyms for kids because they've gotten too safe.

Speaker 5:          00:25:09       So the daughter broke her arm of jungle gym. Yeah. You should call this person. They're not, they're not safe. Like jungle gyms are just more challenging or something like, I don't, I don't remember. Like it was something about real problem with jungle gyms is you need to understand what your capabilities are and the only way to find that out as to fall. You're falling on these metal bars. You could fucking die. Like kids that break their arm easily. Kids don't die all the time. Or they do know they do. Kids die all the time. When you have kids, you sort of pay attention to that kind of shit and you realize like, oh, kids fall on their head and die. Like it happens all the time. If you're not paying attention and the kids get, they don't understand boundaries and limitations and physical as a parent because I'm obsessed with this because I'm already like, I'm not too close to having a

Speaker 2:          00:26:02       child. I froze my eggs. So if anyone wants to send some sperm, Jamie, now that you're getting, now that I'm, now that I'm learning about your, that's why I'm asking where are you from? Okay. Where are you from? Slovenia. Indiana will come in a cup for it. I'm really just trying to ascertain everyone's like DNA and how strong it is. But uh, is that um, I'm reading. I just read a book called the continuum concept, which is like a parenting saying about like babies. They can be held by anyone. It doesn't have to be their mom necessarily, but maybe we should always just be being held and sort of were designed to men and women kind of weren't supposed to live together like we're supposed to kind of fuck. And then you go off and then all the women lived together and help raise all the kids.

Speaker 2:          00:26:42       Um, so uh, uh, so there was something interesting in that because I'm the first three years a childhood's a, I'm sorry, a child's ability to believe in their own faculties essentially to trust other people and to feel like they're are heard and seen. Depends on how much eye contact and physical touch they get. Wow. Yeah. Cause basically touching is going like you, I see you, you're here, you know, and the less touch that eye contact they get, the more invisible they feel and the date more dangerous they feel the world is for them. Oh yeah. And there's this great. You'll love this. I'm John Bowlby's theory of attachment. Like when babies crawl, it's the same as for noble apes is they'll crawl a foot and then the look back and see if dad still looking at me. He is, I'm going to call another foot. He's still there, right?

Speaker 2:          00:27:27       Babies turn around and check in and then if on the fourth foot I turn around in, data is looking at his phone, I go, that's as far as I can go. And then it's dangerous after four feet, that's as far as I'll go where he'll still be there for me. So then we also are sort of world in comfort zone is designed based on when your child loses your eye contact. So I've just been sort of learning about that, especially in lieu of like cell phones being the new alcoholism for kids. I feel like parents

Speaker 1:          00:27:55       just on their phone while their kids are on the playground. Yeah, it's, it's crazy. It's, it's amazing how many people just don't pay attention to anything but their phone. I mean I see it constantly and I see it when people are by themselves. I see it when people with their families. I see when people with their friends. How many times have you gone to a restaurant? You see a table full of people and everyone's on their phone and no one's talking to the people right in front of them.

Speaker 2:          00:28:16       Did have you done like colleges recently?

Speaker 1:          00:28:19       I stopped. I stopped. I stopped more than a decade ago. Wow. I stopped. Uh, I think I did. University of Miami was the last one I did. I did with Joey Diaz, I think the coconut Grove Improv. Just. Yeah. Oh, thank God they closed because there were so many fights breaking out. It was so bad. I literally told them that I would never work. Here again. I go, you people are so dominant over work here again. And they were laughing. I got you laughing. I go, I'm serious. This is the dumbest fucking audience in the country. I watched a guy do cocaine. I was opening for like Steve Byrne or some like Craig's shoemaker, like someone, someone was opening for like 10 years ago and someone was doing cocaine on the table while I was on the call. I believe it will they. What happened with that place is they started giving away free tickets and when you give away seconds. Yep. Fuck yourself. Always, always. Those are bad, but you paper the room, you get terrible audiences. So

Speaker 2:          00:29:16       for awhile I was trying to give free tickets to people who couldn't afford them, so I'd always say my comps, like I have 10 comps in like the middle of nowhere. This actually happened in La Jolla and I would tweet out like, hey, so if you can't afford to come to the show, send me an email telling me why and I'll get you tickets and I would check it myself, you know, the Whitney Whitney, some email and one time this guy emails me just a testament to exactly, you know, give an inch, take a mile and emails me and gives

Speaker 4:          00:29:42       me this long story. He's a vet, you know, he's in a wheelchair, he can't drive down, he's going to have to get a cab and he can't afford to come. And the, you know, the health insurance that health insurance is a joke and I'll all this whole thing. I was like such a no brainer. I was like, Yep, you got it. Two tickets can't wait. And literally he started the email with like, this probably isn't even you. So Whitney's assistant like, you know, no problem and I'm such a big fan and Dah, Dah, Dah. All right, back to tickets. All set. Don't hear back from him at all. I'm not checking it again. Right before the show, I'm looking through my emails. It's 7:45. The show's at eight. I can email back from him. Hey Babe. Hey Babe, I'm running a little late. I'm running a little late and where do I park? It went from like Ajit, like total, like all and like respect and adulation. You're probably not even going to check this and like I'm sure this will never have to. Like I became his assistant.

Speaker 3:          00:30:40       It's a microcosm of a relationship. He was courting you.

Speaker 4:          00:30:43       Then he got me and like went from literally and then I was like, oh, okay. You know, do you need me to come out and meet you in the dynamic? Totally switched. It's like as soon as you give someone something for free, they stop respecting it.

Speaker 3:          00:30:58       Well, you have, it's, it's hard when you're communicating with someone just through email because you have to sort of ascertain, is this person crazy? Is this person Super Nice Person? Completely delusional. Is this email going to be received

Speaker 4:          00:31:15       in the way that I intended it? Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:31:16       Is it gonna? Be like, Hey, nice talking to you. Glad you liked the show. Appreciate it. Good though. So what do you. Oh, that's cool. You do that. That's interesting. Well, Hey, nice talking to you. Is it going to be just like, oh, I had a cool conversation with a guy, or is it going to be open up the door to a wacky person now? The wacky person as Whitney Cummings. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:31:34       Oh, he still emails all the time. Hey, let me know next time you're in town. I mean, it's like. And he behaves as if I'm doing him a favor. I also had a great, um, a Heckler, a guy that I got front row seats and like paid for everything. Started heckling. It's always the people you come tickets for. This isn't La Jolla lawyers always, you know, it's very sketchy. It's such scheduled. There's no fucking. All the security guards are open to anyone. Bless their hearts. They're stoned out of their fucking minds. Like, I mean, it's just, it's so unsafe. It's. And there's a lot of tension down there. I don't know if it's because there's the navy's down there or there's a lot of militaries that, it, there's a of money. There's a lot of entitlement, beautiful area, but for some reason the Hoya, it's like always, I don't know, there's always a fight.

Speaker 4:          00:32:24       There's always a fucking girl who's like, fuck you, like a couple breaks up. I'm like, what the fuck is happening? Um, I always have to kick people out of there. And so this guys in the front row and Kevin Christie was opening for me and Kevin's very incisive, like, he's very, like, he's kind of used to this comic, you know, and he's like kind of quiet and it doesn't speak a lot, but when he does, it's just exactly, it's just the truth. Like he's just so real like that. And uh, he said something once because he was on the road with me for awhile and like 35, 40 minutes into all my sets at the time, a guy would just snap and start yelling at me and he's like, I think what happens is they're like loving it. Funny, funny, female comedian, funny. It's funny, but like 40 minutes and you just become their wife or the girl that wouldn't fuck them or their mother or something.

Speaker 4:          00:33:11       And they just see you, it's like all of a sudden you just become a woman who's yelling at them and they're not allowed to talk back. One guy just we'll snap. It always happens. And I had one guy like storm the stage at me once and be like, who the fuck do you think you are? Like, I was like, and it didn't feel like it was about me at all. It felt like a very old wound, dark, sad and [inaudible]. I could tell right away. This has nothing to do with me and what you're talking about. Well, I'll tell you, I can. I do remember what the. This one guy in the front row that I comped was he sitting in the front and I was like doing it. And I did this. This was like my first special. I was getting my first special. I did this joke about how every guy, somewhere in his house or apartment or whatever has like a jar of coins or like a bowl of coins. You know where you guys put your change, like a change jar, bowl. You're red. You probably just have a fucking throw away trash, just put it right in the trash it away.

Speaker 4:          00:34:23       Oh my, that's amazing. So do you remember, I mean there was a point in your life where I'm sure you had one pennies up to make dinner. You guys have like a, you know, um, they're changed our. And so I just said it and it was like whatever. And then the guy went from like laughing, laughing, and then as soon as I said that joke, he just looked at me and he went, that's so we can pay for your shit. I was like, uh Oh. And from then on out, it was just like everything I said, he'd be like, well that's fucking, you did it on. And it's because if you didn't fucking spend so much money, he's literally, he's in the front row lawn and you know that loan by himself, by himself and you know that moment where someone's heckling and you're like, if only I can hear them, I'll keep going. But if the audience can hear them, I have to do something. So I finally had to, you had to go. But at the lawyer comedy store, there's like a window into the street, so he went outside and just stood in the window and stared at me for the rest of them. Remember he was just standing there and it was like, you know. So I think, I think comedy can really trigger trigger people. Sometimes it's you're drinking, you're out. You have someone talking about a guy that's willing to go to a comedy by himself

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       though. Sit in the front row already have red flags. Just kick that person out right away. This is the guy that emailed you. So you got different guys. Oh yes, yes, yes. He emailed and yeah, good point. So you, you have a connection with. He's probably thinking he's going to be in love with you. He's going to straighten you out. So you're a little too mouthy. He a little too talkative. You have too many opinions. And he's like, yeah, I'll fucking. I know Yo Berko girls love that. Well, you know, there are people that think that people need to be put in check and that people like it.

Speaker 4:          00:36:10       Comedian. I'll tell you,

Speaker 1:          00:36:14       I'll tell you the story now, but I'm not going to tell you who it is. Okay. Can I guess. Yes. But if you get it right, I'm not going to know until after if I get it right, just go. Don't. Because now I'm probably gonna do that anyway. Um, there is this thing, I think that exactly what you're talking to them. Um, I do think there is this thing

Speaker 4:          00:36:41       the same way women sometimes meet a man and they're like, I can fix him when he's probably not broken and is happy and fine or like I'll whip him into. I hear my friends say it all the time and I'm like, no, no, he's fine. He's, he's happy. You don't need to fix him. He doesn't think he's broken. And uh, I think sometimes guys with me or like I'll tame her, like I'll break her, you know, like I'll, um, and uh, there was this comedian who sent me a message on, I guess it was when I was on facebook or wasn't my space. It was one of those who I would always see around and I'm pretty elusive. Like you and I, we didn't get, we don't haven't got to hang at the comedy store that much, but like I kind of, I'm in and I'm out less, less, less so now like I would hang now because like cool people are there now, but when you were gone it was kind of toxic in there and it's intense and not like fun. Now it's little more fun. Um, and so I just get in and do my set and leave because I was trying to do a couple sets of night and um, uh, I would just be like, Hey, what's up? And we wouldn't flirt, but it would just be like, hey, and you know, the kind of person who wants to give you tags.

Speaker 1:          00:37:46       They're like, you know, what you should say there and it's like a.

Speaker 4:          00:37:51       and I get this message that was like rage, like a rage rage email that was like, you know, you don't know what you're like, you know, the basic jest of it. I don't remember how it started, but it ended in like, you don't know what makes you come.

Speaker 1:          00:38:08       I can show you what I know, like it was like, I was like, I obviously accidentally actually say that in come. I'm sure I still have the screen grab of it because I said, you know, I said to dad, how do you know what makes me.

Speaker 4:          00:38:22       I don't like it was just, but it was like this Alpha thing, like it was like a Alpha reaction I think, or something like I just need to make you shame you or something. I don't know what it was. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:38:35       well that's an alpha. Like what is that? What, what would it take for you to say that to a girl?

Speaker 3:          00:38:40       The crazy person who usually it's self obsessed, like delusional, delusional narcissism or something that's true. Narcissistic to just to reach out like that to you. That's, you know what that is. You are an accoutrement or you are like a, a, you're a piece of wardrobe in his life. Interesting. And you don't want him to try you on. You know what I'm saying? Like you like he's upset like you're in my life and it's not. Why aren't you doing what I want you to do? In my life, my life,

Speaker 2:          00:39:11       clinical narcissism is that everyone is an extension of you and if you're not doing what I wrote, you're acting out.

Speaker 3:          00:39:17       Yeah. That's interesting. Okay. Well, there's a lot of people that feel like that. I mean, that's a classic example of why Comedians don't like to work with other good comedians because they don't want anybody else doing well. Yeah. You know, they don't want anybody. It's got to be all about them. Like how many bad comedians do we know that take the fucking force people on the road with them. The worse, worse, worse, worse. It's so bad that you go, okay, do you hate your audience?

Speaker 2:          00:39:46       People I think were the funniest because I, my audience is paying money and you want to laugh to want to have fun. I have to watch them too. Exactly. It doesn't benefit me to have less talented people around me. I'd actually do the opposite to a fault. I feel like I tried to hire people who are more talented than me in every area of my life, so that it makes me look better.

Speaker 3:          00:40:03       Well, that's again, you. You're weirdly introspective in that way, but there's a lot of people that get into comedy because of all the scars of their childhood, like who we're talking about and they don't. They don't heal those things. Instead they just find workarounds. They find a way where they can sort of express themselves and and so it's almost like, see, I told Ya, I showed the world like they never come to a neutral point. They never get over the childhood where they go, Oh, okay. Well what am I doing? Is there a benefit to what I'm doing here? Should I just stop? If I'm healthy now, should I just stop what I'm doing or should I use what I'm doing and just enjoy it and have a good time? And then you realize that I probably got here because of an unhealthy obsession or because of a bad childhood or whatever, but now that I'm kind of moving past that, maybe I could use this position to just have some fun

Speaker 2:          00:40:54       in exactly what you're saying. Like you just made it so clear to me what I was not being clear about in the beginning of the, you know, if you bring unfunny people on the road years really funny comparatively, and so all of a sudden you've created this little world for yourself where you become this king of the idiots, but if you were to step outside that world, you're all of a sudden at the bottom of the food chain, like you create a world where at the top of the food chain, which is why it was important to me to go to other countries, be around people that have no idea who I am, that I don't pay that don't think I'm funny. That can you understand what I'm saying? It's just very humbling and then you're like, oh, who am without all this stuff

Speaker 4:          00:41:35       without achievements and money and car or what a car, whatever it is, you know, because I'm afraid that I might do that by accident. You know? Because if you have people around you who are paid, who are afraid to say no to you, that's how you stop getting funny. Everyone around you is like, like I saw Chris Rock at the store wants, I'm sure you have this where he was working on, I don't know, like not the Oscars or something. And he got on stage and he said something that was just like, Hey, I'm sorry I'm late. I've, you know, my car was, you know, I couldn't find a spot for it. Never was like, ha ha ha. And he was like, that wasn't funny. Please don't laugh unless I say something funny, please treat me like I'm normal. Yeah. He was like, that's how comics stopping funny is because people enable the and you know, they use it when you get so big like you. It's like, you know, people stop as. I mean your audience I'm sure is really, you know.

Speaker 3:          00:42:29       Well we can all be guilty of it, you know, I think just what you're talking about is like navigating all these landmines that success can setup for you. Put It, you know, which are better land minds than failure, but still landmines and the landmines of fame or particularly intoxicating because when someone has a bunch of fans that say, oh my God, you know Mike, fuck faces here. Yay. Oh my God, it's Mike. And they go run up to you. I can't believe you're so amazing. Thank you. Thank you very much. Take a picture with me. I'm cool with God. You know, and it's. It becomes this thing where you, you, you, you get accustomed to that

Speaker 4:          00:43:06       so myopic and you forget that there's 6 billion people that don't have

Speaker 3:          00:43:11       any fucking idea who you are. And if Mike fuck face is around Tony Mcdonald face and Tony Mick, Dick face is more famous like Tony Minute dictations a movie out now. Then Mike Fuck. Face gets really mad. Like Tony Big Dick face. Exactly right. You ever seen those guys before? Both

Speaker 4:          00:43:27       represented by Barry Katz. I think they just left. Yeah. Yeah. They're doing his podcast. They just wanted the three yards, but it's. But is that sort of. I literally found myself, because it's also, if you do achieve anything, it doesn't matter because you're just comparing yourself some with more achievements. So I'm recreating this feeling of failure at every level of success and recreating this unhappiness at every level where I have no real problems. You know? It's like, yeah, I have my bullshit problem. They're fake problems. It's like, you know, it's like, yeah, my parents are sick. Yeah. I have a lot of, you know, real things, but it's also, it's like, you know, I can pay the bill to get them. Like I literally am going through this thing where it's like nursing homes and care for, for older people. And I'm like, the fuck, do people pay for this? I have to go on tour to pay for it. I mean I have to, you know, thank God I get to do that for a living and the casinos and shit. But it's a fortune. And I'm like, oh. And my dad is, you know, is a vet. And I looked at the vet facilities and was just like, are you fund

Speaker 5:          00:44:32       this? This is where vets go. The guys that fucking lost their limbs for our country, this is where you're putting them. I mean that's her dying fucking facility.

Speaker 3:          00:44:41       We had to do these. We did these benefits, these events called fight for the troops and we did these for the intrepid in intrepid, center for excellence, which is sounds cool and establishment that they. They've the, these facilities, they're creating these state of the art facilities to deal with people with traumatic brain injuries and so they showed us all these guys and it's unbelievably heartbreaking. See these people like with their wives and their children and their families and they're trying to rehabilitate them and then going through all these steps. But what was more disheartening than anything was to realize that all this stuff is privately funded because the United States government just. They don't allocate enough money to treatment of these troops when they get home. They just don't. So we have to raise all this money for these people. So while we're doing this, like they wanted us to talk about it at the beginning of it and I have to measure myself because it's on television and it's what I want to say is this is fucking crazy that we have to do a fight to raise. We're going to give people brain damage so that we can

Speaker 5:          00:45:47       no raise money for brain damage and raise the money for all the weapons you that they really seem to find money for it, but not for the humans that use the weapon but these guys. But it's so ironic in a lot of ways because these people are fighting. Okay. And if they're fighting. So like a bunch of people got knocked out in the show. So they got some brain damage and I mean obviously they're competing, it's their decision, they're, they're going for glory. The trying to make it as a fighter, but were the end result is they're this, they're getting pounded on so that we can make money. It's crazy. So they could help people who have brain damage. It's a must. That is the most Chinese finger trap. Oh my God. It's like the amount of brain damage you get from MMA is so minuscule and compared to an ied, but it's also, why the fuck do we not set money aside for this?

Speaker 5:          00:46:38       Why? How could there be what? Find out what every congressman gets. Find out what everybody's. Every senator gets. Chop a chunk of that shit out and send it to the intrepid center. I mean, there's gotta be a way that there's gotta be some fucking red tape and bureaucracy that you can cut and you could send some of that money to help take care of these people that you are forcing to go overseas and fight these battles. A friend of mine who was in the army, he told me that the statistic on vets committing suicide, it's insane. It's insane. I want to say yours, what I want to say. What's one every like seven minutes. Oh yeah, it is. It's something like that. Yeah. Well Jamie can look it up, but it's fucking insane. It's more people die of 22 a day. Oh my God. Twenty two a day in 2012 more US soldiers committed suicide than were killed in. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       Yeah. I mean it's like, what do you mean? It's just, it's, it's too crazy. And um, yeah. And then I'm like, Oh God, where is my soy milk? I'm amazed. It's only 22 a day. I thought it was. No, I thought it was one every seven minutes or something. But that's an average. Maybe it is some days I don't like throwing statistics around on this.

Speaker 5:          00:47:50       No, no. Talking about people that have served. I just know too many. I know too much of it. I've talked to too many guys and I, I've, I've talked to too many people that, you know, the reality of it is so bleak.

Speaker 2:          00:48:01       And also, uh, from what little I know about it is that um, and then the drone guys are, is a real nightmare because there's all this Ah, you know, normally when you are in combat and you come back, you do a physical neutralization period. Like you go to Germany or some for like five days and like they chill you out before you go back to your family and kids after you've just been combat. But these drone guys, not only is the technology is so advanced that they're seeing all these women and children, they're not in the fog of war, right? They don't just see like threat threat threat because when you are getting shot at a kid is might as well be a guy with a gun. So, so these guys are seeing these people getting shot super close up. They're not able to. They're seeing their own guys get shot, like they're seeing it and then they go upstairs to their wife and kids and there's just no period for their brains to acclimate to it. And it's, there's a serious atrophy of a drone pilots and they're just raise the wages of it so that it'll attract more because so few people want to do it. Really to doing it in your basement like a video game just, um, is actually even more traumatic oddly. But also the suicide rate. Apparently it's even worse among the soldiers that didn't kill anyone. Anyone, because they have guilt and shame about it. Whoa. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:49:16       Well, from what I've talked to with guys that were in the seals are rangers, special operatives guys, is that those guys have way less issues. Seals and rangers. Okay. Because first of all, mentally they're going to be the most durable. Yeah. Yeah. It's never the strongest guys. That's always the most. Yeah. Well, those guys are terrible. Mentally more durable. They have a better understanding. They have way deeper and more intense comradery than the average person does. And then on top of that, they're, they're proactive. They're the ones who were hunting down bad guys. They're not waiting for people to attack them. They're going after that. So it's a totally different kind of thing. Like if they plot a mission and they're going to go fuck somebody up, like they're, they're, they're hunting. They're not being hunted when you're being hunted. That's where the stress comes. Food,

Speaker 2:          00:50:10       I wanted to send you this, you probably already read it. It's called Sapiens I think. And uh, it's essentially, it's about anxiety and this a book you just touched, that was a different one. I realized I had been texting you too many books.

Speaker 5:          00:50:26       Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:50:28       both can fill out to say most girls said, you know, naked photos, new tags. I said science books, like, no wonder I'm fucking alone. Uh, and uh, it's about anxiety and everyone's like, I have anxiety, I have anxiety. And it's like anxiety is actually talks about sort of the origin of it. And there's, it's two pronged. One is because I had a lot of shame about anxiety too. And anxiety, shame about it. Like why am I anxious? It's like we're actually supposed to be anxious, you know, just as by the laws of survival of the fittest. The fittest were the ones that were anxious, you know, thousands of years ago, the anxious, hypervigilant people were the ones that were like, well, there's fucking tiger we should move. And the ones that didn't have anxiety just got eaten alive. And you're definitely one of the watchers. Yeah, I think I've definitely, I've had anxiety.

Speaker 4:          00:51:11       They come and watch sleep. I know you're up at night. It's why we've got weed. Yeah. You're also a scene of a comedian. So you live a night life. Yeah. I have adrenaline, uh, people who grew up in hectic homes who produced Adrenalin young usually have an adrenaline addiction. Oh, I definitely have that. Yeah. Because your body is producing so much, John. It's addictive. You must huge. Also, to your point just now is there was. I never thought. Of course I hadn't thought about it. I'm not smart enough to, but I have never known that humans are not designed to be at the top of the food chain. We're only at the top of the food chain because we have weapons and the reason we have weapons is because we had really large brains, which was actually not helpful at all. It's really inefficient and uneconomical for energy because I guess our brains burned like 25 or 30 percent of our calories or something.

Speaker 4:          00:51:57       So chimpanzees and apes head smaller brains. They were able to climb trees and avoid threats. Like a big brain is like a disaster except that we invented tools, so we sort of not based on merit. We superficially, once we embedded tools jumped to the top of the food chain, but we don't deserve to be there because without weapons a lot of species would kill us, but we can figure out weapons. So of course we deserve to be there totally. But as soon as the weapons are gone, we're vulnerable. So vulnerable to animals. Yes to a lot because we're not truly at the top of the food chain. We only are at the top of the food chain if we have a weapon. So there's that anxiety. A turtle without a shell, but the second you drop your weapon, you're in the middle of the food channel and drop it. Bitch.

Speaker 4:          00:52:43       I'm not as agile as you fucking weapon. That's how you stay alive. That's what. That's the anxiety. Hold the fucking weapon. Don't drop it and be and keep your shit together and keep on fucking high alert because the second, if your back is to Elian and the weapons pointing this way, you're still gonna die. You know the lines are problematic. Even if you have a weapon, it's like, yeah, they eat Bolus for fucking breakfast. This balance of the second you run out of bullets, it's over. Well, you know, when, when you think about what made a human a human, it's really fascinating because it becomes like what came first, the chicken or the egg, like what were we like when we will Australia pacificus, you know, they have these depictions of us and what we looked like all hairy and

Speaker 5:          00:53:26       with fucking sloped foreheads and shit. We were pretty close to people but not really people. And when you really look at the fossil record, what they understand that these were only talking about this kind of person like you and I for a couple of hundred thousand years. Yeah. That's so recent. So recent. It's so weird. I have an extra bone in my foot. What I have. What's your foot doing? My feet are webbed. Is that a turn off of all those foot fetishes? Um, you know what's so funny is that I'm wearing flip flops today. It's real power move. You know, there's human. You really have webbed feet. No, I don't. I'm joking. But there are these foot fetishes, however you. Hi. Hi Guys. There's foot fetishes.

Speaker 2:          00:54:08       It's out there and like if you google me, I think when you come me his feet is like the second or third one, which I um, you know, I mean that's for most people in the public eye, like feet is always like to like google charlise Aaron don't do it and just see what the, see what they come up, you know. Um, so I'm, I'm really afraid that if I had met this, although I'm going to lose my foot fetish demo, but I had this pain in my foot and I think we're probably a little bit similar you much more so. But um, I have a pretty high tolerance for pain. He just learned it, grind and go to doctors growing up. It's just like suck it up. That's what I caught on fire. I went to school, like that's basically like how my family was.

Speaker 2:          00:54:47       You just suck it up and you man up. So I had this pain in my foot or my, like my big toe and then my third toe, like once every two weeks, like real bad and it would be like, it's just a stabbing, awful pain. But I just was like, oh, that's my foot, like once every two weeks my foot has like a spasm and it lasts for like, I don't know, like two minutes and then I get through it and I was in a writer's room one day and my feet were up on the table and then I was like, had the pain came and I was like, and I'm like screaming, and two minutes later I'm like, anyway, so, uh, act three, what should we. And everyone's like, what the fuck was that? I was like, Oh, I have this thing, I have this foot spasm that happens once every two weeks. It's just like my foot. And everyone was like, no, that's not a thing. That's not a, you have to get, go to a podiatrist. First Time I've ever went to a podiatrist and he gave me an extra and he's like, Oh, you have an extra foot. I'm sorry you have an but even extra bone in your foot between your second and third toe. And he's like, it's basically just remanence of being an android

Speaker 5:          00:55:46       really. Now is it? It's not bone spurs like a broken foot

Speaker 2:          00:55:51       quarterly, just like an extra. You can't really see it. It's just like an extra bone right here. Whoa. Like one think. Hmm. You know, because we used to have more bones in our feet and you're just like, that's fucking real. Like it was not that long ago. Why would we have extra bones though? What was it? Something about the uh, uh, I'll find out for you. It's something about the webbing or something.

Speaker 5:          00:56:19       My friend Steve Rinella went to Bolivia and he stayed with Toumani, the tribe, the tribe and Bolivia. And they don't wear shoes and they live in the rainforest and their feet, their feet are splayed out. It's interestingly, our feet are like this and that. Kinetic or is it worn from rights? Worn from writing all the time. So let's just walking constantly barefoot. But like our feet are like this where their feet are spread, like their toes are spread out. Women's in America, like all. Yeah, they're all getting old. So many girls I see in their feet, their toes are taken left and right. They're just trying to run away from each other. These fucking shoes that don't show. They're not shaped like a foot cocktail. Shrimp who's fucking feet are shaped like that Asian bound. That's like they have to do it. Right. That's what these Toumani people.

Speaker 5:          00:57:10       Rinella was there and he was walking through the woods with these people and he was like, this is incredible. Because they've never had shoes. They don't have any shoes. And if you give them shoes, they try them on. They're like, what the fuck? And they throw it aside and they have these thick, thick soles of their feet. Sure. Confirm. Just constantly. That's my. That's exactly like you keep saying my goal, like you're, we acclimate to where we are. So I want to have the thick, thick sole in my personality. I want to be that person as the. I don't want to be the one who has the Pha is like can fall apart. Yes. Yes. I don't want to be this like, oh my God, do you have like Stevia? Like I don't. I, I started realizing I had all these fucking needs. Don't you think change means that we see around us constantly because it's so socially enforced.

Speaker 5:          00:58:00       It's so like coconut milk, soy milk and did a $6 latte and it becomes normal after a while and I was like, this is not fucking normal. Also comforting to like behave in these patterns that we've already seen before. It makes you feel like you're a normal person and it makes us feel like because we're designed to be part of a tribe and to fit in and standing out, it's like produces, you know, stress because it means we're less safe. And I was like, I do not want to like, because you drive around and you're like, oh this fucking asshole, this whole asshole. And you're like, I'm one of those assholes. Right? I've got to remove myself from the situation and go watch kids have surgery for, you know, a lot of that, these asshole things like the fucking bro rage and all that jazz.

Speaker 5:          00:58:36       A lot of that goes away when you're in a small town. Tell me, that's interesting. In Boulder, one of the things that I've found, and I was only in boulder for a few months, but one of the things that I've found when I was there, I was like, people drive way more polite. They're way nicer, like they let people in and they don't cut people off as much stone. No, no, no. That too, but there's less of them. There's only 100,000 people in town. So when you have a small community, first of all there's less diffusion of responsibility because you and that person is probably going to see each other again. So if I give someone the finger on the highway on the four or five, what are the odds I'm going to meet that? Do it again? Zero. Probably there's less like accountable. We can be more anonymous and more.

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       You have more responsibility as a community. Like if you see someone pulled over the side of the road, you have more desire to pull over and help

Speaker 2:          00:59:29       dumb. It's like tribal. I mean that's really like a tribe mentality.

Speaker 3:          00:59:33       Like there was these people that were pushing their car the other day and they were on the side of the road and I was thinking, fuck, shut, get out of the car and help them push the car. And uh, I think I watched them do it. I'm like, yeah, they're okay. They got it. It's up on the hill there, there it's up on the, uh, the curb there. They're going to be okay. But I was thinking like if this was a small town for sure, I'd pull over and I was thinking that at that moment, because of the time that I spent living in Boulder, I was, I was amazed at how polite people were and also the less people like in the town, like when I was in this town in the mountains, they would wave when you would go by and people lift their hand up when you would drive by, he'd pass each other and everybody and I got used to doing it and we all did it, you know, as you were driving this way or that person driving that way, you will lift your hand up and you wave to them because there's not that many of you see in La. I think they're so fucking many people that we lose the idea of value of, uh, of our fellow humans because our fellow humans become a bird fight.

Speaker 3:          01:00:30       Yeah. Become a burden. There's too many of us. And so there's a lot of benefit in that. Like for guys like you or for people like you and I, it's great because there's so many clubs we can work at, you know, there's so much variety as far as like restaurants we could eat at are places we can go and so much culture to see. But also you're dealing with this massive volume of people and it's hard to keep your perspective. It's hard to keep your perspective just with the sheer numbers and I think in a lot of ways it mirrors what we're talking about with even with celebrity or fame or with wealth that it's hard to keep perspective. Like for people, people need adversity, difficult situations that we need things in order to keep our perspective.

Speaker 2:          01:01:08       You know what's interesting? Have you been to Tokyo? Yes. So Tokyo is liked hectic. I mean there's not as many. It's not as much of a car culture, but there's a weird. I wonder what part of it's cultural, whether cars play it because it's really. Everything is times square. Totally. That's like a big time square, but there's like this concept of space and it's not like when I go to New York it's like fuck you, fuck you, excuse me. You know, and it's like you're just like in a rat race. Whereas in Tokyo there was this weird harmonic sort of. It's almost like choreographed, so less of a like I don't know what that. Less aggression. More respect. Yeah. Maybe it's. Maybe it is that cultural thing we were talking about earlier, but it's less of like I get it. Maybe it's maybe it's because we live in a capitalist society where it's all like we're competing with everybody too, but they compete in a very different way than we do

Speaker 3:          01:01:56       compete with. They have a lot of honor and behavior patterns and this is expected to follow. It's a very different world, but I was amazed how polite people were in Tokyo. I was just literally,

Speaker 2:          01:02:08       I got. I mean I accidentally was rude so many because when a cab picks you up, you're not allowed to open the door. The door opens and it's considered rude. If you open the door yourself, close at

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       driver gets up and opens and closes it for you. Yeah, like it's rude to do something for yourself and it's um, it's weird because I just, it makes you feel like you're going to be robbed because everyone's like, how can I help you? It's like the service is like, you know, as you said, it's all about honor and dignity and taking pride in your work, which were all about fucking shortcuts. It's like, how do I know all about doing something the most difficult way, like doing or the most painstaking gains. Like Samurais there was never seen an actual Samurai sword. Now of course Joe's got one in his pocket. Guys. Cheeses from the 15 hundreds. Okay. The Real Samurai sword from the 15 hundreds, like legitimately. And if you look at that blade, that blade was made by some guy, so turned on right now. Steel pounded it, folded it over, pounded it again, folded it over, pounded again.

Speaker 1:          01:03:16       It takes for ever for. You can see if you look at the actual emily line. No. Well, that's so much more humanizing. It's like if there's just an assembly line that's making these, you know, as a human, you just feel like a robot. You feel like you are robbed of your individuality. Right. You know, this is like, you can take pride in your work, but they did a different than anybody. They did it different than anybody who's making swords. I mean they, they had sword making and sort of get your core feel on point for this. The real deal. Is this to actually kill people or is this the Samurai fight? Probably killed people. What do you think it feels like to stab someone? I bet it's not easy. Easy. In what way? I mean, you're way stronger than me. That's a good. So if you're, what's the stomach?

Speaker 1:          01:04:03       It's probably pretty. You need to create a replica of what it would be like to stab someone. Would it be like watermelon? No. You kill a deer. Oh yeah. Get like an animal that's not obvious, but like ribs, ribs stop it. No ribs can if you're weak, you know? But it depends on how heavy the blade is. Like does anyone ever tried to stab someone? It's like the ribs just stopped the whole thing from for sure, because that's what ribs are for. To protect your. Yeah, I mean a weak person who stabs you in the wrong spot with a small knife is probably not going to get it in, but somebody who stabs you with that fucking thing, the odds of that not going through your ribs, pretty small. If you're a strong person, most likely you're going to penetrate their entire body, but it's also mirrored in archery bowhunting. That's like one of the most important aspects of bowhunting is to have a heavier Arrow that has a sharp blade with a powerful bow. So it goes through bone, so it goes through the ribs, doesn't go through the rows of it, stops at the ribs. Then you just have a wounded animal. Where are you on bone marrow? Tiny thing. It's good. My nails, my hair, like it's like that. In that same book, it talks about how bone marrow, um, human brain, uh,

Speaker 5:          01:05:18       exponentially went up when humans started eating the bone marrow of animal because they couldn't have their own animals. They had to eat the leftover bone trash, right. But that's actually where all the vitamins negotiating with. There's so many questions and so many theories about what caused the doubling of the human brain size over a period of 2 million years is really a fascinating subject because they just don't know. There's all this speculation. There's something that was the, um, the ability to throw the throwing arm because it's one of the most unique aspects of a person. There's no other animal that can take a rock and throw it with accuracy like a person can. So like ground nesting birds, things along those lines. That hand eye coordination and like a chimpanzee can throw something but doesn't mean it's going to hit the target. It doesn't have the synapses, it doesn't have the connections and it's mine that allow it to be like really accurate at distance.

Speaker 5:          01:06:10       Like a person. Like think about like a pitcher who could throw a fastball. How many feet is it to plate? Sixty to 62 feet. I think that's also, we were evolved to see underwater, right? Like fish as first started. So we're actually, our vision is I wonder, well if you ever read the theory, so please, if you ever read the aquatic ape theory. Nope. The aquatic ape theory is really bizarre. It's very controversial, but the idea is that human beings come out of the womb with so much body fat and we're so different than chimpanzees in that regard. Like a chimpanzee baby is like a chimpanzee adult. It's just little ds, but a human babies filled with fat super fat. Most species are born ready to go. Ours are born completely helpless, just helpless, but fat like covered in fat. And the idea is that we were in water and that we developed and we possibly evolved around water to the point where babies like if you throw a chimpanzee baby in the water, they fucking drown.

Speaker 5:          01:07:13       They just the day breathe water and they drown. You throw a human baby in the water. The instinctively hold their breath because they're basically fish until they're born. Like the Nirvana cover with the baby in the water. Yeah. Yeah. Like when my kid, my kids learned how to swim when they were babies, we taught them when they were really little, we got them instruction. But one of the things you realize like people, it's a very natural thing to hold your breath and go on to walk. Yeah, it's totally instinctive. And so the aquatic eight theory theorized is that at one point in our evolution we were primarily water bound and that may be we went into the water to get away from predators or that maybe we figured out a way to develop in the water as lower hominids do, so no other animal holds their breath either though about no other animal, but I know that other primates don't. Other primates just fucking drowned. Webbed at some point is, is that for swimming? Didn't we have web? That's true because chimps don't. I don't know if that's true. We might have. I mean we certainly don't. Some go wait, but every now and then have webbed feet,

Speaker 1:          01:08:17       but that could be just an aberration lip, cleft palate. Yeah, that's true. I don't know why you'd have a web. I mean maybe it, maybe it makes sense. Here's a controversial thing, we kind help you swim. Right? But it didn't get in the way. If you wanted to like do shit, it would. It'd be a problem. But I mean they weren't texting, but again, the way from your instagraming lot of things is climb trees. Oh yeah. Like stupid. Well making tools. I think it maybe we'd get in the way it makes your fingers less agile but not webbed hands. Would it be helpful if he would help? Because our toes can't do anything or toes are useless for swimming flipper, but there's something about our fingers to. If you think about like the, the dexterity and the control that we have over our hands. It's so unusual in comparison to any other animal and our fingers that when our fingers get all wet and what does that wrinkly.

Speaker 1:          01:09:19       There was this interesting study about how fingers after being in water for two hours could pick up more marbles then dry hands. Huh? Which kind of means that we must have needed to be in the water a lot. Does that what it means or is it just a side effect of just your fingers getting wrinkly? Yeah, but why would they get wrinkly if it wasn't useful for something? Or is that just why? Why do people get cancer? Don't get me started on turnover. That is that. Is there a benefit to that? How many things are a benefit of things are not designed to live past like 30, right? Well we definitely didn't live past 30 a long time ago. Very often. True. No, I like it. I just, I'm such a Klutz seat like I'm afraid. I'm just thinking just like slapped his fucking head.

Speaker 1:          01:10:12       Just didn't happen. Scientist think they've answered with the skin on human fingers and toes shrivels up like an old proven. When we soak in the bath. Laboratory tests confirmed that theory, that wrinkly fingers improve our grip on wet or submerged objects working to channel away the water like a rain treads and car tires. You know why it makes sense because the rest of your skin doesn't do that. Like if your elbow got all wrinkly. That's true. So a evolutionary neurobiologist and his colleagues just that wrinkling being an active process must have an evolutionary function. The team also showed the pattern and wrinkling appeared to be optimized for that. Providing a drainage network that improved grip makes sense. So maybe we were trying to get fish or some shit rocks. Well, you know, it totally makes sense. It does. It does. That doesn't happen when you sweat. Does it know mostly really just fuckers. I'm sure you've talked about it a lot. Um, I think activity is good. I think exercise is good and I think, you know, those people, a lot of them are

Speaker 5:          01:11:14       very fit and. But I think that like a lot of things when you take certain aspects of physical activity, like Steve Maxwell, who's a good friend of mine and he's a strength and conditioning coach, he said it best that physical fitness, like I'm lifting weights and engaging in exercise activities he doesn't believe is a sport in unto itself. He thinks it's good at getting you strong for other sports. Now when you turn into a sport like who can do the most clean and presses, who could do the most, uh, you know, whatever, a dead lifts in an hour, he doesn't think that that's healthy because in this is he's far more qualified than I am to answer this. So I'm using his rationale. He thinks that power lifting and bodybuilding movement or powerlifting and weightlifting movements like dead lifts or like cleans and presses, you shouldn't do them for like sets of 30 and 40 and 50, and having these competition to see who can do the most.

Speaker 5:          01:12:16       He's like, it's just not beneficial. It's not he, he's of the school of thought that you should like strength lifting exercises are strength producing exercises. Should it be done with a low repetitions and you know, you should take breaks in between them. And it's about building the physical strength of your body. It's not about performing them in a contest. Now the crossfit people, I think if I could speak for them, I think they think of it as a healthy lifestyle and that this competition, it makes them work harder and they all work out together and I definitely see their point. And if you follow crossfit people, ms.one of the things about crossfit people that they say like if someone's a crossfit and they're a Vegan, what do they talk about first? Because. Have you ever seen that? Because it's like a meme. I think it was on like a, it was like a chalk board that was in front of a coffee shop.

Speaker 5:          01:13:11       Yeah, well it's, it's one of those things we get excited about it like vegans the most proselytizing vegans and you'd talk to them like one of the things I've found because a lot of vegans get really upset with me because I eat meat, but one of the things that I've found with a lot of them is that I'll go to their instagram page after the shit on me and I say, I just found a bacon fucking sandwich that's four months old. So it means, how long have you been a Vegan? I've been Vegan for three months. It's three months. It's opened my eyes up. I found my favorite person online the other day. He's a Vegan. Who believes the earth is flat. It's a flat rate to eat. Um, oh yeah. The flat earth, flat earth people. There is a lot of people out there that believes the fucking earth is flat. They believe that it's all a hoax and then NASA is a hoax and that satellites aren't real and that there is airplanes that are flying high and that's where we're getting like direct tv from and then it's all a giant, vast conspiracy. And here's my favorite part. Gravity's not real and that the earth exists. The reason why we're, we're staying put because electromagnetism, I mean

Speaker 4:          01:14:12       I don't, I'm not even going to. I don't even know how to respond to that. Just just be headings. Think of how many astronomers and these are the people having kids. These people are just procreating all day with other people that they think all these people were in on it and they think that if you look at the horizon, like there's, there's videos, there's like a video that shows like the 200 reasons why they can prove that the earth is flat and it's so fucking stupid. Hurts my feelings. Really. It, it, it makes me. So maybe it's my mind nightwatch or fight or flight thing, but like when I hear that I just feel like I'm in danger. But you are like, it's just like a stupid people make me feel unsafe. What it is is there's a lot of religions out there. Religion actually serves a. I understand the neurological purpose it serves. Um, but you know, don't be.

Speaker 5:          01:15:05       What else can I say is there's religions. I mean the word religion, let's just ditch it. Let's just. What is the, what's the mental pathway that one's one follows when they adhere to an ideology. And I think we're all guilty of it to a certain extent. We all have them.

Speaker 4:          01:15:21       We need. And I think there needs to be something in place. It's like don't kill people like guilt and shame used to keep societies controlled and have a sense of order. Sure. Guns and before prisons and before shit was organized, it was like God's going to get. You had to come up with something to keep people from raping each other and murdering everyone.

Speaker 5:          01:15:42       Right. And at least stopping it. Don't do it again. Yeah. Like, you know, let's, let's, let's nip this shit in the bud. Let's figure out what the business opportunity. It was like, oh, I can charge for this. Well, you know, I mean, look, there's, there's countless examples of people creating these behavior patterns that other folks are forced to follow and these ideologies, they will. You see the way people think and I think to a certain extent, there's a lot of like really what w, what people called the regressive left. Like when people get mad at a white guy for wearing dreadlocks and they say this is cultural appropriation. You taking black people's culture. Like that sort of same thing is a kin to religious people that want to force women to dress a certain way or want to force gay people to act a certain way.

Speaker 5:          01:16:32       There's there's parts of certain ideologies that literally exists because someone is trying to exert control over other people and they think they can because it's a rule too. I try it like the like the other. It's a bad example that I used about the dreadlocks because it's so fucking stupid because first of all, vikings wear dreadlocks. The Greeks had dread locks. It's a white thing to a dirty hair thing, you know? It's just, it's a scale. Only had dreadlocks until it's so. It's so stupid, but it's. It's a new way that people can get upset at certain groups and the left like especially like what people. Like a lot of people get upset with that term.

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       The regressive left, but it's a good term and the reason why it's a good terms because they're, first of all, they're attacking straight there all. They're attacking white gay men now for having privileges that I've wrote this whole article about white gay privilege as opposed to black men and people of color who are gay, who don't get to experience the same freedom that white gay people do that live in white neighborhoods and have, you know, adopt white babies. It's easier for them. I mean it's, it's attacking it, this constant,

Speaker 2:          01:17:39       but we love. I think it was you. We were texting about this. People love being outrageous and I don't know what the creational outrage. They love complaint and I think it is a form of bonding and I think it has helped people connect to each other and like, you know, organize and stuff. People love being offended. They love being insulted. They love, they love racism because then they get to complain about it and began to take the moral high ground, get to be sanctimonious and they get to be, you know. Right. And it's just like,

Speaker 3:          01:18:04       I think that sort of thinking, I don't want to call it religion because I think it's a pattern and patterns of these ideologies. I think it's problematic when you label it like this is because of God, this is, but it's these, these patterns that people force their mind into, well some people force themselves into these patterns where everything is a fucking conspiracy and that this is how you get to this like delusional state of mind that would allow you to think that the earth is flat or that, you know, the government's run by Reptilians.

Speaker 2:          01:18:34       But to me intelligence is kind of someone being able to go, I think this is how it is or not, or not being married to your idea. Just like I could totally be fucking wrong. Like, you know, I think it's just like what? Like what is this? Like all my, all my self esteem and identity is linked to this lie. It's like how sad and lonely is that person that they need to attach to some idea that it's just, it's just so odd to me. I mean I think comedians are brains are a little. We like we can go through our set and say argue a point, argue against our own point, go back on. And then someone had called and it's like, well that's a good point. Like, I mean, I, I feel very lucky that we have brains that are able to see everybody's side didn't. That's kind of what we do for a living, but it's very shocking to me. It seems so suffocating and isolating and weird to just be stuck on one thing.

Speaker 3:          01:19:31       Sure. It's easy to be. It's so common. It's obviously easy to them is their home, you know. And if you think something and someone proves you wrong, you will be angry and you will defend that original idea as if it's a part of someone's trying to steal.

Speaker 2:          01:19:46       Yes. Why are you insulting me? I take from me. Yes, it does. People react to it. Like stealing. That's so intense.

Speaker 3:          01:19:52       That's when you can see right away that there's an issue. Yeah, because people take it very personally. If you don't share that belief

Speaker 2:          01:20:00       are the ones that detached from their belief systems the fastest, like doctors and scientists like mirror neurons. It was all about mirror neurons like a couple of years ago. Right?

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       And then they recently just debunk that theory and scientists. I'd be like, oops, we were wrong, you know, you know, that's what science is all. But I didn't mind who's a doctor. I was like, because he's always like, oh, and then I'm at my practice. And I was like, do you guys feel like it's weird that you call it practice, you know, do you want to call it good at, nailed it or the game time? I'm at my game time championship game. And he's like, no, it's called practice because the medicine is doing the best we can with what we know. There's lots of we don't know. You know, and in 10 years we're going to be doing looking back. And they were like, I can't believe you fucking did that. That was dangerous. You know, that's like what medicine and sciences like you're wrong every five years there's a new fucking piece of information.

Speaker 1:          01:20:46       Did you see the latest thing that I tweeted yesterday that they've given approval to people? Do you stem cells to try to regenerate dead people's brains? Love it. What was just so fucking horror moving? I mean, that's what everybody was tweeting just zombies with is how it makes zombies to bring people back to life or put their old brain into a new person's body. I think. Well, there's that too. To find out. Here it is. Biotech company granted ethical permission to attempt to use stem cells to reactivate the brains of the dead. Catch their killer or like. No, I don't think so. That'd be crazy to like, hey, who killed you? Alright, you, but go back to sleep. I want to see what I want to know what the conversation was because the, the. They've been granted ethical permission by an institutional review board. I didn't know there was an institutional review board.

Speaker 1:          01:21:33       That's not a real company in the US and in India, India, they're going to take the brains of the babies. They smashed into a lot of alive people in America. There's a lot of people in dumb people. Yeah, exactly. Use Twenty brain dead patients for what a shorted be. Okay. Buried in comas or comatose or something. Look what they're calling it. The reanimate project. Oh, fucking Christ. Sounds like an enema. What are you doing, Jimmy? This is it. Oh God. A second chance at life. Oh my God. Magnolia. It's also, by the way, the worst thing about this is it's a shitty website is terrible. I'm not going to. I know if my. If I had to do this on like a family member on squarespace. Totally guides. You've got like, this is like comedy central site, proven scientific concepts. This is insane. Exploring the potential of cutting edge biomedical technology for human neuro regeneration and how much, how much, how much is a consummation neuro reanimation is. So when you see reanimator, I think of that fucking movie reanimator movie where they brought the monsters that brought the people back to life when they were monsters movies. Reanimator like some mad scientist ladies. Hold on. Is it exciting? Is it a private thing? Like if I'm like, I want to reanimated one invest. Yeah. No, that's all you're doing right now. I feel like you probably have some fighter Fred's who could use this. Oh, I know. We both have a couple of my

Speaker 5:          01:23:06       fucking inject some shit in there. Fixing. Well, Brian has never been hit. He doesn't even have any real excuses. Oh, I'm sure his wife said I'm sure, but he likes to box lately. Brian's into boxing and I think he is way worse for you, isn't it? Well, it's all bad for you in fucking soccer gives you brain damage. Your head's not to get as opposed to get jostled around too much, but goes every direction except it goes right except down. I have a buddy of mine who's a professor who's 49 or 50 and he kicked boxes. He's bars and I'm like, but you know, you understand this like you're into this, you know, he's a history professor. Like you understand that this is dangerous for your brand, but you get so much enjoyment out of the thrill of being primal actually been in their sparring.

Speaker 2:          01:23:54       Let me ask you a question. Did we, we didn't talk about this last time, that calcium storico thing in Italy once they bare knuckle football with bare knuckle boxing. Insane. Insane. So I was going to go to about that documentary. Yes. And Pete Berg I think ended up making it anyway, but we were like just broken up and I'm like, why am I making a documentary with my ex boyfriend? This is really self abusive, but it's apparently the, the month that it happens, violence in the area goes down. Of course. Yeah. So there's something interesting about these guys who want to go spar. Like maybe they're sexually harassing less women at work. Maybe they're having less bar fights. This calcium storico. So it was invented in the 16 hundreds to entertain kings. It was stopped because so many people were dying. And then I want to say 1916, they brought it back. They keep it low profile because so many people get concussions in sick group kickboxing. I think 20 on 20 a the only rule is no two on one. These are grown men. These are not young like athletes. They're not professional athletes are butchers, they're lawyers.

Speaker 5:          01:25:01       Whatever. Exchange partners like guys just moved and a new guy moved in and they just touched hands. Like one guy was duking it out with a guy and then for some reason they changed it.

Speaker 2:          01:25:09       Bare knuckle. Yeah, it's also by by region, so it's like neighborhoods against neighborhoods. So a lot of it's like fathers against sons, brothers against brothers,

Speaker 5:          01:25:18       the change teammates, like two guys were fighting and then another guy steps in and takes the place. First of all, these guys have dogs, good

Speaker 2:          01:25:26       skills, but it's no, these are not a guy just stepped in. These professional athletes, these are literally guys that have other jobs once a year. They just agree to fucking just gets pretty far. Which one is this? What? What? What number minute are you in? Oh, well first. Okay. So Paul to. Here's what you should see the ball. It actually the goal is to get the ball into the other side, but when you dog shit skills and so funny. I've just allowed me that when the person scores they get so hit so hard that no one wants to go. Like everyone's

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       like, no, you do it. You do it. Because as soon as you said

Speaker 4:          01:26:06       score, people just pummel you and then you see these guys in the corners with stretchers. They just carry people off the field the entire time. So this guy's holding this guy down. She could grapple to. Yes. The only rule you can bite, you can kick the ball. You can do anything. The only thing you can do is to, on one, that's the only rule you can bite. The only rule is no two on one. You can kick in the balls. I'm sure. I mean maybe that's like a general.

Speaker 1:          01:26:32       She is. Two guys are the only two guys that are humping were these two guys. This guy's got this guy's back and there's a lot of people fucking lolly gagging cherry pickers. You fucking pussies. Could they make get out there? And they're like, what the fuck am I doing? I have a family. Just knock these guys out one at a time. What the fuck are we doing here? Oh, that guy, oh, someone got smacked in the head. He goes down, he's got the ball and went down. Then another guy took his place in. Guys just sort of avoiding the whole thing. This ball guy looks gay as fuck. No, all. Oh, see, this is the guy gets knocked down. But look, as soon as he gets knocked down, another guy steps in and fights the guy that he was fighting before he got knocked down.

Speaker 4:          01:27:14       Oh, what a bizarre, stupid. Turns into just like a melee of madness and it's just, it's actually interesting to watch the clusters happen. Like the energy going into one place. Only one black guy. Yeah, I know.

Speaker 1:          01:27:27       That's why. That's why it's so boring. Nobody wants. And these guys, they're not professional professional athlete.

Speaker 4:          01:27:39       It's like they trained for it. Like it's, it's almost like a. what's that thing the iron man? It's like a voluntary thing that they do. It's tradition. If you do it, if your dad did it. Oh God. Yeah. So stupid. And so rediculus. Uh, but there's a lot of tradition in ed and see everyone wears like joker uniform.

Speaker 1:          01:27:59       Sure. What does that guys that are humping this still is bothered. Just like, you guys got this guys back, but he's not doing anything by the way. You should go out there when you're the commentary where all the black people, this guy's fucking gay to more buckeyes, getting happy now. They just took them off the bed. Another like maybe just a Sicilian. This guy's annoying. You've got dark shit skills. Well, it just seems like a. You mean a few of these guys are pulling people off going on.

Speaker 4:          01:28:28       See the yellow guys in yellow. That's when people get fucked up. Yeah. They just get taken off the field and then they have to play. I think it's 2:20 minute quarters and then the winter, the winters have to play again the next day again that three days in a row, the championship is four days later and the winning team, their prize is a cow. The Cow. You get a cow, a cow, get money. You don't get endorsed. The thing I like about it, that attracted me to it, there's no endorsement deals. There's no. Nothing's been promoted. It's just people that want to fucking fight each other.

Speaker 3:          01:29:03       What our stand is. Where's the leg kicks? Do you guys not understand about leg kicks? Italian. Yeah, but they're not. There's a few kicks being thrown, but Noah's Tony Lake kicks. They're standing right in front of each other, but there's no take downs. So there's no takedown tabs. It's just shitty boxing would the occasional kick.

Speaker 4:          01:29:19       It's this is. It's basically just like a giant street fight.

Speaker 3:          01:29:23       Right? But these guys have a little bit of skill. Like I'm looking at the way these. A lot of the legacy. Here's a takedown look at this, but nothing happens so you can take a guy down. But look at the way these guys are like standing in front of each other. Like chicken.

Speaker 4:          01:29:34       I think they probably get out there and like are like, wait, what am I doing? Let's just like pace around and see if we can just get through this 40 minutes without.

Speaker 3:          01:29:42       It's so weird because they just exchange partners. They move back and forth like they, they, they square off and then they decide I don't want to fight you. I'm going to fight your friend.

Speaker 4:          01:29:50       Well, it's so interesting because think about it. It's like these are not trained guys, but it's like if you put 20 people fighting, there's no pressure to do it right away, you know? It's like when do you decide it's time to take you to, you know, oh Jesus, this is this guy. But guy with the ball's going to go through. It's got to get through. Yeah. And then they're just talking shit like that.

Speaker 3:          01:30:11       You look at that kick, like how do you get. Does no one know how to kick?

Speaker 4:          01:30:15       No. I think most people, unless they're in Thailand probably don't. I went and saw those fights in Thailand. Doesn't want to watch those, but the point is there's less violence. So maybe your friend who is getting brain damage at his gym who has no business clown. Oh well Brian, Brian, if Brian didn't get box, I would be terrified at the things he was doing in the city. I think he needs to be in a gym getting punched in the face a couple of hours a day. It's good for the people at crossfit. No, I mean I'm not, I'm not negative about crossfit, but the kind of people who have to get that energy out, I worry where that energy would go if they weren't getting it out in competing or fighting or boxing or whatever.

Speaker 3:          01:30:56       That's valid. I think people feel better for sure when they have that sort of a release and I think there's a cathartic release and any sort of like severe exertion, but I think you can get the same cathartic release from Yoga. I really do. I really do. I mean it's not as this really exciting for a man. It's not as satisfying. It doesn't give you. This sort of. Channeling doesn't give you the confidence. Like Jujitsu is my favorite because you so you can go full blast and you get injured for sure, but it's not the same kind of injuries that you get usually from like kickboxing and stuff like kickboxing. Sparring to me is the most problematic because I've seen how hard some people can kick and I just know that if you zig when you should've zagged and someone decides to kick you harder and that fucking Shin bounces off your head. No, I just know what can be done. I've seen too much. So like when I see that I'm like, you are your bms. BMX jumping with no helmet. Okay. Hopefully you're going to anything.

Speaker 4:          01:31:50       The Jungle Java. It's just, it's not about if it's about when.

Speaker 3:          01:31:53       Yeah, well especially kickboxing. Kickboxing to me is like. I feel like even boxing is more. As long as you're sparring with people who you know are not going to hit you hard least you've got a little bit more control of this situation.

Speaker 2:          01:32:06       I mean I dunno. It really resonate or like was profound to me when you said that you know, you have to fall to know you're not your limitations, but you know, don't know how far ramifications you have to understand that when I broke my shoulder it changed my life. Like it was actually something that needed to happen because I've pushed myself way too hard. I had no respect for my body. Like I just routinely abused it with every, in so many ways, uh, the people I surrounded myself with, the things I ate, the way that I lived. I didn't sleep and it was like I needed to be proven the fragility of my body. Yeah. Vulnerability. Yeah, totally. Yeah. And being able to go, you know what? No, I don't think so. I think I'm going to try to think like more than two hours ahead right now and not do that dangerous thing.

Speaker 3:          01:32:50       Well, think about your body as if this longterm thing and people have given me a hard time about that too. Like go, like especially like lifting weights. I've been wondering why your body is so fucked up. Like [inaudible]. I'll put like a video on instagram of me working out my trainer, but that the only way you can keep your body from getting into sounds so counterintuitive. The only way that you can prevent certain injuries is by making your body strong. Of course, only way you can make your body strong as you gotta lift heavy thing.

Speaker 2:          01:33:17       I'm also. Do you have any interest or an hypermobility? Yes. Hypermobile. Hypermobile, which I didn't know, which means I lift things. Everything from a weight to a Coffee Cup with my joints, not my muscles. So I was using the term wrong then. I know maybe I am too, but it's um, so western European trash, which is, I am basically just like alcoholics with joint problems, like a lot of western European genetics means you're hyper mobile, which is useful. You're picking things up, putting a lot of strain on your joints. So when I pick something up, it's my knees and my hips and my lower back instead of my thigh muscles and my glue.

Speaker 3:          01:33:58       Well, that's one of the best things about Kettlebell training in my opinion, is that they're so awkward, but it forces you to understand how to use your body as a unit. There's a lot of people that do bodybuilding type workouts and the isolation exercises, although they make your muscles bigger. Yeah. They don't allow your body to synchronize and use itself as one individual. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:34:17       Interesting. That's how you get non collision injuries. Like when you hear about people who are 50 and they're like, I sneezed and threw my back out. That's because they've been putting pressure on their joints instead of their muscles for the longest time. And I didn't have an ass. Like I never use my glutes just walking around and walking upstairs and picking things up and whatever. And uh, and then I had to like relearn how to walk and Shit. I had to go to this fucking police thing and like it was so fucking boring. This was like three years ago was a fucking nightmare. Like literally, you know how to walk. You need to relearn how to walk and you're like sitting in bed. You can't sleep. Fuck, I

Speaker 6:          01:34:57       need to learn how to walk. I'm going to do a documentary. I'm going to write a book about how to walk. I'm going to learn how to walk. I'm going to get. I'm going to get fucking awesome it learning how to walk. I'm going to teach people how to walk. That's what I do. I'm going to go to China and teach kids how to walk. By the way, that's my schedule for tomorrow. Thanks. Thanks for reminding me. I mean you are one of those people, like when you call me, I say I'm doing a documentary on fucking horseshit. You walked over to them and if they lied to you, I know. We don't know what it's like to be a woman. We believe lies, so it's shit. Yeah, the world's flat. Your Dick is huge. There's a lot of lines going around it. But someone telling you.

Speaker 1:          01:35:38       Right. I was in a writers room once and I was like, thinking of this story where this, these characters were going to have sex, but then they didn't and I was like, oh, I have an idea. What if the guy is allergic to spermicide? And everyone was like, oh God. I was like, you know how like some guys are allergic to spermicide so they can't use condoms.

Speaker 6:          01:35:56       Yeah. It's like half of the guys I've dated guys,

Speaker 1:          01:36:02       I was like, they can't use condoms because there's so allergic to it. They were like, you are the dumbest. I was literally like at, as I was saying, and I was like, oh wow. Well I believe that some women are allergic to spermicide. Not only that, but I've heard that some women are actually allergic to different partners. Sperm. Interesting. I think that's true. Please Google sperm fertilizing eggs frozen. Then it's really bad reaction to our cooler. Something frozen eggs are fucking living an amazing life in Hermosa beach. They have a great view. It'll a fault. Yeah. Like, hey, keep them cold. I guess it's Cryo freeze. I should probably just keep them down. What if the power goes out? I think about that all the time. Greg goes down. Is that one of the things in the middle of the night that. No, they explained to me the generators and all this stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:36:53       All I ever think about is when I'm in hospitals. What if the fucking power goes out, know 33 and how many eggs did you store? Where your eggs are still good? Yeah, they're really good. Good. For like another six years. I just see an allergy ruined my marriage. Holy Shit. Fourteen months after we were married, I was diagnosed with humans seminal plasma hypersensitivity and allergy to seaman. I'm taking, oh my God, I met Simon at a girlfriend's wedding name changed to predict identity. The faithful day changed my life in more ways than I could've ever imagined. So I wonder if she's allergic to some dudes loads and not everyone's like, where is it in her? Is the allergy happening in her vagina or in her face? I just the that someone's wondering, but I just am curious where like a her throat itchy. Well, I wonder like what allergies guys have. Are some guys allergic to eating pussy? Okay. Sperm analogy sometimes seem analogy. Seminal. Plasma hypersensitivity is a rare allergic reaction to proteins. Founded a man's semen mostly affects women in the vaginal area. Oh, that's not good. Pain. Itching and a burning sensation of vaginal area. Oh, that's awful. Yeah, it sounds not good. Oh, that's a bummer. Mostly affects women. Why? Because mostly women catch loads.

Speaker 1:          01:38:09       Let me ask you something. Well, I'm always like, what's the evolutionary purpose of something? I mean, there's got to be an evolutionary purpose to every allergy. Is it? There's just eliminate people. Well, that's what I'm saying. Maybe evolution doesn't want this woman to procreate that way. It's random mutations and adaptations to environmental changes. It's what if this, if, if the, uh, yeah, hold on. They don't prove beneficial sample. Right? So, pheromones, if you're a fairmont smell good, that means we should procreate. Right? And if they smell bad it means we're probably related somehow. That's when. So to have a vagina flare up when sperm goes in, it is that nature's way of being like, this woman has garbage. Genetics may be the dude has weak loads. Maybe if a man has some like fucking stout loads get in there and your vagina. But like I'll tell you this.

Speaker 1:          01:39:00       This is good. This is good. Yeah. Maybe it's just bad loads, but that's your area. I don't know. I'm going to not cast. Was it Chris Ryan that was explained, explaining, write a book called about loads slow. It's going to be my new podcast forward by Brian. I'm just going to talk about load. Slept three hours twice a week, so I'm really interested in loans. We shouldn't have to do my first sexing actual sex next week. Yeah. And more. And let her literally. There's so much time and energy has gone into. Where does his Dick go? Where does, where does everything go? When is it for a t shirt? It's very shallow. So it's going to be a lot of people in the set. Yeah, I mean they'll probably minimize unnecessary people that day. Like you got a dude who was friends with who did a sexy with a girl and they're making out and she goes, if you want you could go ahead and fuck me.

Speaker 1:          01:39:56       And he was like, nope. It was like the moment you said that, the type of girl that says like, if you could fuck me a b movie, it wasn't even a b movie, you know, it's like some no name nonsense production. And they were, you know, making out. And she just said, you can go ahead and fuck. He's more. He likes them to say no more. Return on down. He can fuck me, please let me. Well, I bet he was probably terrified of not being able to get it up in front of all those peoples. Well, well, yeah, that's. I mean we were kind of trying to figure it out because we're like, okay, there's going to be an erection. Do we just might not be. You say there's going to be, but there might not be an erection if there's not one job, I will be crying hysterically that he will get loud because guys are into that during the crying.

Speaker 1:          01:40:43       Yeah. Yeah. I did an episode with Chris about this. Um, one time he was crying and the guy I was trying to interaction like red flag you like week with sad women. There are some people that have a hard time with someone who is not insecure. They're insecure. So if they're insecure and the woman is confident, they panic and then they could get, they could have a problem getting an erection. But if the woman like all of a sudden needs comforting and she's insecure, then they assume this position. Oh yeah. Interesting. So I should be brilliant. Secure. I will be anyway. Well, I don't know. Like what is like I was thinking about this the other day, there's two voices that are just absolute bullshit that just don't work, but we, we know them as archetypes and one of them is like, one of them is like the spooky voice, like no one's scared of this spooky and no ones. And then the sexy girl call one 800, suck my pussy. You know what I mean? Like that. Fuck, please don't ever stop. Got Anyone.

Speaker 1:          01:41:53       Everyone's different. But, but you know what I'm saying? It's like, you know, hey boys doing that doesn't work on anybody can do it. So men can. Men can pretend to be what I mean. Like I don't know any women who were like, well, you know what I mean, if you're just seeing those commercials, those late night phone call, commercial call, late night commercials at 2:00 AM or not guys like you that are guys who are probably more susceptive who are Beta males who need someone even more Beta than them. So maybe that's why they have to be like, but it's the naughty girl. Do you want to call Ashley Madison? Come? Yeah. It's like, why are you whispering? She wanted to be not. Well, maybe it's because they know that the wife's in the next room and friend. I'm like, Hey, just call fucking nine already. That's not sexy.

Speaker 1:          01:42:54       Not Suck my pussy. What the fuck is wrong with you? Why didn't you call me? He was like other archetypes, right? Like the Strip club, Dj voice, the top 40 Dj voice, those archives, the politician voice. That's an archetype, right? Annoying wife. Yes. Voice. Sure. I find myself in. I stopped doing this because I realized I'm exacerbating the problem. I get very triggered and annoyed by stereotypes. Like the stereotype that guys are dumb really annoys me and I dumb. No, I don't think guys are dumb. Guys are you're designed to only. Most people are. No, I just mean like in terms of why don't you remember my friend Audrey's name. You've met her three times. It's like guys are only really remembered designed to remember things if there's some kind of threat attached to it and it's just your brains are because like we're designed to sort of in a team way for me to be hypervigilant and be like, there's a fucking lion and you go break down everything to like some primitive tribe that is always think there.

Speaker 1:          01:43:49       People find things memorable because they're interesting and they're fascinating people. Things that are totally unthreatened. Is Andrea interesting or fascinating too? I don't know. Algeria, so maybe she is. She's cool as fuck. Yeah. Maybe Dr Audrey Ph day, but I just mean like some benign friend of your girl or whatever. Um, and got. I mean and then because it's also, that's something that I love about my, a man. Like if you're fixing something, I want you to only be focusing on that. Guys. Don't multitask in the same way. You know? I just think they call guys dumb. It's just as glorifying a neurotic multitasking, you know, overworked or glorification of busy type. That's the new thing. Guys that are just like simple. You know, I just. People are so varied though I'm really more hesitant to generalize. The older men or women are crazy. Men are stupid.

Speaker 1:          01:44:41       That thing is just to me, so I'm general. It's just a generalization that I think is really not helpful at all and annoying. It makes people comfort. It gives them comfort to sort of classify people. Totally. Yeah. Like you don't have to look at it. Oh, what happened with Debbie? She's a crazy bitch. It's like, it's easy to say she's a crazy bitch. Instead of say, well, I was raised kind of fucked up, but I really don't like her because she didn't, she wasn't heard his child secure stronger than I did and it's just, it's got. That'd be the dominant one. She's smarter than me on this too much already. Why did we get on that topic? There was something. Oh, the Beta males loads. We're talking about stop loads coming in hot load stone. It was something about the Beta males. Uh Oh. And the archetypes like dump because Oh, this is it. I've found in my stand up, I'd be like into. My boyfriend was like, Ooh, what are you doing? And I'm like, guys don't sound like that. What am I doing? You know? But it's funny. Point taken. Nevermind it. Sometimes I'll put a girl in my acts. I'd be like, yeah,

Speaker 6:          01:45:47       oh my God,

Speaker 1:          01:45:55       I know that girl exists.

Speaker 6:          01:46:00       Yay.

Speaker 1:          01:46:05       I just feel like a prime. Most species under attack, right?

Speaker 6:          01:46:09       So know how to walk. I pick things up with my joints, knees, and my back is just gonna like break and have extra bone in my foot. Hey God, I'm allergic to that and get it away from me, from my frozen eggs.

Speaker 1:          01:46:36       Freeze them with my eggs. I side just in case you can combine it. Some stories that all you need is come and eggs. You want to freeze an embryo, which means the, uh, the sperm fertilize. Say, Hey Joe, can I ask some of your sperm,

Speaker 5:          01:46:50       fertilize my, then put it in the freezer and then put it back in. My body seems so creepy. Zombie demands total science fiction embryo gets frozen and then you could turn that into life. But it only healthy choice dinner. Yeah. Yeah. But it only works like, okay. So an embryo will eventually become a human being, so that little embryo was already fertilizes. The egg gets fertilized and you could freeze that, but you can't freeze a 13 year old. Nope. No. What I'm saying know like there's a cutoff period. Should we could at some point just not yet. I think we could. Yeah, I think it's going to happen. I think these fucking [inaudible] guys, these assholes that are shooting stem cells and the DM people's heads, those fuckers

Speaker 4:          01:47:32       look lot of alive people who need that. But um, yeah, that is a crime I, I mean I imagined it because it doesn't have a brain and blood. It doesn't have to be warm. Like

Speaker 5:          01:47:42       Maria's not be warm. Humans I guess have to a certain body temperature. I mean, I mean that's like some Austin powers shit, but even a sell to me, I mean it was an individual cell. Like if the egg has been fertilized and the creative one sell the idea that you could freeze that fucking cell before it divides and becomes a full on human being. The idea that you could freeze that one cell and then regenerate it.

Speaker 4:          01:48:03       That was crazy. Honestly, I don't know how people do like, it's so. I guess that's why I tried to read so much yet because I'm like, I don't understand how I can't even understand what these people are doing and I'm not even doing it.

Speaker 5:          01:48:15       Well, it's so standard today too. I mean, which is so really fascinating because if you brought this concept to someone 200 years ago or even 100 years ago, they think you're out of your fucking mind, but it's, it sounds fucking crazy. It does sound like I'm sucking them out of your fucking over. I'm like, okay. Do you remember John and Kate plus eight? Of course. Remember that crazy lady. They shot the fucking those chemicals inside of her body to make her more fertile and she gave birth to six kids. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:48:44       Yes. OCTOMOM. Yeah. What the fuck? Optima optima have a lot of money. I think the only reason I remember that because people on twitter say I looked like her, uh, when they're just being mean. But uh, yeah, it's, I mean it's a, it I've never felt like more of a science project, you know, it's like the human body that kind of a miracle. But when he's this sort of intersection between technology and life or like mother nature is so weird. It's like he's in there and he's like with a wand and it says this with the soul and now you're going and what, uh, the, yeah, it's not a very sexy or romantic process. It's very clinical sort of rough and he's and in my ovaries are on a high def television. It's just like that for those two things to be in this like intersect. It's just so weird and you're just looking at all your follicles. And I was convinced for the first couple of sessions that it was just like a feed, like everyone saw the same feed because I was like, there's just no way you can see inside my body. Like, I mean

Speaker 1:          01:49:47       I just, I like, this is just a video tape you put in. Everybody comes in. It's the same thing. There's just no way you can see inside my body is dark on the inside obviously. Like I intellectually, I can't fathom it. Like it's just to, um, to have to. Obviously everybody is. I think it seems like all my follicles, he's like, this one's a different size. I'm like, how the fuck do you know that it looks like a haunted house to me. I can't understand anything. It looks like paranormal activity. I mean it looks like a fucking nightmare. And uh, and then I go and then I'm sure enough you get like four. I looked like I was like four or five months pregnant, you know, and I'm doing these shots every day and I'm like, it was like, this is so fucking crazy. So it makes your stomach stick out more because I had 18 big swollen ecs.

Speaker 1:          01:50:33       Yeah, I have a picture of it somewhere. I'll send it to you and I look like five months pregnant and it's just like, Whoa, you know, it's usually caused for our alarm. So to spend money to look like that. And then, uh, yeah. And then you go in and they suck them all out. Now what made you decide to do that? You know, like one day have a kid, I am going to one day have a kid. What he said to me was this, he was like, look, because I was like, I know my next year and a half, two years it's gonna be a little bit hectic and I'm probably not going to get. He was like, this might not be for your first or second kid. It could be a for your fourth. Like when you're 44 and you're like, you don't have to have one more.

Speaker 1:          01:51:07       Or like I'm going to have a surrogate, you know? Oh Jesus. It was literally just like an insurance policy. A adopting. It depends. So adopting is a kind of a nightmare. A lot of my friends have been going through it. You sign up for it and you're waiting for the baby to be born and the mother might change their mind. So the mother has, I think two days to decide whether she wants to keep the baby or not after she gives birth. And that's of course when her brain is fade and oxytocin after having it and a lot of couples go down to nine month journey and don't get a kid. But if you do it from a different country, it's a little different of a couple of gay friends. The hard surrogate. What is it, a surrogate surrogate even for gay people? Yeah, I guess they use their own come.

Speaker 1:          01:51:46       I don't know. I think just a cooler shot it into a Turkey based. It had to have been one or the other. I don't think they knew. Anyway, they paid this woman for the last 150 grand. They paid her for a year and then when the baby was born she decided to keep it. No, that's the. That's the lawyers fault. There must've been something. She's decided to keep it. I don't think you could force a woman to. You might be able to force her to give the money back or some of the money back. Well, you could sue for the money back, but I don't know the. You could take the baby away. That's insane. In California, the mother has. I think all the rights, I think once the baby comes out of her body, she's probably like, well listen, that's my fucking baby. How do you want to make this work? Yeah, I mean it's really a total chemical bonding thing. We'll also. The might've been like some severe desperation in her life that made her take this position as being a surrogate mother in the first place and the money gave her. Might have alleviated St Louis problems that were causing

Speaker 5:          01:52:46       her to be so desperate that she wanted to have a surrogate baby. That's very interesting problems. Dark for them. It was like really breaking. It was heartbreaking, but it was also like, wow, well it's all so fucking baby. I mean, she grew in her body like

Speaker 2:          01:52:59       logically. So have, you know, friends with surrogates and and you. It's very stressful because you want to micromanage what they're eating if they're sleeping. But something that was helpful that I learned was that if a baby's not getting the nutrients it needs it, we'll take it from his mother's bones. So if you're a surrogate is eating McDonald's, your kids

Speaker 5:          01:53:17       be fine. You're the carrier. Is the one that's going to suffer a little parasites just sucking and fucking suck calcium out of your

Speaker 2:          01:53:26       babies? Totally. They suck up brain cells from the mother to. I mean, they're fucking vampires. So dominant.

Speaker 5:          01:53:33       Ten percent of their. No, they're just tired all the time, I think is what it is. They're duplicating. I mean it's like, it's a metamorphosis. It's like a fucking piss. A lot of work, but a nightmare. Yeah. It's just crazy that that's the energy. It's the ultimate buyer of traffic. The thing that we look forward to the most, the thing that sells cars and fucking TV shows, long legs and sax and hate. And what is it really? It's about coming in someone and making a person in their body. I mean, it's really like this ultimate biological trick of replication. Do you, uh, have you ever heard of this book called. It's a stupid name, but cubits poisoned arrow. It's about what orgasms do to your brain and the whole sort of theory is to not have an orgasm unless you're going to actually procreate because of the chemicals that are released.

Speaker 5:          01:54:21       It's, it's, I don't know who wrote that book. What kind of monster? Yeah. Sex addicts that. No, that's the best way to clear your mind is to shoot a load. I know, but it's something about your golf and your thought process is so much clear. Like there's so many times that I've told my friends like, you know what? I wanted to do mood. She's pressuring me. Jerk off first. Then think about it. Just go jerk off man. Tell me after you jerked off, if you want to deal with all this emotional bullshit that's being thrown at you.

Speaker 2:          01:54:49       Um, hold on. Will you, I'll send this to you. I remember reading it and while I was reading I was like, yeah, this makes a lot of sense. I mean, I don't want to live like that, but it makes a lot of sense. Well, it's something about how if you want to stay in love with someone long term, because if you have too many orgasms, if you produce dopamine and then after, because essentially we're designed to procreate like you said, and then the female starts producing oxytocin, but the mail starts being less interested in the brain is like, okay, now you have to go procreate with someone else because our brain doesn't know that are 6 billion people on the planet and that we don't need to fucking broke rate with a lot of different moms. Uh, so it's something about if you want to be in a relationship for a long time. So it's like a tantric type thing. It kind of, you know what, I'll send it to you. It's like it's basically about. I stopped reading after like four pages, so I was like, I'm never going to fucking is. It's about keeping Oxytocin, the bonding chemical alive with couples. Oh, that's crazy. So they're trying

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       to hack couples. Yes they are. That's ridiculous. How much does find someone that you actually like, that's too easy,

Speaker 1:          01:55:50       but it's Kinda in La. Is that possible? Of course. Can Be done everywhere. Who would you be doing? Who Do I think you should do? I don't know. We'll find somebody. We need to find you. Somebody. I'm dating somebody, but it's not working out obviously. I'm just curious. Who Do you think I should date? Curious. Like I've cure. I'm just curious. I'm curious. You're a. You always have interesting balance. I think the person I'm dating

Speaker 3:          01:56:18       that idea but I'm sure a lot so I think and I mean that in the best way, but you're very smart and you're very ambitious and you're. You're interested in a lot of different things and you have to have someone who is similar in some ways, nightmare. You know, that know someone that I honestly believe that in order for someone like you because I think you're an outlier in a lot of ways in that you're a liar, liar. That outlying aspect of your personality because you're. I think you have to. Someone has to be an outlier in some way of their own in order for them to appreciate you because otherwise they're just gonna think like, I can't keep up with this crazy bitch. This is too much, you know, she, she doesn't sleep, she gets up in the middle of night, starts writing books and learn how to walk again. It's like, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          01:57:09       Yeah. I'm like the guy, the grandpa from Charlotte and of bed.

Speaker 3:          01:57:13       Well there's a lot of benefits to your type of behavior. Obviously. That's why you're so successful. It's a lot of benefits to what you think, but the negative side aspect of it though, the where I would say it's going to be problematic is someone has to like for companionship. Someone has to be able to keep up with you or understand you or accept you and what the way you think and the way you approach life is extremely different. It's not the way most people do it and not the way most women do it for sure. And if men are used to this certain type of patterns that some women follow and then you have this pattern, you know, they're going to be like, oh, it's just, I don't want. I just want to grow. Complains about starbucks, you know,

Speaker 1:          01:58:08       coconut milk, camel milk, what do we do it and goat's milk.

Speaker 3:          01:58:11       I think, you know, when I hate saying stupid shit that people repeat, but I think this, this repeated thing is when you're ready, you'll find something. Yeah, that's. Yeah, you're right. Because I. and I think there's like. I think a relationship really doesn't work unless you yourself are ready for a relationship too. That's a really good point. You have to be someone that someone would want to be in a relationship with it all the time. I'm like, how about stop focusing on the other

Speaker 4:          01:58:41       person? What I want to date me once I get into a place where I would want to date me or marry me. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:58:48       And people think they're going to find someone, a person is going to calm them down and then they're going to be someone that's worth dating. Yeah. That's often calm yourself down, right? Solve your own problems and then. Yeah. Yeah. Hold on. I've been fucking song and dance for the first couple weeks of the relationship until like a buddy of mine had this girl that he was dating for a while and then his car broke down and he needed her to help him. Like he, his tire blew out and uh, I forgot the whole story, but she helped him in some sort of a way. Like she came and got him or something like that. And then she stayed over the house and then the next day she texted him like five fucking times in a row and he didn't text her back and then she left. That's crazy message about now she's going to need therapy and she has trust issues. And so it was like, just what the fuck he was working all day. He's like, I'm just working all day. I had one day where I tried to put my phone aside and concentrate on my work and you're just blowing up my fucking phone and I didn't text you back. Now you need therapy. Like there's certain people that you enter into any sort of an intimate relationship with them and you're taking on the burden of all this,

Speaker 4:          01:59:54       which is exactly why I all this self shed. Maybe it comes up super masturbatory and like narcissistic, but I was like, I'm done being crazy. It's not crazy by saying I'm done being crazy. That's crazy. But here's the thing, I don't it. It's cute in your twenties. It's not cute in your thirties to text a guy five times in a row. I don't want lack of awareness. I do not. Exactly. So I want to be able to go, oh, this is my shit. This has nothing to do with him. Like I have abandoned terror and data and like solve my accounts. Terror, terror. It's called abandonment. That expression before infant maternal disruption. So I have a band Materra, which means I didn't hit the brakes, were always in here and it doesn't. As soon as we start winding down, I'd throw out some shit like that. Like sperm allergy, environmental disruption.

Speaker 4:          02:00:44       What's going on with your foot? Nice talking. I can't get my fucking tesla. Get outta here. No. Uh, when you didn't get enough eye contact as a kid, basically you have infant maternal disruption, like you weren't able to get the connection. So when, um, when you don't get a text back or whatever, it starts triggering really old abandonment terror. Oh Wow. Yeah. So that girl is broken like something happened from the ages of one to three that now is manifesting in five text messages, you know, but you have to get control of your own shit. You got to clean up your own yard. You got to fix it. That's why I'm in 12 step programs. I'm in, I do Emdr, I'm in a fuck. I'm on all sorts of shit because I'm just like, I'm not gonna just be a puppet of this. What happened to me when I was three for the rest of my life and I'm not gonna punish the guys. I date for it. It's not your fault, but even talking about as punishment. Well, I don't. So in pro and I know that we're not even dating and me talking about, it's like

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       instrument to me so fast with me. So in program we don't go to the problem for the solution, so it's like if the problem is you're not texting me back, I'm not going to go to you and say, Hey, text me back, I'm going to go figure out the solution and then take the solution to the problem, to the relationship. Well I'm a big believer in the path of least resistance when it comes to relationships. And if someone doesn't want to text you back, you probably shouldn't be hanging out with them. It's pretty simple. So like to like chase after people. It's an instinct. People have it like God, why didn't they call me back? But a lot of us. How come you didn't text me back? You fuck a lot. I guess we're not texting back and visit a Sikh people whose approval we don't have her whose attention we don't have because we didn't get it or why I think text messages and even voicemail messages in a, in a way or weird in that like you send somebody something and then you wait for them to respond and you hold and the like, all right, come on out there.

Speaker 1:          02:02:32       What do we got here? It's like send a raven to fucking scroll attention because it's like if I text, you know, text me back and then I see that you posted an instagram. There's this whole fucking thing. Which did happen the other day. Joe, now Joe Jogi definitely. But there's this new thing of how I can see all the other things you're doing on your phone instantly. So I'm now all of a sudden like, well you fucking responded to three's these tweets, you know, stock from fucking Ronda, but you didn't text me back. It turns into that shotgun, Rhonda. So I'm not going to start with her. Love her very much. Which one you're talking about? Oh, oh, have the doctor. Rhonda. Rhonda Rousey Rousey, I thought you were just making people's names. Oh No, no. I just was trying to think of someone who you might tweet with it or tweet about or something.

Speaker 1:          02:03:26       Um, but uh, but yeah, so now I think with all of these other things, it makes things, it makes it harder to just solely focus on the purity of did he text me back or not? It's like he didn't text me back, but he did all these other things on his phone. It was just human beings enter into relationships. Even friendships like. And when I say relationship, I don't mean sexual, just like any time that you're relating to other people, it's the person that you're hanging around with. They change how you are like you, you are who you are. You have like this base and then you might be lighter around certain people or friend. Totally. There's like a chemical reaction that you have to people's personalities. Instantly. When I see a comic I stopped trying to be funny. It's the best thing. Like I, I'm not like don't ever make jokes, but as soon as I'm going to comment, I'm like, ah, I don't have to try to make you laugh. Oh, okay. So you feel like when you're around people that aren't comics, like you're almost obligated because I know you're funny. Yeah. It's like your thing about, it's just different reactions. Certain people trigger different things and it's like that may be your own expectations of what you think people want to be. Could be or it's like the performance or the show or the costume I put on to avoid intimacy or to having to really connect to somebody. Do you think that like with every day in

Speaker 5:          02:04:38       every hour and every time you obsessed and all these things and all these different paths that you go down, like every day gets a little better every day, get a little better at it, get a little better at life.

Speaker 4:          02:04:47       Yes, yes. And if I haven't, I'm like, you know, but it depends on also what comes up because it's like, you know, sometimes you're like fucking nailing it and then a trigger comes along and you're like, I didn't even know that was a trigger that was weird, you know, or like a totally new stimulus. Dynamic comes along. The instagram is invented. Like I'm nailing it with guys they can, they don't have to text me back. I feel great. And then they put up my shit now instagram was fucking invented and now I have to see what they're doing and that I have to compare, you know? So it's like, it's, our environments are changing so fast. It's hard for our sort of emotional and mental progress to keep up with all these new sort of curve balls unless you turn your phone block and should off just all like have you ever.

Speaker 4:          02:05:31       Oh yeah. If I have to put so like a chastity belt on my phone, I like, it's, I, I have to protect and when I drive I have to put in the backseat because I will text and drive in the back seat. I put it in the back seat because I don't trust myself because I literally will just look, I'll just be driving and I'll look down and all of a sudden I'm on my phone. I'm like, what the fuck? This is so dangerous. It's so you go unconscious. Yeah. And I rear ended somebody like. And it wasn't like email. I literally just looked down at my phone. I was like pulling up to a stop sign and I thought I was stopped and uh, you know, they say that uh, uh, texting is now worse than drunk driving. More people die from texting and driving and driving and I don't even think it's, I just, yeah, I just think it's not going to happen to me. I don't know what magical fucking addict thinking I'm doing, but I literally will just like look down at my phone and I ran into this guy and I was like, I'm so sorry. Totally my fault. And I was like, that's going to be my rock bottom. It wasn't bad at all. It was like a little ding and I was okay. That needed to happen. I need,

Speaker 5:          02:06:26       don't you think that your ideas of what is going to happen or based on what's already happened and nothing's happened yet, so you assume, well, I'm in the car, I'm driving. Nothing happens when I'm driving, I'm finding the valley. What's the,

Speaker 4:          02:06:37       what am I going to die in a car accident. I mean it's like, that's not the story I wrote for myself, but no one gives a fuck about that. No one has that script, right? Everyone's isn't. Everyone isn't running around, you know, trying to make sure I stay alive

Speaker 5:          02:06:49       and that brings it all back to like you go into Vietnam and you experiencing of another possibility that like you or I were both really lucky they were born in America, were born white, wealthy people in America too. I mean not born it but you know, I wasn't either but we're lucky. We're lucky as fuck. Like this situation with this situation wasn't possible. Literally live in Vr.

Speaker 4:          02:07:11       I feel like what I realized is like know because when everyone's like, I'm tired. Like everyone's like this. Just like people love being sick to love it. They fucking love it. I don't feel good. I have a headache. I have this. I have a thyroid thing. When you think about having sicknesses are just distractions though, right? Lyme disease or whatever. The fight if you really. Lyme disease. I'm so sorry. Tim Ferriss. So sorry. But I mean, is lyme disease? He had it. Yeah, it was like, I think really bad. Um, but like, I mean everyone's like, I'm tired. I think I have lyme disease. I'm like no, people really have lyme disease or people are like, I'm allergic to gluten. I'm like, do you have celiac disease? Are you, do you just need to be sick because it gets you attention, like you know, and then you go to a place where people are actually saying and actually have problems and it just, it just really changes your perspective. Did you ever see that Louis C K bit about being white? Probably, but it makes me think of the one cause I, cause I was thinking this isn't a bit I do obviously, but I just remember after being in Vietnam, I was like, we should just walk around all the time. It'd be like, that's awesome. This is so cool.

Speaker 4:          02:08:20       Like we should. It should just constantly be like, oh my God, this is water in this bottle.

Speaker 5:          02:08:25       He has this amazing bit where he's like, you could go back to any time in history and it would be amazing. He's like, that's the thing about being white and it's like being white is great. He goes, you can go back 200 years ago. You don't have to worry about being a slave is like

Speaker 4:          02:08:40       just white people. Irish people didn't have it so good for awhile. While there's definitely some mean it's a joke, but take that low. What about the Irish found little debunking your bit, but he also. That thing about everything is amazing and all we do is complain about the, about the flying and people. Like my flight was $45.

Speaker 5:          02:08:59       I went on this hunting trip in Prince of Wales Island, which is in Alaska and it's unbelievably rainy. I mean we were just drenched for six days and I just thought in my head for some reason that you'd be dry when you get in the tent. I'd be like, well, once you get the tech, it'd be dry, but you never really get dry because the air is wet and there's mist everywhere, so everything's wet. You're sleeping bags soaking wet. The only thing that saves you and keeps you warm is the fact that you're wearing wool. Wool retains body heat even when it's wet. Unlike cotton and a lot of synthetic fabrics don't do it. Oh, interesting. But wool is amazing. It's an animal, right? Yeah, an animals. Exactly. So like when you have wool socks on, even if your feet are wet, you're still warm. Wool is. The Shit is just so important for people that are in the outdoors, like wool undergarment probably. I think wolves get them more than the cold,

Speaker 4:          02:09:53       but I mean. Oh, good point. Okay, got it. Sorry. I was like, I thought you meant wolf hair. I was like, wolves have. Whoa, whoa. That's their. Their hair is a wall. Sorry.

Speaker 5:          02:10:01       Point was that, um, so six days in this soaked environment, just every day, just being just completely wet, everything's wet. Everything you do is what your face is like. A sheen that you could feel it on you, it's like you're just wet and cold and that came back and it was sunny and it was 80 and I was like, this is amazing. And I was driving around in La and I'm like, I love it here. It's so. And I called my friend Steve. Same Guy, Steven Alan. I called him up and I go, dude, I am so fucking happy. I've never been this happy, but it's because I was miserable for those. It's so important

Speaker 4:          02:10:34       to have it. Every shade it. Yes, I was in, in Vietnam, like I said, they wear masks. I went for a run with this motherfucker. Who back to your point about flat feet. He's like the marathon guy who was like, you're supposed to run barefooted. Right? So he's barefoot run guy and this was the first non barefoot Ron who's done because it was in Vietnam and there's just like, you shouldn't last nightmare and just dead animals. It was dysentery. Just babies by the way. Also just kids everywhere. I'm like, do you have a parent? Like, I mean, there's just like three year old toddlers just running businesses can literally like, excuse me, like, do you work here like you literally will do, so I'll send you some of the photos. You'll see a kid just at a store alone and you're like, what is avenue? So fucking dangerous and uh, and everyone's in mass,

Speaker 2:          02:11:21       they can't breathe the oxygen there. And we went for a run and I came back and I felt like I had smoked four packs of cigarettes and I came back to La. And even just doing that was like a little mini miracle.

Speaker 3:          02:11:33       Did you ever see that? There's a story that was written about Mark Zuckerberg who was in China and he went for a run during like one of the worst days, one of the worst pollution days. And he's out there jogging around and you know, you look at the air behind them, it's like, Ugh, you're jogging into like an exhausting

Speaker 2:          02:11:49       pipe. Could he did, he just doesn't see. I mean it's, it's hard.

Speaker 3:          02:11:54       Can you wanted to experience it because, you know, just to know. I mean, he's an interesting guy. I mean, he's obviously very thoughtful guy and I think that maybe he wanted to experience it was just because

Speaker 4:          02:12:05       just to know those people, I can pay for it. Whatever happens to me so we can get new lungs, I'll just get some fucking stem cells to regenerate Brianna Mahon, my lungs. But uh,

Speaker 2:          02:12:16       but yeah, I mean, and that's the, I think. And I also like, once you see that kind of pollution, it's like, you know, because it's, there's so many charities and there's so many fucking problems. You can't try to solve all of them or be, you know, such a small part. But I was like, oh, this is the first time that I was like, I needed like only Dubai, you know, there's like carbon neutral companies and companies that, you know, put less emissions out and stuff and you're like, yeah, I should start voting with things I buy. And you know, it's the first time I got this app that tells you what companies don't emit as much pollution, you know, stuff like that. And I'm like, I never really thought about that before until I was breathing in like viscous toxic air. Well,

Speaker 3:          02:12:52       it's interesting because just being a human being, just by the nature, the nature of our existence, we consume constantly and we're constantly using things that are detrimental to the environment and people will concentrate on certain things. Like, Hey, I ride my bike everywhere. So my carbon footprint is less. Yeah, but you're still using plastic motherfucker. That shit goes into garbage. Totally, totally. Wastes refilling. What are those called? The landfills to landfills. They wind up getting into the ocean, like all the stuff that we do has an effect all of it. 100 percent. Like this idea that you're immune because you ride your bike everywhere or because you have an electric car. That one drives me fucking crazy because by the way, those electric cars, those fucking minerals, those cards has apparently. Cause they are not recyclable right now. Well, not only that, their conflict minerals, a lot of the batteries, they're getting the minerals from places that are like, they're there.

Speaker 3:          02:13:47       There's a real issue with where they're getting this, these minerals to make these batteries like that's one of the big things about Afghanistan, like one of the big things about Canada and they found trillions of dollars worth of lithium in the, in the mountains and they believe it's one of the reasons why we're there in the first place. There's, there's all sorts of. There's all sorts of natural resources that the Soviets wanted out of Afghanistan. The natural gas pipeline. It's one of the main reasons why they believe that some of the neo-cons we're very interested in protecting and invading Afghanistan is not just the poppy business, which is huge. Look, it's a giant fucking business and the idea that, well, we wouldn't have anything to do with that because it's not illegal or because it's illegal. Well, that's not true because if you look at what happened in Vietnam, Vietnam, a big part of the reason why people were in Vietnam, why some people supportive being in Vietnam is because they were profiting off controlling the heroin trade.

Speaker 3:          02:14:44       That's a fact. There was a fucking trillion dollars made during the Vietnam War from heroin sales and where it was made and why and who got the money and where the corruption took place and where the money was being handed out. That's all open to speculation and research and maybe someone will eventually have it all figured out one day, but the reality is there was a massive amount of fucking heroin that was being moved. Whoa, Jesus Christ. I'm getting crazy heroin. Nothing happened. I got lucky dude. So like that. Your coffee is made of like coconut oil and butter that it's like white barely move your coffee. It's like, it's like, it's like lava. It's thick plastic like my stout loads, but my point being that these batteries that they're making these fucking car batteries out of there. It's like Afghanistan sits on $1,000,000,000,000 in minerals. You're telling me that they're not there partially for that or that someone is not looking at that as saying like, hey, maybe we should figure out how to suck those fucking minerals out of the ground and make a trillion dollars.

Speaker 3:          02:15:53       Like the idea that we're not. It's crazy the idea that that's not a part of the equation is utter complete nonsense and I think that the amount of minerals that are in these fucking car batteries is something we really need to look at because I was reading this whole piece about conflict minerals and how non-green electric cars actually are. Have you stop and look at it like. Yeah. As far as like our environment. Yes, for sure. They definitely pollute our environment less, but if we look at the actual repercussions of creating these things, like how are these minerals being sourced? How are they these batteries? What, what are the, what's the adverse effects of creating these batteries? It's not clean and free. So people run around saying, I drive my electric car and you know, and uh, I only eat organic and so I'm free of any

Speaker 1:          02:16:44       know you're free of bullshit. You're free of your own, your own bullshit gal because. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:16:48       But business being a fucking human, being a human, you're using things were consumed. Yeah. We should all consume less, most certainly, but like even people will only vegetables and grains, God damn large scale green operations destroy massive amounts of wildlife, habitat, displaced animals killed. Those grain combines are completely indiscriminate. They chew up rodents and fucking deer fawns and ground nesting birds and forget about insects.

Speaker 1:          02:17:16       Can you get me started on the bees

Speaker 3:          02:17:18       bugs? Just bugs alone. I mean, what do we have a hierarchy of what we will and won't allow being killed. We have these ideas well, well like animals exhibit fear and emotions and react to our environment so we shouldn't kill them. But bees or insects like a mosquito. Well that's a different thing because that's life but it's not

Speaker 1:          02:17:41       no fees. It's like be the source of everything but like mosquitoes, mosquitoes, mosquitoes carry diseases and they checked the. Yeah, they mosquitoes make sure the population stays low, but arguably like insects are probably one of the best sources of protein that we could ever get stalled. I felt like there was an insect protein movement happening and it just sort of.

Speaker 3:          02:18:06       Well, I think it's a perception issue because I think a lot of people have the idea that one, when I was in Mexico recently, they they serve crickets like the hotel we were at. They will. They have these like they look like they're stir fried

Speaker 1:          02:18:18       crickets and they left him in our hotel room. It was like a snack was covered with Saran wrap. Nobody ate it, but me, of course I fucking fear factor you guys. It was literally eating, but you've seen all that, but they all ate them like regularly there they were eating these because it's like we'll eat snails lead frog legs. It's like, well there is a very weird line. Maybe in our line is different than like the Yulin dog festival line. Don't we can talk about that. Fascinating. But yeah. But when I was in A. Yeah, in Vietnam, the stuff that they was like jellyfish and squared, it was a lot of, I guess what's available in that region. It's probably 100 percent, but yeah, there was so much more. Uh, we feel like a meeting, a jellyfish, willing to them. They're just sucking jellyfish. I know

Speaker 3:          02:19:04       bugs to me are really a fascinating thing because one of the things that we found out when we were doing fear factor is that our ge, so like if you have an allergy to certain shellfish, you also have an allergy to Roaches,

Speaker 1:          02:19:14       Huh? Yeah. So, uh, we found that out the hard way lawsuit. But bugs

Speaker 3:          02:19:23       are an excellent source of protein and people don't have the same emotional attachment

Speaker 1:          02:19:28       to a bug, but we have a visceral negative reaction like repulsion to them. Right? But if they did something but it was ground up in some sort of a protein peddling cricket protein is real. You've ever cricket bar now? Protein bars are good. Oh, here we go. Look at this. Expo crickets. The future of protein, soy, dairy, grain and gluten free. Paleo and environmentally friendly. Yeah. I'll eat the shit out of some crickets. Do they taste like anything bad? It just tastes like soy protein or something. It's not like you're eating lobster, but it's not like you're eating shit.

Speaker 1:          02:20:05       Cricket bars. It's not like you're eating lobster, but I wonder. It's not like you're eating shit because there's the ultimate debate. There's a lot of people that are like really strict vegetarians and they're not eating vegan because they want to leave the least amount of footprint possible. I totally understand all those, but I wonder how they would feel about crickets. I wonder how they feel about perception issue, you know? Well it isn't. It isn't. You know what I mean? We perceived dogs to be cute and Catia Labor. So when we perceived crickets to be like gross and dirty, but like, but it's there and they're still alive. When would you be willing to eat a bug? Like if you're not willing to eat like a deer, would you be willing to eat a bug, you know, gets a live bug. No dead bug. Like someone like maybe someone who's vegetarian and they do it for ethical reasons or they have a concern about being about bugs.

Speaker 1:          02:21:00       They don't have a lot of meat. So I feel like I'm eating just a little skeleton. I feel like it's eating a scale. I feel like I'm meeting a skeleton and not like a meat that I can sort of disassociate from their head. That's fucked up skeleton. When you grind that shit up, it's actually pretty high in protein. No, it's both. I mean, yeah, but there's something. There's something just kind of Ooh, ugly about it, but I also think that we're. Sorry to bring this back to the way we're trying. I think that were designed to squirm and bugs because everyone's squirms at bugs because I think they carry diseases, poison and more than diseases, so we're evolved to go to bugs, which has probably saved a lot of our lives. You know that we're not running around eating them since there, other than lyme disease and malaria.

Speaker 1:          02:21:42       Malaria is a giant one. Of course. What else does carry what other diseases who are allergic to bees? Wass. Sure. Stuff like that. There's spiders, black widow, spiders or those are poisons. Oh yeah, sorry. Seizes lyme disease. A big one. Malaria's the biggest malaria has killed a fuckload of people. Yeah. I have a buddy's got malaria right now for the second time. CICA and should not seek out. What was the one before that? What was the one who. How do you say it? Did you say Zika? Is it whatever it is. I watched. I saw it on Fox News so I wouldn't go to Mexico because of it. But they're scared. There's. What's the other one that was before that? Not Anthrax. It was just tap. Ebola was. That was that. That's from spit isn't a

Speaker 5:          02:22:26       monkey. Somebody fucked a monkey. Someone to talk to her. That's right. Always. Monkeys. Diseases. The diseases that come from bugs. Oh boy. There's a lot of foot and mouth or what's I'm a look at this one. Chaga is disease and look at the vector. Various assassin bugs, fever, lung, heart or mucus membranes. Symptoms. What the fuck's in assassin? Bug. Have you ever heard of a mild symptoms and chronic heart or brain inflammation? What the fuck? Mild relative of the Ninja bug. Whoa. Plague the flea is subfamily of a try. A total fucking assholes. Assholes do not give a shit. Well, they're the biggest, um, biggest argument for decreasing deer population and also intrigued reintroduction of predators. In the summer areas, like some people are talking about like bringing in a coyotes and wolves in a certain area like saved yellowstone. The reintroduction of wolves didn't really, oh, that's a very controversial subject.

Speaker 5:          02:23:38       The shape of the river, that guy that said that, that guy who made those amazing videos, the wolves changed the course of that guy, George to build, I think his name is. I forget how to say his last name. He's fucking crazy. Really in a good way, but it's like when I found out the coney guy was like a pedophile. That crazy guy, that guy. He was super depressed and was like suicidal I guess, and was was in his midlife and was wondering what's the purpose of life? And got fascinated by the concept of rewilding. He got fascinated by this reintroduction of predators, keystone predators, and to areas like yellowstone, which they definitely have their purpose and they're definitely important to the health of the environment. The, the weaker of the thing. The problem with things like wolves is they can get overpopulated as well and someone needs to manage them and that's where things get weird.

Speaker 5:          02:24:36       So wildlife biologists have established these guidelines when biologists, but for humans, so who nobody was chaos. Chaos. First of all, there was a lot of different animals here. We're talking about like 10,000 years prior. There was all these different kinds of animals like the short face bear, short nose or short face bear. There was an enormous bare. There was a step lion that existed in America like a long time ago that was way bigger than the African lion. There was all these birds and fucking crazy predators, terror birds. So we'll. We'll go back. Thousands and thousands of years. Even like millions, like when the when bulls first and there's a bunch of different kinds of wolves and some wolves like the gray wolves. They left and left North America and migrated across the bering strait and then the red wolves and some of the other wolf stayed. That's why those wolves, those are the ones that interbreed with coyotes, but coyotes is actually a wolf or a coyote is a kind of wolf or coyote is what's called.

Speaker 5:          02:25:36       They used to call them prairie wolves. It's, ah, there's a guy name Dan Flores who has this amazing paper that he wrote called Bison Ecology and bison diplomacy and I'm really groundbreaking paper on Bisons and livestock and the wild animals rather, that live in North America and lived in North America, but he wrote this new book on coyotes, coyotes, and just what the planes used to be like this. Why this George Guy, this antibiotic guide or say his name is. Yeah, the wolves change rivers. Guys, he wants to reintroduce megafauna to Europe like lions because he's saying that at one point in time, lions and hyenas used to live in Europe and that we could use these are large segments of unused land and let these animals loose and reintroduce them to this area. He's out of his fucking mind. Sounds like a horrible idea. Well, it's, it's, it's engineering, so he doesn't want to just take an animal that was extra painted because of human intervention.

Speaker 5:          02:26:38       Right? Wolves were taken out of the wolves were poisoned. Well, this is what they used to do. These to take a carcass. They would shoot a buffalo and while the animal is still like barely alive, they would inject strychnine into it's, it's, uh, it's arteries and that way it would the poison we get through all of the meat. Then they would take a wolf that they shot and they would rub it set all over this carcass so that the wolves knew that other wolves had been there. So it was safe. They knew it was dead, it was a dead carcass. So they would eat it and they would kill them and they almost extinguished. Wolves almost like came really close to extinction wolves in North America. They couldn't do that with the coyote though the coyotes are too fucking smart. They're too clever because clever. Well, it's because of wolves. It's because the gray wolves, when they returned to North America, they were killing coyotes. So the red wolves were interbreeding with coyotes, but the gray wolves were killing them. So the coyote learned to adapt to the gray wolves. So they learned to move to the furthest areas. They also want. You hear coyotes yelling. Yeah, they're doing a roll call the trinity. And when they find out that someone's missing, it triggers the females to have larger litters.

Speaker 4:          02:27:48       What? Yeah. So

Speaker 5:          02:27:50       I got it. I want to send you this podcast, this podcast with Dan Flores. It's going to blow your.

Speaker 4:          02:27:56       I hate coyotes burrowing in my yard. And I have dogs. Yeah. So I had, I mean I woke up, they had dens they made dens in, in the back of my yard because I have like land and then I have this part up top that don't really go up that much. And my dog used to just come back with fucking like half plate. I was like, what is going on up there? I think what she did, I think that she's up to now. Um, one's even bigger, but one's a pit bull. I think what she did was she would chase one and then it will go under

Speaker 2:          02:28:22       the. Because you realize the vampire they can fly. I mean they can, they can clear Julie's to get a coyote fence in your yard. It has to go three feet into the ground in seven feet tall. They can, they can jump.

Speaker 5:          02:28:32       I've seen it. I actually stole my chicken and I want you to jump over the fence with chicken and rice.

Speaker 2:          02:28:37       The coyote stole a baby and I think Arizona off of the porch. I mean, they're fucking barbarians. And uh, the by two encounters one time I, they were drinking out of my pool and I came outside and I literally opened the door and they just looked at me like, what? Whoa. I had to chase them. Okay. And I saw one jump over my fence. I mean, it's gotta be five and six feet tall. I mean, it's totally boring. And I literally said cards. It's fucking Wiley Coyote. And then I was like, Oh God, I gotta call animal control. I'm gonna have this fucking dead broken coyote on the other side. I go in the other side, it's just gone. Flew off. And Oh, they were explaining to me. I was like, well, look, if there's a coyote, I'm going to hear them, you know, killing my dog.

Speaker 2:          02:29:14       I'll be able to hear it, you know, I'll just leave the door open. He goes, oh, no, no. You don't understand. Coyote is work because they're so cunning. The way that they kill a larger animal is they befriend it first so it'll play with your dog for 45 minutes and then the other five will descend around it so it ingratiates it knows I need to ingratiate myself with you first and then kill you and they tire them out, so this happens a lot in runyon canyon. People's dogs. They'll just see him chasing the coyote and then the coyotes will just run and run and run until the dog is tired and then everyone will descend there and they're hungry and they're desperate and there do not give a fuck. A friend of mine up, Heaney was walking his dog like a small dog and a saw a coyote face to face and picked up his dog and the like had to like flex on it to get it to run away. Started walking again back to his house. He was like 20 feet from his house. He turned around. The coyote had come back with four other coyotes. They are just fearless and they live amongst us a little fucking monsters live. I mean, I have like compassion for them. If it's between my dog and a coyote, I'll, you know, kill a coyote with my hands. But it's, it's really sad when you're like, yeah, dude, I'm so sorry this was your fucking house. But it's not. It's never been really.

Speaker 5:          02:30:28       It's just constant domination. The rats didn't own it. They're killing rats. The Rats House, the code is a killing. The rafts are stealing. The rest of was trying to convince me that rats are really smart. Rats are pretty smart, but coyotes eat them. If we didn't have coyotes, we would have way more. Rats. We would have a huge rodent problem all throughout Los Angeles. Rods in my pool all the time. My daughter. There's a balance that has to be achieved and that's why wolves are really important. Like the people that think that we should re extra pate wolves and wiped them out. Definitely not. But if you look at some of the things that have happened, yes, gray wolves do gray wolf, gray wolves don't interbreed with coyotes, but red wolves do. So gray wolves killed coyotes. So where they've reintroduced wolves. That's another interesting thing about yellowstone that you reintroduced the wolves to yellowstone.

Speaker 5:          02:31:12       They dropped the coyote population down 50 percent because the gray wolves were killing the coyotes, but because when you kill coyotes and do the roll call thing, the females are larger letters. They rebounded and now are more coyotes in yellowstone than were before they reintroduced the wolves. They're so fucking adapted. Their amazing. Well, I mean I also just love that dogs were wolves wants and just they just. Some coyotes survive. Survival is can still breed with dogs just like wolves can. Yeah. It's just survival of the friendliest. They realized like, Oh, and then so wolves evolved to be dogs and then realized to protect us. They could survive and now they protect us against wolves. Yeah. How the fuck did that ever happen to. Like I said, Neil degrasse Tyson did his, his cosmos. He did that thing about it. That was kind of short but sorta.

Speaker 5:          02:31:59       But you still like God damn it. Yeah. How did it become a poodle? Whoa. Fuck. Did the Afro, like how was it was like a genetic mutation. Then we really latched onto, well I think it's also the cutest ones are the ones that survived. Right, because they're the ones. Yeah. Cute. Sweet. And the ugly ones are the ones that got weeded out. Yeah, but the balance that this George Monbiot, I think that's how you say his name, like his, his take on wolves, turning like the people love that video because he's English and he's got a beautiful voice. Fascinating story. And it's interesting. Yeah. Well there's a lot of truth to what he's saying. Like it's important to have keystone predators because they keep the populations of these game animals or you know, like wild undulates, the keep them healthy because they control them. But when wolves get to populated, they get crazy and they do what they call surplus killing.

Speaker 5:          02:32:54       Like they killed 19 elk recently in Wyoming and they didn't need any of them. They just went on this butchering ron and just kill. It was. They were. They come over the top of a hill and they see a herd of elk. Have you? Have you ever seen a herd of elk are amazing. Sometimes they're huge. Sometimes a herd of elk, maybe a hundred, 200 strong and it's amazing. You'll come over a hill. I've only seen maybe 30 of them together, but it's quite a sight. It's amazing. Like you're just fucking 30 of them together. And we were, we came over the top of this hill and we were like, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, look at. And then she's heard of my old, you know, 500 to a thousand pound forest cows that are wandering it. Look, there's a

Speaker 4:          02:33:35       good. I saw Moose in Jackson Hall and I was like, that's rare because those are all bowls. Female smells around amongst them. So wolves. I saw Moose, Moose, and the guy, the guy that was. We were doing a little thing on the skull. The Snake River, I don't know. Jackson hole was explaining how most cal bears. You kick them. It's so fucked up. I think he said there was a video somewhere of it. I, I, I'm too terrified to look at it. That they wait because they obviously can't fight the thing. They wait till the bears. Yeah. Running up on them and they just wait, wait, wait, don't get the last minute. Just basically knock their head off their bodies.

Speaker 5:          02:34:14       Fifteen percent of all wolves that die get killed by. That's

Speaker 1:          02:34:18       amazing. Yeah. Fifteen percent. That's the mortality rate of wolves. That's fucking crazy moves. Don't give a fuck. They don't give a fuck. I didn't realize how big. I mean they're just like tanks. Oh my God. They're fast. They're huge. Yeah. You're just like, what is the first time I saw one? We were hunting them in BC and we saw this female and it was like that seem drastic park. When Jeff Goldbloom sees the dynamo sore for the first time, we were like maybe like five or 600 yards away from them and we opened up the window, looked outside and there were huge

Speaker 3:          02:34:51       wandering through this field and you know, they're living in a dark, dark place where we found one that had been killed, a calf that had been killed by wolves and it would have been, had been killed hours earlier. It was fairly fresh. It was a crazy scene. I put it up on instagram and it's such a strange scene because there's this carcass,

Speaker 1:          02:35:09       but there's hair everywhere, like everywhere. They just show the hair. You can find it.

Speaker 3:          02:35:16       Jamie was like a probably a year old. It's old instagram picture, but the picture was, it was when we got there because we saw these, um, these crows, some circling. It was all crows and there were squawking and we walked up on it and we found this thing just devastated. But it's so eerie to think that there's these wild roaming. Pat Canadian wolves are just wild as fuck. They've never been extricated. They've always. These are the same rules that they brought into yellowstone were actually Canadian walls that gray North American, uh, United States gray walls were actually smaller than the ones they brought from Canada. Because mammals, when mammals come from colder climates, they have larger bodies. That's why move somewhere away. Again,

Speaker 1:          02:35:59       this is a bare fucking gangster, sir. As barbwire on the fence, this thing climbed at 12 foot high. They don't know how it did it. Come to 12 foot high fence. Got fucking Koala bear. Oh God. Just seeing that thing like, Huh, zoo, I thought it was fucking saved. That thing should be in the fucking zoo. Like why is that how you got out? No, fuck that out. And got in their lives. It's an la celebrity even before becoming a lead suspect and quality killing. Just a month of poison. No, it's pretty recently. Just it doesn't have a collar on because they're touching it, right? Yeah. Oh yeah. It's got a collar. Yeah. Yeah, they, they are tracking it. His name is [inaudible] to give him a name, like he's a fucking prisoner. How about Cuban name for Fred Before I. Oh God, don't. Koalas was missing. You're sad that the parents are not even from the same fucking continent. What is, what if, can you imagine this call has never seen a fucking mountain lion and it's life probably. Oh No, definitely not. And it's like, what the fuck? You probably saw that one game of thrones.

Speaker 4:          02:37:16       Yeah, exactly. That's true. But um, before the fake poisoning of it, maybe I'm conflating it with something else, but I was probably other ones who have been poisoned or something cause they were saying, stop putting poison out on your lawn because fucking kill monsters. Yeah. You're your into Kelly's awesome. A broken murderers. Um, is that uh, okay. So a friend of mine was hiking in Griffith Park and her dog came back covered in like innards of it, like deer enter. It's like, like, I mean like literally had like, like in trails up all, like wrapped around it. The nose and the mountain lion had killed deer and the dog roll around in it. Why does a dog roll around in a dead animal? They always do that. Those are fun. A dead squirrel in the road. Get the scent on it. I'm not really sure because it actually makes me think it would make another animal one to attack you if you smell like blood and in or it's. I think they know you're not dead. But I do know my dog. Another dead body is awesome. Same outline. It's got poisoned but it didn't die. Okay. So I'm not a total. Okay. Poster

Speaker 5:          02:38:20       cat for California's rat poison problem. Well, you know, there's two options. You poisoned the rats or you invite more coyotes to lived near your house. You know, they say when they eat dog cats. Tony too. It's also in the damn floor. His podcast. He talks about how when they eat dogs, they're not really eating dogs because they want to eat them for like a meal as much as they want to eliminate predators, like competing predators, especially with cats because most of what they eat like a coyote, Z, like a lot of bugs that eat a lot of grasshoppers. They eat a lot of rats. They ate a lot of rodents, rabbits. But they. The cat's compete with them because cats are a fucking murderers and now. But they this shit about how many cats do you see that off my instagram page, this article that I posted, but how many fucking birds and mammals?

Speaker 5:          02:39:07       Cats kill the US alone every year. Just cass house cats there. There's billions in the b. look at this. Responsible for the deaths of one point four to three point 7 billion birds and six point nine to 20 point 7 billion mammals every year in the mammal. Squirrels, squirrels, whatever. When I was a kid, I had this cat and he, um, he killed a squirrel and he was walking. He, we lived across the street from this park and this cat killed this squirrel and had it inbetween his. He had a bit. He bit his neck and had its body underneath his body. So he's walking with this weekend at Bernie's, dragging it, holding onto it and like having to walk around the. Oh yeah. We called this kitty like my cows named kitty. Like that was his name. Like we had a name for my name to him, like Conan the barbarian. The comic books had like a lion that he has had a Jaguar as a pet. I forget what his name was. I named it that my like, shut the fuck up.

Speaker 3:          02:40:14       So you know, no one in my house. So it became, his name was kitty, but Katie was like, I had a big black hat.

Speaker 4:          02:40:20       Cats are sociopaths. Murderer ever. See when, uh, when Tippi hedren came out, because remember she like raised lions and Melanie Griffith grew up with lions and shit in the house. Oh yeah. Google Tippi. Hedren lions. Yeah. What the fuck. And she recently came out and was like, that was a horrible idea. That was a mistake. It was super dangerous. Like one of them I think cut up Melania Griffin had to have surgery on it because one of them bought her like, yes. So she grew up with these things in her hats. Melanie Griffith? Nope. That's Tippi hedren her mom. What? What? So just go through it. Which has a fucking pet lion. No, she had tons of them here. Keep going, keep going. And you'll see more and more. So how do they do that and not get killed? These motherfuckers will, you have to raise them from infancy? Look at their. I mean they have tiger because they're part of the pack or like a pride. I guess it would be. But what if they just decided to play with any moment at any moment, at any moment? Look on the kids. They could. And they did. So they try to make a movie out of it and one of the cameramen got his face ripped off and they were like, nevermind. Anxiety. I know. Because you know that there sociopathic. I think if he's not social

Speaker 3:          02:41:28       pathic, they just natural. That's the look. They have all of these reward mechanisms that are built into their DNA. They feel good when they chase after things and kill them. They need to hunt. That's part of the problem with zoos, is it these things? It's like, it's like extracting a guys come through a straw. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like, oh, I know you need to get rid of your comms, but you're still horny. Does that make sense?

Speaker 4:          02:41:54       Part of that, yes. That's part of the like hunting and will you got to. I'm with you. I'm actually with you on that. This is crazy. It's crazy. It's fucking crazy. And she came out recently and was like, Nah, nevermind. I'm really don't endorse doing that. How did she get rid of the lions when she still has them? You know what? I was trying to organize going to her because she has like a sanctuary and she tries to raise money to save lions. I mean because you know now like an Africa, there's more animals in captivity than they are on the wild. Like it's such a problem.

Speaker 3:          02:42:21       Yes, but. But that captivity, we're talking about high fence operations that are sometimes a hundred thousand plus acres. Yeah. Many, many, many square miles. So you look at the actual range that aligned would inhabit and oftentimes it's much smaller than what we're calling like a pejorative way. It's like they're not safe. Well, they're fenced in. Let's see. One of the fucking crazy catch 22 is about Africa. Is that Lou? Do you know? Louis through documentary and I've listened to him on your show. Did you watch his documentary on African Hunter? It's fucking crazy. But many of the animals that people hunt in Africa, we're very close to extinction just a few decades ago when they put value on them and they set up these hunting camps. Now they're in there in higher populations than ever before, but they're in higher populations because people go over there to hunt them, so they have these places where you go and it's kind of fucked up.

Speaker 3:          02:43:20       Like there's a waterhole, you sit it in front of a waterhole, they have a blind, you hide in, the blind animal comes down, you shoot it, and it's all trapped in a. well, I mean it isn't. It isn't. It isn't. It isn't. It's certainly not like target practice. It's more that than anything else. So it's. Is it, is it better to go and get a steak from an animal that lived in captivity or is it better to shoot an animal as it goes to get water? Well, it's not as good as going to the woods. Like you go into the woods, you go shoot a wild elk. That elk does. It might not even know what a fucking person is, hopefully doesn't even see you coming and you shoot it and kill it. That's like the ultimate goal is to instantaneously and this wild existence that if you didn't kill it, it would be killed by bears or wolves or something else.

Speaker 3:          02:44:08       That's the idea, but or they freeze to death or they kill each other. There's a lot of killing each other. These, these, these antlers. They're not like for digging for fruit. That's why they have them and each other. I mean, that's why they have them. I mean, you see this deer, that's why he has it to kill other deer so he can get all the pussy. That's literally what it. Therefore, it's a knife that grows out of your head, so it's not fascinating. But what's crazy is these animals were worth nothing and they were being slaughtered by poachers. And then you go, well, these poachers, man, that's fucked up. Yes, but they're really fucking poor. So what do you do about that? Because you have these people that are living over there that there have to risk their lives to try to poach these animals for meat, for food.

Speaker 3:          02:44:53       And then there's the fucking, the horrible trade like rhinos and candles. I mean, it's like it's like saying to a drug addict stopped doing heroin. It's like, well you have to replace it with something in the narcotics anonymous or another drug or something. So you can't say stop poaching without like, okay, there's no other way to fucking make money. Exactly. There. The poverty is insane. I have had friends that have gone over to Africa and one of the things that they say is you just like my friend Justin Wren, who he goes to the Congo stays there for months at a time and he's building wells over there. He's amazing guy. He's the guy who just got malaria for the second time. It's like you don't even understand what poverty is until you see how these people live. These poor people. So I don't blame them for poaching.

Speaker 3:          02:45:35       I mean, and if it becomes, if it goes, if it's between selling a rhino horn and feeding your child, it's like fuck man. Not Online. Like looking at the statistics about animals. They're literally, it's just it. Taylor be killed. They're barely making it. They're barely making it. I mean, I am 100 percent against killing rhinos for their horns. Make no mistake about it. I think it's horrible and it's disgusting. But these people that were calling poachers, you know, you, you, you add that pejorative, you know, you, you give them that label and you take away. They could do it like, like a poor people.

Speaker 5:          02:46:10       They're desperate poor people and they're not making that much money. The people actually kill a rhino. They're not making much money. They were making a few hundred dollars or whatever the fuck they can get. They're selling it to someone else and that other person is making a fuck load of money and it's all gross. It's gross and it's all scary. But the Louis Theroux documentary does the best job of highlighting how fucked it is over there. And it's one of the things that the guy who runs the camp says to them, because Louise like constantly pastoring, I'm badgering him as what does, why does it plays? Well, how are you doing? He's like giving them all these questions and finally the guy snaps and he's like, after I got, he's fucked. You don't understand Africa, he fucked. He goes, if these fucking animals are not worth something, they'd be gone.

Speaker 5:          02:46:53       Do you understand this? This really crazy moment where you realize the problem is not as simple as why do people want to go over there and hunt? The problem is this breakdown of what we call civilization in this area where you have people that are impossibly poor and they're surrounded by animals and the only value of around them as animals. It's so crazy. It's so crazy, so fucking crazy. So it's either you're involved in the tourism business that has people coming to look at these animals or you just have to fucking kill. And by the way, the tourism industry is not as fucking profitable as the. It's just not because it. If you want to go over there and kill a lion, it costs you $50,000. And what's really fucked up is these lions now in Zimbabwe where that cecil the lion was killed. They're killing 200 of them.

Speaker 5:          02:47:45       They're just going to poach them, not poach them, just going assassinate them because they have too many and now the lions are destroying all the unduly population. They had a balance that they had created through hunting lions down there like coyotes or will like here with the fucking lions. Look, they're amazing. Lions are incredible. Look, I saw that thing you posted of the lion king. My fucking phone. Look again. I'm jumping off that thing, but look at this. This is my phone that I'm fucking lying on my phone. I mean we have to go to Tippi. Hedren some fascinating by. I don't think anybody should shoot lines. I don't want to shoot a lion. I don't think. I don't think it's cool, but they're in the car with teeth. They're terrifying. There was a beautiful article that was written by this woman who lived in Zimbabwe right after the Cecil, the lion thing, and it said in Zimbabwe we don't cry for lions, and it was explaining how they terrorized her village, how they killed her loved ones and how people were. When they would go out into the bush, it would be a very real concern that they would be killed by a lion and it's not that the line is bad, it's just that that's what lines they fucking do and I can't have too many of them. You can't. You can't have too many of them and the only way to control their population is human beings and so that thing back to like we are not the top of the food chain. We're

Speaker 1:          02:49:08       just not. We're not very simple, but we are, but we are with A. With a weapon. We are a caveat. Yeah. With a huge caveat with it. You have to be able to first of all know how to shoot a fight like me and that machete or Fucking Samurai sword. I'm not the top of the food. I don't know how to fucking use most of the weapons out there. A drunk person who wasn't, couldn't walk that good. You fuck them up with that. You know what I mean? That's all. Depending on what's the level of the threat. Since I have no ability to even understand how anxious it would make me to be in a room with the lion, a lion is probably faster than me picking up a gun and shooting it. I'm dead by the time I pick it up where you would have to first of all not just know how to shoot a gun. You would have to have experienced shooting a gun under pressure to manage your anxiety and to shoot it. I went to a shooting range and I was like cool. Like I could not even. It was like. It was ridiculous.

Speaker 1:          02:50:08       I was so bad. I was like, shooting guns is really hard. You have to be strong and you have to focus. You have to. It's a skill. You have to learn how to do it, so it's like most of us don't have that. I mean a lot of people, even that skill you're shooting at a piece of paper that's not going to move. It's not going to attack you. This is a thing that wants to kill me. Exactly. Knows how to get around my gun, but I'm going to go to an intermediate place, go from the piece of paper that's not going to attack you and try to shoot a wild pig that you just. You're gonna eat like it's nerve wracking. It's like what they called trigger panic where people get on the PA or target panic there. They're about to shoot and they can't keep their guns steady. They can't keep their. It's even more difficult with bow and arrow. You can it steady. It's like it's insane. You don't know. You're like, you just want to get it over with. You just want to shoot it. What was that noise?

Speaker 1:          02:51:04       The few of us together when it started, but there's this panic where you just want to get it over with. You're so overwhelmed you can't breathe and you just want to pull the trigger in and most people miss like the vast majority of people that sure bowhunt miss or rifle hunt, miss. It's a matter of controlling anxiety and I'm sure that exists in the navy seals one of their training as you know, they put a bag over their head and take it off and disorient them so that they can quickly focus their eyes because when something's moving around, it's just like it's a muscle to be asked to, you know, well, just dealing with adversity, dealing with anxiety, dealing with the moment is here now you've been training, you've been preparing, ready crisis on. You see that with fighting all the time. There's guys that look amazing and the gym and they get to a fight and they can't perform. You can't really simulate that experience. Right. There's no way in practice to really simulate it. Even in practice when you have like you go a lot like you have simulated fights, there

Speaker 5:          02:52:06       would have like an audience and shoot his room, his practices and talk a lot of shit. Talking Shit puts a lot of pressure on you too. That's a big thing. Like guys do that. Bowhunters do that. They talk shit to each other while they practice. It's a big thing. They'll have competitions and during the competition they're talking shit to each other and the idea of it is you're just trying to disorient the guy and it helps them like guys welcome it because it actually helps them concentrate on blocking everything out because the moment when you're actually having to shoot an animal, so your hardest fucking take it in the air and you freak out. So it's nothing like that for someone to talk shit, but at least it's better than you being. Some players do that. I'll do that. Yeah. They like fuck with each other and you know, try to throw each other off.

Speaker 5:          02:52:52       I guess it was probably not the same thing, but it's more of like, you know, distract the lawyers get in their heads. Is that called sharking? That's what the. A real a shark is not like, you know, people think, oh, he's a pool shark. It's not what it means in the world of pool players. Someone is really good at pool. You would say someone who hides it. There are a hustler, someone who doesn't hide it, they're a player, but what a shark is, is actually a dishonorable thing. A shark is someone who fucks with your head, tries to get you to miss. Like they might do things on purpose, like drop their queue as you're shooting or they might, um, they might make a noise to distract you. That's what's called sharking like, just to try to psych illegal. I don't even know. I mean you can't get where you agree or not agree, but some people just do it. But in tournaments sometimes I feel like right before you go on and they're like weird crowd when we were talking about Doug Davidoff, Mark Marin

Speaker 1:          02:53:48       or that, or I'm the worst is when they're like, great crowd. So if you go on and do well, it's not because you were good at just the crowd was good. Well sometimes it's a good warning though.

Speaker 5:          02:53:58       Came off stage at the Improv the other night, I and he was getting off stage and I was walking in the room and he came up and gave me a hug and he goes, dude, worst fucking crowd. Ever I'm like, really? And I was like, maybe for you bitch, and I went up there and they were fucking terrible.

Speaker 1:          02:54:12       Doing crowds are weird. It's such a testament to our group. Think for a whole crowd to unify as Shitty as just really warm in the room, first of all, which is always bad. Never read something about hot. That makes me like what the week was Wednesday night, Wednesday nights. Weird too, because you've got to go to work because you've been there for. It's at comegys show. It's fucking midnight. No, no I won't. I will not go on past 10:00, but it's good for you. I can't. I cannot do it now. I know. It's just. I know what this is. Everyone's tired. They want to go home. They're looking at their check. I'm. They're good. I think those experiences are good in the beginning for eight years. Yeah, I agree with you. Yeah, like I paid the fee. I mean I used to do standup at lucky strike on

Speaker 4:          02:55:04       highland and I'd have to time my jokes knowing a bowling ball was about to hit some pins I'd be like at. Anyway, so then he called me and then I never called him back like you had to time your jokes. I did a road gig once at a restaurant in Massachusetts where the inner calm that the restaurant use to call people's tables was the same system as the microphone that I used on, so it'd be in the middle of talking about something. Johnson party of your table's ready. Fucking great. It was the only time they ever did comedy there. It was. I was the only one. It was like a one person show too. I just went up there. I was like this be. Did you ever. Do you remember Miyagi's on sunset? Literally do. It's a Sushi restaurant. It's not there anymore. You would do.

Speaker 4:          02:55:47       There was like a stage Taco now. Exactly, and there was a stage and then there was a bridge with like a creek. Yes. Fucking fountain between you and the bridge and like a coy gardens, like a little Chinese garden and then a bunch of people and then they always had mtv jams on television. There were televisions on every wall and people are just watching TV and then you're just yelling. I remember one time Duncan trussell got on there and we couldn't even, we didn't even know people could hear us and I was like, I don't think anyone could even. I like I did we, are we bombing or can they hear us? And then done controls. I got on stage and started basically yelling the most offensive things imaginable and nobody responded and we realized like, oh, they just can't hear us yelling. He was just like yelling and everyone just kept eating crazy as me.

Speaker 4:          02:56:38       August is across the street from what used to be Dublin's wasn't. I didn't ever do that. I remember that was like the Hashtag Dane Cook. Yeah, I got it. I missed my thing already. I mean I'm just, I have to get my hair back to Brown. Why? Because it's for your sexy and so real. Yeah, exactly. I want to distract anyone. I don't want to become a sex symbol. Uh, I don't need that stress and that pressure. Now I have to go back to Burnett. This was sort of a just because I'm working on something and they just don't want it to look blonde, I guess.

Speaker 4:          02:57:14       Fuck, I'm bleeding. I'm not a blonde. That's not my brand. I did it. Um, this is gonna sound weirdly narcissistic. I for some reason what they're a little spurt where I was getting recognized a lot. I was and I was touring and I was like, let me just dye my hair and see what happens. And nobody had any idea who I was. Soon as you went blonde, as soon as I went blonde I was just completely invisible. So you have a love hate relationship with being recognized? I don't not like it. It was literally more like, let's see what like, uh, let's see. It was like a, it was like a, it doesn't, it doesn't annoy me. It doesn't bother me. I'm super grateful. I see people that come up to me and airports as like my boss, like they're the ones that don't say that. The fucking guy who sent you the email. That's right. That dynamic. But it's outside window probably. He's going to hear about this. No, I think he's shooting. He's an Amy Schumer van.

Speaker 4:          02:58:09       He's done. He thinks I sold out years ago when I did a sec. Um. Oh you did. So I just, I was like, I was just stressing out it was causing anxiety because I never feel like I'm able to give people what they need and I just, you know, and I was like, I don't know, I'm going to airports and I'm just like, um, and I was dating somebody and I was getting recognized when we were on dates and it would just like make things weird and awesome. Don't. I just tried us like, and I don't, I'm not working on it. Let me just change it up.

Speaker 4:          02:58:35       That's it. And nobody fucking recognizes me. And then I'm like, hey, excuse me. I don't know if you know me, like totally having this like, hi guys. I don't know if you, do you have hbo go? I just, I'm so that. It was interesting what happened when nobody recognized me and then I felt invisible and I was like, oh, this isn't Chicago dealer. You know? It makes you realize when you get accustomed to stuff, and so god, how much attention do I fucking need? It's so embarrassing, and on that note, on that note, I'm going to go cry in my lithium battery battery car. This was a lot of fun. You're the best. It was really good. You are. I always had the best time with you. It was great time. Three hours was so flattered when you want me to have my friend who is always a good time. Alright fuckers. We'll be back tomorrow with a UFC bantamweight champion. Misha tate.
