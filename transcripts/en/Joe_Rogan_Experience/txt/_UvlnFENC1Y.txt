Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience. So, so what is it with scientology? Um, that's a good question. Um, I don't know, like if they have ceremonies, if they, I think when you look at that Tom cruise recruitment video, which is fucking fantastic, you know, when he's standing out there, if you've seen the one where they give them a metal guests, which is she fucking just so rich. It's a giant metal, many times larger than an Olympic gold medal. Uh, uh, he's wearing this metal and he's standing there in front of a fucking. It's called the freedom middle of valor and he's standing in front of all those people and he's such a charismatic person. There it is right there. Oh, Jesus Louisa's. We'll look at that fucking thing. Come on. Just the, the lack of like understanding how you come across that would allow you to wear that, the lack of objectivity that it will allow you to put that on and, and, and be able to do this fingertips down thing on the, uh, on the desk.

Speaker 1:          01:10          Like you're making a very important point while you're wearing a fucking Frisbee, a gold frisbee around your neck. It's almost like he's trying to convince himself by tricking all these people. I think there's something to that. There's something to, if you can get a thousand people to cheer at these words that you're saying and you know, no matter how fucking crazy they are, if you can get all these people to believe you and listened to you, it sort of validates. That may be you're not fucked up because you're in with all these other people that agree and fetuses and fucking, you know, all the other wacky shit that they believe. There's something to that where he's putting on his massive performance. Not just for them but for himself as well.

Speaker 2:          02:01          I have my own bill o'reilly story. Please send it to me. Well, the 48 laws of power just come out in [inaudible] 98 and Bill O'reilly decides to have me on the Riley if o'reilly factor, which was big then, but not as big as it became later on. And so I'm like, this is like one of my first shows I've ever been on. No, no, no, nothing like this ever happened to me before. And basically you go to a studio in Los Angeles where he's in New York and you're in this room and there's nothing around you. And they put an earphone in your head and you're staring at a camera. You don't see anything. You just hear bill o'reilly's stupid fucking voice in your ear asking you questions. It's like you're on drugs and it's so disconcerting. It's like the guy who's trying to put you off your game before you're already put off your game, the moment you start.

Speaker 2:          02:49          Anyway, he interviews me and I prepared like shit for this interview because I knew the questions coming. It was all about Monica Lewinsky and Clinton and the scandal and the 48 laws. And I nailed it. And he said, oh, that was a great interview, Robert. I'm going to have you on again. Okay. Wow. And so I'm feeling pretty good about myself. So four weeks later I trudge back to that office and I sit in that same chair with a little earphone in my head and he proceeds to just rip me to shreds about what? Well, essentially he hated the 48 laws of power. He liked the writing or whatever, but he was just using, posing his game. He was just, you know, completely. He was just using it as a way to attack Clinton, which I wasn't wanting to do that. So anyway, sorry. He was just like totally messing with me and I was so expecting the opposite that I was like, Ooh.

Speaker 2:          03:42          And then he goes, and then he says, well, what about this law about use selective honesty? And I said, well, it's something that politicians and business people use all the time. Like Lyndon Johnson for instance. And then I was about to explain how Lyndon Johnson's and he cuts me off. Yes, yes. The same man who said 58,000 men of our young men to death in Vietnam, let's break for a commercial. And that was the end of the interview. So he like made me look like I was supporting Lyndon Johnson, mit massacring, 58,000 Americans in Vietnam. He manipulated me and humiliated me and like, and the whole thing was he hates the 48 laws of power because it's all about manipulation and ugliness and he's the most fucking manipulative interviewer you could ever imagine. Look how he manipulated me. He completely set me up by making me think this was going to be like a, a softball interview where we were just, you know,

Speaker 3:          04:40          I think. Did I tell you this? I've told it, I'll stop. We've found out it was on a little plane. You're on a giant plane and it was on like a 7:37 year old that you in Australia, Virgin, a Virgin Australia, which has a groovy airline. So on the flight with me and my wife has the game, you know, this guy is rapper rod, he's got a tattoo and whatnot. And Carrie Hilden who's also a rapper and, and their policy, right? So it's hectic, right? It starts to get them p and the pilot comes on and goes like everybody's strap in. Okay. For like ever, and Australia's 15 hours, 16 minutes long this whole day. And this lasted literally five hours, right? Jess? Bouncing up and down, side to side, pitching yard, the whole thing. And on the, on the sky map it says like, Paygo, Paygo, 1500 kilometers, meaning your 1500 kilometers from paygo, paygo.

Speaker 3:          05:41          In other words, the Pacific Ocean is so big, there's no land masses, nothing anywhere near you. Where are your going over? Right? So you're not going to go in because it's turbulence, it's not your fucking freak me out. This is electric turbulence make planes crash and doesn't, unless there's some sort of shitty as structural defect on the plane, like the, you know, the wings aren't glued on or whatever. But I mean, not a structural defect. Generally. Generally you've been in a pilot turbulence data, you know, that's not what makes them crashing, you know? But anyways, he said it's terrible in any case. So we get through it and the next morning, uh, the rappers get up and they're all like, oh my God, I thought I was going to die. And you know, it was so bad last night I was praying and La, la La, they're all like really shook up and carry.

Speaker 3:          06:30          Hilton is a very lovely young rapper. Lady wakes up. It's been all night. Mind you, no one can move. I stopped holding my wife's hand for five. You know, like, like this for you goes like this. Oh, what happened? And the wrappers because you didn't feel that we are going to die that night. She goes, I take a pill. I didn't see any ambien's a motherfucker. And then she ate one piece of fruit and put on a leopard miniskirt and came out with their makeup and signed autographs. And I was like, you're a star. I want you on my team. You are Alexander the Great.
