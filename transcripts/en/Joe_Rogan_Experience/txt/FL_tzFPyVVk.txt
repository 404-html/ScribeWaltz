Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Struggle,

Speaker 2:          00:00:07       all right, ladies and gentlemen would live the presidents now blind spend staring at the sun all day trying to see the eclipse. There's photos of it. Mike Baker help us out. What? What are we doing, man? Well, Dahlia, that's probably, again, it's, it's, it's an indication that they don't have a lot of discipline in that Communications Department of the White House. No one got him the message, don't Sir Sir. Don't. Don't look at the sun. Not only that, definitely don't look at the sun while people are looking at you, Jesus Christ, the whole world is going to mock you. Don't you know that everybody knows is since they were a kid, right? Even even if you've never been involved in an eclipse, every kid knows. Don't look at the sun. It's the one thing that every child learned somehow. You know, when I tried to do that, I'm a fucking idiot. I took a two dark sunglasses.

Speaker 2:          00:00:49       I put them on top of each other. That'll where I put one pair and then I put another layer over. It doesn't work folks. It looks good. It does look good, but I only looked for a second and I went, oh, okay, this doesn't work, but you know where I could look at it. I can look at it through my pool, like the reflection. Oh sure. You'll see the eclipse, but it never really got fully dark here. No, we're too low. Yeah, we, I just came down from, from Idaho. I was up there in the mountains over the past few days and it was just, it did just hippies coming in from left and right. Tire state just overrun with the hippies and they're, I mean their parking and people's, you know, ranches, they just driving up on fields that have just been planted there just like they don't even think.

Speaker 2:          00:01:29       And so they. But they kept my. Yeah, you know, hey God bless him. I don't know that I was intellectually curious enough to really worry about the eclipse. There's a balance in. You know what? I think a lot of intellectual curiosity is great and a lot of hippie values are great, but then you go too far into the hippie retard gene pool and you get these dopey hippies that are hippies that know they're the worst kind of hippies, hippies that don't really want to do any work, but they want universal basic income. They want all of these. These one percenters, they have plenty of money so that no one should have to work ever. They just passed it. They passed a tax up in Seattle. It's gonna probably going to get struck down, but it basically, it was up in Seattle, will got blessed them up there.

Speaker 2:          00:02:13       They they've decided that they're going to go against the state charter, which says you can't have a attacks, right? An income tax, and they've gone ahead and done it for the. I think it's for the top two percent. The only tax that tax. The tax people are doing something right because you know, you gotta make this thing more equitable. That's hilarious. That's really funny. Well, what's interesting is that's the whole reason why a lot of companies like Amazon and Microsoft is the reason why they've located to Seattle. You fucking stomachs and they're going to pull out and then you wouldn't have any jobs and then you'll be poor. Somebody is going to pay for that. Yeah. We came from, we moved out from fairfield county, from New Canaan, Connecticut when we moved out to Idaho, which was the world's greatest movie of all. Connecticut. Sucks.

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       I say it over and over again and. But yeah, I mean, but they know it. You better get Noah and then people, but you live in a lucky spot and. And they, they, their plan, the, the, the plan of the governor and the rest of the crew there is when you need more money tax, fairfield county where I, which is home to new Canaan and Greenwich and Darien and Stanford. The people that work in the city or the people that are working in finance and now what they've, what they've had over the past three, four years. Ever since the governor's been running the shop is people moving out. I mean, every GE moved out of General Electric, the entire operation with General Electric said went to the state and said, I know people will think of why are we talking about this? But they went to the State House and they said, you can't keep doing this.

Speaker 3:          00:03:47       You can't keep jacking it up on us to pay for everything. We're happy to pay and we are apparent, our fair share. But so they did that in general. Like you said, we're going to move. The state didn't believe him. They've all relocated to Boston. Um, they've got, uh, who else is moving to Aetna? I think the, uh, the large insurance company, you know, now Connecticut's known as sort of the insurance capital, right? They're leaving hedge funds, private equity groups moving down to Florida. And again, great pay your fair share, but at a certain point everybody's got to contribute something. You can't just say that's what you're gonna do. And I'm not in the one percent. I wish I was. It used to be when you were a kid, you wanted to be rich right now, you know, I don't know what people want. They want to be in the middle. You want to be comfortable. That's where you want to be comfortable. I, I don't know, I always thought it'd be pretty cool to be wealthy and all and, and I think I'd be pretty good at it.

Speaker 4:          00:04:35       My friend Brian Cowen said it best once and it stuck with me forever. He said, you know what you want to be. You want to be to the point where you don't have to worry about your bills and you can go to a restaurant and not worry about what you order. He goes, everything other than that, it's bullshit.

Speaker 3:          00:04:48       Yeah. Because everybody, you know, and that's, that's a good point I guess because that's, you take that stress out of your life and then I get, well I guess you're gonna worry about it.

Speaker 4:          00:04:56       So people find it. Yes. Just stress and stress, right? I mean like look at these assholes that buy these $500,000,000 yachts. It's like they just realized like, oh, enough problems in my life. I need to buy a fucking floating city. And then I got, I got to hire a crew of 100 to hate me, talk shit about me. Every time I turned my back they, I want to fuck my wife, dammit. I'm going to get in line. Bosens made finished. Compost is made. I know what I came up with. Bows. And is that a real thing? I think it is. Yeah. I think there was such thing as a [inaudible] made this always like this ebb and flow, right? I mean the people that have accumulated too much wealth, especially when it comes to like hedge fund people and finance people. It's like, what are you actually doing? Right? And you're using that money to influence policy and that policy allows you to extract more money from the system and it gets real slippery because occasionally you guys fuck up and it crashes the whole economy. Right? Like that kind of money is like really creepy. But when you're talking about someone who's developed a legitimate product, they sell it and they're successful, they work hard. They made something. Some does business. Exactly.

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       Yeah. Yeah. The hiring people there, you know there's a, there's a house for sale up in the Hamptons, now there's a house for $175. Million Dollars. It seems logical. Yeah. One hundred and $75,000,000. But you know what? It's on the beach. So it's, it's got waterfront to it. So I guess that explains the Price Tag. But here's the thing about that water fund. Anybody can walk in front of your house. Yeah, that's true. That's a huge problem in Malibu. There's this, a couple of other I'm friends with and their sons surf and they live in Malibu. They have a house in Malibu and they were surfing in the water in front of this house. This guy comes out and yells and screams at him, you know, get the fuck off the beach because you know, a $10,000,000 house right there on the beach. And they're like, what are you talking about?

Speaker 2:          00:06:37       Like we live right over there. You piece of shit. And like not only that, anybody can be on this beach. This is the ocean. You can't, you don't own the private beach signs up and ate it and for the most part that's true. Up and the Hamilton, I think this actually has some private beach frontage, which again, so $175 million seems somewhat reasonable. Hampton's most expensive home. There it is right there. One hundred and $75. Got a lake, a. he's got a lake and then further past the leg. Wow. They all have lakes. What is that? Is that freshwater or brackish water? That must be brackish water, right? I guess. I guess a pretty bad ass don't have fish in your front yard like that. I wonder if the kitchen appliances convey how big is this house? Is that. Wait a minute. That overhead view was the entire property baller.

Speaker 2:          00:07:24       You know what though? But look at that picture though. Does that look like $175? Million dollars in your mind when you think the whole fucking thing. She'd be plated in gold. Forty two acres. Wow. Okay. There you go. That's what, that's what it is. Oh, the Ford family. Oh Ah. Oh. Well the car company. So hashtag balling on Mustang if you get, I think you're right, if you get to that point where you can entertain the idea of maybe I'll put 10 percent down and then I'll take the rest of the mortgage. Um, then yeah, you've probably got too much money. He reminds me of that scene in the big Lebowski when you meet the big Lebowski and he's in the wheelchair and his wife's off from the suck dude's Dick for a thousand bucks. You know, it's like, that's the kind of shit that happens. You get a trophy wife, you buy yourself a mansion and your days are just filled with stress is such a great movie. It's a great movie. God, I used to use that movie to judge whether or not I enjoyed people's opinions. Really. Tell me anything about the big Lebowski.

Speaker 2:          00:08:20       Okay. I talked to a lot of people. They said I couldn't make it through the first hour and I'm thinking, how do you not? How do you not find this funny? Gees, I let my kids watch it. The admittedly the two youngest walked away, but the older one, he, you know. So anyway, uh, yeah, I've taken him fishing tomorrow morning off to Alaska in the morning. Oh, salmon or halibut? Salmon. The Salmon. I aren't uh, you know, interested in us. We'll go after some. Halibut is a silver salmon season right now. Right. Okay. So you're on the open water. So when you guys go, well, we'll go. Yeah, we'll go up to catch can a, which is really interesting place by itself. And then we've got to take a plane out of there about, uh, about 45 minutes outside of that to a little place called [inaudible] Bay and they have a really good operation up there and he spent a lot of time and to be honest with you, if the, if the fish aren't biting, then we just go hiking.

Speaker 2:          00:09:12       I'm going to take my boy will be a first time for him to go up there and it's going to be great. It's got. But I've just now emptied the freezer of a salmon and halibut and rock fish from the last trip. So it's time to stock up again, but it's just a great time of year. Isn't that a great thing? To have fish that you caught in your freezer, they can go back to the, you know, it was only like an hour old by the time you threw it on the ice. It's, it's fantastic. And so if and, and just also just getting up there, if people have been up to Alaska to get up there and see it before it melts. I said that I think it's good. It'll be fine. Are you worried about it? Um, you know what? Not in the sense that Oh my God, if I, if I don't quit driving my wagon here, the glaciers are going to all melt away.

Speaker 2:          00:09:54       I, I, you know, I'm sure we have some impact and it's like everything else, right? The truth is in the middle somewhere, right? So I'm sure we should all do our part, but do I think we're all gonna you know, the polar bears are dying off tomorrow. I know, but well there's definitely somebody with their ideas. Yeah. There's definitely some issues with polar bears in areas that have less ice, but apparently the polar bear population. This is something that I've read about Canada, at least in Canada, the polar bear population is higher than it's been in years. Now there's a, there's not a shortage of polar bears, but if you go over there to like they have hunts for polar bears, like they pay people to take them on polar bear hunts, but then you can't bring the polar bear back to the United States so you can keep it in Canada.

Speaker 2:          00:10:39       You can like if you come from Europe and you want to hunt a polar bear, you can. It's all very. Well. You mentioned trying to pack a polar bear back into the states to know. I just shot that. You can see what the reaction would be a. I think it's yeah, everybody should do their part, right? There's no doubt about that. You know, don't be a Douche and. But the problem is in part it's like both sides, they latch onto one piece of information. Right? So like what you just said, you know, the polar bear population to grow so that once I will latch onto and say, see, there's no such thing as climate change and the other side we'll find one piece of it and they'll latch onto that and then, okay. And like I said, I, I'm a big believer that somewhere in the middle is where most of the truth sets, but I'm sure there's definitely polar bear problems higher north, right in the ice caps.

Speaker 2:          00:11:24       And I mean I've seen some, some issues where they're talking about polar bear starving up there and the lack of ice contributing to starvation deaths. And yeah, so I, but it's, it's, uh, regardless, I'm looking forward to the last guy. I think regardless of what the hell happened to the polar bears, I'm going to have a good trip. Um, but I think it's, it's a beautiful state. People should get up there if they haven't been up there. It's amazing. Yeah. It's one of the rare places that you could go to in America that is like real wilderness and that is a really wild place. And, and you can get. Yeah, exactly. And it doesn't take, it doesn't take much to get up there and money I just made, it doesn't, it's not the effort that people, I think sometimes imagine it to be right. And uh, yeah, so it's, it's a, it's a great trip.

Speaker 2:          00:12:07       Kids really looking forward to it and it's weird that it's the United States, isn't it? When you look at the map. Yeah. You think about how it was put together. That's a fascinating story. I, for what? That's worth people. That's another good interesting read is how we cobbled this country together and sort of some of it was just incredible genius on the part of some folks. Some of it was serendipity, some of it was, you know, short sighted vision on the part of the Russians or the French or oh they fucked up. But with Alaska the Russians fucked up. Yeah. What did they give that to us for like 50 bucks? It wasn't much money. It wasn't much. No, I guess we got our money's worth out of that by now. But uh, anyway, so yeah, we'll do that. And, and, uh, and, and I planned this trip.

Speaker 2:          00:12:49       Of course their school starts tomorrow. They're there, all three of them are in elementary school, so their school starts tomorrow and uh, and I gave my kid that option. I said, do you want to, you know, he starts in fifth grade. I said, do you, do you want to stay here so you don't miss the first few days at school? And he looked at me like, what are you crazy exactly an idiot. I mean, that's how. But it's what his eyes said. He didn't say that. How old is he? He's just turned 10. He's got to learn more in the woods. Absolutely. Absolutely. For a couple of days. Yeah. Have a good time. Have a wonderful experience. Because of course the grizzlies are out looking for the salmon. I mean, and it's a, it's just fantastic. That's the safest time to be around them. So when their salmon out, yeah, they're just fat and happy there and they don't bother you.

Speaker 2:          00:13:31       And so, uh, you know, if something happens to my 10 year old and my wife said it's going to be my fault, that's on my head and I can't blame her. That would, that would be true. But do you pack when you're out there, you packing the side arm? Um, no, no we don't because we're, when we go up there and we're going up with uh, what, uh, uh, about a dozen other guys and they pan, they deal with the lodge does stay in the small little sort of. It's not, I, you know, I say launch. It's a wonderful place. Family owned. It's not a fancy place at all, but it's a great little spot and they do a great job. The guides are fantastic. So, um, we'll have a good time. But yeah, we don't, we don't take anything with us. I mean it's just. Yeah, no, that makes sense.

Speaker 2:          00:14:12       As long as the people up there, I mean, you probably won't need anything as long as the bears have fish. They really have. No. There's an area that we've shown this video before of this enormous grizzly that gets right next to this guy who's sitting there photographing these bears, eating a fish out of the river, and the bear literally couldn't give a fuck. He just looks at him and just sort of wanders off and there's actually a statistic that no one has ever died in this area. No, no person has ever been attacked or killed in this one area just because it's just overrun with.so preoccupied this time of year. But it's also, you know, you talk about how things change around the planet and the salmon runs are

Speaker 4:          00:14:52       really being impacted right now by a variety of reasons. You know, it's not just one thing, but. So anyway. Uh, but that'll be, that'll be good. And I know that everybody was really keen to hear about my upcoming trip. So, you know, I mean, it is interesting to hear people's take on the climate issue because there's hard left and hard, right? Hard, right is a, it's a cycle. It's always happened this way and you're, you're impeding business. Hard left is we're all going to die and then Miami's going to drown. I mean, uh, an Al Gore had dirty predicted in that movie an inconvenient truth that we were going to be covered in water in 2014, 2014. They were predicting that the ocean levels are going to rise the point where we're going to have to start evacuating some of the coastal cities. And he missed that one just by a little bit, but yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:15:35       Yeah. But baby came out with another movie. 12 people saw an inconvenient truth and um, nobody, nobody. I just watched it, I don't think. But it's, you see bill Nye when he was on Tucker Carlson's show. No, it was very interesting. It was very interesting. Cause I'm bill Nye who is not really a scientist. What is he? Is He, uh, he's just an engineer's near the base to have to be smart, but you know, he calls himself Bill Nye the science guy. He's bothered by the way, as an undergraduate degree, sunny even a phd I want to be. And they were uh, they were talking about climate change. And Tucker Carlson said, I'm willing to absolutely believe that people have an impact on climate change. He goes, but can you tell me how much? And then Bill Nye kind of got flustered and you know, he, he got like little confrontational defensive.

Speaker 4:          00:16:32       It's really kind of interesting because Tucker kept pestering him like, we're talking about science. So I would like you to tell me how much of an impact have people had. What are the numbers? Is it a narrow range? Because you give me a narrow range. It's just what he does is he publicizes science for his own personal benefit. Is that terrible show on Netflix. Bill Nye saves the world, bitch, you're not saving shit then. Okay. You can't call your shell. Bill Nye saves the world. You're not saving the world with this crazy goddamn song about gender. And he has, oh my God. Did you see that? That was, that was stunning. Who The fuck greenlit dad? Like I love Netflix, but hey, a little quality controls. Not a bad thing. Just have somebody on set to go hope. What we'll say is this like this, like a sensor, like in the old, but that movie, good morning, Vietnam, you know somebody that sits there and reads through his material before he does it and I saw that.

Speaker 4:          00:17:26       Not that you know it clearly they don't have anybody who has to approve as content. That shows you where his mindset that he's willing to say yes to that. That's someone who wants to acquiesce with no uncertain terms to the left. Yeah. Like he just wants to. Every meanwhile he had a film out of a movie or a television show out years ago where he was describing gender and it was basically saying there's genders and it's about x and y chromosome, which is what everybody's been told in science and biology class. Then he has this show just a few years later where thou, the tide has turned politically where this is such a weird subject about gender and sexual identity and gender identity and so he's got these songs about, you know, like what that lady singing that song like, Hey, this is fucking terrible. Like what all you're doing. It's just like the same thing as president trump staring at the sun. Yeah. All you're doing is setting yourself up for rootless criticism. That's going to diminish any potential legitimate point that you actually have.

Speaker 3:          00:18:25       But I will say this, I don't think he really got pilloried for it. Right? I mean nobody really. Um, I mean there was some, some mine. Yeah. I think some people make fun of them, but I think Bill Knight for the most part, he knows it. It's a very comfortable place for him to do. Or for a lot of people, if they say, look, I just want to get the adulation of the left, the far left and then fine. I mean that's what you want to do, do it. But you see people that kind of shift their position and are happy to be there because they know they're going to be coddled. And I. So I, I get why he does it because it's a base of, of uh, it's an audience that he knows is gonna stick with them as long as he says the right things. And apparently he doesn't really give a shit about science. So he's happy to say anything. Well, I think he does give a shit about science.

Speaker 4:          00:19:11       He gives a shit more about people liking him and fitting in with this crowd of people. There's a weird thing that's going on in science and there's nothing like science is fantastic. It's critical for our civilization. I'm not a science criticizer, but there's a weird thing about people that are a part of science where their own egos and their own need for positive affirmation sort of supersede any critical thinking. So there's certain subjects that cannot be discussed. There's certain things that like, they're, they're almost like, it's almost like science, religion, you know. So there's certain subjects that are, aren't even open to scrutiny.

Speaker 3:          00:19:50       Well I think that's right. And I think part of it is, is also we have gotten to a point where you can't, and I don't know how you walk it back, but you can't have conflicting ideas in the same statement or the same sentence and an idea. Things conflict all the time. Right. And you can have a truths that collide with each other and don't. I don't necessarily make sense. So. But it seems as if now everything has to be an absolute and whether it's climate change, so you can't say, you know, if you, if you just have this middle of the road, you know, discussion where you're saying, well look, of course, you know, humans I'm sure have some impact. I don't know what that is. And then, and you know, this is a problem, then we do have to do our part and we do have to work to, to try to be the best we can be.

Speaker 3:          00:20:34       But that's not good enough. You've got to, you've got to be a sort of totalitarian about the whole issue. And it's not just that it's, it's any argument, it just seems as if, and it's not just a millennial, so I'm not wanting to, to beat on, you know, the young kids or the generation of whatever we want to call them nowadays because I know a lot of good kids that are out there that are working hard or they're in the military and it's a fantastic group of folks. So I think we're just fine in that regard. But there does seem to be something about each successive generation and we've gotten to a point where people have a hard time processing this dissenting opinion idea and that starts to shut down debate and it starts to shut down the idea that you can have a discussion about science, where you have, you know, these conflicting ideas and how do you, how do you resolve them? That used to be the whole concept about sciences to test theories and with little works and anyway,

Speaker 4:          00:21:27       what do I think? It's because we're attaching egos and personalities and virtue signaling to the actual hard data itself, but here's, here's the thing that we should all be concerned with. Pollution. We should all be concerned with human waste. We should all be concerned with the damage that we're doing to our water, the damage that we're doing to the environment, the. There's a host of different things that human beings are involved in that are creating irreparable harm to the environment. We should absolutely be concerned with that, but what's weird is that you hardly ever hear about that. You hardly ever hear about doing something to curb the plastic in the ocean and doing something to eliminate that. Some of the sewage waste that goes into the ocean doing the, oh, there's a ton of different things that we're doing that are huge issues, but instead you hear about climate change and it becomes this ideological left versus right battle, which is very weird to me. And I understand that climate change is a real issue and if the ocean water continues to rise, coastal cities really are fucked and if the temperature does rise, we really might have to migrate to more better climates. But there's a lot of other shit going on that seems to get ignored during this process. Just,

Speaker 3:          00:22:36       I mean, I, you know, I'm old enough to remember when a plastics that was an issue, right? Plastic bags or, or um, you know, keeping the oceans clean or you know, don't be a little bug. I mean, was, it was more of a, it was things that you could accomplish, right? It was things that you could do with the community. Could do. So you would have these community drive to pick up trash or to not use plastic bags or to whatever it is, and it was stuff that you could do and you could see some results and it felt good about it. And you know, who knows, maybe we've gone past that now. And so now, uh, that's not good enough because, you know, now we've got to save the planet. Will you save the planet these little steps at a time, right? If every, every community says, well, you know, I'm sorry I can't do anything about the polar bears, so fuck it. I'm just going to worry about myself. But if you, if you bring it back down to those little things like you would, you know, maybe implying that I think we're better off. Right? And eventually you, you do make a difference. But if all you do is talk about climate change and save the planet, people just get overwhelmed. It's like a lot of other things in life and you're just thinking, fuck it. I'm just gonna focus on other shit. It was just so strange to

Speaker 4:          00:23:45       climate change. It's become this weird ideological debate between the left and the right, and is it when it comes to plastic, there's a solution that's been around for years for plastic. There's biodegradable hemp plastic. It's existed for a long time. If they just legalized hemp farming nationwide, federally let people grow hemp in mass quantities. You could turn that into plastic. You would never have to worry about water bottles again. You'd never have to worry about garbage bags. He would never have to worry about anything because it's all be plant based plastic, which is real biodegradable. You put it in the ground, it becomes dirt. So what's the. What's the, what's the holdup? Well, federally hemp has been legal since the 19 thirties. Yeah, that's what it is. I mean, and all of that goes back to William Randolph hearst conning people into making it illegal so we didn't have to switch over his paper mills from wood son of a bitch. That son of a bitch. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:24:35       hearst. That's right. I forgot he's the guy to do that. Yeah. Wow.

Speaker 4:          00:24:39       Yeah. Amazing. Him and Harry Anslinger and you know, what they did is they organized an actual campaign against Hamp as a commodity by demonizing this thing that they called marijuana, which didn't even, it wasn't even the name of cannabis at the time that marijuana was a name for a wild Mexican tobacco. They applied that name to cannabis to say that there's this new drug that's making Mexicans and blacks rape white women and they, you know, he was a piece of Shit that William Randolph hearst and he printed all these articles and his papers and they made reefer madness and all that stuff. All those movies that they made back in the day.

Speaker 2:          00:25:16       Have you ever seen? Oh, it's wonderful. It's great. It makes me want to get high. And then, uh, and then of course they made citizen Kane and that turned her into a household name and uh, you know, relatively benign character, you, Orson Welles, I wonder what he did to Orson Welles. He must have fucked with them a little bit, don't you think? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Interesting. When we did that movie come out, citizen Kane came out in a long time. You know, people are like, why are they talking? I want to say it was the fifties. Oh, it was earlier than that I think was 19, 19, 41. Forty one. Oh, Rko pictures. Still to this day, it's an airplane. I couldn't believe I was. I was on an airplane not too long ago when I was looking to the movies together. Am I going to watch anything or am I get up?

Speaker 2:          00:26:00       And Susan Cain was on. I couldn't put, which was strange. It was right there in the middle of all these typical marvel and DC comics movies that you would expect on a plane. That's odd. So I started watching it and the, uh, the dude next to me in the seat next to me kind of starts, you can tell when someone's watching your screen over there finally attachment of the show. And he says, what are you watching? And he was you. He was probably a couple of years younger than me, but not much. And I said, I watch citizen Kane. Never heard of it. Never, never heard of it. I wish, I guess no big deal. Fine. But you know, Jerry Lewis died and people are probably saying, who's that? He's like, probably one of those dudes at the gym. It talks too much. He's one of those guys that comes up to you while you're benching. I'm gonna. Ask a question,

Speaker 4:          00:26:44       am I doing this right? Or even where I still go, you should drop your shoulder a little bit with those fucking guys because what you'll do is you'll stress that and then that'll be better for you and you'll. Okay. Thank you. Love those guys. They use big words. Try to convince you they know what they're talking about. So speaking of a citizen Kane and Orson Welles and conspiracies, last night I rewatched the episode of Geraldo Rivera is good night America when they introduced the Zapruder because you know, Dick Gregory just died. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They introduced this approved or film to the American public, uh, 13 years or 12 years, 12 years after Kennedy's assassination. And uh, then I went and read that paper, the articles. That was the printed a couple of weeks ago that, uh, you even tweeted about it, about the CIA questioning the official story of the JFK assassination. Yeah. Yeah. That was interesting, wasn't it? Yeah. So the CIA guy, what do you think about that? Well, first of all, that's approved of film.

Speaker 2:          00:27:43       That's the most watched piece of film in history of film has a really, which is really interesting. Um, but, uh, yeah, it was interesting that the, you know, as typical with a lot of these things that the headline doesn't necessarily actually match once you get into the body of the story, but the idea being that the agency had some concerns over the idea that perhaps a Cuba was behind the assassination was the Russians to some degree or some more likely in a combination of the two. Um, look, I think, you know, I do, I think that, uh, that, uh, he could have taken that shot. Yeah, it was, it was. Yeah, it was not. I said I've been up in that book depository from that point of view, that vantage point. We did a story on the, on the, uh, the whole, uh, issue that conspiracy theory and what could have happened.

Speaker 2:          00:28:34       Then we tried to find some new witnesses and, you know, could he have made that shot? Yeah. That was, that was, it was a straightforward, you know, effort was someone who had some training. He was, you know, he wasn't the world's best shot, but he had sufficient training to make that shot. No, that's separate from his motivations and any potential support that he may have gotten a during the course of that. And, you know, I think that he, in his mind, he, he genuinely felt that this was going to get him into the revolution, right. That this was going to. It had a very unhappy experience in Russia when he was over there living, came back, um, saw what was happening in Cuba, desperately wanted to be part of that, uh, took an unexplained trip down to Mexico. Uh, which could well have been in an effort to find somebody who could support his, his desire to, to take some sort of action whether he had formed in his mind that's what he was going to do at the time or not. So, you know, is there a still a possibility that, um, the Cubans, which they're the Intel service there would have had to file on him. I mean, he was a very, very well known quantity, obviously by that time, for the Russians. The Russians

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       are solely responsible for training up the Cuban Intel service. So there's a massive file on him and they knew who they were dealing with. They knew his weaknesses, they knew his, um, they knew his motivations, they knew what to do in terms of trying to get leverageable, you know, uh, information on him. So I think that the jury's still out. I'm not, and I'm not a conspiracy guy, but I think there's enough there that says, you know, yes, it's Kinda like what we're talking about climate change. I believe this, but this also could be true. I think he could have taken that shot for sure. Uh, and, and, and succeeded, I think it's also possible that he may have had the encouragement of, in particular the Cuban Intel service through the Russians because at that time in particular they didn't do anything. The Cubans didn't do anything without the Russians support blessings and direction.

Speaker 3:          00:30:38       So that is entirely possible. Um, do I think that there were a variety of other things at play, you know, was, did they help him get the, the, the, uh, the weapon? Did they, I mean, you know, was her actual logistical support in there? I don't know. I don't think so, but that'd be on maybe. Yeah, it's, it's a, it's a fascinating thing. And you know, again, nobody wants to think that something that uh, impactful could have been just one guy who, you know, had a dream about being a hero of the revolution. And I think they just, it's, it's such an awful thing to think about. You want something bigger, you want something more behind it. And it's, it's, I will say the one thing that I think there was something else too was the Mlk, Martin Luther King assassination. Well, let's get to that for sure,

Speaker 4:          00:31:25       but here's the thing about the, the Lee Harvey Oswald assassination, you know, a lot of people think that there was people in the grassy knoll and that they shot at the president and there was more than one shooter. That's possible too. And here's the other problem with people saying that Oswald could have never made that shot. Of course he could have 100 percent he could have. Is it likely? Listen, people throw three point shots that have no fucking business on a basketball court and they hit nothing but net. It happens all the time. It doesn't mean it's not likely that a guy could get off three shots that quick, but it is possible.

Speaker 3:          00:31:58       There was more time in there than they originally thought. There been. There's some misinformation out there about how condensed that timeframe was. And now after they've, you know, research has seemed to have a fairly. Well at that timeframe extended a little bit, but he had more importantly he had. He worked up there. So he had the opportunity to see that site. Right? So he was like, he was sitting in a blind weight and then figuring out what am I going to be doing here, and that's a tremendous advantage and clear daylight targets moving right in line with you. There's no wind.

Speaker 4:          00:32:28       Not only that, it's not that far shot. No, it's not. It's not like everybody thinks it's like a half mile away or something like that. I mean how far was it? It was 150 yards or something like that to

Speaker 3:          00:32:37       go back and find that. But I've. But I've stood on that

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       spot where the limo was at the site and I stood up there and that down and it's not that far. And it's a total makeup was shot on a deer. Yeah. I'll give you. We're going to shoot a deer with a rifle. You'd be like, Oh yeah, that's definitely my effective range. No, there was no how far it would go. Two hundred and 60. Five feet. Eighty one meters. That ain't shit. That's a bowshot yeah. You could shoot an animal with a bow from 80 meters if you're really good and there's no wind. So that's a really close shot. So the idea that he couldn't make that shot, he's a bad shot. That is so fucking stupid. He absolutely could make that shot and that will look that he could make that shot from 81 meters. That's nothing. We looked at the grassy knoll issue. We looked at the end of that.

Speaker 2:          00:33:20       What, what the, the train yard engineer, um, reported seeing, um, with a sort of a puff of smoke that he thought he saw over by the fence line. And, and we're looking at like, yeah, you could, you know, from that position, they opened that place up and we were able to go back up there and you could see it. We ran a couple of tests and fired off a few shots and that's always fun if you want to have, I've got a good time to take a rifle to dealey plaza and fire off a few shots without the tourist knowing what the hell is happening. And The Dallas police by the way, were tremendous during the course of that. But, um, when did you guys do this? We did this a while back for a show called American declassified, which isn't running anymore, um, but it was on a, on the travel channel. Jesse Ventura did that. He went up there and with a mandolin incur carcanos same rifle. And I was looking for a possible shock. No one could make the shock camp.

Speaker 2:          00:34:11       I love Jesse. I think he's awesome. But you to be conspiracy significantly on that side to the point where, you know, that's he's leaning always toward the conspiracy. Yeah. Would you want to do is you want to do every investigation, and I know this company that I've got, we, we do a lot of investigations and you've got a bill just like with a homicide case or anything else. You've got to build it on stable ground, right? So you have to start from, you know, the very basics because if you start building ideas and investigative inquiries on something that's not sturdy underneath it, you know, not based on evidence and fact then you got a problem. The whole thing becomes suspect and usually comes toppling down. So, you know, I, you got to keep an open mind about all these things and I think it's important.

Speaker 2:          00:34:57       Um, right now people are like, Oh, well I'm sure that agency, the CIA was involved. So I'm a terrible source of information. I've, I've heard that before. So you can't talk credibly about this because you know, the CIA was involved in, I think he is a thing of the CIA was involved. It's not you, you weren't there. And I was 62 last time I checked. I was not there in 1962 and a. and also I will tell you this much. Or was it 63? It was 60 slash six slash 63. If the age, if the agency had been involved. This is the honest to God's truth. There's no way that secret is still kept. People can't keep their Yap shut. They can't. And secrets have a way of coming out and certainly a lot quicker now than they used to. So now. But I did

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       the secrets then. I mean we're talking about so long ago how much talking to them more than 50 years ago. Like get out. It's like the DB cooper issue, my biggest reason for believing db cooper died and his chute is hanging off a tree and that's a vast wilderness up there. Yeah. Is, is that people just, they can't help themselves at some point people talk or somebody talks somebody associated with or somebody nearby or somebody involved or somebody on their deathbed or somebody says something they shouldn't have. Um, it's, you know, the idea that they've maintained this sort of secret over a period of time. I find hard to believe I'm not discounting it. And again, you've got to leave a little space open for something that could be just amazing. But anyway, so that's, that was that. But I, yeah, I agree that shot was not, uh, was not a tough shot. One meters ain't shit and that's nothing in particular in those conditions. And I will say those conditions were ideal. Unfortunately for that event.

Speaker 4:          00:36:34       People are like, there's a video of me shooting a fucking hard drive at a hundred yards, a hard drive and you must have hit it that hard drive edge. Well, we getting rid of some hard yards, thought it'd be fun to take it to the rifle range, so I'd take it to the rifle and obviously we're dealing with modern rifles are probably more accurate, but I'm shooting something that's basically two inches high, laying it down on the ground at a hundred yards and blown to smithereens. That's how accurate a rifle is at a hundred yards. You tell me he couldn't get a headshot at 81 meters. That's crazy.

Speaker 3:          00:37:06       Again, no, she caught wind. Of course he could go to light. Did he go with he? That's really the question is, you know, we have some pretty good indication as to what he was thinking and what is obviously what his motivations were and that's important.

Speaker 4:          00:37:19       It definitely was in with the Russians definitely was involved in a lot of weird shit with communism. Who knows what his entire full background was because there was a lot of covert shit going on.

Speaker 3:          00:37:30       Did he? Did he express a desire to do something like this to the Russians at some point and they know that, okay, well here's an interesting opportunity, right? Yeah. They would have, they would have sparked on that and they would have thought about it. They would, they have actually, you know, play on words intended, but would they have pulled the trigger on an operation trying to push him into doing an act like this indirectly through the Cubans. Exactly.

Speaker 4:          00:37:54       Especially if like this crazy fuck Mike, go ahead and do this for us. So after the Bay of Pigs, people have to realize there was a lot of people pissed off at Kennedy, we lost

Speaker 3:          00:38:02       bullshit. Hated Buddy. Christian hated Kennedy. Yeah. And so,

Speaker 4:          00:38:06       well that infamous video where he's banging his shoe down on the table. We will bury you.

Speaker 3:          00:38:10       Yeah. Yeah, no, it was, it was the, the environment was right for them and they. And again, the Russians. It shouldn't be a surprise to anybody when you talk about what they did during this election. I mean they've been doing this forever. There you go. Back to the 19 forties and the Russians, were you spending a lot of time and effort and money here in the states trying to keep us out of the war? Back before Hitler invaded Russia, when they were allied with the Nazi still, so they spent a lot of time. They set up independent association. Supposedly

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       they paid off a lot of unions and union members, a journalists. I mean they were doing everything they could create this or to strengthen the idea of isolationism just to keep us out. They've been doing this for as long as they've been around. So anybody who says, well, I can't. You know, it's, it's shocking. The Russians will be engaged in this is. It's ridiculous. They've always been. Again, we by the way have been engaged doing that with them. What? That's what I hear. Fine. I've heard that online. I find that hard to leave. The thing that bothers me the most about the Kennedy assassination is the universal support for the magic bullet theory. I think that fucking bullet is ridiculous. I've shot things. I've shot a lot of things. I know what happens to bullets. Everybody that I know that's a marksman, everybody knows it's a hunter.

Speaker 2:          00:39:16       They see a bullet that has hit bone. It fucking never looks like that. When a bullet goes through to people and comes out looking like you shot it into a pool of water, that's what it looks like. I don't buy that at all. And the convenience of finding it on Connolly's Gurney and they enroll them into the hospital. Oh look guys, we found the bullet. Got It. And it's perfect. God, I don't buy that for a second. And the problem is there's more metal fragments in connally's body. Then we're missing from the bullet itself. I think that bullet itself, look at that bullet. Get the caddy. That thing didn't hit shit. Uh, it's exactly right. The conditioned with this with people that have never shot guns. And they go, well actually proven that broke bones and a bullet breaks bones. They get fucked. Melissa jacketed bullets.

Speaker 2:          00:40:02       When it's jacketed bullets breaks bones. It gets fucked. You're talking about something that's going. I mean, how fast is a bullet from that rifle go. It's got to be that. It would be interesting thing to pull up, but I would imagine it's in the thousands of feet per second. It's got to be. When it hits bone, it's going to it as well. There's always distortion. Even if you're. I mean, so I don't know when you have a conversation about this and it is somebody who has no shooting experience or you know, it just, I think. All right, that's fine. I understand why you're fascinated by it, but do, when you do your research, you know, it's, it's like with news, read everything, right? Read The Wall Street Journal, read The New York Times, read the Financial Times, read, read the economist. I read everything. Yes. Before you form your opinion. Right? And, and, and everybody is so siloed nowadays and you get the same thing with conspiracy theories.

Speaker 2:          00:40:51       I absolutely believe this and I'm not going to, I'm going to discount everything else that's out there and, or just not pay any attention to it. Um, yeah. But it's hard to say. And here's another thing, the magic bullet path. People like, well, how is that possible? Well, let me tell you something that's the most believable thing about the magic bullet. There is the path of the bullet because bullets do wacky shit when they hit bone and you can't predict it at all. I know a guy who, uh, in Iraq, they shot a guy in the head from the front and it went out as eyeball. The bullet came out of his eyeball back forward. It ricocheted inside of his skull and came out as I know you can't. I mean, again, you can't put you right, you can't predict it. They'll try to model these things and figure out a way, but you know, there's an unknown there.

Speaker 2:          00:41:36       And so yeah, I agree. I mean, I think that again, it's, it's one of those things where it, it, it's never going to get resolved and it, it's going to continue to live on because a, it was such an important event in the history of the country. And B, it's, I keep going back to that same thing. People don't want to believe that really awful shit can happen sometimes in a very simple, straightforward way. And so it's much easier to think it was a broad base conspiracy. There were lots of moving parts, sometimes bad shit happens and it's just as simple as it seems that is possible. Conversely, people don't like to believe in conspiracies, especially when it's involved in an assassination of president. Right. You know the reason why they came up with the whole magic bullet theory in the first place is pretty shady in the first, in fact, the reason why they did it because the guy got hit by a ricochet underneath the overpass and they blamed that bullet on one of the, one of the shots from Lee Harvey Oswald and the book depository.

Speaker 2:          00:42:32       So they said, well, all right, so now we have less bullets that could have hit Kennedy. We have all these wounds and we have to attribute a series of wounds to one bullet. Right? Right. So that was the thought process behind it. But this is approved. Or film was the one that got people weirded out by it. But I'll tell you about men. I've watched that film a bunch of times and one of the things that don't jive is if he did get hit from the front, you know, head goes back to the left. Why is the blood spray out forward? See, it's, it's, it's weird the way the impact of the blood is, the blood sprays forward and then his head goes back into the left. It could have possibly been that he was hit from the front end, the back at the same time.

Speaker 2:          00:43:11       That's entirely possible. I mean, that is a tactic you would do, right? You would roll someone into an area where they would be in a crossfire and they'd get shot if they came in. If there was, if the grass, you know, it was in fact a second site for a shooter. Then by the time it hits that corner and starts its path just before the shots were fired from the book depository and Oswald, if you, if you're going with that, if you had an another shooter up on the grass, you know, you're, you are basically looking right at the, the, uh, the, the, the front of the vehicle. And because of the way that it's positioned in the nols kind of turned and then it's just that, it's just that there's not a lot of concealment up there. And they had that. They had the fence, picket fence.

Speaker 2:          00:44:01       It's not the original one that Sarah anymore, but it's basically in line with it. And you can see there's plenty of pictures of the. Oh, the previous fence, it was up there at the time. Um, and you had that, you did have the train yard engineer report sometime after the fact that he saw a puff of smoke and he wasn't quite sure what that was all about and he'd seen a couple of people back there so that, you know, that was, that's an interesting thread to pull on. Right. And, and I think that, that it's been, it's been ad nauseum doesn't mean that you couldn't still find something. It also doesn't mean anybody's going to really find a conclusion after the fact. Right. Firstly, today. Yeah. No. And that's right. And you know, maybe it's like everything else, as time marches on, you lose, you lose witnesses, you lose, you know, people that were there on site and even witnesses when someone gets shot.

Speaker 2:          00:44:50       No, especially with the precedent is not credible. Five different stories from five different people and gunshots heard from the moon. Nobody will get that just from a robbery, just straight driving in a car accident you'd say you'd say, what did you see? If you have separate people out, you're right, you'll get five different versions from five different people and you know, so yeah, I wasn't a witness accounts. I tend not to be a particularly a credible and you've got to, you know, you, you, you got to take them and then you gotta match it up with other information that you can, you can pull together forensically. But it's a, it is fascinating. I know who knows where it's going to DB Cooper's back in the news a little bit because it really. Yeah. Yeah. They've uh, initially it was because the bureau was saying, okay, we're, we're closing this case.

Speaker 2:          00:45:31       And then there's some talk now over the past day and a half, two days that they might've found something up in the wilderness that might be a piece of the shoot that he had. And I know they haven't, they haven't bought them that one out yet. But Cooper, more new evidence of parachute believed, found. But how they know that's his parachute. Yeah. The thing about, I mean, it could be, but the thing about something that's that long ago, we have to realize how many people die in the woods every year. Yeah. Yeah. And when you go, when you come out the back of that plane, I'm good luck. Yeah. And, and also he was in a suit. He was wearing loafers. He lost his shoes. So he hits those, that wilderness. He hits those trees and uh, it was cold that night and it was wet. And there's going to be a man hunt on, in the morning.

Speaker 2:          00:46:18       No, he had his, he had his, he had his, um, a parachute and he had the bag with the money. They'd given him money. So. And that, that was it. And so I'm no wilderness gear at all. No. Well not that they know of. I mean, who knows, maybe underneath his business suit he was wearing something, but I'm just going to be wearing. So what was the time of the year? Uh, it was late in the year I think. I think I have to go back and check again, but I think it was November, I want to say part of the country up in the, uh, the wilderness up in Washington state. Oh, he's dead before thanksgiving. Before thanksgiving. Yeah. That guy's dead. Yeah. I mean it's just not going to make you make your way out of there. And it's nighttime and you know that. And, and you know, they again, there's going to be a manhunt starting.

Speaker 2:          00:47:01       No, let's. Trout wouldn't survive up there, but there's been all sorts of theories. Oh, he jumped out and then some people met them. Well, maybe good luck finding them. Right. How are you going to be able to be so silly? People jumping out of an airplane with no gps. Do the odds of finding that guy and he's not, he doesn't have a flare. Like what does, what does he have? How are you going to look at? I'm going to just find him in the woods. That's why I think there's, you know, there was some talk, well, you know, because some of his money was found, um, you know, after the fact stacked in a, in a little, uh, a part of the river that seemed unusual, right? It seemed like it would have had to make a pretty amazing journey from the wilderness down through the stream system out to the river and then be found on this sandbar and it was all stacked one on top of the other, but it had the light, it had the serial numbers.

Speaker 2:          00:47:51       And so there was some thought that, you know, how did that get there? Did it naturally just float down there and ended up on the sandbar and covered in Santa. Eventually was found by some kid that was on a picnic. Whoa. You know, I'm wondering if that's slowly, how long would it take for you get busted. And that was $200,000 back in the day, a little bit here and there. Now buy a bicycle. Seems good by TV. No one saying nothing but bicycle. These little kid, you know my way to California where the weather's coming, room's got a 50 inch tv with the fuck's going on. You don't even have a job be what the hell are you doing? Where did you get that transistor radio? Well, if it's a kid who found it, I'm sure I see what you're saying. Yeah, yeah, no, he reported the kid was with his family and he reported finding Amelie.

Speaker 2:          00:48:39       That bureau went out there and dug up the entire area and in a fairly large effort trying to figure out what is there more money there? How did it get there? Run tests. I think if they found his money, he's dead. It's not going to jump out of a parachute and then leave the money. There was some thought that maybe he was doing it as a ploy, right? To, to kind of distract and think, okay, he's dead because the money's there. Uh, but again, it falls into the category of, you know, it's never going to be resolved, I don't think. And it's a fascinating story. It's Americans only on solved hijacking. Am I right about that? I think Americans only unsolved does it all the money. Did they find all of it or what? It was just a small amount. It was not, it was not a large amount.

Speaker 2:          00:49:17       So he did not. If he, if he planted the theory was smart enough not to put it all their weird story. That db cooper one's a weird one because a lot of people, they tend to look at him like some sort of a folk hero. There was a connection with him that they were, they were thinking he was this guy who up, I want to say shot family members and murdered family members and then went out and did that crime. There was some suspect that was on the loose from some sort of a homicide that they connected to the DB cooper case and they thought that somehow there was a potential that they were related, that it was the same guy. Yeah, he loses some of his charm. If that's the case. Yeah, it'd be just a guy that's, you know, thinking I'm going to hijack a plan for some cash.

Speaker 2:          00:50:00       And where'd he get the money? Where did the cash come from? They brought it on the plane and they landed and then they gave him the money that they got the passengers and the most of the crew off of there. And then everybody was in the cockpit with the door closed when the, in the old days in the back door would open up the steps and he went out the back door. They had a backdoor indicator, which is how they kind of sensed about where he would have gone out. And uh, anyway, I sound like a db cooper. So how high was he up there when he jumped again? I have to go through my notes, but I think commercial flight. No. Oh No, no, no, no, no, they, they dropped down to, I want to say about 10,000 feet. I can't remember, but they're not really sure because the door came down.

Speaker 2:          00:50:44       He could've been there for any period of time and he had instructed them to drop down. I forget again what altitude he was head, but you know, it's just, it's amazing that these things continue to go on and we love mysteries. I love mysteries and conspiracies and uh, which is why the new trump administration is so interesting. Well, he loves conspiracies, doesn't he? He believes a bunch of crazy ones. Like he was just a retweet that one about, um, what was the general that uh, they, they attraction to pershing dip in the pigs. Uh, the bullets in pig's blood. Yeah. And there was never an attack, uh, Islamic attack at 35 years. That's not even a true story. Know who? But again, who, why? Why aren't you doing this? Why it just stop? Yeah, it does. There's no, there's no like, I didn't vote for him.

Speaker 2:          00:51:29       I didn't vote for her. I, I just thought we could have done better in a country this size. Right. Tell you one thing he's doing. He's fucking it up for future idiots. Idiots. Oh No, no. I would not underestimate our ability to hire somebody worse. I'm never going to be as someone like maybe there'll be like a new version of him, like someone like him, but they dial it back a little bit. Yeah, yeah. Maybe so. I just think people always say, well, this will be a course correction and we're going to go back to having really respond and I'm thinking, wow, this is America. Don't, don't, don't, don't imagine that it could actually get better in that regard. We could be even more dysfunctional from a political point of view, but what's weird is I was watching this interview today where this guy is fucking pencil neck dork was supporting and Tif of violence and saying that the only way to fight against fascism is violence.

Speaker 2:          00:52:20       And I was like, oh Jesus. And then there was this other guy next to him who was saying, no, that's not true. The way you fight it is with a peaceful protest like just happened in Boston. Like that's the best way to handle it. Where there was, I want to say there was more than 100,000 people in Boston wasn't there was how many people in Boston came out. Let's see if we could find that out, and it was completely peaceful in the the. I think there was like 400 retards with KKK banners. It's a small, small group of assholes and you're like, okay, but here's the thing. This is where, this is where the, you know, president trump has just such a. he's a great case study at some point, I'm sure. Well, I'm sure people are already, you know, writing up their grant proposals to do a study on, on his psychology. But you know, you look at, you look at at the first amendment and you think if you like the first amendment, then you got to be all in, right? It's not like you can say, and that's the kind of the beauty of this country. You got to let that a douchebag speak. Right? And that's what it is. It's speech. But we've gotten to the point now

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       words some by some folks are viewed as violence. Words aren't violence. I don't think. This is just my own personal opinion. Boards on violence, you gotta let everybody speak because that's the first amendment. You, you'd go down and they don't want to pick and choose in slope, slippery slope. Right? And so, you know, we, we can all agree that there is no space for them. They're assholes, but there's also no space for violent counter demonstration. There is space for protesting it because it's, they're absolutely wrong. Right? I mean, that's, that's again, this idea that you, how you should be able to argue both, right? No, you can't respond with violence and yes, you guys, you shouldn't, you shouldn't be here. If you're going to hold those views, that's, it's important. You are protected by the first amendment and so that's fine. Doesn't mean we have to like it or in any way condone it, but, but you get an okay that those sort of fringe ideas are going to exist. And I agree the best way to resolve it is peaceful demonstrations, massive pieces does demonstrations to show, you know, sort of the weight of where the good thoughts are and then a political process, right. And sure that, you know, work through the political system as dysfunctional as it may be. But anyway, uh,

Speaker 4:          00:54:49       just encouraging people to violently attack people that have differing ideas in them that aren't being violent is never the answer. No, it's just not the way to do it. And that's just the approach to. Yes, you're right, it takes a fascist approach. Yeah. I mean literally you're enforcing your ideas to the point where you're silencing others with actual violence.

Speaker 3:          00:55:10       The mark of a totalitarian state also is if you say you can't have these views, will get that to hate those views. But again, it's the idea that what you say is violent to me. No, it's not. It's fucking speech. The other thing that trump fucked up, he called those protesters. Anti violent protesters. Like anti-police protesters. Yeah. Like, come on

Speaker 4:          00:55:31       man. That is not what they're protesting against police. There might be a few amongst them that say stupid shit.

Speaker 3:          00:55:39       But, but again, just like with the other side where you've got what do you, what do you got? A $100, $200. Who would imagine $15,000? What the fuck are these Nazis hiding? Anyway, that's it. That's the thing. You know, my dad didn't, didn't fly in World War Two, you know, so that somehow you could have a resurgent, not that there is, I think it's a small group just like it's a small group on the left that wants a violence solution to this or you know, honestly believes that violence against police is somehow the answer, which is insane. But, um, again, there you go. Truth is somewhere in the middle, right? I mean, they've got to get rid of the fringe and you know, we got to figure out a way for the folks that are in Canada. Summoned space. Yeah. I have to work together. Otherwise, I mean a, I don't think the Democrats care whether Republicans gave.

Speaker 3:          00:56:31       In fact they are, they're happy. That shit's not getting done. But as an American, again, I didn't vote for him. I didn't vote for her, but I would like to see the government work now. Who did you vote for? A. You know what? I just said, fuck it. I can't. I couldn't youtube. I know I couldn't bring myself to do it. I couldn't bring us and I hated doing that. Right. Because I voted top down right now, what they call it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, I, what I did was I, you know, state elections important, you know, those sort of. And that's fine, but it, it, uh, it's very painful to say I can't, you know, can't justify doing that and uh, and I know people and then people lose their minds and they go, well, that means you have voted for him or that means.

Speaker 3:          00:57:10       And I know it just means we should have been able to do better in a country this size, you know, and um, you know, maybe maybe you hold your nose and vote for the other side. I don't know. Um, but at least she represented a conventional approach to politics. That's true. There's no doubt about that. That's super conventional. I don't enjoy a lot of aspects of her personality and what she's done with her career and the obvious deception. The Clinton Foundation, which is just riddled with problems and now doesn't even exist anymore. Apparently they shut it down to wonder what they did with the remaining balance as a horror is flying in from Russia. What are we going to deal with this? We got all this money. We're got to transfer it somewhere. There's got to be a place to store it in my pants, wad up hundreds stuff and I'm in his past.

Speaker 3:          00:58:07       He was, he was in a marriage or is. I guess he's not dead yet, so I don't want to kill them off, but he's, he's, he's an amazing political individual. That guy could make you think that, you know, I met him once overseas is sounds dodgy, but in the Saudi at a, a party that does sound really sketching and so. But he had that ability right now again, I wasn't a fan. That's, but I, you know, again, you just want whichever administration is in charge. You want it to work you from country to move forward. But yeah. But so you met him in it and it's true what people used to say about them, which is that he made you feel like he was talking right to you and nothing else was important. Right. He wasn't one of those guys that looks over their shoulder thinking, ms dot somebody else. I should be talking to over there and he was a charmer friend of mine told me he was talking to him and a woman though and Clinton like essentially almost turned his back to him and like all the horse out of the picture. Then he just pressed gun. I'm just gonna Block you right here. So these honors, I got a stack name a pockets man in a party. A party in Saudi. Get drunk

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       with that dude. Yeah, I'll tell you what's. I mean George Bush. That'd be a guy like to sit down and have a beer with the Bush family. Good bunch. But I know people that go, oh my God, I couldn't stand with policies. But you know, sometimes you just, it comes down to a personal thing and you think, yeah, you know, maybe the guy's got some, you know you made. I like his principles. You may have, but he sticks with them. Right? He looks extremely reasonable now. Yeah, exactly right. One time where the supreme court had a ruling that he didn't like and there was a speech where he gave in the. I've seen it quoted in print and then someone showed a video of it, but he was essentially saying, well, you know, we have to uphold the decision of the court, you know, I'm not happy with it, but you know, this is uh, the way our system works.

Speaker 2:          01:00:03       And then it went to trump talking about the supreme court, you know, not backing his travel ban and all the different various things that he's lost in court and he just goes out and he just said, and I just like the personal attacks and there's no product, there's no discipline in the White House. And, and I know that everybody thought, well, let's get something different in there. Let's get a businessman. Let's, we don't want the politics as usual. And well you got that, but there is a requirement. There is a need for the machine to work in a certain fashion and in a sense. And yet, you know, yes, there's lots of things you can change and that that's a good thing. There should be some change in the government, but the way the place works in Washington, but the communications there that the lack of discipline, I mean for crying out loud, they just, they just put in place the new communications director at the White House, 28 years old.

Speaker 2:          01:00:51       She's 28 years old, never done this sort of thing before. And she's the new communications director. She replaced Scaramucci for his 10 days of rain. And why did she, um, wanted to replace him? Because she listens. She's just willing to do what trump says. He just said, yeah, I'm here for the job. I mean, she says you're the girl for, you know, for this. And she's, she's worked within the trump organization and I guess just viewed as loyal. Loyal. Yeah. That's what he needs. Yeah. He needs loyalty above all else. Yeah. And so, so that's it, but I mean, there's no consistency and you see these things happen. You'll see, you know, these, the messaging get out and he gets ahead of the message or they need to play catch up then. And people like Madison, John Kelly now and Pompeo and others are trying to race to make sense of some of these things and they just self inflicted wound after, after wound for this, this administration, it seems like one of those homemade derby carts that they rolled down the hill where you know, the wheels aren't going to stay on and you kinda can't look away.

Speaker 2:          01:01:52       Like, wow, how long is it going to take for this thing completely falls apart, start doing tumbles down the hill. You got a name, they get it. You got to come up with a name for that cart is have the name, your soapbox derby cars. But um, yeah, I, I don't, I don't know where it's going to go. I just think I'm the guy who has been in the intelligence community for so many years and you're stepping back and there was also a real issue with him being at odds with the intelligence community and diminishing the intelligence community. Yeah. That was a strange error. Sort of an interesting narrative. It didn't really. It got overblown to some degree. I mean the people in the sense that the people at the agency, you know, at the end of the day, they just take whoever's in charge. They take their marching orders from, right.

Speaker 2:          01:02:34       It's not, and I know people don't believe it because you know, everybody likes to feature films and everything, but it's, it's a pretty apolitical organization. Whoever's in the administration, they're going to prioritize their national security concerns. You're tasking comes out of that and then you just march on and do your job. And yes, the is an appointed position and you know, John Brennan was certainly much more political in the previous administration than, than a previous directors have been. But, and the operational level, the street level people just get on with it, you know, they're human. So of course, you know, they may have their own personal preference, but I spent a long time. They're in behind the curtain and, and you know, they just tick on and do whatever. You know. There were people that weren't happy with Obama. There are people that weren't happy with Bush to people not happy with trump.

Speaker 2:          01:03:18       That doesn't just tell us what the priorities are, tell us what the task is and we'll get on with it, you know, go out there and do the collection operations we're supposed to do. It just seems like there's no one person that's ever going to be able to fill that position. It seems like that position also gets bigger and bigger, like the responsibilities get bigger and bigger and the president's. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just, it seems to me that at this point in our, our, our history, the history of our society, we kind of have to look at that position and wonder whether or not it's even logical to give so much power to one person. It was like, what would you do? I mean, how do you have a good question? Yeah. How do you create a Council of Elders Council?

Speaker 2:          01:04:02       Everybody sits around like a hand carved desk in a underground layer and makes decisions. That's a good. Yeah, I like it. Yeah. It could be like the knights of the round table, but I think it's. Yeah. You know, I don't know. I think virtuous people by committee. I wonder if the founding fathers, you know, I'm sure there's been all, you know, reporting on that, I just never read it, but the founding fathers, have they considered that as an option, as an option? Probably not, but a wonderful committee. The kind of population growth that we've experienced here, the real problem with the founding fathers is as brilliant as they were. There's no way that could have ever seen the internet coming now, and this is what could they have seen the people wanting to stay in Washington for 36 years, 42 years. I've become career politicians.

Speaker 2:          01:04:42       They were all just interested in, in, you know, doing their duty and serving the way they were supposed to or they felt obligated to and then getting the hell out. Right. Getting back to the farm or whatever that job was because nobody wanted to stay in Washington for any longer than they needed to. So yeah, you're right. They could, they have foreseen all. No, definitely not. And so does that mean, what does that mean though? It means amendments to the Constitution and as we've done in the past and think about how crazy it is that someone forms a new country and then 400 plus years later, it is the preeminent superpower in the world by far. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:05:18       that's pretty crazy. You got these countries that have been around for thousands and thousands of years, like imagine a group of freaks and misfits that branch off from America, getting a boat and float over to Costa Rica or wherever and take it over. Yeah. And then, uh, and then it becomes the superpower.

Speaker 3:          01:05:35       It is astounding. And then again, going back to what we talked about towards the beginning was cobbling it together and understanding that we needed to get our hands on everything west of the Mississippi. Now, clearly there were some issues there, but you know, it's sort of that vision that says we're going all the way to the causeway. The water we have to. It was, we can control it. Right. And that's, I mean, it's, it's, it's an astounding history. You're absolutely right. Um, but, you know, it'll be interesting to see. Obviously this is the probably the stupidest statement people will hear it all day is, is you know where we're going to be in say another 200 years because I've got a theory that says we're. Every generation is making it easier for their kids and eventually you hit a point of diminishing returns and everybody's just a big pussy and so that's my theory. I haven't come up with a name for it. You're not alone. Yeah, a big pussy pussy. That's. That could cover different things. So yeah. Plus that was great. That was a great show.

Speaker 4:          01:06:30       Wonder. Yeah. I wonder how much there's going to be. There are parts of the world where obviously things are way more difficult than are here and maybe we're losing some sort of a competitive edge because we've made our lives so easy and haven't replaced the convenience of civilization with something that tempers are human instincts, like some difficult tasks, right? Of passage for young men, you know, something that develops character. Instead we're making safe spaces and making words, violence and you know, making it so we have trigger warnings and

Speaker 3:          01:07:05       no winters. Winter when we don't have to, when, thank God my kids are getting old enough now where their sports leagues no longer, you know, for awhile there I was just driving me crazy. So it was parent go into a game and realizing that they weren't keeping score because they didn't want to hurt anybody's feelings. That's the whole reason why people get better. You fucked me. And while the kids are keeping score, the kids know for sure and kids don't want you to blow smoke up their ass, right? You don't want to. They'd come off the court and if you know the, the oldest boy a scooter, he 10 years old and he's, he plays a lot of Lacrosse. He's been playing for five years and so he's, he really likes it. And he does. He does well. But you know, I'm not raising the Division One champion there, right?

Speaker 3:          01:07:45       But he plays other sports too. So there's sort of a well roundedness day. But we came off the field one day and we were walking along and, and uh, they, all, the parents were kind of marching off and the game was over and he says, he says, how'd I do? And I said, well, you know, you could've done better. Um, I said, I just get the impression you didn't try as hard as you could, what do you think? And he looked at me, irritated. He looked at me like, I can't believe you didn't just say I did great. And so he said what? And I looked at him, I'm walking and I didn't realize the parents were within earshot. And I said, well look, you know, school, do you want me to blow smoke up your ass? Do you want me to be honest with you? And to his credit, he said, be honest with me even though it wasn't happy about it, the honesty. So you just be honest with me. And so we, we tell kids that they know better. You know, if you tell a kid that they're great and they're doing wonderful and they didn't, what do they take away from that? They take away from it that you're kind of bullshitting them unless they're just super, super young. They're pretty. They get it at a pretty early age.

Speaker 4:          01:08:45       Well, here's, here's something that's important to relate to children that you are not your accomplishments. You are you, and the only way you're going to get better at accomplishing things is to be 100 percent honest about the amount of effort you put in and what the actual result of that effort is. Whether it's a failure or a success that does not define you, that defines your participation in this particular activity. It is not you. You are an individual that will hopefully learn from all of your endeavors, but you're never going to learn shit if you lie to yourself. He never going to learn shit. If somebody makes this nobody's scores employment and there are no winners and there are no losers and everybody's amazing that that's not good because it gives voice. By the way, it's not good because there's going to be people out there that are fucking driven and psychotic and they're going to get ahead.

Speaker 4:          01:09:38       There's people that are task oriented and goal oriented it and they they have an idea ahead of them are going to try to figure out how to make this happen. They have a goal, they want to reach it, and if you're competing with that person in any form of life and they're not burdened down by the bullshit that we give so many kids today, they're going to have a massive advantage and this idea that this kid who's been coddled and treated like he's always going to be a winner, that somehow or another they're going to be happier is fucking crazy. Kid can't process what's true and what's not and the kid can't process criticism, constructive criticism, right? You don't just stand there and berate you're kid. Of course. That's just as bad as the other. Yeah. No, absolutely. The guys that stand on it and everybody's seen them. Right. That the Dads, sometimes moms that stayed on the sideline and berate their kid because kids jeopardizing his scholarship to some more on school. Yeah, morons, but no, I think

Speaker 3:          01:10:31       you're absolutely right. They've got. The sooner they're able to assess that, that equation effort, a end result and compare it to what's going on around them and then understand it. I'm gonna say what am I? And then one of my boys, you know, they play basketball and they enjoy it, but it's not their primary activity right now. So they tried out for a year and they got and um, but not at the top team and they were upset about not being placed on this top team. And I said, you don't, I did. And I didn't say it quite this way, but my, my, my point was, you don't deserve

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       to be on the top 10 because you're not working as hard as those kids that are working hard. And that's their thing. They wanted to be there. And so they put in the effort, you are happy playing and you could, you could be there, but you're not doing it yet. And so therefore, you know, hey, don't get down on yourself, but b, don't certainly don't get down on anybody else because they put out the effort and they accomplished something that you didn't. So you know, you always trying to find that balance. It's just I don't, we're not doing our kids any favors right now. I just think we're, we're not, not obviously as a broad brush statement, but in general terms, I think society is not doing us any favors. We're in and you see that I've got a daughter that's in college and she talks about her, you know, her classmates and others and you know, sort of the conversations they have in class and the discussions and what passes as debate nowadays, which is not much right.

Speaker 2:          01:12:09       The idea of the old debate where you can, you can voice your opinions and they can be different than somebody else's and you can hash it out and you can have a winner and a loser, but that's fine. You Go away and you come back the next day and you have another rousing debate in that class doesn't really exist. You know, it seems like anyway, because everybody's so afraid of saying something that might be offensive or not offensive, but just might be upsetting. And there's a difference between being upsetting and being offensive. We're trying to serve the world. I mean that really was what we're trying to. All the hard edges that you might bruise yourself on. We're trying to push a, put a cushion, but you need to understand that when you fall down, it's going to hurt so that way next time you're thinking you might fall down, you'll correct your path because the whole reason why people do difficult things, you do difficult things to understand your boundaries, to understand your limitations, and then to try to improve those, try to raise the roof on your expectations, raised the roof on your, your, your, whatever.

Speaker 2:          01:13:03       Limitations of your abilities, learn from whatever those are and improve. It's like interrogation training. You would an interrogation training when you're working with people. Um, the goal is to show them that it's okay. At some point they're going to have to talk, right? And so when you're going through the training, the point of it is to get them to that point. They realized that, okay, you know, it's not the end of the world. I know that at some point I'm going to end up talking, right? I'm going to say something, I'm going to have to do that because I can't, otherwise I'm either dead or I'm completely broken. And the idea is if you do that and then the rest of the training and, and beyond that, you're building them back up because they understand that now if, God forbid something should happen, they get picked up and there's actually an interrogation going on in the back of their mind.

Speaker 2:          01:13:46       They understand that and they're able to process it so that if they do get to that point where now, okay, I'm going to have to talk. I'm gonna have to come up with something it's going to add. And then it's not completely devastating. It doesn't, you know, leave them completely broken and they can walk back because they understand. I got to that point. I understand what my boundaries are. Uh, but I can work within that. I, I don't know where I'm going with this. So that we're seeing, are you seeing turkeys and trading like a, an agent gets interrogated, interrogation training in general for, for, for our outfit, for the military. Basically the same. We do a lot of cross training. This is not interrogating an enemy combatant, you being going through interrogation training, so what do you tell them to do? Like in that, like say if someone gets captured in Afghanistan or whatever happened, whatever bottom line is, you know, you, you, you try to avoid talking, but it depends.

Speaker 2:          01:14:36       Part of it is you've got to assess who you're dealing with, right? You've got to assess what you think their parameters are. What could be coming down the pike in other words. So how is this and that. That's part of the training too, is understanding what different groups with different places could, could mean. What would that would, that interrogation could look like, how bad it could get? So you're processing that. Part of it is understanding what it is. It's okay to give up. What are you, what are you going to say that's not going to put anything in jeopardy anybody's lives or any operation or anything in jeopardy. Part of it is, you know, you've then you've got to understand that you got to stay close to the truth. Right? The problem with it, if you know where you start getting people out on interrogations is where they can't remember what they've said and the closer you are to the truth, the easier it is to remember what you've said.

Speaker 2:          01:15:21       Right? So in these things, I mean, if it's a bad situation and you're in there day in and day out, you know, and your sleep deprivation and they're knocking around and there's no food and it's, you're gonna have, you're gonna have a hard time keeping track of even the basic things. So you know, you're trying to keep it as close to the truth as possible and as minimal as possible. You know, in terms of, of damage, you go in, you know, typically you, you've thought through all of this, it's like everything else, you do your homework ahead of time and God forbid something should happen and you know, usually it won't. But Anyway, point being is that, uh, you know, the ideas in the training portion of it, you want people to understand that, you know, everybody's got a breaking point, right? And that's just, that's the way it works.

Speaker 2:          01:16:03       And someone's summits, you know, it's here, so I'm, it's further down the road, but everybody's going to break and you don't want that to devastate the person if it should happen, you know, knock on wood. But anyway, that was apropos of nothing. Uh, no, it's important. I mean, it's an interesting topic because a mean understanding that there's going to be severe penalties and that there's going to be repercussions there. You know, this is a, this is a bad situation you're in and understanding that going in is going to help you a lot more than if you go in there from, you know, a soft. But how did world where you don't think there's going to be any adversity whatsoever. No, that's right. And that's all we're, you know. Um, just to finish that, a thought is that the interesting thing about people talked about the interrogation program that we had obviously, right? And I don't want to revisit that. And you know, the left at a very fine job of grabbing the moral high ground and saying, either you're talking to people or it's all torture, right? Um, but the point being is that even if you don't ever intend to use any enhanced interrogation

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       techniques, you don't want to tell the enemy that because once you tell them that you're constrained by the army field manual as an example, that's all you can do. Guess what? Every milk out there fighting us and wanting to harm us is carrying a copy of the army field manual in their back pocket. They don't, you know, despite despite the fact that they did for a while, they don't live in a cave. And so once they know what's coming down the pike that's gone, their incentive is gone right to talk to you. Because once you know, once you don't have that unknown, if you're not sitting in some, you know, a squat box and the temperature's up and you haven't eaten and you're thinking, what the hell they got to do to me next? You have no idea. If that's gone and you don't have that anxiety, that intense anxiety, then you're okay with it. Mentally, you get yourself to a nice happy.

Speaker 4:          01:18:04       You're comfortable. They're feeding, you know, they're just asking you questions.

Speaker 3:          01:18:07       They're just asking questions and you're, you know, you can, you can hold out for a much longer period of time and yeah, maybe there'll be some clever person working in the interrogation facility and they'll develop a personal relationship over a period of time, you know, but you know what, by then your operational information is lost. It's interest, right. And the shelf life on that stuff is, is not particularly long typically. So he had a way that says, yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:18:31       when you, when you're in a situation where you have to extract information in a very short period of time because it's critical because lives are at stake, like in taking time off and if you're stuck in some situation where someone's got a dirty bomb or what have you, there's a terrorist attack is being planned, you know, this guy has some information. What is the best way to get it out of them? Is there a best way?

Speaker 3:          01:18:53       Yes. You know what does not really, because it's all dependent on the individual and that's where it's so much of this and it just again, the, the, the argument got sort of corrupted, hijacked, whatever. Because of waterboarding, because it just became such an emotive issue, uh, but it's an enormously labor intensive process. Even in those cases where you think, okay, we've just picked up a high value target and we feel that they've got operational information that we really need to know, uh, related to whatever. Um, it's, it's, it's not as if you don't go in there and start beating them over the head with a two by four and nobody, nobody does that, you know, maybe some, maybe some liaison partners, you know, in, in, in, you know, fourth world countries, you know, would world fifth world. What's the fifth world country? I'd never even heard of that.

Speaker 3:          01:19:43       New Jersey, Connecticut, Connecticut outside of Dan Malloy is the president of the fifth World Nation of Connecticut. Um, so, you know, it's, it's down to the individual is knowing your homework. It's, it's having all the information that you can at your fingertips about, okay, well who is this person where the associates, who else have we picked up and what have they said up to this point? Do you have anything like that that you can walk into there? If you walk into an interrogation and you haven't done your homework, you're screwed, right? It's going to show out really quickly and they're going to figure it out for the most part. You know, not to say that there every detainee would be a lex Luthor, but you know, they get a sense pretty quickly so you really got to have it buttoned up, have as much information as possible so that you know how to direct the conversation. If anything is said at all, volunteered at all, is there any credibility to it? What can you do with that information? You can take it back and get it corroborated by another series

Speaker 4:          01:20:38       is a. it's going to shut that off man series. I'm transcribing everything you said. No, I ain't mad at doing that. Well now what about, what about using like chemicals? Like what about like Mtma have they ever tried given detainees ecstasy? I'm no, I mean I dunno. Sixties, you know, maybe the 19 sixties. I'm sure I would say. And you'd be. You'd be surprised. It's taking a series still listening to me that, that big brother she knew. Well, I don't know what to do this to the government. It's, it's google. I hate to break it to Google, but you can listen right now on youtube to fucking covertly attack people's phones doing that asshole stuff. No, it's. You know what? There's. There are, and again, they might not know enough about ecstasy. I need to get on the team if I just talked to them.

Speaker 4:          01:21:30       Get along. I'm telling you, you give these guys to hits. They'll tell you everything because getting massage, that'll be your code name. It'd be so nice to you. It just changes everything. That's. There'll be so nice to you. They'll just give him like some delicious food and give them a back rub and just go, listen man, America's awesome. Tell me what you know about that plot that we want to know about. Blow anybody up, man. They can't be your friend. How could you do that? If you kill people that can't be your friend. Yeah, I think that would work. I don't know why we didn't think about that, but it seems like it wouldn't work, but you know why you haven't done that. Well, there you go. You've done it. No, that you go, I've done it. Trust me. It'll fucking work. Getting people to heads of ecstasy.

Speaker 4:          01:22:12       Acid, a show. I tell you what I'll do. We'll get. I will get on the jet and we'll go back to headquarters and meeting saying is bullshit. I'm joking around the what that stuff does is first of all, it kills all of your inhibitions are gone. All of your anxiety gone. All in, all of your insecurities gone and what you're left with is this over Saratonin. Over dopa means state. We just love everything. And everybody, if you could give that to enemy combatants, I guarantee you if you could talk to them, you would get shit out of them that they would never want to discuss.

Speaker 3:          01:22:48       Yeah, I think the people will buy it when I say it, but there are tremendous constraints on what can and can't be done. If people had gone through and actually read all those dog

Speaker 4:          01:22:59       memos that were released, me and buddy. There you go. That's what I'm talking about. The chemist coat on some fake glasses. So I look, look smarter than I am. Give me a stethoscope, maybe liking club Gary. Just show up. You take them out for a rave. High water pants, Italian shoes. Now you're talking sort of the seventies hustle. Yeah, just bring me in. I'm telling you. Just let me try it. Once I could fix a lot of shit, I'll put the idea forward. I'll see what they say. And then if you know the reason why they don't think it would work because they haven't done it yet. If you get anybody in the viewer, anybody in the ca or wherever who has done ecstasy, they would listen to this and they would not want to say they've done it. So it'd be a real issue.

Speaker 4:          01:23:42       But if you. I'm telling you, you give people two tabs of ecstasy and then start asking them questions. Plus also it would've been much happier facility. Oh yeah. Can you open the next day? Not the next day. Next Day is rough. He fucking. I remember the first time, well I only did it once, but the next day I did it. I quit. I was in a coffee shop trying to read a boxing magazine. I literally could not read. I was like, God, I can't even concentrate enough to read a full sentence. Like this is terrible. And it was just pretty much that day after. No, it's good to a couple of days. That night I went onstage and I was terrible. I went on stage that night in Dallas. If you went to that show back in 2001 or whatever it was. I'm sorry. If I was apologizing. Terrible show. Well, I just had no energy.

Speaker 4:          01:24:25       My brain was just like. I felt like my brain was a dry sponge. Like someone had just squeezed all the juice out of my brain. Yeah. See it says after effects, I just, you know, you're not worth it now, but there's ways out of that. There's a. just keep on it. No, there's nutrients that you take called five htp. Five htp actually converts. The serotonin in your brain is the building blocks for it, so what you do is while you're tripping, you're supposed to double down on five htp and it helps you as you come off of it, your serotonin jumps back up. Oh, not 100 percent though, but to a manageable state, who would. You do have to be a chemist though to do all that. Right. Just got to be discovered just by a couple of tabs at the club, you know, call it good, but if you're really smart, you actually take l, Tryptophan and five htp because El Tryptophan converts to five htp and you should also take adaptogens, like some b vitamins and different things as well.

Speaker 4:          01:25:18       That sense? What? Is that? What's in Turkey? Yes. Okay. Yeah, but you just have a Turkey club, nice Turkey club. While you're that apparently that's bullshit that crashed that people we say from Turkey that you know, it puts you to sleep. Apparently that's all just carbs. Oh yeah, that makes sense. Yeah. And massive amounts of mashed potatoes, stuffing. You just overeat and I can believe that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Although I do love stuffing. Listen, bring this information back. I'm telling you, you have to bring it back. It's happening right now. It's happening right now. They're hearing us listening to the watch center. They don't know. It's only because they don't know Langley there taking notes right now. You know he. I am right. I'm telling you. I'm right. Just try it once. It doesn't hurt anybody. They're not going to die. You might

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       have to change some laws to to get that to happen. Last fucking nose ain't bring me in. There's no laws. No. I show up with a suitcase and a smile. Get you guys some UFC tickets. We'll buy it. We'll know. We'll get you a lab coat. Get Joe's special disguise. Just let me try it once. I guarantee just someone that some. Someone who's not totally despicable, like you just gotta like a little issue with this guy talking. It just changes your chemistry immediate. Just whittle. It will erase any inhibitions. You. That sounds all very mengele like does, but it doesn't hurt anybody. That's the thing. Yeah. Yeah. I think right now people are losing their minds because we got back on the. The interrogation thing, everybody thinks I thought that was over and done with. Oh, you on your side in the business. Yeah, just people in general.

Speaker 2:          01:26:54       I think everybody's just. People just got so tired of it. Tired of the war on terror. Nobody wants to talk. Oh, not that I want to talk about it, but that's what happens. You think where's the end where you know, and, and people just tired of it. I just want to move on. I don't want to think about it and something happens and people are reminded that it's still going on. There's still people out there that want to hurt you and yet we're all just so exhausted from it. Well, I think that's also. I mean, you could, you could make an analogy to some of the stupid lies that trump has told that tell so many lies that he just like, I can't even be bothered. This can't even be a scandal because there's just, there's so many of them. You just get overwhelmed by it to the point where you can't even.

Speaker 2:          01:27:34       He can't process it anymore. It's exhausting. It's exhausting. And, and the, the idea that it kind of works both ways, right? It works in the sense that the tweets and the bizarre statements and the things are exhausting. And then on the, you know, the other side that people that want to make all of that stuff, the death of the republic every day, it's the death of the republic that's exhausting. And you say who's, who's running the shop, who's keeping things moving forward? And I don't know, you know, I mean, we've got some good people in governments, really hardworking people for sure. Trying to do the right thing. And yet it's just a, I'm not, I'm not particularly confident right now. What do you think's the worst case scenario right now? So when you say you're not confident. Um, well I think we could have, we could see the market, you know, kind of stall at this point.

Speaker 2:          01:28:23       I mean, I think people have been amazed at how the market was resilient and not just resilient, but you know, a blasting upwards and showing apparently no concern for, you know, how disheveled the administration has been over the last several months has been on a steady increase since 2007 or so. No, the crash, right? Yeah. But since that, since the recovery of the long time, it took a long time to come back, but then. Yeah. Right. I mean it's not, it's not, but what I'm talking about is the time since the election, you know, the market's showed this ability to kind of ignore what was happening. Right. What was sort of the chaos that the media is reporting on and encouraged though by his remarks about business. You want to encourage tax cuts. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. And the, and some of the deregulation which has, you know, okay, to be fair, you know, it's been a lot a fair amount of deregulation.

Speaker 2:          01:29:14       Tax cuts not so much. And so I think now that, you know, the market's starting to look at that and think maybe we do have an issue here. Maybe it's not, you know, oh, I'm going to work out the way we thought, so maybe that slows down. I don't think North Korea is going to be watching any missiles. They're not suicidal, right? I mean, they're not going to see. And Kim Jong Gun. What's the fuck's his name? The basketball player with those shit and his lips. Rodman Rodman said Rodman over there with a little Kim Yong. And that's what I'm sad I can do. That. Definitely does ecstasy. So that's that. Now that I could get behind, that's an operation we could, we could work on know because that's not targeting detainees and then have all those regulations we've got to worry about. But I think, you know, if Rodman, you know, willingly offers up ecstasy and Kim says, fine, then it's two consenting adults yet we don't even allow Rodman to go back over there anymore.

Speaker 2:          01:30:07       Right. Was. Yeah. I think that Americans aren't allowed to go back there and now, but now, right now I suspect, although if Robin wanted to, I'm sure he. Yeah. Yeah. That's our answer to everything sent Dennis. He was a hell of a ballplayer in his day. People Forget. People think Pacino. He's such an interesting cat, but people forget what a great basketball player he was. Yeah. He just sort of went crazy. Yeah. Yeah. Look at them. Remember this picture? Oh yeah. Bad as I want to be. Was that a bookie or something? Well, I mean you can't knock the guy for trying to be unique. Yeah, no, he's, he's unique. But he was again, he, he was a hell of a player. Oh, he definitely was mad. A good look. I haven't seen it one for. I got a jacket just like tropical jacket with all the palm trees and what he said he's wearing around his neck.

Speaker 2:          01:30:55       His had a fishing net or is that. It could be anything mad. It's like a silver Mr t thing. See, I could look at that and say I could never pull that off. I could never. I couldn't do that for Christmas. Yeah. Halloween, but not. Not for Christmas. Had Christmas and and besides it Christmas when the season arrives, I put on my, my handmade New York giants, a sweater from my daughter and I don't take it off until after the Christmas season as well. Yeah. Yeah. It's pretty manky by now. But yeah, that's a great way to do that because it's a giant. Oh, oh, sort of giants. One of those guys just cling to it to cling to the past. Glories maybe not in the government anymore. So. No, no. I might those days or even the possibility of those days just. I mean, unless maybe I get older and I just, you know, I want to see kids just slipped out of tab, you know, and see what happens. I told her to calm the fuck down. Yes. Yeah. There's only one way. Not told

Speaker 3:          01:31:59       my kids. Okay. If, if things get bad, if I start to, you know, I got blessed my, my mom's 98 and she's all there. She's great. My Dad passed away when he was 90. He was all there and uh, and so I've got a knock on wood. I'm hoping to make it a good long ways, but I've also seen folks deal with the problem of, you know, onset dementia and Alzheimer's, the problems that, that creates horrible things. I told my kids that I haven't told them, but I told the oldest one is just we'll that out to the back and you know, you guys all take turns shooting abby and whoever, whoever wins gets the house. So is that really what you told them? What? Yeah, the oldest one. I said, shoot you. He'll, he'll win my ways. It's pretty good shot. Yeah. But if then he'll go to jail.

Speaker 3:          01:32:43       You don't want that title. Ho sure. There's some law on the books that says it's okay to, you know. No, that's not true. You're right. Where do they have that? Assisted suicide is in California, California, and I think Oregon. You posted something about Idaho, about people that were going up there for the eclipse and I retweeted it. It was fucking hilarious from the sheriff's department, Lincoln County sheriffs that that guy knocked it out of the park because everybody was thinking the same thing. Everybody was like it because literally the hippies, I don't know, maybe they're not hippie, so I. that's not fair, but let's call them hippies. Yeah. They just, they'd pull their, their camper or their, you know, their, their Volkswagen van again, right out in the middle of a plant. That field of freshly planted field because it's not, not, not everything is fenced and gate it out there.

Speaker 3:          01:33:29       Right. There's a lot of space and you're like, come on. Or they'll, they'll, they'll take. Like I said, they'll take their prius up in the back roads, you know, it's not going to make it. The funny thing was about the dogs to dogs riding the back of the truck and occasionally some slow loaners took a tumble, but don't go to pet them. They will bite you. It's your truck. It's their truck. And you'll see that you'll see people, hey, they get upset because, you know, drive around with your, you know, your, your dog in the back of the truck. And B, they'll, they'll like walk up and why don't I write pettit new thing? Don't do that. Don't do it. You don't even know if he's a good dog, but he, that's his truck. The other thing about people haven't guns. It's yes. Everybody up here has a gun.

Speaker 3:          01:34:09       This is Idaho and the wildlife, the wildlife will kill you. I'll kill you. And it will hurt the whole time you're dying. Yeah. That sheriff, it was great post. We got great law enforcement or not. I just got stopped. I was uh, we were up in the mountains and I was racing to get to the airport on Sunday yesterday. And so I was coming through the canyon, um, and hidden back into boise from up in the mountains and it's doing well. I know what I was doing because the sheriff told me what I was doing. He stopped me. He said even [inaudible] 76 and this is a, this is a nasty ass canyon following the river, you know, for most of the way and you know, you should be doing about 35, 40, but I always just helmet, you know. And I was thinking I'm making good time here.

Speaker 3:          01:34:56       And the sheriff was out because he's trying to catch hippies and he stopped me and we had it, but they're just great. You know, that you, if you show them respect and implied, it's like a lot of places, right? It's not just idle, but the guy was like, you know what, I'm sorry what to gave you to, you know. But yeah. How's everything else? And you end up chatting, having a great time, having a conversation. You don't mind getting the ticket and you know, bob's your uncle. But anyway, we just white privilege of showing. Yeah. That's what's happening right there. Is that what's happening to a bunch of white privilege. Right. Tammy? That, you know what, that's probably, that's probably the case now. I feel bad and I'm, you know what I'm gonna do? I'm going to, I'm going to double what I sent in to the county. I'm going to pay twice the amount that I should. Well that's nice. Just so that I, I, I self flagellate. Yeah. It's not like it's a hobby. Most cops are great. I've always said that.

Speaker 4:          01:35:45       I think that cops will look, most people, most people you run into her fine, most people you run into a great, occasionally you run into an asshole and then you have a problem and then you run around going all people. We're all assholes. No, maybe one out of 100, you know. And I think with cops it's an insanely difficult job. Insanely stressful.

Speaker 3:          01:36:04       And you see that video, that one officer who was trying to get that fellow to stop and he was wearing, he was wearing a body camera and so he had, he had asked him to stop and he matched the description of a, I think of robbery and um, it's been on, it's been on video of quite a bit. And so the, the officer is trying to get him to stop trying to him to stop. He won't stop. He says I will tase you. And he's coming around. Right? So He's, the guy won't be take his hand out of his pocket. And that's what the officer sees that his hands in his pocket when he gets kind of starts, you know, pie in that chart. There are any kind of gets around and he sees the hand and he starts saying, take your hand out, take your hand and take in its body cameras running, and the guy pulls out a weapon and shoot him repeatedly and it's just, it's all there on kids. It's, it's a, it's a perfect example of how difficult that job can be. Right. And it's, it's astounding. So I know whether that video is available.

Speaker 4:          01:36:58       Yeah, it is available. I've seen it. Yeah, there's, there's a bunch of those. I mean, I've seen one of them where a guy pulls over this one man and uh, the guy was a Vietnam vet, gets out of his car, he's got a rifle, was yelling at him, get back to the car, put the rifle down, put the gun down, and the guy starts shooting them and he's shooting multiple rounds into the guy's car. And the guy started screaming. Then he goes around by the passenger's side and kills them. It's all like on camera and video, you have to realize this is a routine traffic stop, pulls them over for speeding or whatever it was. And this happens. And it can happen all the time and that's something that's on a cop's mind every time he pulls somebody over and you might think, hey, I'm a good person, I'm not doing anything. So I was going five miles an hour over the speed limit, you know, why is this guy got his hand on his gun? Why this guy freaking out? Well maybe watch that video now. Maybe he's thinking about his kids, maybe he's thinking about getting home to his family. Right,

Speaker 3:          01:37:46       exactly. And that's. And there's nothing to. And again, this idea that you can't say two things that some people might think, oh, that, that counteracts. Yeah, anytime there's a, you know, a case of police brutality, deal with it, we got to deal with hard course, but it's a terrible job. It's a difficult job and it's a dangerous job. And those, those two statements can coexist. Right? And there's so you can support the police and you can also support efforts to stop police brutality wherever it takes place and ensure that it doesn't. But you can also support the police and the difficult job they do and the efforts that they try to make them, you know, protect communities. So

Speaker 4:          01:38:25       yeah, the last thing you want to do is alienate them further. Mean that doesn't do anybody any good. You denine the idea or the possibility there are any good cops. Well that's fucking crazy, but it's a really convenient thing for people to say fuck the police because you don't get a lot of pushback. Especially when something happens. You don't get a lot of pushback. You look like, you know, you're some sort of a liberal hero. It's a very slippery slope. And the people that want no cops. Well, okay, well what about guns? What are we going to do now? You're going to just let criminals run everything. Yeah, no, no. The good people with their flowers are going to take over

Speaker 3:          01:38:57       shit. Shit breaks down really quickly, real quick and you know, spend a long time overseas and some pretty difficult environments and you see sort of the worst nature of people or you know, and, and you know, and again, I agree with it. I think vast majority of people are good, you know, they want to do good. They want to do the right thing, don't want conflict. Most people don't want conflict, right? And, and, but, but things can break down and people can do things that other folks that are trying to do the right thing couldn't even imagine. And uh, yeah. So anyway,

Speaker 4:          01:39:29       like shoot cops. Yeah. Yeah. I mean you have to think I would never shoot a cop wise's copy and so mean to me because he doesn't fucking know you. Right, right. You know, it doesn't know you. You're doing something wrong, he's pulling you over and you've got to comply and be polite and calm sir. And try to diffuse the situation and be as friendly and as polite as possible. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:39:47       And that's not. And again, that's, that's the same. You can give your kid, no matter who you are, you can give your kid that same advice. Look, the law enforcement has a difficult job and you know, so just, if you're stopped, just comply, comply. Nobody's ever. I mean, I, you just gotta you gotta be concise and smart about that. And I tell my kids out and I try to demonstrate by like when I stopped you and the sheriff came up and you know, my kids were in the car and I, I, I was polite and I was saying, and he got to the window and I said, I don't have any excuse. I was racing to get to the airport. I was speeding. I know it and I have no excuse. And that sets the tone immediately. And he understands right now it helps it. He looks in there and he sees a big dog and the kids and everything and that brings it down a little bit. There's no doubt about it. Um, and so other situations they might be more on edge because they don't know. They're not sure. And you know, so yes. Where there's problems, deal with it. We got to take care of it, but we can also acknowledge the fact that the police have a damn difficult job. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:40:51       and it doesn't mean that there horrible mistakes

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       and horrible cops and people that are under pressure to do terrible things. You know, mean there's some videos of people that compliance still get shot. It's, yeah. It's a terrible tragedy. No, absolutely. They make mistakes. They make mistakes or they had the wrong mindset or they're not trained properly and so their ptsd out and they're just not designed for that job in the first place. Right. I mean, it's very difficult to tell who's going to crack under pressure. The pressure of the day to day situation that a lot of cops find themselves in. Yeah. No, it's, it's, um, but the idea that you're right, the idea that you'd remove law enforcement and somehow we're all going to live in a peaceful community. Crazy anarchists driving me fucking nuts. Yeah. We don't need laws, man. Shut your fucking mouth and get rid of all the laws and universal basic income.

Speaker 2:          01:41:37       That's going to be a, what did we do out the guns? We've gathered them up and melt them down, not mine, Make Martin Luther King Jr statues everywhere. And we know we were talking before the podcast started about, um, what's, uh, what could possibly go wrong in Afghanistan and that trump was trump was going to make some sort of an announcement and you were talking about the idea of privatizing the, uh, the military over there and, you know, bringing in contractors, talking about it from the point of view that I don't agree with it. I. Yeah. Um, and I, you know, I, you know, in terms of disclosure, right, I mean, my company intelligence, we've got a security services group, um, and starting back in 2003, we started building up a fairly significant presence out in Iraq, right as, as private contractors providing support to the infrastructure operations that were going on out there.

Speaker 2:          01:42:32       And what's the benefit of having a private contractor for the military as opposed to like military force at that time. Most of our work was actually for the infrastructure companies, right? Because the military is not providing the support and they need the same level of security and they have the burden is building up some sort of a new business there. They would hire you guys to come in and. Exactly. And so that's an important effort because you know, they need the same level of security that a forward operating base or a military base or facility would need, you know, but the military is not going to allocate resources for a private company. So a lot of what the private contractors were doing was that. And then also private contractors, you know, getting contracts to provide additional security support or logistical support to uh, the military to military facilities where they can't, you know, they, they can't afford to allocate resources to perimeter security and to the degree that they would like.

Speaker 2:          01:43:21       So private contractors come in and help with that or providing support in the movement of dignitaries or whatever may be a point being is we're out there for, for quite some time in Iraq doing that. And we were there at the beginning of sort of this private contractor thing. Right? And people start becoming aware of it and we started working with groups including a Erik prince is a group we didn't work directly with them, but what I mean is the various groups that are out there doing these contracts and this work, you know, realizing that you needed to start to form an association or started to get some

Speaker 3:          01:43:52       sort of grip on how this thing would look. Right. So that there was some consistency amongst training and what were the regulations for, you know, uh, the various companies for, you know, weapons and everything else. It's complicated, but you know, long story short is, you know, we had upwards of 400 people I guess out there at a, at a point providing security and intelligence support. So I've got some experience in this and now what's happening with Afghanistan is that one of the options that's been being considered is, is handing over. We've got about an 8,400 troops out there right now doing mostly training missions, training operations and support for the Afghan troops. So the idea was, well, let's let the private contractor take that over. Let's, let's move that out. And let's not have the brave men and women of the US military engaged in Afghanistan ad Nauseum, you know, and this idea is being pushed to some degree by Erik Prince, you know, and he's said things like, well, you know, if, you know, if you want to keep having this conversation, you want to have the conversation 10 years from now, Friday the military keep doing it, you know, or we can be more, you know, somehow efficient.

Speaker 3:          01:44:58       And they explained that people who Eric Princes from Blackwater, blackwater and yeah, he came out of a, of a, a wealthy Michigan based family. Betsy devoss the cat or the education secretary is a sister in the current administration. And so he started water and you know, they uh, they, they became sort of the face of right because they, they, they did very well. It's a private contractor business. They got good contracts and that was good. They had some issues and some problems. A very controversial, very controversial. They sold the business, renamed it, then renamed it again, and Yada, Yada Yada. But the point being is that the idea that somehow you're going to prioritize this operation in Afghanistan expecting then I guess here's the thing, he, because he said, well, it'd be about $10,000,000,000 a year, which would be a savings on what we spend now. You give private contractors, uh, you know, a $10,000,000,000 trough to eat at.

Speaker 3:          01:45:46       You think they're going to end it anytime soon, there's no fucking way. So if we want this thing to just drag on ad Nauseum, fine, privatized it and put that profit motive up there and you think somehow it's not going to happen. And I can ever to say that as a private contractor in that had been involved in it. Well, I appreciate your honesty. Not I just, it's just, it's the wrong thing to do. And if not top of that, if I guess the, the, the overlying, the 30,000 foot view that I've got is that if it's important enough for us to be there, then that's a military function. That's, that's. Then we have to commit in a way that, you know, we're not right now, we've been in this sort of stalemate situation right over there and now we're somewhat surprised. Are people are surprised at the Taliban is resurgent, well, where the hell did they think they were going to go?

Speaker 3:          01:46:36       There's Taliban don't have any place to go there. So they're gonna wait us out. This was entirely predictable that some and what we're trying to sell them this pseudo federal democracy, you know? Then the Afghan people don't understand for the most part, I don't think, maybe I'm just too cynical, but they don't understand what the hell we've been trying to sell them for all these years. So this doesn't diminish all the pain and sacrifice and suffering of all people that have been out there and the lives that we've lost. It doesn't diminish it at all. What I'm saying is that we need to think about what's our, what's our end game, what's our objective? So if we're worried now about the Taliban resurging and Isis, you know, kind of coming back in, well fine, but let's, let's say this is our objective and to meet that objective, then we're going to need more troops on the ground and let's see how that plays out.

Speaker 3:          01:47:21       I don't think a lot of people are going to be happy about it. You don't necessarily do things to make people happy. If it's a national security interests. If we decide that that's in our national security interest, then yes, we need to commit and do it. But handing it over to a privatized, you know, force to me is, is uh, is, is just slightly left of insane. It doesn't make any sense. And you know, it's always easy for people to stand around and talk tough and say we just need more troops. You know? Well, I don't know that the objective is sufficiently clarified to say that we need more troops. I haven't heard. I don't care whether we improve the literacy rate of the Afghan people by another percentage point of if we build another road. I don't think that's in our national security interests and so I think we need to be a little bit more clear about why we're there, what we're hoping to accomplish.

Speaker 3:          01:48:07       At some point we wanted to be there so that we wouldn't use it as a playground for terrorists to then develop and plot and plan and attack the West again, so maybe the thing that will, what we should have done was go in there, kick the shit out of them that like we did in Tora Bora and elsewhere, explained to the remnants of the government. If you allow that to happen again, we're going to come back and we'll do this again and we're very good at that. We're very good at strategic operations and we could have done that and maybe that's the thing we need to do now. And then that government's been corrupt for a very long time. The Karzai government, Holy Shit. They were completely corrupt and yet we all rallied around cars. I as if he was because he dressed well. One of his brother was a heroin.

Speaker 3:          01:48:45       Yes. Yeah. It's awful. And you know, in the current government is, is it any better? Well, they're a little more clever at hiding their corruption, but it's still exists. And more importantly, the tribal society there, it doesn't really get this idea of, you know, a strong central government, you know, it kind of runs counter to thousands of years of, of self governance out there. But anyway, so that's, that's the thing. So what, what's he gonna say tonight? I don't have a clue, but I think he's, he does. He's got limited opera job. What's it going to take? We're going to cut and run. We're going to leave. That's one option. We're going to increase the number of US troops on the ground. That's one option is right there. It's a trump, 4,000

Speaker 4:          01:49:22       more troops to Afghanistan. Is that, is that good? Now here's the thing about when it comes to operations over there and what are, what the objectives are. One of the things that I've been hearing from people that are in the military that I know is they say they are happy that trump is supporting them and that trump has kind of essentially giving the reigns, the military saying, look, this is what you guys do. I'm not going to get in your way. In fact I'm going to support you, and there seemed to one of the few groups

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       that is fairly universally happy with his decisions in that regard and with the people that he's appointed. I think that's right. I think law enforcement as well, I think is it? Yeah. If you feel like you've got top cover, you know, then you know, that was one of the problems. I mean people talked about the art and we talked about it briefly about the idea of the sort of the narrative of sort of a battle between trump and the intel community where the community had a problem with the previous administration because they kept shifting the goal posts. They were going to criminally prosecute people in the agency for engaging in that interrogation program and rendition program that had been approved by the previous administration that you know, that creates some ill will, so the fact that you know, the military and, and to some degree, you know, others and certainly law enforcement of feel as if they've got this top cover from the current administration.

Speaker 3:          01:50:34       That is a good thing. And if you're, if you're willing to not politicize all of this and, and, and make every decision related to national security based on how you think it's gonna move the polls, then that's also a good thing. As long as you're getting good solid advice and you're consistent in your decision making process, all those things are good. Um, I don't know enough about trump to know how, you know, he makes those decisions, but he does have good of Madison's good pump peo is a good person. John Kelly, certainly. Great Guy. Mcmaster, all these people are solid people who in any other administration would, you know, people would be saying, yeah, that's great. You know, they're very highly regarded, but it's sort of, there's this cloud over because it's trump and people are still not sure how things play out in that administration, but if he does listen, I think yeah, that's a good thing.

Speaker 3:          01:51:25       But sending 4,000 more troops, that's not quite 50 percent on top of what we've currently got there. Um, what does that allow us to do? Well, some of those troops are going to have to be involved in security operations of the trainers. Some of those troops are going to have to be involved in, you know, logistical support, Intel collection support. So, you know, will it make us more effective in defeating and the short term some of the pushback from the Taliban and identifying and taking out more isis will. Sure. Okay. And then, and then what? I guess that's my question. What, what, what are we doing? What is our objective in Afghanistan today in 2017? What is the objective? I couldn't eloquently, not that I could add eloquently do shit, but I couldn't. I couldn't state what our end game is there. I think it's, I would suppose in a big picture, it's to create a stable society that will be a bulwark of some form of democracy. Have we ever done that thought? I mean, we ever had successfully been involved in nation building. We have, what did you think about, um, post World War II, but that was again at different times. I mean, so you can't compare it necessarily, you know, chronologically I, so when we've invaded places or when we've been a part of like, look what's going on in Libya, I mean

Speaker 2:          01:52:46       we, we supported that revolution and now it's a fucking complete disaster and a terrifying part of the world. Yeah. It's a real hot mess and nobody wants to talk about Libya and we didn't have a national security interest in Libya and yet we allow ourselves to get in there. Why did we do that? A lot of pressure from the French and the Italians who did, and I think we felt it was somehow. I don't know why, but maybe there was a feeling as if it would be easier, more containable somehow. But I mean, shit, there's more tribal history. More tribes in Libya than in Afghanistan. It's, you know, you had to get like 130 some odd tribes in Olympia. So another thing that I watched recently as a, as a country, so watch Qaddafi's death again recently and watched the whole capture of him and the whole thing.

Speaker 2:          01:53:37       It was just fascinating to watch his brutal evil murderer is dictator. All the sudden get caught by these common people. These rebels, you know, like, you know, outside of his palace and freaking out. And yeah, players all fucked up. And the weird thing is he was, he was our guy, he was a dictator. Renounced. He had gotten on board for the most part on sort of a counterterrorism program to provide assistance or support or at least not impede A. I'm not saying it was, yeah, it was a, it was a complete son of a bitch. But it's interesting isn't it? The dynamics involved. And so we decided that it was better to support the French and Italians and topple him. And now you know, it's, I mean, but that's always the case. You know, isn't always the case too that we have these dictators we problem up and then after a while, Jesus, this fucking guy, we've got to get them out of there.

Speaker 2:          01:54:30       Like so dumb. Yeah. Sort of same and Hussein lasted a long time in that position. When you think about the horrific nature of some of the shit that he did and his sons did. Oh yeah. Sons were completely monsters. Yeah. And that's a good point. I mean, you know, and, but you know, hey, how did it, how did his presence when they were at odds with Iran, you know, how did that help our overall sense of strategic foreign policy? So things happen and you don't, you know, it's, you don't get to pick and choose sometimes I guess maybe you do, but then it'd be, it'd be a kind of a strange world, but you got to deal with sometimes with the people that are out there and, and you know, um, so it's, I, I don't know, 4,000 more troops in Afghanistan. I, is that going to somehow solve a problem? It's going to, I suspect, kick the can down the road. Again. It's like Vietnam. What would you do? Where did the vehicle have to go? They had nowhere to go. It's a totally different situation though, isn't it? Because the Viet Cong really didn't have any threat to us. Well, what I mean is, is what did we think was gonna Happen? They were going to outweighed us. They were going to have glasses. They were going to say the suffering was nothing in their minds compared to what we were going through and how we were processing.

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       And so I guess that's what I mean. You can't. Yeah, everything is, is, is, uh, is relative, but I mean with this, um, what would you do? Well, I have, you were in the situation to call the shots. If someone said, hey, Mike Baker, what do we do about Afghanistan? Yeah. And you know what, I'm, it's, it's, it's, it, it. I'm not saying it's an easy by any means. It's a, it's above my pay grade, but b, I think I'm. Isis creates a different situation there. If we hadn't seen isis develop and start to impact to some degree things that are going on in Afghanistan, then I think we could be better off just saying, okay, we're gonna. Figure out a way to work with the Taliban. I mean the Taliban, I think at this stage of the game could be contained within Afghanistan without allowing their place to be used as a shelter for terrorism.

Speaker 3:          01:56:36       I say that now caveating saying now you've got isis and that's a different kettle of fish because they're at odds with each other. So what are we going to do? I ended up, you know, in some weird fashion supporting the Taliban and their efforts to, you know, stamp out isis. I don't know. It's a, it's a, it's real weird. Yeah. This is what we're talking. Thousands of years of history of failed efforts in Afghanistan. And do I think, do I have the Hubris to think that we somehow are going to solve this? No. So, you know, maybe maybe the answer is just find that point on the curve where you can support an existing government that you can hold your nose and live with. It's, you know, that it's corrupt and you know, but at least they're working in the counter terrorism realm, you know, and they're there supporting those sort of interests from our perspective.

Speaker 3:          01:57:26       And yet, you know, I don't think we're ever going to get to that point where we see a stable self supporting, you know, pseudo democratic nation exist there. I just don't think it's going to happen. So that's a hugely unsatisfying answer. But you know, maybe it's, maybe it's like pollution. You do little things, you know and hope that it helps. And maybe that's what we're doing here. You know, if you just start from the point of view of saying we're going to create a bulwark of democracy, you overwhelmed, it's never going to happen. So you don't do anything. You know, background. I, part of me just, I hate the idea of leaving, right? I mean, I think a lot of people do who are living, we're going to create a vacuum, right? Right. And, and quite frankly, that's typically what happens, you know, and particularly with isis president said they would see that and they would see an opportunity.

Speaker 3:          01:58:11       Now, you know, they, they're, they're at odds with the Taliban and the Taliban is pretty brutal. Um, could they handle it on their own, you know, meaning, could they destroy isis on their own? Who knows? Maybe, but it's a, it certainly complicates the situation. But now, especially if we just decide to switch somehow or another support isis now, that's never going to happen. Whenever. No, I mean, excuse me, the Taliban, their battle against Isis could see that. I could see elements of the Taliban saying, look, we just want to self govern. Right? Okay, we get it. But you're not going to

Speaker 4:          01:58:45       imagine a scenario where the United States would support the Taliban because they were at war with Isis. Taliban could soften their stance on some things. We reached some sort of common ground.

Speaker 3:          01:58:54       Well look, we're kind of on the same side with Iran against Isis right? And we're not supporting Iran in a way. We are in a sense that we're, we're trying to kill the same people. Right? So who would have thought that, you know, four or five years ago. So that's how nutty Isis says. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Everybody can agree. Everybody get a great. That's the one group that everybody can agree on. Um, but yeah, I don't know. It's interesting. So that's what the president's going to talk about this evening. 4,000 more troops. I, you know, he could have said we're gonna leave and the people that hate trump would be up in arms. You could say we're going to add 40,000 troops are going to be up in arms. You could say we're going to give it over to the private contractors. They'd be up in arms. It doesn't really matter. So there's going to be a lot of opposition to this regardless. Um, if there's a clear defined mission with an end game, fine. I just haven't heard. I don't know what that is. And maybe they, maybe they've said it and I just haven't seen it.

Speaker 4:          01:59:50       Well, it seems like the only way we're ever going to get peace and harmony in the world is if there's no fifth world, fourth world, third world or second world. Just one first world. Everybody has like suburban problems.

Speaker 3:          02:00:02       Yeah. Yeah. Is that even possible? No. I mean, I never society where everybody's on the same footing. Impossible. A universal basic income and a cross the world and get rid of law enforcement. Doing exactly. No everywhere. I don't think that's it. Yeah, it's not gonna happen and I,

Speaker 4:          02:00:22       that's so disheartening for people though to a guy like you as so many years of experience in intelligence agencies that you would say that there's nothing that could ever be done that would give peace in the world. Like generations from now, we're still going to be dealing with the same issues.

Speaker 3:          02:00:41       Maybe if the chemist can figure out a way to get us all so next to see mean that's going to solve it. Yeah. No, I don't know. You know, it's, it's, it's the way it is. It's human nature. And um, I, you know, we have, we go through periods of pace, you can go through periods of prosperity and during those periods it kind of helps to lift everybody up and they get to a certain level that they didn't imagine before. There's still trailing. But are we ever going to get to a point where we're all, you know, we're all the same. I don't, I, I mean I hate great, but I don't see it. Here's the perfect xenical

Speaker 4:          02:01:13       the United States in Germany, right? We were at war in the 19 forties and now we're absolutely a piece. I mean this in Germany is prosperous and it's a great country and everything's great. I mean, I would wonder what would have to take place for this to be a worldwide thing where the rest of the world sort of rises up to an adequate level of civilization and we no longer engage and the potential global war

Speaker 2:          02:01:40       that we're all looking at right now. And we're really looking at the possibility with Russia and with North Korea and all these different players. There could be some sort of a twisted world war three going on. Russia is, Russia is punching over its weight. I mean at the end of the day, Russia's got to GDP, you know, equivalent to a midsize EU country. Right. I mean, so they just, you know, at Putin is very clear. He wants to rebuild the Soviet Union to some degree in some fashion. Right. And he's been, he's done it through some territory. It doesn't do energy policy through meddling like they always do, but. So, you know, I don't think Russia, but to your point, yeah, as with the US Germany, could we see a, a way that the US and Iran for example, could find common ground and suddenly 40 years from now be at peace and not only a piece but supporting each other's economy and you know, have that sort of interaction.

Speaker 2:          02:02:29       And I dunno, I don't think so. Thanks. So damn. Can I pour some coffee and I'm good. I'm just thinking. I'm just like, just at a certain point in time, it just, it's very frustrating to think that. I guess the pace of progress is so incredibly slow. When you look back in history, this is probably the safest time to be alive ever. So there's been some progress from Roman times to today. There's obviously been some worldwide progress. Oh, sure. Yeah, yeah. Longevity and stamping out disease and all the rest of those things. Where is like, you know, for what it's worth, it's a great time to be alive and people that are walking around everyday trying to find a reason to be offended or finding that it is because there's no real conflict that they have these issues that the words aren't coming over the border to know, to, uh, to rape and pillage, you know, Great Depression.

Speaker 2:          02:03:22       There's food will display easy to find. They did find the plague that did found the P bionic plague on some ticks, right? Yep. Where was that? Was that in Arizona? I figured it was God Damn Arizona. It's a response to Joe, our pio, getting arrested. Everybody's mad. I wonder if that's what it wasn't there. Some talk about trump pardoning him. Yeah. What does he get? His bubonic plague and Arizona Fleas found carrying the infectious disease. There you go. Wonderful Guy. You know, and that's where it's going to be. It's not going to be. This is my, for what it's worth. I put this along with my big pussy theory, but it's not going to be the North Koreans, you know, firing off a missile or whatever it's gonna be this idea. It's gonna be a pandemic. Something that we didn't quite see coming mutation of a, of a disease or something that because I do believe in the idea that nature takes care of its own eventually, you know, just like a deer herd or whatever.

Speaker 2:          02:04:12       And eventually the overpopulation issue becomes a concern and that's how the earth tends to reset itself. You know, that is always how it works. Yeah. That would suck. But another reason to be in Idaho, bubonic plague and they have three human cases in New Mexico that article said, and then they found it in fleas in Arizona. Yeah. Well everybody goes to your doctor. Well survive the winter. So Idaho, what else has been going on? What else? You tell me the inside track. Yeah, well there is that a man with a suit coat on. I know I get that and what? What I have in here also as a pocket square, I can pull it up. I pulled that out when I do a TV interview, I pulled up a pocket square and just to get a little classier way how people tend to think you know what you're talking about when you have a Hanky.

Speaker 2:          02:05:01       I've learned that from a Guy Ritchie explained the pocket square to me. Yeah, he schooled me in it, so it's not something that I was working on and developing. This is his theory, his theory, but he is a very well educated and very well thought out in regards to his choice of suits and a man wearing a well tailored suit. Tim, is he still married to Madonna? We got rid of the check a long time ago. I remember, but he had a kid with her. Oh, there you go. Yeah. I remember Madonna as soon as she started seeing Guy Richie. I was living in England at the time and she just suddenly out of nowhere had a British accent. I love it, love it. People do. That's fantastic. I love that. I love when white people talk like black people. I love. Um, it's my favorite or a Chinese guy talking like black guy that's even better.

Speaker 2:          02:05:52       Chinese guy now. I what? Have you heard that? I've seen it. I've seen it many times. I'm a big fan of a trans racial, like people that think they're the wrong race. Yes. That's a new thing. It's one of the few trans things you can mock still. Can you mock it? Yes. Okay. Letting it go. He said. Well that'd be, that would be Rachel Dolezal, the Naacp in spokane. That's right. And the identified with Shaun King. Yeah, he's another one, but he denies it. He says that, uh, it's actually, it's all that everyone is wrong. His Mom, his dad, his birth certificate people, he knows, they all lied to them. Uh, they're line everybody else and only he knows. Oh well it says his mom had an affair with a light skin black man or something. Somebody who knows. Exactly. Exactly. It's just I can't, I can't find enough energy given everything else that's going to be offended by very much frankly.

Speaker 2:          02:06:53       I just don't get. I like people to live their own lives. If you are happy, God bless you. Just be happy. I'm way more amused that I am ever offended by things like that. I'm amused. That's a good way to put it. Yeah, that's a good way. That's a good way to say it. You're more amusing than offended. I just. Do you know Rachel Dolezal the trick from spokane because she, uh, got in trouble, you know, because everyone's mad at her. She changed her name legally to the blackest name the world has ever known with young Jamie. Pull it up. Pull that name up. W. This is a, it's a wonderful name and I would encourage anyone that wants to be transformational to do the game. The same thing. AndK , e, c h I a. I don't know how you say that. The catchy a marree.

Speaker 2:          02:07:41       Dr. Lo, that's her new name. Ready? Here we go again. Nick catchy a marree. D'Angelo d I a l l O hm. I liked the description that they give her. She's a former civil rights activist. Enough. Oh, well, I guess because she was fired, but former Afrikanas studies instructor. What's Afrikaana? She decided to give up the civil rights activist thing. Hm. Yeah. Silly goose. But it was great when she had like a fro, like look at her over there with that. Yeah. Full white family orange. Spray Tan from Lincoln County, Montana. Little Ruth Ann's girl. But she feels like she identifies with black people more. She likes the culture more and you know, there's always been people that like the culture more and talk less. Sure that they're a part of the culture. You don't, you don't say you are. Yeah. That's the new thing though, isn't that a love of creating and aren't.

Speaker 2:          02:08:37       They aren't the people that are offended by the idea of appropriating. Like if I opened a Mexican restaurant, people would be offended because I shouldn't do that. I should just, uh, you know, and I know you do. I know black people that were furious at her and I know other people that are also black that were laughing hysterically at it. They thought it was what it was. I think it really doesn't affect you. It's preposterous and not only that, don't be infuriated by the fact that she got caught. I mean she's, I mean this is not like having any undue influence. This is all ridiculous. No, exactly. And that. And also again, it's this idea that people are walking around looking for reasons to be offended. Yeah. And it just seems exhausting. It's like everything. And so I don't, I don't know how people do it.

Speaker 2:          02:09:18       I don't know why they do it. Maybe they just don't have enough going on in their lives, have enough objectivity and they get caught up in the momentum of being pissed off about something, but the cultural appropriation or pretending you're something like, look at how many fucking people pretend they're native American because it makes them seem more spiritual. Jesus, that's always been an issue. Yeah. Yeah, there is. Elizabeth, why was just trying to remember her name? Is she gonna I wonder if she's going to run in 20, 20. It's going to be a problem. Yeah. The allied and said you were part native American to get some sort of scholarship. That's right. Harvard, wasn't it? Oh, look at that. Yeah. I will say this. The world is so funny. After a, when, when, uh, when we went into Iraq in 2003, early 2003, um, people started looking at the business opportunities that rock.

Speaker 2:          02:10:08       Right. And I remember there was that whole idea, excuse me, that there was gonna be all sorts of business opening up in Iraq because I don't know why they were thinking. But um, so then it became people looking for contracts, government contracts, commercial sector contracts to do business in Iraq. And so the idea was suddenly there was a mad rush to open up a minority owned and veteran owned and women owned businesses. So the idea was if you had a, like an annual Indian, you know, Eskimo who was supposedly in charge of your business that gave you extra points when you were weighed in the bid for a contract that you were going for. So there became this cottage industry, you know, much like the casino business of trying to find tribes that you can represent in order for them to end to open up a and you're creating essentially a tribe to have a casino.

Speaker 2:          02:11:04       It gives them a certain advantages which. So it's, it's an interesting, it's an interesting world we live in. Well the native American casino business is very weird in that regard and also that a lot of people in these areas, because there are certain percentage and I think it's as little as one slash 16th native American, you can get a check. So like if, if the casinos raking in the cash, the people that are a part of that tribe all get free money. Yeah. So these casinos are just generating like fucking billions of dollars a year that just because someone, some of them require, some of them are cow, you know, marginal. But, but uh, you know, there are a number of them that do, do very well. And you know, wasn't for some of these. I don't know about you, but some of the. I tell you what, I want to be depressed, go to, you know, there's certain Indian reservations in this country that are just awful.

Speaker 2:          02:11:51       Oh my God, I love her. Poverty is just alcoholism down and, and. Yeah, exactly. Substance Abuse and lack of opportunity, lack of educational facilities for the kids and that's just not, that's not right. We should do. We should be far better than that. There should not be a native American foundations are very strange when you think about like how long ago it was, these tribes, people were roaming the earth and nomadic fashion and living the life they did before the Europeans came and that now they've become this segmented part of our population that's sort of a part of America but has their own kind of like nation inside of a nation. And it was weird rules like the way they have it up in Canada, they call them first nation people, but in candidates real weird in regards to wildlife, like I don't know if you know how it works up there, but they can shoot anything they want all year round and they have it that way in Washington state as well with elk hunt elk all year round.

Speaker 2:          02:12:53       The rules are so different things the same way. They use spotlights for Moose. So like they drive at night with four by fours. The Moose see the spotlight, they freeze, they belong away with high powered rifles and they can kill him as many as they want all year round the same. If we used to go spotlighting kangaroos. I lived in Australia when I was younger, were stationed in England, Australia. I've lived in a lot of places, but I'm now in my. I'm in my last place now. Idaho. I'm not, I've never moved. But um, yeah we used to go in Australia, worked on, lived on a sheep station out there, massive property and we get into the, of the truck with the spotlights. And you go out and those kangaroos are hard as shit to hit. They are tough. Haunting. No. You guys doing that for population control?

Speaker 2:          02:13:40       Many of them, yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. I mean this would be delicious. You know, it can be, you know, depending on how old they are and which high. But um, the uh, the tail is actually the tastiest part. Why Kangaroo tail? Yeah. Yeah. I don't know about all that, but no, I don't mean the ass. I mean the tail tail because it balances. So I've seen the idea you go in real life. Yeah. So, but anyway, they are hard to hit. They are completely unpredictable in their movement and they just uh, and they move fast and they, uh, they jump the fences, they can clear. It's impressive. I know why I'm talking about, we played a video inviting these massive herds or packs or whatever you call them, of kangaroos roaming across the field. Like some people have no idea what the numbers are. You know, I have friends that live in Australia and they tell me like there's places that are just infested and there's nothing they can do. They don't know what to do. So they, they literally have to gun them down because there's no predators. It is. Yeah, that's exactly right. I mean when he got dingoes not going to bring down a, you know, a, a kangaroo, good luck. Feral cat and you know, I mean, but it's. Yeah. So this, they just, they're all over the place. I'm great little animal. So yeah, they're kind of cute and they're tasty. Know, look at these fuckers go bouncing all over the place.

Speaker 2:          02:14:58       A kangaroo call starts that Jesus Christ. So many of them. And Oh, people were upset. I guess people were upset at the kangaroo call was going to have that. Well, uh, Ellen got stuck in a fence. That's not good. Yeah. I mean whenever you have an animal that doesn't have any sort of a natural predator and they can just free free ball it. Exactly, yeah. That's what they, they and Australia is such an interesting place. You know, every time they introduce a species to try to solve a problem that's pcs takes off. Yeah. Yeah. It just, and it's, it's never ending. I was trying to explain to someone the other day about the cats there. Yeah. That they, they hunt cats like, like what we think of as a pet. And they were like, why? And I'm like, listen, I know it doesn't seem right, but the feral cat population is just run out of control.

Speaker 2:          02:15:48       Like we did a podcast once we pulled up the feral cat population in America and what it does that they killed billions of birds and rodents in America. Yeah. And someone was like, no, that can't be right. I'm like, listen, they, the scientists who did the study of shocked cats are fucking murderers. Yeah. And we had a cat, a great cat named Charlie who's now died. Um, but he was a, he was not to a captain most part, but he would, uh, he would kill chipmunks and he would lay the chipmunks out in a row to get offering. Yeah. Yeah. And he was incredibly efficient. We try to keep them indoors. But you know, the guy, he just wanted to be outside killing something, so just fun time and then come in and you open up a nice fresh can of cat food for them.

Speaker 2:          02:16:32       Like thanks dad. He's got a little bit of chip monck in his tooth. Uh, yeah. But the feral cats. Yeah. In, uh, in the, in the ranch. I mean, you'd be out repairing fences or something and yeah, you just kinda get off or they'd spook the horses or you'd get to put your hand down to Pixar and Bob, they just come out of nowhere and they're just, they're bastards. Yeah. They're not kitty, kitty cats. Hello Kitty. Yeah, they're like a wild small Predator that's extremely vicious. And you know, they killed things all the time though. The feral cat problem in the United States is insignificant in comparison to what it does in Australia though. Australia, they have devastated ground nesting birds and all sorts of other species because they're an invasive species and there's nothing. Again, there's nothing really good dingoes maybe, but you know, that's that then I can't get a deputation is now.

Speaker 2:          02:17:20       So it didn't go it. My baby, where you live is fascinating because you've got, you've got everything up there, you got grizzly bears. Yeah. You gotTa, you gotta get a healthy grizzly population. I have a buddy who went black bear hunting up there and they could not find black bears. They found board grizzlies. Yeah. They start grizzly after grizzly after grizzly. It's amazing. I mean, it is, and it is, it's such a good thing. And when you see the sort of the health of the, of the wildlife population and just, it makes you feel really good, you know, and it's, you know, it's hard to explain. I mean, people. I was up in yellowstone and, and uh, once again, I'm always amazed at how people interact with wildlife when they're not used to it. Right? And Yellowstone is probably the best place to see that happen because there's so many tourists during the busy time of year and they'll just say there's no regard for the fact that it's a wild animal.

Speaker 2:          02:18:13       Right? And even the Bison and the price will kill you in a hot second if they get pissed off and you'll get these tourists, it'll get out of that car and you know, and, and, uh, the husband will be taking a picture and telling his wife to get a little bit closer, get closer right now. Maybe he's doing it deliberately, right? But, uh, but it's, it's an amazing thing. Hey, she looks fine and, uh, but it is, it's an amazing. That's another place for people if they, if they haven't been to yellowstone, go to yellowstone. What seems like a zoo to people, you know, you see these gigantic, furry star wars looking things out there. I mean, that's what a buffalo it looks like when you see it real life. Is that real? Yeah. So they're so big. They are, they have massive. And then we were in, we were there and at one point was, it was getting to be twilight and um, came around a corner and I was with a couple of the rangers and, and uh, there was a vehicle stopped. It was a, what do they call it? A minivan. And it was stopped on the side of the road and there were half a dozen people out of this minivan and they work all kinds of fussing about, you know, and it just a little bit in the field they're on the side and think what are they doing? And then it became clear that there was little calf out there. Oh, little

Speaker 3:          02:19:28       license calf. It was gotten separated from the herd and I guess they had seen it, but it now you could hear it. It was kinda over there bleeding. And, and, and, uh, they wanted to get it. They wanted to wrap it up. Meaning bleeding. Yeah. They make noise. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Not, not bleeding. Um, although that, that was probably the next step in this evolution, um, was uh, they were, they were trying to figure out how to round it up and get it back to its. And the Rangers, you know, said, okay, here we go again. And, and they said, look, this happens. Unfortunately people don't realize it's nature. So they had to get out. And I stood there and listened while they explain these people, look, this calf is somebody's dinner now, you know, it's going to be, you know, found and devoured by other forces of nature out.

Speaker 3:          02:20:14       Luckily wolves. Yeah. And uh, and there's a wolf population is coming back up there, which is great. And so these people were horrified. They were, they were amazed at the rangers wouldn't do something like, I guess catch the calf, put it in the back of the truck and drive it to the ticket to the zoo, take it to the zoo or take it to the herd or take it home and bottle feed it. It's not much you can do. And most likely if it's mother left it behind, maybe there's something wrong with the mother as well. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, who knows what the, what the reasoning was behind it. But it was, it was interesting. It was a good lesson. But that place is that the park system anyway, I think we've talked about that before. It's just astounding in this amazing. Oh my God.

Speaker 3:          02:20:51       Yeah. And the natural, uh, the, the uh, rather the national parks that, uh, that we have, uh, in, in Idaho in particular, you guys have a lot of public ally wilderness, uh, you know, into the Frank Church. Wildernesses insane the size. Um, I've read a really good book called the big burn if anybody's looking for a book to pick up and read, it's about this massive forest fire that took place mostly in Idaho and it was, um, during the course of, uh, of Teddy Roosevelt's time. And it also, it also covers Teddy Roosevelt, um, and his efforts and the way that he got turned on to conservation. Um, and the beginnings of the firefighting, you know, um, profession a forest fires. And it's a fascinating read. I mean, you think about it, people are going to go, really, I'm going to read a book about a big forest fire, but it's, it's incredible.

Speaker 3:          02:21:46       And they weave in the history and the time of the administration and how they were declaring parks and what they were doing and how they tried to tackle this fire and what that meant for future conservation term. And, and it's, it's, it's a fascinating book, so it's called the big burn. I'm drawing a blank on who wrote it, but if anybody's out there listening and wants to book, pick it up, how did they try to stop a fire back then? Especially a massive wildfire, you know, doing a lot of the same things that they do now, right? Cutting lines and breaks and trying to deprive it of fuel, feeding it back on itself. Um, it was, uh, just manpower, just sheer manpower and trying to um, and you know, putting up

Speaker 2:          02:22:26       the smoke towers and, and, you know, creating a, back then that's what they were doing. They were just out in the middle of nowhere. You try to, you try to space out these, these, um, outposts, these little points on a top of the mountains where you can identify smoke and try to catch it. You know, like if you've got an electrical storm, boom, then all of a sudden you see some smoke and you realize you probably got to start a fire. You want to get on it as quick as possible. So then nowadays you'll call and the smoke jumpers and they'll go in and that's an insane job, um, to try to contain it, put it out, but there's always been debate. What do you do? Do you let it burn, do you, how do you, how do you deal with it? Depends on the weather forecast as well.

Speaker 2:          02:23:03       Weather forecast and it, part of it was politics and it was me back then in Roosevelt's time, it was all the timber barons, right. And the mining barons and the railroad barons and you know, they weren't interested in, in Roosevelt's idea of claiming land for the public. Um, and so, you know, it, it was so fascinating. It's a fascinating read. And again, sort of go back to that same thing that we talked about it before, how did this nation could cobbled together and how did it end up looking the way it looked? And Roosevelt had some real vision. He really did. I mean, we're so thankful we should be so thankful because of that vision. We have this incredible national park system and all this public land. I talked to a wildlife biologist who said that that's one of the reasons why we have all these issues with like bark beetles and all these different, a dead tree issues that when we get a forest fire today, it's like so out of control because we don't allow these burns to take place, which they do naturally in nature.

Speaker 2:          02:24:01       Right? Yeah. And that's part of it because you can imagine what happens if you, if, if you don't do that, you develop the fuel over a long period of time, uh, and then you get a devastating fire. And, and also apparently the carbon from those trees burning is actually good for the ground. The soil it didn't know it is, it's very, it's the ability of the land to bounce back. We see it in not all the time. And you get up in Montana and in other parts, parts of Wyoming, you see how quickly. Yeah, the environment can, can bounce back. And how often do you see like wolves and grizzlies and stuff like that where you are wolves more than than grizzlies. The grizzlies is still. Yeah, they'll still, they, you know, they'll try to keep to themselves. Um, but, but you're seeing a ton of elk.

Speaker 2:          02:24:45       Yeah. More wolves. We had a lot of. Everybody's got coyotes, so they're so resilient. They are like the cockroach of the Mammal, you know? Yeah, they're pretty incredible. Um, but uh, it's, yeah, it's uh, I, I'd say if, if you're, you know, if you're looking at, um, an accessible trip and I get to ask this all the time, what would you do? Where would you go if you had like two weeks to take the kids and drive him somewhere? I would just point the car towards a Utah, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming and just, yeah, just head up there and then just see what you can see. You know, you've got plenty of opportunity to, a tremendous number of excellent parks and you know, show the kids something different. Yeah. Just let them understand these fats. Vast swaths of land that it just open wilderness. Take the electronics away to give me your.

Speaker 2:          02:25:40       I bet. Yeah. Oh yeah, yeah. Don't hide those in the trunk. God, we're starting to get the kids all start. I'll start school tomorrow and they know as soon as the school year starts, that's it. They don't get as much electronics now. Yeah, no more. I mean, unless they have homework or something like that, it's just too easy to find like escape in that from life and that life is critical for young minds and even being bored. I was reading something about the power of boredom and how important it is for creativity that is kids today are kids that are never bored. They never have to think of something to do. They can always just look at their phone or look at the TV and it never activates that part of their brain where they're searching and thinking. That's really interesting. I hadn't thought about that, but you're right.

Speaker 2:          02:26:23       Because we tend to plan everything for them. Okay. Now you got to go to your uh, whatever your hockey lesson. Go to Lacrosse, now it's going to be baseball, now you've got chess club or whatever the hell you doing. Um, yeah, you're right. And, and it's also kind of goes back to that idea that we use to manage these things for ourselves. Right. And so kids would go out and they would organize their own teams and I worry about that too. I mean, I like a God, you know, just the ability for kids to meet up at a playground and say, okay, we're going to end, you know, maybe it happens and I'm making too much of this, but we can't have that because bobby keeps getting picked last and it's terrible for his self esteem. Meanwhile, at Bobby's going to become a software coder that makes the ai that runs the world.

Speaker 2:          02:27:05       That's right. Now that's what happens, right? All the chickens get. Bobby. Bobby gets passed and bobby becomes mark Zuckerberg or Elon Musk. I just said chicks am my lead to say chicks, chicks, chicks. I was just like, you can still mock transracial people. Okay. Games all the broads. That's where it gets tricky. All abroad, you're going to want bobby. They've coder broads a weird one, isn't it? Because they're not really that broad. Yeah. I caught that happen in dames. We're not really private dix from the 19 thirties. So I guess what Dane was. Dane was I, I don't know. I think of the Maltese Falcon or something like that. Game a private. No, no, no. I mean, I mean they would say they would say yeah, the dame know walked in. My life changed, but broads is a weird one because it's fun to say because it's like a bunch of guys.

Speaker 2:          02:27:48       It's fucking broad. Broad. I love the saying that I feel like I should be smoking a cigarette. I'm saying bring a cigar for sure. Yeah. Martini. There's not a whole lot of things that chicks can say about us like that though. Like Bros. It's sorta like how black people never had a replacement word for the n word for white people. LIke honky just does not have any negative impact. It doesn't work, but like it's a throwback. It's a real historical throwback. Honky doesn't work. Remember the last time I heard anybody she trashed like whatever. That doesn't hurt. Yeah. But like broads is a funny derogatory term for what women don't. I guess burrows they have bros douche bags. Yeah. That's probably, that's probably what more more to the point. Frozen perspective. White oriented though bros are always white people. He never say a bunch of bros and it's black eyes.

Speaker 2:          02:28:36       I didn't know that. I didn't know what jamie. If you're younger, you'd be a fuck boy. Oh, that's true. That's called a fuckboy. Right. But that's a lot of people to like black people. Like that's ian edwards has that hilarious bit. It's a. It's everywhere. It's universal though. It's across the board. So we can all agree on fuckboy. Yeah. I don't know what that means. I don't. I don't mean like a derogatory term. Okay. Okay. Yeah, because I mean in some circles, who knows? Maybe that's a good thing. I don't know. Bright cougar wants to fuck. Boy. It's like speaking italian wrong. I'm sure I'm not getting it right. You got it right. Because if you're in a situation where you're like an old broad who's got a lot of money and you want some young. Fuck boy. Yeah. He wants a car, right? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:29:23       It's good man. Going to fuck boy is not going to sell for a prius. You had some personal trainer at kroger's. Got to spend some cash. Yeah. She's got to get him a ferrari. Sorta like how the guy who owned the uh, was it the clippers, that guy, the old man. What the fuck's his name? Donald sterling. Sterling memory had that broad. He got her. He had a broad right. He did have a broad, broad. Yeah. And he got her like a ferrari and a bentley and bought her a condo. But the broads used to work in the steno pool. Right. I mean, you know, the ones in the steno pool and the office environment back in the sixties. I know for full. Yeah, because if you needed to apply, you know, you'd have to, you'd have to get, you know, marge to come up from the steno pool and she would take notes and then, you know, do the letter or whatever the paper and you'd post it in the mail and that's how you get business done.

Speaker 2:          02:30:13       And that's aLert. Whoa. That's a standard thing. You gotta look at that. There's a lot of frauds. And that steno pool. If I was one of those [inaudible] I'd be like, I'd rather be a hooker. I gotta take this. Some dudes in there though, probably not be a steno pool now. Maybe just. Oh, okay. Guys there, they allowed them to work with women back then. I don't think so. Hold on. Steno pools to cubicles and back again. Wow. Fuck all that to you. Learned about standup pools. I learned about. Fuck boys. That's a trap. And a half though, isn't it? Imagine working in a place like that. I was like, what? Where are you going from here? And the other one was the, uh, the, uh, the telephone command center. Can we take that picture up on the upper top colored picture? Look right there. The one with the color in it.

Speaker 2:          02:30:59       No one with the girl holding up the sign. Oh, look at that. Swimming in the steno pool by lynn peril. Oh god. A retro guy to make it in the office. Fuck. Look at that. Big of that modern office equipment. They're there in the lower left hand corner. Gives you a sense of the date of that book. No more writing with a crayon. See, nowadays, a key office environment is much more dangerous now. I think it's much more fraught with potential for hazards and landmines. Look at that. That recording device there. Boy, let me do that thing. See, so he was talking and to transcribe all that. Is that what was going on? Like a dictaphone? What is with the guy with a bowler hat? This is a movie which was like a spy or something. Oh yeah, that's it. Because you know, we used to wear a dress like that.

Speaker 2:          02:31:50       I don't know if you could. You can zoom in on that, but that was actually. We would get that after we completed training, they would actually give us an outfit like that, the entire weight, the bowler hat and like, that's nice. And then we would set off on our adventures lakes. What's that new movie? The kingsmen. So what it is, bunch of spies out there kicking ass. I have not seen that. Teaching you deadly skills. Like how to kill people at upenn. They would teach you life skills. Like how to use regular field expediency. Yeah, I mean it's like knowing how to fire for whatever weapon you pick up off the ground. It's just simply knowing you know, what, what would work and most of it's common sense, right? I mean in terms of what would actually do the job, but yeah, I mean it's, it's just, it's just a field expediency, which is good.

Speaker 2:          02:32:39       Was it in madison? Practical information. Be polite, be professional, and have a plan to kill everyone. You meet madIson madison, who? I thought you were talking about. John madison. James madison. Wow. They were tough son of a bitches. Be like then. No. So mad. It's okay. Mad dog mattis. Love to say mad dog, didn't he? Yes. He was absolutely in love with mad dog with that name. Well, he liked it because he had his own life. Hitman. Yeah. You know, I don't know. What do you think this is going? Do you think he's in for four years and not anymore polite. Be professional, but have a plan to kill everyone. You meet madison. that's the kind of guy you want in that position. You want to go with things like that and anybody who doesn't understand that well good. I'm glad you're not in that position. Yeah, because.

Speaker 2:          02:33:23       And that goes back to Afghanistan. We were talking about what's the end game if you're going to do this, don't let it, let's not draw, you know, it kind of lets not do this thing where we're dying by paper cuts or whatever you wanna call it. And I just. And that's kind of where it's been. I just feel like we've been in a Holding pattern for years now when it comes to Afghanistan without really knowing where we're going or where we want to be when we get to the end of that road. And you know. So if somebody like madison and people in general in the military, I understand if you're going to do something, you do it to win, that's your objective. And I worry that, well maybe 40,000 troops is not exactly doing it to when it's doing what they feel they can get away with. And I don't know where that gets us. At the end of the day, this whole tRump thing is getting weirder and weirder with every day. So to even predict where we could be six months from now, forget about four years from now or three and a half years from now. I think that when you look at some of the stuff that he does, you really have to wonder

Speaker 4:          02:34:18       about his mental health and I don't, I don't say that like, you know, there's a lot of people that are saying that I think because, because they would like to think that he's mentally incompetent and it became convenIent for their argument. But when, when I read that, I don't know what agency it was, was trying to get the ip addresses of people that visited an anti trump website. Did you hear about that? Like sessions is working on. That's, that's insane. Because I could have visited that site if somebody sent me a link. You got to see this crazy anti-trump site. that doesn't mean I'm a part of that community or anything like that. You can't get ip addresses for him. Someone who visits things online either side.

Speaker 2:          02:34:56       Anytime it does. I don't care which administration it is. I mean, you can argue. I mean, yeah, it's just the potential for abuse of power. I've always agreed with that idea. I'm a small government person, so the potential for abuse of power is always there and needs to be monitored.

Speaker 4:          02:35:13       Potential catastrophic. Yeah, because as soon as people lose confidence and that's one of the biggest issues with trump as a president, if people lose confidence in the institution, like one of the things that was very disturbing to a lot of people was that when he had those russians over and he was explaining how isis is thinking about using laptops as bombs and they're like, jesus fucking christ, this is top secret shit. You're noT supposed to say that because then this could potentially compromise people that are embedded in isis that are distributing this information. Like you have a bunch of people that you're giving up this information. There's a trickle down effect and it also diminishes the potential for people to trust the office person running all

Speaker 2:          02:35:55       the time. You see that? I mean the previous administration had problems where they sort of in their desire to rush to the podium to declare a victory and something. There was a disregard for sources and methods of disregard for the importance of occasionally, you know, secrets are good on, uh, in, in many cases when it comes to intel operations, you want again, you want checks and Balances. That's, I completely get that. And of course people are losing their mindset going, I can't believe it's cia guy talking about checks and balances because, you know, I'm sure he doesn't believe it, but it's true. The place you know for that is in the committees and up on capital hill where you're supposed to have an engaged, aggressively curious, inquisitive. I'm operation up there between the various committees that are supposed are charged with overseeing, you know, the work of the intel community.

Speaker 2:          02:36:47       And, and oftentimes they do know exactly what's going on. They just play this game where they disavow any knowledge when it looks like this political blow back. there's a fairly well worn path between langley as an example in capitol hill for the briefings telling people this is what's going on, this is what's happening. And then, you know, the general unwritten understanding is, you know, they're going to be assholes. If it becomes politically expedient to do so, they'll disavow that they knew about it and they'll demand in, you know, and it's just so a game that gets played sometimes. But um, yeah, I think, um, I think that it's, it's, it's hard to say I've got, I've got friends who are very, a hard left and they're convinced that, that trump's on his way out in the not too distant future. I think that's a lot of wishful thinking, but I don't think he's gonna make it for years.

Speaker 2:          02:37:36       I might be wrong. It just doesn't seem like it. I think he's also incredibly resilient though, because he is, he's unusual in that regard. He's also a guy though that wants love and respect and wants to be a winner. Like everything he does it in regards to business decisions mean he, he'll take something personally himself to declare a victory. Right. And you got to wonder whether or not we would put someone in position, you know, to say like, the fake news is so out to get him to. What we've done is we've created a structure that's the best people for the job. And then I'm going to concentrate on business and helping them from the outside. you could escape and have some sort of escape route. There's not. Again, it sometimes seems as if there's no grownups in charge of the messaging that comes out of the white house.

Speaker 2:          02:38:26       Right. And that's Been the case since day one basically. And part of it is, you know, maybe people say, well, that's the way he likes to play. He likes to play people off of each other anD he likes the chaos. And they, well, you know why he never ran a big organization. People imagined or thought if they didn't, if they, you know, if you didn't spend any time up in New York and having watched the trump organization for years and years and years, if he hadn't done that, then you imagine it to be this massive organization. Well it's not, it's always been kind of a family business. Right. And it's just so the chaos that's around, that shouldn't be a surprise. What is a surprise is that, You know, he wasn't, he wasn't sharp enough for what I know what it is. They tend to understand the importance of inserting the discipline in there and at least if nothing else, being consistent and disciplined with the messaging that comes out and just quit the fucking tweeting.

Speaker 2:          02:39:19       People say, oh, I love it. That's what makes him him for people. It's an entertainment that, you know, it's a, it's a portal for fun, like fun. I mean, that's what you're getting out of it. You like seeing the stupid shitty rights and go, oh my god. And you correlate some of the time so that he writes it. Yeah, it's 2:00 in the morning. Is that interesting? I don't want, but that's the thing. I don't know. Again, I get it. I understand people, you know, people are excited to have a genuine person who's not a politician in there and you know, there's some benefit to shake the system up for sure and need some shaking, but you know, how much shaking is actually been done. I don't want that. I mean, I, you know, I'd rather the president not spend as much time watching tv or a tweeting, um, and working to try to accomplish something major in the way of tax reform or even the healthcare problem couldn't lord, we're not even to get that done.

Speaker 2:          02:40:13       I think there's also a real problem from the top down when the commander in chief likes to personally insult people. I think when you do that, you, you make that kind of behavior not just acceptable but standard. yeah. well it's like, well, with your kids and kids, you know, if they were probably more to the point, it's like people we talked about the fact that nobody can keep their yap shot, right? So secrets get out there right now and that's because we've created this environment. If it's okay for a former defense secretary, a former head of the cia or whatever, when they get out to write a book, right? And they're getting paid millions of dollars to write that book. So you know, they got to cough up something interesting. IF they do that over a period of time and they've been doing that, then people down below think, well, why the fuck yeah, all sign the same agreements to keep her yap shut, but maybe it's okay.

Speaker 2:          02:41:05       So it starts at the top. I think, you know, and it's just like with parenting, you know, I mean they got to see you do the things that you tell them to do. Otherwise kids are sharp enough to think, well you're not doing it right. You know? So I think it's, I don't know where I was going with that. I tend to get, I tend to get down the rabbit hole and distracted. This is a distracting subject because it's really difficult to see how do we get out of this? Like, well okay, we've, we've obviously got this guy who's running the country is doing a lot of things that people don't enjoy. They don't like. They see a lot of problems in it and they don't see a, a real light at the end of the tunnel. It's like what's the best case scenario? Is this guy going to get us in a fucking war with North Korea?

Speaker 2:          02:41:45       So we realized like, oh, North Korea and us, we know we're going to war now. This could have been avoided. We got to get rid of them. I mean, what's the worst case scenario that has to happen where we can survive as a country but still just recover from this. The North Korea thing is, is uh, is kind of frustrating in a sense, right? Because nobody should be out there thinking that. And I'm sure you know, very few do that somehow. We got to that point with North Korea because president trump is president, right? We got to this point when North Korea, because we kicked the can down the road for two and a half decades of failed foreign policy with North Korea and in part with China. And so they've been very clear about what they wanted to do and now they've gotten to that point where they've created the weapons program and the ballistic missile program that they want or that they are close to having.

Speaker 2:          02:42:41       And you knoW, when you get to that point, you naturally lose some of your options, you know, so the decision tree gets smaller and you know, trump happens to be the president in office now when North Korea reaches that stage and North Korea is pretty consistent in the way that they've been behaving, you know, they're always doing the same thing. They throw their teddy out of the cot when they get upset and they want some attention where they feel they can get something out of it. Typically they do get something or China get something that then they're willing to reign them in

Speaker 3:          02:43:12       to some degree, um, in just like, you know, trump could well Be the guy sitting in an office where Iran gets to that point because anybody who thinks Iran is not spinning the centrifuges and continuing to work on their weapons capabilities is, is somewhat insane. I mean that, there is no, uh, john kerry said the whole Iran deal was based on verification, you know, on. And we don't have verification. We don't have, we don't, we haven't gotten access still to some facilities that we would need to see. We signed off with the previous administration, signed off on a, on a study or a, an assessment basically just to get the deal done because the iranians insisted that that investigation into their capabilities at one of their military sites come to a close. It wasn't like we suddenly got answers and we were satisfied tHat there was no. And we just, okay, that was part of the deal. So we'll end that investigation, but we don't have that verification. so trump could do my point being trump could just be sitting in that seat, uh, when North Korea gets where they are when Iran possibly, you know, because that could happen sooner rather than later. And then, yeah. Then you'd like to think that the person in that position will be rational. Yes. Little more reasoned.

Speaker 4:          02:44:25       I read an article today that is saying that, that him saying all that crazy shit about fire and fury at the world has ever seen, might've actually Been what he needed to say. When you're dealing with someone like North Korea. And I mean, it was obviously an opinion piece, but the argument was that when you're dealing with someone does as fucked up as kim jong, you're probably better off having someone as crazy as trump as president who's going to say some ridiculous shit like that. So this guy goes, all right, this guy's just as nuts as me.

Speaker 3:          02:44:57       Does that mean that there could be. And frankly, those messages that he's, he does his things that he said were probably more important in terms of how China received them. Then how North Korea received them, and honestly, 20 plus years of, of measure diplomatic language and restrained talk didn't really do anything. It just kicked the can down the road. So yeah, maybe, maybe a different approach in a measured fashion. But the problem is because of their sort of the perceived chaos, nobody has the confidence to believe that he's doing it in a disciplined, reasoned way. So they don't look at it and go, yeah, he's saying that's a message he's sending it. Just looked at it and go, you just go blasting off another tweet up, Scott Adams.

Speaker 4:          02:45:42       Scott adams is the only one that believes this is some large, clever masterplan. We mIss scott as a dilbert. dilbert. Yeah. I know about that. Scott adams, like the most rational, logical, intelligent trump supporter that's ever lived and he's not really a trump support. Support. Didn't vote for trump because he talks about these things. He doesn't want to vote for president because he doesn't want to have a stake in the game, but he believes that trump is a master persuader and that everything he's doing is because of the art of persuasion. It's very interesting. Interesting. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:46:10       I'd falls apart under scrutiny. Kind of fell apart with his art. These, these arguments with a podcast with sam harris is pretty fascinating. No, I mean it's, it's, it's. I can see where people. I've heard that from trump supporters when they talk about how he's. Everything's measured. Everything in his own way. His is, is actually disciplined because I've said numerous times that I think they lacked discipline and they said, no, no, no, no. Actually this is all part of the plan. I'm thinking it doesn't look like it's part of the plan because you've got other people that are in those senior positions that seem to be scrambling to catch up to the plan. And if it was part of the plan, he'd like to think it was, you know, it was, it was part of a conversation amongst the, uh, the cabinet. But anyway, uh, yeah, so I, I don't think, you know, I don't think we're.

Speaker 2:          02:46:58       Missiles aren't going to be flying between us and North Korea. I think China may actually see at this stage of the game, um, they may see that they need to, uh, affect the different mindset for North Korea and they may be doing that and part of it may be, again, not necessarily because it was a reason to thought out plan, but trump's comments about the trade imbalance with China. If the chinese legitimately thought that we were going to put that under the microscope and maybe attack them on the trade imbalance in a serious way, then maybe they look at that and go, okay, well we can get them to back off. Then. Yes, we're willing to extend ourselves and actually listened to the sanctions and take part in the sanctions and exert some additional pressure on North Korea that maybe they weren't in the past because China always accidents own best interest and so they're, they're looking for something, what are we going to get out of this?

Speaker 2:          02:47:47       And maybe so maybe that's, you know, in. Anyway, in the meantime it seems to have resolved itself to some degree, but I, I do worry that, you know, once again, and we're Just kicking it down the road, you know, I mean until there's something, some sea change where, you know, maybe somehow we can affect a unified, you know, uh, Korea with china's assistance. It's going to have to be with their assistants and blessing obviously a or something along those lines to get actual deterrence, you know, off the table and more of a removal of the nuclear threat. you know, we're just going to be doing this same conversation in another couple of years when they rattle the cage again and we have to figure out how to resolve it. And the further you go down the road and the better their capabilities get, the fewer options you have. So. Well mike, I'm sufficiently depressed. Thank you very much. My job. Will this meet up again at six months if the shit hits the fan? So you know, it's always fun talking to you about your insight. I went off on a tangent there, don't we both did. That's part of the program. cool man. Thank you brother. Appreciate it. Thank you. All right fOlks. We'll see you soon.

Speaker 5:          02:48:50       Bye.
