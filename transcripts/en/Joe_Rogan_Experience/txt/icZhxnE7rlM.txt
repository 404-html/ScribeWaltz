Eddie Bravo. Good googly Mooglie. What does that mean? That's a Joey d is this thing now everybody's saying it. If people say it all the time when you see something fucking crazy, he goes, good googly Mowgli duck. I haven't heard that yet. That must be brand now. It's a fairly recent one. A Joey's been doing it for the past. I'm sure it's an old saying like you remember the Sasquatch, Hannah hat store. He went off about the weed. What? Hannah? We, we didn't know what the fuck

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       that meant. I bet. Good googly Mowgli's like that. It's probably something that dude's used to say to each other. I remember that. You remember good googly Mowgli? I think they used to say going in cartoons a lot, actually like old. Now that you're saying that, I kind of remember that. Googley can. Where did, okay, let's Google the origin of good googly Moodley. You think that would, uh, possibly everything comes up, man. Yeah, right. Okay. Let's say the origin of good, good blue moon. Yup. Urban Dictionary. Wow. Anywhere for awhile. What are you, what are you doing currently? What are you play on the commercial? It has it on there. It's old. They're not going anywhere for awhile. Great. Currently Mister Magoo would say something like that. Yeah, I remember my, I think my grandfather used to say it or something or it used to be in the old looney tunes or, well, it's in the urban dictionary and if phrase used when a real thick female walks by and you want to say, damn, that's like an update. They're basically co-opted it. They hijacked it. Great. Googly movie

Speaker 3:          00:10:13       orange. How long is it going to take for Jelly? D has to be like an alias to act or just a tremendous phenomenon. Yeah, exactly right.

Speaker 1:          00:10:22       Here's the origin. Here's the origin. Great Google, good googly mcgleesy and Frank Zappa's Song Nanak rubs it. The song was released in 1974 the term is now used as an utterance of great surprise. Oh Wow. I like the wonder years definition better. Yeah. Well that's, it works today. That's the urban dictionary.

Speaker 3:          00:10:46       So you see a girl. That's true. You can say something out loud. Good. And Yeah, you could, and it's not offensive. How could a girl get pissed off at that? Especially if you're not looking at her. Yeah. You know what? A [inaudible] hanging out with a couple of Brazilian guys and there's one Brazilian guy that he says what his pickup line was. My gotch like you would just go, my God, that works in Brazil. Great. But not in the states. Oh my God. That's all you need to Brazil. That's all. Yeah, exactly. You just grab them and you just take them. Girls are used to that shit. What is it about Brazil that's there's way more girls in those countries? Like Brazil and Argentina are very similar and that there's way more girls than there has guys. In the beginning when we first started training Jujitsu, the Machados, we hear all these stories about Brazil and we all thought Jujitsu was his biggest soccer in Brazil based on what they were telling us. And they'd say, man, when you go to Brazil at 11 girls fabric guys, grant humble and what I what? So these Americans

Speaker 4:          00:11:54       and should dudes it Carlos Machado's guys, all the Texas guys, we gotta go, we gotta go to Brazil. So in 2000 we went to check it all out. And uh, it's true, there is a, you just see that there's more girls like statistically it's gotta be, cause you see it and you even see it more in Argentina, I was in Argentina three years ago and you see just droves and gangs of girls just all together. But they react different to the situation in Argentina and Brazil. In Brazil, it's, it's a lot easier to make moves on checks in Brazil, but in Argentina it backfired. So girls are in Argentina there, they're just like, they don't trust dudes. At all cause dudes can, can easily have multiple girlfriends and prostitution is totally legal. So girls in Argentina pissed off and they're like, why should I trust you?

Speaker 4:          00:12:45       You're going to definitely have other girlfriends and, and if I pissed you off, you're going to go right to the whorehouses proved to me that you, you know, so they're pissed off the girls. That's, that's my experience in Argentina. That's the one argument, I mean against the prostitution is that it forces, it allows rather guys to not be forced into relationship. Like how do you develop meaningful relationships and have children and all that jazz. There's legalized prostitution everywhere because if you've got a couple of bucks and someone starts talking Shit, you just go, I'm crying. You know, like you start going, I don't need this. I don't need, I don't need someone in my life yelling at me just so I can get my sex. I could just go right over there. The guy that was taking us around in Argentina, we had a guide.

Speaker 4:          00:13:29       He said that it's very typical that you go out on a date with a chick. You're just, you know, you try to civilians, you try and say, well, you know, the, the whore houses are always going to be there. So he said he would just take a girl to a club and need to be dancing and if you know, he'd start putting his hands on, on the dance floor and trying to grab her ass. And if she wasn't intuitive, she didn't respond. He would just say, I'm going to the bathroom and just go right out and jump in a cab and go right to the whorehouse he had no patience is telling us. So that's where the girls are so pissed because girls are used to that. Girls are used to guys just saying, okay, I'm out. You know? Yeah. They don't have to take any, they don't have to beg basically.

Speaker 4:          00:14:07       What does that do to a culture that's very strange when you stop and think about it, you know, because I'm, I'm a person that believes totally and personal freedom and I don't think there's anything wrong with someone being a prostitute if they want to be a prostitute. I think if you were working at Denny's serving people food for fucking $3 an hour, or someone says, Hey, you're getting a hundred bucks an hour, you could fuck a bunch of Nice guys. You know why not? Why not do that? I'm not saying that it should be something that people pursue, but why is it okay to give someone a hug? Why is it okay to give someone a massage and it's not okay to suck their deck? Why is they have a great point? Hey, you can pay for a massage. Someone who doesn't want to touch you, rubs on you for an hour and a half, but you, you're me that the

Speaker 5:          00:14:51       first of all, we both know there are crazy girls out there that would probably love to blow a bunch of guys all day. They exist. They do porn. Yeah. I don't know why they exist, but they exist. You could say they exist because of the abuse. He could say they exist because of childhood neglect. That's possible. I agree. But they exist. And it's not like you're supporting that market by creating whorehouses like the market that, that those people are going to be there no matter what you do unless you clean up society. So you're always gonna have people that are off the rails. Why not? That's the, is that the big one disease, because you have to control the disease with a back massage or not getting fucking aids. Well, I, you know what crazy that you would think out of all the people on the, on the planet, hookers would be the first to get aids and they're not really getting aids.

Speaker 5:          00:15:35       Isn't that crazy? I don't know if anybody's really checking on hookers going like, hey, how you doing? Well, you know, you listened to that guy you had on your podcast, dude. Duisburg he said in Brazil, virtually none of the hookers have aids. I don't know if he's going down there with the fucking pap smear. That motherfucker, I don't know about Duisburg man. I do not know. Um, I found his, the conversation with him to be absolutely fascinating and very confusing. And I, you know, use the phrase, uh, I hate it when I'm too dumb to know who is stupid. You know, I don't know if this one guy has it nailed and all these other doctors are out of their mind and they were all chasing a disease. It doesn't exist. That doesn't make enough sense to me. It doesn't make enough sense when this guy starts talking about HIV and that HIV doesn't cause aids, but yet everyone else thinks does like this is like serious peer reviewed scientists that think it does.

Speaker 5:          00:16:31       So that's just confuses the shit out of me. He makes a lot of sense though. It makes a lot of sense. That's what even break it down were another debate him and Callen had, I mean it seemed at the very end of that it seemed like as a skeptical is Brian is it seemed like at the very end based on your podcasts, it sounded like he was starting to believe that it's a bad situation. First of all, it's unfair because Brian is not a geneticist. He has no, no engineering background or no bio a engineering background. He has no idea what Duisburg does for a living. Like his concept of like how it all works is so rudimentary. It's like, so for him to debate a guy like that, it's not fair. He shouldn't have been doing it. Um, I, I wanted to have him on because he's a smart dude and you should get something to, yeah, I tried.

Speaker 5:          00:17:22       Nobody wants to do it. It's really hard. I hired, one of the reasons why we started working with Matt stags is that very reason to be able to get guests like that, to be able to get, um, you know, use a publicist to reach out and let someone know that this is a legitimate showed we're trying to get to the bottom of something. No one wanted to touch it. No one will. One guy wanted to touch it and then he had all this backlash apparently from his peers. People don't want you even debating Duesberg. They think that it's almost like debating a holocaust denier. You know, debating someone, uh, know who, who believes really dangerous shit. And so they think that his, what his work has done, it's killed many, many people. I don't buy that though. My problem with, I don't buy, I think the truth is somewhere in the middle, but these, these people that say, you know, doozer burgers responsible for all these people in Africa, not taking their medication and all dying.

Speaker 5:          00:18:13       His points about Africa were really fascinating. He was talking about how in Africa they say that everyone has aids but they're not testing for HIV. They're, they're assuming these people have aids because their immune system is trounced, but you're also dealing with people that are exposed to a wide variety of other disorders and diseases and they have terrible, terrible, terrible nutrition and it's, these people were not getting proper healthcare and when you see they're sick, if they have aids in quote, at least you know that that qualifies for them to have funds for them to get funding. If you're dealing with an AIDS epidemic, you get money, you get money from charities for an aids epidemic, you don't get money. You know, based on the fact that people aren't eating right, you don't get money based on the fact that immune system sucks because they're in a fucking tropical jungle.

Speaker 5:          00:19:00       I talked to this disease expert, um, when I was doing that Scifi show and he said that people live in jungles, like people who live in tropical environments. On 100% of them have diseases, hundred percent. He's like, they've all got something. He goes, everyone has something. And I was like, what do you mean like something he's like, there's all sorts of different diseases. There's under the undiagnosed diseases, there's ailments and they just live with, there's parasites that get in their system. It's just, it just, they get it. That's like the toxoplasma thing that we talked about. Yeah. That's why it's like that. That kind of environment. How does it chick that lives in the Amazon jungle get into a river and not have vaginal parasites? How is that possible? They got to be covered with vaginal parasites. That must be a problem in the jail. We already have them from drinking water.

Speaker 5:          00:19:47       Does it make their pussy feel better? No. It gives you a buck and bumpy and Dick Dick Parasites pick leeches, little tiny microscopic ones that dude's pull out on their own level and every time they pull it out, it's not checking the town. You're not joking around, man. There must be. I'm just saying there must be no listen man. When dudes pissed in the Amazon, they have to cover their dick used to piss into your hand. You gotta cover your Dick Because fish will swim up your urethra tape. Worms coming out of your penis hole. That's not bullshit though. They find your urine and they swim up river into your deck and then they, you have to cut them out. Why do they need, isn't it? Wouldn't it be easier if they weren't pissing? Dude, the world is trying to kill you. No, but if you weren't pissing and young little lagoon, isn't it easier but can't find the hole and it follows the river of pis, swims up the river.

Speaker 5:          00:20:37       It's evolved. Like follow the river like salmon swim up to your mind to, I used to have a jury about that. I used to have a joke about that. I did know there was a real disease that did that. I used to joke about it being at a strip club and peeing really hard cause I was scared that the vd from the toilet was going to swim up river and my Dick. That's hilarious. But I didn't know that they really like got something actually does that free. We'd Rogan right there. It is 99 Rogan. There's a rat actually fish that does that. Like a parasite cleanse. A call to your deck. Okay, let's find out. Swims and Amazon chicks, which it Amazon fish swims in music. You know the kind of condom you would need? You would need a fucking, NASA would have to make that condom made out of Levi's and have to be one of those condoms that are actual shorts too.

Speaker 5:          00:21:28       It's one piece. They're like booty shorts and a condom all in one. Oh, this thing is got the tape that it'd be too hard. It's called the Ken Guru. The candy room, uh, is a toothpick fish or vampire fish. A species of parasitic freshwater catfish. Ah, native to the Amazon basin where it's found in countries like Bolivia, Brazil, Columbia, Ecuador, and Peru. Jesus Christ. Oh, just swims. Wow. The smaller species are known for a tendency to Nva alleged tendency to invade parasites and parasites, the human urethra. However, despite ethnological reports dating back to the late 19th century, the first documented case of the removal of the candy row from a human urethra did not occur until 1997 and even that incident has remained a matter of controversy. Huh. So it might be bullshit. Did they might have anal catfish. Well, look at that thing. How's that going to get into tip of your Dick?

Speaker 5:          00:22:31       Unless you want it to my shifts. That could definitely get into vaginas. Yeah. Yeah. Of girls will be in there. Fucking Amazon Shit. Wow. This is weird. Okay, so this might totally be bullshit. Historical accounts. Earliest published reports of this can dirus attacking a human host comes from the German biologist, CFP von [inaudible] in 1829 who never actually observed it, but rather was told about it by the natives of the area, including that man would tie a ligature around their penis going into the river. Then this are happening. You know what that meant? That meant dude's where they had cock rings on and they got busted and then like, no, no, no. There's a fish to fry up your Dick. Dude, you sound like a prophetic to take a trip into the Amazon and one dude's all into bang and Amazon chicks in here. Like, Dude, look at this man. No, it's bullshit. I totally believe it. It makes sense. Yeah. All that kind of does, but it seems like there was only one case where one was pulled out of a dude's Dick. Maybe they just, they're just comfortable with them and they just live with them. They just know him. Well, let's go Google up. Can dirus removed from deck is probably a kind of put it in his dick. Yeah, that's what they're saying. That's what they're saying. They're saying Amazon girl vaginal parasite.

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       Ooh, here's, here's something on aol.com about an eel that swam up somebody's penis and it had to be surgically removed. Okay, well hold on a second.

Speaker 1:          00:24:52       This is fucking madness. This is a real thing. This fish really does swim in your Dick and you got to send this dude in there with a vacuum cleaner, a vacuum cleaner with a camera in the end of it to suck it out of there. And then the fish is swimming away from your deck. Is this in the Amazon or what it says, what does this happen? Um, yes, it said it lodged in the penis of Silvio Barbosa after urinating in the air. Amazon River, tributary, doctor and new, our Ahmad removes the Kundera fish in a two hour operation. Dude, he's got to keep going in there. Look at how many there are in there. Oh my God. Oh my God.

He, he did some stuff with them to his, um, I forget his last name, but anyway, he uh, does dude got k owed and he was like singing a song forum.

Speaker 6:          00:26:40       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:26:41       Was it as fighters? No, it was the other day. Who's taking care of, you know, corners and Chet and so, you know how they have a bunch of different, um, guys who are trainers or, or a commission, guys who washing guys and who are, you know, taking care of various things. Like cut man and stuff like that. And they run in and take care of corners doing various things. So they're not that night. He wasn't part of that wasn't with that guy. Exactly. So the, um, I don't know, you know, it was exact a business he was doing there anyway when the dude was out, he was singing them when the Iowasca song and I, and I, and I, you know, I talked to him about it and he's like, he's in the place of the dreams. You know, I tried to make them comfortable comfort while he was there, at least serious about it. It's pretty, pretty intense. You know, he's a, he's an Iowaska Shaman, so he'll, he do, he does like ceremonies and shit. Damn. Yeah. Yeah. So it was, it was pretty cool. How often do you see, when we see him all the time, tell him I'm interested in doing a ceremony with him. He'll do it. Yeah, I'm down. We'll come down, we'll bring them down to a list or wants to do this. I'm not doing that with him,

Speaker 3:          00:27:45       you know, too much troubles. Troubles really

Speaker 1:          00:27:50       MMA fighter. He's like, I like dean. He's a good dude, man. Because he retired from MMA.

Speaker 3:          00:27:57       I don't know, but I was with him all weekend in China for Abu Dhabi. Did he can be, he did. How did he do? He did great. He had four or five heel hooks. He didn't win the gold medal in anything, but he may have gotten third in his division. Grappler, Dude's this year. Holy Shit. China stinks. And if I never go back there again, I mean it stinks. Like literally like my bathroom and my hotel stunk. Like the sewer. It was like the water, they turn off the water and then they turn it on. But uh, the people are beautiful in China. They're beautiful, but they just have a problem in Beijing with their sewers. Man. It's just, whew. You walk down the street and every block and like, whoa, Jesus, what's your, just too many people, someone die or does someone take a shit? Um, I don't know if it's that it's just old, but Abu Dhabi was amazing.

Speaker 3:          00:28:55       The whole, the tournament. Jesus Christ, I was so much. So, I mean, uh, uh, you know, Amir alum, one of my brown boats thought in the heavyweight division and he trained his ass off man. He was ready, he was on fire and we get to an unknown in the first round. So we're thinking, awesome. We should beat this guy. We didn't, his last name was dop, Jared. Dot. We thought, okay, we should be able to beat this guy this, because he could easily had cyborg in the first round. Right? You could easily have [inaudible] on the first round. That would have been, fuck, okay, good luck. You know? But people

Speaker 1:          00:29:32       don't understand. There's a bunch of Cyborg. You only heard of a Cyborg. The woman fighter Cyborg turns out her ex husband is an MMA fighter named Cyborg,

Speaker 5:          00:29:42       but there's a Roberto I brew. Is that how you say? Yeah, it bad ass.

Speaker 7:          00:29:46       She won the absolute, he's amazing. This guy impressed the shit out of me. He's so big. He's a fucking ox buddy. Moves like a gazelle dude. It was incredible. There's a couple of passes that he did just blew my mind. I'm like running it and I'm on the plane on the way back going over that pass, like I can't forget that pass. I got to analyze it. It was amazing tech that was at least 10 different techniques, right? Logged it in my brain. I got to go back and check that one out. Like, yeah. Cabrina the guy who wanted all into lightweight, he finally beat half a Mendez man, have Amanda's one the last two years. He's virtually indestructible. Uh, and Cabrina. We're in the finals again and Cabrina one that he pulled it out a judge's decision at the end. They couldn't sport a score. Any points on the chart, they just canceled

Speaker 5:          00:30:32       about those though. Those are weird when the judges make a score and I don't have a real problem with that.

Speaker 7:          00:30:38       Well, the one thing I love about Abu Dhabi is the chic is he's, I mean, he's such a bad ass. The sheet just decides to put together the Best Jujitsu tournament on the plan. He just makes it happen. He pays for it. It's all all, all over the world. One year. It's an Sao Paulo, one years in Barcelona, it's an La to China. It's amazing. The sheik just throws down and he makes it happen. And he, he created the rules, Eh, the format based on what he thought would be best for the entertainment value. So he's down to evolve over the years. He's tweaked stuff. He's like the Japanese, the Japanese and pride. As soon as they recognize a problem, the fucking chain.

Speaker 5:          00:31:19       True people have no idea what we're talking about. The, uh, Abu Dhabi is Abu Dhabi combat championships, right? Combo club. They have the biggest Jujitsu, no Geek Jujitsu tournament in the world. They have this huge thing and it's put together by, and he sees them talk noon. Yeah. He, uh, is also part owner of the UFC and he's a black belt in Jujitsu is a huge [inaudible] fan. So you put together like this enormous grappling competition that's the most prestigious grappling, a event in the world. And so Eddie was just there in China with war fighters. So how did he do it again? Let's do it

Speaker 7:          00:31:53       well, well, let me finish what I was talking about. The chic is a, we're talking about, we're getting to the format, the rules. Yeah. So, you know, one of the coolest thing that he changed was the same day, Wayne. He changed that shit. And not only is it because I generally, especially in MMA and pro MMA, you weigh in officially the day before and then you have 24 hours to recover. So that's huge in deciding what weight category you're going to compete in and how you're going to lose the weight. How are you going? It's massive. If you have to do a same day, way in, Ooh, shit, everything changes. Now you can't have that crazy diabolical cut that you're, you're used to. Now it's a little different. And the IBJ I've changed it to, they may get you weigh in right before you step the mat and if you way, uh, even a pound over, boom, you're gone.

Speaker 7:          00:32:43       So Abu Dhabi, the sheik, he, he'd add, added did the same thing you do. Not only is it same day wins, but you've got to weigh in that you've got to win the day before the day of and the next day if you make it to the third, uh, the third round, you have to keep weighing in. It's gonna say, cause it seems kind of dangerous if you just did it right before you went and got some guys would still probably push themselves too. Yeah. What I mean it's risky because you, you see these high level grapplers every now and then you see them gas and they try to cut too much weight and you don't have that much time to recover. So if you're going to do a same day way in, especially Matt Sideway and man, you just got to get in the best shape of your life and figure out what weight that is and you really, you really can't cut really, or you're going to pay for it.

Speaker 7:          00:33:23       You're going to gas out. And some people still take the chance to though. But with the rules, the sheik decided the best thing to do to ensure action most of the time, because no matter how you put together the rules, you're going to, not every match is going to be exciting. You have to accept that, but you're always looking to make, make the majority are just striving for the majority of the matches to be exciting. So in Abu Dhabi, every tournament does shit different. But and Abu Dhabi, they're 10 minute matches, the finals or 20 minute matches. But in these 10 minute matches, the first five minutes, there's no points at all. They don't count anything. And the second five minutes, that's when the points started. And if you pull guard, you lose a point. So that, that's huge when strategizing for a fight. Because when you're competing in this, explain to people why the first five minutes, there's no point.

Speaker 7:          00:34:12       So that was something that was instilled. Yeah, that was instilled so that if there's no points you'd be a fighter's would, would take more chances. Because generally if there's points counting all the time, you don't want to take any chances. One wrong slip dudes up two points. Now he's up, he's just going to hold. He doesn't really think about the submission. He's just trying to get to the next round. So it changes the dynamics of your strategy and and how it, how it plays out. So the sheik thought, okay, let's, let's, let's try to shake it up first five minutes, no points. So the fighters will take more chances and that turns into entertainment for the viewer. So that happens sometimes with some fighters and Jacques Machado, he took advantage of that. He went out there, pulled guard and got the party rolling. He's like, okay, I'm going to sit down.

Speaker 7:          00:34:55       You get on top, let's go. I'm not going to spend five minutes trying to take you down. I'm not a wrestler. You wrestles your whole life. Let's just get the party started. I'll get, I'll let you get on top. I'll kick the ball off to let you, I'll let you receive first. How about that? That's all that is. So in the first round guys will do that. They're like, I'm not going to spend all my energy trying to take a deep down. It's not a wrestling competition. So they sit down, the problem is in the second half of the match, if you decide to sit down, you lose a point. So the ref goes points at five minutes. So wherever you're at the next transition that, uh, you know, uh, like if you already have the guys back at that five minute mark, they don't give you the points.

Speaker 7:          00:35:31       You have to lose the back and then get it back. So a lot of weird stuff that I didn't understand, but, but gem, but again, the point of this weird, uh, format is to make it better. So the chic is always trying to make it better. And the one thing I'm pretty sure he's going to, he's, he's got to change that. Uh, losing a point if you pull guard, cause that changes a lot. We saw a lot of, not a lot, but a couple of the finals were both Jujitsu guys, worldclass, Jujitsu guys. I Cabrina and Hoffa, some of the two best guys in the world. Very good at submissions. Amazing at passing. Unbelievable. Beautiful Jujitsu. Well you hadn't, and their match is nobody wanted to pull guard cause in that in the finals you lose a point right away. They don't give you, it's not the first half.

Speaker 7:          00:36:16       No point in that really good. Those come from God just having shitty guards. It comes from people not realizing how dangerous a guard is. If a guys a real bad motherfucker with it. Yeah. And we saw that too. One of the competitors came in. He's a 22 year old kid. Him and his brother, real famous. They just got their black belts there. The meow brothers are like Machita like half Japanese, half Brazilian from Brazil, like the kitty cat. But it's like Sao Paolo meow meow meow cat. It could be, but it's spelled I think am I, why does she get Brian to design a shirt? Totally. Well these guys, all they do is pull guard and play della haven spiral guard relentlessly. They don't stop. That's all they do. They're relentless. They have an infinite amount of cardio and that's, that's his style. He sits on his zero wrestling.

Speaker 7:          00:37:02       So that's why he lost, he lost because Bam. So what ends up happening with this rule set, which was aimed at making it more entertaining, but what's happening now? Um, and I'm sure the sheikhs going to see this because everyone's talking about it on the Internet. I'm not the only one. Everyone's talking, everyone as Deborah watching, everyone came to the same conclusion and like, oh, there's a problem here. We've got a problem. The chic is one of those guys that will fix it and he, and he's got to fix it because the problem was we had co Breena and Hoffa in the finals and they never, they never try. They just tried to take each other down and they couldn't because they're not wrestlers. The wrestling's decent, you know, but, uh, according to, due to no wrestling, like due to wrestled in college, they'll say they're at like a high school state champion level, you know, not d one, all American Johnny Hendricks level, whole different animal.

Speaker 7:          00:37:56       So we ended up getting is 20 minutes of two dudes who have okay wrestling, you know like d five rustling going at it and we don't see any Jujitsu cause no one want to anyone. They don't want to pull guard. Oh yeah, yeah. It's way easier to not get taken down than to take someone down. It's way easier. Like if your whole focus is, I'm not going to get taken down and you're going to check me down. Even if you wrestled in college and I didn't wrestle him cause it's still gonna be hard for you to, of course I have to work on it. But you can get that take down defense a lot quicker than you can turn. Exactly. Exactly. I take down ability, man, that takes a no, no long time. It's sprawling can come easier. So what you end up having as two dudes that uh, were wrestling for a very long time, they got to the ground briefly a couple times and they went to double overtime, triple overtime when Friday at the very end, zero, zero.

Speaker 7:          00:38:48       The rough makes the decision and gave it to Cabrina. So how does that work? How can I make a decision like that? That's what the initial, that's how we got started off. That doesn't make any sense to me. I don't buy that. The how is that going to walk away with a win? I mean, I understand that they were, you know, they're the elite of the elite and to have the best of the world, I guess someone has to win, but that doesn't make any sense to me. Yeah. The rules need revamping and I'm quite positive that the sheik is going to take that because what you end up having, if you don't lose a point for pulling guard, it's, you know, losing a point for pulling guard. It's like this. I, I use a football analogy when I'm trying to explain Jujitsu to someone who doesn't know anything about Jujitsu.

Speaker 7:          00:39:31       I do you understand that the rules of football and the strategy and most Americans do, so it's just like football. There's generally a guy has a ball and that the team has, has the ball and they're marching down the field and then a team is defending. Try not to let them march down the field. Same thing. Guy On top in Jujitsu is trying to march down the field. Gone bottom is playing defense. He the guy on defense can score but it's not a, it's a lot easier to score when you're on top and you can use your weight cause you have, it's like you have the ball, you're scoring, but the defensive football team can intercept and run back for a touchdown. They can score. Some teams are very high so but it's rare. Same thing with the bottom. It's rare that there's guys that can score a lot off their back, but generally you want to be on top, you want to have the ball.

Speaker 7:          00:40:13       If you're on top, you're in someone's open guard. It's like you're on the 20 yard line. You get on to top half, you're like at the 50 yard line, you pass the side control. You can score from side control, but it's a lot easier if you score from the back. So I controls like the 35 yard line. The amount is like the 20 yard line. Now you're in the red zone. And if you get the dude's back first and go on the 10 that's basically, it's the same thing. You're marching down the field. You're getting into scoring position. Yes. You can score from midfield. You know you could score from top half. You could throw a guillotine, you can throw Darcy's, but it's easier when you're on their back. It's easier when you're right there. Hundred 10 yard line, so in football, the way they start the game as the ref flips a coin, someone, one of the teams picks heads or tails and a, I think it's the visiting team and then if it's heads, whoever wins the coin toss gets to decide who receives and who kicks off.

Speaker 7:          00:41:06       Generally a large percentage of the time. If you win the coin toss, you say, we're going to receive and you're going to kick off. We're going to be on offense first. You're going to be on defense first. I'm going to be on top and you're open guard. You're going to be on the bottom. You flip a coin, you have to choose. Fuck. Yeah. Generally I would do, I would say, wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait. So you're saying that you should do a match where you flip a coin to say no, no, no, no, no, no, no. What I'm saying is what I'm saying is, so, uh, sometimes a team will choose to kick off and not receive. That's kind of like if we're going to grapple and I sit down, I chose to play defense first. That's what a guard pooler. If it doesn't happen that often, so it's penalizing someone one point for sitting on their butt for letting the guy get on top.

Speaker 7:          00:41:52       He's working to get on top of you. Worked very hard on his wrestling to get on top of the dude is saying, I'm kicking off to you. You receive, I'm going to let you go first. That's like a, like a team saying we're going to kick off to you and losing three points for it. Like you, you are already giving them an advantage. You're going to lose, lose the advantage and points doesn't make any sense. You understand what I'm saying? Dude. See I could see if so say if they don't have points, you know they don't score points, you know, um, with their, their idea of advantage. Maybe you could say you could give someone an advantage if a guy pulled guard. It's still a point cause she said it went like that. If you give an advantage is still one zero zero with the the guy who has the advantage of [inaudible] algae actually really it should be, it shouldn't be laughing.

Speaker 7:          00:42:37       It should be like this and she that'd be submission only. That's it. And you have overtime rounds and I could explain that if you want here, but generally of submission only, no points, no advantages. It's all about who gets the submission. The whole goal is to get some mission because in a lot of that was epic matches. There's incredible athletes. I have respect for all of them. But when you're under this rule set you, there's a lot of times in these matches where the submission wasn't even a thought. Just the w there were matches where there's like three minutes left. Guys sat on his ass, he loses a point. Now I'm on top. I want to win that money at the end cause the winner of each division wins $10,000. He's the guy on top automatically is going to be very cautious, reserved and not uh, be aggressive and definitely not even consider a submission.

Speaker 7:          00:43:33       It's all about the w. So that changes the entertainment value. And for me that's the most important. Do you think that it should be just submission only? It either submission only or you really, really break down a point system for the way it should be and this is the way it should be. Like um, uh, in Dean listers match against, I forget who he lost it. It was so many matches but he was down on points and at the very end he puts, I think it was you Alesis he put them in a triangle. He had them in a sense triangle at the very end and he was down by two points, maybe three, I'm not sure on the points, but he was down, it was 30 seconds. Put them in a triangle and in my eyes a triangle. You should get more. Anything since like a triangle, a figure, if your legs are sense, like you have a guy in a triangle, doesn't mean he's going to tap.

Speaker 7:          00:44:29       A lot of times some guys escape. But if it's totally sent, that guy was in deep, deep trouble. If he escapes, he got lucky. So that that sense triangle should represent weigh more than a pass or a sweep. That's just common sense. So in my eyes, if you want to score, keep the scoring system and you, you're, you're in love with, you're going to commit to the scoring system. Really think about this, the score, how you score this. If a pass is three points. If a sweep is two points, uh, cinched Doris, which people escape half the time. But if you cinch it all the way up and as a referee, you should see if it's a near sub, if it's a cinch. Darce sense triangle, essential arm triangle, um, uh, straightened out arm. Like you straighten the guy's arm and he escaped by the skin of his teeth.

Speaker 7:          00:45:19       You straightened out his leg like a knee bar. He escaped by the skin of his teeth. You can see that I wouldn't count. He'll hook and toehold attempts cause then that would, you know, they're so easy to just to jump on and then it turns into just a bunch of, uh, footsies. But if you, I would count in my world, I would count straightened the bars, straight arm bars, anything sensed any kind of, um, that should be seven points. Yeah, I agree with you. Sorry. I think it should five something. It should be like football. Yeah. A pass. What is it now? It's one, do you know anything? It is not in Abu Dhabi. There's nothing watts. It means nothing. Wait a minute. It means not. That doesn't make any sense. It doesn't mean anything. So if a guy's ascension triangle, that's not an near submission.

Speaker 7:          00:46:02       That's ridiculous. Wow. You have that. Those rules are terrible. She going to be, it should be worth way more than a sweep. Uh, yeah. Without a doubt. Yeah. Sweeps. You know, people recover from sweeps. Uh, but if someone has you that close to being tapped, like a cinch to rear naked or something along those lines, that's like a goal. You make a touchdown, you got out of it. But God damn, I got to got to an incredibly dominant position. Exactly. That should be, and Naga is into evolution. And so as grapplers quest grapplers quests are doing selected super fights, submission only. So submission only is starting to spread. The Gracie nationals is submission only. Gracie world, a submission only sub league up in the Pacific northwest is a a submission only Midwest submission challenge, which are doing submission only, uh, tournaments all over the Midwest.

Speaker 7:          00:46:47       It's growing, it's growing. But if you're still committed to points, like Nog is nugget, they did change up and tweak the point system. They are getting, I think one point maybe two for a near sub, which they're on the right track. You're on the whoever's running Naga, you kip color, you're definitely on the right track. Let's turn it up a little bit more. Let's make since Darcel ascension triangles, seven points. It makes sense. That's like a touchdown, a sweep as to, yeah, no, I agree with you. We were both on the same page. So besides that, the the tournament, the Abu Dhabi ADCC is the most prestigious on the planet. If it wasn't for that tournament, I wouldn't be sitting here. That's for damn sure. It just seems like those rules are just, they need be revised. That's all. Now tell me about kron Gracie. That's what I was about to tell you.

Speaker 7:          00:47:33       You read my mind. No, I'm looking at a video of him crying. Gracie versus Gary Tonin. Gary Tonkins, a 21 year old dude who he shocked everybody that match was probably the greatest grappling match of all time. Gary tone it and crying. Gracie Kron Gracie gets his arm, straightens it out and look, he looks like he's going to break it. Alert. Well, you don't want what? You don't want to tell about it. Trust me, it doesn't even matter. He straightened his arm out. He wouldn't have, they kept rolling. Straighten his arm. Everyone's going nuts. He's real. He's real. Everywhere he rolls, the Ar Chron is right there. Every angle with the arm, totally straight. It looked like it's going to break. Everybody's going, aw, it didn't, he didn't just hold it and escape. Do they a rolling all over the place and that arm should have broke off to he survived.

Speaker 7:          00:48:26       He didn't tab gets on top, takes Crohn's back, puts him in the truck, almost has Cronin, a twister. Oh my grand spins out. He goes back to the bag, puts an Anaconda on, I'm Aka triangle body lock on them has cron face down. It looks over Hixon sitting there going, oh damn. And in the first match, that was cron second match in its first match. Crown demolished, uh, Andy when I love you Andy Wang. But he went right through him like in 30 seconds and Hixon didn't even move. He's sitting there and he went right through Andy Wang and Hixon Denny move. And I was like, we're looking at Hixson. I'm like, man, that's way doper than getting all excited him not doing anything like he expects it. It's no big deal. You, you went right through him. The best possible outcome. Hixon didn't and make a move like Yoda and I, I, I admired that.

Speaker 7:          00:49:17       I'm like, wow, that's deep right there. He's not even happy. Not even a smile, but in this match. Hickson was like visibly shaking. You could see him going, what you he's watching and where's this kid come out of? I think he's from the east coast. I'm not sure. But he was on a that Bjj Kuma Tay thing with a Heenan Cornelius who also did amazing at Abu Dhabi. But anyways, back to Guerin. Dude, there's a minute left and at this point, a minute and a half in Chron is doing everything to try and escape your, you were watching cron be defeated right now. We're watching him be defeated. After you almost had that dude's arm like five different times. [inaudible] struggling. He can't get out. Gary tones back defenses or or back control is professional assassin like chron cannot get out, but by the skin of his teeth, I have to see it again. I don't know exactly I got, but he got out, they stand up. Hixon looks at him and goes, you got one minute chron turns around to take some down, passes this guard, it takes a while. He gets his back. Dude, he's schools with two seconds left. Gary taps. Ah, it was the craziest

Speaker 4:          00:50:29       submission match I've ever seen. It's really fascinating watching crime for people who don't know his dad is the greatest Jujitsu guy of all time. There's one guy that's always thought of above all others in the world. That Jujitsu, it ticks and grace. You've got to have them on this podcast. I would love to have a bond. It would be easy. Would it be simple? He lives in Brazil now. Doesn't mean he's here, right? He, I dunno, I do. You're right. You're right. I don't know. I'll figure it out. I'll get in touch with chronic. I would fly him in first class. Last time I saw Cron, um, it was at the, when he fought Matt Hughes in La, he, uh, he had that was like, oh, seven or six. Yeah, he was a young kid. He was really young. There was right after I had, uh, I had dinner with Hixon once and I went to his house and watch fights and he broke down.

Speaker 4:          00:51:13       What people are doing wrong, dude, you know crazy. That is, you went to Hickson's house, hung out with them and watched fights, broke down fights. I remember you telling me this, you were telling me he broke down cause fade or at the, at the moment was the Mr indestructable. He was on top. Everyone feared him and wanted to fight him. Yeah. And he, yeah, he broke down how to beat fade on his mind, right? Oh yeah. Oh he thought he could be fade or he thinks he can beat anyone. He's a monster. He's a scary dude when you're, well, he's a master. He's a true master Jujitsu and he's got like that Samurai mindset. A lot of people talk that Samurai mindset. Yeah. That fucking dude lives it. Like that is his mindset. Yeah. The Gracie family is very large and there's a lot of sections, a lot of Gracie clicks.

Speaker 4:          00:51:58       There's the Carlson side, there's the car, low side, there's the helio side else inside the house, inside. Uh, and a lot of them hate each other. A lot of them talk a lot of crap on each other. Uh, but Hixon man ever. I don't know how many times I've heard people say fuck that grace a grace. He said like fuck that Gracie a Brazilian or someone from the old school like all the old school guys. But they'll, they'll never, they'll always say except Hickson, they make, they tell you except Texan like Alan goes man Alan goals. There's little, he has a lot of problems with people but he makes it clear. He goes but Hickson's awesome. Excellent cause they all say it. They all agree that although there's no roles on video, like now everyone has their roles on video. You could get them on youtube like you catch Marcello's rose all day.

Speaker 4:          00:52:47       The greatest Jujitsu player ever. But Hixon not too many roles but everyone sets all like myth. That's all legend but you got to believe it cause everyone says the same thing. Even David Camereo when he went down there and David Cameron has a worldclass black belt, he said he couldn't do anything with Exim. Yeah. Even Paulo Filo said that Paulo Filo went down there and came back and was like Jesus Christ, he's a master. He has been doing Brazilian Jiu Jitsu community. Hixon is a god. He's the best Gracie hands down. So he had two sons and one of them Hawkson, uh, died a few years

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       back and he was already on his way to being a bad ass Jujitsu player. And his youngest son Cron over the last couple of years has just become this fucking p six and son. And I remember when he was 12, outside of a Jujitsu tournament, some Ibj JF tournament and Domingo State Hills here in California. Uh, me and John Jock, my master John Jacques Machado, we were outside. He was basically giving me a sermon like he always does and like everything that comes out of his mouth as Gospel and everything's perfect and he just has, he's like a superhero and we're walking outside and Crohn's 12 at this time and he's messing around on a skateboard, jumping up, doing the score skateboard tricks. And John John, John Jack looks over at him and says, that's the one right there. I tell you, that is the one he's going to be unstoppable. I'll never forget that. He called it out and John's talk also, he's called out a lot of people who you thought were going to be legends and John Jack said he doesn't have what it takes.

Speaker 3:          00:54:24       He's going to break. And I'm like, no way. John Jock. He's like, watch him break. He's going to break. And Damn, he was right. And there was a couple that he called out that broke and they just disappeared and see things. Sean Shock. It really is Yoda. And he, he uh, called out cron. He knew it and [inaudible] he's, he is now in a select group that man, I don't know if there's more than three or four, but he submitted everybody in his weight division. He tapped everybody out. And here's another Hixon store. Oh, well, John Jacques Machado was the first the tap everyone out back in [inaudible] 99 or 2000, one of those, Abu Dhabi's 98 99 John Jacques Machado shows up to Abu Dhabi. He's the first superstar. Back then everyone was having trouble with the submissions. A lot of the key champions. We're having a little trouble submitting dudes without the g and the wrestlers.

Speaker 3:          00:55:16       They didn't want to pass the guard or someone, anybody, but they could throw you around and you ain't taking them down. So a lot of, lot of boring matches in the early Abu Dhabi and that's why the sheet kept changing the rules, trying to, trying to work, work it all out. But uh, then the next God who came and just submit it, everybody in 2003 was Marcello Garcia. He was the second coming of John Shock. First I was John, John Marcella Garcia and now, you know, there've been other guys that have uh, have a bunch of submissions and I would, I be to high grace. He's done a tremendous job. So many good guys out there. But as far as coming in and just submitting everybody in your division, maybe Haji did it too, I don't know. But Kron Gracie did it last weekend. He went through everybody and you know, the Gary Tone and fight, that was a close one, man. He escaped by the skin of his teeth. But that showed how awesome he is and, and how we can come back. And in the final, you know, first we have Hickson, the first, first couple of matches, he's just real chill zen. And then when he beat Gary Tone and you see Hicks and jumping up chronos. Yeah, I'd never seen Hixon so happy he was trying to get him from the or without actually

Speaker 5:          00:56:24       he was trying to get the twister before he even got the lockdown on the back leg. He was like, he was thinking about it early. He was thinking about putting like as yeah. As the body triangles wrapped around them. He's thinking of grabbing a snack. Yeah. Yeah. Where's this kid Trina?

Speaker 7:          00:56:40       Gary Talon. And Look, I'm a t. O. N. O. N. Do that transition where you took Crohn's back is insane. And not only, you know what Gary and did, he ended up doing the absolute and the first round he went against the butcher, which whose who won the heavyweight division who is considered the best new heavyweight dude moves like a panther blue Shasha is, I think his name is Marco Elmeda. Man. You know, some of these Brazilians, I know them by their nickname, but the real name is, is uh, it's hard to remember sometimes, but boot will Shasha he, he wins his head, the heavyweight division. Now he signs up for the absolute first round. It's Gary Tonin who's 170 pounds against Boucher who just won the heavy heavy weight. That's the worst possible drop. The smallest guy gets the biggest guy and you know what Boucher can tap him. It was a good match, which just I got all sorts of position on him but Gary kept recovery and Gary kept attacking and this will, he loses that right on point but he didn't get put put, put away.

Speaker 7:          00:57:42       And um, uh, the guy was talking about earlier, Jared dop, the guy who beat him here, he ended up beating your mirror. We were like, fuck man, we got an unknown. It was perfect. We should have beat. This guy was a close match. A Amir had his back for a second but didn't get points. He had them in a Kamora didn't get points for any of that and the guy took him down once it passes guard and I'm, you're lost on points and, and it was kind of a shocker. I was the first round, like, damn, we, who is, we got a guy, a guy that no one knows that we should have beat him. Damn. Then he gets a Vinnie Maga last, the next round. Jared. Dot. He Beats Vinny. Whoa. So then we're like thinking any lost Vinny got beat by the guy that beat a Amir. Why do you think that's because Vinny, he's doing so much. I'm a man. I'm just not doing, Vinny was not in shape for this. Vinny, he, he admitted it to me. He didn't train very much at all. He just couldn't turn it down. You know? I'm sure it had a lot to do with him getting cut by the UFC and not really fucked with his mind for awhile and last fire was hard. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:58:43       Yeah. Knocked out like what's the first punch that a homeboy through and he never expected that he fought. Um, uh, Australian gentlemen. The fuck's his name? Uh, Anthony. Yeah. Anthony [inaudible], who's a black belt in Jujitsu. And that's what a lot of people expected. They thought it was going to be a, a Jujitsu versus Jujitsu Bell. And he caught Vinnie like with the first one

Speaker 7:          00:59:06       he got, he gets cut. He's in a depressive state. He's not really training hard for Abu Dhabi. And Jared dop beat him. He's from Rafael Lovato is camp. He's a purple belt. That's incredible. Yeah. So he's just incredible specimen. So he gets Cyborg next. He gets Cyborg next and he is winning. He's beating him all. He's gotta do a survive for 30 more seconds. He would have beat Amir Olam, the top 10 planet heavyweight, uh, Vinnie, Michael [inaudible] who won the gold medal in the APIs absolute in 2011. And then Cyborg. He was going to be Cyborg. He wouldn't, but at the very end, cyborg pulled it off and he impressed the shit out of me. And cyborg ended up winning. Uh, he ended up getting third in his weight, Boucher one, and in the absolute Cyborg took it all. He beat Boucher, shot in the finals. It was PR.

Speaker 7:          00:59:57       I mean, what did Cyborg catch him with? He'd beat him on points. I'll catch you if not, it's just points site. So he was losing it until the last few minutes of Jared. Dot was beating him on points. And then I forget how it went down again. There was a 50 batches, but so all I remember Cyborg came back at the very end. The Gero dop couldn't hold up. He had it, he just could hold on it and Cyborg pulled it out of his ass, got some points. I think he took his back or something, got some, some, some good points and barely pulled it off. He was, he's, I mean, and then Jared dop did the absolute and he beats his first guy and maybe a second guy. Then he gets hurt. He asked the bowel out his shoulder shirt. He was gonna get a rematch with Cyborg in the absolutes.

Speaker 7:          01:00:41       But you know, since he couldn't go, Gary Tone in one 70 pounder who'd lost against Boucher, who, who gave him a gay a great match. They call him and go, dude, you're in. And he's like, Oh shit. So now he's going to get Cyborg 240 pounds of pure leopard. You know what I mean? And like tiger and he's built like a brick shit house. Oh yeah. It was videos of him training strength and conditioning online pushing shit shit. And you know what he Gary tone and look great man. He was given Cyborg fits. That is going to be a superstar. My words. Yes. Just remember Gary Tonin [inaudible] that big and he's given, it must be, how young is this kid? 21 strong shit. That's amazing. Yeah. He's not even a big guy. And I looked at the video of him crying. He says, Dude, looks at a normal size guy.

Speaker 7:          01:01:31       He's out of control and he plays his, his best shit is a part of the same style that I play. Gary Teton and plays a lot of prison guard. I don't know if he calls a prison guard, that's just what I named it. But it's, it's like, uh, uh, a head and arm from the bottom. It's basically a Greco Roman full guard game. That's what an, I call it prison guard. There was nothing brown belt. Yeah, yeah. Crazy. Yeah. And Oh, the way he got Crohn's back, the way he got it was through prison guard. And again, it's, it's not, uh, something that I'm sure he names it, but it's something that I named and it's a head and arm from the top, from the bottom, and you squeeze on it and just shuck that arm that's caught, uh, in between your arm. Just shuck it over your head. You've got to get really good at that. And you get, you can go right to the back

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       or you could transition to swim, move to spiderweb, or if you can't shut the arm over your head, you could transition right into rubber guard beautifully. Or You could put the Pharcyde butterflying in and get some sweeps. So it's a very, very strong position. The actual position, uh, the whole style I call prison guard, but the actual positions called homie control and homey control is the mission control of prison guards. So I play it all the time, all the time. And, uh, watching Gary Tonin go to it over and over, did it to Cyborg. He would decide it was too big. It didn't really work on him. And then he did it on a Bouchet shock. He kept trying. I'm like, I dunno, prison guard is going to work on a guy that has a hundred pounds on you or something. But, uh, he kept going to it.

Speaker 3:          01:03:02       So I look out for Gary Tonin. Yeah. It sounds like kids a beast. I love that. I love with all these new dudes are just coming up out of nowhere. Yeah. That's one of the cool things about Jujitsu is that there's so many guys out there practicing it now. Yeah. I think someone, it's about time for someone to put it on TV. I think one of these days they're going to figure out a format or the guys are going to get talented enough or scary enough where you're going to be able to put it on TV. And it'll be something that I think about that all the time. And I've had a invest, I've have a show that, uh, it's, it's a concept. Uh, we had financial backers that were interested and then they back out. We had a couple of other more than we're interested in, they back out there, I'm not sure, but the whole goal of mine with this show is a 16 man tournament.

Speaker 3:          01:03:47       The whole goal is entertainment value and everything is designed to score. It's a, it's a submission only format. There's a few different ways you can go with submission only, but the way everything in my mind was all designed to create urgency for this submission. Like the, the, like for example, the ultimate urgency would be you do a submission only match between two guys and the winner gets $1 billion. The loser gets nothing. You imagined urgency of that and how exciting that would be. Obviously you don't really mean $1 billion, but I'm just saying I'm just, that's an example. If you could give them a billion, that'd be great. But let's say realistically in 50 years, a hundred years, two years Jujitsu's mainstream. There's like some reality show about Jujitsu and it gets so big and people love it. But we, we, we have to figure out the right format first to to make sure that there's a lot of excitement because right now, you know, you got to Jujitsu tournaments, there's nobody there.

Speaker 3:          01:04:41       The only people in the stands or the actual competitors and their girlfriends and maybe their moms. It, we've been having these world championships forever. Nobody's going to see it cause the point system is developed to, uh, satisfy the competitor. Well, it's a little bit of that, but it's also the, just, it hasn't been introduced, right? Yeah. It hasn't been introduced at all. You know, now that a spike is starting to put glory on the highest level kickboxing, they're putting that on TV. I think one of these days someone's going to realize that he watched like that Kron Gracie, Gary Cohn and fight that kind of a match. It's very exciting. Let's say that, okay. Realistically, 50 years or whatever, Jujitsu is mainstream. You could

Speaker 7:          01:05:18       do a show where there's a 16 man tournament submission only and the winner one winner only. It's just like a any kind of reality show. One winner gets $100,000 cash or whatever. That's Matt. That unrealistic. Can you imagine the excitement of those matches? You have a good match maker you put together, you know you don't just throw people together but the x, the amount of urgency that there is going to be for the submission, the training would be totally different. People would be specifically training their setups to the submissions. It would be all about the submission. Right now these guys getting the w and winning by points is all that's necessary. So guys are specifically training for to for the point system. And I'm guilty of it too. I mean, I mean if that's, if that's the format. This is how I understand cause I do the same thing with Amir alum.

Speaker 7:          01:06:09       He wrestled his whole life. He's one of my brown belts, but he's a wrestler through and through. So we were going to go in and just say you're a wrestler. He worked on his wrestling. Let's beat these guys by the point system. Let's get that w I was doing that. I'm not like this. You know, you're forced to think like that based on the system because you want the w so bad. So I'm guilty of it too. We were, we were, we wanted to wrestle Jared. Dot. So, you know, you, uh, you make it a 16 man tournament, eight man terminate. You make it a reality show submission. Only one guy gets $100,000. I'm going to do, did it. But I do, you know, if he did a million that would even be crazier. The matches would be nuts. All you'd have to do is just have guys who are really good, who are going for submissions and going after it.

Speaker 7:          01:06:51       And you would, it'd be a really exciting sport. A lot more excited than a lot of shit that is on, on TV and just people just don't know about, they're just not used to it. Yeah. It can be done. Someone just like someone like to shake, you know, figuring out how to do it. Yeah. You know, it's, it's uh, you know, and there's a lot of people that get, they look into Jujitsu and then they watch a match and go, fuck this, this is boring. They're just the way the gay sport is turning into now. It's like I'm a black belt in the g and I look at the new stuff. I don't even know who's on top. I have no idea who's winning that plan. Tug of war with the pants and they're in this mangled, tangled position that I wouldn't even know who has the advantage.

Speaker 7:          01:07:26       Someone got an advantage very near sweep. I who did, I'm considered one of the things I wanted to ask you about cron. He doesn't do any new shit. Like everything he does is old school, Jujitsu, old school, Hixon Gracie style, the, the, you know that, that real basic set of techniques and just it just get some laser sharp. That's all he does. He has a incredible rear naked choke and even more insane guillotine in the final, he went against Oto Tavio Sousa. He's one of the top Gracie Baha guy at that weight at one 70. And Oh, getting to this match. Right. So it's the finals Hixon Gracie sitting there or on an o Tavio they're going at it. Oh. Tibio decides to get inside crimes head. And the way he's going to do that is keep staying away from them, not engage, slap him on the neck, push him away.

Speaker 7:          01:08:23       Frustrate. Because all cron wants a submission. Right? He's like Marcella Garcia, he just goes forward. The submission is on Crohn's. Mine, right. You know, for damn sure. That's what he wants. And uh, he kept going forward. Oh, Teva keeps pushing away him. He's a bad motherfucker. He got pushed. He beat Leo Vr. I mean he's, he's legit. One of the best. And he actually, they weren't against each other and metamorris and Chron beat him in the Geeky armbar them. It was a, it was an epic match and the match before that at the world. Octavio one. So metamorris was a rematch. He got revenge. Now the rubber match in Abu Dhabi, in the vinyl, he smacking his head and conflict and over at the ref gone. You know, what does he doing? Just smacking my neck. And he keeps walking backwards. I understood what I'll Tavia was doing.

Speaker 7:          01:09:06       He was trying to frustrate them, get inside of Santa. It was working. He was getting pissed off. But you know what it was also working on Hixon to soon said, hey, uh, and this is according, I didn't hear it personally, but this is according to what I heard, the reports, the reporters, it's all over the Internet. So I may be wrong, but it appears to be correct based on the reports I read that Hickson was, at first he was like telling the ref. He keeps, he keeps going backwards. He's not engaged and it keeps going backwards. He's, he doesn't even want to fight. And then he said, he's chicken, he's chicken. And then he starts making chicken noises. He said, but God, bring up, bring up. You'll imagine doing that. Isn't that crazy? You know what that tells you, man? You know, there's some people out there that don't understand that.

Speaker 7:          01:09:50       But as a father, I, I understand it. If I do, it's like you're, that's your son. You're going to make sure I got my son murdered somebody. I'm going to shelter him, I'm going to hide him. You know what I'm saying? I shouldn't talk about it. Know what I'm saying is know what I'm saying is you'll do anything for your kids and what you're seeing even doing, making chicken noises that they could easily make you seem like you're childish. Easy, but he don't care. All they care is about macho. He was willing to do anything it took to make Octavio engage and it worked. He engaged, took a shot, chron guillotine them the fastest guillotine ever soon as he took him down, cross sat down. Boom. It was over. Man. I don't know if it's online, but it was over like in three seconds or less. Less than three seconds. Boom. He won the world championship. Submitted everybody.

Speaker 5:          01:10:43       That's amazing. It's just amazing when you hear about a guy who is the son of the great master, like the greatest master ever. It's almost like a movie, you know? And when he was young, you know, like I remember hanging out with him over at Hickson's house. You know, she's just like a young kid. He was talking about rap music and shit. And of course he trained Jujitsu. He loved Jiu Jitsu. He loved the fact that his dad was this, you know, I mean imagine if that's your dad. He's just the greatest Jujitsu guy of all time. He's got to be the coolest shit ever. And he's right. He's currently the baddest guy in Abu Dhabi for, it's amazing. And he's young too. And you know what, no homo or anything. But that guy's a, he's a beautiful man. Was Wife was beautiful. He in his wife, she's beautiful Hicks.

Speaker 5:          01:11:26       It's beautiful. Yeah. Hixon married some supermodel back in the day and they had a bunch of kids and all their kids, even hawkson and their daughters, they all have perfect little model faces and their Tam, he, he could easily be a movie star there. Their models is kids like amber Abercrombie and Fitch model so well when he was in that, that documentary choke, if that documentary, it's really unfortunate that that didn't become a huge documentary cause even people who don't appreciate martial arts, you just want to watch something interesting. Like people keep telling me about the Sushi documentary, Gen zero genes of Sushi or whatever the fuck it's called. It's supposed to be amazing about a guy who was like really into Sushi. But I'm not in the Sushi. I'm not an about giant to be a Sushi chef. I hate it. But if you, even if you have no aspirations towards martial arts, choke is an amazing documentary because it follows this guy who's just, he's just the, he's legit. He's legit, masterful in everything he does. I mean, they do it as a, he's meditating in the fucking freezing icy rivers of Japan. He gets under water up to his neck and he's, you know, he's, he's doing his meditation, practicing and doing yoga, where does this weird shit with his stomach. And yeah, it's cool when a guy like that exists, when there really is a bad motherfucker, like a real, like mystical sort of a showman Brazilian jujitsu master who's better than everybody else. And that reminds me of the most surreal

Speaker 3:          01:12:55       moment of my Jujitsu career. Man Was Abu Dhabi at the first way and hits and comes up to me and says, Hey Heddy, how are you doing? I shook my hand, my head almost exploded. I couldn't believe him saying Eddie. Yeah, very strange. It was that he knew who you were because you know, Cron Cron and John John are real tight. John Joc is now a coral belt under Hixon Gracie. So Hixon Gracie is John jocks master now. And uh, he used to be Gracie Baha and under Carlinos and on him, but now he's, he's under Hickson and John [inaudible] always been tight with crowd. That's how he had that insight. That's how he knew he was going to be a champion, the champion that he is. So John, Jack Brock Cron over to my gym maybe two weeks ago. And that was the first time ever got to hang out with chron and train with them. And it was, it was pretty amazing to have Hixon son that. And anytime I have a Gracie there with me that I could talk to, my always, I always want to remind them that there's a big misconception about what 10 plan of Jujitsu is all about. And to someone who really doesn't know and hasn't done the research, it's easy to, it's easy to kind of see that, oh, uh, or easy to believe that I say turned

Speaker 7:          01:14:12       my back on Jujitsu. Once I got my black belt, I threw the Goa, I'm disrespectful to them,

Speaker 1:          01:14:17       understands this if they don't follow Jiu Jitsu, but there's two camps of Jujitsu. There's people who train with a Geek, you know, big bulky Kimono thing and there's no g, which is mostly guys where rash guards or shorts and their training basically techniques that would work in mixed martial arts because of the fact that the gooey is this big piece of cloth. People grab it and hold onto it and it, it really changes the entire nature of, of grappling changes everything. Because if all you have all these handles that you can hold onto, it becomes really annoying.

Speaker 7:          01:14:49       Yeah. And a majority of the Brazilian Jujitsu a community, they really liked the ghee. And I understand that it's like liking long in your surfer and some people like short boards. No Nogi would be like the short board and Longboard we'd like the key. It's really traditional. It looks cool. You grow up and you see these karate movies and you want to wear that gain. You strap that black belt on and you've got to key, you feel like a superhero because that black belt is real. I get it. I understand. But um, I got into Jujitsu because of the UFC. I became a fanatic of the UFC and Jujitsu is the closest thing I could do to be kind of close to the sport and understand the sport without getting hit in the face. I don't like boxing. I don't like kickbox and I don't want to get hit.

Speaker 7:          01:15:33       But Jujitsu is awesome. It's safe, you know, all you're doing is practicing strangling each other and getting really good at that and practicing breaking limbs. Like who doesn't want to learn that? Anybody can learn that and you and you don't get hurt. No one's punching you. I was sold right when I saw the UFC. It was oh a way for me to be the be close to the UFC, the sport that I worship now. Um, so when I see a Jujitsu black belts in the UFC, great with the g, but all of a sudden they're fighting in the UFC without a, and now they don't have their handles and do, they're trying to punch them and their elbows and all that stuff. To me, I thought the [inaudible] was the prompt. Jujitsu wasn't looking that good. And the UFC man and those dark ages like UFC 17 to ou like that.

Speaker 7:          01:16:17       Even today, overall, the Jujitsu I think could be a lot better if they, if everyone's focused on Jujitsu techniques that worked when specifically when dudes to trying to punch you or elbow EU and you know, and there's no handles, it's different. So anyways, so I was, I loved Jujitsu so much that I was tired of being let down by never seen. You rarely see sweeps in the UFC. You go to a Jujitsu class or Jujitsu tournament where they're wearing a g, you see sweeps and submissions for off your back from the guard when you're on your back all the time. But why weren't you seeing it in the UFC? I go, you rarely see sweeps. And even today when you see a good quality sweep, it's woo. It's a highlight reel. That was an amazing sweet. But in the ghee that happened all the time and submissions off the back happen all the time. So the differences, it's just common sense in the gay, you don't have to worry about dude's elbowing you and you've got all these handles and you

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       develop all these techniques based on pulling the collar and holding on the sleeve. And that becomes your fighting stance. And when, if that's your fighting stance and all of a sudden you do MMA and there's no fat, the fat fighting style is totally different. You're clenching now cause you don't want to get knocked out. You got to focus on that. So for me, I thought, man, if I ever opened up a school, I'm when I'm, I never liked the gate to begin with. Personal personally, I'd rather train Gnocchi. It's faster. I like it faster. I have no problems with the gay. A lot of my students, they'll try in the geek personally, it's just too slow for me. I needed to be faster. So when I have, uh, um, so a lot of people in the Jiu Jitsu community think that I turned my back on Jujitsu.

Speaker 3:          01:17:49       Man, nothing could be further from the truth, I don't think any, no, no. It was just a bunch of haters out there and there's people that hate no matter what, but there's no one to focus on them. No, I just, I just wanted to make it clear. And when Chron came to my school two weeks ago, I made it clear to him like, I just want to let you know that I have all the respect in the world for the Gracies. Anybody that thinks I don't is ridiculous. I mean, in my first book that came out in 2005, it opens up with a paragraph or two on each Gracie and thanking them for, for creating me and creating the sport and the UFC. So it, and that's over, that's like 10 years ago. It's not anything that I'm trying to, I'm trying to do damage control now or anything, so I just wanted to put that out there that, that uh, um, you don't have to put that up there and nobody believes that.

Speaker 3:          01:18:34       Hey. Um, would you think about the UFC this weekend? Incredible. Those are the craziest UFC ever. Yeah, it was going on right when I would have, it was going on. It was going on at a Saturday or Sunday morning. Was it Sunday morning and it was Saturday morning here or something like that. It was like, it was weird. So I didn't get to see it live and I don't think it was possible to see it live. We ended up seeing it the next day. Uh, Amir and Scott Palmer, another one of my students who went, they figured out how to find it somewhere online.

Speaker 5:          01:19:05       Online. Yeah. Yeah. The Diego Sanchez, Gilbert Melendez fire was the craziest fucking thing I've ever seen in my life. Yeah, it was madness. Especially that third round. God Damn, that was incredible. They just went off. They just went after it in a way like you very rarely see and for Diego to drop Gilbert Melendez without uppercut after all that damage he was taken. Yeah, man. There we saw some serious heart that night. I mean junior dos Santos that talk about heart. Jesus Christ. Yeah. Dee Diego Sanchez is a special dude. He's his belief in himself and his, his ability to absorb punishment. It's crazy battles. He's bites down his mouthpiece and he doesn't do a lot of slipping and moving, you know? He's taken a lot of them and just charge and forward. He loves it. He's so crazy. He had a giant cut over his iron man. It was bigger than his eyebrow.

Speaker 5:          01:19:56       It was like the size of his eyebrow was enormous. Yeah. There was a, there was a whole wild fucking event. Did you see Hector Lombard and Nate Marquardt? Yes. Holy Shit. I won 70 hectare. Lumbar going to give, he'll give anybody fits. I could see him. He can be the champ. Yeah, easily. Easily. Yeah. Yeah. He's terrifying at one 70 he's a freak athlete, man. Would GSP be able to take him down? I don't know man. I don't know. He's a freak athlete. Well now I use that term a lot freak athlete. But Hector Lombard really is a freak and at one 70 that might be the strongest one 70 that's ever existed ever. He hits so fucking hard dude. He chased down Nate Marquardt who was a strike force former champion. Okay. Nate mark, what was the Strikeforce welterweight champion and Hector lumbar chased him around like he was some kid that he was going to assault.

Speaker 5:          01:20:45       I mean it was, it was amazing. I mean he like almost like he had no worry whatsoever about Nate Marquardt techniques. Just ran after him, ran after him, kept throwing bombs at them. And then the last shocks amount last shot. Did you see what it did to Nate's body? Yeah. It made him kind of like hop and land on his, but I can see his leg slipped out from under him when he, cause he was like kind of running away and he got one of those uppercuts from behind and then boom, it lifted him up and he landed right on his bud was pretty crazy. It was horrific. Yeah. He fucked him up, man. It was, it was spooky. I didn't know that he was going to be able to do that. I mean, I knew that he, Jake, Jake Ellenberger and Nate Marquardt had a, uh, a real tough fight and Nate got knocked out, but they were going after each other, you know?

Speaker 5:          01:21:32       I mean, Nate was going after him too. It was a real, it was, he got caught with a big shot by Ellenberger and Ellenberger can take anybody out. But it was competitive up until that, this was not competitive. This was a mugging. I mean, he just came after Nate Marquardt, Nate Marquardt try to counter him a couple of times at right hands. But mostly it was just trying to get the fuck out of the way. And that dude just came at him like, oh, like a monster. It was weird. It was. He's ridiculously strong. Yeah. Is it's scary dude. At 170 pounds. I want immediately to see matches with him against like Carlos condit immediately to see him. He him against guys like Johnny Hendricks or George see AP or whoever wins the title. According to Eric Paulson, I had him on my podcast. He's telling me some Hector Lombard stories.

Speaker 5:          01:22:18       Man, the guy is intense, 24 seven in the gym, wants to throw down him and Josh Barnett. Throat threw down at least once. Yeah. Josh told me about Josh. Josh mounted him and would never let them up. We just beating on him. He wouldn't let him up as apparently he had an issue with something lumbar. Did someone else in the gym, so Josh and him just went after it. Josh said the guy's a freak athlete. He said he does those muscle ups, you know those things where you do a chin up and then you push up from the top. They're really hard to do. This is a motherfucker just, he'd never done it before. I banged out like 10 in a row. Boom, boom. I don't think I'll ever be able to do one. He's a freak athlete. Like when you look at his body, he's five foot seven and five foot seven wide. You know, he's so big. Mimi's probably probably about five nine they probably a little taller than me think. I Dunno my hydro five maybe my either my height or maybe slightly taller. I'm five eight but he's twice as wide as man. I mean he might, he might and I'm pretty wide. You might be like literally a foot wider than me.

Speaker 3:          01:23:20       Yeah, he, I think it's an illusion. He's actually, he might be five 10 but he says last are so wide and the shoulders that it appears that he's five fours, he's so wide.

Speaker 5:          01:23:30       I've never seen a dude his height that wide before and the power that motherfucker has, God damn, it's scary. Scary and just ultimate confidence in his ability to knock guys out. Ultimate confidence. Like as he charged in on Nate, it was just, he knew it was a matter of time. It was weird. It was weird to watch. I never thought I'd watched Nate get steam steamrolled like that. You know, you think about Nate. Nate fought Anderson Silva. It was a decent fight until Anderson a reversed him on the ground and beat him up and stopped him. But it was a decent fight before that. Nate fought Tyron Woodley and knocked him out. I mean, Nate is a bad motherfucker. He's a really good fighter. You don't think of all the guys he's knocked out. He knocked out Martin and Martin Kampmann, you know named mark. No fucking joke.

Speaker 5:          01:24:14       He's been around a long ass time too. He's really fucking gold bar. It's got that Hendricks power. Just boom. But he's got in both hands. Yeah. He's this terrifying, terrifying Lombard's. Terrifying. He might be the motherfucker at one 70 men. It really might be. Yes, it might be. So these guys, man, sometimes it's just a matter of making that weight. Getting minding the weight class. Yeah. Look at Damien Maia at one seven eight. Yeah, no, but then Jake shields beat him, which is crazy. I could have went either way. Yeah, it was a, it was a, I think one of those fights that easily could be a draw. You can decide who wins, but my, it didn't happen. You know, that a lot of people were saying to mio is, was going to dominate him the way he dominated Rick story. Yeah, yeah. No. If people forget how good a Rambo Jake shields. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:24:56       yeah. He never really got close to any submissions. And the, the, and Jake, he's probably top three if not the best passer in MMA. His passing, his incredible, him and Sean sherk incredible passing and Jake almost passed so many times, God. And to have that kind of confidence that tried to pass Maya's guard, most receptors we'll just say, okay, in this fight or you get on top, don't even try to pass. But Jake kept trying to pass and even though even though he, he didn't quite make it, it was very impressive that he had the confidence to keep pushing and keep trying to pass. And Damen Meier really can do anything off his back against Jake. Jake's Easter, having guys attack them, you know, serious guys off their back. So man, that was a very, very close fight. I thought they would give it to Maya base because it was in Brazil. I thought Jake's really gonna have to beat him. He's decisively to get it in Brazil. But, uh, that wasn't the case after all. So congratulations to Jake.

Speaker 5:          01:25:56       Yeah, that was a big win for him. Cause Maya was on the verge of a title shot after the Rick Story fight. If they're beaten, John Fitch, he, John Fitch, John Fitch, and then, uh, beat Rick story like that. A lot of people like Jesus Christ. This guy might be the best grappler in the division. No one can stop him. So Jake wins that fight, derails his title, hopes that this is just so many good fighters now, man, it's crazy. Robbie Lawler is about the fight. Rory Macdonald. How fucking crazy is that fight? Can at the Wahhabi, Laura at one 70. And this is another one at once 70. It's fucking terrifying. He's absolutely terrified. What 70 did you see? Um, uh, Ama golf and, uh, Tj walberger. Robbie Lawler knocked out. I'm a God with a flying knee. That's how scary Robbie Lawler, I'll never forget Dana white at the comedy store years ago, telling you about Robbie Lawler for the first time it was, I got this kid, Robbie Lawler bad knock you out with both hands.

Speaker 5:          01:26:52       I remember hearing that and then he brought him up. He did well in the beginning and then he started fighting for Strikeforce. He was fighting an 85 you shouldn't have been fighting in 85 we should have been funny at one 70 and the whole time. But he also needed to mature, come into his own, you know, he's like 30 now and now he's like a real legit professional, you know, he, he, he fights smart. He doesn't just wing punches a guys, but it does still wing punches that guys, he's got a serious fucking Chin and he goes after guys. Does that fight? That's November. That's the George Saint Pierre undercard.

Speaker 5:          01:27:29       Good googly Mowgli, dude. Roy MacDonald and, and and I mean, think about that camp that Tristar camp, Brian McDonald GSP. He got so many good guys out of that. Can't that Francis car, Hmong guy. But Robbie Lawler is a mother fucker. I don't know who's gonna win that fight. He's like, super technical. Doesn't take too many chances. Works on that Long Jab, you know? But Robbie Lawler, we'll go after a motherfucker. Yeah, he spooky. What'd you think of Roy Nelson core? Me a Carmine's a fucking sick athlete, man. He's a sick, you're going to two oh five yeah, he's going, he went to fight. Jon Jones was saying it. He was saying, I'm going into a five. Yeah, he'll be at two oh five he was two 24 for this fight. You know, he'll, he'll go down to a five and he's going to be a handful for everybody. He's that elite Olympic gold medalist, caliber athlete.

Speaker 5:          01:28:21       Those motherfuckers are rare dudes. You know those dudes, they break their hand and keep punching you with it until it falls apart. He was thrilled. His throwing punches at Josh Barnett with a broken hand. You know, he's taking Josh Barnett up in the air with a broken hand slamming on the ground with, you know, he's fucking bones are rattling against themselves inside of his hand to do that. To Josh Barnett, man. Exactly. That's what I just had to be out of this world and he's not even a legit heavyweight. He wrestled at two oh six I think he wrestled it to a six it was definitely light because he had a cut weight to do it and that's why he lost his bid at the Olympics because he had kidney failure because he tried to make the weight. We try to cut the way, like cut a lot of weight and he fucked himself up. A lot of guys have that man, you know, I'm

Speaker 4:          01:29:02       Josie Aldo has kidney stones now. Had a kidney stone removed after his fight with the Korean Zombie. That's from cutting weight. Yeah. One of my students had kidney stones and and since, since he went to the hospital, went through all the excruciating pain and me hearing the stories, he said, bro, drink cranberry juice. Pure cranberry juice. Don't drink that cocktail every day. You do not want to go through what I went through. I swear to God, I have pure cranberry juice in my refrigerator. I make sure my wife keeps it stocked and I drink it every day. Just hearing his story of excruciating pain and the hospital does this guy. Who Was it? Which guy? Um, I don't know. I don't want to say is does he cut weight? He, yes. He cuts massive white. Shut it down. Yeah, he sure is. He's, is it cut weight to, to do matches?

Speaker 4:          01:29:54       Yeah. Fuck man, that Shit's bad for you. Cutting weight is not good, but if you want to be a great fighter and just drink pure Granbury cranberry juice, not the cocktail. And you should be fine every day. It tastes like shit. Tastes sour, but it's like a shot at drink it every day. Get it to make it whole foods. You can get it at a, anyway, any supermarket and it's a cranberry pills. That's a, does the same thing. Does it do this? Just take a shot. A shot of cramp. How could it do the same thing though? It never does. You know, like you take those like, um, pills, green pills, they're never as good as it was. Like real we to choose. It's kind of sour, but you get used to it. It's actually not bad and you can't drink that much of it. So it's perfect.

Speaker 4:          01:30:36       It's like a way to quench your thirst and you're not going to down like half the bottle. If it was grape drink or something, shit, you kill half the bottle. But since it's so tart, you're forced to only take a sip. And so that, what does that do? What? What's in it that protects your deck? It's gotta be the acid in it cause it's kind of sour. It's gotta be has something to do with that and making sure that those stones are always broken down. It's probably just melt some or something. I don't know. I stayed this girl who used to get 'em urinary tract infections. She seems to have to drink cranberry juice to get rid of it. How weird is that? Cranberry juice is legit. It's weird that there's foods though that cure things, you know, like do you have any stomach ailments and think bothering your stomach?

Speaker 4:          01:31:18       Take garlic. It's incredible. Like, if you, if you eat some bad food and get some sort of stomach like food poising shit like that, eat some cloves of garlic. It's like sending in rabid Italian troops to go down in there and just fuck off all the bacteria. It's incredible. And people who don't like raw garlic, you don't know what you're missing. Just eat cloves of that shit. That's fantastic for you. It's like an assault on all the shitty things inside your body. How about that Tony Ferguson? Marce Damn. Why is it called a Mars? Well, you know, cause you, you, you got a name every move and every position and every transition in my opinion to in order to teach at the highest level. So there's a difference between getting

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       a dark when you're on top and you're using your weight. He wasn't on top. He cinched it in and went to his back and mark laymen, he's a very well known MMA jujitsu coach. Uh, he used to do that. He's the one who actually called it the doors when it was named after the first guy he saw use it. Joe, Doris, and I think his name is DRC. That's, that's who mark layman is very similar to me as we'd like to name everything that doesn't have names and lots of Jujitsu moves didn't, so you got a name, there's a difference between the marks cause the Marsis on your back. And that's how he used to do it. He, he said that was his thing that he did. His squeeze was so tight that he didn't need to be on top and he'd like rolling guys and they didn't expect it.

Speaker 3:          01:32:44       And so he called it the marsh. There's also off a force, which I don't know if a guy named Freddy made it up. I don't know the story behind farce, but that's when you're kind of mounting the guy and you have, you are mounting the guy in the habit doors. So there's, there's a different variations of it and the one that Tony Transit, 10th planet, Costa Mesa all week and every Thursday he comes up and trains with me. And that's the move you got to watch when you're on with Tony. He does flying darcis man, he's, he's, I mean his, his Jujitsu is very underrated man. He's going to shock a lot of people over the, over the his career.

Speaker 5:          01:33:20       Well that Darcy did, he hit that dude with, he immediately scooted under him and then almost like an inverted crucifix and ties his arm up with his legs from the bottom

Speaker 3:          01:33:29       as that confidence in your squeeze to do that. Yeah. So that tells you a lot. Yeah. Wow. You don't ever see anybody going to the Mars. You see people going to the Darce and if the guy on the bottom roles you should be able to roll with them even if it turns into a Mars still finish it. But you don't go there voluntarily unless you have your super confident with them.

Speaker 5:          01:33:50       Having those long arms is such a massive advantage. It really is. Yeah. As far as like that leverage that you can get with long limbs, it's really incredible. Guys who have like wicked Darcy's and have long arms, they can just like shove them under platelet Kendall Grove. Kendall Grove used to catch them and all sorts of weird spots cause he could just, he had like an extra foot on his arms. Yup. Jeff Glover is, well he's one of the best at Darcy's. Jeff Glover lets you pass him. I love that move where he lets you get into side control and you think you're going to assign control but really just go into Darcel land. It just catches it in. The transition is Jujitsu for people don't know. It's so fucking technical. There's so many techniques. I mean it's, it's truly amazing when you stop and consider the positions, the amount of different possibilities each position holds and then different ways to submit people and are they all flow together?

Speaker 5:          01:34:43       If you've never done it before, it's hard to kind of understand it. And I know that's one of the things that I, I take a lot of time on when it comes to uh, uh, ground battle in the UFC. I always make sure I try to explain what a guy is trying to do, where it becomes a, where he's, you know, where he's going to and people get a chance to see it more that way. But unless you train yourself, you'll never really truly understand the beauty of it. If you train yourself, you'll get a sense of what it's like to struggle to actually catch a guy in a position. Then you'll understand how amazing it is when you see like really, really high level stuff. When you see a mad scramble at Kron Gracie and uh, Gary Tona and Gary taken Crohn's back and that wild scramble, they kept rolling, Kep Rolling, kept rolling that Pam locks up the body triangle like, fuck.

Speaker 3:          01:35:28       Yeah, yeah, it's, it's uh, it's an art that anybody can do. Children, old ladies, they all do it. It's really, really easy. It's, I'm not trying to sell it to, obviously I want to make money, but it's the truth. The truth is anybody can learn it. All you have to do to show up to your local Jujitsu school and just watch, just go and just watch a couple times. It's free. You don't have to commit to it. Just tell the guy you want to watch and you watch and you realize all my God, I had it all wrong. You know, yet you expect that you're gonna show up and there's going to be all these fucking douchebags killing each other and bleeding on each other. And you realize it's a bunch of nerds. It's a bunch of computer nerds. And, and after you, after you watched one class, you should be sold on it and you don't have to roll. And Do, you know, people are scared of rolling and oh, would it be taps and hurts me. It's so rare that anybody gets hurt. Really. It so rare

Speaker 5:          01:36:23       usually get hurt more from positions than you do from submissions. You get hurt more when you leg gets tripped on to you, but you know, as you get better at it, that becomes less than the last. And as you, if you're in a good school, like 10th planet or like there's so many good schools in La and we get spoiled, but most places have to be good in order to stay open in this day and age because there's so much competition. Does amazing amounts of competition.

Speaker 3:          01:36:46       Yeah. From Jujitsu are beginning classes are, we kind of changed up a little over the years. I realized that most people are a lot more scared of going to a Jujitsu class and checking it out and taking one class than I thought. They're way more scared than I thought. So I understand that. I used to, I used to think that, you know, if you should know that it's a safe sport and you should know if you want to do it or not. And if you're not totally into it, I don't want to talk you into it. You should just know. And then that leaves me with a small percentage of the population, which I consider you're my family. But in reality, if uh, I changed my beginner classes and make them more, cater more to the guys that want to do it. But they're just scared of debt. They're scared of death of signing a contract. They're scared to death of getting hurt. They're coming into Jujitsu is scared. So you got to really think about, uh, just walking them through it nice and slowly showing them that there's nothing to be scared of. This is a beautiful thing that everyone can learn. You can learn to get really good at putting people to sleep in six months.

Speaker 5:          01:37:51       You know, another thing is, um, don't be afraid to tap. That's another thing that I, I make sure I really tell people, it's nothing wrong with tapping. It's not that bad. Just go in there and tap. It's, it's, you've got to think about it. Like someone's scoring a point on you in basketball, it's going to happen. It's totally normal. Yeah. And once you get past that, and especially if you're training with good people, you tap them, they tap you. Doesn't matter. It's good for you. And if you can't have a guy but he can cat tap you, guess what? That's good for you too. It's good for you to know that someone can tap you. You need to up your game and up your skill level to get to the point where he's at, but just because he taps it was no big deal. It doesn't matter.

Speaker 5:          01:38:26       People tapped people all the time. That's one of the biggest reasons people are afraid to come in and they're afraid to lose this game of death cause really that's why Jujitsu is so fascinating and such a beautiful thing because really it applies to life in on the streets, saving your family, protecting your, your children, protecting your wife, your wife, protecting your children and back and forth, your children knowing Jujitsu and protecting their father and son, you know, whole family where everyone does Jujitsu. That's increases your chances, chances of survival and like some apocalyptic era. Well either way, it's a great way to exercise. It's a great discipline. It's, it's great for your body. It's great for your mind. Like after we leave Jujitsu class, tell me when we more like loose, relax and silly. Then after Jujitsu meals like to leave the parking lot after Jujitsu conversations where everybody's exhausted.

Speaker 5:          01:39:20       You've been fighting for your life for the past hour and a half and we're all just hanging out, chilling, and tried to kill each other just an hour before virtual reality. Exactly, and you get used to that. It becomes a normal thing for folks where it's not a normal thing. It seems daunting. It seems terrifying. It seems uninviting, but believe me, I know a lot of, like you said, nerds and it's a lot, a lot of Nice people in Jujitsu to people who have a good control of their ego. We've, we've talked about that on this podcast many times, but I think it needs repeating and it's absolutely, I can't tell you how many tweets, emails, messages, how many, I guess I listened to you guys talk about Jujitsu on the podcast over and over, and then I finally went to a school and I tried it and guess what? You are right.

Speaker 5:          01:40:03       This is amazing. This is changing my life. My son's doing it now too. It's toe and that is the most likely outcome. If you give it a shot and you have an open mind and leave your ego at the door is it's gonna Change your life for the going to give you without a doubt, it's going to be one of the best vehicles for developing your confidence that you can ever find. It will change your confidence. And that's women, including women. You know, like think about a women that you know that have gone to, your school's gone to different Jujitsu classes and gotten better at it and then they become like more relaxed person. They become a different person. They're not worried about their self defense around men anymore. They know that the reality is a girl is a brown belt in Jujitsu. Like remember when we had Felicia do that thing with Seymour Butts? Yes. Explain any more bucks is a nice guy. He's a porn star and a porn

Speaker 4:          01:40:54       producer and he had a show on showtime on showtime. I don't remember what the name of it was. Do you remember the show? Maybe we'll just see more butts. I don't remember what it was. But anyway, real nice guy. And one of the episodes, he wanted to come down and do Jujitsu. Uh, with a woman? No, no, no. He just wanted to come down and do Jujitsu. Oh really? It was not with a woman. He didn't want to do it with Felicia. Did you set that up by Harvard? Felicia. Oh, who's a friend of ours. She's a black belt under John Jacques Machado and a legit bonafide bad ass. She's like 135 pounds. She's not a big woman, but she is strong as fuck. And her Jujitsu is top notch and she's really smart. She's super, super, super smart. So she just gets good at anything. She just knows how to get good at shit and her and see more butts rolled.

Speaker 4:          01:41:42       It was like his first day and she man handled this poor lad. He didn't get hurt. He just lost the game. She was so nice. Never feels amazing when you tap out, it doesn't feel refreshing. No, and that's why it's so beautiful because it didn't feel good. You just lost a game of death. No one got hurt. But that tap represented the fact that he had your life in his hands. And the only reason he let go his cause he's a cool guy and everyone's cool in class. But in reality of if he, if he was a Douche bag and he wanted to kill you, he could have, yeah, they take your life. If someone wanted to choke you out and then stomp your head out while your unconscious, that's what happens. But the point is, Felicia, being a small woman, uh, just, just using her technique, just tapped him over and over and over again, got an a triangle, got his back, got him in an arm bar.

Speaker 4:          01:42:33       And the way she did it was so fluid and beautiful and you watch the episode, it, it doesn't, I don't think it goes down like that. They edit it to make him look good because we shot a segment where I'm teaching and I'm teaching him and we're doing the teaching segment. And then I asked them, do you want to roll to, cause he didn't even know where like rolling, we kind of spar and he said, yeah, yeah, we'll shoot that and we'll do that. And I go, well we'll spar with the woman you know and make it. And it was like, ah, okay. Whatever. That was your idea. That is so funny. It was so long ago I forgot. Yeah. Generally if you're a girl out there and you do Jujitsu for solid for one year solid you, the chances of you getting raped go down significantly.

Speaker 4:          01:43:20       It's very hard to rape a Jujitsu girl and it doesn't take that long to get good at what it said within two years. Time flies you, they'll be doing it three years just like that. And you're a bad ass. The last time I rolled with Felicia, I think I was a purple belt. I might've been a brown belt, was either purple or brown belt and it's not like I was like trying to kill her, but I didn't tag her but didn't dabber. So he's 135 pounds and she just fucking good man. Really? She's fucking, she's really strong and she's fucking good. And when someone's really good, they know how to put themselves in the perfect position and they know how to keep, they know how to keep getting away from anything that you're trying to do to them and putting themselves in a better position to defend a better position to attack that being many steps ahead of the person you're doing it with because they don't know what you're doing.

Speaker 4:          01:44:02       Give someone a massive amount of confidence. And I've seen girls go into Jujitsu class, start getting good, and then start tapping out guys. And when they start tapping out guys is a wild thing to watch. It's a wild thing to see the guy's face. It's a wild thing to see a girl like cinch up. First girl I ever saw type of dude out was his girl junk and he used to roll with, they were both beginners. And uh, do you remember we got Dunkin and Ari gave them a free year for like Christmas. Do you remember that? Uh, yes. Yeah, very well. Ari, Ari stuck it out. Are he got some taps in? Not some dudes. He kept going, but Dunkin ran into this girl who was very pretty and very girly, but she tapped him with the quickness, like how many times did she tab? I'm just happy with like several.

Speaker 4:          01:44:48       It was ugly, but that was, it was fascinating to watch. Like this girl realizing like she could, if she knew the techniques better, she could get a guy. The guy's probably stronger than her. She can still get them that scarred Duncan. He, no, he didn't lie. I think he showed up to maybe a handful of classes at most. He already stuck it out for awhile. Yeah, but with Ari, he got hurt. He, something happened to his knee, I think. Got a staff and then he had a, well he had an meniscus surgery and then he got staff. Yeah, and that was too much. You couldn't take it. Some people. There's a small percentage of people that get hurt doing Jujitsu and that scares them and they never want to come back with generally, most of the people who do what you did to love it so much that the first thing they think of when they get hurt, they're pissed off because they're going to be out for six weeks or they're going to be out for three months.

Speaker 4:          01:45:38       They're going, that's why they're pissed. They can't wait to get back. And you can't wait to get back so much that you're like, you see a lot of times you come back too early and you're not really healed ride and then you reinjure yourself. So that's generally, if you come in with an open mind and you leave your ego at the door, generally you're going to fall in love with it. It's going to change your life. And when you get hurt, you're more bummed about missing Jujitsu than you are about the actual injury, you know? But there are some people that they might, they get ringworm once and they're like, fuck this. You get what you want me to except ring warm. You know, it's very easy to eliminate ringworm. You never have to deal with it. If you can be consistent with the yogurt and the acid office and defense soap, get some defense.

Speaker 4:          01:46:18       So absolute tell everybody is the best. And it's a great company owned by great guy in the company. They said they support wrestlers and they developed soap that cleans your skin without fucking up all the natural bacteria. All the healthy for. I was resistant to defense. So for a while I never really looked into it in the very beginning. I thought it was so self that had all these antibiotics, antibiotics, and chemicals that I didn't want to have nothing to do with it. It just sounded like that. But when I finally looked into it and found out that it was just eucalyptus, eucalyptus oil and

Speaker 1:          01:46:50       oil at in high amounts, it's like wait like three times the amount that you find it. And I bring that everywhere on the road with me. I don't, I don't go to a hotel room unless I have that sheet. I use deep defense soap every day, every day. Now once I found out it was all natural and I was sold and now that I don't need shampoo anymore, I use it on the top of my head too. I use it everywhere. I use it a shampoo. Damn you crazy. You crazy. That keeps dandruff away cause Dandruff is a form of fungus similar to ringworm. Totally makes sense. Yeah. Well healthy skin flora is something that people don't even think about. But you know, I mean that's what killed a lot of motherfuckers back in the day when people got scratched and you know, they got some sort of infection and you know, they, they, people used to dive infections all the time.

Speaker 1:          01:47:39       That's like one of the biggest death. So it was the biggest scary things about going into a hospital today is infections. You know, and you can do a little bit to prevent that stuff by healthy diet. Eating a lot of probiotics. Even if you're a Vegan, say if you only eat vegetables, you could still get probiotics in the form of Sauerkraut. Sauerkraut, like natural, raw sauerkraut. Super good for you. Can have acid off pills. Well see they shouldn't even really have Kombucha because Kombucha is a fungus and the fungus is actually closer to a, a person than an aunt than a plant is. Funguses are actually closer to human beings and plants are funguses are actually much more like an animal than they are like a plant. So if you're a true Vegan and you're eating Kombucha, you're kind of a hypocrite. The mushrooms, you're kind of a hypocrite.

Speaker 1:          01:48:27       Too Shallow. But the, I mean that's probably, they actually probably want you to eat him and that's the whole idea behind silicide. [inaudible] silicide been wants you to eat it. That's why it's big and white and gigantic. It's it, it shows up like it shows itself very easily on a, on like a cow patties and shit like that. Like it's literally like inviting you to come and eat it. Cause that's how it communicates with the light. Yeah. I mean come on. How beautiful red ones, right? Yeah. Beautiful though. Let's say Amanita Mascara, but silicide been the ones that grow on cow shit. They have, you know, the big giant ones in the Amazon. They grow the size of dinner plates, what's the difference? They both get you to that other dimension. Am Anita miscarry is a very controversial mushroom. And for folks who never heard of the Amnesia miscarry and had one red one with the white spots, it's literally Santa Claus.

Speaker 1:          01:49:13       Okay. And I'll break it down real quick. For people who have never heard this before, go to my wife. Look, look up Joe Google. Joe Rogan a Santa Claus was a mushroom. I wrote a whole article about it and like to balance the 2006 or something like that on my website. And what I'm about to explain, I'm gonna have to explain to people, okay, the Amanita miscarry and mushroom is native to Siberia, to Europe. It's a different mushroom, the mushroom, the psilocybin mushroom that you see in tropical climates. And you also, we've seen a lot of places now the Pacific northwest has a lot of, um, it's that, that's a different experience and that's a much more accessible experience and it's much more reliable experience. The AMANITA Mascara oftentimes isn't even psychoactive. Like they don't know what makes it psychoactive and what doesn't. There's all sorts of speculation that it could be a genetically variable.

Speaker 1:          01:49:58       It could be seasonally variable. It could be, you know, the strains of it that grew in certain areas and they were super potent, but they don't exist anymore. Or You have to find, I've never had a good Amanita miscarry trip. I only had one, um, to speak of. That was, uh, that really blew it out. But we took 'em we took silicide been to, we took damn Anita for like an hour and it wasn't doing shit. Is that us? No, no, no. It was me and Stan. Hope me, Stan Hope and um, Yon Urban, how many grams? He made this weird soup. He made like a tea with the, uh, the Amanita Mascara. Like he knows how to do all that shit. He's yon is pretty well versed in how to prepare these things. There was amount, an amount, a specific amount that tends Mckenna and five, about five grand.

Speaker 1:          01:50:42       Five. Well, that's, that's, that's silicide and this is the [inaudible] scary like I was saying. Okay. So we took that and then, uh, an hour or so in, we decided to jump it with psilocybin and then when we jumped it with silicide man, wow. The, the two of them together, it was pretty fucking intense and it was the day of the war. So it was really, really, really weird. And we had this motto de Cocoa Tea. It's a, it's cocaine tea. It's tea that's a derived from cocoa leaves. Like natural coca leaves is more shear that yon had legal, I don't want to believe so I would say nay. But uh, it should be because the, the actual leaves themselves in these indigenous high altitude hurting populations, they just chew them, could shoot them all day and it's like tobacco to them or like anything else that people normally have.

Speaker 1:          01:51:33       It's like, you know, like chewing gum or something like that and it provides a clean stimulant. It's when you break it down and turn it into cocaine, then it becomes like a real fucking pain in the ass comes addictive and you know, people get weirded out on it, but they say it's actually better for you than coffee if you just chew the leaves. I, I just found out within the last year I saw a documentary on where uh, ecstasy comes from the, the, the ingredient Mtma, right? Yeah. It comes from these trees in Thailand and Cambodia. They're like chopping down all these trees to get like the inner core of it. And that's what makes ecstasy. How crazy is that? Like a pure lab created thing? I did too. I think there was a vice documentary on it. Another fucking vice one. Those vice guys are on top of everything. Maybe that's the one I saw, probably. Yes. But it was fascinating. It all comes from Cambodia and Thailand and there's a lot of violence associated with where these trees are now because people are killing people to try to get to these trees. Crazy. Yeah. I wonder what, uh, how that would be like taking it naturally like right from the tree. I know, right? I wonder if you could, that's the truth. That's a movie. A group of guys that go find a tree that's like three hot

Speaker 2:          01:52:46       chicks. All the chicks die of course within the first 45 minutes or one survives only one at the end. Ecstasy is a funny one,

Speaker 1:          01:52:53       man. It's a really funny one. It's a really interesting one because it's a, it's thought of as like a party drug and it certainly is, but you can learn a lot on ecstasy. Man. I've only done it once, but I learned a lot. I had a very beneficial trip. I paid the price with my, my, my mental health for the last couple of days afterwards I was wrecked. Yeah, and my brain was not working well, come down. It's terrible for me. It was for some people apparently is not. Or if you take five HTP supposedly if you a you down five HTP, new mood. That's why that's five HTP as well. We moved. It has a nail trim specifically created for the party or well, used to be a roll on roll on and roll off. Do you remember? Are you joking around really serious? You don't remember. Don't remember.

Speaker 1:          01:53:39       Roll on. Aubrey created it. The, the original thing was RB likes to party and he created it to two k for the comedown off ecstasy because five HTP, new mood became right, sort of. It became, it was enhanced and now new mood has a bunch of different shit in and like Elle trip to fan which converts to five HTP. So it has like a time release, etc. Yeah. Well it's better in that there's more than one mechanism for converting five HDP to Serotonin. The El trip to fan converts to five HTP, which to convert to Serotonin. It gives you the building blocks to replenish your serotonin surprise after you do something like that, but also gives you the extra serotonin throughout your day would, which picks your mood up so much self man that they save for people who are taking ssrs or antidepressants, they tell them not to take five HTP because Neal Brennan, you know Neal Brennan, the dude who I met from the show, he uh, was on five HTP but it was also taken an antidepressant. The doctor told him to lay off the five HTP cause he would give him too much serotonin. Huh? Yeah. That's for real. Oh, it's definitely for real. Have you tried any of that shit?

Speaker 2:          01:54:42       Well, I will say this, uh, Depeche mode was just in town last month and after the Depeche mode concert, I did take some new mood. Took about four of them.

Speaker 1:          01:54:51       I see what you're saying. Yeah, I see what you're saying. Without saying you're talking about it. Know he should've done, he should've taken alpha brain before the Depeche mode concert and you wouldn't smart enough to not go

Speaker 8:          01:55:02       oh,

Speaker 1:          01:55:04       oh no. Oh No.

Speaker 2:          01:55:07       I sold out the staples center three nights in a row. Come on. We haven't had a hit singles, 10 years flight status, old friend of ours, I think you were friends with them. I was friends with him. He used to work at the comedy store. I was murdered last night. I don't ever remember. Katie used to work there. I at the comedy store and he recently moved to Las Las Vegas. And what happened is this gunman came into at night club, I believe it took a comms and a shot, two uh, two guys and then, uh, he was just a supposedly a guy that was at this club and he tried to tackle guy because he's, the guy was pointing his gun too, like innocent people. So he was like doing a hero thing and then he got shot. And you remember, I don't know if you remember, Katie is one of the nicest guy I was dating Katie. No, no, his name was Kay. His name's Katy. Katy. Yeah. We talked about Katie yesterday on the podcast. I'll hilarious. She was, that makes a k d was wanting to actually my, one of my first friends in Los Angeles when I first moved there. That's terrible.

Speaker 4:          01:56:10       Fuck man. There was another school shooting the other day too. Did you hear about that shit? Yeah. Real quick. Let's really get to the school shooting back to the mushroom thing. I'm reading. Oh yeah. We didn't even describe the difference. I'm reading a baby book and this is, this is back the mushrooms and I will, I've never read so many God damn books in my life over the last six months. My kid, that's his favorite shit is to have, he goes, grabs a book. We have 1000 bucks. He grabs his favorite, but when he sits on my lap and I read it, he loves that. He knows what the last page is. And I'll flip it over, start it over. Sorry. Start it over. And there's this one book about Nicholas the bunny and he's talking about how in the fall I like to watch the leaves.

Speaker 4:          01:56:48       And then in the winter I find shelter from the rain under a toadstool and uh, and it's a mushroom. I never heard mushrooms, uh, called toadstools before. Why is it cause, and then on the other side, there's a mushroom with a tote actually sitting on top of the mushroom, right? Yeah. They'd been called toadstools forever. But they also, if you look up any old school Christmas shit. Yeah. All old school Christmas cards, anything with elves, they all have mushrooms them. And they have that mushroom to Amanita miscarry mushroom. Don't, isn't there, isn't there a myth that if you lick a frog's ass, you get high? No, it's not a myth at all. It's real. Some frogs, frogs. It's different though. What they have is five Meo DMT in them. But what I'm saying is I open up this baby book. There's a little bunny Nicholas the bunny hiding under a toadstool and then they show a mushroom and a frog on top of it sitting down on it.

Speaker 4:          01:57:43       So maybe that's why, uh, when you lick a frog's ass, you get high because they actually sit on mushrooms. Maybe they're using the mushroom texted. We don't extract. Listen, you don't look a frog's ass. You don't lick a frog to get high the way there's, this doesn't work. [inaudible] Grecian. Yeah. This is what it is. There's an excretion from certain types of Frog's skin and you have to rub it on glass. So you take this frog and you rub them on glass and they'll excrete their substance on the grass. Then you take that glass, you put in the sun, it dries out. Then you take a razor blade and you scrape it off the glass and it's a white powder. You smoked that white powder and it's five methoxy dimethyltryptamine. Now is that secretion coming from the rectum? It's coming from their skin. Okay. It's that whole thing of licking a frog is just one of those urban myths. It just, it's just weird than an a baby book. You'll see. You hear about the mess of licking frogs ass and they're sitting on maybe cause you know you, some people put ecstasy pills in their ass for better absorption. You heard of that Brian? Right? So maybe the frog is

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       trying to get high and maybe they figured out how to get high by sitting on a mushroom. It goes up their ass and they get home and then you lick a frog's ass and you gotta. That's all I'm saying. This was in a baby book,

Speaker 1:          01:58:51       the name of the frog, it's called the Bufo. I'll reassess

Speaker 2:          01:58:55       and you can't get followed by looking at, if I remember correctly, it's super concentrated and super dangerous though to do it. To get to lick it, lick it because it's really cool. I remember I bought the, I bought the uh, yeah, you got to Google shit like that. Bottom frog to do this and I been looks called

Speaker 1:          01:59:12       Bufo. I'll various, yeah, cob, it's called the Colorado river towed or Sonoran desert toad contains five Meo DMT and Bufo Tenon Bufo Photon, the photon and be Ufo. T. E. N. I. N.

Speaker 2:          01:59:28       There's a website that sell, sold these frogs. And so I bought one and I had it for like a month that I was like, damn, that dude, was it alive? So you never licked it. I don't even know when ever. I think it's a myth. If you had it, why don't you lick it? I mean, I don't know. I was too scared. Can you, can you Google licking frogs? The toads fandom has concentrated on the surface of its skin and that's why licking is dangerous. Smoking is a different story, however.

Speaker 9:          01:59:56       Yeah. Um,

Speaker 2:          01:59:59       so it's too powerful. If you look at two powerful because it's concentrated.

Speaker 1:          02:00:03       Hmm. The toxic ingredient, the toads venom is called [inaudible], which is burned off all smoking. That's why it's dangerous because the two things are in it. If you burn it off, what's left is five Meo DMT. So you don't want to lick it because if you lick it, it gives you [inaudible]. But photo named gets burned off while you smoke it. That's why it's dangerous toys. Yeah. So I guess it really butthole. So listen to this. This is what's weird. It's a, this, this frog. They're native to the Colorado River or a southern Arizona, California and northern New Mexico. Even though five Ameo DMT is classified as an unscheduled substance, which means it's legal to possess. But the venom also contains [inaudible], which is scheduled. So you all you do, you can be in possession of an illegal substance even though it's not a psychedelic. The weird thing about five Meo, it's stronger than nn DMT and, and DMT is the one that gives you the crazy visuals. But the stuff that we did the first time, that's five me. Oh, it's even stronger than nn and it's legal. The one where I was screaming. Yeah, they did. They miss that one. And this, the sweeping psychedelic drug act of 1970 they missed five meo DM.

Speaker 2:          02:01:16       This is what I had bought at Colorado River town. Yeah, that's the motherfucker. Good thing you didn't look at them. Yeah, because you wouldn't have Google it. You will just, Oh I have Google back then. I don't think, I think this is right before I moved here. Well anybody listening, please don't lick the toad cause you can die and don't, don't like poison this dark dark frogs.

Speaker 1:          02:01:34       Yeah. But if you take that stuff and you smoke it, it's DMT. You will trip your fucking balls off if you smoke. The shit that comes from that toad skin, which is really kind of crazy. The difference between that and Psilocybin is very similar. The silicide been also is an end dimethyltryptamine it's got that and something else. So since uh, siliciden is like four Fox for Loxley and and dimethyltryptamine. So the, the, the last part of it is dimethyltryptamine then five MBO diamonds, a trip to me, which is what these frogs have is diamond field trip to me with like an oxygen mile molecule attached to it. So it has a different impact. But all that shit that's like prevalent in children's books and folklore, like all those elves when you see like if

Speaker 3:          02:02:20       at that guy's name is towed and he has a mushroom head. Yeah. And he has the head of the mushroom. That sounds cool. I was telling you, I, I think that's the people that are making books for kids. You gotta kind of have had a mushroom trip to really want to help kids, you know, and it's kind of like, like, oh, that's crazy. I don't know man. There's a lot of mushrooms, a little, they don't have to trip on my, I don't know, but I swear to God, I watch a lot of educational TV for children and they bring up mushrooms a lot. What is this? It's a mushroom and it's a red mushroom. It's like why? There's so many other things you could have brought up. You're talking about mushrooms just trying to teach it. Mushrooms come up a lot and children's books and in their TV. I don't know what it mean for Mario Brothers.

Speaker 1:          02:03:02       Well, look at what, yeah, we'll think about Lewis Carroll and think about Alison Wonderland. It was all about acid.

Speaker 3:          02:03:06       Yeah. Right now there's billboards everywhere. All over La. There's a new show called wonderland or something, and as a guy and a girl, they're looking at each other's eyes and the background. All of these mushrooms, red hat, red tops, like,

Speaker 1:          02:03:18       yeah. Yeah. Those mushrooms are what they believe to be Santa Claus because it even looks like Santa Claus. Yeah, those mushrooms also, this is where it gets really crazy if you haven't heard the whole spiel before. They are, they're there. They have a symbiotic relationship with coniferous trees, like pine trees that grow under pine trees. They have a Michael Rise will relationship with the soil like the those trees. That's where those things always grow. They feed off of each other, so this fucking thing is always underneath these trees, just like brightly colored gifts that are always underneath Christmas trees. Why are Christmas trees always pine trees? Why do Christmas trees have these ornaments hanging in them? You know, because he's taken these mushrooms. He was to pull them out of the bottom of these trees and then hang them in the tree to dry them out. The other way they drove with dried them out was they would have them in front of fireplaces.

Speaker 1:          02:04:03       That's why socks are white and red. Christmas socks or white and red. Who the fuck has white and red sox? Nobody. Why would you hang your socks in front of the fireplace like that? Because that's how they dried out mushrooms. They used to tie into strings and dangling from a fire and that's how they dried them out. That's how the preserved them. It's like everything about it has to do with Shamans and everything about it has a connection to this mushroom. And that mushroom was like synonymous. The, the Amanita miscarry and mushroom was synonymous with reindeers because reindeer love those fucking thing. Reindeer or Caribou live in Siberia. That's where they live up there. And these motherfuckers, when you're in there like a showman's hut and they're all like eating Amanita Musk area mushrooms and having these tribal ceremonies, they would go outside to pis and the Caribou would literally knock them over to get to their pis because they're pissed. Had Avenue to miscarry a smell to it.

Speaker 3:          02:04:57       Damn Hamilton Morrison did it on vice. Of course he did. He's done everything on the show, right? You puke a lot. Uh, this is the Amanita. Yeah, there's part one, two and three.

Speaker 1:          02:05:08       Oh, he's done it on the frogs. Well, there's another type of fraud. If he shows a scar does it, different thing. There's another type of frog. We take the venom of the frog and you, um, you cut yourself and you, uh, take this toads venom and you put it like directly into your skin. And somehow or another by doing that, by doing it, I think they burned themselves like they burned themselves to like with ash, like a an ember and then they put the frog like so it opens up the pores and they put the frogs venom right into them and they have this transcendent, transcendent, transcendent experience. Is that Hamilton Morris? My stomach is in excruciating pain. He's such a freak in me. I love this guy's got a frog. Yeah, yeah. See they burn you and then they stick this shitting on you and your trip, your balls off.

Speaker 1:          02:05:57       Go meet with the spirit world. But you know there's people throughout history have come up with a bunch of different methods to transcend normal reality, normal consciousness, and in different parts of the world. When they were stuck in some area that didn't have mushrooms, they figured out what Datura does. They figured out what, you know, what is this? What does this cactus do if you light it on fire, you know, what does this Bush, what's in this Bush? People have been finding that stuff forever. These scholars in Jerusalem think that that was what Moses was seeing when he went to the burning Bush. He saw the burning Bush. That was God. He gave him the 10 Commandments. They believe that was DMT because the bush has done, they have like the Acacia Bush, very rich and DMT. It's all over that area. Bush burning DMT, light, DMT on fire get high. It's like it's so obvious.

Speaker 3:          02:06:45       He's expense. I had with mushrooms is back in 2008 I did five grams specifically five grams weighted, put it in a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and went to the zoo and that was a bad choice. Decision fucked up. It was a bad decision. I thought, hey, we be with the animals and to be all about love. We get that. I went with the check and why we were checking out the gorillas is when it hit and all we wanted to do is just sit in the shade and not look at the animals, close her eyes and the visuals you get are just amazing. When people say, oh, that's in your head, you made that up mine. There's no way. If I made that up, it would be fragmented and all fucked up. There's no way. As soon as I closed my eyes, there's a show waiting for me and it's, in my opinion, there's no way I'm, I'm doing this. If it was, if I was running, the show would not look like that. I have the ability,

Speaker 4:          02:07:36       but well, that's the actual, what they believe is that what you're doing is you're, you're hijacking your visual cortex and so that these chemicals impact your visual cortex and create this incredible display because your body does not know how to process what's coming in. That's the idea behind it. It does. It does it. What I've always said is it doesn't matter because whether you're creating it, whether it's real or not real, it's still the same experience. Whether it's real or not real, whether it is real, when it breaks down to it, you're actually seeing that. So whether or not that's your imagination is creating it, that's how people like to dismiss things. Oh, it's just in your imagination. No, it's not. And it doesn't matter. Even if it is because it's still the same thing. It's still this insane, crazy thing that you're looking at.

Speaker 4:          02:08:22       Yeah. So even if it is your imagination, it's still the wildest fucking thing you're ever going to see in your life. So hard to explain. The, the only way I can explain it is like, it's like those visualizers on your iTunes times a thousand. Yeah, it's perfect. It's not broken up to me, in my opinion. Something else is creating it. I don't know what it is, but there's something is creating that cause there's no way I can create this amazing art and it's perfect and perfectly symmetric and it's like snakes of just crazy. So after like five minutes of just sitting there at the zoo, we thought we had like a fear and loathing in Las Vegas moment where we just had to get out. And I just, we ran to the parking lot and it's at the La Zoo and we're looking at the mountains. I'm like, Oh, you're looking at the mountain.

Speaker 4:          02:09:09       Look at the mountain. I instantly understood what all the Aztec art was all about. Like that's what they're seeing. And I go, you look at them at the mountains were dancing. The guy who, who gave it to me, he goes, dude, the clouds are going to dance for you. I thought that was a metaphor. I didn't know he actually meant that. And anytime you focus on something for one second, you look at the clouds, they start dancing for you all perfectly. It's like, well, it's, Ooh, it's a weird feeling because it feels like something's there all the time. You just can't see it. That's what it feels like. Whenever I've been on mushrooms, like when I was talking about the, um, the one where Doug and I took the Amanita miscarry and then the psilocybin. Yeah, the feeling I got and it didn't last very long because there was so many things going through our head and it was the day of the Iraq war, the day the war started.

Speaker 4:          02:09:53       So it was a pretty freaky moment. But I saw this honeycomb pattern in front of me, like where everything I saw, like the pattern of the universe. And it like occurred to me like, oh, this is here all the time. I just don't see it and that's what it feels like when you see those things dancing. Absolutely. It was incredible. It was so hard at, that was the craziest drive home. It was exact. When I first time I saw fear and loathing in Las Vegas, I thought, man, this is so unrealistic. It doesn't, you don't see shit like that when you get high. I've been high planning at times you don't, but I understood it because the drive home, I didn't know it was, I should've been dead. There's no way I should have made it home. I didn't know if that was cars next to me, that we're right here. The it felt I was driving

Speaker 7:          02:10:34       through a jungle. It was cranberry. You. You called me. He said, dude, the road turned into flower pedals. Yes. Like I was being guided by, I was in a jungle and there was flowers and and Green Moss and I'm driving through it and I could see the cars like in the distance, but just in my little cube, my little circle, I was in the, in the forest when I should've been dead. I don't recommend that. If you're going to experiment with psychedelics, I'll stay home, I'll stay home. Cause what does it show? The Fun and the great part of it is being in a dark room and closing your eyes and checking out the light show in your head. That's the, it's not like you pass out or anything. Like if you smoked DMT, you pass out and it's kind of like you're in a dream state. But with mushrooms you're completely conscious. You could talking, but as soon as you close your eyes, it isn't like it takes a 10 1520 seconds to dissolve into this show that the instant you close your eyes, it's right there waiting for you. It's like right in front of your eyes and it's deep, five dimensional and it's perfect. There's nothing breaking off. It's just it. To me, there were some intelligence behind it.

Speaker 1:          02:11:42       Well it certainly feels like there's some intelligence behind it, but the thing that's always struck me, as weird as it always feels like it's there all the time. Like whenever I do DMT. One of the weirdest things that happens is this feeling like, oh, I've been here before. Even before ever did it. The first time I ever did it, I was like, I've been here before. I know this place. Like I know this place. You know it's, I don't know why with the mushrooms. Awesome. All those. It seems like all those who listened, they did. Like I said, I've done this before. Well, one of the reasons mo most likely is that mushrooms and DMT on these, all these things like mimic human neurochemistry. So w the, the real wonder is what's happening to you while you're sleeping? What's happening to you for that six to eight hours, whatever it is, where you're out cold, they don't really know.

Speaker 1:          02:12:25       But they do know that the human mind mimics the reactions to, to, to a diamond field trip. To me, not only does it produce diamond field trip to me, but it produces similar reactions like dreams. When you're done with a dream, it's hard to remember it. You know? You know how that is. Yeah. You know, it's weird, man. It's like the dream is so amazing. I, I've said to myself too, like, oh, I don't have to write this down cause I'm gonna remember it cause I'm a lazy bitch. I don't want to get up and write something down. I'm like, I'm not going to forget this. And then I wake up in the morning like, what the fuck was it? I don't remember it at all. Forget. Yeah, DMT is the same way you do DMT and the dream, just whatever it was, whatever the experience was disappears like in the morning, you can't remember it or when it's over or rather you can't remember it. Well, how about when you're dreaming, you don't remember reality. Exactly right. It's true.

Speaker 7:          02:13:11       You don't remember it so much that your uncle could be David Cassidy is fine with it. Yeah, man do. I could totally cool with it. You're not going. Wait a minute. How the fuck is he? My uncle? He's my uncle. The Partridge family. Wait a minute. We had a dream like David Cassidy. Yeah, like random people would show up in my dream and you accept you don't, you don't remember. You remember this dimension as much as you remember your dream state when you're in this dimension. So it's like, man, what, what is it really? And when you, when you think about like that were all empty space, you know that quantum theory where you know, at the subatomic levels we're 99.99, nine, 9% empty like this, this is empty your, this, your body's empty to how is that possible? It's solid. How is it possible that this is empty?

Speaker 7:          02:13:58       When you look at it at the subatomic level, how is that possible? It's so hard to wrap your brain around. Well, we had that unmet go swami guy. Yeah, I heard that. Great. Great podcast. Did you understand a word he was saying? Some of it, some of it I faked it through. So I wonder if it has like the reason this is solid. I wonder, you know, cause uh, electro magnetic energy is running through everything, right? So that's, it seems like it's must be powering everything. Like where do we get our electricity? We're plugged into the universe house and according to science, uh, were just flooded with electromagnetic energy and it's just running through everything. So it seems like that's how we might be plugged in and that's what's giving us the power because it's not our muscles that are, are doing anything. It's the electric pulses that are doing it.

Speaker 7:          02:14:45       That's where you're getting your strength from and that's what's running your heart. You know, your heart isn't just beating there. It's connected to this, this ocean of electromagnetic energy that we're in. So for electoral magnetic energy magnets might have something to do it. So I'm thinking, you know, when you, you try to put a magnet together, there's like nothing there, but it's solid. Like maybe the subatomic particles that were created, it's, maybe it's solid because it's really just a magnet in a, in its own little unique form. Like it's really not there. It's not, but the way it's the, the photons or whatever, I'm just making shit up. I'll put together the way they're put together. It's a certain form of magnet. Like this is this kind of magnet. It's the skin magnet, but it's really not. They're just like, when you try to put it on back fucking talking about, well, we're all empty space.

Speaker 7:          02:15:32       I'm trying to get the magnet thing. When you tried to put two magnets together, you can't because it's like you don't see anything there, but you just can't, it just something solid, Ken, if you flip it. But you know what I'm saying? That there's nothing there yet. It's solid. Like they're saying something's there. Maybe, maybe since we're all a running through electromagnetic energy now this is just my crazy stone theory. Maybe it has some because people are baffled or the top scientists don't even know what the fuck. Like how was this empty space? How was this empty space? When it's solid to us, maybe it has something to do with, uh, like particles being magnetized. Who knows? You know, the points are just theories. The point is there's this matter in a book anywhere. The reality, the reality of quantum mechanics, this is what we absolutely know is that particles can be in a state of super position, which means that they're moving and they're still at the same time. Yeah. They blink in and out of existence. They, we have no Orleans of times per second and particles from,

Speaker 4:          02:16:30       you know, here could, they could be on the other side of the planet and they react instantaneously if faster than the speed of light. They split out of that. They'd done experiments without split up a photon, whatever they, and they separated by 14 miles or whatever. One experiment was 14 miles there in different labs and whatever they did to this, half of the Photon, the other half reacted in the exact same way. So that's the lag with no lag at all. They don't understand it. Yeah. So just that alone is like, that's science fiction. Those are all the blink in and out of existence. Yeah. Like Shit, how does it work? I think there's something way more to this world than we're ever going to be able to wrap our heads around with what are our crude minds and bodies can perceive of the reality that we exist in.

Speaker 4:          02:17:13       Yeah. I think we have this idea that the reality of the we exist in the measurable reality we exist in is all there is. Yeah, but I think there's probably a whole soup of possibilities that we're swimming in. We don't know. We're not, we're not interacting with it. We don't have the, but we also know it exists. Like that's Karma. You know that's love. That's like the one that's momentum and you start having good things go your way. Good things tend to stay going your way and it all sorts of feed into other good things. There seems to be like a way the universe would like you to to react and behave and it rewards you with like a positive experience. It rewards you with love and if you pay attention to people that are living like a fucking disaster of a life, the universe is not rewarding them at every turn.

Speaker 4:          02:17:59       It's fucking them up, their cars breaking down to getting arrested. They're girl hits him in the head with a fucking frying pan when of sleeping. It's like a constant stream of shit keeps coming their way until eventually they either die or get locked up. And it's like the universe is setting that up as well. It's like, it's like forwarding or not rewarding the correct behavior or the incorrect behavior. Life is so perfect, so beautiful. And so it's just incredible. I mean, as humans we have the intelligence to make satellites and rockets and airplanes, but we can't even make a flee. We can't make a fleet. We have no idea how that shit works. Making an athlete that can fucking check another fleet. How can we can't make a tree? Yeah, we can make a tree. We think we've got to figure it out. We think there is no higher intelligence out there.

Speaker 4:          02:18:46       Some kind of something come on. It might even just be law, you know, it might just be a law of the universe or um, you know, instead of a law, like an equation, like you know, positive and love and this and that and moves towards this direction, negative and horrible and evil moves towards that direction. And it's almost like the two need each other to do battle back and forth and to empower to empower the other. Absolutely. Esther Hicks says, you know, it makes sense like you were here. Who knows if this is true. This is just something that someone said that it's seems pretty awesome to me that it seems that we're here, we're existing, we're supposed to feel the pain because if we don't feel

Speaker 7:          02:19:28       the pain, we're not going to appreciate the good stuff and it's not going to feel as good. Like she uses an example of your best meal is always eaten when you and your hungriest and that totally makes sense. Like if you're never hungry, you won't really give a fuck about food. If you're born a billionaire, you don't care about money, you don't care about what it can buy. And so it's almost like we need, we need the pain where it's almost like we're here for the pain. Well, there's certainly like reward systems

Speaker 1:          02:19:55       built in and it seems like if you look at it like all the animals on this planet, at least there is a struggle that's going on constantly. Nobody lives easy. Everybody's struggling. You're struggling to find food, just struggling to keep off predators is struggling to keep your, your young alive. And it seems like it's set up that way. And it seems like it could be way easier if, uh, there was like total harmony in the animal world. Well, isn't it like life and success, like what they're looking for when they all just be fucking eating plants, when, that'd be like the best way to go about it. But no, it's, it seems like the struggle is built in to

Speaker 7:          02:20:29       the whole code of life. Yeah. When there's a battle to try to figure out how to do it right. Well, we want the struggle and a lot of things in movies. We don't want to go to a movie where nothing, there's no conflict or nothing bad happens. That would be the worst movie ever. The greatest movies are the ones that take you down to the depths and you buy it. You are and you've, you suspend your disbelief in, you're down there and then you come up with it and the stories believable and you lose yourself in the movie, but without the conflict, the movie sucks.

Speaker 1:          02:20:57       Do you worry about that with your kid like in a certain way? I do with my kids, it's like I don't want my kids to experience a lot of adversity. Just you want to protect your children. Yeah, but I know that all the people that I know that experience adversity or the most interesting people, you know, all the people that we know, think about all the people that who know look thinkers like Joey Diaz. He's one of the most interesting guys at right because this, his life was completely crazy. Like his life was full, total chaos. Like the adversity you had to go through the adversity. I had to go through the adversity. Cowen had to go like all the people that we know that are interesting. They all had kind of a fucked up life. Yeah. What's that about? Do you think that you could get away with just exposing your kid to a difficult things like Jujitsu, like uh, exposing them to martial arts and maybe they could develop their character that way without having to go through the, the horrible

Speaker 7:          02:21:52       ups and downs of, I don't know if Jujitsu promotes or guarantees a great sense of humor and the ability to make other people laugh. But the one thing in my experience that I know that Jujitsu does for children, absolutely, and it's, it's has a lot to do with you. W you always talk about it when a kid doesn't have martial arts and Jujitsu specifically because of the tapping and getting capped out, what that shows you that automatically in Jujitsu, you know where you stand. You know where you stand, you know that you're a blue belt, you're probably not going to be purple belts that much, but when you do, you'll get your purple belt and you're probably not going to beat brown belts and black belts that much in the beginning. But when you start doing it, then you get your brown belt and so on and your black belt.

Speaker 7:          02:22:39       So when a kid comes into Jujitsu, he's four years old, five years old, he knows that he's not going to, it rarely gonna beat the seven year olds. And when he's seven he's rarely going to be at the 10 year olds. So that teachers, if they don't go through that, there is a possibility. Not always. There's plenty of great kids that have never done Jujitsu, but what I've seen with Jujitsu kids, it almost guarantees that they won't be delusional and become a douchebag kid. Because if you don't, if you're not checked that way with a tap, like reminding you that this guy is 15 years old, you better respect that 15 year old. And then what ends up happening is when you become 15 you, you know what it was like going through the early stages of Jujitsu. So you, I see kids that are 10 and 11 are great with the five year olds and great with a six year olds.

Speaker 7:          02:23:27       It takes you out of that delusionary state and let you know that you better respect your elders and as you get older you better respect the kids too because they're going to get older too. So what you did to really does is people put, it instills discipline in you. Like A, most people think martial arts does like karate and taekwondo and that definitely works too because it does promote discipline. But Jujitsu does it I think better because of the tapping. Most kids that I know that are good at Jujitsu, they have a tremendous relationship with their father. It brings them tighter traveling all over the world like I do to all these seminars. Um, oh, I don't know how many times I've met kids is Jujitsu phenoms that are eight, nine years old. And their dads bring them to Jujitsu and they're best friends Avery down in, um, uh, and uh, uh, he used to be a Springfield.

Speaker 7:          02:24:20       Now he's an Oma, he's 16 now. Him and his dad are best friends. And when I'm, when I run into them like, man, give me advice. You know, what else did you do? Cause there it just, you see it over and over again. So, um, for those of you with kids out there and maybe you're having trouble with the kids, try to talk them into Jujitsu, you know, it, it might be hard, but I think that if you're having trouble with your kids or you want to insure a beautiful relationship, tight relationship, a trusting relationship and you know, relationship where the kid, your kid wants to hang out with his popping and you did you just, until you do it with your kid, that that's just a little something that I've learned. That's a little insight. You can take that for what it is. I, I, I'm just, I'm just trying to,

Speaker 1:          02:25:00       if anything the kid can do that's difficult. It's good for their personality development. One of the real problems with kids today's cause everything's handed to you. You don't develop character because you don't ever face adversity. Your food comes from a supermarket. You can go to a store and get whatever you fucking need. You know, it's not hard. It's, it's, it's easy to live life. And so when, when you're not tested, especially as a young person, like a lot of bullying comes from and people say like, what's the best way to stop bullying? I always say the best way to stop bullying is teach kids how to fight. If you had like mandatory Jujitsu classes, if you had mandatory martial arts classes in school, you would have a whole lot less bullying because first of all, that they wouldn't be inclined to do it. And second of all, it wouldn't work.

Speaker 1:          02:25:41       Like if a guy is talented and skilled and he's 155 pounds and there's an asshole that's 180 pounds, it's fucking with them. He's not gonna back down. They're going to figure out a way around it. The kid's going to be able to figure out a way like, listen, you know, if you want to fucking fight, you want to be an asshole and pick on me. I have to fucking defend myself. Then I'll defend myself. But it's not like is going to be terrified, not know what the fuck to do. It's going to be a completely different scenario. And I think that one of the reasons why people do it in the first place is they're trying to, they're trying to prove that they aren't scared themselves. The reason why people are bullies where they have that instinct is they're insecure. They're trying to be dominant without, you know, without putting in the work. But if you put in the work, if you do Jujitsu, if you were in a martial law, he actually develops and proficiency. You don't have that need. You don't have that need to dominate people. You don't have to know. You get it all out, you get it all out in the gym.

Speaker 2:          02:26:26       All my boys were wrestling the wrestling team. So that kind of like know wrestling's different dressings, a sport and probably they're just sick or you know, where you're, I mean, did you have bullies growing up? Not really. I mean, uh, I was bullied before I started doing martial arts, but from like 14 on, not really cause I was like thinking about like all my bullies were all guys in sports, like football team wrestling the time I wrestlers. Yeah, with bullies. In what way? Like how were you bullied? You know, like just pushed her out on the, the playground and stuff like that. And like what year are you talking about? Middle School. Elementary and middle school used to trip you a trip. You like when you're walking ticked with, yeah, I was fucked with a lot. But then like in high school and it went away. It's a douchebag move, man.

Speaker 1:          02:27:15       Be a bully. It's one of the worst things a person can do. Yeah, it's a, it's a weird, natural human weakness. So weakness, instinct to like fuck up. Picky.

Speaker 2:          02:27:25       Yeah. My shit was mostly cause evo. My parents were divorced and I was poor. I think it was that big. Why they picked our meme. It's they pick on you because you were poor. Yeah, cause I lived in Worthington, which is a higher end place in Columbus, but I was like living on that one part that was all apartments. That was, it shouldn't have been in there, you know? But somehow I was in Worthington so they knew I was poor and my parents were divorced back then. Back then divorce. It wasn't as crazy as it is now. Where you know was unusual. Yeah, a little bit more unusual. Yeah. Isn't that weird that like when we're younger, people didn't bother getting divorced or they didn't happen nearly as much? Not, not in my neighborhood. Everybody got divorced. All my friends didn't have fathers. All of them except one. Norio Galvin. He's the only one out of maybe 15 friends that we had gone up. Everyone, every father left in a really poor neighborhood was all Mexican. You grew up in Mexicans believing they get drunk and go back to Mexico

Speaker 3:          02:28:21       and say, fuck that. Yeah. Isn't that weird man? When people that don't take take care of their kids as a father now it doesn't have freak you out. Yeah man, I can't imagine me out. My father had 19 kids from eight different chicks, God 19 is he still alive? I don't know. What kind of crazy hell does that guy live in when he closes his eyes and one of the last, the last time I saw him, I was 27 and he my my on my mom's side, my mom's mother and father, they stayed together to the very end. They were married 50 plus years and had 10 kids. And my dad told me first he told me that at 14 I saw him at 14 then I saw him at 27 at 14 tries to shove advice down my throat and he said, make sure your Mary, when you marry your wife, she's at least 15 years younger than you.

Speaker 3:          02:29:08       He told me that. I remember that. And he also said he also, and my wife was 15 years younger than me. It wasn't strategic, but it just happened that way. And the other thing he told me at 14 was be nice to kids cause they grow up really fast and they'll turn into adults. So he was trying to give me the right advice and then at 27 I haven't seen him in forever. I thought he was dead. He shows up one day and am I at my grandpa's house? He goes, do what? He's old and he's like, do what your grandfather did. That's the way. Have kids every Christmas and Thanksgiving he has all his family and all his grandkids. That's the way I had to do it over. I would do it that way. That's what he said. And he was, I want to some player and just banging everything and just getting everybody pregnant.

Speaker 3:          02:29:51       Wow. That's so sad. That's a sad life man. Yeah. And I asked him, I go, what made you want to come by this time? I was like, he hadn't been around and I just, I heard he showed up to my grandfather's house and he had been friends with my grandfather while he was messing with my mom and him and my grandfather got along and my aunt, Congress, your dads get over here now. Your Dad's, it's your grandma's. And I'm an, I'm in Hollywood. I'd drive down to Orange County and the whole drive down. I'm like, I'm just, I'm not going to give him a hard time. I hadn't seen him in like 13 years and I'm not gonna give him a hard time. I'm just going to start over. I get, I get another chance with my father. I was like dry. It was a long drive, like an hour drive and show up at my grandma's house and I'm happy you got a smile.

Speaker 3:          02:30:29       I'm like, damn, I thought he was dead. I'd have dreams of him dying and he's is this really is right here. Shit, let's go out to eat. Like we went to black Angus in Tustin. My mom went, we're all sitting there like, fuck that. We get a second chance. Meanwhile, I'm all happy to see my father and I rarely, you know, my mom wants to see me more than I actually drive down and see her. But now I want to start another relationship with my father. So then I asked my father, uh, and at this point I didn't know about his 19 kids at this point, if I've got five kids from, uh, I knew he was married, had five kids, and he was seeing my mom and on the side I knew that my mom was a side grow. That's what I do at this point.

Speaker 3:          02:31:07       And I said, why did you come by this time? I'm curious each. And I was expecting them to say, it's been so long. I wanted to see what happened. You know, what's become a view? And he said, ah, just I was passing through Orange County and, and I wanted to see if your grandfather was still cool with me. I didn't know if he was mad at me or anything and I just, I just kept a smile on and bright. They're right there. I looked at my mom and I'm like, fuck this dude. Fuck this guy. I'm a, I'm going to spend time with my mom. Fuck that dude. And just kept a smile on it right there. I made the decision. I will never see this guy ever again, and I never did, but less. So during that dinner, he did say, Hey, one of the two of his kids live in La, the ones from that family, he goes, they want to have dinner with you.

Speaker 3:          02:31:50       They want to meet you. So I did end up meeting with them, never saw them again. They're the ones who told me. They sat me down at the old spaghetti factory in Hollywood when I was 27 and they go, do you have any idea how many kids your father has? I said, five plus me. He has 19 kids. I still, how did that happen? He goes, he got, not only did, did they know about it, he told his family about every kid and every girl he was seeing, he was trying to drive his wife insane to get a divorce. She wouldn't divorce him. She was hardcore Catholic. So she wouldn't divorce. He wanted a divorce. He wanted, uh, uh, to, to marry my mom. That's what he says. But she wouldn't give him a divorce. So he would tell her, they knew all about me.

Speaker 3:          02:32:36       He goes, he would come home and just say, oh, Marty has pregnant now all muddy. I had the baby, we named it Ed God. He would come home to his wife, to his wife and kids and say, oh, Maria had, had just got pregnant. We just had our kid, I'll be gone for the weekend. I'm gonna spend time with my son. So I actually spent my mom, my dad had my mom in an apartment promising that he would leave his, my mom thought he was going to leave his, his wife, his wife for her, for her. She was in love and he never did, but he had her in an apartment in downtown La. And then after like three years, got, apparently I lived with them for three years. My mom just said, enough's enough. She went back to Orange County, back to her parents' house. And that was the end of that weird thing, isn't it?

Speaker 3:          02:33:16       The idea that someone could just do that. When you have kids now and you, you know, I know you, you know, you get on a plane, we were talking about you leave your house. No, you're going away for the weekend. You miss them as soon as you get in your car. Yeah, just start driving away. But this guy could just abandon this kid and then see you and not even have like a connection with you and be like, God, I just want to see if your grandfather was mad at me. Yeah. And then when I talked to them, when I had that, when they told me about the 19 kids, they, it started to make sense. I'm like, no wonder he didn't give a fuck about me. Now I understand the kind of 19 kids. How can you, he was, you know, it was never a dick to me.

Speaker 3:          02:33:49       When he would see me once a year, he would cruise by. Did he hug you? Ah, maybe a little not, but I found out that he never said I love you had a prior. He never told any of his kids. I love you. Never said I love you. So he had something really wrong with them. So then it all became clear like, oh, this guy has no love in him. That's why he just keeps having kids with whoever and he doesn't really care. He was never a dick to me. He just didn't really like care that much about me. It's Kinda weird because that's sort of like if look at nature,

Speaker 1:          02:34:18       if you look at the programming of the human animal then that's like the programming. The programming is to spread your seed as much as possible. The programming is to have as many babies as you can. The program has not for the male to take care of them though. It's really strange. You know, the program is to keep going to keep spreading that seed and that's one of the reasons why they say that. Um, like the intensity of her attraction, like it goes away within a few months of meeting someone, like the intensity when you first meet them. That intensity of attraction for a man goes away with within the first five or six months because usually by then the woman's already pregnant in nature. You've been banging her, you know, every day for several months. One of the days she's been operating, you shot one in there and ensured this intense bond. You know, initially too, to make sure that you continue to having sex as much as possible to increase your odds of getting them pregnant. And then all of a sudden this weird thing kicks in where you want to

Speaker 4:          02:35:15       go. Sometimes I kicked him and as soon as you not post, not syndrome baby. Yeah, but it's, it's, it's a weird, yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:35:22       Dang that, that nature is literally set up that way. And so in order to conform to what society expects from a person, you have to fight against your genetics. You have to literally fight your instinct, your instinct to fuck other girls, their instinct to shoot loads into them. I get them pregnant.

Speaker 4:          02:35:40       Weird. Remember? Do you remember that when we worked on the man show, that sketch I wrote for pulseless syndrome. It was a pill that you could take that, uh, or you could, you could have sex with a girl and not get posted on syndrome. If you take it 30 minutes before Sachs. I don't remember that. And obviously it never, it never got green lighted, but that just reminded me of, because that was a pill, right. That is a real thing with men now. Plus Syndrome is serious. It's the feeling that you have. Like right after you called me, like, oh my God, I gotta get Outta here. I gotta get Outta here. And if you don't have that, that's when you know, like, Hey, I think he's calling somebody and she's cool. I think I found a real relationship. You're like, Hey, let's go get something to eat. Or what do you say? Don't leave. Let's watch TV. What are you saying? What Spooner? What are you saying? What after I come, I just want to spirit and snuggle with every chick. Yeah. And then wake up and do it again. More half retarded. It's different. You know those girls, if you have sex with and they're really dumb and you go, oh my God, why did I do this? And you just want to jump down to when he's as smart as them. So it's perfect. [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          02:36:39       they match perfectly. They talk about shoes. They sit there and talk about who's fat. Girls don't really get posted on syndrome unless they're married or something and you know, then they feel guilty. But if they're not married, if they have sex with you, they, they, they fall more in love with you. All that depression, that depends entirely on what the experience was like. Yes, you're right. More than guys get posted on syndrome way more than girls. It's also the guys that we know too. We know a bunch of savages. If you compare, like we went to an accountant's meeting, you know, and said, hey, how you guys feel after you come. But you know, people, some people managed her talking to him about sex. It's a weird thing when dudes

Speaker 1:          02:37:16       start talking like you and I have done this before, we won't name any names, but we've had sex conversations around square dudes and you watch them panic like they absolutely panic. You know like they don't know what the fuck does say like how often you fuck your wife be serious. Some guys a tell you like fuck my wife like three times a week. No more than that. Like I don't want to fuck her everyday but I fuck her a lot. And some guys would just go, what? They just, they just cleaned him up twice a day. I can't or they will say I can't know what, it's just not something that I discuss. Like you don't discuss how often you bang your wife with another man. Like why wouldn't you discuss that? Do you not love your wife? If you love your wife, you have sex with you. Why? So is that off the books? You can't talk about it like what do you, I'm not, I'm not asking you like specific details.

Speaker 3:          02:37:58       You know, what's crazy about my wife is before the kid, you know, once you, once you going out with a girl for a year or two years, you come home from Jujitsu. My classes are kind of late. A lot of times I'm broken. I just went to war for an hour with guys from out of town trying to tap me. I come home, I'm going to drink a protein shake, I'm going to get on the Internet a little bit. I'm just going to collapse and die generally after Jujitsu. So, um, you know, for a while there, you know, it's like I have sex tomorrow. You just keep putting it off and you don't have sex as much. And then when you have a kid now you can only have sex when that baby's asleep. Right. So now I really can't have it that much. So I wanted way more than ever g cry easy with the voice in the microphone one or to way more than no.

Speaker 3:          02:38:54       Yeah. Oh yeah. I like it. I liked it. The one thing I learned in my old age, the one thing I learned, because I've dated girls that didn't, some girls didn't want sex as much as I did, and that would kind of Piss me off. I'm 23 and it's like, man, this is bullshit. I should, I should get whatever I wanted to. You're my girlfriend. Why are you, oh, you're tired. Like it would, I would get pissed off. And I'm like, man, I want a girl that wants to fuck anytime I want it. You know? So, but then you have girls, and I've had most of the girls were, uh, wanted it more than I did. I was always the tired one. And they always want it. Morning. I get to the point where it's kind of bothersome. I'm like, damn, she wants it way too much. But now looking back at all that and where I'm at now, yeah. Looking back at that now, I would rather want it all the time and rarely get it then always get it and rarely won it. That's the one. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:39:46       that's definitely better. Yeah. As long as you are still getting it. Yes. No. Do you see this state Chell son and Vandelay Silva going to host tough Brazil, the ultimate fighter of reserve effect Chels son and is going to go to fucking Brazil. That crazy ass hole I have to all the shit that he talked on, Brazilians and Vandelay Silva and shale has been like putting like these rhymes up on his, uh, on his Twitter account. Is it going to be an English or Brazil and the Brazilians are going to be, it's going

Speaker 4:          02:40:14       to be a Americans fighting against Brazilians. 16 Americans will go to war to find eight guys and then 16 Brazilians will go to war to find eight guys. That might be the greatest time. Those two teams they might have. So a lot of extracurricular violence. You know, you gotta be careful of your, your coaches. Chell son. And he said a lot of nasty shit. Excuse me. A lot of nasty shit about Brazilians. Liam. He's just talking trash is all he's doing. And if you asked him honestly off the record, he'd say they're great fighters. It's a, it's an honor and all that jazz. But he talks so much mad shit and Vandelay wants to kill him. Vandelay and he was going to be a car Raisie fight. Man, that's going to be crazy. As long as we handle is healthy. I don't want to name any names or any seasons or anything, but apparently there's been some stuff on the ultimate fighter that happened behind the scenes.

Speaker 4:          02:41:02       It was so violent that they didn't want to air it. Really. Have you heard about that? Like fights? Yeah, like Pete, there had been fights that they just completely edit out. Really? Yeah. Yeah. I believe it. I believe it dudes get crazy. They had to have them all still living in houses together. They, yup. This season they have girls and guys living together. Eight girl fighters and it's a great season. This year. Season is awesome at house. Must smell so bad. That's protein far clean. That shit. Dirty guy. It definitely, definitely, probably smells bad. Are you watching the season? Yeah. It's good to Rama between those two chicks, man, jasmine, Duke and what was the girl she fought? Raquel Pennington or something. Was that her name? I'm not sure. But she can hit. Ah, but you're, you're, yeah, yeah, yeah. I didn't see girls names. Yeah. But Jasmine, Duke man, talk about heart.

Speaker 4:          02:41:57       She was getting hit hard and she kept calling back, throw a nice throw him down. And she's, she's actually more of a Jujitsu chicken and she has a striker and man. Talk about heart. She's a, um, out in la now. Training with, uh, Ronda Rousey's team. Dude, you got to come down to the one in December, the UFC in December, December 28th, which we'll come to Vegas. You got to come. Okay. That's the, that's the one word Ron is going to fight Misha Tate. Oh Shit. Yeah. You gotta be there. And it's also Chris Weidman, Anderson Silva dose. Oh Damn. I'm that. Yeah, you got, you gotta be there. That when he should take fights, Ronda Rousey and when they actually step into the octagon. Oh my goodness. That's good. That might, that might be the most insane evening ever. Marinette also, or is that the 18th or something like, ah, let's find out who's Barnett.

Speaker 4:          02:42:44       Funny Maxx is fighting Travis Browne. Oh, that's right. Shit, son. Good fight. Fuck yeah, it is. Yeah. Let me see. Um, to do, do, do, do, so it's front snap kicks that are coming back strong, aren't they? Yeah. They don't want to add on those. Yeah. It's crazy. Isn't it weird that, that that technique by Earl even existed? Do you remember us going over it in your garage and put it on mastering the system? And I remember asking him about a go, why haven't we seen the front snap kicks so much hard land. Yeah. And you were like, ah, it's hard to generate power. And you were throwing a couple on, like when you were throwing like that looks like it would hurt if it landed and boom, right after that Anderson, uh, drop couture with it or know Anderson dropped veto, right. Victoria and then Machita drop couture and now everyone's throwing those snap kicks.

Speaker 4:          02:43:32       Yeah. Overeem goes down with them. That's a big technique now. Yeah. Okay. Let's see. Anderson fight card. Anderson Silva Weidman too. Oh my God. This is an amazing card. Oh, Shonda rouse, he meets me. Should take Travis Brown. Josh Barnett. Oh Shit. Let me some Thai tea bowel versus Michael Johnson. Chris Liebing versus Uriah Hall. Oh Shit. Wait, wait, Chris, listen, leave. And versus Uriah Hall. How is that possible shit, Chris Liebing as a one 85. They're five. Uriah Hall. I thought you were. I thought I was thinking you're a favor by a hall. The winter ultimate five. Okay. Dennis Seaver versus Manny Gambier Aryan. Whoo. Oh my goodness. Goodness. Just nets on it. Sweet. Oh, see our bio design aura. How'd he say it? By her designer versus a Doomsday Howard. Holy Shit. Dustin [inaudible] versus [inaudible] brand. Oh, this card's insane. Yeah. It's December 28th. Jim Miller versus for Breazeale come once. Damn. Oh my God. This is cards insane. I think for Breesa Como lines is that guy that hit that a badass triangle from the mount? Maybe, but now. Yeah. I wouldn't know that was Sergio. Something's different types. I don't know who did it. A different guy

Speaker 1:          02:44:51       either way. What a fucking card. Water card this weekend I'm going to, uh, I'm headed to England. Going to Manchester. UFC. Yeah. Well, I'm going, I was going to do that. Uh, blood treatment thing in Germany, but I'm an, I'm going to do it in Santa Monica. They do it in Santa Monica. What's the blood treatment? So stem cell thing that guys do for their disks. It's supposed to be incredible for it's been, that's the one thing that kept me out of Jujitsu. I've been like we were talking about been uh, injuries and you look forward to getting back to Jujitsu. Had been stitched up before. I've had two knee surgeries and I went back to Jujitsu at my nose fixed, went back to new Gi Jujitsu and everything's fine. But this was a scary one when you start getting numb hands. And then we knew quite a few people that have had like real serious issues with their backs where they have atrophy of their arms and a bus route and has one arm that's like literally half the size of his other arm.

Speaker 1:          02:45:47       It's scary. So I'm not, I wasn't down with any surgeries man. I wanted to make sure that I did all the right things as far as rehabilitate and uh, I got a lot stronger. I came back that one day and rolled pretty fucking hard and didn't have any problems, but it was real stiff. And um, the next day it was stiff and sore, but I'm like at least I could roll. I know I can roll, but I think I can make this thing better. You haven't rolled forward. Go back. I'm enrolled sense mostly been doing just Moitai and uh, a lot of weightlifting, which doesn't bother me. It doesn't bother me with kettle bells and it doesn't bother me with, um, with [inaudible] it's just getting my neck cracked in the day. I came back to your, to the gym too. It was all arm triangles. It was a member.

Speaker 1:          02:46:28       It was a arm triangle transitions and gay teens, which is um, my favorite. I love arm triangles, but God, Dan has a lot of shit going on with your neck. So how you feeling right now today? Feel fine. It's stiff. My back stiff. But that's just cause I lifted weights yesterday. Pretty hard, man. I hope that that works out for you. Be Too. You got to do it too, man. You gotta try that shit back feeling great, but I would, it would make it easy. It's not 100% right, but it doesn't stop me from Roland doesn't sound from training. I just got to really focus on keeping my hamstrings nice and stretch. Never stretched my hamstrings ever. That was, that's the downfall of lower backs is, is a tense and tight hamstring. So that's a new thing of mine where every morning I'm waking up, I'm stretching my hamstrings before class, after class.

Speaker 1:          02:47:15       Sometimes, you know, I, I, I don't have time, but I just, I'm more committed to stretching my hamstrings more than, than anything. This is a stretch. This is what this stuff is, that's important. But this is what, this stuff it's called, it's the, the way, uh, the, the, the term is called regene. Oh, keen. R. E. G. E. N. O. K. I. N. E, a Ortho keen. It's is the actual medical procedure and you take, they take your blood, extract it, the manipulated somehow then reintroduce it to the body as an antiinflammatory drug to reduce chronic pain and arthritis. And the process involves two ounces of blood drawn from your arm and it's incubated in a slightly raised temperature. The liquid is then placed in a centrifuge until its constituents. Parts are separated. The middle yellowish layer is dense with agents that are believed to stop our and arthritic agent known as Interleukin one, which causes degeneration of the joints and a breakdown of cartilage.

Speaker 1:          02:48:13       That serum is injected into the patient's affected area. The procedure reduces pain and discomfort to the joint, and the treatment generally lasts five days with six shots of the serum into the effected area. It's normal for a patient to receive annual injections to ease joint discomfort. So many pro athletes have done this and had miraculous recoveries. Peyton manning went to Germany for this. He's, he'd get two neck surgeries and he was on his way out of football and now he's a fucking superstar again. He's having the best year of his life. It's from this shit. G Dana White did it and he's just raves about the result of it. Supposedly level. If you're, if you have arthritis in your spine, your lower back, Louis, hello from 10th planet. Montreal's got this, he's got arthritis in his back. A guarantee or this would help them. I mean, I don't know how much he has.

Speaker 1:          02:48:59       I don't know what, I haven't seen his MRI, but I guarantee you that this will make him feel better than he feels. Now. I'm going to tell, I'll, I'll give everybody breakdown of it. When I do it. I start next week when I get back from England, I go in, um, and uh, we'll see what happens. You already had all that shit done. Yeah. My, my Mri, I had my MRI done right after the injury. He looked pretty nasty man. I had a six millimeter millimeter bulge in my neck. It's pretty big. You know, it's reduced now quite a bit, but right after the injury it was six millimeters. That's not good. And that's why I was having numb hands and all that shit. And you know, it's from, it's from doing it, getting injured and then taking a couple of weeks off and jumping right back in. That's what it is.

Speaker 1:          02:49:38       Not allowing myself to fully heal up and core strengthening, core strengthening is massive. It's so important. You know, if you're going to be in there throwing down on a regular basis, you got to do some core workouts. You've got to do something that keeps you, gives you a little armor to protect you from being injured. No squats, squats, help a lot. Squats a wind, mills Kettlebell, windmills are huge. I love those. The exam, that is a strengthening your entire core, you know, all that bending and carrying that heavyweight, Turkish getups, that kind of shit. You're doing any shows when you're in England? I am doing two shows. The dance house theater, they're both sold out, so go fuck yourselves. English people, they bring it into late.
