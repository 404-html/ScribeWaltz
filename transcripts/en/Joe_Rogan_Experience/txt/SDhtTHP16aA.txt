Speaker 1:          00:00:03       Fighting the nonsense of the world. Ladies and Gentlemen, the Godfather's back high. Then anybody can get to see you. What's going on? What's going on? I'm here in southern California, shaped. I escaped minus 30 with windshield last week. Didn't leave the house from Friday to Monday with the wind chill factors minus 30 or it's actually minus 30 with the Windchill, so I'd say it's minus 15. Would windshield minus 30? You guys have become too soft and southern California. One hundred percent. What do you mean become been too soft? Yeah. This is a ridiculous place to live. Well, I don't know about that. Is this is like a lottery winner place to live. It's like the weather lottery and these people, they don't understand what weather is. They're just running around. I swear to God. If it gets 50 here, people start complaining that I've seen weather advisories when I used to live here, whether it'd be a 10 minute spell of rain and they'd be endless warnings.

Speaker 1:          00:01:00       Be careful. Careful, careful. Be careful. You know we go through blizzards. There is one reason for that though. The oil slick on. Yeah. When it doesn't rain for a long time, all the oil from people's cars, the residue gets on the road and as soon as just a little bit of water gets on that it gets really slippery and that that is reality, but still before we start, before we said last time when I was here, it was on your birthday and some guy wrote in a very non Semitic way, here it goes, God being a Jew not giving Joe Rogan a gift on his birthday. So I thought that I would correct that by giving you a signed copy of one of my books. So there you go. There you go. To consuming instinct. Now you can grow. What? Juicy Burgers, Ferrari's pornography and gift giving reveal about human nature.

Speaker 1:          00:01:53       There you go, buddy, by and signed by the Godfather. So very exciting. Yeah, well you can't read those. Those things that people say those mean things. I try to avoid them, but once in awhile I get sucked in and they can piss me off. Well, I always equate it to snake venom. It's like a. If you get a little bit of snake venom, you get you get immune to it and get accustomed to it. Whereas if you get a big burst of it, it can poison you, so if you just get a little bit of it every now and then when a big burst comes your way, like someone calling you, achieved you until you go, you motherfucker, it doesn't work anymore. You know, he just realize there's a lot of people out there that a lot of the reason why they're saying these mean things because they're trying to find something that they can say that will get you to respond.

Speaker 1:          00:02:39       Exactly. Right. That's a big part of it. So what. So recently, the latest one is. So somebody trolls you endlessly in a very polite manner. Right? Okay. Usually I, sometimes I try to engage them, but I find them really. I know it's ridiculous, man. You're again, you're an actual professor. I am in the legitimate university. I'm indeed. Isn't it crazy that I would even entertain their Saturday. So once in a while I get sucked into the trap there and polite. So after awhile I blocked them. So these guys then, because I've blocked them, start going around saying, well, you know, he, he's a supposedly a proponent of freedom of speech, yet he blocks me as though I'm the purveyor of freedom of speech, right? I mean, I'm not allowed to come to your house, breaking into your house and start calling you names and if you stopped me, I accuse you of not supporting free speech.

Speaker 1:          00:03:29       Right? But in their minds, if I block them simply because I no longer want to engage them, I am going, I am being a hypocrite because I'm not supporting their freedom to insult me. See, again, I have to go back to what I said earlier, why you're so smart. Like what, what, how is this even getting into your mind? Can I tell you what it is? Oftentimes, yes. I find that galling that somebody could be so insulting calling. Does that word mean like a, right? Yes. Right. I mean we interact. You and I with a million people a day with most of the people. They're lovely. They're sweet, they're polite. They might. Vast majority. Right? So. So when you get this individual who simply can't modulate his behavior to even sort of adhere to the most basic social norms, once in a while I just get pissed off, but usually I'm able to avoid it.

Speaker 1:          00:04:22       Well, you shouldn't even once in a while, look, first of all, you got to realize that an anonymity is a really confusing thing for people, right? It's the ability to communicate with people. Anonymous has never existed before, right? Other than some serial killer, making some note by cutting out little pieces of paper or the newspaper and you know, using the words from that, there's no anonymity man. It doesn't. It doesn't exist. Right? So when you have anonymity in the form of like you have a twitter account and it's just an egg and you call yourself fuck mcgee and you just start trolling. The Godfather makes no sense. It's, well it's, you know, that's not a normal interaction. It's the, there shouldn't be a method or someone could just contact you like that because our, our bodies and our minds and our, all our systems, our social systems, they're just not set up for that.

Speaker 1:          00:05:14       So it's, it's saying rude things without consequence, you're, you're basically, you're offering, by the way, an evolutionary argument. Yes, that's exactly right. But it's a completely new thing that we really just don't have the mechanisms for which we're not. We're not accustomed to it. We don't really have a long history of it. I mean we have a history of just doing this. The realistic history at the extreme level is 20 years, 94 dash 96 ish, somewhere around then when it started. Right. But the real history is probably less than 10 of it really being incredibly pervasive the way it is today. Like with twitter and facebook and all this instagram comments and things along those lines. Go ahead. No, no. I was just saying it's, it's a new thing that we have to work out because it is a massive, massive part of our culture.

Speaker 1:          00:06:01       There was some statistic recently about the amount of data that people produce in a day worldwide and the most of the data is lol fuck you, you know, bullshit. But it is ones and zero's, binary code, it's all, all that data. There's more produced in a day, then it's some staggering statistics than the rest of human history. It's something crazy. You hear it. Here it goes every day, two point five quintillion bytes of data created daily. What in the fuck is that? Ninety percent of the world's data today has been created in the last two years alone. Wow. By the way, a lot of business schools now have programs and data analytics or big data where they try to teach students how to navigate through the complexity of this type of big data sets. So it's a really hot field in business schools. Well, it's impossible. I mean the real navigate, I mean what, what it is, is there's a pattern, a very clear pattern emerging and that pattern is of anyone being able to access any information at any time and it's getting closer and closer to that all the time and some of that means communication doesn't just mean being able to access, you know, googling some facts or some, some knowledge.

Speaker 1:          00:07:27       It also, it's being able to communicate with people. Right. And it's got. It's gotten to this really crazy place. Speaking of Information, my doctoral dissertation more than 20 years ago was about how do people decide when to stop acquiring additional information and commit to a choice. So I suppose I'm choosing between cars or between mates or between job applicants or between jobs to take whatever the decision is. You just say between mates mates. Yeah know. So you've got like a gang of bitches for the. You should see. I did. I did look at some of the comments right after I appeared. Right then I lose interest in. I don't, but there was one guy who wrote something like, this guy is swimming in pussy. Well, and then everybody starts ganging up on that comment. So you know what it is, man, it's a beer commercial.

Speaker 1:          00:08:17       The most interesting man in the world is that I looked like what it is like that look like it's become a thing now, you know, got the beautiful white beard and a man of wisdom and years of. Thank you. Uh, so anyway, so in that, in my doctoral dissertation I had looked at, well I think I'm better looking at this guy knew that, you know, that guy's Canadian too. Has He? He's not even really Spanish and he's much older than me. Do you think so? What do you mean? Yeah, I think so. He's like 70, 51. I don't know how old the guy goes. Yeah. So anyways, so, so, so the whole psychology of decision making, I've, I've addressed that in my research. Very interesting stuff. Yeah. Well what is the. Well this is a different sort of a decision making thing because I, I think you, you definitely can get lost where you can just go online and you know, one of the things that youtube does now that makes it really difficult is you watch a video.

Speaker 1:          00:09:12       So if I was watching some video today on a rhino slamming into a car, it was, it was removed though some copyright infringement. It's fucking crazy. This rhino charge this car and slams into it. The problem is once you watch a video, immediately after that it offers up another video and it starts playing, it'll give you like 10 seconds and then it starts playing again and then you look on the side and there's all these suggestions. It's not as simple as one video. It's an endless web. That's why by the way, Internet pornography for men, it's such an alluring trap, right? Because our visual system and our need for variety seeking is there and now you mean I can say she ate this by going online, having endless different new bile ready to meet women. So it's easy for our computational system to be personalized by, by the Internet.

Speaker 1:          00:10:07       Well, it's also, it's probably really not. We're not really set up to watch people. Fuck, you know, it seems like the brain just doesn't know what to do with, you know, especially if you're by yourself close the door, what's going on here? Yeah, I mean there's people that just will watch pornography 10, 12 hours a day and it's not just a few. I bet if you could highlight, I bet if you were in a plane and you're flying over the United States and there was a light bulb that went off over everyone's head that jerks off 12 hours a day, you can be done. You'd be stunned. He'd be able to read by. You'd be able to hold a magazine up to the window and read. I, I'm not joking. I think. I think there's a lot of people out there that get it. They get overwhelmed by the possibilities of doing that.

Speaker 1:          00:10:52       Like the the choice. Yeah, it's they don't have the discipline to handle that and I was actually a conversation that I was having with my friend Duncan the other day about discipline and how important discipline is to living a good healthy life and that getting the things that you need to get done will allow you to actually enjoy your free time. Whereas if you don't get those things done, the free time in those pursuits, these things, they almost become obsessions and you, you kind of dive into them to avoid the pressure of getting those things done and it becomes sort of counterintuitive. I counterproductive. Yeah. Going back to the pornography I had on my youtube channel, a genuine Mercedes careeredge sure. Yeah. I've met her. Have you? Yeah, yeah, yeah. She came to one of my shows with a, I guess I guess her husband or boyfriend or something like that.

Speaker 1:          00:11:39       Very nice guy. He's very smart girl, but I'd seen her on, um, Gavin McInnes his podcasts and she's very smart. She, well, of course otherwise. I mean, what would we have to talk about? Right. She's an engineer's an engineer. She's very, very heavily vested into the whole social justice warrior bullshit and the other way we were fighting against. Exactly. So I'd seen her on a few, you know, popular podcasts and I thought, I mean she's just normally sheep, of course. Beautiful. But so well spoken and so I had her on the show and we've communicated since several time and so that's been really fun. I mean when, I mean sort of to mimic what you do with your podcast of bringing in so many interesting people and my youtube channel, I've had people from guys who fight Islam to porn stars who used to be former engineers, so it's been really fun to meet all these people.

Speaker 1:          00:12:30       Yeah. There's a cool movement going on now where there's a lot of very intelligent people that are resisting nonsense where they're just going to come on, you're wasting time, you're wasting effort. And also there's a lot of people that are attaching themselves to these ridiculous movements just because they have an identity in that movement and then they. They filled the void. Whatever social void they have in their life with this new thing, this new being an sjw. I'm a social justice warrior. There was an article recently about Yale, about students at Yale having a hard time balancing out their social responsibilities with. I'm like, what fucking activism? This is an activity. You're just holding up signs and complaining, right? I mean, this isn't, does not activism. You're not. You're not changing a goddamn thing other than people's opinions about you. Have you seen the one with the site?

Speaker 1:          00:13:20       I did a lecture at University of Ottawa on the thought police and political correctness. I'm not. I'm not sure if you saw it, if not, you know. Yeah. It's really, it kind of covers the, the safe spaces at the microaggressions and the, the trigger warnings. And one of the examples that I picked, I really tried to pick some really outlandish examples that should only belong in the onion. One of the examples was some, I think it was some students at University of Oregon wanted to take down the classic quote by Martin Luther King, you know, the, I have a dream stuff. Yes. Because it was insufficiently inclusive by him, you know, focusing his Ayer on racism and not looking at whatever it is, transgenderism and so on. Uh, he was, he was being divisive. So when Martin Luther King can draw the ire of these guys, none of us are safe. No one is safe.

Speaker 1:          00:14:14       Yeah. Well, they're not safe either. I mean they're eating themselves, they're attacking ourselves. We had this a podcast where we went over the story about this woman who joined Wellesley College, which is an all girls college I've spoken. I've spoken there. You Do, you know the story, but the woman joined Wellesley college and then once you joined the Wellesley College, she decided that she's going to identify as a man masculine of center, Gender Queer is what? Her distinction. Your stick on it cracked egg up in my house. I was crying, laughing. I was screaming, laughing because then she voted to be. She wanted to be the head person of diversity, Chairman Deborah, whatever the fuck

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       this the title was, but it had something to do with diversity and they were boycotting her because now she was a white man. Like this is glorious. This is glorious there. They're literally eating themselves. They're. They're so ridiculous. They've spun around in circles and they're biting their own assets. It's what's going on, but I. I truly feel though that they've sort of reached a zenith and it's going to start decaying. No, it's crazy that he's going to get worse, crazier and crazier, and then there's going to be. There's a culture war, right? Yeah. I don't think they've stopped. I don't even think they've started. I think they're just there right now. Scrambling. I think they don't. They don't hold weight amongst rational people anymore, but that's not gonna stop their movement. Their movement will continue to be irrational at a frenzied pace and they were literally going to cannibalize each other.

Speaker 2:          00:15:39       So what do you think is the end trajectory? I mean at some point it has to crash, right? Well, it's gonna like it's almost like a civil war, right? It's almost like a preposterous civil war. Like I think in a sense our politics in this country have always been a civil war just by nature of having only two choices just by the dual party system in this ridiculous idea that there's independent parties. They're, they're, they're not, they're not independent. Unless trump decided to go independent, he's going to win. You think is going to win the to win? Yeah. He's gonna win to Hidden Hillary. Can't beat him. I don't think she could beat him. I, I would like to see Bernie Sanders when not, not because of his financial policies, which I think are ridiculous, but I think his social policies are interesting and what I should clarify this is, well, here's what's ridiculous about his financial policies.

Speaker 2:          00:16:27       Don't make more taxes because more taxes just means more government, more government is not when we fucking need right now. If you want to organize charitable institutions that will legitimately help people and have people donate money and have people work towards, uh, you know, like these donations will actually take away from your taxes. Let's quit. Let's figure out some way where we make it beneficial for people to be charitable where we set up community programs. It takes some of the money that we're spending on shit that we really don't need to spend money on, some subsidies that we probably don't need that there are benefiting gigantic corporations and instead use those to help the education systems in poor communities. Use those to try to provide jobs and industry and poor communities. That's. These are all really good ideas. So I'm, I'm in favor of that kind of socialism.

Speaker 2:          00:17:14       I'm absolutely in favor of free universities, right? I don't think that people should get out of school and be a quarter million dollars in debt. I think that's madness. I think if you're going to make $50,000 a year, okay, if you've got a really good job, you make $50,000 a year, right? You get out of school, if you, if you could ask school and you make 50 grand a year, you're fucking kicking ass, right? Everything is going great for you. You're not really making 50 grand. You make it about 34, right? And then you've got taxes, you got sales taxes. If you live in a place like California, you've got state taxes, so you're living off of somewhere in the late twenties, thirties, something like that. And you've got $250,000 of debt you've got to deal with. And you've studied women's studies, which is a very actionable, a set of skills.

Speaker 2:          00:17:58       Well, how many people study that? Wellesley? There's a couple. I mean, there's, I just think that it's an insane burden to put on young people, to have them enter into the free market, enter into the world and be already saddled down by insane amounts of debt. I think there's gotta be a way around that and I don't think that it's a terrible idea to have publicly funded universities. I just don't think it's a terrible idea. I don't think it's an insurmountable idea. So I like Bernie Sanders and a lot of ways. I think he's a compassionate guy. I think he's an open minded guy. I think he says a lot of really radical things. I love the fact that he goes out on a limb with this black lives matter stuff. I've liked that he's making a big deal about these cops shooting these young black kids and then it's got to fucking stop.

Speaker 2:          00:18:44       It's gotTa stop. It's madness. How many videos have to come out before you after a while you're like, well, there's obviously some clear problem. How is, how is trump not handling this? How is Hillary not handling this? Like, this is a real problem in our culture, in our society, there's a divisiveness, there's this separation between these people that live in these communities that are terrified of the police and they're really worried about being shot all the time and then everybody else is on the outside looking in and saying, well, if you just follow the law, you wouldn't have those problems. Like, well, try being born there, try being raised there. These are, these are not. We're not on an even playing field. You know, and I think he's one of the few guys that's addressing this imbalance, this social imbalance is cultural imbalance. This is economic imbalance that we have in this country in a really radical way.

Speaker 2:          00:19:35       So I liked him for that. I think that would be a good thing for this country. For a guy like that, you know, would just, would it, would it really happen? I don't know. I mean I take him over the others, I'd take him over the other ones, I think trump is just, he says too much crazy shit. This shit he said about Mexico, like they're going to pay for that wall, and they called me up and they said, what do you think about this and how could you say that? You know what? The Wall just got 10 feet higher. That's not what we need. I mean, he's not very presidential in his, uh, oh man. His mannerisms, you know, I think he's a real successful guy and I think what he's doing is he's tapping into this real frustration that a lot of people have and that's, there's a lot of people that don't like the bullshit that's involved in politics or people aren't seeing what they're really think.

Speaker 2:          00:20:22       So here's this guy who comes along, he doesn't need anybody's money. He's insanely wealthy. Yeah. He's a multibillionaire. And he could say whatever the fuck he wants. And he's used to say whatever the fuck he wants. And every time he does it, people cheer. So that's good too. It's good too because finally we've got. It's almost like we've got an insane Ross Perot. Remember Ross Perot, Ross Perot fucked up the election for Georgia to, with the big ears. He fucked it up for George Bush's Dad. Yeah. The older Bush, you know, they, they slated him for a second term. A lot of people thought he was going to. When Ross Perot came along and explained on television, he bought a half an hour prime time tv Pre-internet, ladies and gentlemen. He bought a half an hour prime time TV and explained to the Federal Reserve to people and explain how you're getting fucked. And I remember there was no internet back then.

Speaker 2:          00:21:10       So I remember me and some friends we got together afterwards and we were, we were going, did you fucking see you then? Like, is that right? Is what he's seeing true. I kind of had to make any sense. And then he was talking about how his children were being threatened and he was worried they were going to get kidnapped. There's all this crazy shit and it got me down a lot of rabbit holes, you know, like conspiracy theory, rabbit holes, watching that guy do that. But I think that what Donald Trump is, is like a more rabid informed version of that and more informed, meaning our culture is more informed, more. I mean, you know, we're, we're hearing the, the age of the Internet where it's, if you go up on television, say something about the Federal Reserve, people understand that you're talking about an insane institution now. Whereas back then people are like, what? What is he saying? The Federal Reserve is not a part of the government, you know, like nobody knew that. Nobody knew that federal bank was it. Why is it called a Federal Bank of. It's not federal, you know, it's so confusing. You know, I think

Speaker 1:          00:22:09       the main thing about trump that people are tapping into is rightly or wrongly, that he comes across as authentic. So if you look on the, on some metric of authenticity between Hillary, Hillary Clinton could not be any more inauthentic, right? I mean, she, she, she freaks you out, right? She, she spooky in her inability to convey, even if she tried to fake genuine emotions. Whereas on the other hand, uh, whether you like him or don't, trump seems to speak from the heart to the extent that a lot of people are disillusioned with politicians. Then this guy comes along and I can at least tap into that and, and hang on that element of his personality. So I think that's what explains his success. Yeah. And also white men, meaning, yeah, there's a lot of white men out there excited to have this, this really bold white man as a contrast effect.

Speaker 1:          00:23:01       You mean to, to Obama? Yeah. As a contrast to Obama. Definitely a contrast to Hillary and Bernie Sanders is chumming up with the black folks, you know. Have you seen, have you followed our politics in Canada? Yeah. You're trudeau guy. I like that guy. You do? I do. I liked that guy because he's young and he seemed smart and he has nice hair. He's got beautiful hair. He, he boxed. He did do that. But what's bad about them? Uh, to the extent that I think we both despise social justice warriors, the ostrich brigade, the regressive left explained the ostrich burger is a term that I popularized, which basically refers to folks who have their head in the sand so that they can't really, except some of the most basic regularities in the world, right? Uh, you know, there is no link between Islam and any terrorist act anywhere in the world to suggest otherwise it'd be Islamophobia.

Speaker 1:          00:23:58       Exactly. So somebody who, who exhibits this type of behavior as a, as an exhibiting ostrich logic, right? So Justin Trudeau is the kingpin of the Ostrich Brigade. Dammit. Yeah. Handsome. So he, he, he basically his dad, his dad instituted as part of our Canadian he multiculturalism. Multiculturalism means two different things. Multiculturalism. When it's used in everyday language, it means that many cultures, right? La is multicultural, meaning it's pluralistic, but multiculturalism as a political philosophy is actually a very dangerous idea, right? It basically says that when immigrants come into your land, they don't have to assimilate within your cultural values. Rather, you allow everybody to get ghettoize because who are we to judge the values of another ghettoized? Yeah. Like you mean like a Dominican community? The Muslims are here to. North Korea is on here here, but ghettos like poor. No, no, no, no. Ghettoize in the sense that everybody who is of the same background lives in that space.

Speaker 1:          00:25:04       It doesn't, that's not a ghetto. I mean the term is used in different ways. It's not ghetto in the, in the sense of hip hop gets zero. A term ghetto. Yeah. What does that mean? Because I've always, I mean, I'm just saying ghetto in this country is always referred to as a poor community. Uh, no, I think it has a broader meaning at least as I understand that. So for example, if you say you'll get to realizing people into different areas of the city. I've never even heard it as a verb. Well, that's why I'm here to get toe eyes. There you go. Yeah. Here we go. New immigrants still tended to get a wise in the cities. Is that. I mean it's exactly what I just defined. Yeah. What's the origin of ghetto a? I don't know that it. Is it, is it actually based on the word ghetto, I'm guessing?

Speaker 1:          00:25:52       Or is it totally. Is it like. No, I like read, read, brace yourself folks. I'm going to say a word that's confusing. Niggardly and it has nothing to do with the n word. Yes. It has to do with like find the origins of that word because I think it has to do. It's, it's about being miserly or cheap. Yes. But it has nothing to do with black history whatsoever. Reluctant to give or spend stingy and miserly. Um, and the origin. What's the origin of it? Whereas this say, does it say no? Doesn't have an origin. But let me, if I could finish my point about Jessica, please do. So. Uh, so Justin Trudeau, at one point when he was a member of parliament, someone had said that things like a fem female genital mutilation

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       and child brides and honored killings was the type of barbers and that we don't need in Canada. And Justin Trudeau's position at the time was, how dare you use the word barbarism and describing other people's cultures. Right? So he wasn't offended by having women's clitoral says cut. He was offended by people who describe that behavior as barbaric. So he is the king of the ostriches. So he's not a fan of the godfathers. Oh No. Or I'm not a fan of his rather. Oh, Canada. Have you followed some of our debates regarding, uh, allowing the, a sort of open. Well, not the open door, but allowing massive number of Syrian immigrants. No, I haven't followed. You see what's going on in other countries. So of course in Europe they look at our issue and they sort of say, come on, are you serious? We have 800,000 migrants coming through to Germany.

Speaker 3:          00:27:43       You're complaining about 25,000, but we'll look what happened with Cologne. Yeah. Because the mayor of Cologne, after these attacks on New Year's Eve was telling women to dress difference. Right? And stay away from men hostage brigade. That's fucking insane. I mean that that is a very culturally diverse area that has existed in a very peaceful way for a long time until all the sudden they let in all these immigrants and they're having a massive problem with women being sexually assaulted. So instead of protecting these women and trying to do their best to ramp up the police force or do something to stop it or make sure that people are safe or really put it, put it out there that look, you're in a new fucking place and if you want to simulate in our culture, you've got, leave these fucking women alone or we're going to get rid of you.

Speaker 3:          00:28:26       Everyone who does anything to women in our country, we're going to get rid of you. You can't be here and make people feel unsafe instead of doing that. But see, that's so one of the reasons why I'm very concerned about the $25,000 coming in and people say, well come on. How many of them are likely to be Isis members? But the danger is not only people only think of Isis members is the danger. Right? But when you've got 25,000 people, of whom a very large majority will adhere to certain values that are perfectly antithetical to ours. Right. What are your views on homosexuals? What are your views on religious minorities and Jews? If we live in 25,000 Syrians at statistically speaking, will they are the more likely or less likely that they'd be antisemitism? I mean that's an empirical statement that we could test, right? So it's not only about the fact that how many of these 25,000 are isis members, it's how many of these 25,000 people will hold values that are perfectly congruent with ours. And so we have every right. Without having the threat of being called racist and Islamophobia over our head to engage in a discussion on how do we vet these people? I mean, how do you find out what percentage of those are going to hold views that are grotesque to us

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       and then should we be letting them in, but what are the. What are the options mean? What? How could you possibly find out what their views are? You would have to sit down with each one individually and quiz them, and then you would have to verify their claims or their answers. Well, at the very least, I would argue that you should never be allowed under the guise of your religious practice to a spouse, you know, hateful things, right? I mean, uh, if, if you go to a house of worship and that house of worship is praising certain things that you and I would consider genocidal hatred, then my right to be free of the genocidal hatred that's coming my way supersedes your right to practice your religion of genocidally hating me. Right? So that, that's simply has to be the rule. And if we don't wake up to that reality, we're going to have problems.

Speaker 1:          00:30:41       Yeah, I would say that that's a very reasonable statement and I think that there's a lot of people in this country that liked to say things like what you were claiming. Trudeau said about culture. Like how dare you criticize their culture. Their culture is a bullshit word. It's human behavior and you're looking at human behavior. Some human behavior is acceptable, is not, and if it's acceptable in other countries to eat people, guess what? It's not acceptable here. You can't cook people, you can't eat them. We don't allow it. Right. Well, I'll let me, let me add to that. The part of multiculturalism is this idea that all cultures are unique, distinct and equal in their own right, and actually that is a truly profoundly incorrect statements. Cultures are not equal, but different cultures are differentially able to engender happiness to more or less people, right?

Speaker 1:          00:31:32       Yeah. So, so if you are part of whatever it means, Tali bond culture, you couldn't on average predict that women in that culture will be less self-actualized than in western countries. That isn't empirically demonstrable fact. Yes, and so the idea that who are we to judge other cultures, this idea of cultural relativism which has part which is endemic of multiculturalism, is profoundly incorrect and it has to go well. It's a, it's a blind statement. It's not a real. It's not a real statement. You can't really say that. It's not. I mean, you could look at it economically, you could look at it socially, you look at in terms of, you know, there's a real good argument that in this country there's less free freedom and there is another country's because more people are in jail, right? You could look at it that way. You can look at the disproportionate amount of people that are in jail for nonviolent drug offenses in this country and say, well, this country is obviously a fucked up place, and that's, um, that's a legit claim as well. But the idea of numerical value equal making it equal, we're all cultures are equal. That's foolishness. That's not true. Not only that, there's a very real thing going in the world

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       where as the age of information washes upon us, and I think this is the new age of information that the age of pure information as this wash is upon us. We're seeing massive changes in our own country and we're seeing massive changes in our political system. We're seeing massive changes socially. And I think this is social justice warrior thing is sort of a side effect of that were these disenfranchised people than some of them may be mentally ill. They have a voice, you know, some of them, oh, let's not say ill imbalanced. Maybe they're radical because they're young and idealist and they haven't looked at all the right ways. And then one day they'll balance out like many people have as many young radicals. It'd become very rational people in their fifties and sixties and whatever. But this, this thing is taking place here. And it's also taking place all over the world.

Speaker 2:          00:33:32       Well, where information is being resisted. That's where we have problems in the world, right? Where fundamental religious values are superseding the age of information there. They're squashing people's ability to express themselves, people's ability to try new things, exploring new things, um, their sexual values, their, their, their identities, all those things. Like, as soon as you have like an ancient fucking scripture, some shit that was written on animal skins a thousand years ago. Like as soon as that is, is at the head. And that takes precedent over everything else because it was supposedly the word of God or who else? Someone who talked to God, whatever the fuck it is that you've got a problem, a real problem there because religion, religion in and of itself is an idea and it's an idea that is the only one of the very few ideas that we accept that literally has no basis in reality.

Speaker 2:          00:34:32       There's no bay. It has no basis. In fact, it has no basis in anything provable. And that's why we have this concept of faith. Well, as soon as you have religion that's dominating information you have, you have a problem, you've got a bottleneck. You got to put up a wall that's put up for progress. Now when people develop in that environment, you have stifled people just like I have a friend and him and his wife, they were Mormons until they were like 40. And then they decided to slowly. They literally lived overseas for a bit and they kind of experienced the world and they, oh, it opened their eyes to a lot of different things and they decided to move away from the church. They're fucking lost, man. They're lost. Like, they're almost like grownup children. I think you might've told me. They're wonderful people. They're great people, but the wife is really interesting. She's very self aware and she even talks about it. She says, I growing up in this really fundamentalist religion, I think I developed a really bad way of looking at things

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       where I'm easily confused, easily confused and easily lead, right? Like with like a charlatan could, could take her over or uh, a cult member could. Chapter eight of the book I just gave you, it's called marketing hope by selling lies. And basically what I argued there is that they are different peddlers of hope that are successful precisely because they could sell you hope and the areas that are most important in sort of Darwinian insecurities right now to be a better lover. How to live forever to be a better parent. Right? Right. So, so all of the key Darwinian pursuits that keep us and keep us up at night, there is a peddler out there who can give you the recipe, whether he be a self help guru, whether he be a medical quack, whether he be religion, and so that's why those products are so successful because they peddle us hope.

Speaker 1:          00:36:28       Yes, but growing up in with religion, especially fundamentalist religion that cannot be questioned, it becomes a real problem because there's these rigid areas where you're only allowed to think one way right now. You develop these patterns in your mind. Then when you move to a new place, it doesn't support those ideas and you want to use genital mutilation. You want to wrap women up and fucking mummy cloth and make sure they can't drive like you want to do that same shit in Canada that you're doing in Saudi Arabia, you got real fucking problem. That's a real problem. And Justin Trudeau would say, who are we to judge their practices? Whereas what you're saying is you're against multiculturalism because you are taking a position against it. So you don't like Justin Trudeau. Well, I'm definitely not against multiculturalism. I'm against, I'm against religious fundamentalism on a, on a global scale because I'm not against God and this is what people have to understand.

Speaker 1:          00:37:21       Like I would be the last person to tell you I have any idea about something that I have never experienced. What I've experienced is the afterlife. I have never. I am open to the idea that this life is one stage and an infinite fractal, like a gigantic, infinite number of experiences that are our energy can, can go through, answer Jack. Could that simply be the fact that you are finding an alternate way, not through religion, but through some alternate means to live on forever? Well, exactly right now, so I could. I could take this pill called religion that will grant me a mortality or I could do your fractal Mumbo jumbo stuff and it's no disrespect and that could still get me through it. Whereas the reality of the intellectually honest position is that we really have absolutely no evidence. This is a very small party that will last if you're lucky, 85 years and it's profoundly fear inducing because I want to be coming back on this podcast for the next 4,000 years, but I. It really worries me that I won't, but it's honest. It's honest. To know that you've got 85 years in a sense it's

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       liberating because it forces me and you. If you're an atheist to really carpet dm at right, you really have to seize the day because there are no do overs, there is no eternity, there is no afterlife. It's all right here. What we do, and so in a sense there is a a glory to the finiteness that is afforded by atheism. You can certainly look at it that way. My, my perspective though is that we really just don't know and that energy continues to move forward in a lot of different ways. We see this throughout all of nature. Whereas things die. They get reabsorbed into the ground. The very energy and the essence that they had when they were alive fuels all these different microbes and bacteria and the ground that it makes. The soil richer, grows more plants. Animals eat those plants that nourishes them.

Speaker 2:          00:39:26       They all, they literally the cells and the carbon from every fucking human being on this planet came from a star that exploded. Death becomes life and some sort of strange way, but I don't think that it's impossible that that could be the same thing with consciousness, with energy, with, with whatever the fuck it is inside of us that makes us alive and aware and makes our minds tune in to all of the possibilities in the wonders of the world. I don't know if this is the end, but you don't either. I don't. Well, no one does, right? That's the point. And then as soon as someone comes along and tells you, they do know, and this is the only way to the afterlife, this is the only way to heaven. You got a real problem. You got a real problem because human beings are malleable and you can guide them and you can direct them and you can mold them and you could turn them into religious slaves.

Speaker 2:          00:40:13       You could turn them into ideological slaves and we should recognize that from a psychological perspective, from an educated perspective, from a perspective of recognizing cult behavioral. I was watching this thing on this guy, Steve Hassan, the guy who was on our podcast before was a cult expert. He sent me an email today and I watched this, this piece on on cults and cult behavior and cults on the Internet and it's so fucking. It's terrifying how malleable people's minds are and how someone who's an unscrupulous person or unscrupulous person or someone who has nefarious ideas can convince people to blow themselves up to get virgins in the afterlife. I mean, that's a reality. Very earthly Darwinian things in her life, right? Well, it's the people don't know and that's my point and when someone comes along and says, I do know and this is the truth, it becomes a real problem because you can't fucking prove it.

Speaker 2:          00:41:07       You can't prove it. You don't have any facts, you don't have any data. There's nothing you can measure. There's nothing you could way and you're not saying you think you're saying, you know, and if you think one thing, if you think, I think this is it, Carpe Diem, live for the day. This is our only shot here. You might be right, or this guy who's done a fucking pound of mushrooms might've come back from the other side and say, listen, I have this idea and I think that love is eternal and it goes on forever, and then what we really are

Speaker 1:          00:41:33       here we are this being that's trying to figure itself out in this very brief amount of time and the best we can do is leave behind information. We have this wonderful thing called communication and language. We store this information. The next generation comes along and tries to pick up where the last generation left off, gather up as much data as they can and then move it forward a little bit before they expire and we keep doing it and doing it and doing it and doing it until hopefully we move towards some level of enlightenment as a species. See, I can. I can repackage that in slightly more earthly and less esoteric terms. I think that we can achieve immortality and quilts in two ways, right through genetic propagation. That's why you and I have children. I mean literally we are extending our genes and also through mimetic propagation and mimetic propagation is, you know, you read this book and now infects your brains.

Speaker 1:          00:42:26       I'm not reading it now. You're not effecting me man. By the way, next time I come, there's a 100 percent final exam on this book. So you better professor made exams right here, like a cheat sheet or so. So I'm the medic. Propagation is basically anything that can be part if you like, of your legacy. Right? So the collection of stuff that people can go and and watch about you as part of Joe Rogan's, mimetic propagation and long after you may be gone, people will be able to consume Joe Rogan's ideas and all of the wonderful things that he's done for many, many years to come. And so in that sense, I think either through genetic propagation or mimetic propagation, we, we can be immortal and that's why it is really important to do all the wonderful things that people do. Because that is your ticket to immortality.

Speaker 1:          00:43:13       I don't. I mean, again, you might say, well, how do you know? I don't know, but until I have any evidence of otherwise, I'm going to take the intellectually honest position and say the party is going to end. Well, it really, let's get further than that because immortality is nonsense. This fucking son doesn't have an immortal life. Yeah, we got it for 4 billion years, right? If we're lucky, and that's assuming that we don't get hit by one of these gigantic fucking rocks and keeps flying around. You hear about that one that went off over the Atlantic Ocean the other day? No. Oh my God. The fucking media exploded over the Atlantic Ocean. Nobody knew about it. Nobody heard about it. Nobody knew is coming. Will pull this up, Jamie, because the amount of energy. So if we hit, let's say New York, what would have happened? Everyone like Hiroshima, bigger than here.

Speaker 1:          00:44:02       Here it is, a media exposure over the Atlantic. Like pull up the amount of power that had had. I had it on my, um, I had it on my twitter where it talked about in relationship to a Hiroshima, like how big of it was, um, due to do 500,000 tons of TNT. Jesus fucking Christ. It's insane. That was the one over Russia. Oh, this is what the one who thousand tons of TNT. Okay. Oh, the Russian one I remember from a few years ago. Yes. But what's the, what's the Atlantic Ocean one will pull up the one that compared it to a pull up the article that I had on my, um, on my twitter because it's, it compared it to a, a nuclear bomb.

Speaker 1:          00:44:49       Wow, yeah, well these are really common, you know, and I had this guy, Randall Carlson on the podcast a few times and he's dedicated his life to paying attention to the signs of asteroidal impacts all throughout history and all throughout the world. And astronomer. Yeah, and he believes that what's happened is all throughout human history, there's been these resets where people accumulated a lot of data, they learned a lot, society move forward and then boom, we got hit and then a lot of people died and then they had to regroup, start all over again. And there's a lot of evidence in the physical form. This stuff called [inaudible], I think it's called Triton night. It's called new, its nuclear glass, they call it. It's the same substance that they find when they do nuclear tests in the desert and stuff and they found it all throughout Europe and Asia and they find it when they do core samples between like 10 and 12,000 years.

Speaker 1:          00:45:39       So it's exactly the same time as the end of the ice age coincides with the end of the ice age and with these these like puzzling moments in civilization where you have, they'll find things like go Beckley tappy, these beautiful structures that are really complex that are 14,000 years old, 12,000 years old. They're like, who the fuck was building this stuff back then when we thought people were hunter gatherers and then right after that, boom, we get hit by rocks. Most people die, a lot of people die and then they have to regroup again. And I think that that that's most likely going to be the end of humanity just like it was the end of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. It's much more common then we would then we really would like to think about. So definitely don't sweat it. Don't sweat the small stuff. Yeah. There's no and mortality as far as this dimension.

Speaker 1:          00:46:31       It's just, it's not gonna happen. So if you want to, you want me to tell you a bit about the evolutionary roots of religion, how, how you would study religion as an evolutionist. Okay. You Ready? Yeah. So one argument is based on, it's an adaptive argument, right? So the idea is if religion exists, does that confer an adaptive advantage to people? And so there was some work done by a good friend of Mine, David Wilson and evolutionary biologist where he argues using a group selection, it's argument that that groups that are religious out survive groups that are not by virtue of them being more communal, more cohesive, more abandoned. So that argument is an adaptive argument for why religion exists. There's another argument by other evolutionists that is based on an exaltation arguing. Have you ever heard that term except acceptation. What does that mean? So that's a byproduct of evolution.

Speaker 1:          00:47:23       In other words, it's something that evolved not because itself, it confers an adaptive advantage. Rather it's piggybacking. So for example, the fact that your skeletal system is the color that it is, that itself is not adaptive. It is a byproduct of other evolutionary processes. So from that perspective, religion piggybacks on computational systems in our brains that evolved for other things. You follow me, for example, coalitional thinking, the idea of viewing the world as US versus them, blue team versus red team. That is an innate part of our psychology now. Now religion piggybacks on that, right? It takes that computational system that already exists in us and it, it puts it on steroids, right? So you think about the Abrahamic religions, right? Every one of them has us versus them. They are the Jews, the gentiles, the believers, the preferred, right? And so at agency detection, detecting agency and things is something that is innate to us.

Speaker 1:          00:48:19       Religion plays on that. The agent becomes God, and so that's an argument that was proposed by Pascal where he's basically saying that religion did not specifically evolve because itself self, it is adaptive, but it piggybacks on other things that have evolved. And then a third way to study religion is to just do a content analysis of the the, the narratives within religions. So there's a great study done by a Darwinian historian where she looked at in the old testament how many women are ascribed to a different male in the old testament as a function of a status. So the higher the status of the male, the more sexual partners you had, which is exactly what you would predict from an evolutionary perspective. High status to men confers reproductive success. So there are different ways that evolution is. And there are several other ways that can study religion from an evolutionary perspective.

Speaker 1:          00:49:16       That's pretty fascinating. Well, I also think that we've always, as cultures have sort of tried to stay alive and have tried to maintain order. We've always tried to establish sets of rules and boundaries and things and it only makes sense that you would say, hey, you know, there's a real reason why you can't kill people. And it's not because it makes everybody upset. It's because you're gonna go to hell, right? So listen, you don't want to go to hell. So don't kill people. All these, all these things that people have done throughout history. I mean, if you look at religion on a global scale, there are some key components to almost all religions and those seem to. They seem to benefit order. They seem to benefit culture and like you were saying that the idea of people living longer and being more successful as a. As a culture, yeah, we'll senses of community. If you have a sense of community, if you, if you established community and establish a bond between people and a higher good or a higher reason to exist. I'll give you another example. A kosher laws actually have discussed this in this book, right? So I try to offer a biological

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       explanation that is not rooted in religious narratives for why kosher laws would have evolved. Right? So think about the kosher edict that you shouldn't eat shellfish. Well, so I did a lot of research when I was writing the book on this issue. It turns out that when you have shellfish that is infected with a particular pathogen, red tie, that's good. That could kill you, right? Yes. The one that is infected versus the one that is uninformed, not infected. You can't really tell the difference either through smell, either through site, so number one, number two, it's not as though the one that's coming from an infected lives in mercury or water, so there was. There is nothing that you could use in terms of observational learning that can offer you some statistical regularity of if I do a, b will happen once in a while. Somebody eats a shellfish, they dropped that.

Speaker 3:          00:51:22       I don't have a means. I'm thinking as a Bronze Age guy running around the Middle East to ever learn from this mal addiction. Therefore the only thing that I can do is then say it is a edict from God. Boom, don't do it. Of course. So they are very, very easy earthly biological reasons to take food, taboos, religious taboos and demonstrate that they have nothing. But of course when I say this in a classroom where there are people who might otherwise be religious, they see it. Yet they can't completely follow you because. Yeah, yeah. Well, because they have this doctrine in their mind that is just the word of God will also pigs eating pig. Exactly. I mean, we all know that pigs contained trick of gnosis and exactly bears as well, you know, it's supposed to eat bears. There's a lot of reasons why kosher living in, you know, a thousand, 5,000 years ago or whatever was really smart, smart way to go.

Speaker 3:          00:52:13       Have you. Have you ever read. I'm giving him here a, a, a, a, a thumbs up. Maybe it'll help his book. The Paleo manifesto by John Durant. Uh, no I haven't, but John and I have been talking back and forth on twitter and where he's moving here. So when he moves here, he's dead to me. You just said he's moving here. I want to be in southern California. Is that I now see my hair. You were here for like three months, right? Weren't you here for a bunch of money all the time. But if you move here because I need a professorship job here. You're a smart guy selling books. You're doing well. But anyways, and I think in his book he talks about, I don't remember the exact number, but he looked at the 613 commandments in Jewish law and some outlandish number, say something like 20 percent of them deal with purity rituals. And those purity rituals are ultimately means very earthly means to try to remove the possibility that you've been exposed to dangerous pathogens. Right? So again, you see how something that is cloaked and the in the robe of religion is ultimately solving a very basic earthly biological problem. Well also if you talk about

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       sexual promiscuity, right? Controlling that controls sexually transmitted diseases which like syphilis and a lot of the really terminal ones before they had medication for those things, they killed a lot of people. A lot of people died from having sex, which is just a ruthless, cruel thank and you got to assume that that's probably nature. Trying to strike some sort of a balance, right? We don't want to think about it that way, but that's exists all throughout nature. When animals become overpopulated, all of a sudden they start developing diseases and they fall off. I mean that's the rabbit cycle, if you're not aware of people that aren't aware of rabbits go in a seven year cycle, so if you're around and you see a lot of rabbits see rabbits all over the place and then like three years later there's no rabbits. What happens is rabbits get to a high population level and then they'll develop a disease and they die off and then there's only a few rabbits and then it takes seven years until they reach this peak and then they die off again in a natural setting, natural constant seven year cycle to regulate the population of rabbits because we all know that rabbits fuck like rabbits and they, they make a lot of babies and they don't have that.

Speaker 2:          00:54:43       Unfortunately with pigs, pigs are so hardy and so ruthless that they. They will have litters three, four times a year. I think a female pig can have a litter as soon as like, look this up, Jamie, but I want to say it's like within six months, within six months of being born she can give birth, which is crazy, and they can just have piglets three times a year and each time they do it they'll have a bunch of them and they'll just overtake places. They got a problem in San Jose. There was a news story on the other day where these people were in their house and the pigs were knocking over the garbage can and eating up their lawn in a normal residential neighborhood. Like I mean a pretty crowded neighborhood. And these wild pigs are just roaming through the streets now. They're everywhere. Have you.

Speaker 2:          00:55:31       Have you ever heard the term our case selected? Does that ring a bell? Yes, but I don't remember what it means. So basically it's the idea that some species produce many offspring with the hope that very few will survive until sexual maturity alligator frog, right? Many fish pigs, right. Versus a little on that scale, they would be less so versus a elephant. Humans where, you know, the gestational period, the, the, the length of parental investment that is required before you reach sexual maturity as much. So it's either a lot of quantity hoping that if you survive or much less quantitative but heavily parental investment and, and just that right, whether you are a species that is our case, like the, the, the reason for the arcade room doesn't matter, uh, has a profound effect on the evolutionary trajectory

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       of that species. Right? So thanks for example, like a humans are a bike rental species, right? So even though you males invest parentally less than females in the human context, we are really championed that. I mean in the, in the, in the greater context of, of mammals. Human dads are just outlandish, but there's no one like us, nothing like us except for example, penguins. That's of course you're not mammals. So, and the human context then because we are by parental species, you would expect the evolution of a few things. One of which, and I actually recently, I discussed this in one of my lectures because somebody asked that exact question. So the evolution of romantic love is if you like a solution to this very important problem, which is you and I, male, female have to pair bond for a certain period of time. We have to be able to stand one another for a sufficiently large enough period of time to get our child to sexual maturity and hence they are selection pressures for us to evolve the aspect of system that we call romantic love.

Speaker 1:          00:57:28       Uh, so, so this shows you how the pending on the particular history of the species. You get completely different. Interesting trajectories, Dennis. Fascinating. And it completely makes sense if you think about it. And there are certain animals like rats or mice, they're constantly being preyed upon. They have to develop large litters. Right? Here's another one here at coping with feral hogs. Oh, nice. Five and six pigs per litter sounds of approximately one point five liters per year. Yeah. But when, when can they get pregnant? They get to the first litter when they're 13 months of age. It can be sexually mature at six months. What's their life expectancy? That's a good question.

Speaker 1:          00:58:08       I'd say 48 years of age, that's if they don't get killed by a cougar series. Another one. You Ready? Check this out. So if you don't know what sexual dimorphism is. Yes. So right, so humans are sexually dimorphic. But take for example, why don't you explain it to people that don't know. Sorry. Yes. So where, where there is an innate sex difference. Typically we talk about, for example, you're a sexist sex. I realized, you know, sexual dimorphism is just a cultural, it's a cultural construct. It's not real. And I like how you say it with the affectations person. I watch a woman in a video explained that women are not inherently weaker than men and just engage in less strength based activities. I've heard the exact same thing. That's hilarious. Well actually at [inaudible] even been linked to the fact that little boys are encouraged to play rough and tumble, whereas little girls are dissuaded from doing so and that's what sets them on their trajectory. So that Baba who plays center for University of Nebraska can bench press 500 pounds. It's completely social construction has nothing to do with muscle mass. Nothing to do with testosterone, but anyways, so going back to differences across species, so sexual dimorphism species are very sexually

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       dimorphic. See Elephant seals. You have a male who's massive 44 times the size of a female or a mountain gorillas, right? So if you look at the extent to which there is or isn't sexual dimorphism with the species, that itself perfectly predicts the mating system within that species, meaning if there is a huge sexual dimorphism, typically the males are bigger than the females, but sometimes you have sex reversal species. Then you have privilege in this meeting, meaning what one male monopolizes sexual access to many females, and the reason why they develop that size is because that's the combat that they engage in where the winner then gets the genetic lottery, right? On the other hand, when you have species where the two sexes are equal sized, then you have typically monogamous mating, like in the case of some bird species, but even there, by the way, even though they're supposed to be monogamous, once in a while, they go behind the bush. Genetic tests have shown, well, birds are really only male. Penguins are a big one that people bring. Exactly. Throwing monogamous for a year, right? But even even within what you consider to be a monogamist window, there are some tests that show that once in a while we do go behind the bushes, that it's behind. That Bush did not win the game.

Speaker 3:          01:00:40       I tried to, once in a while, uh, use my evolutionary stuff on my wife to explain why it might be okay to do this. She hasn't really bought into the whole thing. Read more, get her head out of the bushes. Exactly sand wherever. By the way, incidentally, this whole idea of taking an evolutionary explanation and then people thinking that that then justifies or condones the behavior as a classic reason why people hate evolutionary psychology, right? So if you explain, you know, here's a, here's an evolutionary explanation for rape, here's an evolution explanation for wild child abuse happens. If there's a step parent in the family, here's why people might have difficulty staying true to their monogamous unions, then people will get very upset at you because they somehow conflate the fact that you are explaining the phenomenon using science as meaning that you are saying it clears your moral judgment and of course it doesn't, but that's one of the places where people get really upset at you and we'll send you hate mail in that moral judgment is also cultural, which gets really strange when you look at certain religions like the Mormons, right?

Speaker 3:          01:01:44       The whole reason why the Mormons a setup this compound in Mexico while they moved to Mexico, is when polygamy was made illegal in the United States. Will we're just going to go to Mexico. And that's where Mitt Romney's family came around. Which is really bizarre. Isn't it amazing how whenever there are these, uh, polygynous rulings from God, it's always that. It's one man with multiple women. It's never been a polyandrous thing. It's never been the other way around. Don't want to get a gang bang. I didn't want a bunch of dudes. You know, there is one place in the world where there is polyandry. Do you know where it is? Somewhere? That sucks. It's called Tibetan. Polyandry told you it's safe. It's fraternal to Beth and polyandry. Eternal. Yeah. Which means b means brothers and sisters. No meaning at a frat together, meaning that the woman who is being shared across many men, those men are brothers.

Speaker 3:          01:02:43       That's crazy. But here's the evolutionary explanation, right? Imagine where you have a system for whatever reason, we're not every man could be mated. That's not a good thing because you have a lot of men who are going to be sexually frustrated, right? China, right? Exactly. You know, so therefore by creating a system where, okay, not everybody could be guaranteed that their reproductive fitness is going to be assured, but at least they're kin selection will be assured. Meaning what? I share half of my genes on average from my brother. So either I will impregnate the woman, in which case great. Or my brother will impregnate her, in which case I'm still indirectly not through direct reproductive fitness, but through kin selection, I'm still extending my jeans. So even in cases where men share a woman, it has to be in the context of all in the family.

Speaker 3:          01:03:33       Whoa, I'm blowing your mind. That's, that's an intense thing and that's. That must be just a reaction to the fact that there is much more men than there are women. And why would that be? Why are there more men than there? So sometimes it could be. That's called by the way and operational sex ratio. If there are imbalances between males and females within a particular niche, sometimes it could be because of certain inheritance structures where it's only the eldest who can have enough money through inheritance so the other guys can't really afford a what. So there are all sorts of institutional reasons beyond sex, racial reasons where some men may otherwise be out of the mating market and we know that societies were. A lot of men are sitting around sexually frustrated is not going to be societies that are conducive to quiet and so therefore.

Speaker 3:          01:04:28       So therefore, even in the context where you have something like polyandry, which is something that typically evolutionary speaking, you wouldn't expect. When it arises, it arises as a response to a real evolutionary problem, so, so every, I mean most things that you could think of ultimately have some evolutionary expansion to them and that's why I fell in love with evolution because the explanatory power that is afforded once you have that key to understand things via evolutionary thinking, it becomes incredibly powerful and once the parameters and the variables change, the behavior changes to adapt to those parameters. Variables. Exactly right. A perfect example that is fighter pilots, fighter pilots are classically wife swappers. Is that true? Yeah. There's a lot of that goes on in those communities because these people

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       are swingers, you mean? Yeah, well sort of. Yeah. Well it's. You know what it is. They know that they're probably going to die and if they love their wife, they want someone else to love their wife as much as they do. And the idea is that if they all just shit like life is, it's different. It's much more fleeting. It's much more fragile than it is in the world of the Accountant, you know? So I think it makes sense that that's very prevalent in those communities. So the, the, the, if you like, the sexual risk taking is a form of insurance policy. Say it like if you, uh, you, you were married and Jamie was married and you were both fighter pilots and uh, you both would do missions together, like an intense bond between you guys and you know, you would just swap wives who would just say, look, you know, the idea is like if you die, if you get shot down and you die, you know, you want your wife to be taken care of by someone who loves her.

Speaker 1:          01:06:10       Right? As long as they had a smaller penis in me, Jamie's got a hog tell you it's got a hard on the kid. But by going, going good luck with that. Going back to, by the way, I'll send you the link to the global, a penis sizes around the world and I'll just point you to where Lebanon scores on that. Whereas how's it go? Pretty good. Top is it, is it like where people are like, we're, there's more danger, dicks or bigger? I've never heard that this is the first time, well isn't been like so danger. One of the most dangerous places, right? They danger and in terms of violence and crime and like, look, if you classically, let's all, let's put away all pretenses of racism. Right? Back. Black guys supposedly have the biggest dicks. Right? Why is that? Do they have um, more athleticism too.

Speaker 1:          01:07:05       That's a lot of things that people connect to it. So drone system scientifically, has that been absolutely proven? You know it. And I let it go. I know that anecdotally we hear that. You're like, no, no, no Lebanese. If you just check it's a Lebanese people know mean it's always know it's a stereotype, but I truly don't know whether it's scientists. I mean there's certain stereotypes that are just, there's a reason there and that's a, that's one that is acceptable when you talk about black people. Yeah. Because it's got the venture that it's complementary. Right, right. Uh, I'll tell you a great story about racial differences. So in 1995, I think it was 1995, [inaudible] 96. I'm giving a talk. So this is shortly after my phd, I just started as a young assistant professor. I'm giving a talk at this big international psychology conference and is maybe a thousand 500 people in this room and that that's quite a big size for academic conference and there's a real buzz in the room as if there's tension and I'm not exactly sure why.

Speaker 1:          01:08:02       They're certainly not 10 set me at that point. I was just a young guy. Nobody knew who the hell I was immediately before I get up to present. So the guy who was immediately before me is a gentleman by the name of Phillip Rushton. Have you ever know, you know him? Phil oppression is a, uh, was he recently passed away. He was a Canadian based psychologist who is probably the preeminent psychologist who studied racial differences and offered evolutionary explanations for why these racial differences might exist. And most notably he had looked at a suppose that racial differences, racial differences in intelligence using a postmortem cranial size. Right. So the fact is that if the carrying capacity cavities bigger or smaller than you assume that that means the person from this race is more intelligent than that race, this controversial research. Very, very spicy research. So anyways, so this guy gets up to present his stuff and he starts putting up slides of black male, black female, white male, white female, and you see the, I mean the crowd is like, you know, sharpening their knives to lynch the sky and I have to get up and present right after him and I'm thinking that just by proxy, just by, by being close to him, I'm going to get killed.

Speaker 1:          01:09:21       Now the good news is that immediately after he finished his presentation, out of the 1,500 people who were there, about 1000, 425 left the room to find him really. So. So there was nearly no one left to listen to my talk. And that was one of the few times where I was actually very pleased to have very few people listening to me. So they left the room. And what do they do that I think they wanted to sort of, uh, you know, challenge him and confront him and so on. Does when a guy does a speech like that, does he allow a question? Answer period is very, very good question. So usually you would leave depending on the size of the. I mean let's say you have 25 minutes, so you might do 20 minutes leaving five minutes for q and a, he went to the last second so that there was no opportunity for questions and then he sort of was whisked out.

Speaker 1:          01:10:10       Uh, and so I was really, really pleased that almost nobody stayed from my talk. What's interesting about that is there a certain truths that you're not allowed to explore and you're not allowed to explore the possibility that some human beings may be not as intelligent as other human beings on an individual level or as a group level. What I was going to. Oh, sorry, go ahead. As on an individual level, we accept that, but on a group level we're not willing to on an individual level, at the individual level, even while they're retarded. I, well that's why it's proof, but, but it's interesting that like there's certain genetic variables that will accept that are a product of the environment in which these people develop. Like for instance, inuits are much more adapted to cold. Their hands don't get numb. They don't get frostbite nearly as easy. They can operate. They have been much better circulation in cold weather and their hands and their feet and let's, because they've been living up there for generation after generation there. There's certain

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       things that we don't accept though and one of the big ones is intelligence. We don't accept that some people could live in a soft world where things are easy and they develop like a slow, lazy mind. Whereas some people develop in a very tricky world with this constant innovation going on and they develop a sharper mind. You know, we, we were, we resist that because we don't want anyone thinking that they're dumber than other people. Right. Well, um, the, the, the point though is that I'm not sure that anybody has offered compelling explanation for why they would be selection pressures in environment a versus environment, be for there to be greater intelligence. So I think there is some evidence that, especially European Jews who have more Nobel prize awards than anyone else. Why do you have to dis me by saying European Jews? Why don't you answer the Arab Jews?

Speaker 3:          01:12:04       Well, it's true though. It's just because you're a very intelligent man, obviously, but I'm neither your, well, I'm sort of European, Italian. Um, you know, there's something fascinating about that to me. And I wonder if that's cultural. I wonder if that's educational. I mean, what, what is that? So, so I can certainly definitively point to the cultural elements, like the genetic element is, is debatable, right? Uh, and so it's neither, yes or no, it's unclear. But the cultural element that I'll share with you a personal anecdote, I don't, I don't think I've ever shared it on the show before or if I have, it's still worth repeating. Uh, after I finished my Mba. I mean, I knew I was going to go on and do my phd and become a professor, but at one point I had a brother who lives in southern California. It was a very successful businessman and I was coming out here to see whether I want it to go and do my phd at Uc Irvine, uh, versus other schools where I had been accepted.

Speaker 3:          01:12:57       And he said, hey, you know what, why don't you put on the proverbial sooth and maybe work with me for a few years before you go on to get your phd. It might be a nice thing for you to get some work experience outside of academia. I wasn't really entertaining it. Buy My mother a herd of this possibility. And so when I went back to Montreal, she, she took me aside to one of the rooms and very, very concerned. She said to me, remember if you, if you don't go on to get your phd, I mean, do you want people to remember you as somebody who's dropped out of school? So from her perspective, from the standards that we're expected, somebody who had, you know, I've got an Undergrad in mathematics and computer science and I've gotten an MBA. Uh, if I stopped at that point, I will drop out. I'm a dropout from school. I have an MBA from a top school right now. Of course I didn't do a phd from my parents' approval, but it just gives you the sense of the type of expectations. Then the, the, the, the imparting of love for learning, for knowledge, for wisdom and achievement and achievement that is inbred in you from the minute you come out of the womb. So whether there is a genetic component or not, I don't know, but I can certainly say that the component is very alluring

Speaker 2:          01:14:13       cultural components. It exists very strongly in the Korean community. It was a good buddy of mine when I was a kid who's Korean, who was on the US national taekwondo team while he was in his residency as a doctor. I mean, he was a fucking animal. This kid, I mean, he, I've never met anybody who worked harder. He slept like three or four hours a night. He was always exhausted. Every time you look at me, a giant bags under his eyes and he couldn't possibly have physically worked harder than he did. I mean, did. He did everything he possibly could. One the US national title went on to compete in international competitions all while he was going to medical school instead of a madness. And the way he described it to me, you know, it was, it was more of a prison. The way he described it, he was just burdened. He was always tired and he, it was just expected of him. He was really upset by it.

Speaker 3:          01:15:03       Yeah. It's not quite as. I wouldn't, I don't know what the right term is. Autocratic or dictatorial. I think it's more a, the Baiting, right? I mean, thinking about, for example, the Talmudic tradition, when you sit down and you debate, you discuss you the bay. So there's this, there's this endless inculcation of the pursuit of knowledge just for the sake of knowledge that is endemic to all Jewish homes. Uh, and to, to the extent that some of my family members did not have that particular orientation, frankly, I didn't get along with them as well because I have some family members who are quite mercantile in their approach. They just care about money and I was always maybe to a fault, somebody who cared more about ideas than I did about money. What could be a fault? How could there be a fault there and, and, and, and not pursuing it.

Speaker 3:          01:15:57       Well in the sense, for example, that I'm not a careerist in other words, I do things out of purity. I don't strategize. I don't. Sounds like an awesome dude. Well, thank you. All right, well, I'll give you an example. I'll give you a very concrete example, right? You were asking earlier, you know, well, why don't you get a job here? Well, listen, by me taking very open positions on topics that are quote politically incorrect, I'm not being a careerist. If I would shut my mouth about all these, these issues, maybe some university that might otherwise be very impressed with my scientific dossier might say, Hey, this is, this guy's good. But if he's a shitster, if he appears on Joe Rogan and makes fun of trigger warnings and talks about Islam, well he's a bit of a loose cannon.

Speaker 2:          01:16:38       This is why I disagree. The amount of input that you can have on a culture based out of teaching a classroom of 100 people or more whatever it is in comparison to what you're doing already on your youtube videos. Thank you. It's. It's phenomenal. The reach that you have right now. I'm going to send this to some of the universities that are supposed to hire me. Well, they don't look. They're all in the past. These people did understand what's going on right now. Right now. There's. There's a podcast that you're doing right now

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       that will be heard and watched by more than a million people for sure. Without a doubt. Not only that, it'll exist in perpetuity as long as we have digital content, it'll exist. So there's people listening to this right now, 50 years from now, 100 years from now, if they're still alive, if there's still a world to live in 100 years now people are going to be living in listening to this. You are literally, you know, music to my ears what you're saying because I just had this conversation recently where I was talking to a university about the importance actually to, to a dean when I was talking about the importance of how do we judge academics. I mean academics are meme creators, right? We create memes through our science, but we're also a meme propagators now. To me, one of the highlights of coming to southern California and that's saying a lot, given how much I love southern California, is to appear on your show because I know that the platform that you have, it'll take me 16,000 years to be able to even come close to achieving that type of.

Speaker 1:          01:18:12       And it's not because of a narcissist thing. I want to be famous because ultimately I'm about spreading ideas and that's exactly what you said. I mean a million people are going to listen to, so if I can get one percent of that million to be interested in evolutionary theory after what we've discussed, how does that compare to having 25 students in my classroom, but most universities, you're exactly right. Haven't caught up with the times. No one has the university itself. Okay. This is not the only way you can learn these ideas, that the only way to get an education is to get a degree. To go to sit in class, to do all the work. The teacher prescribes all this stuff that you have to turn in and all the papers that you have to do. That's not the only way to get an education.

Speaker 1:          01:18:54       That's nonsense. This is a human construct and we're living in a world where that doesn't make much sense anymore. You're gonna have in the future, a primary education is going to be online. It's without a doubt. Why travel somewhere white go somewhere. Especially when you dealing with all these fucking assholes in these campuses that are instituting all these ridiculous rules of social behavior and all these social misfits that want to level the playing field and all this nonsense that's going on. That's really it. It stifles a lot of open discussion. It stifles a lot of, of exchanges of information because of these ideas. These people have that these are these rigid ideas that cannot be breached. I think we're living in a world now where you have instant access to information to go to a physical place to learn. Seems to me to be kind of archaic. It's kind of retro isn't ours. Just recently asked. Maybe I shouldn't be commenting publicly, but I go ahead and do it. Uh, there's a company called great courses. Have you heard of it? Yeah. They were a sponsor of the podcast in the beginning. No kidding. Yeah. Yeah. I have one of them at home on psychology, so I was honored to be asked to. It hasn't yet. We haven't signed a contract. They're still looking into it, but the mere fact that they

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       contacted me as one of the perspective people to put together a course for them, a great courses course on evolutionary psychology and so awesome. Thank you. So, I mean, imagine the number of people that I can potentially reach by putting together that course. Look, there's this guy. You should check him out. Robert Sapolsky or you know, very well known. Yeah, from Stanford. I'm not loving you more and more by the second. I work on toxoplasmosis. I've been studying him for years. Look at this stuff on baboons. Isn't it mind going, oh my God. So I need to spend like months every year in Africa. Youtube clips. Yeah. I'm a big fan of that. So anyway, so I wrote to him, by the way, maybe I shouldn't be advertising a failure, but it's okay. So I wrote to him because I really wanted him on my show and he was very gracious.

Speaker 3:          01:20:57       He responded right away, said, look, I'd love to. So on. I'm just, I'm working on two books. I'm shutting down everything. I'm saying no to everybody. Maybe some point in the future, which of course I completely understand, but you know, look at this guy. I mean you go to his youtube, whatever, 900,000 views, one point, 1 million of a lecture that typically would have been viewed by 80 people. Right? I Bet I sent a couple of hundred thousand people to those things. Just no kidding. Big Fan of that guy been sending people to is his videos and his lectures for years. So let's talk about what are the findings from his drone to do that. Sure. So he's got research, because you mentioned baboons showing that in a, in a, in a sort of a hierarchical society of baboons, the lower ranked baboons will have higher cortisol levels, will have more stress hormones.

Speaker 3:          01:21:49       While you intuitively you might think the opposite. You might think that the higher the rank of the baboon, the more stressed he is because he's. He asked to defend against all the other dangers and maintain his position and so on. So people took this exact study and applied it in an organizational context where they looked at an organizational hierarchy and took cortisol levels of people in a big organization. I think it was a the public health system in Britain, the higher the rank of the employee, the lower his or her cortisol level and the argument. So you might say, well, why would that be? Wouldn't the person who is higher rank be more stressed? I mean a CEO has to have more stress than, you know, the janitor. And one of the arguments at least that they proposed was the idea of freedom. The guy who was at the lowest rung of the hierarchy has to be told when he could go and relieve himself with his bodily functions. Right? I mean, his, the amount of free destiny that he has in his daily life is very limited. Whereas at least the CEO, even though he's working very hard, he's more master of his, uh, of his daily life. So for example, I work all the time. I can work 10, 12, 15, 18 hour days, but yet I still am. I feel like I'm always free because there's

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       nobody who's telling me what to do with when at any time and apparently just that has a profound effect on your cortisol levels and the origins of that whole study were originally due to Polsky's work with baboons. If I believe, if I'm correct, well you know that the finding is mirrored in a special ops guys versus versus enlisted men versus your average soldier. Like one of the big issues that people have today is ptsd and one of the factors in ptsd is people who are waiting for things to happen versus people who are making things happen. Whereas seals, rangers, people that they send in to go and kick ass and take names. Those guys have way less stress, which is kind of crazy. Way less incidences of PTSD and you know, obviously still tremendously stressful and still a lot of instances of ptsd but less.

Speaker 1:          01:24:02       And the more guys that I talked to that have served will tell you that the reason is that they're active and that they're. They're proactive. They're the ones who are moving in and doing these things and they're going after these bad guys and hunting them down essentially. Whereas the other people are sitting around the base worrying they're going to get attacked or you know, saying on their post or driving a car, worrying they're going to hit an IED. Very interesting. So let's, let's propose it. And another hypothesis was maybe somebody who's a graduate student might test a coaches versus players. So based on your logic of the findings that you just said, the coach should probably have much higher cortisol levels because he writes out of his control and that's why you see them on the sidelines going freaking out, going crazy because you really can't affect much influence on the game.

Speaker 1:          01:24:53       I mean you can add the margins that in terms of the strategies and so on. But the guys that are in the battle, I mean, I, you know, I was a competitive soccer player and of course you are not the few minutes before you've got butterflies. Once you're in the thick of things, you're not stressed, you're focused. I mean, you're in the flow, but the coaches, they're the ones who are about to have a heart attack, so I thank you. The intestine, that is probably also a big factor why it's so difficult to beat a champion in, in combat sports because the champion is the one who's in control and the champion is one has been dominating. He has fear and intimidation on his side and therefore he has less stress. Right? He's been, I mean, it's going to have stress no matter what if you're entering into a fight, but the person who's trying to overcome the psychological barrier that is the champion in front of them, like this is big.

Speaker 1:          01:25:38       There's a persona that's attached to like a good example is like Mike Tyson, when he was in his prime, nobody wanted to believe that he can be beaten and men would lose before they ever got into the ring that he. Buster Douglas case. Yeah. You did. Yeah. So have you ever seen the study, and I don't know if we've mentioned it here before, uh, I think it was published in the journal called a motion where they looked at, I think it was mma fighters, whether they smiled or not before the contest. Have you seen this before? No. Okay. You just send me a private message and I'll look for it. I can't remember the exact details, but there was some nonverbal cues that were studied prior to a fight that if, if, if I remember the study correctly, were highly predictive of the eventual outcome. Wow. That's fast.

Speaker 1:          01:26:23       And is that cool? Well, I bet they're highly predictive of the amount of focus at the fighters entering to the octagon with here he goes, smiles are for losers. I love how you come up. Studies show that MMA fighters who smile before fights don't do well. Well, this is at a way in which I doubt you could really tell and that was published that what they're saying, the pre-fight stare down. Okay. So the preflight steered on that. Well, that makes sense because if you're smiling, it, it most likely means that you're not really in the game. Right. As expected, smile intensity predicted both the outcomes of fights as well as the more detailed measures of inflight hostility. Interestingly, the smiles predicted both reduced hostility from the smiler as well as increased hostility from his opponent. In other words, it seemed that both fighters were attuned to the information being communicated in the preflight smile.

Speaker 1:          01:27:12       These results held even when controlling for existing differences in skill. I e the betting odds of the fight and strength, height and weight though don't go. Don't go drastically altering your gambling strategy just yet. The betting lines still did a better job overall in predicting fights compared to just smile intensity. Yeah. Huh. Have you. Have we talked here about a ratio? Yes. No, but I, I've, I know what you're talking about. They're like the size of fingers at one of the, uh, the, the length of a digital always. I've actually, I think I've thought about at some point either asking you or my nephew to get access to mma fighters to take some measures that capture how androgen highs they are, how much exposure to testosterone at whether it be, for example, through certain facial features or through A. Well, they're two d, four d ratio, which is a measure of how much testosterone you've been exposed to in utero. And so I actually have a study right now with one of my graduate students without a Rumiyah, uh, where we're looking at the links between testosterone and extreme sports using the exact same idea. And so, um, of course an obvious hypothesis might be that on average and then they fighters compared to a control, normal population, non non fighters, uh, will be more androgens. You would think that that has to be true, right?

Speaker 1:          01:28:41       I don't know. Okay. Because I would wonder what are the, I would say maybe probably successful ones I see we've moderated by whether they are, what their trajectory in their career was. I think there are a lot of people who enter into mixed martial arts or martial arts in general because they recognize there's a lot of benefit in trying

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       to overcome extreme challenges and that they're attracted to these things because they get addicted to the rush, the adrenaline rush of a challenge and it's very few challenges that are intense as one on one competition with another person. Um, and I think there's a lot of people who gravitate towards those, not necessarily even, it seems counterintuitive, but you would think that they would be the most violent people or the most angry people and they're doing that because they want to dominate. Well, mixed martial arts is different in a lot of ways, first of all, because in boxing, a lot of times you're seeing people that are searching for a way out there searching for a way out of poverty. They're searching for a way out of bad neighborhoods and crime and they do so through fighting. It's a classic, it's a classic trope, but I think there's something going on with MMA fighters.

Speaker 2:          01:29:51       It's very different in that martial arts seem to be something that costs money and so to join these classes and get proficient, you have to be able to afford them. And so you're getting people that enter into martial arts from two different venues, right? You get wrestlers who classically get it from school that you get it from high school. Rico, Roman wrestlers, you mean freestyle or Greco Roman, you know, depending on. It doesn't matter. There's, there's successful examples of both. And wrestling is probably one of the most important skills to have, if not the most important in mma because the fighter can dictate where the fight takes place. If a really strong wrestler takes you down, he can control you were as if you're a really good kick boxer. Your kickboxing can't really be effective. Someone can take you down at will. So there's, there's that, there's the wrestling which they get in college and they get in high school in which is, you know, at least fairly free college if they have a scholarship and get it for free.

Speaker 2:          01:30:49       Um, but martial arts, like Jujitsu and kickboxing and things along those lines, taekwondo, karate, traditional martial arts, it costs money to take those things. Right? So you're seeing a lot of very educated people that are getting into mma. There's a lot of MMA fighters that are extremely articulate. Isn't there a guy who was a biology teacher, math teacher, rich Franklin math teacher who was a former champion. Yeah, he was UFC champion, very smart guy, very smart guy. And there's a lot of other very, very intelligent guys speak multiple languages, you know, really brilliant people. Um, so you get a different style of fighter, you know, I think there's people out there that are fighting because they were abused as a child. They were bullied and then they have this anger inside of them and they want to express it. So you get a lot of that, but you also get people that just, you know, they're just tough. It's just tough and they want to overcome challenges and they, they get some sort of benefit out of these extreme challenges. So I would, I would wonder, I would wonder what the results of that would be. What about this, this, I think this is probably an obvious hypothesis, but do you think that if we, if one were to a

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       salivary assays to measure testosterone levels, pre-fight post fight and post fight, you're looking at the winner and the loser, clearly the testosterone scores would assort along whether I won or lost exam will also dependent upon how much brain damage they acquire during the fight. That has a pretty significant effect on your pituitary gland. Primarily I had, by the way, uh, since you're a standup professional stand up comedian, one of my former students of postdoc who had, I think I'm going to mention, he, he, he studied the evolutionary roots of humor. And so one of the things that we wanted to study when he was doing his post doc with me, but then he ended up leaving after a year to take a position anyways, uh, was to use the Montreal just for laughs festivals to study that. The Stasi responses of Comedians, uh, you know, prior to getting on stage. And then after finishing and to see whether their testosterone response would be moderated by whether objectively speaking it was a successful set or not. Right. I mean sometimes you get up and you just killed the house. Other Times it's. It's dead silence. So will my endocrinological system response track that reality. And so that's something that I still hopefully we'll test with some future students. What do you think? You think that's a viable?

Speaker 2:          01:33:24       Definitely. I think with bombing especially, it comes down. Yeah, definitely. It's a horrible feeling. I can't imagine there would be any benefit to bombing. Right? Other than maybe your testosterone would spike because you need the energy to run away from them.

Speaker 3:          01:33:42       Do you? Let's say when you, when you're like you are doing a show and you feel as though it's not going well. Are you ever able to redirect the ship or do you. Or is there a point where there's no return? I'm going to suck today. It's just not working. I'm not connecting.

Speaker 2:          01:34:00       There's both. There's, there's definitely times where you're not getting out of the hole. You know, you can dig yourself into a hole that you can't get out of it. What determines that? Is it that your delivery that day is not working or is it there's something endemic to the crowd that for whatever reason, they're just not digging your style. It's all the above. There's a. It could be your delivery, it could be your subject matter. It could be an event, something that went on with the audience. It could be the way you are reacting to them that you chose a path that was ineffective. It could be making fun of them, but that got them to get more on you. It could certainly be that. It could cause a lot of variables involved in whether or not you go down with the ship, but also it could be that you didn't address it.

Speaker 2:          01:34:45       You know, sometimes things are going bad and a guy will address that. It's going bad and they pulled themselves out of it and then it becomes great again. I've seen that. I've done that. I've had like bad moments. We address that bad moment and things snap back or you, you know, you just, you reassess your approach. It does a lot of variables involved in standup comedy, but ultimately what's going on. I've tried to explain this and I've gone over this with many, many comedian friends of mine and we all seem to agree on this. So there's a moment when things are going really well with the audience is laughing and you're in the zone and you're delivering your jokes that you prepared for a long time. Everything's done right. And it's a lot of great timing and everything. It's a, it's a mass hypnosis. It's like when I watch a really funny comedian firewatch a bill burr for say, um, when, when he's on stage and he's killing and I'm watching and I'm laughing my ass off, what I am doing is allowing him to think for me.

Speaker 2:          01:35:40       Right? So I'm allowing him to, you know, if he's talking about having a female president or something like that, he's going through his thought process of what it would be like Bubba, Bubba, Bubba, and as he's going through it, I am. I'm not really doing any calculations, I'm allowing him to do all those calculations. I'm allowing him to take up all of my thought process with his sentences and the the, the, the images that he's depicting and that's what makes it really funny and the whole audience, we're all in it together, so there's this community effect of this group hypnosis, so we're all laughing because we're all on the same page and we're all like these thoughts that he's saying are so funny and we're all going along with it, but when someone's bad or when the joke doesn't work, then everybody's like, Oh, Christ, oh no, this isn't working.

Speaker 2:          01:36:28       Oh No. And you'll look around and see everybody else's uncomfortable and then you see he's uncomfortable and I'm like, oh Jesus, he's, he's, he's bombing right now. And when someone's bombing, then you're forced to completely out of the spell and now you have to do all these calculations. You have to think, you have to do all this, all this consideration, considerations going on. There's a lot happening that wouldn't be happening if a guy was just killing, but someone's killing. It's effortless to watch. Just laughing it off and then you leave. You feel great. So it's when it goes bad, it's uncomfortable for everybody. It's uncomfortable for the audience. It's uncomfortable for the comedian. It's just because you're forced to consider his process, his failures or her failures and her bad jokes or all those things. Do you think there are certain elements of humor? I mean clearly they are culture specific manifestations of you are maybe physical comedy is more appreciated and culture, Asian culture be, but are there specific umer mechanisms that are not mechanism but you know, whatever bueller content that would be universally successful?

Speaker 2:          01:37:34       No. Oh, so you think it's always culture dependent, culture dependent, culture dependent, taste dependent. There's certain styles of humor that some people really enjoy and other people hate. You know, some people like all tumor, which is like keep the mic in the stand, don't move dead. Pan Delivery, put very little effort forth. Some people like that. That's what they prefer. The balding guy with the curly hair, balding guy with the curly found like 20 years ago. He speaks with a very low steven, right? Yeah. Well he's an absurdist. What does that all absurd? Yeah, he's like a used to work at a fire hydrant factory. Couldn't park anywhere near the place. You know, it's like, that's, that's the thing, right, you know, is that kind of comedy. It's like, it's all like really bizarre and I observed one liners. Um, so that's not all that's just really funny and original and all it is a lot of times really bad, you know, unfortunately.

Speaker 2:          01:38:35       And it really, super supportive crowds that gather together, it's almost like they got kicked out of the cool playground so they made their own playground and there's a comedy festival that's going on right now are supposed to be going on some somewhere in New York where somebody sent me this thing and I looked at it for a couple of seconds. I have throw it away. I just like, I can't, I can't even get into this where they're charging different amounts for different access to people who are white males. They, they want to have as few white males as possible, so they want to make it as diverse as possible. So they're opening it up to people of color, Lbgtq x, Y, Z, and, and this is like, this is their solution. Their solution is to not just have the funniest people that they think are there regardless of race, color, creed, ethnicity.

Speaker 2:          01:39:29       Nope. Nope. Exclude the white man and token white bearded men is one of the things that they discussed. And by the way, the people that run the group were all women. So hilarious. I mean, if you want to run a festival, you should be able to do whatever the fuck you want, but the idea that you want to run an art festival, but you want to exclude certain people like pick the best ones. How about pick the best ones, the best ones. Turn out to be white men with beards. Go with that information and try to figure out why that's the case. So from that perspective, are we to assume that I now know what your position is on affirmative action? Well, my position on affirmative action is, um, I think it has good intentions. I think the idea is to try to stop racism.

Speaker 2:          01:40:13       However, if you're getting someone in there, they become a firefighter, but they're less physically fit and less intelligent than someone who could have gotten the job, but unfortunately the, the other guy was from Croatian descent, you know, and you know, he looks like a white man who is privileged, you know, but meanwhile this guy came from a family of very poor immigrants who struggled and scratched and scraped and, you know, people could look at him as the oppressor, which is fucking preposterous. You know, there's a lot of that going on. Yeah. And, um, I think that's ridiculous. So I think that. I agree with that. Yeah. I think this idea of people who are all have a certain amount of melanin in their skin that they should get a job versus people who don't have melanin in their skin. That's stupid, right? I think we should address the core problem, which is why, why is it harder for people who grow up in African American communities or Mexican American communities?

Speaker 2:          01:41:08       Why is it harder for them to get a better education? Why is it harder for them to succeed? Why is it hard for them to resist crime? Why are they in involved in these impoverished areas? And how do we fix that? So, you know what Larry, and we bounced that, you know who larry elder's to sage, have you ever had them on the show? But I will. He's, he and I had been going back and forth through twitter. Uh, of course, you know what his answer would be. So he's an African American. He's also, let's say, what is the reason for all of the things that you said, why this, why that father absence he at now, I don't know whether he is a overusing that, uh, that causal factor, but he certainly seems to be quoting a lot of data that suggests that many of these sort of delirious downstream effects are due to nothing more than father absence.

Speaker 2:          01:41:56       Solve that problem and many of these issues would go away. Well, I think that's a little simplistic because your dad's a fucking piece of shit and lives in your house, you've got a real problem, right? You know, I don't think that's necessarily the only way to do it. Um, and I think you can't just blame, I think one of the things that we were talking about earlier that I think is really important is that cultures become patterns and patterns repeat and these patterns that these people are born into, it's not their choice. And we recognize it as someone who wasn't born in that pattern. You look at a bad pattern of someone being born say, like in Baltimore and extremely impoverished community is filled with crime and gang violence and you go, God, how do we, how does this get corrected? How do we. I had Michael Wood on who's an interesting guy who was a former cop in Baltimore and really, really interesting dude and I think he's trying to run for like he's trying to be a police commissioner.

Speaker 2:          01:42:49       CHICAGO, right? I applied for it and you know, I think he would be a great person for that job. Um, he's got a lot of information and a lot of really, he's very smart, right? Law Common Sense when it comes to this. But one of the things that Michael Wood was talking about when he was on the podcast was that they had found a, I guess a directive from the 19 seventies when they were going through the archives and all the shit that they have in Baltimore. The police director from the 19 seventies was exactly the same as what he was dealing with in the two thousands as far as the neighborhoods that had drugs and neighborhoods where crime. He's like, it's the same pattern, repeating the same patterns over and over and over again, and no one has done anything to try to socially engineer some beneficial change in these communities. Instead they just continue to lock up the same people. And I agree with him that that is essentially at that point it becomes institutionalized racism. Right? And that's a real issue. And I think that that's the issue that needs to be addressed. And I don't think

Speaker 3:          01:43:52       that affirmative action is the best way to do it because I think that also it, it starts to produce this feeling of resentment from people that are more qualified, that don't get the jobs well. And I would think, let's say for the, for the black applicant who, let's say goes to law school, uh, they, they will never know whether they went through the whole process simply on their merit or whether they were helped in some way. And I think that itself won't know. They'll be if they graduate. No, no, no, no. What I mean is when you got it, did you, did you get in strictly on the merits of your Dosha? Let's suppose I actually don't want a, I'm a, I'm a person of color and I don't want anything to be effecting the decision other than purely the merits of my dose here.

Speaker 3:          01:44:45       So now I go through the process at the end of that process, I won't absolutely know for sure whether it was strictly based on what I wanted, which is the murder of my, those here, whether there was some, uh, something that helped me along the way because of this institutionalized affirmative action. So there's not a bit problematic. I guess it could be, but I would assume that by the time you've gone through university, you know, you're, you're now you're talking about a much higher level of education and it should be pretty. I hate to use the term black and white, but it should be right there. I mean, you should see their grades and you see, so are our professors are hired as a function of these things. What I once applied for real say this here publicly, I once applied, so this is, I was coming out on the market finishing my phd, uh, on the market like a cow or since the academic market.

Speaker 3:          01:45:37       And the academic market works is you, you, you interview round one and then route in one place. All the schools come there. And then in round two they invite you for a campus visit. And so I had been, I was interviewing at one of the most prestigious places that you could ever hope to imagine. It's actually from your neck of the woods in Boston, Harvard, right? Uh, maybe I shouldn't have said that and I don't think you said that. I did. They have right salt kittings I'm not admitting whether that's true or not, but apparently I was one of the finalists and at least I had heard from some people who are maybe on the inside, uh, that they were really looking for a woman and that to the extent that I might not be able to articulate a might be a problem. So I don't know if that ended up being the main reason why I think that the job, but I've often heard that, uh, you know, you are not have the right race.

Speaker 3:          01:46:28       We need more diversity, we need more gender diversity, we need more racial diversity and make it fair. And even though, I mean, how has that ever achieved? Well, frankly, it's good. I think it's grotesque. Look, there was a, I don't know if you saw, I had a sad truth clip where I, I titled it the All Time Greatest social justice warriors. It was based on a group of Dartmouth students that had occupied, I think the president's office with a set of. Have you seen, have you seen this? It's about the freedom project. Maybe you can put it up. So the Dartmouth freedom project where they, they had sort of like a manifesto, here are the things that we absolutely expect dartmouth to implement. If you saw that list and I go through some of that on my youtube channel, it's simply baffling. You know, we have to have a, a professor of Color Speaker series. I mean think about that, right? I mean, so if, if, if I'm, if I'm a number theorist, I'm a mathematician, does the amount of melanin that I have determined how I study the distribution of prime numbers. The idea that you would have students demanding that there be a person of color speaker series. I mean it's grotesque, right? I mean we, nobody's denying the fact that racism has existed and to some extent continues to exist, but to have these types of demands to me seems problematic.

Speaker 2:          01:47:52       Well, I, I definitely don't think it's the most intellectual approach to the issue at hand, which is combating racism, right? I don't think it's making. Instead of having an even playing field for all and considering all with equal merit to change the level of the playing field and boost people up that aren't qualified. Right. I think that's where you're talking also about the end result. You're talking about the finished product of an education, you know, I mean literally at the highest level of professor, so I think that if you're looking at that, it really, it all comes down to what is it that's making certain people have less opportunity and that needs to be engineered from a societal level and from a cultural level, and it's. I've said this many, many times at the, the biggest issue with any culture is the weakest link, right?

Speaker 2:          01:48:45       But what's the best way to have a more successful country? What's the best way to have a more successful union will less losers? Well, how do you have less losers here? We give more people education, more people chances, and more people who are disenfranchised and we're stuck in these bad situations. Give them an opportunity to get out some way or another. Whether it's through continued education, whether it's through community centers, whether it's through combat, I mean what will Larry elders talking about better not having fathers? Boy, well we can't just say fuck them, they should have a dad. The Dad should get involved that, that you're not going to fix people like that. The children are the ones that there are still malleable and still have potential. So we have to figure out a way to provide them with some sort of resources. I'm sort of some sort of some sort of mentorship, you know, some, some hope. You know what I mean?

Speaker 3:          01:49:36       Let me, let me just read through this carefully because it's a thorny topic. Earlier we spoke about the, the culture of achievement that

Speaker 2:          01:49:47       we find that is that make within Jewish homes. Yes. By the same token, do you think that other cultures might be creating environments that are exactly the opposite of that? In other words, yes, there might be some endemic institutional reasons why people don't succeed, but there are also individual responsibility or collective responsibility within the family or the culture. I think just eluding to that. We'll let. We'll will cause people to level an accusation of racism against you, right? I mean, think about Bill Cosby, Bill Cosby, I know he's not popular now, but at one point he was walking around and saying exactly that, right? That, that, that blacks have to take responsibility for some of their failures and he was that that message was not very well received. Well, he, you know, he's saying it from an easy place saying it from someone who's very successful, right?

Speaker 2:          01:50:41       I think. I think people imitate their atmosphere. I think culture's exists because it's easy to pattern yourself around what's around you and that's. That exists in a religious sense and it exists in a behavioral sense. You, you become a lot like the people that you surround yourself with. That's why it's so important to surround yourself with positive people. It's one of the most important lessons you could ever learn as a human being. The more positive people you surround yourself with, the more you'll aspire to be like them. The more you you have a high standard that exists all around you. Well, if you're fucked and you grow up in a place without, with no hope and a lot of despair. I mean, I remember when I first moved to New York when I was in my early twenties and uh, I didn't really have that many friends at first and it was, and I had a few friends that I just, I was really disappointed with them and one of them because he just would say so much racist shit, it would drive me crazy and I just, I wasn't, I was almost like God damn it.

Speaker 2:          01:51:43       Like I can't find friends like I had in Boston, you know, I was, I was, I had a bunch of knuckleheads that I wish that I knew and I needed to establish, you know, it takes a while when, especially when you're young and by the way, no Internet back then. So you're trying to find good friends and friends that were like in my profession as standup comics. So I had to like, you know, get closer to a few people that are in these communities. And it took a long time. But I remember feeling really depressed when I first moved there and it was, it was a cause for me to reconsider moving back to Boston. There was one point in time, even though I had just signed with this new manager that's still my manager to this day and there's all this hope and promise that like, wow, I'm actually going to have a career now.

Speaker 2:          01:52:28       I was so bummed out by the people that I was around with that I would go back to Boston and do gigs and I'd be like, fuck, I want to move back here man. Because I was like Boston for all of its faults and you know, is a very smart place. And as, as New York. But I had just, I had infiltrated into a really great community in Boston and I hadn't done that yet in New York. So there's a very small, you know, obviously a couple of years later I was fine. But it was when you're not around positive people, it doesn't feel good. I was living in North New Jersey when I first moved there because that's where my grandfather lived and I didn't have any money, so I stayed with him for awhile and he was in a terrible neighborhood and he had bought a house there a long time ago and the community had changed several times and gotten worse and worse and the kid next door before I had moved in, I think somewhere around the time that I was living there, his door got broken down by the cops and they was selling crack and it was, it was, it was real bad.

Speaker 2:          01:53:24       Right. You know, so I've felt depressed living there and the environment that I've found myself in my, my grandmother had had a stroke so she would moan. And the grandmother who's a Mafia. I runner, yeah. Yeah. That was earlier in her life when she was mobile, but she had a, she had a stroke and she, she gave her 70, like 72 hours to live. She lived for 12 years and they were like, she's probably going to die. Like she. She had a really bad stroke, but somehow she hung on by a thread for a long time and you know, my grandfather used to have to change your sheets and she had bed sores because she would just lay in one place. She couldn't really move. It was awful. It was awful. So that environment of being in this really poor neighborhood, being poor myself, I had no fucking money being around bad, like didn't have good friends.

Speaker 2:          01:54:12       It's depressing. It's depressing now. Obviously I had opportunity, I had a career. There's a way to get out of that, but I got a taste. I think even though the tiniest, tiniest, tiniest taste of despair, what it's like to be stuck in a shit situation now, imagine being born in that situation because I, you know, I moved there when I was in my twenties. I was like 23 or something like that. Imagine if I was there my whole life and I just been around fucked up. People had been sexually abused or physically abused or you know, my mother was selling crack or you know, my brother was in jail or who knows, he. There's a lot of variables that can lead to a terrible state of mind and it's insanely hard to overcome the patterns of the past and the patterns of your environment and until we address that, this idea of pulling yourself up by your bootstraps, it's fucking ridiculous.

Speaker 2:          01:55:02       The idea of, well, the cops wouldn't be shooting these young black kids if they just didn't commit crimes. That's crazy. That's crazy because it's not even. It's not an even playing field. It's not even for me, comparing myself of 23 to myself, a 48, it's not that I have way more opportunity now. It's way easier. Life. It's way easier and way, way, way better friends way. I've established a nice community with my friends. Do you still a form of a lot of new friendships or do you have. Yeah, yeah. I have new friendships. Yeah, I definitely sent you. Well, thank you. I'm honored to be amongst that group because of doing this podcast. It's allowed me to communicate with some really fascinating people and that that's definitely allowed me to formulate some new and it's allowed me to evolve my perspective to examine my own ideas and to, you know, I think all of us that, that I'm friends with, we've all experienced that sort of same similar growth pattern because, you know, as you take in more information, you communicate with each other about things, you kind of evolve ideas. And

Speaker 3:          01:56:03       so there was a study done I think a longitudinal study and I believe I mentioned it in the book, uh, at Harvard, I think the, the, the lead investigator, I think his name is George French would say I guess viola or Vegan, I think that's his name. And out of 75 years of research in terms of what is sort of the number one predictor that makes people happy or content. I can't remember the exact dependent measure. The number one thing was establishing meaningful connections with others. I mean 75 years of research out of a million possible causal factors were distilled to that. One fact.

Speaker 2:          01:56:40       I would agree with that. Exactly. I would agree with that. The mother's status. People I know are lonely. Exactly. Your saddest people I know, you know, I know. Um, I know a few comedians don't have comedian friends too, which is really weird. They're sort of ostracized by the community in some weird way and those people are really sad, really sad or really lonely and really

Speaker 3:          01:57:00       weird. Well, I mean, I don't know if we've ever mentioned this and this on this podcast, but uh, if you take prisoners, many of them will prefer to be in general population where they might be jumped and stabbed then raped than to be put in solitary. Precisely because solitary confinement is the ultimate of punishments to a social species, right?

Speaker 2:          01:57:21       Yeah. We need each other and these, these biological requirements that we don't consider because we meet them on a daily basis, you know, that's one of them is getting outside and you know, I, I, I feel it

Speaker 3:          01:57:34       often because of course in my career there are two parts of me, there is the cocoon and my study. I'm working on a book and for the next 16 months I'm pretty much focused on that and I become sort of a cave dweller and of course there's the public side of me which is very extroverted and social and so on. Once in a while when I've spent several days very much cocooned and then I go out even to me to graduate students to discuss ideas or a friend, I literally come back

Speaker 2:          01:58:05       refreshed in a way that is akin to satiating a thirst or hunger or sexual need. Right. I mean, you genuinely feel that I went out with Joe and we had coffee and I really needed that. Right, that exactly that. Yeah. Yeah. I think I feel like that all the time when I see my friends, you know, I work with um, my good friend Joey Diaz last night at the comedy store and when I saw him, you know, I hadn't seen him a couple of days or so. I may see them all the time, but I hadn't seen him and he gave me a big hug and I'm hugging them. I'm like, ah, so good to see this guy, by the way, you know, what is hormonal marker

Speaker 3:          01:58:41       of hugging, Lux release of oxytocin.

Speaker 2:          01:58:44       Makes Sense. Makes Sense. I mean, a friend that I genuinely love and he genuinely loves me. We see each other big smiles, big hug. It's warm and it's awesome, you know, and when you don't have that in life, you suffer. When I first moved to La I had gone here to uh, to do some acting and I was here for a couple of weeks and I didn't have any friends again, same sort of situation and I had gone, you know, like, like maybe like two weeks being here and really not really knowing anybody. And this girl that I was working with on the set gave me a hug and I remember that hug felt so good and it didn't feel good. Like I wanted to fuck her. Right. It felt good, like, like warm, like love, like an actual person being kind to me, you know? Or else like I was so weirded out by being in this strange place and living in La and like I'd just gotten accustomed to, I just established like a community in New York, you know, established some friends and I was just starting to be happy in New York and all something out in La.

Speaker 3:          01:59:48       Well, so in Darwinian Psychiatry, which is a field of psychiatry that applies evolutionary principles, there's this idea of. So for example, we've evolved in bands of about up to 150 people, right? Do you might've heard of raw robin Dunbar's number? Yes. Yeah. So the idea is a hundred and 50 people you can keep in your social memory exactly right, because computationally you want to be able to mark who's trustworthy, who's not. This guy reciprocated. This guy doesn't once you get past one, because it's very difficult to maintain all these in your head. Well, so in the context of the environments in which we've evolved, small groups, repeat interactions, our need for social interaction is certainly met. On the other hand, you could live in New York, you're surrounded by 8 million people. You think, how could somebody be lonely when you step outside and you bump into 17,000 people yet the rates of depression in this very lonely place, but yet very filled place as much greater than 150. Precisely because there is a mismatch between the environment in which we've evolved and the contemporary environment and so that's in the field of evolutionary psychiatry. You study these types of things.

Speaker 2:          02:00:59       That's fascinating. The mismatch is true and also there's an intimacy wall that people put up because there's too many folks, right? There's too many people and when there's too many people, you can't make friends with everybody. Whereas if you're in a small town, you wave to people as you're driving by, you don't wave to people. In New York you'd be. You'd go fucking crazy. Imagine if you had to wave to every cab that passed you. In New York, if you're driving, you just.

Speaker 3:          02:01:21       It's not possible so, but in your case, as somebody who obviously is as well known and so on, a lot of people are trying to be friends. You does that result in you having a bit more of a precautionary approach with people because you always think that there might be some. That doesn't have to be angle Aj, I just want

Speaker 2:          02:01:40       to be, you know, friends with this famous person. Does that ever come into play in your interactions? Yeah, you definitely going to have that, but you know, you just find other likeminded people. Just find people that are like you or similar. Similar. Yeah. You get to be picky, you know, and also there's, there's a lot of weight to it, you know, if you like for you, for example, perfect example like you, you start doing this podcast, your podcast has taken off, your youtube series is taken off and then people want to become friends with you because they think that they can get on your show or piggy back on your success and they, they calculate and they look at you and they say, if I could just get in with the Godfather, I will be. I'll be in and then I'll, I'll get a youtube following.

Speaker 2:          02:02:22       Then I'll get a little twitter following that I can get a career. Like there's people that do calculate things like that and I've met people like that in the world of standup where people have said, hey, you know, take me under your wing. Like, what are you fucking crazy. There's no wing. Go, go get your own way. Yeah, I don't have time. I barely have time to do what I'm doing right now and continue my own stuff like you, you see funny like, but there's certain comics will see them and I know they're really good and they're working really hard and then I'll take them on the road with me. Like Tony Hinchcliffe is a perfect example. I think he was opening for you in Montreal when you take them with me everywhere. And then there's other ones like that where I meet them and they're, they're working hard and they're, they're hustling and then I can help them, you know?

Speaker 2:          02:03:08       But some people don't. They don't want to work hard. They just want to sort of cling on to you like a lamprey and then they think somehow know that'll take them to. And you got to know who those people are and some people don't. And I have friends that don't, they don't know, so I'll be hanging around with them like, who the fuck is this guy? And like, oh, he's a good guy. He's a good guy. I'm like, wow, what are you doing man? What are you doing? Like they'll bring these guys on the road with them and they're. They're terrible comedians. But what they do is they know how to stroke their ego and kiss their ass and they've become a part of their system. And the they, a lot of my friends who have had this, they had real problems with these people where there's a deep resentment that gets established when the person's career doesn't take off.

Speaker 2:          02:03:50       Right? You know, it doesn't happen because they really don't have that much talent. They're just really good at kissing ass and they get upset. This person's not helping them. Like, what the fuck have you done? You've let this knuckle head into your life because they figured out a way how to woo you and beginning. So you have to be careful, but you also have to be careful with yourself. You have to be careful with your own behavior. You have to, you have to objectively monitor your own thinking and you have to spend time alone just thinking and that's something that people don't like to do. Right, and that's something I think is absolutely critical. It's one of the most critical things for a grown person to do is to spend some time and just think alone, just thinking and monitor your thoughts, monitor your life, and then go forth from that with some directives, with some ideas, with some guidelines of what you want to do and what you want to accomplish.

Speaker 2:          02:04:45       Because if you don't do that, you sort of live life, untethered, untethered to your dreams or your ideas or mean even dreams as far as like community and family. Like those aren't like lofty aspirations and sent in the sense of like unachievable things like climbing everest in your underwear. We're talking about things that can be done but oftentimes aren't because you don't pursue them. With that director of like my directive to establish a happy family, to be a good friend, to be a good neighbor, to all these things, people don't. You oftentimes don't consider how much of a factor those things play in your overall happiness and the happiness of the people around you. You know, and you can do that, but you always have to think about it

Speaker 3:          02:05:27       earlier for, of course your viewers don't know. We I introduced you to. One of my friends was an FBI special agent and we were chatting. I've been here for a few days, so we had gone out together and I was telling him that oftentimes I get an itch for like a man's man, companionship. You know what I mean? Yes. Because I mean not not to stereotype, but sometimes the intellectual types with whom I can go out who are part of my world, who are my colleagues will will satisfy a particular itch, but of course I used to be a soccer player and I'm, I'm a guy's guy and I eat right. I mean, we need to be able to talk about certain things that are not necessarily within the confines need fellow sexist say it fellow sexist, but, but, but fellow guys who can sort of let, let let the hair down.

Speaker 3:          02:06:16       Right? But you're allowed to be yourself and, and I mean not, not that I'm not myself and the other guy, but they are different sort of rules of conduct and different settings, right? The way you act in way. And uh, and I find that recently maybe because of course I think we both have young children. Were you somewhat cocoon? I've lost a bit of the male bonding and comradery that comes with playing in a soccer team or under many, many professional athletes as you know, when they retire they will always say, you know, they don't miss playing in front of 100,000 people or the adulation, but they miss the Camaraderie. The Brotherhood would there and that, that element of male male bonding is something that sometimes I Miss Because of how busy my life is.

Speaker 2:          02:07:04       Yes. I completely agree. And I've found that the most potent form of that is hunting camps. Okay. That hunting camps, when you go hunting and camping out and you have a. well, you're focused on one thing and all you're surrounded by these men and everyone is allowed to be themselves and you. You were also, you were in engaging in this intensely quote unquote manly activity, right? That is almost the polar opposite of raising children and coddling little girls. It, it becomes this manly pursuit and it's very satisfying. Right? Deep genetic level. Exactly. Because I think there's these reward systems that are established thousands of years ago in our DNA, right? It's like why you like being around a campfire, like why is that? Because it's super beneficial to have a fire wards off predators keeps you warm, it cooks you off the mosquitoes, the mosquitoes. So many benefits to having this fire that when you have one, it's like naturally satisfying. Ooh, well, you know, we all huddled around it and you know, it's odd to leave it, you know, it's. I think that being around other men is a. it's oftentimes thought that these men are going to get together and I think men things come back and be sexist, patriarchal, and gonna come back and ruin all this progress that we've had and there is that idea that somehow or another that manly is anti progressive and anti anti equal anti equal rights and equal values.

Speaker 3:          02:08:32       It's funny by the way, that when you ask a lot of women what types of Ben they want, they will typically point to the male archetype that is most viewed with the stain by the current wave of third wave feminism. Right. Talk to those women when they're being honest and alone. Yeah. If they got called out by. Yeah. I mean, so I, I was wanting to communicating with the. I think she was either Swedish or Danish, what she was saying that especially I think she was Swedish where in Sweden they had this sort of longstanding experiment where they try to remove gender pronouns. Right. Why don't you explain that? Because it's very bizarre people. Well, the idea is that they're trying to, as much as they can remove any gender markers in any setting. And so the idea is that we should be gender neutral in every possible way.

Speaker 3:          02:09:27       Incidentally, there was a study on toy preferences done in Sweden, right? The, the, the Mecca of gender neutrality. And guess what? Little Boys and little girls gravitate to exactly the same sex specific voices everywhere else on earth core, despite 40 years of a social engineering. It hasn't done anything, but anyways. And so, so the men there have been so ravaged by third wave feminism that, I mean literally they're there, they're there, they have no testicles a lot, metaphorically, not literally, uh, and uh, and so we were chatting on it, whatever. And she, and she was saying that she misses the, the pursuit. I eman courting her. I mean, not sexually harassing her but, but there is a sense that happens. Well, it's actually harassing

Speaker 2:          02:10:15       when you're not attracted to that man. Exactly. That's where it gets confusing, right? Because it's the right man, you know, Johnny Depp or something is, is pursuing you. It's, it's hot. If, if some fat slob with dirty breath is pursuing you harassment. Exactly. Yeah. I mean that's

Speaker 3:          02:10:34       oftentimes and so men have become so tentative, it apparently and sweetness that oftentimes these women, the reason why they like guys, you know, sort of the stereotypical Italian guy when they go, it's not only of course Italian guys on average American, very stylish and good looking, but it's because the, that political correctness that has stifled natural dynamics between men and women hasn't fully permeated, say Italian culture so that when women pass by, yes, you don't want them to be cat calling them, but guys will approach. You guys will hit on. You guys will tell you you're beautiful. And in the deep recesses of even the most ardent feminist, you like that, I mean, that's part of the natural dynamics of men and women. Right? But it's so confusing now for anyone because you don't know. I mean, if I tell you, you look good today at work, is that sexual harassment or not? Should I only tell my male colleague that he really looks good in this time, but I shouldn't. Right? Well, the problem is if you are attracted to this man and he tells you you look good and you say why thank you, and he's like, yeah, I'd love to stick my dick in your mouth. Like, okay, you fucked it up. You know, it's

Speaker 2:          02:11:40       how far do people take it if it's a gender or a sexual neutral thing, like, uh, hey, uh, debra, you look wonderful today. I love your dress. Look fantastic. Well thank you Mike. And then you know, he goes to work and you go to work and everybody's happy and you are friends. There's a neutrality of sexual neutrality there, but that's the platonic values that people would like to see in the workplace. Rarely exist. There's always coveted sexual desires that people, their unrequited love and the affairs that take place because people were working together in these environments for eight hours a day staring at each other. It's normal thoughts and ideas. It's an, it's an in. It's an abnormal environment for men and women to be in these, in these workplaces and not have those thoughts. That's abnormal. The thoughts, I mean Matt and managing those thoughts becomes incredibly tricky, which is why you need to establish very strict behavior and know laws and rules and regulations in the workforce because you don't want women to have to deal with bullshit or men, you know, I've had men that were in here.

Speaker 2:          02:12:42       I had a guy, the amazing atheist was talking about this woman that he had that was like, she was his boss and he was getting sexually harassed, like on a daily basis and it was torturous. It was brutal. She would grab his ass who tried to get him to fuck her and he didn't want to. He wasn't attracted to her, but she was an atheist. Was the recipient of that. Yes. He's a youtube guy. I don't have to show the drunken peasants. Yeah. Good Dude. Yeah. Um, and so, you know, he was talking about it from his perspective where people don't look at it like that he was in any sort of a bad situation at all. They laugh it off because he's mad. Know was like, what the fuck? So he's like psychologically devastated. He's got to go to work all the time. This lady's Greg grab his ass and she's gross. She's above him. Right? And so he's experiencing what a lot of women experienced. Only no one

Speaker 3:          02:13:32       cares because he's a man, you know. It's like, Oh, speaking of not sexual harassment, but continuing on that train of thought, uh, I had a public exchange with a woman who started as trying to pass a bill, I think in New Jersey. Uh, maybe in New York. I can't remember. It's called the rape by fraud. Oh yeah, I've seen that. Yeah. Have you seen it through me or I've seen that law that they're trying to pass this whole area. So I explained the law because it's. So. The basic idea is that she's arguing that when you, in the same way that you enter a contract with somebody and if you do so under false pretense than you are engaging in a fraudulent action. Well, when you get somebody to go to bed with you under false pretense, you lie about your background, your education, you learning about whatever, and you get that person to acquiesce to your advances.

Speaker 3:          02:14:25       And you have sex with them. Well then that is a, a, an instantiation of rape by fraud, right? You, you, you were able to have sex with me under false pretenses. And so I saw this thing. I thought it was breathtaking how idiotic it was. I said, well, okay, let me put together a sad truth youtube clip. And in the clip I didn't mention her. I didn't attack the woman who's trying to move the, the, the idea. But of course I linked back to her site because I want to be judicious and link show that it's a real thing. The real thing. Show them as, as, as a scientist. So she, she starts hammering at me. Uh, she puts up this website. I'm sure she could probably find them. Maybe I shouldn't have given this platform for her. Uh, maybe you shouldn't put it because she'll just get more attention.

Speaker 3:          02:15:18       But anyways, up, she's saying that I am a rape by fraud enabler. So. And then she goes on to say that you better stop critiquing my ideas because you're going to have a lawsuit from my lawyer for being live. And the family story to me, so the mindset of person, those words in roughly those words. Yeah, critiquing, so maybe I'm paraphrasing, but mean the fact that I'm coming after her. So this woman thought that her putting up an idea in the marketplace of ideas and having somebody scrutinize that idea and harassment is harassment, was a form of defamation. It being libelous and I thought that was just breathtaking and I had two other cases with two for both happen to be Forbes journalist, female journalists where we went back and forth it very, very quickly. This integrated on on twitter. They started doing this year cyber bullying me when I had done no such thing. I was very, very tepid and so on and I used against both of them. Some. Some people might have already heard this story. I use against both of them. The fact that I

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       score higher on oppression Olympics or victimology poker brown man from the Middle East, jus Arab, overweight. And so then I started moving on from tell your story is a story that you told them. This podcast that's about as presses again. Exactly. And so I turned it against them, guess what? They disappeared. So imagine how grotesque their mindset is. As long as they thought they could say, you know, you're a pig, you're cyber bullying me. Maybe they need eat that. Yeah, twitter things. Uh, they felt safe. The second I started, I actually was satirizing saying, why are you attacking a brown man? Why are you attacking me? Just because I'm overweight? I have this beard faster than you could say godfather because they knew that they would be accused of Anti. And I, you literally use those things like, you know, you're an anti Semite you're in bureau and, and it works.

Speaker 1:          02:17:21       It's magical. It's so stupid. Why don't you just engage me in ideas about identity politics? Well, I think there's some value in some merit in the idea that you shouldn't be able to lie to people and fuck them. Right? I think like if you say you're a prince from another country and you want to take this person to your land and they will live forever in a garden of Eden, and this woman thinks, oh my God, I met the perfect guy. But it's not right by fraud. Okay. Well, what is it? No, I actually in my, in my clip, I made it clear that I find that morally and ethically reprehensible, I believe that people should be maximally honest in their daily affairs. Exactly. So, but I don't call it rape by fraud. You're okay. It's not rape, but what is it? Duplicity. It's caveat emptor, buyer beware, but there's something that we value very intensely about intimacy.

Speaker 1:          02:18:20       And uh, someone who achieves intimacy through false pretenses. It's, it's different than someone that like, uh, you know, says they're going to pay for lunch. Ninety years old, they're going to give you a million dollars and they don't. Okay. But yeah, I do. Ninety five percent of online dating would be then rape. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. It should be. Should it be all rape, right? Men Lie about their education, about their income, their height. Women lie about their age, about their weight. They wear pushup bras at part of the mating ritual as, as the testable as it might be, is that people engage in deceptive signaling. Animals evolve deceptive signals. Right? So, so that's called everybody a rape. I mean everybody is a rapist. Well, under that you're getting real extreme because we're, we're talking about like what kind of lies are we talking about where it would be raped by fraud?

Speaker 1:          02:19:15       Like is it established? Do they have certain parameters that would. So I don't know that achieved that. This terminal. The boundaries. I think in her case, I know that she has experienced a very bad deception where the guy whom she, I don't know if she married him or not, you know, had said that he was ABC, but it turned out to not be true. And he had maybe, okay, it's dreadful. It's horrible. But that's, that's called life. I mean, you learn from that. I mean that happened to Cindy [inaudible], Cindy Crawford, Christie Brinkley, she married some guy, she was in a helicopter crash with, turned out to be kind of a con man. And as time went on she realized it and you know, across to a lot of money. Okay. A woman who fakes an orgasm with you is raping you because the next time, the next time that you have sex with her under the false pretense that you received positive feedback that you're a great lover because you gave her an orgasm, but she was faking her orgasm.

Speaker 1:          02:20:12       She's raping me, so that's ridiculous. So far off the beaten path because the woman is saying like, you gave her pleasure, like it's. There's no loss to you like that. It doesn't hurt you in any way. Like if that woman said like, you made me come so because he made me come, I'm going to give you a million dollars and then you can quit your job, so you quit your job. You're like, I'm the best pussy eater ever. I'm going to get paid for this, and you quit your job because of that, and then it turns out that she doesn't really have a million dollars and you'd even make her have an orgasm. Well then you fucked up. No, the only reason I wanted to have sex with her again is because of the feedback I received for the great love of your own pleasures of secondary nature come out on the secondary.

Speaker 1:          02:20:57       I'm a very giving guy. I'm completely all justice. Such as stress. You should abandon it immediately is a terrible argument. But I think there is, there's a certain amount of validity to what this woman saying like as far as like someone who was like very deceptive, who uses that deception to have sex with you and you find out they're a liar. That feels terrible. Yes. So like, but what should it be like, what if, you know what I mean? What, what, what would, what could it be mean if a guy says he's a one eighth Indian, you know, my, uh, my mom's a patchy on my grandfather's side, no end, but it's all bullshit when you're attracted to that and some sort of strange way because you really like a dream catchers, you know, I've always wanted to be with a native American and then you find out the guys really like German, Irish and you know, he's a liar.

Speaker 1:          02:21:42       Like is that, is that right? Of course not right. Okay. So what is that? That's just a liar. What? But when life, when is it a problem? It's a, it's a problem. When someone does it in somehow or another, it harms the person who's been deceived. It becomes a crime, right? I think if there is, I mean I don't know, I'd have to think about what the parameters are, but I mean if, if you, if you were engaging in a repeat interaction where you defrauded the person through a misrepresentation, but I mean the idea that to get somebody to date you or have sex with you and through the pursuit of that objective, July as reprehensible, that may be clear. Again, it's reprehensible and I certainly don't live my life that way. Although I'm married

Speaker 2:          02:22:26       now, but I never have lived my life that way. You can't criminalize a central feature of human nature. It is incumbent of on each individual to do their homework. I mean you do your due diligence and find out if the guy that you're speaking to is a Nigerian prince. Right, but doesn't this woman have a kind of fairly fairly cut and dry parameters that she's establishing? I don't. I. You don't know why. I don't know either. If she did, maybe that would give it more validity of something that she's been thinking about for a long time, but I can never imagine that it would ever be able to meet the standards of it being called rape. You know, what's interesting about this conversation is that what we're talking about as a person who's been fucked over and that person has gone out of their way to make sure this never happens again because they've been hurt, they've been tortured.

Speaker 2:          02:23:13       I think you see a lot of that with like really radical feminism in general. What you see is a lot of women who their interactions with men have not been positive and unfortunately the stereotype is that these are very unattractive women. Well, if you're a very unattractive woman and you go through life just being rejected by man or being treated like shit by men, there's like a natural tendency to think that men are terrible because they've rejected. Like maybe you're attracted to a man and he. He laughed at you and mocks you. That. I've seen that on the male side too, and with a close friend. I had a friend that I watched him evolve into a woman hater. He had aspirations and hopes, find a good girl and he had this one girl he was dating and she fucked him over and then another girl fucked them over and just women I'm working at attracted to him and you know, it just got darker and darker as he got older and older to the point where he genuinely would say like, just generalized terrible things about women like women.

Speaker 2:          02:24:16       They're all fucking Horace Mann. They all just want your money. They're all fucking pigs. Fuck them. Who gives a shit? I hope they get raped. Like you would say, crazy shit like that. And you'd be like, whoa. Like where did this come from? Well, it came from a lifetime of rejection and associating women with a negative feeling. Right? I'm attracted to them. I come up to them, they shit on me. I'm attracted to them. I come up to them to shit on me over and over and over again to the point where he broke, you know, he just, it was easier for him to form these generalizations and the act on these or to have these in his mindset and I think that this is the unfortunate reality about sexual attraction in, as it pertains to the dynamics of men and women interacting with each other.

Speaker 2:          02:24:54       There's a lot going on there when you look at unattractive of feminist versus over, over and over again, you see one after the other, after the other. How do we, there's a study that was done, uh, I think published in frontiers in human neuroscience where they measured that the ratio and administered a scale of gender, you know, how much you score and masculinity femininity, if I remember correctly, or dominance or something at a feminist conference. And the women were more masculinized at that conference. So there is empirical evidence for sort of your anecdotal intuition. It makes sense. And also women that are forced to work, you know, they, they've found that women in the workplace generally develop more testosterone, right? Yes, yes. Women that are forced to fend for themselves generally develop more testosterone. It it, it literally alters the way their hormones, so it's not that depending on the fields that they go into, they start off with more or less to start strong.

Speaker 2:          02:25:53       So you're saying that it's their response. They're saying that they believe it is a response to women being independent and being forced to provide for themselves that they develop more testosterone. I don't know how the fuck they prove that. I don't know how he likes to see. The problem is you would have to have the exact same person with the exact same genetics take two completely different paths, so you'd have to do with identical twins with very similar input, right? Because like your jeans, a lot of what's going on, the way they express themselves is dependent upon your environment, your experiences. There's a lot going on that simple. I, I, I think my last set truth clip was on exactly that where I was arguing that the whole idea of biological determinism as applied to evolutionary psychology is complete nonsense. And one of the examples that I give is exactly the words that you use, which is that genes are turned on or off as a function of environmental inputs.

Speaker 2:          02:26:44       Right? So, so the idea when people levy, he's like, Oh, you're an evolutionary psychologist. Also, you believe everything is biologically determined. Somebody who says that is effectively saying, I understand nothing about biology, right? Yeah. It's um, it's very complex and only being recently understood within the last couple of decades. So we're talking about a fairly new science that is, or a fairly new data I should say, that a lot of people just haven't accepted yet. And it's very convenient to generalize instead to not taking into account all these incredibly complex variables that determine whether a human being is this way or that way, whether they're more masculine and more. It's like, what have you had to do? What? How have you had to fend for yourself? Have you had to get through life? What, what, what, what have you had to do as far as like who have you had to nurture and take care of?

Speaker 2:          02:27:39       You know what? There's a lot of variables that lead to a person being a person and there's a lot of different styles of people and some men like really strong dominant mother figure wives. They love it. That's what they want. They want some woman to take care of everything and tell them what to do. I have friends like that. They want that woman to yell at them and tell them what to do it. It alleviates a lot of questions and choices and that's what they look forward to and then I have other friends that want the wife to be like some 19 fifties housewife from a, from a movie where she was just leave it to beaver. You come home, dinner's on the table, she gives you a kiss and you know, it's like real traditional values, but there's feminists that we'll look at that woman and she's an enemy

Speaker 1:          02:28:22       like that. Her life, although it makes her happy to exist in this way, they have a really. A cooperative relationship, doesn't have the right to that choice and Amanda's never have the right to be masculine. Men Don't have a right to go on these hunting camps. First of all, you should only eat vegetables, you should be a Vegan, you know, and then in doing so you definitely shouldn't be a hunter and you definitely shouldn't be involved in masculine sports or activities. You definitely shouldn't enjoy weightlifting or anything that's going to make you more men because it'll make you toxic. You're a toxic masculinity. That's hilarious. Do we want to talk about quickly or. I'm not that familiar with her other than I've seen a couple of her videos about video games and I'm like, and they've also seen thunder foot stuff on her, which is really interesting.

Speaker 1:          02:29:06       Which explains that she had this background in marketing and mass marketing and you know, is obviously whether or not she's entirely invested in these ideas. She's obviously aware that she's marketing her ideas towards a very specific group and she's got these Beta males that cling to her and are attached to which are hilarious human beings. Have you heard my theory about the. It's actually a real top secret fucker strategy. Excuse me. Sneaker fucker. Sneaker fuckers. No, I can't wait. There you go. That's, I think it's. I'm not sure if it was a term that was introduced by Richard Dawkins. I can't remember who it was, but he called it speak if Dawkins called misspeaking. Maybe Jamie can pull it up, but anyways, it basically refers to some species where males come in different phenotypes, in other words, different physical manifestations, so there might be, say for example, that type of fish species where the typical male is a whatever, a big big phenotype, whatever that is.

Speaker 1:          02:30:07       Then there are other males that mimic the phenotype of females, so when the male standing around looking to protect his area that that male who looks like a female will sneak in and then get some quick calculations with some of the females that otherwise should be inaccessible to him and that became known as a sneaker fuckers strategy in zoology and I argue I haven't tested it, but I think it it, it, it would, it would, it will be interesting to do so that some of these sort of social justice warrior, Beta males are engaging in a form of sneaker fuckers strategies. What do you think? One hundred percent, 100 percent. Without a doubt. I mean, you have to do what you gotta do it. There's a desperation involved, like if you can't be, you know, this beautiful Stud Mail that all these women falling. I'm too short and too short.

Speaker 1:          02:31:02       I'm not existent and give me a chance. You know, you're shorter than me. Dude. You're fucking know I'm finished. It's done. But you know what? There is research that shows this study. Get ready defensive. No, not at all. You're ready. You're ready. What? So you bring in a guy to a room and only thing that you manipulate is the ascribed status, academic status that you give to a guy. He comes into a room and in one, in one version of the experiment, he's a assistant professor. In the second version, he's an associate professor of the third version. He's a famous world famous professor. Then when he steps out, the only thing that you test is people's perception of his height. His height magically becomes taller as his ascribed academic status goes up. And so I always joke that I may be only from my phone, but I'll tell you I'm seven foot four baby.

Speaker 1:          02:31:55       I'll tell you that. That's hurtful. No, it's not. I feel safe. I feel very uncomfortable. I mean, on a really good day where the Harris Spike five, 600 actually. Somebody really good data. I was in a photo. You'd measure that man. Was it a photo yesterday with Dave Rubin? And I did his show and so on. And somebody wrote. He goes, oh, I learned something new. I thought the Godfather was much taller. We gotta wear stilts. I got to wear stuff. I got to wear the Rubio heels. Maybe. What's a Rubio Hill? Rubio. The, the, the presidential candidate has wasn't he? Wasn't there a rumor that he was patting his heels? Make himself real? That's what I'd heard. I don't know. I wouldn't be shocked. When you think about political circles and what kind of manipulation matters. Yeah. There's so much manipulation going on there with image and even so many different consultants.

Speaker 1:          02:32:50       I mean they have that on television shows. I can only imagine what it would be like. Well, when, when George Bush was debating, I don't know if it was carrie, I can't remember which one, uh, his, his camp had to come up with all sorts of rules of what kind of camera shots you can do and so on, so that he doesn't look at his heels. Isn't it beautiful how everything I say is validated by Jamie Jesus Christ. It's believable. Fucking four inch heels on. I love Jamie. I should have him around everywhere. Like when I'm in class I say something and he just pops this stuff up. First of all, those would be seriously uncomfortable. Well, okay. Well hold on, hold on. Now. How much taller those things in like cowboy boots, cowboy boots or like that? That's at least three inches. Those are bigger than three inches.

Speaker 1:          02:33:31       Those are. Well maybe you're right. Those are giant. So he's a short guy. How tall is Rubio? I. Oh yeah, he has giant heels because look at those Italian shoes. That's not normal for those ones on the left. That's not normal that that's by design. Yeah, there you go. You got to just suck it up, man. Deal with the height is five foot six. He could get any woman he wants in the world. Who's that guy? Oh, for the love of God. What are you talking about? Lionelle. Messy. You don't know who that is? No. Who is that? Why you're looking at me? Funny. Last time it was demetrius mighty mouse. Johnson. I don't know. Those tend to shut your mouth. Greatest pound for pound fighter in several lived. Dare you? Leah now is the greatest soccer player who ever lived. Oh, soccer. That's okay. Right? But the godly

Speaker 2:          02:34:18       sport he ever really. It's just not something I'm interested in. This one is five foot six. He said, you know what? I saw that guy on television. They were doing some special on his, uh, his, his movement and what he can do to balls. Not like my balls but like soccer balls and how he can manipulate them. And it was fucking spectacular. He's an incredible, incredible athlete, but I didn't know what his name was. Yeah. Okay. There you go. Okay. You should, you should. You should show his wife at some point. I'm sure she's not as fuck. It's okay. You don't show it. I get it, but um, yeah, but this guy running for president as nothing to do, like she's as Christ the guy's boring. Nobody gives a fuck. It's not a leader. It's like Jeb Bush. Jeb Bush, not a leader. That's why you had to back out of it.

Speaker 2:          02:35:03       You know Ted Cruz, not a leader. You know, they're, they're hanging their hat on this guy that most people see right through because there's certain, there's a, there's a, there's a thing that happens when you talk to that guy where his intellect, like Ted Cruz, like maybe he's intelligent. Maybes I don't, I don't know. Supposedly went to Harvard supposedly is very wise. The way he talks, the way he establishes himself, the way he communicates is not enough. It's not enough to run the world. We all recognize it. He, he's not. He's not powerful enough in his ideas. Bernie sanders might be a crazy old socialist. He might be, but when that guy speaks with passion, like I buy it, you buy it. It doesn't exude a wind penis. No, it doesn't exude a wimp. He's got terrible posture. He's got terrible posture, he looks very unhealthy, but he's willing to stand up for his beliefs and he speaks with clarity and he speaks with a certain amount of force.

Speaker 2:          02:36:01       And uh, I don't think, I don't think he's the king, you know, but I think we live in a time where only assholes want to be president. You know, look this, this president thing is not going to last. It's not, it's not going to last. No, I think it's like fucking, it's like a Morse code. It's like we need something better. Like this is stupid. It's like we have Morse code and we also have cell phones. Well, you're not gonna use fucking Morse code. It's goofy. And this Internet thing that we have created this way of establishing information or expressing information, it is so far superior to anything that existed back when they invented the electoral college or representative government that, that voting and, and having a leader, one single hire, primate leader, one singer, single top eight that runs all the other apes. It's dumb.

Speaker 2:          02:36:48       It's dumb. You can't one person being president. He's a fucking really stupid idea. It just doesn't make any sense, but who makes the decisions? That should be a lot of people should be a gigantic council of really intelligent governance. Yes. One hundred percent. I think it is already. It is already. It's a figurehead more than it is anything. If that doesn't explain why Obama shifted almost all of his policies that he said that he was going to do once he got into office, once he actually got into office, change. So many of the things he including his idea and stance on whistleblowers. There was a big part of his hope and change website that they had to redact. So who? Who believes that the president really is responsible for the entire country really is the one guy that runs the entire show, I think almost no one now.

Speaker 2:          02:37:31       Almost no one, so it's a ridiculous figurehead position that I think we need to stop. We need to stop pretending that we have a king. We need to stop. We need to figure out a way to have an effective form of government with a giant group of really intelligent people that vote on it. People that have proven to be intelligent and objective and well educated and have a reasonable reason to response to all these different various the parliamentary system of the US, Canada or Britain would probably be more akin to what you're talking about maybe, but you still have trudeau. I mean you still have a figurehead, you still have a one. Figurehead is a bad idea and I think it's a bad idea because I think that this hope and this idea that we need a king, we need a a number one primate.

Speaker 2:          02:38:17       I mean that's really what it is. It's these are like chimpanzee hierarchy systems that have existed for thousands and millions of years, but you don't think that humans succumb to the same dominance hierarchies. I just don't think we need it anymore. So I think we're moving towards this idea of a global community moving towards this idea of a, of a world with the boundaries that we have had in the past oftentimes have been because we try to stay safe. We try to establish borders. We want to stay safe. I want to keep people together and to keep all the outsiders out. We need a king. We need a king to king, to the guard. The border is a king to lead us into war. I just think that's less and less relevant today and that it's more and more relevant to have a large group of very informed people that can help a large group of people that are collectively calling themselves a country.

Speaker 2:          02:39:08       Plato talks about philosopher kicks, right? He talks about that. Those who should lead should be the wise philosophers and assuming you sort of an amalgamation of those guys, be the Godfather. Maybe they, you were born in another country. You're fighting, but you're changing the constitution for me. Ah, we tried for Arnold Schwarzenegger until he got popped. Right. But what's the deal with him now doing those video game commercials? I mean, does it not seem goodness, scratch paper, I'm going to pay for that divorce. A lot of money. I bought it. I mean he's doing movies, doing a lot of different things. So I probably came to him with a big deal and you know, it's a funny commercial and they're all attacking. I'm trying to get an iphone. Yeah. Fuck. It doesn't bother me. It's a bother, you know. But I mean it seems like for former governor.

Speaker 2:          02:39:51       Yeah, I mean maybe it's governor anymore. Yeah. Okay. Fair enough. Yeah. But I don't spend too much time thinking about it. I mean, it would be weird if push started doing one of those Bush. The president what it. Yeah. The current guy, you know, the, the former president, President George W started doing a commercial for a video game where he's running away from a bunch of assassins are trying to steal his phone. It would get really weird. Right. You know, or if Obama left office and started doing commercials for Shit, you know, I mean is there a law against that? If a black president doing commercials, like a former president, like representing Pepsi Cola or something like that. And I suspect not. What would be the law and would fall under what rubric? I don't know. I just. You never seen it? No wonder why a violation, if you like, in quotes of the presidential office.

Speaker 2:          02:40:40       Right? Well, I think one thing that would hinder them is the financial reward of being a president is really about those gigantic speeches that they give. You know, Hillary Clinton. Here's, here's a fucking a crazy one. Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton have made hundreds of millions of dollars in speeches. They gave their daughter a $3,000,000 wedding party, $3,000,000. The masses, they're just like you and me will. This just should show you how insanely fucked up political system in this country, and that's why a president, it would actually be a negative to them if they had any mark on their record like doing a pepsi commercial, I can. Whatever Pepsi would pay them, it wouldn't be enough because like a guy like Bill Clinton, he makes unfucking believable amounts of money and he was at least a partially disgraced president, but it doesn't matter. It's still didn't harm his financial. The financial possibilities. Do you think it'll ever be the case where a sitting US president can claim to be an atheist?

Speaker 2:          02:41:49       I think an agnostic is more likely than an actual atheist in the atheist is someone who says, I don't believe in God. No, God, no. I think more likely someone that could say, I don't know about you know, or someone who is. Is there anybody that chooses to engage in a bunch of different traditional practices of worship but doesn't necessarily believe in the God has as a politician, someone who tries to go into a Jewish synagogue and then one day and then do all these trades when it's campaigning season I put do they wear the garb and do cert, the service, so I could send you a photo. Ether police pulled them up. There's a bunch of photos of Justin Trudeau being able to. I'm done with that guy too to show he's. He's in every extremist mosque in Canada. Prostrating himself as a, as a, as a sort of a Muslim that.

Speaker 2:          02:42:42       Did he do that to get into the office a lot? What else would he have done then? Once he's in office, then how does he behave? I'm not sure. It's only been 100 days, so we'll have to. I reserved judgment, but uh, I'm not sure that I liked that very much. Yeah. Well, it's problematic when you support any ideologies that really just don't make sense. Yeah. And that's, we're not talking about like meditation or anything else where you're talking about like really strict guidelines for living and they don't make sense and they're, they're ancient, you know, in a lot of ways. Those places where those guidelines were established. Where was the cradle of civilization where civilization first emanate in first took off and I have this sort of joke that I never, I never really figured out how to do it on stage, but that essentially the Middle East is like the townies of the world.

Speaker 2:          02:43:34       Do you know what a townie? Yes. Actually, last time we were on, I didn't know that that terminal west. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. We talked about it last time. It's just like think that patterns are intensely hard to break and it's one of the reasons why the United States is the most as far as like artistically one of the most diverse places in the world and as far as our ability to express ourselves in film, in music, in standup comedy and things along those lines and even in podcasting, it's the most diverse and the most potent and it's because we're the people that escaped exactly all the other spots. You know, my, my grandparents came from Italy and Ireland and they all came over on a boat when they were young and they established themselves in the east coast and that's where my parents were born and that's where I was born and it's, these are just like cup second, third generation immigrants that we're trying to get the fuck away from the horrors of Europe and they tried to find a new place with new opportunity and the escape.

Speaker 2:          02:44:27       The tradition of the past and the tradition of this new place was different. It was different. It was more open, it was more more. There was more hope. There was, there wasn't a caste system, you know, like there is an England, I mean there's like a very clear class system that goes on in a lot of countries throughout the world that has existed back from the days when they had kings. By the way in Canada, the Canadian government, I can't remember exactly when, specifically to avoid that caste system. The, the, the royal caste system, uh, made it a law that Canadians can't be knighted because any country that's under the Commonwealth, so you're Nigerian or you're Indian, you could be knighted by the queen. You become sir dame so on. Canadians can't. Precisely because the argument was that the Canadian ethos is contrary to having these hierarchical, royal titles.

Speaker 2:          02:45:17       So I could never be served godfather good. I liked that. You don't want to be assertive. I think there's real problems in a established caste systems like that. Real problems that are intensely hard to break. And I think that the beauty of America is that you can come here with nothing and become somebody. And the real lesson in that is not that America is different. It's really everybody is somebody being held back by tradition and you're being held back by these, these parameters and these, these guidelines that are set in place by people that had a very limited amount of information to work with. They didn't, they didn't understand the consequences of these rules. They didn't understand the consequences of these, these patterns of behavior that you're forcing people to follow in. And that's why America, you know, in a lot of ways represents still like the beacon of freedom to people. I mean there's a lot of problems with America, huge amount of problems with America, but that alone that it represents the most recent of the big countries, the most recent of the nation. And I don't know if it's coincidentally the big one, right? The super power. I mean, I don't know if that's a coincidence.

Speaker 3:          02:46:24       Earlier we were talking about friendships, so let me link that to some of the stuff that you're talking about America. So one of the arguments as to why Americans seem to form more sort of Ephemera, transient friendships, you know, not as. I mean, it might be a stereotype, but I can tell you that when I was a graduate student in the, in the US, all the non American students complained that Americans are very quick to be friendly with you, but they don't form the same tight bonds. That's interesting. I've never heard that before, but listen to the story. So I thought about it and I thought, well that can't be. It can't be inherently that Americans are more shallow. So what might be some reasons, and so I actually talk about this, not in this book, but in an earlier book of mine, 2007 book that the fact that Americans face greater geographic mobility today.

Speaker 3:          02:47:12       I could be in Boston tomorrow. I can be an la and socioeconomic mobility. The stratum that I was born into is not necessarily the one that I might die in. So because of these various forms of mobility, it creates a more transient, a definition of friendship. Not that Americans can form strong bonds, but there is a bit of a shallowness to the original encounters because tomorrow I might be somewhere else. Whereas the guy who comes from Lebanon, where, where he's born as, where he's going to die, where his word is, as this contract is going to have a different definition of friendship if only because life is not as anonymous. It's not as open to mobility as it would be the case in say, California. That seems reasonable. It makes sense. That makes sense. You know, I, I think, uh, I probably saw you, I saw you. I saw you trying to poke a hole into it.

Speaker 2:          02:48:06       Makes Sense. Makes Sense. I mean we are in a lot of ways. I'm captive by the initial impulses of the people who created us and the land that they established, you know, in this place was established by people that were, were, were so transient. They, they got in a boat and they sailed away before they had pictures. But you know, I mean, there wasn't even fucking pictures when people came here in the 17 hundreds. They had a draw things, you know, you should look at this drawing. This is what's waiting for you on the other side of the ocean. It's only going to take three months. Don't be a pussy and you're likely to die. People don't want to get on a fucking plane for 10 hours and go to England. Oh, that's too far, but people. But that's a fucking dot. Even a day. You could wake up in, in, in Los Angeles, get on a plane. You could have dinner in London. That's incredible. That's insane. Is it Louis? Is it Louis Ck? Is that how you pronounce it?
